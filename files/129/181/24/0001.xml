1. In 1969 the Minister of Overseas Development published for the first time the United Kingdom memorandum to the Development assistance committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment to provide additional information about British developmentactivities. The 1971, 1972 and 1973 memoranda were also published, and thelatest memorandum, which was presented to the DAC in October 1974, is published with the same object. The memorandum covers United Kingdomdevelopment activities in the calendar year 1973 with special reference toaspects which the DAC regard as immediately relevant to their purposes.Because the memorandum has primarily been drafted for purposes ofinternational discussion, figures are expressed in dollars as well as sterling.2. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,established by a Convention in Paris in December 1960, is the principal forum for consultations at both Ministerial and official levels on economic issues ofcommon interest to members, who comprise most of the European and otherdeveloped countries. Its work embraces broad aspects of the world economy and its aims include the promotion of policies contributing to sound economic expansion in non-member countries in the process of economic development.3. The Development Assistance Committee is one of the specialistcommittees set up by OECD to achieve its aims. It is concerned with thevolume and effectiveness of resources made available to less developed countries.Members periodically review together the amount and the nature of their contributions to aid programmes, bilateral and multilateral, and consult on other relevant aspects of their development assistance policies. The memoran-dum now published is the current contribution by the United Kingdom to this process of review.4.  Participating in the work of the DAC are:Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden,Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Commissionof the European Economic Communities.5. It is estimated that up to the end of 1973 the DAC countries stillprovided about nine-tenths of the official and private capital received bilaterallyby the developing countries (Euro-currency borrowing not included). the share of DAC countries among the suppliers of financial resources (official and private) to the multilateral institutions is thought to have fallen below90 per cent for the first time in 1973, as a result of substantial subscriptions to world Bank bonds by a few oil producers.6. A detailed statistical account of United Kingdom aid is provided in&quot; British Aid Statistics&quot;. The latest edition of this was published in Januarythis year.

introduction. Preliminary United Kingdom economic aid figures for 1973 show netofficial disbursements as $645m. ( 263m.) and gross disbursements as $745m.( 304m.). The 1972 figures were $618m. ( 247m.) and $784m. ( 313m.)respectively.2. The United Kingdom acceded to the European Economic community in 1973 but no major new developments in the United Kingdom aid programmeflowed from this during the year. Although not relevant to the year underreview it is pertinent to mention that Her Majesty&apos;s Government announced in March 1974 that the Overseas Development Administration was again to be aseparate Ministry of Overseas Development with its , own Minister. Thechange does not affect the aid programme as such and it does not entail anychange in the United Kingdom&apos;s aid criteria which will continue to be therelative economic need for aid and its developmental value for the people ofthe country concerned.3. It is also pertinent to mention that the United Kingdom has, in 1974,accepted in principle the 0-7 per cent of GNP target for official developmentassistance; the United Kingdom will seek in the years ahead to move towards this target, but this must be subject both to the pace of its economic recovery andto the other calls upon its resources.4. In paragraph 3 of the United Kingdom&apos;s previous memorandum,reference was made to the setting up of a House of Commons Select Committeeon Overseas Development with terms of reference &quot; to consider United Kingdomassistance for overseas development, and to report thereon &quot;. The Committee,which was established in February 1973, published a report in July 1973which contained recommendations dealing with the United Kingdom&apos;s entry into Europe in so far as it affects its economic relations with developing countries. Following the change of Government in March 1974, a new committee was appointed with the same terms of reference as its predecessor.It decided to concentrate initially on the impact of oil price rises on developing countries, and the implications thereof for British overseas developmentpolicy, and the Committee published a report on its enquiry into this in July1974. Meanwhile, as explained elsewhere in this Memorandum, the UnitedKingdom is playing a full part in the international discussions which are currently taking place on the changing economic situation for developing countries caused by shifts in world commodity (including oil) prices.

Gross disbursements of official development assistance in 1972-73totalled $752m. ( 301m.); disbursements of net official development assistancewere $632m. ( 253m.).9. In 1973-74 the estimated gross official development assistancedisbursements were $782m. ( 319m.). The estimated net figure was $701m.( 286m.).Commitments10. The United Kingdom programme is controlled on a disbursementbasis and commitments are entered into and discharged at a rate intended togive rise to the approved level of disbursements. The level of bilateralcommitments at the end of 1972 was $833m. ( 333m.); at the end of 1973 itwas $898m. ( 366m.). Total bilateral expenditure of aid against commitmentsduring 1973 was $543m. ( 222m.). Multilateral commitments at the end of1973 totalled $143m. ( 58m.) compared to $150m. ( 60m.) at the end of 1972.New commitments of all categories of official development assistance were$774m. ( 316m.) in 1973 compared with $897m. ( 359m.) in 1972.Aid VolumeDisbursements5. In 1973 gross disbursements of official development assistance (includingvarious transactions not encompassed in the aid programme) and other officialflows (comprising certain Commonwealth Development Corporation disburse-ments, some of which may be financed under the aid programme but nottreated as official development assistance, and a number of miscellaneousgrants that are classified as official flows to developing countries although notqualifying as official development assistance) total $745-2m. ( 303-9m.)compared with $784-3m. ( 313-5m.) in 1972.-ai6. Net disbursements of total official flows, i.e. gross disbursements lessamortization repayments on past aid loans to developing countries, totalled$644-5m. ( 262-8m.) in 1973 compared with $617-8m. ( 247m.) in 1972.
11. Disbursement forecasts are reviewed during the course of each financialyear and steps are taken to control commitments and their discharge accordingto whether the forecasts are high or low. Methods of improving forecastingare continually being sought in order to achieve the fullest disbursement ofthe approved programme, and to this end refinements to the disbursementforecasting system have recently been introduced. It has now been agreedthat the previous limit of  5m. over-expenditure which ODM has been allowedto carry over from one year to the next, to help avoid end-of-year difficulties,should be raised to  10m.Geographical Distribution12. The table below shows the geographical distribution of gross bilateralofficial development assistance and other flows for the five years 1969-73:	1969		1970		1971		1972		1973	$m.	(fin.)	Sm.

( 191m.) in1973; this was 80 per cent of the total bilateral flows. Of the Commonwealthtotal, $53m. ( 22m.) or 11 per cent went to dependencies and $24m. ( 10m.)or 5 per cent went to the West Indian Associated States. $58m. ( 24m.) or10 per cent of the total, went to the least developed, another $242m. ( 99m.)or 42 per cent to other countries with a GNP per head of less than $350, while$43m. ( 17m.) or 7 per cent went to OPEC countries mostly in the form of technical assistance.13. Fluctuations in the rate of annual disbursements to particular countriesdo not necessarily result from changes in policy towards them: annual dis-bursement levels are dependent on many factors and may vary from yearto year.Prospects for 1974 onwards14. The gross aid programme for 1974-75 at current prices is $891m.( 363-4m.). This could be expected to produce [calendar year grossdisbursements in 1974 of about $858m. ( 350m.). Estimated capital repaymentsin 1974 are $112m. ( 46m.) producing a likely &quot;net disbursement figureagainst the aid programme of about $745m. ( 304m.) &quot;. Estimated receipts of interest in 1974 are $119m. ( 49m.). The United Kingdom Aid programme for 1975-76 to 1978-79 is being determined as part of the Governmenfs reviewof all public expenditure.Commonwealth Development Corporation15. Loans made to the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC)by the United Kingdom Government totalled $35m. ( 14m.) in 1972 and$26m. ( 11m.) in 1973; $37m. ( 15m.) in 1972-73 and $39m. ( 16m.) in 1973-74.The total sum invested by the Corporation at the end of 1973 was $433-3m.( 180-7m.).
16. In 1973, the Government continued the interest waiver arrangements under which advances to CDC are made on concessionary terms. The furtherarrangement introduced in 1972 whereby advances to CDC for renewablenatural resources projects carry a specially high concessionary element wasalso continued. Agricultural projects formed one-third of the total value ofnew commitments approved by the CDC Board in 1973. This is a considerablylarger proportion than in previous years.17. During 1973 the Corporation was authorised to operate in two additional countries outside the Commonwealth, bringing the total to eight.Financial Terms and ConditionsTerms of Aid Disbursed in 197318. Of the total of gross official development assistance and other officialdisbursements amounting to $745m. ( 304m.) in 1973, $469m. ( 191m.) or63 per cent was in grant or grant-like form (that is including technical assistance and contributions to multilateral agencies); $203m. ( 83m.) or 27 per centwas as loans on interest-free terms; $18m. ( 7m.) or 2 per cent was disbursementson loans provided at fixed concessionary rates of interest; $2m. ( lm.) or lessthan 1 per cent was disbursements from earlier loans at market rates of interest(including loans with interest waivers), and $53m. ( 22m.) or 7 per cent was inthe form of overseas investment by the CDC. Overall the terms of government-to-government loans disbursed in 1973, omitting flows through the CDC,provided a weighted average grant element of 74-7 per cent.Terms of Aid Committed in 197319. The total value of new commitments of official development assistancein 1973 was $774m. ( 316m.) of which $476m. ( 194m.) or 61-5 per cent wasin grant form (including technical assistance taken to be the same asdisbursements and contributions to multilateral agencies) and $298m. ( 121m.)was in loans. Of the total value of new official development assistance loancommitments entered into during the year, 69 per cent was interest-free and93 per cent carried a grace period for capital repayments. The combinedweighted grant element of official development assistance loans was 65 per cent.When taken together with grant commitments, the grant element of the total was $667m. ( 272m.) or 86 per cent of the commitments.20. The bulk (69 per cent) of loan commitments continue to be interest-free.Where loans bear interest it is at fixed concessionary rates ranging from 2 percent to 6 per cent. This pattern of loans provides flexibility in the terms ofUnited Kingdom lending to those recipient countries for which interest-bearingloans are considered appropriate and gives the ability to harmonise the terms ofUnited Kingdom loans with those provided by other DAC members.The DAC Recommendation on Financial Terms and Conditions21. The United Kingdom complied in 1973 with the main objectivecontained in the revised Terms Recommendation which came into force on1 January, 1973, by attaining an average grant element of 86 per cent (againstthe target of at least 84 per cent) in its total official development assistancecommitments.  The United Kingdom is also making every effort to attainii8
the special target set in the Recommendation for aid to the least developed countries which provides inter alia that the average grant element of all officialdevelopment assistance commitments from a donor should be at least 86 percent to each least developed country over a period of three years. Aid to theleast developed countries is provided as a mixture of interest-free loans and grants in order to meet this target and already in the first year of the three-year period, the United Kingdom has achieved a grant element of at least 86 percent in all but 3 of the 21 least developed countries to which it committed aidin 1973.Criteria for Appropriate Terms and Conditions22. The basis of United Kingdom policy towards the terms of government-to-government aid loans continues to be one of adapting these terms to meetthe economic circumstances of the recipient country, taking especially intoaccount income per head and the prospects for its balance of payments bearing that mind debt service liabilities arising from debts already contracted. The termsof aid extended to the recipient country by other donor countries are alsotaken into account. This policy conforms not only to the DAC Recommenda-tions on Financial Terms and Conditions in relating the terms of aid on acase-by-case basis to the circumstances of each less-developed country or group of countries, but also with current DAC thinking on the problems of theindebtedness of developing countries. The policy has been followed regularlyby the United Kingdom in consortia and consultative group discussions of the aid to be given to individual countries.Analysis of Re-financing and Consolidation Operations23. The major &quot; re-financing &quot; operation in the aid programme in 1973-74as in the previous year, was a further interest-free loan to India amounting to$19-62m. ( 8m.) to reimburse the Government of India for certain repayments of capital and interest made on a number of aid agreements dating from theyears 1958 to 1966. This re-financing was made available in 1973-74 to theGovernment of India as the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution towards a multilateral scheme sponsored by the Aid India Consortium for debt relief,amounting to approximately $180m. in each of years 1972-73 and 1973-74,and designed to alleviate the burden of debt servicing on the Indian balance ofpayments arising from the terms on which past aid loans were given. Theeffect of the scheme is to release the equivalent amount of free foreign exchangewhich can then be applied to the purchase of essential imports, and it is con-sidered to be one of the most useful ways in which donors can help thedevelopment of that country. The terms for the re-financing loan were thosewhich the United Kingdom applies to all its other official developmentfinancing to India, i.e. interest-free with a maturity of 25 years and a 7-yeargrace period, giving a grant element of 77 per cent.Procurement Policy24. Whilst the extent of procurement in a donor country which may result from the tying practices of that country is not fully revealed by statistics ofcontractually tied aid, the proportion of United Kingdom bilateral aid fullytied to United Kingdom goods and services in 1973 was 50 per cent (leavingout of account re-financing, and the cost of technical assistance and aid for
compensation and pensions where expenditure as between sterling and localcurrencies cannot be clearly identified). In addition to the procurementfrom this fully-tied aid, further procurement in the United Kingdom arises from the considerable amount of bilateral financial aid tied to United kingdom or local goods and services, the proportions of which are not always laid downin advance in specific terms. The estimated percentage of further procurementin the United Kingdom which results from such aid was 20 per cent, making an estimated total of effective tying and procurement of bilateral aid of 70 percent, without regard to any further procurement which may result from untiedaid.25. Although United Kingdom bilateral aid is normally tied to the purchaseof British goods and services, the United Kingdom is ready, in the case of independent countries, to consider untying a limited part of its financial aid for meeting the local costs of projects in exceptional cases where this is judgedappropriate; for the British Dependencies the circumstances may require agreater proportion of the aid to be devoted to local costs or local procurement.Overall, therefore, the United Kingdom aid programme continues to provide asubstantial amount of flexibility in the treatment of local costs. For a numberof countries, particularly the Dependencies, the West Indian Associated Statesand independent countries in Southern Africa, waivers of procurementrestrictions were granted to allow procurement of specified categories of goods from third countries in the light of the particular circumstances which applied.For all countries, the maximum permitted foreign content in goods financed from tied aid is 20 per cent, so facilitating the administration and use of tiedaid. Budgetary aid, of which the United Kingdom provided $14-5m. ( 5-9m.)in 1973, by its nature cannot be tied formally to overseas procurement;however, the arrangements with the recipient countries are that offshoreprocurement supported by this budgetary aid will be from the United Kingdomexcept where it would be clearly uneconomic to do so.26. At the DAC High-level Meeting in October 1973, all DAC member countries formally agreed to provide their financial contributions to multilateralinstitutions free for procurement at least in those countries that are members or associate members of those institutions or are recognised by the institutionsconcerned as significant contributors. The United Kingdom has in factprovided its contributions to multilateral institutions on this basis for a numberof years.Policies regarding Multilateral Contributions27. The third and final annual deposit of promissory notes for the UnitedKingdom&apos;s contribution to the Third Replenishment of IDA was made inNovember 1973 and encashment of the promissory notes already issued toIDA under the first three Replenishments continued during the year. agreement on proposals for a Fourth Replenishment of IDA to be committed over thethree-year period beginning 1 July, 1974, was reached in September 1973: theUnited Kingdom share of the total of $4-5 billion would be $499-5m. payable in sterling at  206 - 464m. or about 11 per cent of the total Replenishment. InJuly 1974, Parliament approved a draft Order which would authorise the full contribution once the Replenishment had become effective, and simultaneouslyanother draft Order which would enable up to one-third of the United Kingdom

and to see that suitable vehicles are readily available for the transport offood and supplies in disaster areas.Aid to Education32. In the United Kingdom&apos;s memorandum of last year (paragraphs 51-56)reference was made to the development of some of the individual activitiesinitiated in earlier years. This continues. A particular illustration is thegrowth of the programme for the provision of books, in order both to help toalleviate the chronic shortages of essential books in the libraries of academicand educational institutions, to provide cheap books for students, and toassist in the development of libraries, local publishing and book distribution.This year it may be appropriate to offer some more general comments onUnited Kingdom policy on aid to education and the context in which it is given.A general review on this subject was published in 1970 (Education in DevelopingCountries). What was said there remains valid in the main but the situationhas changed in some respects.33. There is a ferment in the thinking about education and aid toeducation in the developing countries. There are signs, for example, of aquestioning of the quantitative targets for formal primary, secondary andtertiary education on which so much emphasis has previously been placed,and of a switch of interest from academic to technical and vocational education,and from formal to non-formal education. But the evidence is inconclusiveand the situation varies very considerably from country to country. Moreover,much of the ferment has to do with the nature of the economy of each countryand indeed of society, rather than education in isolation. Such considerationswill lead the United Kingdom to review the focus and application of its basicpolicies.34. In any event there can be no panaceas and no simple, generalised,solutions to the problems relating to education in developing countries.Manpower planning, curriculum reform, the use of new media, basic educationand similar concepts are individually and in themselves no solution thougheach may make a valuable contribution. The United Kingdom is thereforeincreasingly seeking to relate such concepts to specific situations rather thanoffering generalised solutions or assertions.35. At the same time the developing countries themselves are becomingincreasingly conscious of their own responsibilities and sensitive about attemptsto prescribe decisions for them, however well-intended. Future policies and theform of their applications must, for this reason also, emerge from sustaineddiscussion with the representatives of the developing countries with theirincreasingly disparate needs.36. In the application of its aid the United Kingdom is already puttinggreater emphasis on country programmes and sees its aid to education in anyindividual country as part of a total programme of aid for that country,directed so far as is possible to assisting with the creation of employmentand benefiting in particular the poorer sections of the community. New aidschemes may, of course, be necessary along with adapting existing schemes tonew areas of interest and changing circumstances.  The amount of United
Kingdom aid available for education in any particular country will be limitedand it will be applied so far as possible to influence the development of theeducational system as a whole.Aid for Social PurposesPopulation Policy37. British population aid policy was reviewed in 1973 and the highpriority accorded to aid for population matters was reaffirmed. It wasdecided also to increase support to the United Nations Fund for PopulationActivities, the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the OECDDevelopment Centre&apos;s Population Programme and to renew efforts to increasebilateral aid in this field.Administration Overseas38. The Journal of Administration Overseas, produced in the ODM andnow in its 25th consecutive year of publication, continues to make a small butvaluable contribution to development studies. It provides a forum for thecommunication of knowledge and experience over the whole field of publicadministration, and offers students, teachers and practitioners material forcomparative studies.Youth Programme39. The United Kingdom played a leading part in helping to set up theCommonwealth Youth Programme. This Programme is designed to assistin the elimination of unemployment and the alleviation of its effects amongyoung people in the Commonwealth and to encourage their participation inthe process of national development. It comprises a series of training schemes,youth exchange facilities, research arrangements, and information services.The United Kingdom will contribute 30 per cent of the Programmed expenditurein its first three years up to a maximum of  300,000.Technical AssistanceTechnical Assistance Agreements40. Paragraph 75 of last year&apos;s memorandum referred to the existence of a&quot; model&quot; agreement embodying the optimum terms and conditions of service,etc., for British Technical Assistance Officers which the United Kingdomlikes to see included in any agreement reached with an overseas country. The&quot; model&quot; now includes appropriate clauses to cover British Council activitiesin the country concerned.Appraisal and Evaluation41. Ex-post evaluations are currently being made of a selection of technicalassistance and capital aid projects and programmes approved in the past.Consideration is being given to the improvement of procedures for the appraisaland evaluation of technical assistance projects. The fundamental objectiveis to obtain more efficient and better integrated programmes of technicalassistance.
Recruitment of Operational Personnel and Advisers42. During 1973, bilateral appointments made under the auspices ofODM to advisory and operational posts under various bilateral TechnicalAssistance arrangements totalled 2,272 (compared with 2,205 in 1972). Ofthis number the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrationsmade 228 operational non-educational appointments (336 in 1972) on behalfof ODM, the Council for Technical Education and Training for OverseasCountries (TETOC) 75 appointments, (59 in 1972), and the British Council254 appointments (147 in 1972); appointments to international organisations,including the United Nations, remained almost constant at 206 (209 in 1972).43. In the Education Sector, the figure for school teacher appointmentswas 634 and teacher trainers 57.44. Difficulty has been experienced in recruitment for non-educationaloperational posts, particularly for key professional skills, and efforts are beingmade to bring about an improvement in this area. Particular attention isbeing directed to emoluments and to career continuity, two of the main factorsinfluencing recruitment; there are of course other main factors such as livingconditions and personal security in particular countries, which are beyondthe control of recruiting agencies, and in some professions, such as medicine,there is an absolute shortage of candidates which additional inducement cando little to remedy.45. In 1972 a change was made in the method of assessing allowancespayable to certain categories of British staff employed in the public servicesof developing countries and in 1973 it was decided that salary supplements forall designated British operational staff should be fixed by reference to the levelsand movements of salaries in Britain. The process of converting the remainderwas put in hand and is expected to take about a year to complete.46. World-wide inflation made it necessary to carry out more frequentreviews of salaries and allowances, and a review of the salary supplementationformula was undertaken to give more flexibility for fixing rates of supplementto attract and retain staff in difficult areas such as scarce skills or unattractiveliving conditions.47. The ODM initiated a review of the arrangements needed for the supplyof operational staff after March 1976 when the existing salary supplementationagreements expire. The review will estimate the continuing need and how itshould be met.Volunteers48. As in 1972 the four independent sending societies supported by theODM were Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), the United Nations Association(UNA), International Voluntary Service (IVS) and the Catholic Institute ofInternational Relations (CIIR). The British Volunteer Programme (BVP)continued its co-ordinating role on behalf of the ODM, the British Council(which acts as the Overseas Arm), and the sending societies.49. The number of graduate and other qualified volunteers in post at31 December, 1973, was 1,631, compared with the 1972 figure of 1,696; thecorresponding figures for cadets (mainly school leavers) were 31 and 70
respectively. About three-fifths of the volunteers are teachers, while the restare engaged mainly in nursing, agriculture, engineering and communitydevelopment. Demand is increasing for technical volunteers and teachertrainers rather than for secondary school teachers (other than in the fields ofEnglish, Mathematics, Science and vocational subjects). The demand is alsoincreasing for older and more experienced personnel. United Kingdomexpenditure in 1973 was $2-3m. ( 938,000).Training50. In 1973 the number of new arrivals for training in the United Kingdomunder regional technical assistance programmes exceeded 3,900, comparedwith some 3,300 in 1972 and 3,400 in 1971. Additionally, an estimated 520came to the United Kingdom in 1973 for courses in teacher training and teacheradministration under the Commonwealth Education Fellowship Scheme;the comparable figures for 1971 and 1972 are 495 and 551. The total numberof people who received training in Britain under the aid programme during1973 was about 14,450.51. In consultations with overseas governments at annual manpowerreviews increasing attention is being given to fields and purposes of study andtheir relationship to overall manpower requirements.Research and Development52. Within the United Kingdom&apos;s technical assistance programme, fundsare set aside each year for research and other scientific work in, or on behalf of,developing countries. There is a small fund from which specific researchschemes are financed. This amounted to $6-9m. ( 2-8m.) in 1972 and $7-4m.( 3-0m.) in 1973. Three criteria govern the acceptance of research projects:the work must be directed towards the gathering of new knowledge or thedevelopment of new techniques in direct relation to the needs of developingcountries; the knowledge of techniques concerned should be capable ofpractical usefulness within a reasonably limited period; and the problemswhich such knowledge or techniques aim to answer should be either global orregional in extent or, if at present the concern of a single country, of clearpotential relevance to other countries or regions.53. The financing of research outside geographical programmes ofassistance enables projects to be promoted as dictated by the importance of theparticular subject in the developing world generally rather than as determinedby the local priorities of individual countries. The assistance is providedthrough project support; through scientific institutions in the United Kingdom,both government and academic, which specialise in whole or in part in theproblems of developing countries; and through financial support of researchinstitutions in developing countries.54. The research supported has substantial tropical agriculture andtropical medicine components and also includes work under the followingclassifications: trypanosomiasis (a separate section), economic and social,population, veterinary, education, pest control, fisheries, geology, forestry andengineering (a new category). Project support in which the United Kingdomcollaborates with overseas countries on particular research projects continuesto be promoted.
55. The ODM also maintains through its research provision an OverseasUnit at the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL), an OverseasDivision at the Building Research Establishment (BRE) and an Overseas Unitat the Hydraulics Research Station (HRS). The TRRL and BRE sectionsundertake work directed to the solution of technical problems arising in thedeveloping countries, answer overseas enquiries, disseminate information andorganise training courses both in the United Kingdom and overseas. TheOverseas Unit of the TRRL is concerned with research, for example, intopavement strengthening and road surfacing, landslide prevention, etc., and incollaboration with the World Bank has been undertaking a study in Kenyato develop a highway design model to allow the optimum road standards for agiven level of traffic to be specified, based on minimum total transport costs.The Overseas Division of the BRE is continuing to apply its knowledge of thetechniques of industrialised building to the needs of developing countriesand to this end has developed, for example, a special system of on-site batterycasting for the production of concrete panels. The Overseas Unit of theHRS is engaged on a research programme of very wide validity. It coverssuch things as the optimum design of small reservoir dams, the principlesgoverning the intrusion of salt water upriver estuaries, and the control of airentrainment vortices at water intakes.56. In a similar way, the ODM calls upon the help of many United Kingdomuniversity departments and on the expertise of the research stations of theAgricultural Research Council (ARC) and Medical Research Council (MRC).57. A recent development has been the setting-up in the ODM of anEnvironmental Co-ordination Unit to deal particularly with the scientific andtechnical aspects of requests from developing countries for environmentalspecialists and training and with the environmental aspects of developmentprojects. The Unit is also concerned with international environmentalprogrammes and is currently participating in some of the projects in theUNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme. Research in the environmentalfield will also be carried out through British scientific organisations, universities,individual experts, etc.58. In addition, the research aid programme continues to providebudgetary support for certain research bodies in developing countries, such asthe agricultural research institutions of the British Solomon Islands Protectorateand Malawi.59. Outside the research provision, funds continued to be provided in1973 to maintain a number of scientific and technical organisations, descriptionsof which follow below, specialising exclusively in the problems of developingcountries. Of these, the Tropical Products Institute, the Centre for OverseasPest Research, the Directorate of Overseas Surveys and the Land ResourcesDivision are all functional components of the ODM itself. In addition, theCentre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine and the Overseas Department of theNational Institute of Agricultural Engineering are financed mainly by annualsubventions from the ODM. The total cost of all these units was $8-3m.( 3 - 3m.) in 1972 and $8 -9m. ( 3 - 6m.) in 1973. In addition technical assistanceregional programmes provided $0- lm. ( 0-04m.) in 1972 and $0- lm. ( 0-05m.)in 1973 in respect of survey services.
60. The Tropical Products Institute (777) is concerned with post-harvesthandling, processing, quality control and storage of the products of renewablenatural resources, with local and overseas markets for them, and with industriesbased on them.61. The Centre for Overseas Pest Research (COPR) was formed in 1971from four existing units: the Anti-Locust Research Centre, the TropicalPesticides Research Unit, the Tropical Pesticides Research Headquarters andInformation Unit, and the Termite Research Unit. The Centre helps developingcountries to solve pest problems in the fields of agriculture and public health.Investigation and research, including research into pesticides residues intropical soils, and work on the development and application of moderntechniques of pest control are undertaken. The Centre also provides scientificinformation, advice and training.62. The Directorate of Overseas Surveys (DOS) specialises in land survey,air photography and map production while the Land Resources Division(LRD) investigates the problems of land use, for the development of agriculture,livestock husbandry and forestry.63. The Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine (CTVM) was establishedby the ODM at the Veterinary Field Station of the Royal (Dick) School ofVeterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh. The CTVM conducts researchin Edinburgh and countries overseas into problems related to tropical veterinarymedicine and animal health, and provides facilities for training United Kingdomoverseas postgraduate students in these fields.64. The Overseas Department of the National Institute of AgriculturalEngineering provides a technical service on all matters connected withagricultural engineering overseas. The Department investigates a low-costlabour intensive techniques and designs and develops agricultural tools andequipment suitable for use in developing countries, particularly implementsof a relatively simple kind, for example, animal-drawn cultivation units. TheDepartment also publishes a series of technical bulletins in which some of theequipment is described. These bulletins receive fairly wide overseasdistribution.65. Other United Kingdom institutions which receive financial supportfrom the ODM include:(a) the Overseas Division of the Institute of Geological Sciences, whichundertakes projects to determine the geological potential in developingcountries;(b) the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, to promote work in tropicalforestry, particularly tropical silviculture;(c) the Bureau of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases, which publishes monthlyabstracts of medical literature from all parts of the world thus helpingto provide a link between doctors, particularly those in developingcountries, who are remote from adequate library facilities and theircolleagues who are engaged in medical research. Over 150 countriessubscribe annually to these bulletins.The cost of this assistance amounted to $0-5m. ( 0-2m.) in 1973.
66. In 1973, the ODM continued to give financial support for programmesat the International Rice Research Institute and the International Institute ofTropical Agriculture and also contributed to the International Potato Centre;while a further contribution was made to the fund for establishing the Inter-national Centre for Agricultural Research in the Semi-arid Tropics. Thesecommitments resulted in total payments of $1 -Om. ( 0-4m.) in 1973. Supportfor these Centres is continuing in 1974, and in addition the ODM is contributingto the programme of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centreand the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture; and to funds to set upthe International Livestock Centre for Africa, the International Laboratory forResearch in Animal Diseases and the International Plant Genetic ResourcesBoard.Private SectorPrivate Investment67. The United Kingdom is an investor on a large scale in the developingworld and the contribution of private investment to the flow of resources fromthe United Kingdom to developing countries over the last few years has beenas follows:NET PRIVATE INVESTMENTShare of total for alloverseas countries$m.  m. Per cent1970 ...      ......       317 132                    161971 .........       234 96                    101972 .........       298 119                     81973 ..........        78 32                     2The estimates for individual years should be treated with considerable reservein attempting to deduce general trends; the various elements which make upthe total figure for net private investment fluctuate considerably from yearto year.Investment Insurance68. The United Kingdom has an overseas investment insurance schemewhich is comparable to those of other developed countries. The scheme,which is administered by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD)is available to insure new investment from the United Kingdom against thenon-commercial risks of war, expropriation and restrictions on remittances.The maximum period of insurance is 15 years, with provision for coveringearnings retained in the business up to 100 per cent of the initial contribution.The cost of cover is 1 per cent per annum on the amount currently at risk,plus \ per cent per annum on the amount of any commitment to cover additionalamounts in the future. Provision for this scheme was made in the OverseasInvestment and Export Guarantee Act, which became law in June 1972.69. Up to the end of 1973, ECGD had concluded 25 insurance agreementsin respect of 11 projects in Africa, 4 in Central America, 9 in Asia and 1 inOceania.70. Portfolio investments of $122,000 ( 50,000) or more which representat least 10 per cent of the equity of a venture are eligible for cover under theinvestment insurance scheme.II 18\\
Association of Aid with Private Investment71. The Overseas Investment and Export Guarantees Act 1972 alsoprovided for a scheme of financial support for pre-investment studies by UnitedKingdom private investors in developing countries. The scheme enabled theODM to reimburse half the cost of approved studies undertaken by potentialinvestors which led to a decision not to invest.72. During 1973, 19 Agreements were signed for pre-investment studysupport. The studies related to proposed investments in Indonesia (4),Mexico (3), Nigeria (2), Brazil, Falkland Islands, Guyana, Iran, Jamaica,Jordan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mauritania and Turkey. The ODM&apos;s contingentcommitment in respect of these studies was some $553,000 ( 225,000).Bilateral Investment Protection Agreements73. The United Kingdom will seek wherever possible to conclude bilateralinvestment protection agreements with developing countries for the reciprocalprotection of investments. The United Kingdom believes that such agreementswill help to secure fair treatment of private investment overseas by offeringmore specific protection for these investments. In the past year the UnitedKingdom initiated negotiations with a number of countries. It is hoped thatagreements will be concluded with some of these countries in the future.Export Credits Guarantee Department74. The net amount of credit in excess of 180 days in length extended tothe developing countries in 1973 was $281m. ( 115m.), compared with a totalof $524m. ( 214m.) in 1972. The total volume of credit extended to allcountries was $764m. ( 312m.) in 1973; net credit to developing countriesrepresents 37 per cent of this total. /75. Rising energy costs and the increased uptake of Eurocurrency fundsby the developing countries have tended to aggravate the already seriousdebt-servicing problem which many of them face. While ECGD, likeequivalent organisations in other countries, is naturally concerned aboutdeveloping countries&apos; indebtedness problems and will participate in anyacceptable overall plans designed to prevent default situations, it is clear thatexport credit institutions are not in a position to solve these problems alone.In any case, debt servicing in the final analysis is primarily the responsibilityof the borrower.76. Whilst there are not normally any direct consultations on debtservicing between ECGD and the Authorities of the importing countries,ECGD controls the volume of private credit to developing countries by assessingthe situation of the recipient country based, inter alia, on the overall amountof external debt to be serviced, and it is a standard ECGD requirement that anyregulation of the recipient country (such as prior approval/registration ofcredits) must be complied with. ECGD may also stipulate that a guaranteeof payment and/or sterling availability should be obtained from the CentralFinancing Authorities of the importing country to ensure that proper provisionis made for payment of the contract; and in addition, projects worth over  2m.in a limited number of developing countries are assessed as to their viabilityand developmental value before ECGD cover is agreed.
Use of Consultants77. British consultants through their work overseas, both commerciallyand under aid arrangements continue to play an important part in helping toformulate development plans. In 1973 total official expenditure on technicalassistance in respect of the services of consultants and other organisations inundertaking feasibility and other pre-investment investigations, and in theprovision of other kinds of management, operational and advisory services,was $13-7m. ( 5-6m.).78. 91 new feasibility and pre-investment studies were commissionedduring the year at an estimated total cost of $6-4m. ( 2-6m.), compared with94 such assignments in 1972 at an estimated cost of $8-4m. ( 3-3m.). Thefields covered once again included road, rail and other forms of transport (14);ports and harbour development (5); water supplies, sewerage, drainage andirrigation (21); agricultural (13); fisheries (4); mining, oil and minerals (14);posts, telecommunications and broadcasting (3); industry generally (4).79. In addition, 45 firms and other organisations were engaged in 1973 toprovide services other than feasibility and pre-investment surveys. The totalestimated cost of these was $2-9m. ( l-2m.). This compared with 52 suchengagements in 1972 at an estimated total cost of $2-7m. ( 1-lm.). Theseservices included advice and assistance on management organisation andtraining (8); power development (6); water supplies, irrigation, etc. (4);transportation (3); telecommunications (2); agricultural (4); industrial (6).Import Opportunities in the United Kingdom for Developing CountriesM 80. In 1973 the United Kingdom established an &quot; Import OpportunitiesOffice for Developing Countries &quot;. This office is financed by the ODM andoperates as an independent unit under the aegis of the ODM, the Departmentof Trade and the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry and it aims toprovide information and advice to exporters from developing countries wishingto do business in the United Kingdom to help promote their exports.Information about the office was provided for an OECD Development Centremeeting in March 1974.Private Non-profit Bodies81. Some 200 voluntary agencies, including church and missionarysocieties, provided approximately $54m. ( 22m.) in grants for development andrelief work overseas in 1973. About half this money was provided by fiveagencies. Their funds were mainly spent on agriculture, health and nutritionand education projects in a large number of developing countries, thoughemergency relief continued to make demands on their resources. A nationalappeal by the Disasters Emergency Committee, a co-ordinating body for fivevoluntary agencies, raised $3-7m. ( l-5m.) for relief in the Sahel and Ethiopia,in a matter of weeks.82. Liaison with the ODM and co-operation between the voluntaryorganisations themselves continued through the Voluntary Committee onOverseas Aid and Development (VCOAD), and similar bodies in Scotlandand Northern Ireland. Grants for this co-ordinating work totalled about$66,200 ( 27,000) in 1973.  The ODM also made a grant to the Standing
Conference of British Organisations for Aid to Refugees (SCOBOAR), whichbrings together British agencies concerned with refugee problems.83. The United Kingdom Standing Conference on the Second DevelopmentDecade, which was set up in 1971 to mobilise public opinion in support of theDecade, has been carrying out an extensive educational programme amongthe members of its 70 affiliated bodies. The programme has laid particularemphasis on aspects of rural development, appropriate technology, the role ofwomen and nutrition and has attracted the interest and support of specialisedgroups. The Standing Conference Population Working Group has contributedto the widespread publicity centring on the United Nations Population Yearwith its own report on Population and Development.84. The United Kingdom has not as a rule offered direct official financialsupport for projects overseas undertaken or sponsored by voluntary organisa-tions. It has taken the view that official and voluntary activities should beco-ordinated to the extent necessary to avoid duplication, and that officialadvice should be made available to voluntary agencies when required; but thatit is better for agencies to retain their relative freedom and flexibility toundertake projects which official criteria might not allow, and thus complementthe official aid programme. However, the ODM is carrying out a reviewof its relations with non-governmental organisations both in emergency andlong-term development activities. The United Kingdom has long collaboratedwith voluntary agencies in emergencies. In 1973 the United Kingdom paidfor the air freighting to Ethiopia of emergency food and medical suppliespurchased by the agencies; and it is also co-operating with them in a &quot; foodfor work &quot; scheme on road building and irrigation projects and in restockingfarms with oxen and seed in Wollo Province in Ethiopia. Co-operativeenterprises have since followed over the provision of motor transport in Ethiopiaand the Sahel.II.  CONSEQUENCES OF THE CHANGING ECONOMICSITUATION ON DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION85. The effects of the oil price rises in the last quarter of 1973, taken withthe boom in many commodity prices which began in 1972, and combinedwith poor food harvests in key areas, are creating a new pattern of need indeveloping countries. It was not possible to begin to identify this as a factorin managing aid programmes in 1973 itself. During the first half of 1974,however, the United Kingdom played a full part in international examinationof the implications of the sharp changes in the economic circumstances ofdeveloping countries in the two preceding years, including participation in theWashington Energy Conference and the Energy Co-ordination group, inOECD committees which examined various aspects of the situation, in thespecial session of the United Nations General Assembly and the follow-upad hoc Committee of 36, and in discussions in the IMF, the IBRD and the EEC.86. These recent dramatic changes have of course to be seen against thebackground of the continuing problem of under-development in the world.
These changes have, in the United Kingdom view, strengthened the case forinternational co-operation to reduce the divisions between rich and poorcountries and United Kingdom policies will continue to take account of thisaim as exemplified in the aims of the second United Nations DevelopmentDecade. Present discussions in the DAC and elsewhere should, in the UnitedKingdom view, seek to identify where guide-lines already elaborated fordevelopment strategy during the second Development Decade are susceptibleto change and where new emphases and possibly new policies are needed.Aid Volume87. The United Kingdom subscribed to the Declaration at the WashingtonEnergy Conference in February 1974 in which the traditional aid donorsconcerned stated that they would make strenuous efforts to maintain andenlarge the flow of official development aid and the United KingdomGovernment has said that it will seek to increase the provision of aid.Aid Distribution88. The United Kingdom has undertaken preliminary assessments of thedifferential effect of the rise in the price of oil and other commodities ondeveloping countries in the short and medium terms and has co-operatedwith OECD and others in refining such assessments. They will be takeninto account in planning future aid disbursements. Much of the UnitedKingdom aid programme for the years ahead is, however, already committedand much of it already goes to countries which have been hardest hit by oiland other price rises.United Nations Special Programme89. The United Kingdom is participating fully in international discussionsdesigned to bring assistance to the developing countries most seriously affectedby the rise in the price of oil and other commodities, and to involve thosecountries with increased financial surpluses in the international developmenteffort. As a member of the European Economic Community, the UnitedKingdom intends to make its main response to the United Nations emergencyoperation through the Community. Provided that other members of the inter-national community also contribute their share, the EEC has offered tocontribute one-sixth of the eventual total contributions up to $500m. to theworld emergency assistance effort over the next 12 months. It is the UnitedKingdom&apos;s profound hope that other donors will now come forward andsupport this positive move on the Community&apos;s part by announcing com-mensurate contributions. Should other donors fail to respond as adequatelyas the United Kingdom and the other members of the Community hope, theUnited Kingdom will consider how its present bilateral actions in favour ofthe most seriously affected countries should be supplemented. t90. The United Kingdom national reply to the Secretary-GeneraPs appealfor contributions to the United Nations emergency measures also mentionedindividual actions or commitments already undertaken by the British Govern-ment which have a bearing on the current crisis. The reply noted that thethree countries which have suffered by far the most severe damage appear tobe India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and that in the financial year 1973-74\\\\
these countries were already receiving about 32 per cent of total United Kingdombilateral aid. For India, the reply referred to the additional disbursement of$25m. ( 10m.) maintenance aid in March 1974, which produced a recordout-turn for the financial year of $167m. ( 68m.), and to expected disbursementsin 1974-75 exceeding $172m. ( 70m.). For Bangladesh, disbursements areexpected to increase substantially in financial year 1974-75 compared with the$20m. ( 8m.) in 1973. For Sri Lanka, our 1974 pledge for maintenance is$7m. ( 3m.) compared with $2m. ( lm.) in 1973.91. The reply also mentioned additional aid to the drought-affected areasof the Sahel, bilateral and multilateral, totalling $13m. ( 5 -3m.) in 1974;and to Ethiopia in connection with the drought and famine totalling $858,000( 350,000) in 1974. It referred to the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution ofabout $505m. ( 206m.) towards the fourth replenishment of IDA, and to theUnited Kingdom&apos;s intention to make an advance contribution in the eventof delay in the replenishments becoming effective. Finally, the reply mentionedthe United Kingdom participation in the World Food Programme, to which$8-154m. ( 3 -325m.) has been pledged for the present biennium, and in theEECs food aid programme, the total cost of which in 1974-75 might amountto approximately $37m. ( 15m.); and the United Kingdonfs increased pledgeto UNICEF of $3 -2m. ( 1 - 3m.) this year, compared with $1 -962m. ( 800,000)in 1973.International Flows92. The United Kingdom has participated fully in international discus-sions designed to involve those countries with increased financial surplusesin the international development effort. As a member of the EEC, the UnitedKingdom has subscribed to the Community&apos;s declaration that it is preparedto make a substantial contribution to international efforts to assist the hardesthit, provided that other members of the international community play theirparts also.Trade and Commodity Agreements v93. The United Kingdom has worked towards better access for goodsfrom non-Associated countries by way of the European Community&apos;sGeneralised Scheme of Preferences and the Scheme that took effect on1 January, 1974, was a significant improvement on its predecessor. The UnitedKingdom will continue to seek further improvements especially in respect ofgoods of interest to the Commonwealth Asian countries covered by the jointDeclaration of Intent. The United Kingdom will also continue to press foraccess to the European Market at a reasonable price for the quantities ofsugar sent to the United Kingdom by developing Commonwealth countriesunder the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. During the latter part of 1973 theUnited Kingdom participated in the early discussions of the Multilateral TradeNegotiations and will take an active part when the major negotiations getunder way in late 1974.Public and Parliamentary Opinion94. Public attention was captured in 1973 by drought and disastersituations in India, Ethiopia, and the Sahel.  Very full coverage was given
in the Press, on radio and television. The public&apos;s deep concern, reflected inthe form of letters to newspapers (and to the Government) and in collectionsfor relief funds (particularly in the case of Ethiopia following a televisiondocumentary), was all the more remarkable in that this was a time of seriousdomestic economic difficulty. It is not to be expected that the charitableinstincts of the public are matched by an understanding of the link betweenhunger, poverty and disease in disaster areas with the needs of long-termdevelopment; but leading journalists and broadcasters used the facts of thedisaster situations to demonstrate the wider needs of world development.They will have had some effect in instilling a sense of continuing concernfor the world&apos;s poor, extending beyond the instant concern that resulted insuch an immediate and generous charitable response.95. Government publicity, based upon informing public opinion aboutdevelopment problems as much as about aid, has supported the internationaltrend towards more aid for the poorest, and in the context of the oil crisishas tried to show the need for the special effort that would be needed to helpthose hardest hit. The official information service has worked in closeco-operation with the voluntary agencies and the media in promoting thisidea. The oil crisis, which affected petrol, electricity and other supplies inBritain made the task of mobilizing public opinion in favour of developmentthat much more difficult, although the quality Press and broadcasting mediacarried several background features explaining the effect of the oil price riseon the LDCs.96. Coverage by the media of social political questions in developingcountries continues at a high level with background feature material pre-dominating. It was noted with gratification that the popular, tabloid, newspapers(national and provincial) carried more items on development in 1973 thanpreviously, with world shortages of food and raw materials, the populationprospects and the range of ecological questions providing an exciting quarryfor feature writers.97. The ODA (as it was) issued 230 Press releases during the year, some infeature form. A 28-minute technicolour film, commissioned by ODA, aboutdevelopment in India was given its premiere at the National Film Theatre inLondon. Copies have been made available free of charge, and borrowedand shown many times; the film is part of the regular programme at theCommonwealth Institute Cinema which is attended by thousands of schoolchildren and students. Throughout the year a 600-square foot travellingexhibition on development was mounted in cities throughout the British Isles.Over 30,000 copies of a new wallet containing notes and illustrated sheetson development were distributed to schools, organisations and individuals.ODA staff made themselves available on a voluntary basis to fulfil manyspeaking engagements during the year.98. There were four debates in Parliament in which the subjects of aidand development were fully discussed. As noted in paragraph 4 above, theall-party Parliamentary Select Committee on Overseas Development producedits report in July 1973 on EEC development policies. Committee membersalso travelled abroad but did not publish a further report before the Session
was terminated by the General Election. Throughout the year there were asubstantial number of Parliamentary Questions, on aid and related matters.Information Work by the Voluntary Agencies99. Apart from their fund-raising activities (see paragraphs 81-82 above)but also as part of these activities the voluntary agencies have themselvescarried out extensive educational work directly to the schools and to adultgroups of all sorts which is not confined to describing their own overseasactivities. They have helped in a most useful way to paint a picture of themany problems in the developing countries and so to encourage public supportfor official assistance. The work of these agencies and of the churchescontinues to provide active supporters for more politically oriented campaignsfor trade and aid policies more helpful to the developing countries and ofCourse for a larger volume of aid. Most notably in the past year has beenthe extensive work of the World Development Movement whose educationalcampaign in towns and cities all over the country has been backed by a massivesign-in campaign addressed to Members of Parliament. Over 400 membershave received petitioners and petitions with a total of about half a millionsignatures.100. The Voluntary Committee on Overseas Aid and Developmentcontinues to under-pin much of the educational work by serving as a basicresource centre, with communications extending throughout the school-university system of the country and serving also other groups, in particularthose joining in the Standing Conference on the Second Development Decade,referred to in paragraph 83 above.III.  THE FOOD PROBLEM OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIESA.  Promotion of Food Production in the Developing CountriesPolicy101. The United Kingdom recognises that the food problem in developingcountries is one for considerable concern, and that the improvement of thesituation depends mainly on increased production in those countries. Theneed for more assistance is certainly acknowledged but it is essential thatthis be accompanied by a real commitment by the governments of developingcountries to a programme of increased food production through agriculturaldevelopment. Implicit in any such programme is the need for productionplanning, conducive price policies, development of storage facilities forstockholding, attention to storage problems and attention to marketing systems.The United Kingdom is in a strong position to offer assistance in all theseactivities.102. In general, the aim of the United Kingdom&apos;s aid in the agriculturalsector, including fisheries and forestry, is to improve the quality and quantityof production, of both food and cash earning commodities. The UnitedKingdom&apos;s policies and programmes for developing countries tend more
and more to concentrate on the problem of bringing small farmers into thesystem of development. The precise form of these activities varies from countryto country having regard to the wide scale of development potential whichinvolves not only the quality of the natural resources available but also variouspolitical, social and economic factors. Further, action for small farmersrequires a specially adapted system of organisation and institutional patternwhich involves a wide range of essential activities such as modification ofland tenure practices, provision of credit under systems suitable for smallfarmers, extension systems devised expressly for small farmers, marketingorganisations designed for small farmers, etc. Every country has its ownunique balance of physical economic, social and political factors which makesuniversal generalisations about solutions counter productive.103. The United Kingdom has long paid special attention to agriculturaldevelopment, particularly in the least developed countries and has encourageddeveloping countries to give adequate emphasis in their development pro-grammes to the agricultural sector. Attempts are now being made to intensifythat concentration on development aid for food and agriculture.104. Major improvements have been made through research in a numberof very important ways, e.g. improved crop plants maize, wheat, rice. Newwork is also being developed on other crops such as sorghum, millet, pigeonpea, chickpea (at ICRISAT), cassava (at CIAT). New techniques for farmingare also being studied. Control of crop plant and animal diseases also showsgreat progress.105. A major difficulty is getting this new knowledge adopted by farmers.The United Kingdom is willing to help with this, and though there have beensome successes, the fact remains that help can only be given if the governmentsrequest it and may indeed only be effective if the farmers themselves want it.The small farmer has benefited in many places but for the reasons given theimpact has not been as great as it could have been.Capital Aid106. The United KingdonVs capital aid is made up of bilateral loansand grants and multilateral grants to international organisations. It is notpossible to give an exact figure for the amount spent on agriculture owing tothe problems of defining in absolute terms this wide subject. However, aidable to be identified in this sector amounted to $16m. ( 6m.) in 1972 and$21m. ( 9m.) in 1973.Technical Assistance107. During 1972 and 1973 there were respectively 1,263 and 1,227British experts serving in the developing countries under the aid programmein posts relating to agriculture and natural resources. In addition, during thesame periods there were respectively 240 and 232 volunteers engaged in agriculturein developing countries under the British Volunteer Programme which ismostly financed out of the aid programme.
Consultancies108. The services of firms of British consultants are engaged undertechnical assistance programmes to carry out surveys and studies in theagricultural and natural resources sector.  In 1973 these included:(a) team to assist small scale irrigation schemes in Ethiopia;(b) further advice on proposed fertiliser complex in India;(c) assistance to fishing industries in Ghana, Mauritius, the Philippines: and St. Helena;id) soil survey of Niger Valley, Nigeria;(e) team to assist and train Design Unit of East Java Irrigation Service;(/) further studies on development of water supplies on Mauritius includingsub-island of Rodrigues;(g) assistance to sugar industries in Bolivia, Indonesia, Mauritius andSt. Kitts.Training109. Training facilities are provided under the technical assistanceprogramme dealing with all aspects of agricultural production of both cropsand livestock products, crop protection and storage, animal health, forestry,agricultural extension, fisheries, economics, marketing and co-operativeactivities. In 1972 and 1973 there were respectively 882 and 792 studentsand trainees from developing countries studying agriculture and naturalresources in the United Kingdom under the aid programme.Research ,110. Bilateral assistance for agricultural research is concentrated onspecific problem-solving projects. These projects are carried out both overseasand in the United Kingdom and encompass most of the scientific disciplinesin agriculture. International agricultural research is supported by the UnitedKingdom giving grants to several international research institutes; theirprogrammes are co-ordinated by the Consultative Group for InternationalAgricultural Research. The United Kingdom is a member of the Group. Anumber of home-based scientific units concerned with agricultural problemsof developing countries are also maintained or assisted by the aid programme.Details of the work of these units is given in paragraphs 56-65 above.Fertilisers111. The present world shortage of fertilisers is a serious constraint toagricultural development. The long-term remedy is through increasedproduction but there is no simple solution to the short-term problem. Financialaid. intended for fertiliser purchase would be counter-productive in that itwould merely push up price levels without increasing the fertiliser suppliesavailable. The United Kingdom is not opposed in principle to the use of aidfor fertiliser, indeed aid has been provided for the purchase of fertilisers inthe past, and the United Kingdom contributes to the FAO/FFHC FertiliserProgramme. There seems little purpose, however, in providing more aidfor the purchase of fertiliser until the supply position has considerablyimproved.
112. The basic problem, shortage of supply, applies as much to theUnited Kingdom as to the developing countries. The British industry willhave difficulty in meeting domestic need over the next two years. It followstherefore that the United Kingdom is not in a very good position to helpdeveloping countries in the form of direct aid for fertilisers, although it isrecognised that a case can be made for some diversion of fertilisers fromdeveloped countries to the developing countries on the grounds of the greaterphysical response to fertilisers in many parts of the developing world. TheUnited Kingdom will therefore make every effort to utilise its fertiliser capacityto the full and, while recognising the great difficulties, will contribute as muchas possible towards helping to meet the existing demand from LDCs.113. The United Kingdom is also alert to any requests for technicalassistance to help in the short term to increase the utilisation of existing plantin the LDCs as well as to requests which can be accommodated within the aidframework for capital aid for the establishment of additional fertiliser productioncapacity. In 1971-72 $60m. ( 25m.) was committed towards the constructionof three fertiliser plants in India and two of them are due to be completedwithin the next six months. $16m. ( 6-7m.) was also committed for a similarproject in Turkey.B.  Food AidPolicy114. In general the United Kingdom is unenthusiastic about the idea ofgiving food aid as a contribution to overseas development. A major reason,especially relevant to the British situation, is that food aid is not additionalbut is an alternative to other, and in the view of the United Kingdom, inherentlypreferable forms of aid. There are a number of other reasons. Firstly, as anet food importer the United Kingdom does not have surplus food availablefor disposal and it is considered that a use of aid funds more suitable to thecircumstances of the United Kingdom as well as more beneficial to overseasdeyelopment, is to spend them to stimulate agricultural production in developingcountries through providing capital aid or technical assistance. Secondly,food aid can, and often does have adverse effects on food production and thedistribution of income between rural and urban areas in the recipient countries.Most bilateral food aid is sold on the domestic market of the recipient countrybut such sales do depress prices within these countries, and hence transferincome from food producers to food purchasers, weakening the incentive toproduce food and adding to the other symptoms of rural-urban imbalance.Thirdly, food aid is essentially tied to a particular commodity. Comparedwith other forms of aid, it represents a sharp reduction in the range of choiceopen to the recipient; aid in the form of free foreign exchange can be used topurchase anything including food, and even conventional procurement tiedaid still leaves a choice from all the goods produced in a particular country,and frees other foreign exchange for the purpose of buying conventionalfoods from conventional suppliers. Food aid not only restricts the choiceto food, but often to particular types of food. Fourthly, in addition to theadverse effects on producers, there may be adverse effects on governmentpolicy, if governments come to rely on the availability of food aid and canafford to lower the priority accorded to increasing domestic output. Fifthly,
a possible disadvantage of food aid, though perhaps a less serious one, isthat it may change tastes in such a way that imported food is demanded- instead of local food which would adequately supply nutritional needs. Ifthe demand for the new foods require their importation in any quantity itcould place an unwelcome burden on the country&apos;s limited foreign exchangeresources.115. The United Kingdom recognises that a different situation exists inrelation to emergency food aid, and that for humanitarian reasons it is essentialto meet shortfalls arising from natural and man-made disasters. As a netfood importer the United Kingdom is unable to provide food from its ownresources but considerable financial support has been given to rescue pro-grames, both multilaterally and bilaterally, and essential air and land transporthas been provided on a bilateral basis.116. As the United Kingdom is a net importer of food the question ofproducing excess supplies for food aid has not arisen, and such stocks as haveexisted have been the minimum required for normal commercial throughput,i.e. sufficient normally for only a few weeks.World Food Programme117. In spite of our general attitude on food we nevertheless considerthat the WFP has a useful role to play in development, and its administrationis such that most of the adverse effects present in other food aid programmesare eliminated. The United Kingdom has supported the WFP since itsinception. The United Kingdom&apos;s pledges for the calendar biennia 1971-72and 1973-74 were $3-67m. ( l-53m.) and $6m. ( 2-5m.) respectively. Forthe 1975-76 biennium the United Kingdom has promised a total of $7-98m.,( 3-325m.). The reasons for this favourable attitude to the WFP are thatit is a genuinely multilateral organisation and so a very proper channel forpart of the United Kingdom contribution to multilateral development work.Since its inception the WFP has gained considerable experience in thedistribution of food aid and the United Kingdom is a strong advocate ofgreater use being made of the WFP&apos;s experience and organisation by morefood aid, currently being provided on a bilateral basis, being channelled throughthe Programme.118. The United Kingdom found itself obliged, on accession to the EEC,to take part in the Community&apos;s food aid programmes both in cereals underthe Food Aid Convention 1971 and in other commodities not covered by aninternational agreement. Whilst the general United Kingdom attitude tofood aid remains as in paragraphs 114-116 above, it recognises that, in thepresent food supply situation, there will be a need for food aid in the nextfew years; and this is why the United Kingdom has agreed to a one-yearextension of the 1971 Food Aid Convention to 30 June, 1975, and to thecontinuation of that and other EEC food aid programmes at about existinglevels.Food Aid Convention and other Food Programmes119. Apart from its regular pledges of food and cash resources to theWFP mentioned above, the United Kingdom, as part of its obligation for thethird harvest year 1970-71 of the 1967 Convention, paid for 79,089 tonnes
of wheat to be used by the WFP in 1971 and 1972. The cost of the wheatwas $4-2m. ( 1 -75m.) and the accompanying distribution costs amounted to afurther $0-96m. ( 0-4m.). Further commitments for the WFP under theprogrammes for the harvest years 1972-73 and 1973-74 are estimated (includingthe cash contribution) at $2-4m. ( 1-Om.) and $5-0m. ( 2-lm.) respectively.120. The tables at the end of this Memorandum show bilateral comrtiit-ments and gross disbursements for each of the years 1971, 1972 and 1973. Allbut a small gift to Senegal of 100 tonnes of wheat flour in 1972-73 was infulfilment of FAC obligations. The tables show quite clearly the effect ofthe United Kingdom withdrawal from the Second (1971) Convention and ofits readherence since the United Kingdom became a Member State of the EECin January 1973. It was not possible to complete all the commitments underthe 1972-73 harvest year programme in the calendar year 1973, and, whilstsome shipments were made the necessary payments procedures were notcomplete for any of those commitments by 31 December, 1973. It is estimatedthat the total cost will amount to $9 - 84m. ( 4 - lm.) and that the cost of bilateralactions under the 1973-74 harvest year programme will be $16-8m. ( 7-0m.).121. Multilaterally the United Kingdom played its part in EEC food aidfinanced from the EEC Budget to which the Member States contribute annually.In 1973 the EEC sent as food aid cereals, milk powder, butteroil, sugar and eggs.The total value of this food aid disbursed in 1973 is $123-0m. ( 50-2m.) whichwill cost the United Kingdom $10-8m. ( 4-4m.). The United Kingdomcost in 1974 will be higher due to rising prices and a rise in our Budget liability-the present estimate is some $13-2m. ( 5-5m.). Of the $10-8m. ( 4-4m.)spent in 1973, $2-6m. ( 1 - lm.) were for cereals under the Food Aid Conventionand the remainder for other products referred to above. EEC multilateralcommitments in 1973 totalled some $172-0m. ( 71-4m.) and the cost of thesecommitments to the United Kingdom over the whole period of disbursementwill be something in excess of $15-lm. ( 6-3m.) depending on how fastdisbursement takes place.Ministry of Overseas Development,London, S.W.1
