REFERENDUM ON UNITED KINGDOMMEMBERSHD? OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITYPREFACEThis White Paper is about the organisation of the national referendum onthe United Kingdom&apos;s membership of the European Community.The referendum is to be held because of the unique nature of the issue,which has fundamental implications for the future of this country, for thepolitical relationship between the United Kingdom and the other member governments of the Community, and for the constitutional position ofParliament.The organisation of the referendum must be efficient and fair. some special arrangements will be necessary, as set out in this White Paper. Butwherever appropriate, the Government will use the well-tried machinery which serves for Parliamentary elections. Thus advantage will be taken ofprocedures and safeguards which long experience has shown to be effective and which are familiar to the voters.The political parties represented in Parliament and leading organisationscampaigning both for continued membership and for our leaving the Com-munity have been consulted. The experience of other countries has also beenconsidered. The Government will pay careful attention to reaction to this white Paper both in Parliament and outside.
1. introduction. On 23 January the Prime Minister announced to the House ofCommons that, once the outcome of the renegotiation of the terms of membership was known, a referendum would be held on whether the UnitedKingdom should continue as a member of the European Community or should withdraw. (The full statement is at Annex A.)2. When the outcome of renegotiation is known the Government will decide upon their own recommendation to the country, whether for con-tinued membership of the Community on the basis of the renegotiatedterms or for withdrawal. The present White Paper is concerned only withthe organisation of the referendum ie the organisation of the poll, the pro-vision of information to the voters and the scope of the legislation required.3. The Government have studied the experience of other countries, withparticular reference to those such as Australia and New Zealand with political systems closely related to ours and to the referenda on entry intothe European Community held by Denmark, the Republic of Ireland and norway in 1972. (Annex B summarises the practice in a number of countries.)4. The period of further uncertainty over our membership of the Com-munity should be kept as short as possible in our own interests and those ofother Community Governments. In his statement on 23 January the PrimeMinister said &quot;Provided the outcome of renegotiation is known in time, we intend to hold the referendum before the summer holidays, which means inpractice not later than the end of June&quot;. He went on to say that the Govern-ment proposed to introduce the necessary legislation around Easter-time witha view to securing Royal Assent before the end of May. If the referendumis to be held before the summer holidays, it will be essential to complete the renegotiation and to prepare and enact legislation in accordance with thattimetable.2.  THE POLL AND THE QUESTION5. The Governmenfs general approach to the organisation of the reference--dum is that the familiar procedures and practices applied to normal UnitedKingdom elections should be used as far as possible. The same approachapplies to the more general questions of the size of the poll and of the majorityrequired to provide a decisive result; these are discussed below.Size of Poll and Majority6. The Government have agreed to be bound by the verdict of the british people, as expressed in the referendum result. They have considered whether that result should be subject to any special conditions in terms of the size of the poll or the extent of the majority.7. It may be argued that a verdict of such importance should not depend ona simple majority theoretically a single vote in an electorate of 40 million.
A poll of a minimum size might be specified. Alternatively it might be laiddown that the number of votes cast or the number composing the majorityshould exceed a specified proportion of the total electorate. Some countries have applied conditions of this kind to their referenda, although they are usually intended to make it impossible for constitutional changes to beintroduced too easily or by a minority of the electorate.8. The Government are concerned that the size of the poll should be adequate, and they are confident that it will be so. They also consider itto be of great importance that the verdict of the poll should be clear andconclusive. In the circumstances they believe that it will be best to follow the normal electoral practice and accept that the referendum result should rest on a simple majority without qualifications or conditions of any kind.The Question on the Ballot Paper9. It has been suggested that more than one question should be posedon the ballot paper, and that the questions should include one asking if thevoters would prefer to leave the issue to Parliament. But the Prime minister has made it clear on several occasions that the referendum will ask for a simple &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to a single straight-forward question about staying inor leaving the Community in the light of the renegotiated terms of member-ship, and the Government believe that the advantage lies with simplicity. Thequestion will be embodied in the Referendum Bill itself and will therefore be approved by Parliament.10. Some argue that the precise wording of the question can have a significant effect upon the result. Although there is no reliable evidence to support, this view, the Government will seek to ensure that the words onthe ballot paper are as free from bias as possible. They are not yet committed to any form of words but following consultations with the political partiesrepresented in Parliament and the leading campaigning organisations they propose for discussion that the ballot paper should read as follows:The Government have announced the results of the renegotiationof the United Kingdom&apos;s terms of membership: of the european community.DO YOU THINK THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM SHOULDSTAY IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY?YESNOProvision will be made for bilingual ballot papers to be used at pollingstations in Wales.
11. This chapter deals with the electorate and the practical arrangementsfor holding the referendum; casting votes; counting them; and announcing the result.Electorate12. In the Governmenfs view the electorate should include those on thecurrent Parliamentary election register which came into force earlier thismonth, together with peers (who are registered for local government elec-tions but cannot vote in Parliamentary elections).Responsibility for local conduct of die Poll13. There are some differences in the electoral arrangements for variouspurposes in different parts of the United Kingdom. For the referendum theGovernment have concluded that the most satisfactory administrativearrangement will be to place the responsibility for polling arrangements (otherthan counting votes) in England and Wales on the returning officers fordistrict council and London borough elections, in Scotland on the returning officers for regional and islands area authority elections and in NorthernIreland on the Chief Electoral Officer.Absent Voting14. The Government propose to ensure that the postal and proxy votingfacilities which are available for general elections are also available for the referendum poll. Special steps will be taken to advertise these facilities, andit is hoped that those eligible for absent votes who are not already registeredf or them will apply now in order to reduce the burden on those who will beorganising the physical arrangements for the poll.Poll Cards15. Poll cards are not an indispensible part of the electoral procedurebut they serve a useful purpose. They remind the elector of his right to vote and they tell him his voting number and where his polling station is. It ishoped that poll cards can be produced in time for the referendum poll, butthis turns on the availability of materials and technical factors which arebeing explored.Polling16. Polling will be in the normal way. From 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on theappointed day voters will go to the local polling stations, which will be those used for general elections. They will receive a ballot paper from the presidingofficer; enter a booth; mark the paper in one of two clearly marked places;and put it, folded, into the ballot box.Independent scrutiny17.   The absence of any candidates or their election or polling agents will
leave the referendum without an important element of the ordinary electoralmachinery unless some other provision is made. Candidates and their agentsare specifically afforded access to the various stages in the procedure atwhich ballot papers are handled the despatch and opening of postal votes,the casting of votes in polling stations and the count. The Government are considering to what extent the presence of independent observers would be appropriate and useful at the equivalent stages in the referendum poll.Counting the votes and announcing the result18. The votes cast at local polling stations and sealed into ballot boxesthere can be counted at various levels. These divide broadly into a choice between a central count and a variety of methods of counting locally.19. It would be practicable to arrange for the votes to be counted, as theyare in local and Parliamentary elections, by local government district and london borough or by Parliamentary constituency. This arrangement wouldhave advantages of speed, familiarity and economy. It would also be possibleto arrange for the count to be organised by counties.20. To arrange for all votes cast in the United Kingdom to be countedcentrally would involve the creation of new machinery and would clearly bea major administrative task, involving the transport of ballot boxes frompolling stations to the counting centre. The count itself is likely to require atleast five working days, including polling day.21. In considering these alternatives the Government have attached par-ticular weight to the character of the referendum as a national poll on anational issue, organised to secure the verdict of the whole British people.The constituency is the whole of the United Kingdom. In this respect the referendum will be fundamentally different from a General Election in which individual members of Parliament are elected by individual constituencies.The Government have taken full account of the views of those who believethat the voting pattern of the different parts of the United Kingdom shouldbe made known. But they believe that the most appropriate arrangement inthe special circumstances of the referendum will be to count all the votescast centrally and to make a single declaration of the United Kingdom result.To announce the result in this way will secure its widest acceptance by theBritish people.22. Detailed arrangements for a central count are now being planned. Thepossibility is being considered of using any mechanical processes which maybe of assistance, although a manual count is judged likely to prove the mostreliable arrangement. One centre in London may be used for the count inthe interests of security and economy of organisation.23. A national returning officer will be appointed in due course. He willbe responsible for the arrangements for counting the votes and certifying theresult of the referendum which will be reported to Parliament by the PrimeMinister.
4.  INFORMATION ACTIVITIES24. This chapter is concerned with all aspects of the provision of informa-tion to voters. It is divided into two sections, one dealing with Governmentactivities, the other with the activities of outside organisations and individuals.GOVERNMENT INFORMATION ACTIVITIES25. The Government have given careful consideration to the part theyshould play in providing information to the public about the issue of con-tinued membership of the European Community and about the referendumitself. The question of membership has been debated many times in the last15 years and a massive Government information campaign would be in-appropriate. The campaigning organisations, the press, radio and televisioncan all be expected to provide an ample supply of information about theCommunity.26. The Government will however ensure that the outcome of the renegotiation and their own recommendation whether to stay in the Com-munity or not are explained fully to the voters by the publication of a white paper (which will be debated in Parliament) and of a popular versioncontaining a less technical account of the renegotiated terms and the government&apos;s recommendation.27. The referendum itself will be unfamiliar to the public and theGovernment will take appropriate steps to publicise the date of the poll andthe procedures for voting. .28. The Government will accordingly arrange for the delivery to everyhousehold of the popular version of the White Paper and an explanation of the way in which the referendum will be conducted.29. A large number of bodies will be engaged in the campaign and theGovernment have explored the possibility of ensuring that a clear statementof both sides of the case is readily available to the voters. In parliamentary elections a basic form of information is the &quot;election address&quot; issued bycandidates. It would be appropriate to ensure that something analogous isprovided for the referendum.30. In the Governmenfs view the best way of achieving this would beto deliver to every household at public expense (at the same time as the separate document described in paragraph 28) a single document containing a statement of between 1,000 and 2,000 words of each of the opposing views,together with answers given by each side to the same sets of questions. this document would best be prepared by representatives of the main campaigningorganisations representing the two points of view.31. It is to be expected that there will be a substantial additional flow of requests to the Government for factual information, interpretation of the re-negotiated terms and the like from the press, radio, television and interestedorganisations and individuals. The Government therefore propose to establishfor the period before the poll a special information unit to deal with suchrequests.
INFORMATION ACTIVITIES OF OUTSIDE BODIES32. The Government have considered whether any special arrangements are needed either to limit or to assist activities by outside bodies and individuals designed to inform the public of their views on the issues involvedin the referendum. Little assistance can be derived from the precedent ofParliamentary elections in which the main control is on any expendituredesigned to secure the election of a particular candidate. Expenditure by, forexample, the national party organisations, which cannot be related to the campaign of any particular candidate, is uncontrolled. The Governmentapproach this difficult area with no desire to limit traditional freedom of speech but rather with a desire to see that both sides of the case are knownto the public and that public interest in the issues is stimulated.Television and Radio33. The Government are confident that the IBA and BBC will exerciseeditorial discretion designed to ensure that there is a fair balance between the opposing views in news and feature programmes. The broadcasting authori-ties may also decide to run a series of short &quot;referendum broadcasts.&quot; In thisway an equal number of short periods of broadcasting time would be madeavailable to the two main campaigning organisations in the two or threeweeks before polling day. The Government would welcome such an initiative.34. The television programme companies of the IBA are forbidden by statute from accepting political advertising. This prohibition applies also to independent local radio.Other Activities35. There is concern that the organisations favouring one course willhave greater resources than those favouring another. It is already clear thatany such imbalance, if it exists, is not preventing both sides from obtainingwide coverage of their views. The Government are convinced that anyattempt to limit total expenditure by the two sides would be impracticable not least because it could apply only after legislation had received royal assent.36. The Government believe however that it is a matter of legitimatepublic interest to know how much money has been spent on the campaignby major organisations and interests and the sources of their income. Al-though this can be known only after the event, it could exercise a restraininginfluence. The Government are therefore considering how far it is possibleto require that this information should be disclosed.37. Careful consideration has been given to the possibility of banningor limiting certain activities in order to ensure fair play. The government consider that restrictions and requirements which apply to the conduct of ageneral election campaign should as far as practicable apply to the reference--dum; these will include, for example, a ban on the employment of paidcanvassers and a requirement that all campaign literature, posters etc should bear the name and address of the sponsoring organisations.
38. It has been suggested that any adverse effect there might be on thebalance of the campaign if one side had more resources than the other couldbe substantially reduced by a ban on the publication by newspapers of paidcampaign advertisements, except those necessary to publicise campaignmeetings. The Governmenfs view is that such a ban would be an unaccepta-ble restriction on a normal freedom and that it might have an adverse effecton the impact of the campaign and on the number of people who decide to vote.39. Employers may seek to influence the views of their employees andtrade unions the views of their members by warning them in their place ofwork of the dangers to their jobs of one outcome or another of the referendum.The Government do not believe that the control of such activities by employers or trade unions is an appropriate subject for legislation but hope that none ofthose concerned will engage in campaigning activities that might be damaging to industrial relations.Assistance from Public Funds40. The Government have received representations that a fair and effective referendum requires assistance from public funds to the campaigningorganisations. This would require statutory authority. The Government areprepared to consider providing limited financial assistance, to be equallydivided between the two sides, if it is possible to identify two organisations which adequately represent those campaigning for and against continued membership of the Community.5.  LEGISLATION41. In his statement on 23 January the Prime Minister announced thatthe Government proposed to introduce legislation at Easter-time to providefor the holding of the referendum. v42. The legislation will need to make specific provision for various matters which will apply uniquely to the referendum and to adapt theexisting electoral machinery as necessary. The Government propose that theBill itself should authorise the holding of the referendum and includemachinery for the determination of the date. It will specify the wording ofthe question. It will include provision for the appointment of some person to have overall responsibility for counting the votes and announcing theresult. It will make appropriate financial provision in connection with the holding of the referendum. It will also include the power to adapt theexisting machinery by Order. Because of its importance, the committee stage of the Bill will be taken on the Floor of the House of Commons.43. The Order will be made as soon as possible after the Bill has receivedRoyal Assent. A draft will be published at the time the Bill is introduced orvery soon afterwards. This will enable the Bill to be debated against the background of specific proposals relating to the machinery. The contents of the Order will be technical and seem likely to be uncontroversial. TheGovernment will however take account of any views on matters of detailexpressed during the debates on the Bill.
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER ON JANUARY 23 1975Mr. Speaker, I will, with permission, make a statement about the means by which the British people will decide the issue of our membership of theEuropean Community.It is the declared policy of the Government that, once the outcome ofour renegotiation of the terms of membership is known, the British people should have the right to decide, through the ballot box, by means either of a General Election or of a referendum, whether Britain should continue in membership of the European Community or should withdraw.The Government have decided that this should be done by means of a referendum.Prolonged uncertainty and delay on the decision of the British people are in the interests neither of Britain nor of other members of the Com-munity. After 15 years of discussion and negotiation, it is an issue whichall of us in this House and in the country want to see settled; and uncertainty about the future of British membership is inhibiting the work of the Com-munity. The Government are committed to putting the issue to the peoplebefore 10th October this year. Provided that the outcome of renegotiationis known in time, we intend to hold the referendum before the summerholidays, which means in practice not later than the end of June. We shall,therefore, propose to the House arrangements which would make it possibleto hold the referendum on that timetable, tight though it will be.When the outcome of renegotiation is known, the Government will decideupon their own recommendation to the country, whether for continued membership of the Community on the basis of the renegotiated terms, orfor withdrawal, and will announce their decision to the House in due course.That announcement will provide an opportunity for the House to debate the question of substance. That does not, of course, preclude debates atany earlier time, subject to the convenience of the House.The circumstances of this referendum are unique, and the issue to bedecided is one on which strong views have long been held which cross partylines. The Cabinet has, therefore, decided that if, when the time comes, thereare members of the Government, including members of the Cabinet, who do not feel able to accept and support the Government^ recommendation,whatever it may be, they will, once the recommendation has been announced,be free to support and speak in favour of a different conclusion in the referendum campaign.As to the arrangements for the referendum, I told the House on Tuesdaythat the rules for the test of public opinion must be made by this House.The Government propose within a very few weeks to publish a White paper on the rules and arrangements for conducting the referendum. The white paper will set out the various possible courses on each issue and the Govern-menfs proposals on such matters as, for example, the information policy
of the Government during the referendum campaign, broadcasting arrange-ments during the campaign, the question of expenditure by campaigninggroups, the form in which the question is to be put to the British people,and arrangements for conducting the poll, the counting of the votes and theannouncement of the result.The Government will provide time for a debate on the White Paper onreferendum procedure in this House before the Easter recess. That debatewill, of course, be separate from, and will precede, the parliamentary debatewhich will be necessary on the outcome of the negotiations. The debate onthe referendum White Paper will enable the Government to take full accountof the views expressed by right hon. and hon. Members of this House, andby public opinion generally, in drafting the necessary legislation for the referendum.The Government propose to introduce the legislation around Easter-time.We shall, of course, propose that all stages should be taken on the Floor ofthe House. If we are to be able to hold the referendum before the summerholiday, the Bill will need to complete its passage through both Houses andto receive Royal Assent by the end of May.
ANNEX BREFERENDA IN SOME FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTHCOUNTRIESAustraliaReferenda are held to amend the Australian (Federal) Constitution and certain provisions of some State Constitutions. Occasionally they are also held to obtainthe views of the electorate on politically sensitive issues. In outline, proposedalterations to the Federal Constitution are usually submitted to a referendumonce passed by an absolute majority of each House of Parliament. In certaincircumstances, a proposed alteration can also be submitted to a referendum ifpassed on two separate occasions by only one House in the event of a disagree-ment between the two Houses.The Chief Electoral Officer arranges for the distribution of a pamphlet to every elector, showing the proposed constitutional alteration(s) together withthe arguments for and against. Each argument is limited to 2,000 words andis authorised by a majority of its supporters in both Houses. Campaign expenses,including the cost of publishing referendum material, incurred by persons,political parties or other organised bodies must be shown on returns submittedafter the referendum. Returns are also submitted by newspaper proprietors, show-ing names and addresses of those inserting referendum material and amountspaid or outstanding. All returns are open to public inspection. There are noceilings on expenditure but Parliament is at present considering a proposal to limit the referendum expenses of political parties. The total cost to the Govern-ment of the two referenda held in December11973 (on prices and incomes) wasabout $3 million ( 1.9m at then current rates of exchange), for a population of13 million, of which some $700,000 ( 450,000) was spent on the preparation and distribution of pamphlets.The ballot-paper specifies the title or titles of each proposed alteration and provides for a Yes or No answer to a question asking whether the voter approvesof the proposed alteration(s). Voting is compulsory. Ample provision is made forpostal and absent voting. ,A proposed constitutional alteration must be approved by a majority of votersin the nation as a whole and also by a majority of voters in a majority of the six Australian States (electors in Australian territories are not eligible to voteat referenda to alter the Constitution). A proposed alteration may fail even thoughapproved by an overall majority of voters. Special provisions exist to safeguard the position of the States on proposed alterations to the Constitution seeking to alter matters such as the representation of the States in Parliament or an altera-tion of State boundaries. Of 32 constitutional amendments submitted to refer-endum since federation in 1901, only 5 have been approved. The initial countis carried out in the Federal electoral divisions of each State and the resultsof the referendum are collated and published by the Chief Electoral Officer. Theresults show the number of valid votes cast for and against the proposed altera-tion in each State and in Australia. The number of informal ballot papers isalso shown.DenmarkUnder Article 42 of the Constitution, Bills passed by the Folketing (Parliament)
may be put to a referendum at the request of one-third of its members. CertainBills are exempt, eg on finance or taxation or Bills introduced for the purpose ofdischarging existing Treaty obligations. Under Article 20 of the Constitution, legis-lation involving surrender to an international body of powers vested in the authori-ties of the Realm is submitted to a referendum, unless supported by five-sixthsof the Members of the Folketing. Constitutional amendments are subject toReferendum under Article 88. Seven referenda have been held since 1953.For the e.c. Referendum, held under Article 20 on 2 October 1972, theGovernment and the Folketing undertook an intensive educational campaign. TheGovernment issued twelve booklets on Community institutions and policies to-gether with a compendium of 136 questions raised by the public and answeredby a panel of Government experts. The Folketing issued a 16-page broadsheetwhich was distributed to every household containing articles for and againstDanish membership and official statements by the nine major political parties.Government funds, managed by the Ministry of Education according to a strictlydefined formula, were made available to parties and organisations involved inthe information campaign; the total amount of public money spent being approxi-mately  1.4m for a population of 5 million.In 1972 the Danish electorate was asked to approve the draft law enablingDenmark to become a member of the European Communities by answeringeither Yes or No, as required by the Electoral Law. Facilities exist for postal andabsentee voting.A Draft Law put to referendum is deemed to have been rejected if amajority of those voting vote against it and if the Noes comprise at least 30 percent, of those entitled to vote. As in elections, referenda results are declaredfor each individual polling station, of which there are several in each constituency.The total poll in the e.c. Referendum was 90 per cent.: 63.3 per cent, of the votes were in favour, 36.7 per cent, were against.FranceUnder Article 3 of the Constitution, national sovereignty belongs to thepeople, who exercise it through their elected representatives or by referendum.Under Article 11, the President, on the proposal of the Government when Parlia-ment is in session, or of the two Assemblies jointly, may submit to referendumany Government bill dealing with specified subjects. These include ratification of a Treaty which, although not in conflict with the Constitution, would affectthe workings of public institutions. A special provision exists under Article 89on amendments to the Constitution, where the initiative belongs jointly to thePresident on the proposal of the Prime Minister and to Members of Parliament:the proposal must be voted by both Houses in identical terms after which thePresident may choose to submit it to a referendum which is binding. On two occasions, however, constitutional amendments have been taken under Article 11rather than Article 89.Normal voting procedures apply to referenda, and all political parties enjoy the same propaganda facilities (television, radio, etc.) as in elections. Before the1972 referendum on enlargement of the European Communities, each voter was sent, together with his ballot papers, an explanatory text containing a declara-tion by the President, the question to be set in the referendum, the decreesubmitting the Bill authorising the ratification of the Treaty of Accession to a referendum, the text of the Bill itself, the text of the Treaty of Accession, anda resume of its annexes (complete texts of which were available in town halls).
Referendum questions are always put to the voters in the following form: &quot;Doyou approve of the Bill submitted to the French people by the President of theRepublic and concerning ....?&quot; The result is decided by a simple majorityof votes cast, and facilities for postal and proxy voting are available.Votes are counted by polling stations and are announced for each departementand for the nation as a whole; from these the figures for each parliamentaryconstituency may be deduced. Published results include the number of eligiblevoters, of valid votes cast, and of yes and no votes. From these figures the numberof abstentions and of blank or spoiled votes can also be deduced.italy the Constitution provides, under Article 138, for referenda on constitutionallaws or amendments to the Constitution. These must be requested within threemonths of the publication of the laws or amendments by one-fifth of the membersof either Chamber or not less than 500,000 electors or five regional councils.Under Article 75, the two last may also call a referendum for the partial ortotal abrogation of existing legislation, except fiscal and budget laws, pardonsand amnesties and laws authorising the ratification of international treaties. a referendum cannot be held on a constitutional law which has been approvedduring a second reading by two-thirds of the members of each Chamber.Referenda on the abrogation of legislation may not be held outside the Parlia-mentary session or in the first year of Parliaments life.The publicity campaign begins formally thirty days before polling day. the promoters of the referendum (recognised as one group only) and Parliamentaryparties are entitled to the same facilities as parties participating in an electoralcampaign. No ceilings are imposed on campaign (expenditure and the State bearsthe administrative cost. The Italian Parliament voted approximately  20m forthe 1974 Divorce referendum, for a population of 55 million.The question put is formulated differently according to whether the reference--dum is on a constitutional question or the abrogation of legislation, but bothrequire only a Yes or No answer. The issue is decided by a simple majorityof valid votes providing that a majority of the electorate has voted. There isno postal vote in Italy.Votes are counted by constituencies, and the result is declared by the central office for the Referendum, which states whether the law concerned has receiveda greater number of valid affirmative or negative votes. In the 1974 referendumon the Divorce Law, results were available down to commune level.New ZealandNew Zealand subscribes to the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty but,under Article 189 of the Electoral Act of 1956, certain provisions of that Actmay only be amended by a 75 per cent, majority of the House of Representativesor by referendum. From time to time referenda have also been held on popularissues, as in 1949 when the electorate was consulted on licensing hours, bettingregulations and conscription.Only two referenda have been held since the Electoral Act of 1956. In the double referendum held in September 1967 a proposal to extend the Parlia-mentary term was put to the electorate as required by the 1956 Act, togetherwith a popular issue, the extension of licensing hours. Both were conducted in
accordance with the 1956 Act, as further defined by special Enabling Acts ofJuly 1967. The Government undertook an official information campaign outlining the alternatives and their implications. No rules of conduct or limits on expen-diture were imposed on campaigners.The ballot forms required voters to strike out one of two alternative proposals and the results were decided by the majority of valid votes cast. Facilities wereavailable for postal and absent voting.Votes were counted locally. Although in both cases the national figure onlywas decisive, the Sale of Liquor Poll Act 1967 specified publication of the totalnumber of valid votes for each electoral district, and voting figures for and against the proposed extension of the Parliamentary term were also published in this way.NorwayThe Constitution does not provide for referenda but five have so far beenheld by means of enabling legislation: on union with Sweden, the Monarchy,prohibition (two) and on membership of the e.c.. Since the first two referenda,which were binding on the Government, all others have been consultative. How-ever, the majority of the Storting (Parliament) agreed, without a vote, that theresult of the e.c. referendum, held on 24 and 25 September 1972, should be binding if a clear-cut majority emerged.In the e.c. Referendum the Government provided information in a white paper published in March 1972, a series of booklets on specialist topics availablefree of charge on application from June 1971, a general publication giving 100answers to questions on all relevant subjects and a telephone information service.Public funds were also allocated to the political parties in proportion to their parliamentary strength as in elections and to both pro- and anti-e.c. organisa-tions without conditions as to their use. The total cost to public funds was approximately  815,000 (at the rate of exchange then current) for a populationof under 4 million.The question put to the Norwegian electorate in 1972 was: &quot; Should Norwaybecome a member of the European Communities?&quot; The required answer wasYes or No. Voting facilities were available for those absent from their con-stituencies.Votes were counted in electoral districts and a simple majority was accepted.Voting figures were declared on a constituency basis and figures for invalid voteswere also available. The total poll for the e.c. referendum was 78 per cent.:46.5 per cent, of votes cast were for membership and 53.5 per cent, against.Republic of IrelandUnder Article 46 of the Constitution, a Bill amending the Constitution mustbe submitted to referendum after passing both Houses of Parliament. UnderArticle 27, a majority of the Upper House and not less than one-third of theLower House may also petition the President jointly for a referendum on aBill &quot; of national importance &quot;, but this procedure has not yet been used. The1972 referendum on membership of the e.c. was the.fourth of six referendaheld in Ireland.For the e.c. Referendum the Government issued a White Paper and pro-
duced several publications on the terms of entry and their implications, coveringpoints raised in detailed surveys of public attitudes. The cost of the officialcampaign was  45,000 for a population of just under 3 million. The three main political parties also produced leaflets in the form of an election address whichwere delivered post-free to each elector.The question put to the electorate in the e.c. referendum, in both officiallanguages and in the standard form under Article 46, was: &quot;Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the under-mentionedBill Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1971?&quot; The answer required was Yes or No. The Amendment in question, quoted in full on the officialpolling card, provided that the State might become a member of the european communities and that no provision of the Constitution would invalidate lawsetc. enacted by the State as a member of the Communities, or would preventCommunity laws etc. from having the force of law in the State.Referenda on constitutional amendments are decided by a simple majorityof electors taking part; postal voting is available only for the police and armed forces. Constituency results are counted and announced by local returning officers who report them to the Referendum Returning Officer in the Department ofLocal Government. He declares the formal result on the aggregate of all indi-vidual votes. The total poll in the e.c. Referendum was over 70 per cent.: 83per cent, of the votes were in favour, 17 per cent, were against.SwedenArticle 7:3 of the 1975 Constitution states: &quot;Provisions for an advisoryreferendum throughout the country shall be laid down in law.&quot; There is nostanding legislation. Three earlier referenda, on prohibition (1922), right-handdriving (1955) and social security (1957) were also advisory and their conductwas governed by special legislation in each case.In 1955 and 1957 the State financed its own neutral information campaign and no ceilings were set for total expenditure. In 1955 the question of right-handdriving was not a politically significant issue, and the pros and cons were putby two ad hoc committees established with government approval. The political parties were active in the ad hoc committees established in 1957, however, aswell as on their own behalf. One million kronor (approx.  69,000) were madeavailable to each side in 1955 and two million kronor (approx.  138,900) in 1957,for a population of 8 million.In 1955 the electorate were asked to vote Yes or No to the proposed intro-duction of right-hand driving, and in 1957 they were given the choice of threeproposals for pension schemes. On this occasion a blank vote was considered as a vote against all three, and the result was inconclusive.No majority requirements have been stipulated for referenda because oftheir advisory status, and the 1955 decision was reversed in 1967 without furtherrecourse to referendum. The voting procedure and count have been based onthe procedure in general elections, with postal and absent voting both permitted.Results have been published for constituencies and sub-constituencies as wellas for the whole of the country.SwitzerlandAt national level, all constitutional changes, and also certain international conventions, decided by the Legislature must be approved by national vote (the
so-called referendum obligatorium). Ordinary legislation may also be submittedto a national vote (referendum) at the request of not less than 30,000 votersor of eight cantons unless a decree is declared by the Federal Legislature to beurgent and therefore temporarily exempt. At the cantonal level, in eight of thecantons, all laws must be submitted to a vote (referendum). In seven others a vote must be held if a specified number of citizens demand it. In a further three cantons certain laws must be submitted to a vote and others must besubmitted if a specified proportion of citizens demand it.In national referenda, the national authorities provide the electorate withbasic information. The various campaign groups who furnish additional infor-mation material do not receive support from the public exchequer for thatpurpose. At the cantonal level local authorities provide information on the referendum issue.The question put is usually one to which the voter is asked to reply Yesor No. If the Federal Government disagree with the intent of a proposal madeby a certain number of citizens a counter-proposal may be submitted to a voteat the same time. Again a simple Yes answer (for the proposal or the counter-proposal) or No answer (for one or both proposals) is required.Constitutional changes must be approved by a majority of all votes cast andby a majority of cantons. For the adoption or rejection of legislation at national and cantonal level a simple majority of votes cast is sufficient. Votes are countedat communal and cantonal level (and at national level in national referenda)and published at cantonal (and national) level.Postal votes are only allowed for those in military service. Certain categories of sick or invalided persons may vote by proxy. These results are published asan integral part of the overall vote.united States of america the Federal Constitution makes no provision for referenda, but thirty-nineStates provide for referenda on proposals passed by the State legislatures or at local government levels, and twenty-one States for legislative initiatives by a percentage of voters which varies from State to State. Both devices may applyto constitutional amendment as well as to ordinary legislation, but at no levelof government can the scope of a referendum exceed the competence of thelegislative body concerned.Those responsible for proposing an initiative, often organised pressure groups,are also responsible for their own campaign costs. There are no limits on expen-diture. The cost of balloting, however, is generally borne by the State or muni-cipality, and in some States, eg in Oregon and California, the State providesofficial literature on referenda issues.Proposals submitted to the electorate may be complex, as in the 23-pointenvironmental plan put to the vote in the 1972 referendum on pollution inCalifornia, but the answer required is usually Yes or No. Referenda are generallyheld at the same time as the biennial congressional and local elections and normalfacilities for absentee (postal) voting are provided.Majorities required vary from State to State and can also vary according tothe issue (amendments to State constitutions sometimes require more than a simple majority). Referenda votes are counted at precinct level, but the officialresults are normally reported by country and, in a few instances, by city. the overall figures for spoilt votes are also published by some States.
