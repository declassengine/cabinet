C(75) 9 COPY NO17 January 1975CABINET4EUROPEAN COMMUNITY REFERENDUM:  ORGANISATIONREFERENDUM POLLMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. I have already circulated a paper (C(75) 7) on the question of holding national referendum on European Community membership, in which I mentioned (paragraphs 8 and 1.0) that I would also be circulating a paperrelating to the organisation of the referendum poll.    This paper deals withsuch issues as need to be considered straightaway.POLL SIZE AND QUESTION OF MAJORITY2.        A commitment to consult the electorate through a nationalreferendum poses questions about the basis of their &quot;final say&quot;.    (Theyare discussed in Chapter 1 of the official working party report, circulatedunder cover of C(75) 6).    Should compulsory voting (as in Australia) beconsidered?    Should the majority comprise a minimum proportion of the electorate (as in Denmark where 30 per cent is specified)?    irrespective of the size of the poll, can the result rest on a simple majority?    Shouldany special provision be made for taking account of the results in Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland?   How do we handle the interests of theChannel Isles and the Isle of Man?3.        The importance of these questions is underlined by the firmGovernment commitment to accept the decision of the British people throughthe ballot box, whatever that decision turns out to be.   And there is thefurther question of how we might deal with a situation in which a referendumhad failed to produce a conclusive result - particularly if we had decided toestablish special criteria in respect of the size of the poll and/or size ofthe majority.4.        We could confine our self at this stage to saying that we were stillstudying these matters.    Some, but not all, of them could be relevant to theprovisions of the Referendum Bill.    There is also a link with the questions(paragraphs 7-10 below) about how the results of the referendum would be counted and announced,    hi the circumstances there would be advantage inmaking our position clear where we can earlier rather than later.&apos;  &apos; &apos;   &apos;    &apos;:         &quot;      :  %   &apos; 1     - &apos;&apos;&apos;J      -CONFIDENTIAL
5. My own view is that we should conform as closely as possible to normal Parliamentary election practice and therefore that:a. We should not make voting compulsory.b. We should not require a minimum poll.c. We should be content with a bare majority.6.        This approach should restrict the potential problems.   At this stagehowever, it may be sufficient to make clear that we intend to be guided, sofar as possible, by normal Parliamentary election practice (except whereadministrative arrangements require the use of local Government electionmachinery), while being ready to give consideration to all relevantquestions affecting the organisation of the poll in preparing the ReferendumBill.POLL COUNT AND ANNOUNCEMENT7.        I assume that the local arrangements for voting will be similar tothose for local and Parliamentary elections, but that the voting figures will be aggregated and announced for the United Kingdom as a whole.There are two associated questions of political importance (see Chapter 3of the official working party report):-a.        Should voting results also be declared, or at least made public, locally - and, if so, by constituencies, local districts orcounties?or        b.        Should we seek to prevent local results becoming known and organise accordingly the arrangements for counting anddeclaration?8.        A report by the Home Office on the practical aspects of thealternative methods of counting is annexed.    This indicates that, if wewere to favour the course at b. above, we should need to avoid any localcounting arrangements, and to have some form of central count (either inLondon or at two or three major centres); that a central count would beslower, more complex and costly, and would present problems of security,staff and general implementation which will require further study;  and thatfor this reason and the urgent need to reserve accommodation, a decision in principle should now be reached on whether to keep open the centralcount option.
9.        But the crucial questions are political - as follows a. Whatever else we decide, may it not be best to avoidcounting and declaring results by Parliamentary constituencies?If this is agreed, the choice will lie between a count by counties and a central count,b. If we should adopt the course of a count by counties, do we need to have a declaration by counties?    Special countingarrangements would be needed and their results - which could not easily be concealed - could be immediately transmitted to london for aggregation in the United Kingdom total.c. The case for a central count rests on the political implications of the prospective voting pattern in Scotland, wales and Northern Ireland.    A difficult situation could arise, forexample, if the referendum results were finely balanced and it was clear from the voting results that Scotland had registered a heavymajority in one direction while the English majority was in another -especially at a time when the policy of devolution is beingformulated.    This outcome could indeed put our whole devolutionstrategy at risk.    But could the Government justify arrangementsspecifically designed to prevent Scotland, Wales and NorthernIreland from knowing (and they will wish to know) how they expressed their &quot;say&quot; on European Economic Communitymembership?   And could such arrangements be effective since,even if we provided, for example, for a statutory ban on independent and commercial polls in the Referendum Bill, that ban would be operative only for a limited period?10.        My colleagues may wish to decide these questions straightaway,There would be some advantage in doing so.    But all that is essential atthis stage is a decision in principle whether or not to rule out the possibilityof a central count.    The proposed Parliamentary statement need not refer to the matter: in reply to any question, the answer could be that the optionis not ruled out and is being further explored.&apos;OTHER ISSUES11.        There are other matters relating to the referendum poll which maywell be raised when the Parliamentary statement is made.    Majorexamples include:a. The electorate.    This will have to be the normal generalelection register (with the addition of peers).b. Absent Voting facilities where we shall have to operate bydeeming that normal facilities will be valid for the referendum.3
I propose that we should agree to consider any points made, but hold outno hope of changes in normal practice if they would delay the holding ofthe referendum.RECOMMENDATIONS12.       I ask my colleagues -a. To agree that, as regards the referendum poll issues set outin paragraphs 2-5 above, we should take the line at this stage thatwe intend to be guided, so far as possible, by normal parliamentary election practice, while being ready to consider any questions raised in the context of preparing the Referendum Bill.b. To consider the issue of the referendum poll count andannouncement, set out in paragraphs 7-9, and to decide whether we should plan to keep open the option of a central count with a viewto a possible decision later to organise the referendum poll in a manner designed to prevent the disclosure of local voting resultsthroughout the United Kingdom.c. To indicate in answer to any other questions raised about theorganisation of the poll that we can hold out no hope of changes inthe normal practice which would tend to delay the holding of the referendum.E privy Council Office17 January 19754
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY REFERENDUM,ORGANISATION OP COUNT - LOCAL OR CENTRALANNEXNote by the Home OfficeINTRODUCTIONThis paper explores in more detail the machinery for organising the casting and counting of votes in a referendum with particular reference to the alternatives of local or central counting.    A numberof assumptions have had to be made, most of which could be tested only by consultations outside Whitehall.    The conclusions reached aretherefore tentative.CASTING OP YOTES2.     Whatever the organisation of the count, the casting of votes willhave to be organised at local level.    The existing organisation is alocal government service which is responsible for running bothparliamentary and local government elections.   The two systems andthe relationship between them, are complicated and are described more fully in the Appendix.    The main features are that there is an officer in each district council responsible for running electic-ns to that council and for running parliamentary elections where the area of hisdistrict includes all, or a larger part of, a constituency.    Sincelocal government reorganisation constituency and local governmentboundaries have fallen very substantially out of alignment, but thereremain a significant number of constituencies which are coterminouswith a new district council.3.     In England and Wales the officers with the greatest experienceof running elections are, for the most part, those of the districtcouncil.    This is less true for Scotland, but there are no officialsthere with any stronger claims.    Similarly, the polling districts -which is the basic unit for voting purposes - for parliamentary elections are essentially the same as those for elections to district councils.   There are, therefore, strong arguments for putting theresponsibility for running the arrangements for casting votes in a referendum on to district returning officers since these will have themost experience and the organisation will be most familiar to thepublic.
4.     This would mean that the district returning, officers would &quot;beresponsible for organising and staffing polling; stations, dealing withpostal and proxy votes and handling all aspects of a referendum up toand including the sealing of the ballot &quot;boxes at the close of the poll.Normally it would also mean undertaking responsibility for the countbecause the result would be of essentially local relevance.   In a referendum, however, where only the national total is significant thereis no reason why separate arrangements for counting should not be made and there are various alternatives available.COUNTING OF VOTES LOCALLY5-     Given that district returning officers are responsible for running the polling arrangements, these could be arranged either on theparliamentary constituency or on the district council pattern so thatcounting could be carried out in terms of either of these units.   Asindicated above, a count in terms of districts would in fact alsocorrespond with constituencies in a certain number of cases.   A countorganised in this way would correspond very closely to that for ageneral election.    It seems likely, therefore, that there would befew significant administrative problems and that the result of thecount could be expected by the end of the day following polling day.The cost would be broadly the same as for a general election which,for the February 1974- election, excluding the cost of poll cards,amounted to between  3m and  4m.6.     There are, however, political objections to any system of countingwhich might produce local totals in terms of either constituencies ordistricts.    These were set out in the Working Party&apos;s report and appearto rule out this choice.7-     There would seem, however, to be little &quot;difficulty in arranging for votes to be counted by counties.   Each county has a returning officer for county council elections.   These officers have much lesselectoral experience than those in the districts, but ought to have little difficulty in organising a centralised count at county level,particularly as they would have no responsibility for organising the voting itself.    (It would also benefit the district returning officersin their more complicated job to be relieved of responsibility for thecount.)
8.     For the Northern Irish Border Poll, with an electorate of just over one million of whom about 600,000 actually voted, 440 countingstaff were employed and produced a result at the end of the dayfollowing the poll.   In England and Wales only London and some of themetropolitan counties have larger electorates than this and there seems no reason why, under such an arrangement it should takesignificantly longer to complete the count.9.     Ballot &quot;boxes already have to &quot;be transported from polling stations to a district centre.   There is no reason why their transport to a county centre should &quot;be significantly more complicated.   The cost would be a little more because of the longer journeys involved.   Inaddition, the burden on the police who would have to accompany theboxes would be a little greater (and see paragraphs 12-15).10.   London would present a special problem both, on account of itselectorate of over 5m and because there is no GLC returning officer:the job is done at London borough level.   Ad hoc provision for Londoncould be made in the Bill, however.   If the count bad to be completed in one day the London votes would probably require a counting staffof about 2,000;    or if two days could be allowed 1,000 for a two daycount.11.   A structure of polling by districts and counting by countieswould fit Scotland, though not quite as easily as for England.   InNorthern Ireland there is no permutation of the local governmentpattern which could be adopted which could not readily be translated into terms of Westminster constituencies.   It was for this, and other reasons, that special arrangements were made for the Border Poll votes to be counted centrally in Belfast.   It would seem that, for a referendum, the only satisfactory course would seem to be for the border Poll arrangements to be repeated and another central countarranged in Belfast.SECURITY12.   As regards security, the total police strength in England,Scotland and Wales is about 110,000 of whom no more than some20,000 are normally on duty at any one time.   Eor this, and other,reasons in recent years at general elections the police have not
&quot;been in constant attendance &quot;at polling stations and-only exceptionallyaccompany ballot boxes.   Their main effort is concentrated on the count,or when ballot boxes have to be stored overnight.   It would be unrealistic to assume that this occasion can be expected to pass off asquietly as a general election.   There may be groups seeking to demonstrate or simply to discredit the operation.13.   The nature and scale of the risk are difficult to assess at thisstage.   It seems likely that the risk will be greater when a number ofballot boxes have been gathered together, though there may be some areas where even individual boxes will be at risk.   During transit the riskwill be greater;    a centralised count itself would be an obvious pointof great sensitivity and the risk would be substantial as long as itcontinued.14.   Given police strength, it would be impossible for the police to bein attendance at every polling station throughout polling hours.   Thebest that can be done will be to give special attention to stationsconsidered specially at risk.   In the same way selective attention ofthis kind is the most that could be done for the transport of individualboxes to counting places.   If these are centralised by counties, boxeswill be at greater risk during transport than under the ordinaryelection arrangements and the demand on the police will be greater.It has to be recognised, however, that it would be impossible to achieveabsolute security and the number of journeys involved would precludeanything more than the best coverage for which the police could see a need.15*   Once in county centres, although the number of boxes would be greater than usual, sometimes by a very substantial factor, theprovision of security should be within police capability;   though the division of even 150 or so policemen (2 per centre to be in constantattendance) for a couple of days would put some strain on policeresources.COUNTING ob VOTES CENTRALLY\16.   The administrative aspects of such an arrangement would be     \significantly more complex than for a count at local level.   It is forconsideration, therefore, how far the political arguments, which havealready been deployed in the working party&apos;s report of 22nd November,justify undertaking the greater difficulties of this solution.
17-   The sizes of the electors are at present -England 33 millionScotland 3-7 millionWales 2    millionNorthern Ireland 1     million the turnout for general elections in recent years has rangedbetween 70% and. 80% so the total number of votes to be counted might beof the order of 30 million.    (It seems likely that a referendum total would in fact be a little lower than this).    The Northern Irishexperience suggests that about 150,000 man hours would be needed to carryout the various operations in counting this number of votes.   This maywell be an under-estimate.   For Northern Ireland only some 1,300 ballotboxes and 600,000 votes had to be handled.   For the United Kingdom thenumber will be 50,000 and 30 million.MECHANISATION18.   An undertaking on this scale calls first for the possibilitiesof computerisation to be examined.   These are not very promising.Purpose-designed equipment could not be introduced in less than oneyear and the only practicable course would be to use the facilities of existing equipment.   In this field the only known resources whichmight possibly be adopted for this purpose are those of the NationalGiro.   This would mean that special ballot papers would have to be printed capable of being read by the 8iro&apos;s machines.   There are,however, a number of problems.a. To be handled satisfactorily by machine it is preferable thatthe ballot papers should not be folded.   If they are, however, the&quot;reading&quot; process will take longer.   Voters might therefore haveto be advised to ignore the normal electoral practice and instead to seal the completed paper in an envelope to be provided, whichwould then be put in the ballot box.b. The ballot boxes would have to be transported to Bootle wheretie machines are installed.   More than half of the electorate,however, live in Southern England, particularly in the South East,and the transport problem would be substantial.   The security aspectwould also be considerable.c. The machines would have difficulty in handling doubtful votesor in recognising some as doubtful at all.
ds,     There are stages in the count which it Is impels:&apos;;&apos;&apos;-&apos;. .. tomechanise, eg taking papers out of boxes, unfolding them, andcompleting the preliminary reconciliation,,    Even for machine&quot;reading&quot;, the papers must be faced up and turned the right way.These manual operations are so extensive that elaborate machine&quot;reading&quot; provides negligible savings.e, There are difficulties in obtaining the necessary paper inthe time.f. The system is untested and unforeseen problems might upset thewhole operation.Mechanisation of this kind, therefore, appears to be impracticable.There are simpler paper counting machines which could help with abasically manual count.   These could provide some reduction in theresources needed and are considered below.A CENTRALISED MANUAL COUNT19*     The only practicable possibility would se&apos;em to be a single countbased in London.   There are a number of reasons for this.a. The object of the exercise would be to conceal regionalsub-totale.   This would be defeated if any separate Scottish,Welsh or Northern Irish figure became available.   Even if morethan one centre was used, therefore, all would have to be inEngland (or elaborate sorting procedures would be involved).b. The problems of transport and security to several centres aregreater than to one.c. Staff and accommodation have to be obtained for severalcentres and must be available for the same days.d. The problem of accounting for the receipt of all ballot boxesbecomes much greater.
20.   It seems likely that it would be necessary to depend primarily on civil servants or local government staff because of the security-aspects of casual recruitment.   There are government offices atNewcastle and Manchester which have executive and clerical staff insuch numbers (11,800 and 9*500 respectively) that they might be ableto provide enough to count, perhaps a quarter, of the total votes ineach case.   But there are no premises large enough in Newcastle fora count on this scale.   There are premises in Manchester (eg Belle Vue,with 135,000 square feet, - subject to availability) but in either case the secondment of staff in these numbers would seriously inter-fere with the work of the Departments concerned.   A further considera-tion is that a natural arrangement would be, to count Scottish andNE England votes in Newcastle and Welsh, Northern Irish andNW England votes in Manchester.   This would amount to a little under one quarter of the electorate in each case.   But this would producetotals in which regional elements would still be disproportionatelyhigh and, if the total leaked, would give a strong pointer to differences in regional voting.21.   It seems likely, therefore, that the only practicable coursewould be to assemble the 50,000 ballot boxes in London for a singlecount there.   It may not be practicable, given security requirements,to assemble all these in London by the following morning and the handling problem will.be considerable.   The absolute minimum wouldinvolve a two-day count calling for some 7*000 counters;   a more realistic estimate is a three-day count involving perhaps 5,000counters.   If as long as five days oould be allowed the number ofcounters would be about 3,000.   If sufficient paper counting machines- 100 to 200 would be needed - could be obtained these figures mightbe reduced by up to 25%.

22o   The accommodation needed for this exercise would need to be in large halls where the work could be supervised not only by the responsibility-ible supervisory staff but also by independent observers representingeither the two sides in the campaign or a neutral element .   For a twoday count about 300,000to 400,000 sq ft of accommodation would be needed.   This would be less for a longer count involving fewercounters but, even for a week, the requirement would be over 100,000sq fto   At the higher level, only Earls Court or Olympia would be suitable in London-   Olympia would be available for 13-15 June;Earls Court is free from 10 June to 5 July.   In either case a bookingwould probably have to be made before the end of January.   If adecision was left any later it can only be a matter of guessworkwhether these premises will still be free.   Smaller premises, suchas Alexandra Palace, might be available for the longer period forsmaller numbers.   Consideration would, however, be needed of the ancillary facilities, such as catering, parking and access for delivery and storage of ballot boxes.2%   There are no defence resources in the London area which would afford facilities of this kind.   Outside London some establishmentsexist but are open to a number of disadvantages.   Large open-planaccommodation normally takes the form of hangars and would be lackingin a number of facilities.   Access would be difficult, there would besecurity problems from the defence side, and there would be interruption-tion of normal service work.   The possibility of using defenceresources could be further explored, but seem unlikely to offer asolution.24,   The probability, therefore is that a centralised count in london would call for the use of a number of separate premises.   This wouldmultiply the problems of administration and security.25*   As regards staffing, the main requirements are aptitude and security.   The latter consideration points to the employment of civilservants or local government staff.   There is no precedent for anexercise on this scale, the essential requirements of which are thatthe right numbers should turn up for the requisite days involved.In the Greater London area some 68,000 civil servants are employed upto and including the level of EO.   It might oust be possible forUP to 7,000 to be produced for a two day job, but the interferencewith normal work would be considerable.   There is nowhere in the
rest of the country where similar figures could he produced.   It mightbe possible to secure a number of retired civil servants, but thenumbers available in the London area will be known only to individual departments.   The total number of pensioners is likely to representperhaps one quarter or one fifth of the number in post, and many willhave moved away from London.26.   Local government staff, who have experience of counting for elections, could he another source.   It is estimated that, for ageneral election, perhaps 3,000 or so are so employed.   But the countis usually at night.   We do not know how willing local authorities would be to give up staff in any numbers for a day time count lastingtwo or three days.   It might be reasonable to expect up to 2,000,including the GLC.27.   Civil servants and local government officers together might justmake up the total, the alternative would be casual recruitment.   Theonly precedent was for petrol rationing where the recruitment was atshorter notice for what was expected to be a commitment for some months.This produced 1,700 for ten different locations in the country.   Thebulk were housewives.   The difficulty of casual recruitment for a referendum would be the exclusion of persons determined to sabotage theexercise.   This may be a risk that would have to be taken.28.   It seems, clear that the recruitment of staff, preliminarytraining and briefing, and the booking of premises would have to be initiated some months, at least., before the day for polling.   It would therefore have to be started before any legislative sanction wasawarded and would only be undertaken initially as part of a depart-menfs responsibility.29.   It would be for consideration what machinery would be needed toundertake responsibility for this task.   The primary consideration willbe the manifest fairness of the operation.   It will not be acceptable to leave the result open to challenge in the courts - the procedure for ordinary elections - because of the delay this could involve.   Butif there is to &quot;be no procedure for- challenging the result it may bedesirable to appoint some independent person of standing to act as national returning officer and to &quot;be finally responsible for theresult.   Policy decisions would, however, have to be taken long before statutory responsibility of this kind could be conferred.   What
would be needed would be an administrative unit within a Departmenttogether with, for preference, an informal appointment of the person to be ultimately responsible, perhaps in an advisory capacity to theMinister concerned, who, for this purpose, would probably be theHome Secretary.   The person to be responsible could then be associated fully with all stages of the work until the time arrivedfor him to assume statutory responsibility.   It has to be recognised,however, that these arrangements necessarily involve anticipatingRoyal Assent to a considerable degree.SECURITY3O0   The security aspects of polling and transport of boxes to their first assembly points are dealt with in paragraphs 12 to 15-   For acentralised count there would be no point in transport to countycentres and the better arrangement would be for the boxes to be assembled by districts.   Arrangements would then have to be made forthese assemblages, which would number some 500 or so, to be conveyed toLondon.   This would have to be a responsibility of the central unit.The most practical arrangement would be to use rail and airlines whichare accustomed to making security arrangements for special cargoes.The bulk of this operation, however, might well present the railway andair transport police with substantial problems.   The custody overnightand guarding of the transport to rail and air heads would also call fora special deployment of perhaps 1000 to 2000 civilian police and thiswould present an exceptionally heavy drain on their resources at onetime.31.   The concentration of cargoes of this kind from all over thecountry, given the security aspects, might well not be completed in asingle day.   Deliveries would be arriving at various London terminithroughout the day and possibly over a longer period.   The centralunit would have to be responsible for obtaining transport from thesetermini to the counting point.   The police would need to be presentin some force at the termini and, depending on the character of thetransport, might need to accompany the vehicles to the countingcentre (or centres).   They would also need to be present at the centreduring the conduct of the count in some force.   These requirements would impose a heavy burden on the resources of the Commissioner whoseforce is already seriously under strength.:(.
CONCLUSION32.   This paper has dealt with the problems of organising a referendum poll and counting the votes.   This more detailed examina-tion of the problems suggests that:a. polling would be conducted by local government districts:b. for a local count, counting by counties would be practica-ble (regions in Scotland and a centralised count for NorthernIreland);c. for a centralised count, important aspects need furtherconsideration before the practicability oould be clearly and fully established.   The work undertaken since the working party&apos;s report shows that:i. there is no mechanical approach which could provide any practical alternative to a primarily manual operation.ii. a manual count would probably have to be centralised inLondon.iii. it would require from 2,500 to 7,000 staff, depending onthe speed with which the result was needed and on the availabi-lity of simple counting machines.iv. it would require accommodation of from 100,000 to 400,000square feet, depending on the same factors.v. there would be considerable difficulties in securing staff and premises for the time in question.vi. forward planning would need to be initiated some months inadvance.vii. there might be a need to appoint a national returning officer.Hone Office, S.W.1.v January 1975
APPENDIXPABLIATffiNTARY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTORAL ARRANGEMENTSElectoral arrangements at both parliamentary and localgovernment level are a local government service, but the relation between the two systems is complex.2.     The officer responsible for the conduct of elections isthe returning officer.     For parliamentary elections in Englandand Wales the returning officer is one of a number of localdignitaries such as the sheriff, chairman of a district council,or mayor of a London borough.     His functions, however, are purelyformal and the substantive work is required by statute to be performed by the acting returning officer.     The identity of thelatter depends on the relationship of the constituency to thelocal government area.     Where the constituency is coterminouswith or wholly contained in a district council or London borough,the acting returning officer is the electoral registration officer of that council or borough.     In other cases, where the constituency straddles boundaries, the acting returning officer is the electoral registration officer designated by the HomeSecretary.     The principle for these designations has been,almost without exception, to pick the officer of the areahaving the larger electorate.     The registration officer is anofficer appointed by the district council or London borough,often, but not always, the chief executive.3.    For local government elections the returning officer, whois responsible for the whole range of duties unless he choosesto delegate them, is, for counties, an officer appointed by thedistrict council, for the GLC and London boroughs, officersappointed by the London borough councils (there is no singleofficer for the GLC) and for parishes and communities an officerappointed by the district council.4.     In Scotland, the returning officer for parliamentary elections is the sheriff and the effective work is undertaken by the Sheriff Clerk, a full-time judicial officer.     The localauthorities in Scotland play little part in parliamentary elections, but the Sheriff Clerk service resent this part oftheir duties and are unlikely to co-operate in any extension.5.    The registration officer in Scotland is the valuationofficer, and he plays no part in the conduct of electionsthemselves.6.    For local government elections in Scotland the returning officer is an officer appointed by the appropriate council moreor less as in England.     At this level, therefore, the twosystems correspond except that in Scotland the local governmentreturning officers have no experience of parliamentary electionsor registration duties.OFFICERS
7. In Northern Ireland there is a centralised electoral systemrun from Belfast-BOUNDARIES8.    In England and Wales there are basically three situations.Most London boroughs comprise two or three constituencies, butindividual constituencies do not cross borough boundaries.Outside London a number of the old county boroughs which arenow district councils are coterminous with constituencies.For the most part, however, the new district councils have quite different boundaries from the constituencies, and the boundaries of the latter straddle both district and county boundaries.9.
