1976 CENSUS OF POPULATIONiINTRODUCTION1 The Government have decided that, subject to Parliamentary approval, a census of Population should be taken in 1976; the proposed date is 16 May.This White Paper describes why a &apos;mid-term&apos; census between the 1971 and 1981censuses is needed, what topics it will cover and how it will be taken.2 The object of the census is to provide statistics about the whole population and groups within it, so that government and local authorities can do theirjob efficiently. The information must be collected about each individual in thepopulation but after collection it is processed into anonymous statistical form.No information from the census leaves the Census Offices except in a statisticalform that does not reveal anything about an identifiable individual.3 The Government recognise the importance of ensuring that the personal information provided in the census should be safeguarded. Means of doing thiswill be explained to the public at the time of the census: they are summarised in paras 23-30 below.NEED FOR CENSUS INFORMATION IN 19764 Section 1 of the Census Act 1920* requires that there must be at least fiveyears between censuses. In practice censuses have been taken every ten years between 1801 and 1971, apart from the war year of 1941. In 1966 the firstmid-decade census was taken, covering a 10 per cent sample of the population.A sample cannot, however, be used this time because the reorganised localauthorities need accurate and comprehensive statistics about local areas and about groups in the population with special needs or characteristics. the census to be taken in 1976 will therefore cover the whole population thoughcertain questions will be asked on a sample basis.5 Census statistics are needed by government departments and local authorities for planning and developing their policies and for monitoring the effects ofthose policies. They are also needed to inform Parliament and the general public, and for industry and research. Comprehensive statistics which are consistent over the whole country for regions, local authority areas and smallerareas can be collected only at a census. They are needed about such matters asthe size and composition of the population; the number of people movinginto and out of areas; the numbers in various groups who may require specialservices, such as working mothers with children at home and old people livingalone; housing amenities and the extent of overcrowding; local employment;the numbers of people with special qualifications; and transport flows. Censusstatistics are used to guide the activities of central and local government tothose areas, services or sections of the population where they are most needed,and to share out fairly the central governments contribution to local rates.*10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5, c. 41.
6 Populations in local areas can alter rapidly in size, composition and needs,and the pace of change has accelerated; Thus the 1971 census information willbe seriously out of date by the end of the decade. Without a mid-term censusin 1976, decisions by government and by local authorities as far ahead as1982/83 (when the main results of the 1981 census can be expected) would haveto be based on information collected in 1971. This would not be satisfactory.n  ,.TOPICS COVERED BY THE CENSUS j7 The Government intend that the next census form will be the shortest that can collect the essential national and local information. They have thereforereduced the total number of questions as compared with 1971, and have decidedthat no householder will be asked all the questions on the list. In England andWales there will be ten different types of form, each type to be completed by adifferent 10 per cent of the population. Each form will contain a common coreof basic questions, together with a selection Of other questions, the selectionvarying from form to form. The basic questions cover demographic items (sex,marital status, etc), country of birth and-parents&apos; countries of birth, usualaddress and duration of residence at that address, job or other activity, housing and cars. In Scotland, because of the: small size of the populations in many areas and their varying circumstances, there will be no sampling. Instead, asingle form will be used containing the questions that are most important in scottish circumstances.8 The following subjects on which questions were asked in 1971 will be omittedaltogether in 1976: ...... ......Relationship of person to head of household;Year of first entry to UK (for those born abroad);Month and year of birth of each child born alive in marriage (for married,widowed or divorced women under 60);Month and year of first marriage and, where first marriage had ended, themonth and year that it ended (for married, widowed or divorcedwomen under 60);Occupation one year ago.In Scotland some more subjects will be omitted in order to shorten the singleform that will be used there. These are parents&apos; countries of birth, schoolqualifications, cooker, kitchen sink and hot water supply.9 The subjects of the questions proposed for the census are described below,with explanations of why they will be asked and with examples of what the answers will be used for. Some of the questions will be asked in only one or twoof the countries and these are marked with the initials of the countries wherethey will be asked, eg the question &quot;parents&apos; countries of birth&apos; is marked EWbecause it will be asked in England and Wales only. In England and Wales somewill be asked of only a sample of the population and these are marked witha % sign. In England no census form will contain more than 19 of the subjects
listed, in Wales none will contain more than 20, and the Scottish form will contain 22, some of them shortened; The appendix gives a complete list of the subjects on which questions will be asked and states the countries where they will apply, and shows which of the subjects marked % appear on each of the tendifferent forms used in England and Wales.10 General questions the first job of the census is to count the population. Accurate figures are needed for many reasons. For example, the equitable distribution of the rate support Grant (some  3,500m in 1974/75) requires up-to-date figures of localpopulations. These figures with forecasts of population are also taken intoaccount in allocating funds (over  2,500m) to health authorities in England andWales to meet the cost of services they administer. Even small errors in theestimates of local populations can alter local grants by substantial amounts.The general topics are as follows: - &apos; \v.(1) Name(2) Usualresidence(3) Whereaboutson censusnight(4) Sex(5) Date of birth(6) Marital statusNames are required to make certain that theobligation to complete a census form has been complied with. If there is a query about amissing or incomplete answer after the form hasbeen collected, the name is needed to ensure thatthe right person is approached. The names andaddresses do not enter the computer thatprocesses the census results.In the census, people are counted initially at the places&apos; where they spend census night. Buteveryone is asked to state his usual residence sothat those away from home can be counted aspart of the population of the areas where theylive. Figures of the population usually resident in each area are needed, for example, for the calculation of local grants from the centralgovernment. The answers to the question abouthousehold members who are away on censusnight contribute to information on householdstructure, including, for instance, estimates ofthe number of one-parent families.The answers to these questions give the demo-graphic characteristics of the populations oflocal areas and help to show where facilitiessuch as nursery schools or day centres for the elderly are needed. The answers, in conjunctionwith other census information, establish, forexample, the numbers of married women whoare working and the types of jobs being done byyoung people. The figures of population analysedby sex, age and marital status form the basis of estimates of the future population.
EWEWEW(7) Tenure ofhouseholdaccommodation(8) Accommodationnumber ofrooms, andwhether sharing(9)Amenities shared orexclusive use of:cooker,sink,fixed bath,hot water,The stock of housing and its quality is measuredseparately in the following categories: owner-occupied, rented from local councils, rentedfrom private landlords and tied accommodation,distinguishing furnished from unfurnishedlettings.The number of rooms, taken with the number of people in a household, is used to measureovercrowding. The question on sharing isconcerned to find out how many householdshave to share circulation space (or, in Scotland,rooms) and, in conjunction with the questions on sharing amenities, to find out how manyhouseholds do not have a fully separate and private home of their own.Renovation grants are available for all theseamenities except cookers. Even today there arestill many areas where more than a quarter ofall households do not have the exclusive use ofall the main amenities. The situation in a localarea can change rapidly where, for instance,single households occupying older houses areinside flush toilet being replaced by several households,outside flush toilet12 Migration questionsEvery year more than one person in ten changes his address ie migrates. Thenumbers and characteristics of the population of a small area can thereforechange markedly in five years. The census provides statistics on the numbers of people who have moved from one area to another and the characteristics ofthose who have moved. This information is a main ingredient in making thepopulation projections that are needed for regional and local planning.EW    (10) Date when the    This gives the volume of movement into eachperson first lived area in England and Wales,at his usualaddress%(11) Usual address1 year ago% (12) Usual address5 years agoThese indicate where the migrants came from,and in Scotland they are also used to measure the volume of movement into each area.The census finds out about the stock of housing and its quality all over thecountry and about the areas where over-crowding or poor quality housingpersist. The census figures on housing are used, with projections of futurepopulations and households, in deciding the programmes for house building,the new towns and overspill. Up-to-date information is important for theseimmensely expensive programmes.
13 Country of birth questions(13) Own country of  These questions distinguish those who were bornbirth abroad and, on the forms used in England andEW    (14) Parents&apos; Wales, those whose parents were born abroad.countries of birth The answers will be used to estimate the numberof people of overseas origin and to show how theyare distributed regionally and locally. Inconjunction with answers to other questions on housing, jobs, etc they will show how the standards of the immigrant communities corn-pare with the standards of the indigenouspopulation. The answers on own country of birth also give the numbers of people who have moved between the different countries withinthe United Kingdom, for example people born in Scotland who have moved to England.14 Employment questions the census is the most comprehensive source of information about people atwork, giving details of occupations, qualifications and ages of workers in thedifferent industries all over the country. It is a source of information aboutgroups not covered by routine employment and unemployment statistics, suchas the self-employed and those, including many married women, who are looking for work but are not registered as unemployed. Much of this information is needed for regional and local policies; for example, in deciding to create newjobs in a particular place, or to provide training facilities to enable people tomove to new jobs, or in identifying areas of deprivation calling for specialgovernment assistance. Statistics of the numbers in each industry and occupationare also used in medical research into how a man&apos;s employment is related to his health and accident record and, ultimately, to his cause of death.(15) economic activity lastweek% (16) Name and business ofemployer% (17) Occupation% (18) EmploymentstatusEveryone aged 16 or over is asked whether, inthe previous week, he was: in a paid job, seeking work, a student, retired, a housewife, etc.This is asked in order to identify the industry inwhich a person works. To do this accurately, itis necessary to ask for the name of the firm organisation as well as the type of businesscarried on. The address of workplace, listedunder transport questions, para 16, is also usedto identify the industry if the firm carries on different businesses at different addresses.People are asked to name their occupation andto describe the work they do.This is to distinguish between apprentices, other employees and the self-employed.These four questions, (15)-(18), normally refer to a person&apos;s main employmentlast week or, if he is seeking work or retired, to his most recent full-time job.
The answers for those seeking work show the skills available amongst those who might be brought into employment. The answers for retired people are used in research into industrial health. Married and widowed women who are neitherin a job nor looking for one will not have to answer these questions.% (19) Basic weekly      This question distinguishes full-time from part-hours worked     time workers and is particularly useful forstudies of special groups such as mothers withyoung children.15 Questions on educational qualificationsThe census provides information on the qualified people in the country and thedistribution among industries and occupations of those of them in paid jobs.This information is used for devising policies on education and re-training andon industrial recruitment and redeployment. It is also used in advising young people on education and careers.(20) Educationalqualifications:EW %      (a) School The first part of the question (asked in Englandetc and Wales only) is about qualifications usuallyobtained at school (including CSE, &apos;0&apos; and &apos;A&apos;levels) and ONC and OND.%      (b) HigherThe second part asks about higher qualificationsincluding degrees, HNC, HND, membership of professional institutions and nursing and teach-ing qualifications. There is a great variety ofqualifications and to classify and analyse themcorrectly the title, major subject (or subjects),awarding institution and year obtained are asked for.16 Transport questions the census measures traffic to work and to school etc in terms of the numberstravelling, origins and destinations of journeys and the main means of transportused. It gives the numbers of people who work in each local authority area,which may be very different from the numbers of workers resident in the area and shows the &apos;catchment areas&apos; from which those who work in the area come.The figures are analysed for small areas, as well as for whole districts and towns,and are used in planning public transport and roads. In areas with majortransport problems this basic information from the census may be supplemented by local travel surveys.(21) Number of car sand vansavailable foruse by thehouseholdThe answers to this question show the areas where people are most dependent on public transport and where the demand for road spacefor private transport is likely to be greatest.
Journey to work: The address of place of work shows the destina-% (22) Address of place tion of the journey to work; usual address,of work item (2) above, shows where the journey starts.% (23) Main means of The second question here (23) asks for thetransport used means of transport normally used over theto work longest part, by distance, of the journey.Questions are being included for the first time on travel to school and other places of studybecause these journeys form a substantial partof the morning traffic. The questions are similarto those on journey to work except that they include a question on the address from whichthe journey begins: this is because many olderstudents live away from home during term-time.Journey to place of study:EW % (24) Address ofplace of studyEW % (25) Means oftransport usedto place of studyEW % (26) Address of start of journey toplace of study17 Welsh language in WalesW    (27) Does the person The answers to these questions, which are askedspeak Welsh and, in Wales of everyone aged 3 years or over, willif so, does he be used by the Council for the Welsh Languagespeak English, to monitor the progress of the language and inread Welsh, making their proposals for the future. Thewrite Welsh questions are the same as those asked in 1971.18 Gaelic language in ScotlandS (28) Does the person This question, which is asked in Scotland ofspeak Gaelic everyone aged 3 years or over, will be askedonly or can he about speaking ability only, as in the censusesspeak both of 1961 and earlier, and not, as in 1971, aboutGaelic and reading and writing ability. The results willEnglish show how many people can speak the languageand what changes in numbers have taken placeover the years.rnSURVEYS LINKED TO THE 1976 CENSUS19 There will be two kinds of sample surveys linked to the census. participation in all of them will be voluntary.20 The first kind will investigate the quality of the information produced bythe census. Census questions may be misunderstood by the people who answerthem or may not apply to their particular circumstances. The extent to whichthis happens will be measured by interviewing a sample of 6,000 or 7,000 people who have completed census forms. In addition three surveys will be made to measure the coverage achieved by the census:(i) a sample of areas will be selected and a list of habitable buildings in them will be compiled, which will be compared with the lists madeby the enumerators (ie by the people who deliver and later collect the census forms);
(ii) some 100,000 households will be interviewed to see whether theinstructions about the persons to be included in the census returnwere understood and followed correctly; and(iii) a sample of dwellings listed by enumerators as &apos;unoccupied&apos; or&quot;occupied by a household away on census night&apos; will be revisited to check the accuracy of enumerators&apos; descriptions.Surveys similar to all these were made after the 1966 and 1971 censuses. Onthis occasion the check of unoccupied dwellings will be extended by makingseveral recalls at these dwellings over a period of time to find out for how longdwellings remain vacant and, if possible, why.21 The second kind of survey linked to the census is addressed to a sample ofnames drawn from the census lists but asks questions which go beyond whatwas asked on the census form itself. It is an effective way of asking not onlyquestions that are inappropriate to a compulsory census but also questions thatapply to only a minority of the population: this is because the survey can be confined to people concerned with its subject, and questions which have alreadybeen answered in the census need not be repeated. Four such surveys havebeen proposed, two of which would be carried out in Scotland only.Family formation Questions asked in previous censuses on the number andspacing of children born to married women will not be asked in the 1976census. A voluntary interview survey may, however, be addressed to a sample of some 7,000 to 8,000 women of child-bearing ages drawn fromthe census returns. The survey, supplemented by the results of similarsurveys in earlier years, will help to show how changing patterns of marriage and family building may be related to economic and social factors and tofamily planning practices.Migration within Great Britain The census questions themselves will elicitbasic information on migration. This may be supplemented by a samplesurvey to find out more about the characteristics of people who move and why they move. The number of people asked to take part would probably not exceed 100,000.Qualified teachers and nurses in Scotland Two separate surveys are envisagedto find out more about the current situation of qualified teachers andqualified nurses in Scotland who were not employed in their professionsat the time of the census and about the circumstances in which they mightreturn to their professions. The results would help in planning the futurestaffing of the services. The surveys would cover some 5,000 to 6,000people in all by post and about 1,500 qualified nurses by interview.22 These are the only surveys at present being planned. Any proposal to makeanother survey of a similar kind linked to the 1976 census will be announced in Parliament. The surveys will be handled by the Census and Social SurveyDivisions of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and by the CensusBranch of the General Register Office for Scotland. The procedures whichare adopted for ensuring the confidentiality of information collected in the census itself, described below, will be applied equally to information collected in any voluntary survey linked to the census.\
rvCONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDEDArrangements for the completion and collection of forms23 The head of a private household will be responsible for completing the census form for that household and other members of the household will givethe head the information about themselves that he needs in order to complete the form. But, as in previous censuses, any household member aged 16 or over may ask for an individual form for separate return to the enumeratorunder sealed cover. In non-private establishments such as hotels and hospitalsa separate form will be provided for each person.24 Census forms will be delivered and collected by temporarily recruitedenumerators who will check that the forms are complete and will be able togive householders any help they want in completing them. Experience hasshown that nearly all householders welcome this. Anyone who has any difficultiesin completing the form will be able to telephone for guidance to a census officefree of charge.25 Care will be taken to avoid as far as practicable placing an enumerator inan area where there are people who are known to him personally or throughbusiness contacts. But it is impossible to guarantee that an enumerator will never know, or be known to, any householder, especially in sparsely populated areas. Where this does happen, enumerators will have instructions to offer the householder an envelope in which the completed form may be sealed sothat it will not be seen by the enumerator. Indeed any householder can ask foran envelope so that his census form will not be seen by the enumerator. Whererequired, the envelope may be marked to be returned unopened to the regionalcensus offices to be set up in England and Wales (in Scotland to the central office), and in this case the census form will not be seen by any of the localcensus field staff. In exceptional circumstances a householder may post hisform to the appropriate census office. In all cases where the form is sealedthe obligation to make a return will not be discharged until a fully completedform is received by the census office. The public will be informed of these arrangements.Further aspects of confidentiality26 As in the past, all staff employed in the census offices will be bound bythe Official Secrets Acts and will sign a declaration acknowledging this. Fieldstaff will sign an undertaking under the Census Act 1920 not to divulge or make use of any information obtained in the course of their duties, and this obligation will continue after the end of their employment. All staff will be warned against inadvertent disclosure. The Government consider that censusstaff have an excellent record for maintaining the confidentiality of the informa-tion entrusted to them and they are confident that this will be maintained.27 The confidentiality of the information collected will be safeguarded bothby the physical security of the premises where it is kept and processed and bythe design of the computer system. This was the subject of the White Paper
Security of the Census of Population (Cmnd 5365), which set out the recom-mendations made in reports by the British Computer Society (BCS) and bynominees of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) following the 1971 census.The recommendations made by the BCS (paras 2.3.1-2.3.5) about the securityof processing have been acted upon by the Census Offices. But the Governmentdeferred their decision on two of the Societies&apos; recommendations one fromthe BCS that there should be independent monitoring of the operations atcensus processing centres from an early stage of the planning and design of the census, and the other from the RSS that there should be a standing review body to handle any complaints about the conduct of the census (paras 2.3.and 4.22(6) and (c)) until they had reached conclusions in the wider field coveredby the Younger Committee&apos;s Report on Privacy (Cmnd 5012). So far as theBCS recommendation is concerned the present Government believe that itwould be premature to make special arrangements relating to the censusuntil they have made final decisions on the issues arising from the Governmenfswider study of questions of safeguarding personal information held on computersfollowing the Younger Report. As to the recommendation of the nominees ofthe RSS for a standing review body, the Government are giving this matter further consideration before deciding whether such a review body should beestablished for the 1976 census.28 As in previous censuses, the names and addresses shown on the individualcensus form will not enter the computer.29 All the information released by the Census Offices from the census will bein a statistical form, whether it is published or passed to individual customersunpublished; and it will be arranged so as to avoid disclosing information aboutidentifiable individuals whether directly or by comparison with other informa-tion. Where necessary, the figures released will have been rounded or otherwiseadjusted to ensure this. The Census Offices will maintain for public inspectiona record of any unpublished information passed to individual customers.Any statistical information released from the census to anybody at all can be purchased by anyone else. vi30 Census returns are confidential for 100 years, the only exceptions to this rule being in connection with a prosecution under the Census Act; or in certainnarrowly-defined circumstances in which a limited amount of information,never less than 50 years old, may be released to the person himself (or, if hehas died, to his immediate relatives and descendants) for example to helpestablish entitlement to a pension or an inheritance.VPUBLICATION OF RESULTS31 The Government recognise that the longer it takes to extract and publish the results of the census the less useful they are. They acknowledge that it hastaken longer to extract some of the results of the 1971 census than had been estimated, and regret the trouble this has caused for local authorities andfor research. They aim to publish the results of the 1976 census earlier than for1971. In England and Wales a number of processing offices will be set up in
areas where suitable staff and accommodation can be found. In Scotland theprocessing will be done in a single office. A new and more powerful computeris being installed at the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys.32 A preliminary report will be published as soon as possible after census day and the aim will be to make all the main results available within three years.Some of the analyses requested by individual customers will take longer than this to produce. The timetable will depend on how quickly customers specifyexactly what they want and how much they want. In order to make the censusresults available to a wider public, a number of simple summaries and explana-tory guides will be issued.PUBLICITY33 There will be an information campaign to explain why the census is needed,how its results will be used and what is being done to safeguard the individualdetails collected. An information leaflet will be delivered to each householdabout two weeks before census day.vi the PARLIAMENTARY PROCESS34 A draft Order in Council is being laid before Parliament for approval.The Order is subject to negative resolution in both Houses, and topics not specifically authorised in the schedule to the Census Act 1920 require affirmative resolution. At a later stage the Ministers responsible for the census (the Secretaryof State for Social Services and the Secretary of State for Scotland) will makeCensus Regulations and lay them before Parliament. Each set of regulations will include specimen census forms.
