JHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S government(75) 1 COPY no 6 23 January 1975CABINETSPECIAL FAMILY ALLOWANCEMemorandum by the Paymaster GeneralL, During the Cabinet&apos;s discussion of public expenditure the Secretaryof State for Social Services proposed the extension in 1976-77 of family allowances to the first child of one-parent families;  and the Committee onPoverty, which was set up immediately after that discussion, was asked to clarify the facts and issues involved in order to provide the basis for anearly decision by the Cabinet (CC(74) 49th Conclusions, Minute 3).    Thismemorandum presents the results of their consideration of the matter.    AtAnnexes I and II are memoranda by the Minister of State, Department ofHealth and Social Security, and by the Treasury and the Inland Revenue,respectively, which were considered by the Committee,THE ISSUES2, The proposal is for a Special Family Allowance (Special FAM) of I, 50 a week for the first children of one-parent families during the12 months from April 1976.    From April 1977 this would be absorbed in thenew Child Benefits scheme.    On this basis, the cost of Special FAM wouldbe  16^ million in public expenditure terms, the net cost to the Exchequerbeing  9 million.    Within these figures is a sum of about  if million for administration in 1976-77,    The main issue for the Cabinet is whether, if ;the proposal were adopted, the cost could in practice be confined in this way.3, The actual benefit derived from Special FAM, after taking account ofany other tax liabilities and benefits of the recipients, would be as follows:-a.  1. 50 for those who neither draw Family Income Supplement(FIS) nor pay income tax, including those who are entitled to supplementary benefit and have not claimed it, and those whoseincomes hover around the supplementary benefit level,b. 75p for those who receive FIS but pay nw income tax,c. 67p for those who do not receive FIS but do pay income tax.1
d&quot;&quot;0 Kl Pi nc KJTI A I\j m ri ue. im i imld. Up to  1,40 for those whose supplementary benefit entitlementis less than  1.50: they will gain the difference between theirsupplementary benefit entitlement and  1, 50.e. Between 6?p and  1. 50 for those who are just below the taxthreshold and are brought into tax by the introduction of Special FAM.4. There would be no benefit -f. For those receiving supplementary benefit at a rate of  1.50or more, or for those who receive dependency increases with national insurance benefits.g. For those receiving FIS and paying income tax.THE ARGUMENTS5. There are two main arguments in favour of introducing Special FAM -i. One-parent families as a whole are at an obvious disadvan-tage compared with two-parent families as a whole; their needshave been highlighted by the 1974 Finer Report, and they form alarge and identifiable group who can be helped without extending thearea of means-testing.ii. Announcement of Special FAM would help to mitigate anyunfavourable response to the Government^ decision, which will haveto be announced soon, to defer introducing the Child Benefits schemeuntil 1977.6. The main arguments against introducing Special FAM are -i. Not all one-parent families are amongst the poorest, andsome two-parent families&apos; needs are greater than the needs of thosewho would benefit from Special FAM.ii. An identifiable separate benefit for one-parent families in1976-77 would be likely to give rise to pressure for a permanentextra benefit for this group.    The cost of such a permanent benefit,if one were introduced, would depend on the level of benefit but, asan illustration, if there were a continuing preference for one-parent families in 1977, then at  1, 50 per child the public expenditure costat 1974 Survey prices would be  21 million a year and at  3 per childwould be  43 million; if the preference was  1,50 per family thecost would be  13 million, rising to  27 million at  3 per family.As against this, the Department of Health and Social Security havemade clear that they are firmly committed to the position that special FAM will be absorbed into the Child Benefits scheme, in1977; and they consider that any pressure to establish a permanentbenefit for one-parent families could be resisted... 2. &apos;        - W,CONFIDENTIAL
iii.       Alternatively, Special FAM might make it impossible tointroduce Child Benefits in 1977 at a rate of  2.16, which is the rateassumed for the public expenditure programmes recently approved bythe Cabinet.    The reason for this is that for many of the familieswhich had been receiving Special FAM in respect of the first child in1976-77 (in particular those mentioned in paragraph 3(c)), the netbenefit for the first child would be equivalent to  2.20 a week, taking account both of Special FAM after tax and clawback and of the taxallowance for a child under 11.    To prevent such families from beingworse off in cash terms in 1977-78, the initial rate of child benefit forall families would have to be at least  2. 20; but there would almost certainly be pressure for further uprating of the benefit already received by one-parent families so as to leave them no worse off in real terms.    If in consequence the rate for all families was set at 2. 50, the additional cost to public funds would be about 100 million a year.    On the other hand, it is argued that the ratecan be kept entirely open; any pressure for a higher rate than  2.16would apply with even more force in respect of the generality ofchildren who would have to wait for two years from the uprating of ordinary FAM in 1975 until the Child Benefits scheme is introduced.7. The arguments at 5i. and 6i, amount simply to a question of priorities:  should this group be helped to this extent now?    The arguments against the scheme at 6ii. and iii. amount to saying that the proposalinvolves an element of risk; but it is a matter of political judgment howserious it is.conclusion. The Cabinet are invited to decide whether or not Special FAM forone-parent families should be introduced in 1976.    For presentational and operational reasons the decision should be taken before the House resumeson 13 January.E DTreasury Chambers3 January 19753
SPECIAL FAMILY ALLOWANCEMemorandum by the Minister of State (Social Security)Department of Health and Social SecurityINTRODUCTION1.   In C(74)138 the Secretary of State for Social Services explainedbriefly why something needs to be done for one-parent families in April1976 now that the Child Benefits scheme has &quot;been postponed until April1977.   This paper sets out the case more fully.   I attach as Annex Ian outline of a Special Family Allowance scheme.THE PLIGHT OP THE ONE-PARENT FAMILY2.   On our present policies, we will he doing progressively less forfamilies each year between now and 1979 *   Family support from family allowances and Child Tax Allowances will decline up to,1977* a^d fromChild Benefits and residual Child Tax Allowances thereafter,   while wedevoted  1240 million at 1974 prices in 1974-75* we will only be devoting 910 million by 1978-79$ a. drop of 20 per cent in real terms.   Many of the poor will become steadily poorer over the periodo3.   Low-paid families with children are the key group whose poverty &apos;already stands out.   While we have done something to help parents with two or more children by raising family allowances, we have done nothing for those with only one child.   Only with great reluctance has theSecretary of State accepted the deferment of our complete Child Benefitsscheme till 1977*   This deferment has led us to try and find a relatively small but definable group of families whom we can help at modest cost.It might be argued that we should select the poorest, but this wouldinvolve further means-testing which would be intolerable.   The alterna.-tive which I propose is that we should help the category of single-parent families,,   Taken as a whole, they are not only poorer than two-parent families, but since the Finer Report, seen to be so.   I attach at Annex 2some details of their financial plight.ONE-PARENT FAMILIES IN 1976-774.   I accept that we cannot afford a Finer benefit in the near futurethough the demand for one is persistent and growing.   The TTJC have justasked to see the Secretary of State on this very subject.   If the child benefits scheme had been introduced in April 1976 it would have beenpossible, if difficult, to argue that nothing more should be done to help
one-parent families for the time beingo   But it is impossible to maintain that nothing can be done for first children in single-parent familiesuntil 197? - well over two and a half years after the Secretary of State&apos;sstatement on the publication of the Finer Report.   Further, as Annex 2 shows,these families will be adversely affected during the run-up to 1977 bythe reduction in food subsidies and higher fares, fuel prices and rents.This makes it much more difficult to justify rejection of the Finerproposals.TIMING AN AmiOuBCEMEMT5.   An announcement about the start date for the Child Benefits scheme will have to be made soon.   It \rould, in my view, be quite disastrousnot to be able to lessen the shock of the deferment by saying that we willbe making a special exception for those who are most hard-pressed - theone-parent families.   Indeed if we are to gain any credit for doi     it.we must announce it at the same time as the deferment.   Otherwise it willlook as if we have been pushed into this exception by the outcry from thevarious pressure-groups which is bound to follow the announcement of the deferment.6.   Quite apart from the political advantage of an early decision, thereare operational reasons which make it of the utmost importance to agreeour policy well before the next budget.   Every month which goes by narrowsdown options of how we could run a Special Family Allowance scheme from1976.   After the events of the past year when the whole uprating of benefitswas at risk, we must have adequate time for consultation with the staff side, for the subsequent detailed planning, for the drafting of thelegislation, for the printing of claim packs, forms and instructions andto make arrangements for accommodation and staffing.   For all these reasons, presentational and operational, it is in our view essential toreach a decision by early in the New Year when the House re-assemblesafter the Christmas recess.A SPECIAL FAMILY ALLOWANCE7.   The benefit of  1o50 a week which I am proposing for the year from april 1976 to April 1977 would go to those one-parent families who reallyneed some help.   The benefit will have to be claimed, but a very high rateof response to a benefit of this kind (non-means-tested and akin to .ordinary RAM) can. certainly be expected.   Although one-parent families on supplementary benefit or widowed mothers allowance will not gain from thismodest scheme (they are already shielded from inflation by having uprateablebenefits) it will bring a full  1.50 a week more to other poor one-parent families below the tax threshold:-(a) where the parent is in low-paid work, but not claiming FIS,though the family may have title to it;(b) where the family are living on part-time earnings and/ormaintenance but are not claiming supplementary benefit -   Finerput this number at 80,000 of whom 38,000 had title to supplementarybenefit0These families are least likely to be taking advantage of the various means-tested facilities such as free school meals and rates/rent rebate - partly because they do not have the supplementary benefit (or FIS) passports, andpartly because they evidently do not like to claim means-tested benefits at
all.   Special FAM will, admittedly, since it would be paid without a means-test, go also to the minority who are well above the tax threshold.However, after tax and &quot;claw-back&quot; these families would only be getting67p a week, not  1.50 - and they would of course be getting virtuallythe same amount in 1977 anyway when the Child Benefits scheme starts.cost.   It is because Special FAM would be so selective in its effect thatit can be introduced at a modest cost of  15million in public expenditureterms and at a net Exchequer cost of  7-g- million.   Apart from the moneyrecovered in ordinary tax and &quot;claw-back&quot; there would be a full off-set against supplementary benefit and a 50 per cent offset against FIS.Averaged over the year something like 500 staff units would be needed to run the scheme at an administrative cost of  1-g- million.   This is a broadestimate which should be adequate to cover some modest, but as yetunquantified, extra work for Revenue as well as DHSS staff costs.   So thetotal public expenditure cost would be around  I6jm and the netExchequer cost about  9m.ADMINISTRATION9.   The administrative cost is admittedly high in relation to the  benefitexpenditure.   This is inevitable.   The setting up costs of a new benefitare a once and for all exercise.   They are the same whether the benefit runsfor one year or ten.   But there are two points to bear in mind.   First, thatthe cost is for one year only (1976/77) af&quot;ter which it would be replaced by the proportionately much more modest administrative cost of Child Benefits.And secondly, the administrative costs - looked at as a separate item, andnot relative to the benefit costs which are low because the benefit is asmall one - are quite modest - and certainly a modest price to pay for post-postponing a more expensive benefit.THE REPERCUSSIONS ON THE CHILD BENEFITS SCHEME10.   At Cabinet the Chancellor expressed, the view that although the initialcost, in 1976-77* would be small, Special FAM could mean the expenditureof an extra  100m or more in 1977 because the scheme might generate pressuresto put up the level of Child Benefit as high as  2.50 a weeks   There is absolutely no reason why this should be so.11.   In April 1977 the Special Family Allowance would have to be meshed intothe general Child Benefits scheme which will replace Child Tax allowances and Family Allowances by a single benefit which effectively gives the valueof the CTA&apos;sto those poorer families who have not been able to use them before.   Just how this would be done must depend on the decision about theactual cash rate of Child Benefit which is arrived at nearer the time.   Thatdecision is dependent among other factors on what, if anything, is done byway of increases in Child Tax Allowances in any of the Budgets before april 1977; attd as the Secretary of State has made clear her position as tothe actual rate Child Benefit is fully reserved.12.   Employing the figure of  2.16 which is the flat-rate benefit in cashterms in 1977 implied in the Public Expenditure programmes recently approvedby Cabinet, the Child Benefits scheme will give an improvement to all familiesat that point in time - the biggest improvement going to the single child
family where what is paid for that child in excess of the value of the CTA is all gain.   The smallest gain will go to very large families since there isa net loss of 4P per child from the second child onwards (in those caseswhere the value of the CTAs is fully used) to set against the gain for thefirst child.   With Special FAM the single-parent families would have had their improvement a year earlier than the rest of the population.   Thiscarries with it the consequence that the minority of hetter-off singleparents paying some tax would lose at the rate of 4p per child from April 197713.   As I have pointed out, under   our Public Expenditure plan there will bea downward trend in the amount allowed for family support.   There will be, soto speak, a kink in that downward line when the improvement for the firstchild occurs in 1977*   It is certainly going to be difficult to persuadeour critics that this is all we can afford: but the problem will not be made any the more   difficult simply because we give certain people (one-parent families) their improvement a year earlier than the rest.14.   On a practical level, it seems highly improbable that the 4P a week perchild  which those within tax would lose would be identifiable.   It would bemasked by any changes in national insurance rates, the individuals earningsor changes in other items such as life insurance and mortgage repayments forwhich tax allowances are made, while the amount on the order-book in their hands would in all cases be going up from  1.50 to  2.16 per child.   Moreover,it is this group of one-parent families who in 1976 would have gained 67p(after tax and &quot;claw-back&quot;) from the new benefit only because it is not means-tested,,   They will have had a year&apos;s free ride. i l15*   In any case, it would not be the poorest families who would be affected.,There would be no loss at all for those below the tax threshold who are the families we most need to help.   Indeed, for such single-parent families therewould be a further gain in 1977s even for the first child, by moving over from  1.-50 Family Allowance to  2.16 in Child Benefit.   The gain would be upto the full amount of the difference between the two (66p) according to howfar below the tax threshold the families were and at the other extreme, thechange will not, in general, affect the incomes of those on supplementary benefit at all.   I am fully satisfied therefore that by introducing a  1.50    ,Special Family Allowance for the first child of one-parent families inApril 1976 we would in no way be pre-empting Cabinet&apos;s decision on the levelof Child Benefits to be introduced in April 1977.CONCLUSION16.   For a modest cost this benefit will bring help to some of the poorestfamilies.   It would be impossible, in my view, to announce a postponement of the main Child Benefit scheme to 1977 without making this start in 1976.The new benefit will go some way to defend us from the charge that we arefailing to shield the poorer families from the consequences  of thereduction in food subsidies, the introduction of realistic food prices, andthe general rise in the cost of living in the period before Child Benefitscome into effect.Department of Health and Social security london SE1CONFIDENTIAL4
AN OUTLINE OF THE PROPOSED SCHEMEINTRODUCTION1.     The scheme proposed will be an interim one for the year from april 1976 to April 1977, when the general Child Benefits scheme will be introduced.    Both because of its short life and because of operational constraints, the scheme will need to be as simple aspossible.    It is envisaged that the rate of benefit will be  1.50a week,  and be subject to normal income tax and to &quot;claw-back&quot;, likethe existing family allowances (which would be operationally simplestfor the Revenue).ENTITLEMENT2.     The benefit would be payable for the first, or only,  dependentchild of a one-parent family provided that:-(a) the child is living with the claimant,  and the claimantis the natural or adoptive parent&apos;(b) the claimant is not in receipt of a national insurance benefit which already carries dependency increase for thefj.rst child (e.g. sickness,  unemployment, widows benefitetc.)    This restriction is necessary because in 1977 the child Benefit for the first child (illustratively  2.16)will replace that amount of dependency benefit for thefirst child.    If,  therefore,  special FAM were paid on top of the dependency benefit in 1976 there would have to bea reduction of  1.50 in 1977*3.     There will therefore be four principal categories of recipient(a) the unmarried mother (whether or not she has maintenancepayments from the father of the child);(b) the divorced or formally separated man or woman who hasthe care of children;(c) the informally separated man or woman who has the care of children&apos;(d) the widower with children.4. It would clearly be wrong to pay benefit to an informally separatedwife (or husband) as soon as the separation took place.    This could
only encourage temporary desertion;  and in any event at the outsetit will often not be clear, even to the couple themselves whetheror not the separation is going to last days, months, or be permanent.There will therefore be a qualifying period of 3 months informalseparation before Special FAM is payable.    This&quot; is in line withFiner&apos;s approach.5.     The benefit will not be paid where a couple are living together as man and wife though not legally married,  if that man normallysupports the child for whom a claim could otherwise be made, or hasa legal liability to do so.    The pair would otherwise be put at an unfair advantage over the ordinary married couple.    The fact that the child may be supported (e.g. though a Court order against the husband and/or father) by someone outside the household will not debar the mother from getting SFA.6.      It is estimated that there are at any one time 500,000 one-parent families, (apart from widows,) of whom 100,000 are men.    Of this total233,000 are receiving supplementary benefit (including 7,000 men).7.      Special FAM like family allowance would be offset in full againstsupplementary benefit.    Only those few whose entitlement to specialFAM was more than their current rate of supplementation would gain.The amount of their gain would be the difference between the two rates,8.     A further 4-0,000 are in full-time work and receiving Family income supplement.   As special FAM would be treated as a resource in the same way as ordinary FAM the net gain for these families would only be half(less, of course, where they are liable to tax)9.      It is the remaining 225,000 who will contain the principalbeneficiaries (see para &amp; of the paper).HOW THE BENEFIT WOULD BE PAID10.      It will not be possible to pay Special FAM on the ordinary52 week FAM books because the rules for its award will be differentto those governing FAM.    A separate order-book will probably be issued for  1.50 a week.
11.   As this is an interim benefit being paid to a particularly volatilesection of the community,  there is a strong case for not attempting (evenif it were operationally feasible) to take account of changes in familystatus during the period for which an order-book is issued.    There wouldbe extremely difficult problems of &quot;linking&quot; periods of one-parentresponsibility if one did.    It may be possible to follow the FIS precedentand make an award for a set period regardless of changes of circumstances.The award would however be only for a 13 week period, with a renewalclaim included in the order-book - much shorter period than for FIS isessential because of the changing circumstances of such families espec-ially in cases of informal separation.12.    It is essential that title to these awards should not duplicatetitle to an increase of any national insurance benefit for a child (see para 2(b) above),  especially since such duplication will not occur underthe Child Benefits scheme.    Operationally it may be difficult to giveeffect to this principle in certain cases (e.g. where sickness benefit is claimed for just a few days,  and this is receiving further study.ADJUDICATION13.    It would seem quite impracticable and would prejudice the essentiallysimple nature of the SFA scheme for the benefit to come within the fulladjudication system of national, insurance officer, local Tribunal and national Insurance Commissioner.    For this ad hoc benefit with only a one year life span,  and needing a certain amount of discretion in themore &quot;difficult&apos; cases it will be right to have all decisions as Secretaryof State decisions (although there might be single right of appeal say to the local NI Appeal Tribunal).    The CB scheme itself will, of course,have a full adjudication system.
ANNEX IITHE FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF ONE-PARENT FAMILIESPART A - THEIR OVERALL SITUATION AS SEEN BY FINER1.     The Finer Committee made out a formidable case on the povertyof the one-parent family, taken as a whole.    In their Report they stated:&quot;The statistical material and the research studies we have examined overwhelmingly confirmed the general impression offinancial hardship on one-parent families which had  beennoted at the time our Committee was set up...  It has been consistently shown that, with only a few individual excep-tions, fatherless families are considerably worse offfinancially than two-parent families.    They are distinguishedparticularly by their dependence on one adult alone to providethe family&apos;s income, and handicapped by the relatively low level of earnings which mothers with children, particularlyyoung children, can achieve, mainly because of low rates of pay for women&apos;s work, but also, to a much lesser extent,because of restrictions they may have to place on the hours for which they can work.   The consequence is that a high proportion of fatherless families, particularly those with very young children, rely on supplementary benefit and have little or no other income.&quot;NUMBERS2.

FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES3.     About 40$ are on supplementary benefit, with a further 7%(38,000) living, usually on part-time earnings and maintenance, &quot;belowthe supplementary &quot;benefit level.   Of the 233,000 on supplementary benefit 173,000 are householders,  and 60,000 non-householders.EARNINGS4.     Amongst the 153,000 lone mothers in employment, 132,000 hadearnings of less than  25, 110,000 had earnings of less than  20and 68,000 had earnings of less than  15.   At the nearest comparabletime, the average earnings of men in full time manual work in manufacturing and some of the principal non-manufacturing industries were nearly  31.   At the end of 1971, whereas 85% of fatherlessfamilies in work had gross earnings of less than  25 a week, only18% of 2 Parent Families had such gross earnings.5.     Another pointer to low earnings for 1 Parent Families are thefigures of Family Income Supplements.   In October 1971 averageawards to fatherless families were  2.20 a week as against only 1.51 for 2 Parent Families.   These higher awards to 1 parent families are all the more significant because 2 Parent Familiesclaiming FIS have on average more children than 1 Parent Families.The figures for 1972 are  2.58 :  1.791973 are  2.90 :  2.38Although better off than fatherless families the motherless familiesare considerably worse off than 2 parent families.   Employmentprospects are damaged because their position discourages the fathersfrom movement to new and better paid jobs.   Also they lose earningsthrough inability to do shift work and overtime or having to works short day.MAINTENANCE6.     A Bedford College study on a 1,230 case sample of maintenanceorders payable to wives with children, live on 1 January 1966,showed the overall averaging .18.   At that time the statutory limit was  7.50 for a wife and  2.50 for each child.   No wife hadthe maximum award and only 1% had orders for  5.50 or more.7. Of all orders, 39% were in arrears - 25% for more than sixmonths. A follow up Survey in 1971 showed that,by then,no lessthan 75% of the orders which were live on 1 January 1966 and were
still live in July 1971 were more than 6 weeks in arrears; half these orders showed arrears of more than  200.8.    These findings are consistent with those of the supplementary benefits Commission in June 1970 which were that of the lone mothersin receipt of Supplementary Benefit who had maintenance orders, 95%with one child had an order of  3 a week or less,  and 34% of those with  children an order of  5 or less.    Only a-5% of the orders live werecomplied with regularly (to the extent of 75% or more of the amount due).HOUSING9.     Lone mothers,(and to a lesser extent lone fathers)  are much less likely to be owner occupiers than two-parent families.    FES data showsof 280,000 lone mothers, other than widows, only 17% are owner occupierscompared with a national figure for all families of about 50%.10.    At the other extreme,  fatherless families account for a disproportionate-tionately high percentage of those living in furnished accommodation.The Francis Committee found,  in 1970,  that in London fatherless familiesaccounted for 51% of furnished tenants with children in distress areas,and 21% in the conurbation as a whole.B - THEIR PROSPECTIVE situation.      Over the next 2 years there will undoubtedly be a further substantialrise in the cost of living.    The one-parent family on supplementary benefit is to some extent shielded from its effects.    Not only will thebenefits rates go up, but supplementary benefit (and FIS) are &quot;passports&quot;to free school meals and other, fringe benefits.2.      The position of the family not getting such social security benefitsis more exposed.    Admittedly the lone mother who is out at work can expect higher earnings which to some extent will ease the financial problem.    But the single mother is often at a disadvantage because of a restriction she has to place on the kind of work she can do and the hoursshe can be away from home.    Consequently, she will often be in low-paidwork and often also in a poor position to argue for substantial wage increases.
3.     Again, many of these families will have title to free school meals -but take-up is unlikely to reach the same level as for those on supple-mentary benefit when the individual has (unlike the supplementary benefitrecipient) both to know the level at which she would be entitled,  and tomake a declaration of income to the local education authority.    It isalso true that the poor can claim rent and rate rebates.    But as indicated,a disproportionate number of one-parent families occupy furnished accom-modation, where the proportion of tenants eligible for rebates whoactually claim them is much lower than for tenants in local authorityaccommodation, or even private unfurnished accommodation.4.      Insofar as one-parent families do not avail themselves of the means-tested benefits mentioned above, or are just outside their scope, theywill certainly be hard hit as a result of the cut in fuel a food subsidies and the increase in school meal charges.    Taking such a family with two children at school:-(a) the April 1975 and September 1976 increases in schoolmeal charges will add 60p per week during term-time:(b) over the two years, 197-4-75 to 1976-77, the value ofthe food subsidy for a one-parent two-child familywill have been reduced by something like 15p:(c) the reduction in the fuel subsidy is likely to meanextra expense for such a family of 35p to 40p a week.Such families therefore - and directly as a result of Government policy -can expect to have extra expenses of about  1  a week (even if one averagesover the whole year the term time extra expenditure on school meals).

I&apos;(confidential)ANNEX  I JTHE PROPOSED  SPECIAL FAMILY ALLOWANCE ANDGENERAL  POLICY  FOR FAMILY SUPPORTOfficial note by the Treasury and  Inland RevenueThe Committee has  to  consider the proposal  that family allowances at  the rate of  1.50 a week  should be  extended  tothe first  children of single-parent families in April   1976;that  this  arrangement would  run for   12 months only;   and  that from April  1977 the Special Family, Allowance would cease andbe absorbed into the general  system of Child Benefits  (CDs)at the levels of benefit which it is now planned to introduceat that date.    If this were the end of the story,  the onlyissue would be the additional  expenditure of  16-j millioninvolved  for  1976-77 alone;   and  this could no doubt be accomodated without  too much difficulty if the Cabinet accordedpriority  to  it.    The  story  is,  however,   a good deal more  complex.2.       It  is necessary in the  first  instance to  examine  carefully the arguments  concerning a Special Family Allowance in itself.Second,   and  still more important,   the question must be considered whether the introduction of a special benefit for single-parent families would lead to a major increase in the cost of child benefits when they are introduced,  and the wider implications if that were to happen.3- These questions are discussed separately below. It may,however, be helpful in the first instance to describe briefly the general background.General Background4.      The Government&apos;s policy concerning support  for families isone of providing Child Benefits of universal application to allfamilies with children.    The main new  element will be theextension of FAM to the first children of all families.    UniversalChild Benefits will,  however,  incorporate a selective  elementaccording to income,   in favour of the poorest families,  by extending the value of Child Tax Allowances to those who get no value from them now because they pay no income tax.     &quot;The poor&quot;for this purpose are thus defined by reference to  income taxthresholds;   and selectivity according to income under this policy,both for the poor and  the not-so-poor,  will depend  solely on the1
(confidential)operation  of the general   system of income tax.    At  the  sametime,   the Child  Benefits will replace in whole or part   existingmeans-tested benefits  in respect  of children of families who receive the latter.5-       The  effect  is,   in sum,   that   (as with the  1975  increase  inFAM)   the great majority of poor  families,  who already drawmeans-tested benefits,  will  gain little or no advantage;   thosefamilies with incomes below  the tax threshold who  for whateverreason do not  claim means-tested benefits will gain  substantially;and  the great majority of all  families who do pay tax will gainbut by declining net  amounts as  their  incomes bring them intohigher rates of tax.     A system of universal  application  such as this,   the major part  of the  cost  of which represents a gain tobetter-off families,   is inevitably expensive;     it  is necessaryto avoid making it more expensive still.The proposed Special  Family Allowance6.       The first  question concerning this proposal  is whether itwould be realistic to  expect that, having committed ourselves in principle to a special benefit for single-parent families,the resulting pressures could be resisted for a specialdifferential benefit for these families to be provided in perpetuity on top of the general  system of Child Benefits.    this seems doubtful,   (unless Child Benefits were to be set at a much higher rate and at a very much higher cost than the Cabinet haveendorsed).7.      As for the merits of the case concerning single-parent families,   the evidence certainly suggests that many such familiesare among the poorest,  and that  single-parent families are relatively very dependent on means-tested benefits.    These factswere known before decisions were taken to give greater priority to proposals for improvements in social security,  includingincreased FAM and general Child Benefits,  other than a specialbenefit for single-parent  families.    In any case,  by no means allsingle-parent  families are poor;     and  the poorest  families include a number of two-parent  families.     But many of the poorest of bothcategories will benefit from improvements already planned.    Outof about  85,000 families with more than one child who will receivethe maximum additional net  benefit  from the  1975 increase in FAM,single-parent  families account for 40,000;     and the maximum benefit from the introduction of Child Benefits in 1977 will goto a total of about  150,000 families,  of which about 655000 aresingle-parent  families.Wider implications for the cost of Child Benefits generally8.       The further question must be considered whether theintroduction of a special benefit for single-parent familieswould have the effect of increasing the cost of the universalbenefit itself,  and of doing so in a way which would  seriously prejudice the pursuit of other major policies.(confidential)
(confidential)9.       The risk  that   it would do  so arises  primarily  because ofthe implications  for uprating of  the benefits  concerned.     Aspecial  benefit  for a particular group of people such as  single-parent  families would naturally be  expected  to  be regularlyuprated  in line with prices  at  least.     Hut  serious  consequences would  follow  if any  such  commitment were adopted  for upratingof the general  Child  Benefits.10.     The integration of cash benefits  and  tax allowances,   whichis  fundamental  to  the  intended  system of Child  benefits,  hasimportant  consequences  for fiscal  policy as well  as  social policy.     In particular,   the necessary  flexibility  for purposesof economic management which has hitherto been  available inthe determination of Child Tax Allowances must  be imported  intothe new benefits  system.     In other words,   policy  towards upratingthese universal benefits must be governed  far more by  considerations of  economic management  than would be the  case for a selectivebenefit;     and  the greatest  possible flexibility must  thereforebe retained  in policy towards uprating  of Child Benefits.11.     The foregoing considerations are  explained more fully inthe Annex,  which also  explains  the basis  of calculation,   includingthe assumptions concerning upratings,  of the planned provisionfor the cost  of Child Benefits which was  incorporated  in theChancellor&apos;s proposals  for public  expenditure which the Cabinetaccepted  on 25 November.12.     The main argument against  introducing a special benefit  for single-parent  families in  1976  is  that  it would run a  serious risk of prejudicing uprating policy towards Child Benefits,   inthe first  instance by making it politically impossible tointroduce Child Benefits at a rate of  2.16 in 1977 -  ie withinthe total net Exchequer  cost  of  120 million  (inclusive of thecost of the  1975 increase in FAM)  at  197^ Survey prices whichhas been allowed  for in the Cabinet 1s decisions  for forward planning of public  expenditure.13-     If one-parent  families received a Family Allowance of  1.50for first  children in  1976?   some of them would  then be enjoyinga net benefit  for the first  child  equivalent  to  2.20 a weektaking account both of FAM after tax and  clawback and  of the tax allowance for a child under  11.    Having  singled  out  this group as  specially needing  a new benefit  in advance of child benefits generally,  would it be defensible to give that groupless in real terms in  1977?    In other words,  if the supportthese families had  received  in  1976 had  to be fully uprated  in1977 in line at least with price increases,  a Child Benefitrate for  single-parent  families of something like  2.50 a week would be implied.     (If, however,   single-parent families continueto receive in  1977 no more in cash terms than in 1976,  implyinga general Child Benefit of  2.20,  then this would itself addabout  16 million a year to planned  expenditure.    But it wouldalso imply that  some single-parent families would be demonstrablyworse off in real terms in  1977 than in 1976).     If, however,  thelevel of Child Benefits generally were set at  2*50,  corresponding to an uprated value of the support received.by single-parent(confidential)
(confidential)families after the introduction of  the Special  Family allowance in   1976,   the net Exchequer cost  of Child  Benefits would beincreased by over  100 million above  the provision in public expenditure plans.lk.     Especially given that DHSS Ministers have  suggested  thatthe Government will  in any  event be strongly pressed  to accepta  statutory commitment  to  regular reviews of the rate of child benefits,   it  seems doubtful whether it would be possible inthese circumstances  to avoid  thus increasing the cost  of these benefits,   and  of incurring  the no less  objectionable consequences for  economic management.15-   Wfe do not  think that we  should  embark  on action which would run the risk of incurring  these consequences.HM TREASURYLondon SWl13 December  197^(confidential)
ANNEXFAMILY support .     The policies to which the Government are committed (an increase,subject only to normal tax, in family allowances, and a subsequentmove to family endowment) involve three main strands in the way inwhich the Stato now takes account of family responsibilities (apartfrom benefits :?or special categories such as widows).    First, thereare child tax allowances, which are part of the graduation of incometax, and reflect the fact that a taxpayer with a child or children hasa smaller taxable capacity than a childless taxpayer.    Second, thereare family allowances, which are universal cash payments for childrenirrespective o.r income or personal circumstances.   Third, there arethose social security benefits (eis supplementary benefits and FIS)which are desired to reflect individual needs.   The government&apos;s policy is to increase the importance of the second element, relative to the first end third.The effect of higher family allowances and child benefits on familyincomes2.     The increase in April 1975 in the family allowance (FAM) for second and subsequent children will give across-the-board help tofamilies with two or more children with the largest benefit going tobig families.   Help will go to those who pay tax, as well as those who do not (since there will this tine be no &quot;clawback&quot; of the addition,as there was in 1968, from taxpayers).   But the fact that the increase will be liable to income tax will impose a significant element ofselectivity within the system.   Tie point below which the increase will be received in full - the poverty line for this purpose - will thus be related to tax threshold?;.   But the increase in FAM will be offset against existing social security payments (eg SB)   and sincethe great majority of those with incomes below the tax thresholdapplicable to their family circut stances will be receiving such existingbenefits, they will gain little or nothing.   The net benefit tofamilies will thus accrue largely to those with incomes from around the tax threshold upwards, except that higher rate taxpayers above acertain point (depending on family size and income level) will as nowreceive no net benefit, and will be better off if they disclaim family allowances entirely.confidential
3.     The later move to a system of universal child benefits (cbs.), paidin cash and free-of-tax, will take the process further by extending the payment to cover all children, and increasing its amount so thatit represents all or most of the value at the basic rate of the childtax allowance.   This further move will favour small families, andparticularly one-child families who will effectively receive a benefitof the family allowance type for the first time.   How far the change will involve a further redistribution towards families as a wholedepends on the size of child benefits that can be1afforded.4.     Because the new child benefit scheme will be superimposed on theexisting system of social security the cash gain to families with children will vary widely with income, family circumstances andeligibility and take-up of existing benefits.5.     The main cost of the scheme will arise from the extension (in whole or in part) of family allowances to first and only children.   Onthe basis of the planning figures adopted for public expenditure whichallows for a CB rate of  2.16 a week in 1977j this will give a twochild family paying basic rate tax a cash gain of 60p or about 16% ofthe net   value of family allowances and child tax allowances in 1975-76.   These net gains will be reduced by 4p for each additional childsince the CB rate of  2.16 would be 4p less than the net value of thepresent tax allowance for a child under 11 and family allowance at 1*50 for which children after the first will be eligible from nextThese figuresApril./take account of the extra tax which the husband will pay whenchild tax allowances are absorbed into child benefits - see paragraph 9below .Ij6.     Considerably larger net cash gains would go to the minority of families below the tax threshold who do not at present receive other social security benefits.   This would apply to less than 20% of suchfamilies (about 150,000).   The maximum cash gain for a two child   1family in this small group would be  2.82 a week, but only families with incomes so far below the tax threshold that they do not use the child tax allowances at all at present would get as much as this.confidential
7-     As with the FAM increase, however, over 80% of the families atpresent below the threshold would get little or no cash gain whenchild benefits are introduced, since the other social security benefitthey already receive would be simultaneously reduced by amounts whichlargely or wholly offset  ;he value of the cbs..   The offset would be complete for the 52% of such families on supplementary benefit and the21% receiving short-term national insurance benefits.   For the 7% ofsuch families receiving family income supplement the offset might be only 50%.8.     Thus from the point of view of income distribution betweenfamilies the child benefit scheme with the rate set at  2.16 wouldmean:(a) a general increase in child support: the extension ofFAM for the first child would give a cash gain to all families(the size of the gain would decrease - by 4-p a child per week -with the size of family)(b) a minority of the poorest below the tax threshold would gain substantially ie those who are not already drawing other social security benefits.(c) most families below the tax threshold would substitutechild       benefits for     means tested or other benefits with little or no net gain in family income.The effect of child benefits on the take home pay of fathers9.     Child benefits will be paid to mothers: fathers&apos; take home paywill be lower than it otherwise would be since their tax thresholdswill be lower as a result of the abolition or drastic curtailment of child tax allowances.   This would be a big extension of what alreadyhappens to fathers of children eligible for FAM since both clawbackand ordinary tax represents offsets to the value of child taxallowance.   For example the effective tax allowance for a child under11 eligible for FAM will not be at the present rate of  240 a yearbut only  110.   On the assumptioas that the rates of tax and childCONFIDENTIAL
allowances were those in force for 1974-75, that family allowances hadbeen in payment at the April 1975 rate of  1.50 a week, and thatresidual CTAs were retained, the tax threshold of a father of twodependent children would fall when child benefits were introduced byabout  350 so that he would pay  2.22 a week in extra tax (and 70p aweek for each additional dependent child).   His wife would get anincrease in weekly benefits of that amount plus the 60p mentioned inparagraph 5 above.   It is difficult to foresee what impact thereduction in the pay packet, as distinct from family disposable income,would have on wage claims and settlements.   Much would depend on otherpersonal tax allowances as well as recent experience of real personaldisposable income.   But there is clearly a risk that the reduction intax allowances, which families with children would experience at thesame time in April of the year in which CB was first paid, could comeat an awkward time and add to the normal pressure for higher wages.Fiscal policy10.   The replacement of child tax allowances (CTAs) and FAM by childcash benefits will have important implications for fiscal policy.   Atpresent a decision to change CTAs (and the other personal tax allowances) depends on a variety of considerations, including demand management, counter-inflation policy, equity and administrative convenience, and is taken in the light of the Budget judgement as awhole.   In some years no change is made in the tax allowances eventhough their real value may have fallen over a preceding period (andthe same is tu/be of FAM).   When child cash benefits are introduced itcan be assumed that there will be heavy pressure to raise them atleast in line with prices, even though their level may be decided ina budgetary context and without any commitment as to the timing ofupratings or the basis for them.   There is a strong presumption there-fore that the Chancellor&apos;s budgetary flexibility will be significantly reduced.   For example, a decision to uprate child cash benefits,assuming for illustrative purposes a benefit of  2.16 and a rate of inflation of, say 10 per cent,would cost about  150 million,equivalentto the yield of about - p in the basic rate of income tax.   Additionalstrain will also be put on the tax system to finance public expenditure.   This is particularly important, given the Government1sCONFIDENTIAL4
intention to raise public expenditure over the period to the late 1970sat a rate significantly faster than the growth of total resources available for public expenditure and private consumption combinedwhich implies an appreciable increase in the burden of taxation inany event.The basis of tae planning figures agreed in the Public ExpenditureReview11.   The agreed planning basis was that child benefits would beintroduced in 1977 at a rate of  2.16 per child per week.12.   This rate reflected the need to limit the additional cost of theExchequer at tie point of introducing the scheme in the following ways:(a) residual child tax allowances for children over 11 wouldbe retained, so avoiding giving parents of younger children the same benefits that older children now get.(b) despite the cash gains for the family as a whole (seeparagraph 5) *. the rate is a little less in cash terms thanthe combined value to the basic rate taxpayer of the presentchild tax allowance for children under 11 and of FAM at 1.50 payable for second and later children.13.   Conventional assumptions were adopted about uprating.   No allowance was made for increases in child tax allowances in 1975-76 or 1976-77or for increasing FAM in 1976-77-   After the introduction of child benefits in 1977 j however, it was assumed that the rate would beincreased at half the rate of inc rease in prices.14.   Every increase of 10% in child tax allowances in the period before1977 costs about  120 million at 1974-75 income levels in terms of netexchequer cost and will increase public expenditure correspondinglywhen cbs. are introduced.   An increase in FAM would also raise thecost of cbs..   A further FAM increase of 50p would itself cost theExchequer some  100m, and if cbs. were fixed at a rate which would givethe first child the full benefit the additional increase in the costof cbs. would be a further  ioOm.   These costs are in money terms.
