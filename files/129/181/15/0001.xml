REFERENDUM: CENTRALISED COUNTNote by the Lord President of the council. At their meeting on 23 January the Cabinet asked me to circulate amemorandum on the feasibility of a centralised count (CC(75) 5th conclusions minute 6).2. The Annex contains a note by the Home Office on this which is summarised in paragraph 20.    The main conclusion is that a central countwould be feasible but hazardous.    I understand that the cost would be of theorder of  0.5 million.3. In my view and, I think, that of my colleagues the decisiveconsiderations are political rather than technical.4.        It is essential that we should reach a very early decision, not onlyto enable work to proceed on the drafting of the relevant section of theWhite Paper but also so that planning, whether for a central count or forsome other procedure, can be put in hand.E privy Council Office3 February 1975C(75) 15 COPY NO      813 February 1975CABINET
annex note by the Home Office &apos; &apos;;;INTRODUCTIONThis paper examines in more detail the feasibility of the scheme for a central count outlined in the Annex to C(75)9j particularly in respectof transport and the organisation of the count itself.   It is clear, on paper at least, that such an operation could be organised.   But a numberof uncertainties remain, such as the degree of security risk which must beguarded against, the strain on resources and other work - and hence thecost involve - and the likelihood of obtaining the necessary staff.   these could only be resolved by setting in train the actual planning;   the timetable suggests that, if planning is not started very soon the option of a centralised count will no longer remain open;   alternatively, that tokeep the option open, planning would have to begin, and expenditure be incurred, as though the choice had been made.   Even then, it must be emphasised that a doubt is bound to remain about the number of staff whowill, turn up on the day and that this, together with the inevitableorganisational problems of an operation of this scale unprecedented andtotally unrehearsed, and liable to a variety of unpredictable hazards,ranging from deliberate sabotage to pure mischance, might not only falsifyany estimates or the time needed to complete the count but could conceivablynullify the whole operation.TRANSPORT - -2.   At the close of the poll the ballot boxes will be in polling stations in the charge of presiding officers.   The latter will also have thestatement of the number of ballot papers issued to them, the number of papers spoilt or unused, and those unaccounted for, ie, the number whichshould be in the boxes.   These individual statements will have to becollated by the local returning officer.   The first step in each area,therefore, will be to bring together the ballot boxes and accompanyingstatements in the normal way.   This, and the provision of transport forthe purpose, will be the responsibility of the local returning officer.Once assembled, the returning officer will collate the statements,, seal the boxes, and ensure that they are accompanied by the necessarydocuments. 1
( CONFIDENTIAL )3.   The places of assembly might be affected to some extent by considerations of convenience for forwarding to London.   The number of places, however,would be likely to be of the order of 500 or so.4&apos;   There would be great advantage in placing the main transport responsibility in the hands of the Post Office and preliminary enquiry suggests that thePost Office might be able to undertake the task.   They would be likely touse a combination of road, rail and air.   They would pick up consignmentsfrom local returning officers and deliver them to the premises to, be usedfor the count in London.   The consignments ought normally to be ready forcollection by midnight on polling day.   Those from London and nearby could be assembled at the counting centre in time for work to start the next morning.Consignments from outlying areas ought to be delivered by midday of thesecond day following polling day.   To meet such a timetable, British Hailwould probably have to put on some special trains.I . - -5.   The volume of the consignments would be considerable - 50*000 ballotboxes would have to be handled.   The Northern Ireland consignment alone would be likely to occupy two 40&apos; freight containers.   The main deliveries,which would arrive at various London terminals, might occupy 200-400vanloads, depending on how fully the flow would enable vans to be loaded.The post Office would expect that the work would not interfere with carriage of the ordinary mails.   At this stage, however, they cannot estimate theresources which would be needed.PREMISES -6.   The size and character of the operation calls for large open space.The area needed depends to some extent on the time in which the work must becompleted and hence the number of staff employed.   Ideally a single site is called for.   This would simplify the operation.   Of the sites in London, EarlsCourt is large enough to accommodate any practicable operation.   It hasaccess and handling facilities and catering could be arranged.&apos;   It is available during June and up to 5 July.   The rent would be about  5,000 a day.It is not, however, available at any later date in the year.   Accordingly, ifthe timetable slipped for any reason the only alternative&quot; would be to use a combination of probably six or more smaller halls, which would multiplythe traffic and handling problems.   Even if they could all be secured forthe same date, the division of the work in this way would be bound to adda day or more to the work.   It would^in particular complicate the * shuffling&apos;-jprocess referred to in 7 below.,2
QoNRDENjiAr)STAFF7.   Three phases of work are involved.   When the ballot boxes have been checked in, the first phase, analagous to that in an election, is to reconcile the number of ballot papers in eaxh box, with the presidingofficer&apos;s statements.   The boxes will have to be emptied so that the paperscan be unfolded, each checked for the official mark, the total number of papers in each box counted, and the papers bundled in, say, fifties.   1-Tex.tcomes the Shuffling&apos; phase.   The bundles would be stacked in such a way thatthe contents of each stack came from all parts of the UK.   The boxeswill be arriving throughout the first day and the morning of the second.All available staff would be used to complete these 2 phases of the operation.The next phase would be to sort the bundled papers into Yes&apos;s and l\ToTs andto count the two totals.   The third phase might have to be extended bya recount in the event of a close result, or the emergence of some seriousdiscrepancy or.some similar factor.8.   A number of aspects of the work are quite different from the count atan ordinary election.   For this reason, and because of the scale of theoperation, it is impossible to do more than make estimates of the time and numbers needed for the various phases.   The timing of the first phase is partly dictated by the arrival of the ballot boxes.   Each box is likely to contain an average of 600 ballot papers.   It seems reasonable to assume thatone person could handle ten boxfuls, totalling 6000 papers, in two days.This implies a basic staff of about 5,000.   The next phase cannot begin untilthe contents of the last arrivals - which will all be from outlying areas -have been distributed between the various stacks.   The count proper, therefore,would start on the morning of the third day.   A staff of 5,000 should beable to scrutinise, sort and count 30,000,000 ballot papers in about 2 fullworking days.   Any recount, however, would be likely to occupy a furtherday or so.9.   It looks, therefore, as though the basic requirement will be for aclerical staff of about 5000.   This will need to be supplemented by adirecting staff who will be responsible for instructing the basic staff intheir duties and in supervising all stages of the operation to ensure thatthe rules are scrupulously observed and an even flow of work maintained.Even with comprehensive advanced planning it seems likely th?.t a directingstaff of at least 250 vail be needed and a considerably larger number mightbe called for.- In addition a manual staff to handle the boxes and bundleswill be needecf, amounting to perhaps another 50 or 100.CONFI DENJi ALj
10.   It would not &quot;be practicable to undertake any effective rehearsal ofthis operation.   The estimates given assume that the work would flow reasonably smoothly under the guidance of the directing staff.     Thereis, however, no experience of running an operation of this size to a tight&apos;timetable, and it is difficult to foresee what delays might arise becauseof various handling problems.   It is possible that the availability of larger numbers might afford some safeguard against unforeseen delays in -themain sorting and counting phase..   But the larger the numbers, the greater theproblem of organisation would be.   The best course, therefore, would seem tobe to aim for the numbers proposed above. &apos;/11.   The staff employed must be of proven personal reliability.   Thissuggests that it will be necessary that the supervisory staff, at least,should be drawn from the civil service.   These would need to come from theexecutive and higher executive grades.   It would also be desirable for as many as possible of the clerical staff to come from the civil service.But 5j000 represents nearly 10/i of all clerical staff in London, a great many of whom are in local offices.   If Departments have to divert staffin these numbers for a whole week - or longer if any recounting is necessary -this could only be achieved at the expense of serious interference withordinary government business.   There is no precedent since the war on which .to base any estimate of this.   Any shortfall could only be made good from local government staff in London or from casual recruitment.   Local governmentare likely to be in the same difficulties.   They may be able to&apos;provide somestaff but it seems only realistic to assume that casual recruitment wouldalso be called for.   The proposed date is in term time so teachers and students (who provide help for the Post Office at Christmas) would not beavailable.     Ixi addition it would be essential, in view of the character ofthe work and the reason for a centralised count, to take up references andscrutinise applicants with great care.   This would mean starting recruitmentperhaps 3 months in advance.TIME12.   It must be recognised that the staff requirements for this work aresubstantialand represent the greatest single hurdle.   The provision of adequate staff is a factor&apos; on which the success of the operation will t\irn.It would not appear until recruiting was begun, what success could be achievein obtaining suitable staff from outside, what deficiencies would have to be* . - -   - . &apos; ..........    : -, ; f.-,..; 4.,,0 :;.v::    &apos;     .. !fe.   .;-. ,   -    &apos;      : ^ \X CONFIDE NT! feared)   &apos;   ; .
CONFIDENT IAmade up from Departments, and whether these could be achieved by volunteersor by drafting.   This in turn will have a bearing on the efficiency of thework, much of which will be tedious and monotonous and may involve longhours (some assessment will have to be made of the length of time that a per so:-i can be continously occupied in counting;   it might not be many hours andshifts would have to be considered).   If staff have to be coerced in any waythis will affect the accuracy of the work, time taken to do it thereliability of attendance and the readiness to work long hours or at weekends.   These uncertainties make it difficult to assess the time needed forthe work with any accuracy.13.   The time needed for a centralised count is partly dictated by the initial transport factor and the need to complete the first two phases, includingthe *shuffling&apos; of the papers before going on to the third.     The thirdcannot begin until the third day after polling day and is likely to last for a minimum of two days with a possibility of taking substantially longer.That is, including polling day (but excluding the possibility of a recount) thetime will be at least 5 working days and&apos; could be up to 7&apos;14.   This timetable has a bearing on the day of the week for polling day.The traditional day, Thursday, would be almost the worst.   The weekendwould then interrupt the first phase of the count.   It seems improbable that staff in any numbers would be prepared to work over the weekend andthis would extend the first phase by 2 days.   Polling on a Friday couldmean that transport would get caught in weekend schedules and impose afurther delay.   Polling at the weekend itself would leave the maximumworking time for the count, but would involve very serious problems inobtaining staff to man polling stations and ought to be avoided for thisreason. .15.   The most practicable course would seem to be to poll on a Ifonday,giving 4 working days afterwards.   The count might well not be finished inthat time but the back of the work ought to have been broken and staff might then have become sufficiently committed to be ready to volunteer to work through the weekend to finish the job.D
SECURITY16.   Further study, particularly of the transport aspect, exposes that boxes,either singly or in groups will be at risk at various stages.   The degree ofthis risk cannot be assessed at this stage, but it will be greater thefarther boxes have to be carried and the longer the count takes.   It is    &apos;impossible to provide 100/b security;  .the question vd.ll.be what degree ofrisk can be tolerated and this can only be judged in the light of the latestintelligence nearer the time.   The best that can be said is that aconsiderable strain would be put on all police forces, particularly theBritish Transport Commission Police and the Metropolitan Police.17.   Prom the other aspect, the secrecy of regional figures, 10Cj  securitycannot be guaranteed here either.   It would almost certainly be necessaryto incorporate provisions for putting staff under obligations of secrecy.The main safeguard would be the physical jumbling of papers.   But welsh language papers cannot be concealed in this way,, and the very procedures whichmay be needed to ensure the accuracy of the count, such as the maintenance of running tallies as is customary with an ordinary election, would facilitate the surreptitious recording of, for example, Welsh figures (with 5*000counters, each counter would be likely to handle 500 Welsh votes).   Carewould also have to be taken at the first, reconliation, stage to concealthe provenance of each ballot box.   The press and television are likely to  .be waiting to greet individual counters (whom it would be impracticable tokeep incommunicado for the period of the count) and there could be no guarantee that unauthorised disclosures of one kind or another would notgain a good deal of currency.ORGANISATION AND LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY18.   The planning of the operation would call for a central planning unitneeding perhaps twenty or so staff.   Responsibility would also need to beplaced firmly on an individual (a kind of Returning Officer General), whoseduties would have to be spelt out in the legislation.   Although this could be
done broadly in terms of the ordinary electoral practice there arefeatures of a centralised count which are significantly different andas to which special provision would be needed.   The importance of these duties would seem to make it unavoidable that this provision should beincluded in the Bill itself.   Even if it were relegated to an Order detail:would have to be made available and this would give the opportunity foramendments, based on the order, to be tabled to the Bill.   There would,therefore, inevitably be considerable debate about the scheme, not onlyon Second Reading but also in Committee.CONCLUSION19&apos;   This study shows that a centralised count is feasible, but is subjectto hazards, the most likely effect of which would be, if things went wrong,to lengthen the time needed.   The cost of the operation would be considerable, not only in simple financial terms but also in the repercussions on other work and services which might be affected.Arrangements - could, and would have to, be made to conceal the source of ballot papers, but it would be impossible to guarantee that therewould be no leakage of information, particularly in respect of voting inKales.SUMMARY20. (i)   A centralised count is feasible but hazardous (paragraph 1).(ii)   Very extensive transport arrangements would be necessary(paragraphs 2-5)&apos;(iii)   Earls Court is the only suitable building in London.   Itis free during June and up to 5 July but not at any laterperiod in the year (paragraph&apos;6).(iv) 5,000 clerical staff, a directing staff of 250 and 50-100manual staff would be needed (paragraphs 7 - 11).(v)   The count would requite at least 5 working days includingPolling Day and perhaps 7.   This does not allow for arecount.   If the Poll were on a Ilonday the result might beavailable on the Friday evening (paragraphs 12 - 15)*(vi)   Absolute security at all stages could not be guaranteed(paragraphs 16 - 17).
