C(75) 19 COPY NO        gj17 February 1975CABINETREFERENDUM: DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Lord President of the council. I attach a draft of the White Paper on the referendum.    The presenttimetable provides for publication on 26 February;  a debate in the commons on 6 March or, failing that, early in the week beginning 10 March;publication of the Referendum Bill on 27 March; and Second Reading in the commons as soon as possible after the Easter Recess.2.        The draft takes account of our discussions in Cabinet on21 and 23 January and 6 and 11 February; my own two papers on theinformation activities of outside organisations and the Question on the ballot paper (C(75) 17 and 18);  comments on earlier drafts of the White Paper fromthe Departments mainly concerned; and views so far expressed by thepolitical Parties, the Trades Union Congress and the main outside bodies ieBritain in Europe and the National Referendum Campaign,3, On many issues the draft is in terms of our suggestions rather than our decisions.    This is in accordance with our undertaking to listen to allthe arguments before reaching final conclusions.    I should however draw attention to passages in which, following our discussions so far, important and possibly controversial proposals by the Government are announced:-Chapter 2, paragraph 4No requirement for minimum poll or more than a simple majority(CC(75) 5th Conclusions, Minute 6).Chapter 3, paragraph 2Right to vote similar to Parliamentary elections ie no extension ofexisting register, except to peers.Chapter 3, paragraph 11Votes to be counted centrally (CC(75) 7th Conclusions, Minute 3).
2No limit on total expenditure by the two sides(CC(75) 5th Conclusions, Minute 6).4.        I should also draw attention to those passages where, following theCabinet&apos;s discussion on 11 February, there are alternative versions on questions which we have not yet resolved (CC(75) 8th Conclusions^Minute 3):-Chapter 2, paragraph 0 &quot;JThe wording on the ballot paper is discussed in C(75) 18, and I have offered three alternative versions.Chapter 4, paragraphs 2-7Various views on Government information were expressed in cabinet on 11 February (CC(75) 8th Conclusions, Minute 3).    Butthere was a measure of agreement that we should circulate both a popular version of the White Paper on the new terms and theGovernment^ recommendation and an explanation of the referendumarrangements.    There was also support for the proposal in thereport attached to C(75) 16 that there should be a special unit to dealwith requests for information.    I have offered four alternativeversions of paragraphs 4.2-4.6,    The four versions have in commonthe White Paper, a popular version of it and an explanation of the referendum.    Beyond that they add respectively:-Version A - NothingVersion B - A factual pamphletVersion C - Statements of opposite points of view-Version D - Both a factual pamphlet and statements ofopposite points of viewChapter 4, paragraphs 12 and 14In dealing with the activities of outside bodies I have generallyfollowed the line that I proposed in C(75) 17, but there arealternative passages which will enable the Cabinet to considerwhether there should be a return of expenditure and restrictions onadvertising.
5. The White Paper does not specify a date for the referendum, whichmust depend on the progress of renegotiation: but with a central count aMonday would secure the speediest result.    Wakes Weeks begin in thesecond half of June, but on 23 June (the first practicable Monday) onlyOldham and Rochdale will be on holiday.    By 30 June they will be joined bya dozen other Lancashire towns.conclusion.        I invite the Cabinet to settle the terms of the White Paper to bepublished on 26 February.E privy Council Office17 February 19753
REFERENDUM ON UNITED kingdom membership OP THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITYPREFACEThis White Paper is about the organisation of the national referendum onthe United Kingdom&apos;s membership of the European Community.2.   The referendum is to be held because of the unique nature of the issue, whichhas fundamental implications for the future of this country, for the politicalrelationship between the United Kingdom and the other Member Governments of theCommunity, and for the constitutional position of Parliament.3.   The organisation of the referendum must be efficient and fair.   Some special arrangements will be necessary, as set out in this White Paper.   But xrtiereverappropriate, the Government will use the well-tried machinery which serves for parliamentary elections.   Thus advantage will be taken of procedures and safeguards which long experience has shown to be effective, and which are familiar to thevoters.A&apos;   The political parties represented in Parliament and leading organisationscampaigning both for c continued membership and for our leaving the Communityhave been consulted; the experience of other countries has also been considered.The Government will pay careful attention to reaction to this White Paper bothin Parliament and outside.
- 2 -1. INTRODUCTIONOn 23 January, the Prime.Minister.announced to the House.ofCommons that, once the.outcome of the renegotiation, of the. terms of membership was known, a referendum would be held on whether the United -Kingdom should continue as a member of the European Community or should,withdraw.   (The full statement is at Annex A).1.2      When the outcome of renegotiation is known the Government will decide upon their own recommendation to the country, whether for continued membership of the Community on the basis of the renegotiatedterms or for withdrawal.   The present White Paper is concerned only withthe organisation of the referendum ie the organisation of the poll, theprovision of information to the xvoters and the scope of the legislation required.1.3      The Government have studied the experience of other countries, withparticular reference to those such as Australia and New Zealand with political systems closely related to ours and to the referenda on entry into the European Community held by Denmark, the Republic of Irelandand Norway in 1972.    (Annex B summarises the practice in a number of countries)1.4      The period of further uncertainty over our membership of theCommunity should be kept as short as possible in our own interests andthose of other Community Governments.   In his statement on 23 January,the Prime Minister said that, &quot;Provided the outcome of renegotiation isknown in time, we intend to hold the referendum before the summer/holidays
- 3 -holidays, which means in practice not later than the end of June&quot;.   he went on to say that the; Government proposed to introduce the necessary legislation around Easter time with a view to securing Royal Assentbefore the end of Kay.   If the referendum is to be held before the summer holidays, it will be essential to complete the renegotiation andto prepare legislation in accordance with that timetable.
- 4 -2.     THE POLL AND THE QUESTION &apos;2.1      The Governmenfs general approach to the organisation of the referendum is that the familiar procedures and practices applied to normalUnited Kingdom elections should be used as far as possible.   The sameapproach applies to the more general questions of the size of the polland of the majority required to provide a decisive result; these are discussed below.Size of Poll and I-Iajority2,2      The Government have agreed to be bound by the verdict of theBritish people, as expressed in the referendum result.   They have considered whether that result should be subject to any special conditionsin terms of the size of the poll or the extent of the majority.2.3      It may be argued that a verdict of such importance should not depend on a simple majority - theoretically a single vote in over20 million.   A poll of a minimum size might be specified; or,alternatively, it might be laid down that the number of votes cast orthe number composing the majority should exceed a specified proportionof the total electorate.   Some countries have applied conditions ofthis kind to their referenda, though they are usually intended to makeit impossible for constitutional changes to be introduced too easily orby a minority of the electorate.2.4      The Government are concerned that the size of the poll should be adequate, and they are confident that it will be so.   They also consider
COMHD2H&apos;TlALi- 5 -it to be of great importance that the verdict of the poll should be clear and conclusive.   In the circumstances they believe that it willbe best to follow the normal electoral practice and accept that the referendum result should rest on a simple majority - without qualificationsor conditions of any kind.The Question on the Ballot Paper2.5      It has been suggested that more than one question should beposed on the ballot paper, and that the questions should include oneasking if the voters would prefer to leave the issue to Parliament.But the Prime Minister has made it clear on several occasions that the referendum will ask for a simple &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to a single straight-forward question about staying in or leaving the Community in the lightof the renegotiated terms of membership and the Government believe thatthe advantage lies with simplicity.     The question will be embodied inthe Referendum Bill itself and will therefore be approved by Parliament.2.6      Some argue that the precise wording of the question can have a significant effect upon the result.   Although there is no reliableevidence to support this view, the Government will seek to ensure thatthe words on the ballot paper are as free from bias as possible.[2.7 The Government are not yet committed to any form of words butpropose for discussion that the ballot paper should read as follows:
On 1 January 1973 the United Kingdom, Denmark andIreland joined Belgium,. France, Germany, Italy, .Luxembourg and the Netherlands as members of the european community. .The Government have announced the results; ofthe renegotiation of the United Kingdom&apos;s terms of membership.DO YOU THINK THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM SHOULD STAY IN THEEUROPEAN COMMUNITY?YES]\ - &apos; froProvision will, be made for. bilingual ballot papers to be used atpolling stations in Wales.]OR[2.7 The Government are not yet committed to any form of wording butpropose for discussion that the ballot paper should read as follows:The Government have announced the results of the renegotiation of the United Kingdom&apos;s terms of membership of the European Community.DO YOU THINK THAT THE UNITED KINGDOM SHOULD STAY INTHE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY?YESNOL-_..............._-__JProvision will bo made for bilingual ballot papers to be usod at pollistations in Wales.]

CONFIDENTIAL.-8- .. -        3*   ; REFERENDUM ARRMGEMENTS&apos;3*1      This chapter considers the practical arrangements for holdingthe referendum;   casting votes;   counting them;   and announcing theresult........    ... .    _______ -  - . b&apos;\V.\ &apos;;- &apos;Electorate3.2      The electorate will consist of-those on the current parliamentary election register which came into force earlier this month, together withpeers (who are registered for local government elections hut cannotvote in Parliamentary elections.)Responsibility for local conduct of the Poll3.3      There are some differences in the electoral arrangements for various purposes in different parts of the United Kingdom.   For the referendum the Government have concluded that the most satisfactoryadministrative arrangement will be to place the responsibility forpolling arrangements (other than counting the votes) in England and Waleson the returning officers for district council and London borough elections,in Scotland on the returning officers for regional and islands area authority elections and in Northern Ireland on the Chief Electoral Officer.Absent. Voting.3.4      The Government propose to include in&apos;the&quot; Bill a provision whichwould .permit the postal and proxy- voting facilities&quot;which are availablefor general elections to be valid.for tho- referendum poll.   Special stepsWill be.taken to advertise these*fabilities; and&apos;it is hoped that thoseeligible for absent votes who.are not already registered for them will apply now in. order to reduce the burden- ,on those who will be. organising the physical arrangements for the poll.   The Governments view is that,
CONFIDENTIAL-9-as in Parliamentary elections, those on holiday should not be ableto vote by post or by proxy.Poll Cards3.5      Poll cards are not an indispensable part of the electoralprocedure but they.serve a useful purpose.   They remind the electorof his right to vote and they tell him his voting number and wherehis polling station is.   It is hoped that poll cards can be produced in time for the referendum poll but this turns on the availability ofmaterials and technical factors which are being explored.Polling3.6      Polling will be in the normal wayj   from 7 a.m. to 10 p.n. onthe appointed day voters will go to the local polling stations,.whiohwill be those normally used for general elections.   They will receive a ballot paper from the presiding officer;   enter a booth j   mark thepaper in one of two clearly marked placesj   and put it, folded, intothe ballot box. , - &quot;;  :Independent ,scrutiny3*7      The.absence of.any candidates Or their election or pollingagents will leave the referendum without an important element of theordinary electoral machinery unless&apos; some other provision is made.Candidates and their agents are specifically afforded access to thevarious stages in the procedure at which ballot papers are handled?the despatch and.opening.of-postal vdtes, the casting of votes inpolling stations,and) thO&apos;countv&quot;-&apos;    The&apos; Government are considering towhat extent.the presence of independent&apos;observers would be appropriate and useful at the equivalent- stages in the referendum poll.
CONFIDENTIAL-10-Counting the votes and announcing the result3.8   ----- The votes&apos; cast at local polling&apos;stations and sealed intoballot-boxes there can be counted at various levels.   These dividebroadly into, a choice between a central count and a variety of methods of^counting locally.3.9      It would be practicable to arrange for the votes to be counted,as they are in.local and Parliamentary elections, by local governmentdistrict and London borough or by Parliamentary constituency.   Thisarrangement would have advantage of speed in execution;   of providingconveniently for the possibility of re-counts and checks in the caseof alleged fraud or accident;   of familiarity to those engaged in thecount;   and of. economy in organisation.   It would also be&apos; possible toarrange -for the count to be organised by counties..-   The results wouldbecome known at whatever level they were&quot;counted and whatever thearrangements made for announcing or declaring them.3...10 -  To arrange for all votes cast in the United Kingdom to be counted centrally would involve the creation of new machinery and would clearly bo a major administrative task; . involving as it would thetransport of ballot boxes from polling stations to the counting centre.The count itself is likely to require at least five working days, includingpolling day.i3.11    In considering these alternatives the Government have attachedparticular weight to the character of the referendum as a nationalpoll on a national issue, organised to secure the verdict of the wholeBritish people.   The constituency is the whole of the United Kingdom.In this respect the referendum will be fundamentally different froma General Election where individual members of Parliament are elected by individual constituencies.   The Government have taken full account
-11-of the views of those who believe that the voting pattern of thodifferent parts of the United Kingdom should be made knowij   but they believe that the most appropriate arrangement in the specialcircumstances of the referendum will be to count all the votes castcentrally and to make a singie &quot;declaration of the United&apos; Kingdohresult.   To announce the result in tnis way will     -&quot; secure the widest acceptance of the re suit&apos;&quot;by the&apos;British people&apos;.  &quot;&apos;   &apos;&quot;3.12    Detailed arrangements for a central count are now: being&apos;planned.   The possibility is being considered of using any mechanicalprocesses, including computers&apos;, which may bo of assistance,&apos;though amanual count is judged likely to prove the most reliable arrangement.One centre in London may be used for the&apos; count in the interests of security and&apos;economy of organisation.3.13   A&apos; national returning officer will be appointed in due course.He will be&apos; responsible for the arrangements for counting the votes andcertifying the&apos; result of the referendum which will be:&quot;reported toParliament by the Prime Minister.

-19-INPORIIATION ACTIVITIES OP OUTSIDE BODIES4.8      The Government have considered whether any special arrangements are needed either to limit or to assist activities by outside bodies and individuals designed to inform the public of their views on the issues involved in the referendum,.   Little assistance can be derivedfrom the precedent of Parliamentary elections in which the main control is on any expenditure designed to secure the election of a particularcandidate.   Expenditure by, for example, the national party organisations,which cannot be related to the campaign of any particular candidate, isuncontrolled.   The Government approach this difficult area with no desireto limit traditional freedom of speech but rather with a desire to seethat both sides of the case are known to the public and that publicinterest in the issues is stimulated.Television and RadioThe Government are confident that the IBA and BBC will exercise editorialdiscretion designed to ensure that there is a fair balance between the opposing views in news and feature programmes.   The broadcasting authorities may also decide to run a series of short &quot;referendum broadcasts&quot;analogous to party political broadcasts.   In this way an equal number of short periods of television time would-be&quot;made available to the maincampaigning organisations in the two or three weeks before polling day.The Government would welcome such an initiative.4.10     The television programme companies of the IBA are forbidden by statute from accepting political advertising.   This prohibition appliesalso to independent local radio.
- 20 -Other Activities4.11     There is concern that the organisation favouring one course willhave greater resources than those favouring another.   It is already-clear that any such imbalance, if it exists, is not preventing both sidesfrom obtaining wide coverage of their, views.   The Government are convincedthat any attempt to limit total expenditure by&apos; the two sides would be impracticable - not least because it could apply only after legislation .had received Royal Assent.[4-12    The Government consider, however, that it would be appropriate forthe public to know how much money has been spent on the campaign by majororganisations and interests.   Although this can be known only after the -event, it could exercise a restraining influence   and involves information that is legitimately of public interest.   It is therefore proposed that the.legislation should provide for such expenditure to be disclosed.]4-13     Careful consideration has been given to the possibility ofbanning or limiting certain activities in order to ensure fair play.The Government consider that restrictions and requirements which apply tothe conduct of a general election campaign should as far as practicableapply to the referendum; these will include, for example, a ban on theemployment of paid canvassers and a requirement that all campaignliterature, posters etc should bear the name and address of the sponsoring .organisations. -4.14    The Government have received representations-that any adverse effect there might be&quot; on the balance of the campaign if one side had moreresources than the other could be substantially reduced by a ban on the
- 21publication by newspapers of paid campaign advertisements, except thosenecessary to publicise campaign meetings.   [The Government agree andthe proposed legislation will contain powers to allow such a boh to beput into effect for the duration of the campaign only.] or [The government believe that such a ban would be an unacceptable restriction on a normalfreedom and that it might have an adverse effect on the impact of the campaign and the number of people who decide to vote-]4-.15    Employers may seek to influence the views of their employees andtrade unions the views of their members by warning them in&apos;their placeof work of the dangers to thoir jobs of one outcome or another of the referendum.   The Government do not believe that the control of such activities by employers or trade unions is an appropriate subject for legislation but hope that none of those concerned will engage incampaigning activities that might be damaging to industrial relations.Omit ifversionsA or b of paras4-2-4.7adopted[Assistance from Public Funds4.I6    The Government have considered whether a /fair and effectivereferendum requires the subsidy from public funds of the campaigningorganisations.   They believe that the provision of-funds Would be &apos;inappropriate.   As already explained in paragraphs .4.2-4-7 above, theGovernment are, however, proposing to pay for the production anddistribution of a document c ontaining a clear statement of both sides of the case.   The distribution of this document to all&apos; households will ensure that the public have access to a clear and concise statement by the two sides.]
5*2      The legislation will need to mako specific provision for various matters which will apply uniquely to the referendum and to adapt the existing electoral machinery as necessary.   To avoidburdening tho Bill with a great deal of technical matter theGovernment propose that the Bill itself should be confined to thenew provisions relating to the referendum together with a power to adapt the electoral machinery by Order.   The Order will be laidimmediately after the Bill has received Royal Assent.5.3      The substance&apos; of the Order will be published as a White Paperat the time the Bill is introduced or very soon afterwards.   This willenable the Bill to be debated against the background of specific proposals relating to the machinery;   it will also enable the staffconcerned with the machinery to make their preparations.   The contents of the Order will be technical and seem likely to be uncontrovorsial.The Government will however take account of any views on matters of detail expressed during the debates on the Bill.5.4      The division of material between the Bill and the Order willnot be inflexible.   The Government will consider any proposals for promoting particular subjects from the Order to the Bill provided thiswill not result in delaying progress.   Subject to this the Bill itself is likely to contain the basic provision for holding the referendumand to determine the date;   to specify the wording of the quostionj5.   LEGISLATION ,    ,\5.1      In his statement on 23 January the Prime Minister announcedthat the Government proposedto introduce legislation at Easter- .time to provide for the holding of the referendum.
5*3      Because of its importance., the comittee stage of the Bill willbe taken on the ELoor of the House of Commons..  The Government are confident that, while different views will no doubt be strongly expressed,the great majority of members of both Houses of Parliament will recognise the importance of enacting the Bill speedily in   order to permit the referendum to be held well before the summer holidays. :to deal with the appointment of some person to have overall responsibilityfor counting the votes and announcing the. result;   to make appropriatefinancial provision; and &quot;to include the power, to. adapt the, existing .machinery.by order.

ANNEX ASTATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER ON 23.1.75.- Mr. Speaker, 1 will, witli per-Rission, make a statement about thencans by which the British people will-iceide the issue of our membership of health  European Community. .. it is the declared policy of the Gov-niiiicut that, once the outcome of our negotiation of the terms of membership; known, the British people should havehe right to decide, through the ballotmx, by means either of a General Elec- .ion or of a referendum, whether Britainhould continue in membership of the &apos;iuropcan   &apos; Community    or    should &apos;withdraw.The Goveniment have decided that this.v.&apos;.&apos;d   he-   done   by   means   of   a .ferendum. - -  - -      &apos;Prolonged uncertainty and delay onthe decision of the British people are inthe interests neither of Britain nor ofother members of the Community. After15 years of discussion and negotiation,it is an issue which all of us in this house and in the country want to seesettled ; and uncertainty about the futureof British membership is inhibiting the-work of the Community. The Govcrh-ment are committed to putting the issue to the people before 10th October thisyear. Provided that the outcome or&quot;renegotiation is known in time, we intend to hold the referendum before the summerholidays, which means in practice not later than the end of June. We shall,therefore, propose to the House arrange-rhents which would make it possibleto hold the referendum on that time-table, tight though it will be.When the outcome of renegotiation isknown, the Government will decide upon their own recommendation to the coun-try, whether for continued membership of the Community on the basis of therenegotiated terms, or for withdrawal, andwill announce their decision to the house in due course. That announcement willprovide an opportunity for the house to debate the question of substance. that does not, of course, preclude debates atany earlier time, subject to the con-venienee of the House.The circumstances of this referendumare unique, and the issue to be decidedis one on which strong views have long been held which cross party lines. TheCabinet has, therefore, decided that, ifwhen the time comes there are membersof the Government, including membersof the Cabinet, who do not feel ableto accept and support the Governmentsrecommendation: whatever it may be,they will, once the recommendation hasbeen announced, be free to support andspeak in favour of a different conclusion in the referendum campaign.such matters as, for example, the iiuV&apos;malion policy of the Government duriii,&apos;the referendum campaign, broaden: ti:-arrangements during the campaign. ii&apos;question of expenditure by camr&quot;h&apos;nin:groups, the form in which the miesliniiis to be put to the British people, ns.ularrangements for conducting the poll. &apos;iicounting of the votes and the annouiieo-mcnt of the result.The Government will provide lime fora debate on the White Paper on rclercn-dum procedure in this House before the easter recess. That debate will, o!course, be separate from, and will pre-cede, the parliamentary debate which willbe necessary on the outcome of the nego-tiations. The debate on the refcr:inliii!iWhite Paper will enable the Gowinm-iiito take full account of the views r\-pressed by right hon. and hon. Mci! ;rsof this House, and by public opiniongenerally, in drafting the necessary le;*is-lation for the referendum.The Government propose to hitro&apos;J&apos;&apos;!&apos;cthe legislation around Easter-time. VyVshall, of course, propose that all storesshould be taken on the Floor uf :!-eHouse. If we are to be able to (ioio &quot;liereferendum before the summer ht&apos;l&quot;l;:y.the Bill will need to complete its p:iv,;;;-ethrough both Houses and to tec-iveRuval Assent by the end of May.As to the arrangements for the reference--dum, I told the House on Tuesday thatthe rules for the test of public opinion; must be made by this House. The Gov-: eminent propose within a very few weeks- to publish a White Paper on the rules! and arrangements for conducting the; referendum.

In certain circumstances a proposed alteration can be submitted to a referendumif passed on two separate occasions by only one House..Referenda can also be held to obtain the views of the electorate on politically sensitive issues.The Chief Electoral Officer distributes a pamphlet to every voter, showing the proposed constitutionalalterations together with the arguments for and against.   Each argument is limited to two thousandwords and is authorised by a majority of itssupporters in both Houses,    Campaign expenses,, including&apos;Ithe cost of publishing referendum material, incurred by 1persons, political parties or other organised bodiesmust be shown on returns submitted after the referendum.!Returns are also submitted by newspaper-proprietors,showing names and addresses of those inserting refer.endr.jmaterial and amounts paid or outstanding.. All returns are open to public inspection. There are no ceilings .on expenditure but Parliament &quot;is at present considering a proposal to limit the referendum expenses of-political!parties.

Constitutional amendments are subject toReferendum under Article 88,   Seven referenda havebeen held since 1953.For the ESC Referendum, held under Article 20 on  October 1972, the Government and the Folketingundertook an intensive educational campaign.

The Folketingissued a 16 page broadsheet which was distributed to every elector containing articles for and againstDanish   membership and official statements by the nine major political parties.    Government funds, managed by the Ministry of Education according to a strictlydefined formula, were made available to parties and organisations involved in the information campaign:the total amount of public money spent beingapproximately  1,1+00,000 for a population of 5 millions.3confident!,&apos;&apos; /in 1972

.. FRANCEI Under Article 3 of the Constitution, nationalI sovereignty belongs to the people who exercise itI through their elected representatives or by referendumI Under Article 11, the President, on the proposal ofthe 3-overnment when Parliament is in session, or ofthe two Assemblies jointly, may submit to referendumany Government bill dealing with specified subjects.These include ratification of a Treaty which, although not in conflict with the Constitution, would affect   -the workings of public institutions.   A special provision exists under Article 89 on amendments to theConstitution, where the initiative belongs jointly tothe President on the proposal of the Prime Ministerand to Members of Parliament; the proposal must be ...voted by both Houses in identical terms after whichthe President may choose to submit it to a referendumwhich is binding.   On two occasions, however,Constitutional amendments have been taken underArticle 11 rather than Article 89.Normal voting procedures apply to referenda, and all political parties enjoy the same propaganda facilitiesI(television, radio, etc) as in elections.   Before the1972 referendum on enlargement of the European
Communities each voter was sent, together with hisballot papers, an explanatory text containing adeclaration by the President, the question to beset in the referendum, the decree submitting thePill authorising the ratification of,the Treaty of accession to a referendum, the text of the -bill itself, the text of the Treaty of Accession, and aresume of its annexes (complete texts of which wereavailable in town halls).Referendum questions are always put to the voters inthe following form: &quot;Do you approve of the Billsubmitted to the French people by the President ofthe Republic and concerning *...?&quot;   The result is decided by a simple majority of votes cast, and facilities for postal and proxy voting are available.Votes are counted by polling stations and areannounced for each de*partement and for the nation as a whole; from these the figures for eachparliamentary constituency may be deduced.   Publishedresults include the number of eligible voters, thenumber of votes cast, of abstentions, blank, spoiledand valid votes as well as yes and no votes.

These must be requested within threemonths of the publication of the laws or amendmentsby one-fifth of the members of either Chamber or notless than five hundred thousand electors or fiveregional councils.   Under Article 75, the two lastmay also call a referendum for the partial or totalabrogation of existing legislation, except fiscal and    j:budget laws, pardons and amnesties and laws authorising the ratification of international treaties.   a referendum cannot be held on a constitutional law which has been approved during a second reading byJtwo-thirds of the members of each Chamber.    Referendaon the abrogation of legislation may not be calledoutside the parliamentary session or in the first year of Parliament&apos;s life.The publicity campaign begins thirty days beforepolling day.    The promoters of the referendum(recognized as one group only) and Parliamentaryparties are entitled to the same facilities as partiesparticipating in an electoral campaign.   The Statebears the cost and no ceilings are imposed on expenditure.   The Italian Parliament voted approximately 20 million for the 1971+ Divorce referendum.The question put is formulated differently accordingto whether the referendum is on a constitutionalquestion or the abrogation of legislation, but both       j7/require

There is nopostal vote in Italy.Votes are counted by constituencies, and the result isdeclared by the Central Office for the Referendum, which states whether the law concerned has received a greater number of valid affirmative or negative votes.

SWEDENArticle 7:3 of the 1975 Constitution states:  &quot;provisions for an advisory referendum throughout the country shallbe laid down in law.&quot;    There is no standing legislation,,Three earlier referenda, on prohibition (1922),right-hand driving (1955) and social security (1957)were also advisory and their conduct was governed by special legislation in each case.In 1955 and 1957 the State financed its own. neutralinformation campaign and no ceilings were set for totalexpenditure.    In 1955 the question of right-hand drivingwas not a politically significant issue, and the prosand cons were put by two- ad hoc committees established with government approval.    The political parties wereactive in the ad hoc committees established in 1957,however, as well as on their own behalf,.    One million(approx  68,750)-kronerwere made available to each side in -1955 and two million (approx  137,900) in 1957.In 1955 the electorate was asked to vote Yes or No tothe proposed introduction of right-hand driving, and in1957 they were given the choice of three proposals for pension schemes.   On this occasion a blank vote wasconsidered as a vote against all three, and the resultNo majority requirements have been stipulated forreferenda because of their advisory status, and the 1955decision was reversed in 1967 without further recourse to referendum.    The voting procedure and count have beenwas inconclusive.15

sv/nzsiiiiAHpONFIDtN i JALAll constitutional changes proposed by the government or legislature must be approved by a nationalreferendum.    Constitutional changes may also be proposed for submission to referendum by not less&quot;than fifty thousand voters, although such referenda canbe delayed.    Ordinary legislation at national levelmay also be submitted to referendum at the request ofnot less than thirty thousand voters or of thelegislators of eight Cantons, unless a decree isdeclared by   the Federal legislator to be &apos;urgent&apos;and, therefore, temporarily exempt.    In eight of theCantons all laws must be submitted to referendum andin seven others a referendum must be held if a specifiednumber of citizens demand it.    In a further three Cantonscertain laws must be submitted to referendumi and othex&apos;Smust be submitted if a specified proportion of theIcitizens demand it, blocal authorities provide information on referendumissues at the cantonal level, but in national referendathe electorate is dependent upon material put out bythe various campaigning groups.    These receive no support from the Public 3xcheqx\er.The referendum usually consists of a question to whichthe voter is asked to reply Yes or No.    If theFederal Government disagrees with the intent of aproposal, a counter proposal may be submitted to &apos;referendum at the same time.   Again a simple Yes or no answer is required.3.7; /Constitutional I
CONFIDENTIAL &quot;Constitutional changes must be-.approver! by a majorityof all vote        t and a majority of Cantons.   A simple majority of votes cast is sufficient for the rejection of legislation at National and Cantonallevel.    Votes are counted and published at Communelevel.18CONHDENTiAv
CQNFiOcNTiALUNITED STATES 0? AMERICA-.The Federal Constitution makes no provision forreferenda, but thirty-nine States provide for referendaon x^proposals passed by the State legislatures or at local government levels, and twenty-one States forlegislative initiatives by a percentage of voterswhich varies from State to State.   Both devices may apply to constitutional amendment as well as to ordinary legislation, but at no level of government can the scope of a referendum exceed the competence ofthe legislative body concerned.Those responsible for proposing an initiative, oftenorganised pressure groups, are also responsible fortheir own campaign costs.    There- are no limits on expenditure.    The cost of balloting, however, isgenerally borne by the state or municipality, and insome States, eg in Oregon and California, the Stateprovides official literature on referenda issues.Proposals submitted to the electorate may be complex,as in the 23 point environmental plan put to the vote in the 1972 referendum on pollution in California, butthe answer required is usually Yes or No.    Referendaare generally held at the same time as the biennialcongressional and local elections and normal facilitiesfor absentee (postal) voting are provided.Majorities required vary from State to State and can also vary according to the issue (amendments to Stateconstitutions sometimes require more than a simple/majority),
CONHD&amp;NTlAtmajority).   Referenda votes are counted at precinctlevel., but the official resLtlts are normally reported by country and,  in a few instances, by city.    the overall figures for spoilt votes are also published bysome States.20
