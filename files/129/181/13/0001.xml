THE SUGAR situation memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food. In the Annex I consider in detail the present state of our sugarnegotiations; the supply situation; and the options open to us.   There are so many factors to take into account in this complex situation that the Annexis unavoidably lengthy.   I have, therefore, sought to summarise the main points as follows.THE TALKS2.        Talks with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Sugarproducers have been postponed.   We have offered to guarantee a price of 250 a ton cif for sugar arriving in 1975.    They have said they would be willing to accept  283 cif, but only if we extended the period of the guaranteefrom a year to at least 18 months,SUPPLY situation*        We have enough sugar committed to us to last until some t4meApril.    Until October, when sugar will be available from the new beet crop,we need to get from the Community, the ACP countries or the world marketa total of about 1. 56 tons.   Allowing for a maximum of 600, 000 tons fromother member States, this can be covered at reasonable prices only if wecan get about 600, 000 tons from the ACP countries or a further extensionof Community subsidies on imports at world prices.    Failing these, weshould have to buy on the world market at perhaps  400 a ton.    The situationis fully set out in paragraphs 5-9 of the Annex.THE OPTIONS4.        We have three choices:a.        to stand firm on our present offer and hope that the ACPcountries will split;1C(75) 13 COPY NO       8124 January 1975CABINET
b. to improve our offer;c. to concede the ACP Group&apos;s full demands,5.        Taking these in reverse order,  I do not think we should concede the ACP Group!s demands.    The cost would be up to  110 million, on top of the very substantial cost of our present offer.    I do not believe that thisis necessary to get agreement with at any rate the non-Caribbean suppliers.Nor do I think we should improve our offer at this stage.    This would playinto the hands of the hard-liners and encourage the whole Group to hold oatfor their full demands.6.        I therefore believe we should stand firm on our present offer and allow time for the moderates who really want an agreement - Mauritius,Fiji, Swaziland and possibly Guyana - to put pressure on the hard-liners^led by Mr Patterson of Jamaica, to moderate the ACP demands,,    Ido not want to see an open split in the ACP group any more than Judith Hart does.This would be bad for the Protocol 22 negotiations generally, for our sugarsupplies and for our relations with the developing world.    I want instead to encourage the moderates to get the whole Group!s attitude changed.On timing, I recommend that we wait for signs that the non-Caribbeancountries are putting real pressure on Patterson and want a resumptionof talks.    These signs should appear at the next round of Protocol talks on 30-31 January.    We should make no unilateral move until they areforthcoming: to do so would be regarded as committing us to make a newoffer.7^        I fully realise the dangers of a protracted delay in signing theConvention under Protocol 22,    If my recommendation is followed the31 January date will almost certainly slip to, say, mid-February.    I think we have to accept this possibility.    And I should point out that in my viewsimply to improve our offer now would strengthen the ACP demand for the lot, which could make the delay even longer.    The implications for the protocol 22 negotiations are discussed more fully in paragraphs 12-15 ofthe Annex.8.        When talks eventually resume I believe we shall have to makeface-saving concessions to get an agreement without an open split.    i suggest three for my colleagues&apos; consideration:-i. A change in the basis of the guarantee from cif to fob,thus safeguarding suppliers from increases in freight rates.ii. In the last resort, some small improvement in the guaranteed return by making this  240 fob (equivalent, at currentfreight rates, to  255 cif).2
iii. An assurance that, if world prices remain high, we will consider giving a further guarantee, at a level to be considered at the time, for the period after 1975.conclusion.        I invite my colleagues to endorse the tactics I suggest inparagraph 6 and to consider the possible face-saving concessions I suggestin paragraph 8.TFPMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food24 January 19753
AN2MTH5 SUGAR SITUATIONIntroduction1.   In this Annex I consider in detail the negotiating optionsbefore us, in the light of the sugar supply situation.Ti. ^ State of Negotiations2.   My last discussions with the Group as a whole were on12; January in Brussels.   The two positions at the close were asfollows:-United Kingdom;   Offered to guarantee  250 ci.f. forsugar arriving in the UK during the calendar year 1975.Offered to insure suppliers against increase of freight rates of more than 10 per cent in 1975.ACP Sugar Groupx   Firmly rejected  250 c.i.f.   Preparedto accept  283 c.i.f., provided this related to period up to end-June 1976.   Asked us to consider givingfive-year guarantee.   Showed little interest in our offer on freight.   Would continue negotiations withCommunity and resume talks with us when we thoughttime propitious, preferably in a sugar-preducing country.3.   I had also offered to make a retrospective payment for 1974sugar from Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados, as they had requested,provided that they agreed to  250 c.i.f. for 1975 and that theWest Indies as a group undertook to supply 1+50,000 tons.   Theyrejected these conditions and I therefore withdrew my offer (whichwould be equivalent to about  30 a ton on 1975 sugar from thesecountries).4.   On 17 January Mr. Boolell, the Mauritius Minister ofAgriculture, met me secretly in London, at his request.   . 3 saidMauritius was determined to secure a long-term agreement withthe Community.   He had however been under instructions from his prime Minister to preserve the ACP Group&apos;s unity.   He had nowcabled for fresh instructions, but could not begin to work on1.
Patterson (Jamaica&apos;s Minister of Trade, who leads the Group) untilthe general Protocol 22 talks with the Community were resumedon 29 January.   He implied that Mauritius would settle for aguarantee of  250 f*o.b. (equivalent to about  265 c.i.f.) forthe calendar year 1975* provided that she was assured that the1 &apos;emium over the price guaranteed by the Community would hereviewed annually so long ae world prices remained high.   Hethought Fiji and Guyana were also anxious for an agreement, hutit would he extremely difficult for any of them to split openly?they would have to persuade Patterson and the other hard-linersto moderate their position, and could do this only if they knew that some improvement in our offer was available.   I said thatI could hold out no hope of our changing our position on the price,though we had shown that we were prepared to be flexible on the freight question.The Supply Situation5*   Our sugar requirements from 1 January until the end ofSeptember (when the next European beet crop will begin to beavailable) are probably about 2.07 million tons of refined sugar.This estimate includes contracted re-exports of 150,000 tons of sugar &quot;borrowed&quot; from the world market in 1974*   The estimate forconsumption - 1.92m tons - is subject to a good deal of uncertainty,The price tc the housewife has increased from lip to 28-30p per2 lb. bag in recent months, and demand in the shops has certainlyfallen - though this may in part reflect the consumption of household stocks bought earlier.   Pood manufacturers have cut bad:their usage of sugar to the legal minimum in products such assoft drinks, and may start to switch out of sugar-intensiveproducts as sales resistance to high prices builds up.   It isvery difficult, however, to predict the effect of a price increaseof such unprecedented size.   Home allowance has been made forreduced consumption, but If anything the consumption figure maybe over-stated.2.
6.   During January-September, home-produced beet sugar will account,at most, for 370,000 tons.   In addition 137*000 tons of sugarshipped in 1974 under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement is available.    These supplies leave a net deficit of 1.56m tons.7.   There are three possible sources of this sugari   the AGPcountries, under a long-term agreementf   beet sugar from other member countries;   and sugar from the world market, with or without Community subsidy(i) The ACP countries.   Given a long-term agreement, wecan expect to get 260,000 tons from AGP countries other than the West Indies during these months(unfortunately most Southern Hemisphere sugar wouldnot arrive until after   September).   If the west indies agree to send 450,000 tons a year (theprobable maximum), about 390,000 tons of this couldbe expected to arrive in January-September.   Bo even with an agreement and fully/est Indies participationover 900,000 tons has to come from other sources.Without it the figure is 1.56m tons,(ii) Other member countries.   According to theCommission, some 500,000 tons of sugar from the1974 crops in other members&apos; countries has alreadybeen sold to UK buyers, and 320,000 tons of thisremains to be imported in January-September.   TheCommission assume that nearly all the other sugaravailable from the surplus areas will also come here(because our market price is the highest in theCommunity), resulting in supplies of 61*0,000 tons ;nall from this source in the 9-month period, most oit refined.   If this happened, if the AGP countriesreached agreement with us, and if the West Indiesactually sent 450,000 tons this year, our requirements,3.
taking account of what has already been importedwith Community subsidy, would be within about100,000 tons of being met.   But most traders thinkthat the Commission^ estimate of potential supplies from the Community is inflated,(iii) World market.   The refiners have bought about250,000 tons of world market sugar for the UKmarket, in expectation of Community subsidy.   Theyhave so far tendered successfiilly for subsidy on150,000 tons, out of the first tranche of200,000 tons for which Community arrangements weremade in October.   The Council of Ministers has now decided to subsidise a further 300,000 tonnes, and specific arrangements have been made for 200,000tonnes of this.   Some of this, however, will haveto go to Italy, which also faces a serious shortage.The Commission has power to allocate subsidisedsugar to deficit areas if necessary, and will do soto Italy if she fails to get any sugar bycompetitive tender.     So long as we have not reached agreement with the ACP countries, we shall have asstrong a claim as Italy for any allocated sugar;but we clearly cannot rely on getting as large ashare of this second tranche as we did of the first.If we were to get only about half this second tranche,our subsidised imports under the scheme so far wouldtotal about 300,000 tons.   If there were no agreementwith AC? countries, hr -/ever, we should need, even ifthe full 640,000 tons   f Community beet sugar camehere, total subsidised imports of around 920,000tens - i.e, over 600,000 tons more than we may get from the two tranches so far agreed by the Council.
8,   In this complex situation there are differing timetables forthe various supply difficulties that could arise.   The british sugar Corporation will go on selling their limited quantity ata steady pace in the east and north-east of the country rightthrough until October.   Some of the food manufacturers may havealready contracted for their full requirements (as Communitybeet sugar) until the same date, and many may have enough to last till the summer.   The port refiners have bought enough sugarto go on refining until the end of March (50,000 tons of this has still to receive subsidy), and also some 50,000 tons for arrivalafter March.   The fairest summary of the situation is that thepresent flow of sugar on to the market can be maintained until some time in April.   Thereafter, unless there were agreement withthe ACP countries or a massive increase in the quantity of sugaron which the Community decided to pay subsidy, we should be largelyand increasingly dependent on unsubsidised and as yet unboughtworld market sugar (current price around  1+00, per ton).Availability of sugar from other sources9.   In our last discussion my colleagues enquired about potentialsources of sugar outside the Community and ACP Group.   For theperiod up to September, small parcels of world market sugar couldbe picked up from a variety of alternative sources, at tho goingworld pricej   but in the absence of an ACP agreement the ACPthemselves would probably be the main source of uncommitted *world market sugar.   As regards the longer term, the world*s majorexporters are Cuba, Australia and Brazil.   Most other non-ACPcountries export only small quantities.   It seems unlikely thatin the absence of agreement with the ACP countries we could make substantial alternative long-term arrangements on significantlybetter terms with other suppliers, leaving aside the difficultysuch a proposal would cause vis-a-vis the Community.   In particular,Australia has made it plain that she would supply only on thebasis of a long-term contract, at a price above the likely levelof e.c. prices in 1975. but linked to future movements in thoseprices.5.
mImplications for Consumers10.   Failure to agree with the ACP need have no unfavourableimplications for consumers, so long as the Community adheres toits present decision of principle to subsidise imports from theworld market to make good the entire Community deficit.   In theseCircumstances, however, the quantities and cost would both bevery large, and the Community&apos;s resolution might well falter.Our refiners would then be driven to import unsubsidised world market sugar.   If the world price remains at present levels this could lead to an equalised price of as much as hop per 2 lb. pack(instead of a current 28-30p).   At this price level, consumption would almost certainly fall appreciably below the figuresuggested in paragraph 5, and the volume of refining - and theimport requirement - would therefore fall also.The Position of the Commission11.   The Council of Ministers undertook in October a commitment&quot;to adopt the measures necessary to ensure an adequate supplyof sugar throughout the Community for the 1974/75 marketing year,at common prices, the costs being financed by the Community underthe 1975 F20GA budgetary provisions&quot;.   Mr. Lardinois has 3takedthe whole weight of his personal prestige on making this commitment a reality, as the alternative to our suggested long-tealagreement with Australia.   Moreover, after having intially proposed!that we could not guarantee a price of more than 2165 a ton c.i.f.to the ACP countries, Mr. Lardinois was persuaded to give us a free hand and to trust to our judgment in limiting our offer towhat was defensible.   He is content with  25C a ton c.i.f. butregards this as the most that can be justified.   We can rely on him to use all his Influence to try to dissuade Germany&apos; and others ]from going back on the commitment to meet our deficit, if we fail to get adequate supplies from the ACP countries.   But we shouldseverely strain his good will if we went significantly above ourpresent offer.   He has more weight in the Commission than6.
M. Cheysson, whose main concern is simply to get the Protocol 22negotiations successfully concluded.Implications for the Protocol 22 negotiations with&apos;he A6P countries&quot;12,   The Jamaicans have persuaded the other ACP countries tosupport them publicly in refusing to conclude the new Conventionwith the Community (for which negotiations will resume in Brusselson 30/31 January) until there is a satisfactory agreement on sugar.The ACP group will do their best to preserve their public unity,since even those who are not directly interested in sugar know that unity increases their bargaining power on the matters inwhich they have a direct interest,13,   Nevertheless there are obvious tensions inside the group.Apart from the Mauritians and other Southern Hemisphere producerswho would be prepared to settle on something nearer our terms,many members of the group have no direct interest in sugar at all.There has already been criticism in the Nigerian press of theJamaican attitude (and indeed Mr, Patterson has even been criticised in his own press).Ik,   These forces wotk. in our favour.   But our wider interests would not be served by a public split in the group, leadingperhaps to the Caribbean countries withdrawing from the Protocol 22negotiations altogether.   The signature of the Protocol 22agreement would be delayed.   The unity of the French and BritishAfricans might be weakened.   There could be difficulty in negotiating arrangements which would preserve the Caribbeancountries1 existing trading privileges with the UK.   For allthese reasons we should, if possible, encourage the pressures onthe Caribbeans to operate within the ACP group without leading to a public split.15.   It will serve our interests best, both on sugar and in general,if the other remaining issues in the Protocol 22 negotiations canbe settled on 30/31 January.   Ideally, we should try to get thenew Convention initialled then.   This may be possible, though7.
the ACP countries&apos; unity is likely to he strong enough for themto say that they will not actually sign it until the 1975 sugarprice has been settled.   In such circumstances, the Africans maybe willing to put some pressure on the Caribbeans to come toa reasonable settlement on sugar.   If in the end the Caribbeanswere unwilling to compromise on sugar and as a result walked outof the Protocol 22 negotiations altogether, we should be betterplaced to put the blame on them and to salvage the Convention withthe African and Pacific countries.The Options16.   In this difficult situation the main options in our sugarnegotiations with the ACP countries are:-(i) to stand firm on our present offer and wait for theACP group to split;(ii) to make a revised offer higher than our present offerj(iii) to concede the ACP Group&apos;s full demands.17.   Taking these in reverse order, I am sure it would be wrong to concede the ACP Group&apos;s demands.   Their present bid could costan additional  45m in 1975, with up to an additional  65m inJanuary-June 1976, making  110m in all.   (Even our bid represents a substantially higher cost for developing Commonwealth sugar thanin the past.   In 1973, imports of 1.4m tons from the developing commonwealth cost  99m.   In 1974, the quantity went down to1.05m tons, but the cost rose to  149m.   Our proposal - if itelicited the full 1.4m tons - would represent an import bill of 369m.)   With signs already that Mauritius and possibly others are preparing to put pressure on the hard-liners for an agreement,it would be folly to concede to the latter now.18.   In my view the same argument holds good against makinga revised offer.   This would vindicate Patterson&apos;s hard line and make it much more difficult for Mauritius and others to win the day for moderation.8.
19.   I therefore believe the right course at present is to stand firm on our present offer.   Mauritius is clearly anxious for anagreement, and Fiji, Swaziland and Guyana are probably also likelyto favour moderation.   We must give them time to work on Pattersonand the other hardliners.   In the last resort they would. I believe,he prepared to have an open split if this were the only way toget an agreement.   But they will avoid this as long as they can)and it is in our own interest, in terms both of sugar supplies andof wider political and diplomatic considerations, that the west indies should be won over and supply sugar, rather than break openlyand switch entirely to the US and world markets.   It will almost certainly be necessary in the final stages to make some smallface-saving concessions to make this possible.   But first we shouldwait for signs that Mauritius and the others are prepared to putreal pressure on the West Indies.   If possible we should elicitthese at the time of the next round of Protocol 22 talks betweenthe ACP countries and the Commission (beginning on 30 January);and we should not propose a meeting - which, if we do it unilaterallywill be regarded as committing us to make a new offer - until oneor more supplying countries have provided the occasion for one byindicating that they want discussions to be resumed.20.   If these proposals are accepted, we need to consider also what form the face-saving concessions might take.   I put forward thefollowing for my colleagues * consideratlon:-(i) F.o.b. basis.   So. far we have made our offer on ac.i.f, basis in conformity with Community practice.   Butit is not essential that our guarantee should be on thesame basis as the Community1s.   If we guaranteed a priceon an f.o.b. basis our offer would be more attractive intwo respects.   First, it would safeguard the ACPcountries fully against increases in freight rates - andin a way which should not prejudice our position on9.
freight rates with other trading partners (theCommonwealth Sugar Agreement was itself on an f.o.b.basis)*   Secondly, if we related our guarantee toshipments leaving supplying countries before1 January 1976, instead of to shipments arriving inthe UK before that date, we should avoid unnecessarybunching of shipments to get the 1975 price and difficulties over shipping delaysj   and it might bethat small additional quantities would thereby qualify for the 1975 price.(ii) Price level.   Changing the basis of the guaranteed price would enable us, if we so decided, to make somemarginal improvement in the return to supplying countries without appearing to retreat from our firmstance of  250 c.i.f.   I would regard any suchimprovement as something to be conceded only in thevery last resort, and only if it were clear that thiswould secure agreement.   In those circumstances,however, I think we could agree to guarantee  22+0 f .o.b.This is equivalent to about  255 c.i.f. at presentfreight ratesj   but freight rates may fall in 1975.If they stayed at present levels, the cost of this concession would be up to  7m.(iii) Longer-term assurance.   It was quite clear from mylast discussion with the ACP countries that we shallbe pressed very hard to extend the period to which theguarantee relates.   I do not propose that we should doso, either to eighteen months or five years (bothperiods were mentioned).   But I think we shall be compelled to say something about the position in the longer term if world prices stay high.   We cannot afford to accept now a firm commitment to guaranteea high price in those circumstances:   we should want10.
to judge the case for this in the light ofthe supply position, and particularly theprice and availability of Community sugar.We cannot rely on being able to recoup anypart of the potential cost of such a guaranteeby re-exporting sugar to the world marketsthis would require negotiation with theCommunity, and probably with the supplying countries themselves.   On the other hand it seems clear that in 1976, the year whenthe situation is most likely to arise, weshould in fact be prepared to pay a higher price in order to ensure ACP supplies, if theworld price remained high.   I suggesttherefore that we should be prepared to give an assurance which, though not finallycommitting us, would give a reasonableindication of our likely intentions.   I suggestsomething on the following lines:   &quot;As regardsthe period after 1975. if world prices remainsubstantially above the price level guaranteed by the Community we shall be prepared to consider with you and with the Community the possibilityand extent of a further state guarantee of a supplementary price higher than that guaranteed by the Community.&quot;Conclusion21.   I invite my colleagues to endorse the tactics suggested inparagraph 19, and to consider the possible face-saving concessionsoutlined in paragraph 20.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood2k January 197511.
