CENSUS 1976 - parents  COUNTRIES OF BIRTHMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. I was unable to attend the Home Affairs Committee on 19 Decemberwhen the content of the Census in 1976 was considered.2. After discussion the Committee decided that the Census forms inEngland and Wales should include a question about the parents  countries of birth.    The main reasons for this decision, which was wanted particularly by the Department of Employment, the Home Office and the community relations Council, were as follows:-i. This question could be the main source of information aboutthe number of coloured people born in this country.    The present policy of channelling resources into those areas where the needswere greatest called for the most accurate information that could beobtained, and if a question about parents  countries of birth were not included in the Census it might be necessary to consider carrying out a separate survey to obtain the information.ii. The public attitude towards the coloured communities was now very different from what it had been in 1971, and resentment was much less likely to be aroused.    The extent of the feeling in 1971should not be exaggerated - in many cases failure to provide information about parents&apos; countries of birthseemed to have arisenmerely from misunderstanding about what was required.    The mainvoluntary bodies active in the field of race relations were now infavour of the inclusion of the question.   They were no longer anxious about its effect on immigrants as they had been in 1971 and they wereconscious of the advantages to be gained for Government policy tohelp immigrants of having accurate information of the main problemareas. 13.        Clearly, my colleagues had good reasons for supporting inclusion ofthis question, but both I and the Registrar General feel very strongly thatthe arguments against including the question in the Census are even morecogent.    This is why I ask my colleagues to review the decision taken atHome Affairs Committee.182C(75) 5 COPY NO13 January 1975CABINET
4a There are two main reasons for omitting the question on parents&apos;countries of birth from the 1976 Census:i. In 1971 this question caused more resentment than any other in what was the most controversial Census in living memory.    Itmight be thought that at least equal resentment would be caused bythe question about the per son1 s own country of birth, but theexperience of 1971 showed that this was not so.    The danger of including a controversial question is that it may have repercussionselsewhere in the Census and cause a disproportionate amount of damage to the accuracy and completeness of the returns.    It has beenargued that the atmosphere over colour was far more explosive in1971 than it is now.    But in my view and that of the Registrar general there is likely to remain wide spread potential resentment of theinclusion of the question and we can none of us forecast what the race relations situation will be in 15 months1 time.    Indeed it is possiblethen that the Irish would also resent the question.ii. The Registrar General proposes an alternative method forestimating the numbers and conditions of coloured people born in thiscountry.    His alternative method would, in essence, assign young people in the household to the ethnic group identified by the country of birth of the adults in the household.    Because the children of coloured immigrants are generally young, this method woulddistinguish very much the same people as the question on parents&apos;countries of birth except for a few small groups in whom I recognisethere is a special interest (for example, coloured adolescents born in this country who have left their parental home and colouredchildren living in institutions) - in total probably less than50, 000 people.    But in fact the suggested question on parents&apos;countries of birth would not in any case distinguish this group froma group - of comparable size - of white children of overseas parents.Moreover when that question was asked in 1971 three per cent of thepopulation did not answer it (this three per cent is more than theestimated total coloured population) and in only a minority of thesecases could parents&apos; countries of birth have been deduced from theform because the parents were themselves entered on it.5. We will be relying on the results of the 1976 Census to give the basicfacts for most of our social policies and I believe it would be wrong to risk the success of a Census covering 50 million people for the sake of questionswhich are resented by many and which would effectively serve to throw light,but not a clear light, on a group of no more than some 50, 000.6. I hope that my colleagues will agree on balance that the question onparents&apos; countries of birth should be omitted from the 1976 Census.BAGDepartment of Health and Social Security13 January 19752
