THE LUMPMemorandum by the Central Policy Review staff, The Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy considered on  December two proposals relating to the lump:a. The Minister for Planning and Local Governments proposalfor a 40 per cent penal levy on top of the existing 30 per centdeduction from members of the lump.    The Minister told theCommittee that the object of his proposal was to abolish the lump.b. The Paymaster-General&apos;s proposal for a 15 per centadditional charge on top of the existing 30 per cent deduction fromthe sub-contractor, which would represent the ernployer*s share of class I National Insurance contribution, employer^ liabilityinsurance, and holiday pay.    The object of this proposal was to abolish the abuses of the lump thus helping to reduce its size withoutdamaging the industry or penalising honest self-employedsub -contr actor s.2.        During the meeting the Lord President put forward a compromise which involved increasing the additional levy to 20 per cent, some of whichmight go into the National Insurance Fund.3.        On balance the Committee were in favour of the Ministers schemedesigned to abolish the lump, provided that it could be modified so as to incorporate a safeguard for the genuine self-employed sub-contractor whomet his tax and National Insurance obligations.4.        The Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) believes that ministers should recognise the difficulties of devising a scheme which will meet bothobjectives - to abolish the lump and to safeguard the genuine self-employedsub-contractor.10 1C(75) 2 COPY no 6 January 1975CABINET
5. No such scheme has yet been devised.    It has, for example, beensuggested that genuine self-employed glaziers, joiners, tilers, etc. couldbe encouraged to form themselves into one-man companies and thereafter be included in the proposed compulsory register,,    This would probablysafeguard the interests of the genuinely self-employed, at the expense tothem of some considerable administrative inconvenience.    But, by the sametoken, it would not markedly reduce the size of the lump let alone abolish it,for those on the lump could equally form themselves into one-mancompanies.6.        Other schemes which have been put forward bear more heavily onthe Tump but only at the expense of serious injustice to tens of thousands of genuine and honest craftsmen who have traditionally been self-employed on both large and small sites.7.        In this field it is only too easy to adopt a scheme which will fail in both objectives.    That is which hurts the genuine self-employed and yetfails to abolish the lump, for it results in increased tax evasion by encouraging collusion between contractor and sub-contractor.8.        In the view of the CPRS the Minister of Planning1 s scheme runs this danger and a compromise along the lines put forward by the Lord Presidentinvolving a 20 per cent levy on top of the existing 30 per cent deduction islikely to get nearer to both objectives.    It would clearly bear less heavily on the genuinely self-employed and, paradoxically, it may make a more effective contribution to the elimination of the lump.    This is because itwould be more closely tied to the Inland Revenue!s anti-avoidance activities and would not provoke the same widespread attempts at collusion andevasion as a levy at 40 per cent.Cabinet Office6 January 1975
