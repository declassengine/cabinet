S )/PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF HOLDING A REFERENDUMON EUROPEAN COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIP - REPORT BYOFFICIAL WORKING PARTYNote by the Lord President of the council. I shall shortly be circulating a paper on the issue of a referendumrelating to European Community membership.    In this I refer to a report prepared by an official working party on the practical implications of a referendum.    This report is attached for the information of my colleagues.2. I should emphasise that it was no more than a preliminary report,produced last November at the request of the Prime Minister.    It has beenovertaken in some detailed respects by further work carried out in preparation for the Cabinet discussion.    But I think that my colleagues may find it a useful analysis of the political questions to be considered, andof the principle facts and factors which will have to be taken into account.E privy Council Office17 January 1975C(75) 6 COPY NO       4 217 January 1975CABINET

(confidential)INTRODUCTION rIn October 1974, &quot;the Prime Minister agreed to the establishment of anofficial working party, composed of representatives of the Cabinet Office,the Foreign and commonwealth  .Tealth Office and the Home Office, with the following terms of reference:-&quot;To exa.mine, .and to report as soon as possible on, all the practical implications of holding a referendum relating to European Communitymembership, including the timetable to be followed if the Governmentare to discharge their pledge in their Election Manifesto.&quot;2.     A report is attached.   The Civil Service Department and the Officeof Population Censuses and Surveys have been informally consulted.3.     The report is necessarily interim in character.   The terms ofreference have presented a wide range of essentially political questions.The principal task of the working party has been to identify and define them,and to set out the principal facts and factors which need to be taken intoaccount.   Political guidance is now needed before work can be carried forward - covering a more detailed study of all aspects of the referendumcommitment, including an examination of the likely expenditure involved,and of the staff and administrative organisation which would be required.4*     A summary of the main questions is set out in Chapter 8.   attention is also drawn to Annex A, which provides notes on the experience ofreferenda in other countries, and notably of the Irish Republic, denmark and Norway in respect of referenda on entry into the European Community.
l3- Chapter 1: &apos; GOVSPJIKSIT COMMITMENT &apos;.1.1   The October Manifesto said:&quot;The labour Government pledges that uithin 12 months of thisElection we will give the British people the final say, whichwill be binding on the Government - through the ballot box - on whether we accept the terms and stay in or reject the terms andcome out.&quot;1.2   This political commitment presents three questions in itself;-a. When within the 12 months&apos; period is the referendum tobe held?b. What will constitute a valid expression of &quot;the final say&quot;by the British people? &quot; -c. What are the political and Parliamentary implications ofthe binding character of the commitment?TIKIITG OF RSFEHSIOTH1.3   On the assumption that renegotiation cannot be completed before,say, some timein March 1975, a referendum could not be held beforethe beginning of the summer at the earliest.   A referendum wouldrequire legislation;   and later Chapters deal with factors which maygovern the choice of timing.   The effective choice for holding a referendum is likely to lie between before the summer holiday period&apos;e&apos; not later than the second half of June 1975 - or after the holiday period - i. s. in late September or early October 1975..1
1.4 There is a need to consider what would be a valid basis onwhich that &quot;final say&quot; of the British people can be expressed:-a. Should cora-pulsory voting (33 in Australia) be considered?This would involve a major departure from electoral practice:it would be complicated to implement, and difficult to enforce;and it would introduce a further controversial political issue.b. Should a minimum -proportion (say, 30 per cent, as in Denmark)of the total electorate be required to vote?If the total poll turned out to be well below 50 per cent, andthe majority - whether for remaining in the Community or with-drawing from it - was only just over 50 per cent, could theresult be regarded as valid?   She risk of a low poll may be small;   that was not the experience in Ireland, Denmark or Norway.c. Irrespective of the size of the poll, can the result reston a simnle majority?There are tv;o factors.   First, a relatively small allowance ofno more than 1 per cent would be needed if it was thought necessary to provide for some unavoidable inaccurac3r in the count.Thi.3 would suggest that a simple majority might be expressed as:&quot;51 per cent of those voting&quot;.   The second, and more difficult,factor is whether something greater than a bare majority shouldbe required to validate &quot;the final say&quot;?   There are no clearalternative criteria, although 60 per cent and 75 per centmight be obvious options.t2
d.     Should any special provision bo made for taxing accountof the results in Scotland. !fales and Northern Ireland?A difficult situation could arise if the United Kingdom results were finely balanced, and it were knovm that, for example,Scotland had registered a strong majority in one direction.The Scottish Nationalists may press for a commitment that a binding majority should involve a majority in Scotland as wellas the whole United Kingdom.     (See also Chapter 3 for discussionof the question whether regional results should be made known evenif the &quot;final say&quot; depends only on a bare United Kingdom majority.)1,5   If it is decided to adopt one of the special criteria mentionedin b. c. and d. of the preceding paragraph, so that the &quot;final say&quot; is determined on a stricter basis than a bare United Kingdom majority ofone, the same stricter basis would presumably- apply either to staying* in or to withdrawal.   If, for instance, the majority had to be at least60 per cent, a 59 per cent, vote in favour of withdrawal would be just as much an inconclusive result as a 59 per cent vote in favour ofstaying   in.1.6   But, if the required basis is anything except a bare United Kingdommajority, even of 1 vote, it is necessary to consider how to deal withthe situation in which a referendum failed to produce a conclusiveresult.   This would be particularly likely if a high criterion were established.   If a 75 per cent vote were needed to take us out of theCommunity and there were a 70 per cent vote in that direction; thaanti-marketeers would not be content with our remaining in.   Unless itwas thought right to hold another referendum, it is for consideration whether the issue should be left to Parliament in such cireumsranees,.3(CONFIDENTIAL.)
-CcoJFIDgWJAp)POLITICAL AND PARLIASEBTAffiT IT-TLICATOTS OF BEDIITG COMMIT!!;??1.7   However these questions are settled, there will be the politicaland Parliamentary implications of the referendum result.   following the terms of the October Manifesto the Prime Minister made clear toParliament on 14 November (Hansard Volume 881, col 589) that theGovernment would accept the decision of the British people, whatever it was.1.8   No special action would be necessary if the referendum resultwere in favour of continuing Community membership.   But. if theresult required withdrawal, subsequent action would fall into threedistinct, though inter-related, parts:-a. Negotiations with the CommunityWe should need to negotiate our way out of the Treaty of Accessica;establishing by negotiation the new relationship we would wish toestablish, in trade and other areas, with the &quot;Community...b. Revision of Domestic PoliciesWe should need to review and revise domestic policies, particular!consequences of withdrawal.c.     LegislationWe should need to repeal the European Communities Act aftercompleting a., a.nd we should have to make substantial legislativeadjustments to cover b.i i1.9 This report is not concerned with a. and b. above, except to saythat, while contingency planning can be done between the completion ofin respect of agriculture and trade, in order to reflect the4
(s CONFIDENTIAL )renegotiation and the holding.of the referendum, adequate time -perhaps up to a year - would ha needed to complete our finalwithdrawal from the Community on the &quot;best conditions we could obtainand to reorient our policies.1.10 As to c., the Government will need to consider:-a. Whether there be advantage in the Referendum Bill making provision for the automatic repeal of the European CommunitiesAct either immediately following the referendum result or after a specified period of, say, 12 months?     Orb. whether the Government should retain complete room for manoeuvre as to Parliamentary action until after the referendumresult is knovm and we can fully assess the requirements of the consequential Community negotiations and of the revision of domestic policies?1.11 As to the alternative at a. above, it would not be practicable to provide for instant automatic repeal.   This would mean, for example,that there would be no satisfactory statutory provision for areas suchas agricultural support now dependent upon Community membership.Complicated legislation would have to be prepared and enacted.    Thesecond option of delayed repeal might create a smaller risk of a breach of our international obligations and allow time for consequentialdomestic legislation;   and it would offer the potential advantage ofentrenching firmly the referendum result.   Against this, hov/ever, sucha provision in the Bill would be a complicating factor, likely to lead5
(CONFiDENTJAL.)to awkward political repercussions in the Community;   and it wouldnot eliminate the need for the supplementary and consequentiallegislation that would he likely to be required in addition to the repeal of the European Comnmnities Act.-Summary of Questions1.12   SHOULD VOTING BE COMPULSORY?1,13   SHOULD A MINIMUM PROPORTION OP THE TOTAL ELECTORATE BE REQUIREDFOR A DECISIVE RESULT?-1,14   SHOULD THE RESULT BE DECIDED BY A SIMPLE MAJORITY?1.15   SHOULD PROVISION BE MADE FOR A FAILURE TO ACHIEVE A CONCLUSIVE1.16 SHOULD ANY SPECIAL PROVISION BE MADE FOR REGIONAL RESULTS?1.17   SHOULD THE RESULT BE ENTRENCHED BY LEGISLATION?RESULT?6
(Confidential.)Chapter 2; THE QUESTION2.1   The terms of the question to be posed in the referendum will be widely expected to have a significant - even crucial - effect onthe outcome&apos;.   They are bound to be controversial.    It would bedifficult to establish any consensus on what constitutes a &quot;fair&quot;or &quot;neutral&quot; question.   There may well be partisan attempts to demonstrate that one wording is fairer than another, and to discreditthe wording proposed by the Government,Policy Issues2.2   The February Manifesto said:&quot;If renegotiations do not succeed.....   We shall.....put to theBritiEh people the reasons why we find the new terras unacceptable,and consult them on the advisability of negotiating.our with-drawal from the Communities.&quot;2.3   The October Manifesto said:&quot;.....we will give the British people the final say, which willbe binding on the Government - through the ballot box - on whether we accept the terms and stay in or reject the terms and come out.&quot;2.4   The central issue of policy is whether the question should seek agreement to a course recommended by the Government (to stay in orcome out of the Community, depending on the outcome of renegotiation):or whether it should seek a view on whether or not we should remainmembers.   This touches the nature and purpose of the referendumitself.    In considering the two alternative approaches, Ministers
(&quot;CONFIDENTIAL -)will wish to bear in mind that:.a. In his statement to the Council of Ministers on A June 1974;the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that &quot;in submittinthe results of renegotiation to the British t)eoplef we shall make clear our-verdict on what has been achieved.&quot;   this statement did not imply that the government&apos;s verdict wouldbe embodied in the referendum question.     However the termsof the February Manifesto might be taken to imply that, ifrenegotiation failed, the referendum question would indicate the Government*s recommendation.b. Other Member States will have a major interest in theGovernment*s verdict and in the way the verdict is expressedin the referendum question.   They may seek our assurances onthis before renegotiation is comploted.c. It may be argued that a question seeking agreement to aGovernment recommendation is less 1neutral1 than a questionseeking a view on the merits of membership.    Organisationsopposed to UK membership, for example, have already made itclear that they favour the latter.   They may argue that itwould be inappropriate on political and constitutionalgrounds for the Government&apos;s own orooosal, rather than theprinciple of Community membership as such, to be made theissue in the referendum.d. Foreign referenda normally pose fairly neutral questions,although Governments may campaign strongly for one resultrather than another.8
( GQNFlDENTtA2.5   A separate, but related, issue if? whether the question should refer directly to the renegotiated terms.    Again it might be argued that this would tend to bias the result or to obscure the fundamentalissue; but some reference in the question to the new terms - whichwould not necessarily involve a reference to the Government&apos;s verdicton renegotiation - seems implicit in the Manifesto commitment togive the people the final say &quot;on whether we accept the terms andstay in, or reject the terms and come out.&quot;2.6   If the question refers to the new terms, it is for consideration whether it should refer to a published document setting out the newterms.   Such a document will presumably be needed whatever the formof the question, and it does not seem essential to refer to it inthe question even if the question refers to the terms.2.7   A third issue is whether the voters should be asked to chooseone of two alternatives, or whether they should be asked to say &quot; es&quot;or &quot;no&quot; to a single proposition.   A yes/no approach could be used toput the onus for achieving a majority on those who wish for changeor who wish to oppose the Government&apos;s verdict on the outcome of renegotiation.   And the option approach might be open to criticism on the grounds that the options specified on the ballot paper wereconfusing, or did not fairly represent the choice bafore the voter.On the other hand, the terras of the October Manifesto point towardsputting the two alternatives directly to the people.2.8   There would ceem to b8 no advantage in contemplating more than two alternatives.   Any number of choices might theoretically be offered, but a third or fourth option would be open to criticism9

CONFIDENTIAL jTiming and the bill.16 Parliament can be expected to wish to debate the terms of thequestion.    It follows that the question will have to be includedin the referendum bill rather than in a statutory instrument whichwould not be open to amendment.   This has : .       implications forthe nature and timing of the bill.    If the question were to reflect the Government&apos;s verdict on the outcome of renegotiation, the bill could not be introduced before March or April at the earliest andthe option-, of introducing an early bill soon after the ChristmasrecesE would be closed.    If, on the other hand, the question wereposed in &quot;neutral&apos; terras which made no explicit reference to theGovernment*s verdict, Ministers might be able to settle the wordingbefore the completion of renegotiation.   A questioii on these linesmight be embodied in an early bill and so would leave open the option of the faster timetable outlined in paragraph 7*4 below.2.17 Subject to Parliament, the Government will wish to considerkeeping the final decision on the terras of the question in its own hands.   But Ministers will be pressed to accept advice on the wording from a variety of outside interests, including the political parties and other organisations with strong views on the membershipissue.    In particular, there may be pressure in Parliament for thequestion to be referred to a Select Committee.   This would be likelyto take the framing of the question (ond probably the timetable forthe referendum as a whole) out of the Government&quot;s control.Summary &apos;:l -2.18 SHOULD THE QUESTION SEEK AGREEMENT TO A COURSE RECOMMENDED BYTHE GOVERNMENT?(j^ONFJDFJ^TlALj

Chapter 3:   pRGAKISATIOIF AND COUNTING OP THE POLL3.1   The machinery used for local and parliamentary elections can beused for the referendum with necessary adaptations.   (This approach was adopted for the Northern Ireland Border Poll).   The electorate couldsimilarly be that for a general election, plus peers.  &apos;The main problems arising arc considered below and other points of lesser importance-including a detailed discussion of the electorate, are considered in annex BoPolling and the Count3.2   The major policy question is whether figures will be made available on anything other than a total United Kingdom basis*   What the regionswill seek is special influence on the result -- for example, a Governmentcommitment that a binding decision would require a majority in scotland as well as the total United Kingdom (see Chapter 1).   If the government does not concede a special status to the results for individual regions,separate disclosure of the figures will still be sought as a means ofexerting subsequent pressure on the Government.   The publication of onlya-total&apos;United Kingdom result would&quot;be designed to diminish the tensionswhich otherwise might arise from a situation in which, for example, itwas known that England had voted in one direction and that Scotland, Wales :and Northern Ireland had tipped the balance in the opposite direction.   The.most extreme difficulty would, perhaps, arise if Northern Ireland alonehad tipped the balance.3.3   The question is therefore whether the arguments are good enough todefend a. decision to withhold regional results.   There are strong arguments in both directions.   On the one hand, the United Kingdom basis
reflects the unique nature of a Referendum designed to answer a singlequestion affecting the long term future of the whole country.   Normalelections are for local representatives and therefore properly reflectlocal and regional differences; the referendum is an expression ofnational opinion.3.4 On the other hand, it can he argued that maximum information ofinterest to the public should be provided.   Community membership affectsdifferent regions in different ways and they are entitled to be heard.It is the almost universal practice abroad to publish local results by1natural&apos; electoral units such as French departments New Zealandconstituencies and American precincts.3.5   Inevitably surveys will be carried out by interested parties and impartial researchers of voting intentions and, if there is no official.breakdown of the results, of how people say they actually voted.   the referendum is susceptible to easy and accurate sampling.   Even if therewere bans on polls, foreign organisations could readily mount and publis:surveys before polling day and domestic organisations could mount them as soon as any ban expired.   It is for consideration whether it is betteto have strong^ but unvalidated, survey evidence that different countriesor regions turned the result or to publish the official figures.organisation.6   Votes would be cast at local Polling Stations in the normal way.If the normal counting arrangements are used, this would have to takeplace in each local area.   A large number of people would be involved,most of whom would have access to the local total.   There is nothing in present electoral lav; to make those totals- secret.   Kany of thoseinvolved in the count may well consider that the public have a right toknovj the local results.    Accordingly the only way to seek to prevent
&quot;the disclosure of accurate information would be to make it a criminal offence.   This would be a particularly controversial course.   A decisionto publish only a single United Kingdom total could therefore be implemented only by a centralised count.3.7   It would be obvious that a national count would be undertaken only with the intention of obscuring area differences.   It would be complicated and expensive to organise.   While a computer count could be organised, thetime needed to instal and debug such a system must not be underestimatedand there would be a risk of a fiasco.   It is therefore necessary toconsider the transport of all ballot boxes to a counting centre, withpolice or Service escorts from areas such as Ulster.   Checking of fraudwould be difficult, if not impossible, and. this could become an issue ina close result.   A manual count would take several days (with anextension of this period for any recount) particularly since practisedstaff such as bank clerks could probably not be retained for the periodconcerned.   Further work would be needed on the practicability, costand timescale of a national count, if Ministers wish to consider thisoption further.   A tentative &quot;guesstimate&quot; is that 700C or more counterswould be needed for a 2-day count and 50*000 ballot boxes would haveto be handled.   If it were proceeded with, it would be a major executivetask and might appropriately be organised and carried out by an Agency(Chapter 5 bslow).3.8   The local level already used for elections offers a choice between local government districts and parliamentary constituencies.   A countby local government districts is somewhat easier to organise and in a fairly high proportion of cases obscures parliamentary constituencyresults.   This might be regarded as either an advantage or disadvantage.The constituency level would be only slightly more difficult to organise, jIt would highlight whether a constituency and its HP were in agreement on the issue and enable it to be seen afterwards: whether the Member spoke
and voted in accordance with his constituents&apos; views.   He could, for&apos; example, argue that he was justified in opposing the implementation of thnational result if his constituents had voted in a different sense.3o9   There is no real advantage in either county or regional counting.This would involve the establishment of new machinery; somewhat slow doxsthe count but still highlight variations within the United Kingdom.The Channel Isles and Isle of Man3.10   The Government would, in the event of withdrawal, need to take into account the views of the governments of the Channel Islands and the isle of Man, with the object of obtaining for them, as for theUnited- Kingdom, the best possible -withdrawal terms.   The highlyfavourable arrangements that they at present enjoy would inevitably lapsehowever, as a consequence of the withdrawal of the member stateresponsible for their external relations.   Whether to hold referendain their territories (whose total population is rather more than180,000) would be a matter for the Island governments to determine.HMG would need to indicate to them, however, to what extent, if any, theresults of such referenda would be taken into account.   It could be argued that to aggregate Island votes with our own would beunconstitutional and unfair to the United Kingdom, and that the existenceof different terms could render aggregation meaningless.   It could a?.sobe argued, however, that to disregard Island votes would be unfair totheir people.   The Island governments were giver, an assurance by theprevious administration that if, having considered the terms, they didnot wish to become a part of the Community they would not be forced into it.   Their legislatures eventually voted overwhelmingly in favour of acceptance of the terms.   Since the referendum would be binding on Hi&apos;Gsthe onljr means whereby any true account could be taken of Island   views18v.     i  p.n h\ rfi b ?r Mr 1 a!  ^
(&quot;confidential&quot;&quot;)on this occasion would he by offering to aggregate, with our own theresults of comparable referenda held by them.   A difficult decision is involved between these two cases.   The necessity for special arrangementsfor the Islands will inevitably be quoted by advocates of a local ratherthan national basis for the count.Unofficial Polls &apos; 13.11 The 1965-68 Speaker&apos;s Conference proposed an embargo on thepublication of unofficial poll results for the period of 72 hours endingwith the close of polls.   Parliament rejected this recommendation, partly because of the risk of evasion and partly because of doubt as to whetherthe polls had any influences   It would be difficult to justify adifferent approach for the referendum, particularly if a longer period before polling day were in question and the major departure of including a period after polling day were also proposed.   The risks of evasion arehigh and it is very difficult to justify the limitation of freedom*involved, particularly, in terms of any post-poll ban.3.12   Nevertheless, it can be argued that a referendum is so different from a general election that a ban might be imposed.   The risks of undueinfluence may be greater without the normal anchors of a familiar localcandidate, of a range of issues and of traditional allegiances.   Themain possibility to be considered might be a ban for a campaign period ofsay, 4 weeks up to the poll.Summary3-13        SHOULD THE COUNT BE ON A LOCAL OR CENTRAL BASIS?3.14        IP LOCAL, ON A LOCAL GOVERNMENT DISTRICT, PARLIAMENTARYCONSTITUENCY OR COUNTY BASIS?3.15        IP LOCAL, SHOULD THE INEVITABILITY OP PUBLISHING LOCAL RESULTSBE ACCENTED PROM THE BEGINNING?3.16        SHOULD THE PUBLICATION OP THE.RESULTS OP UNOFFICIAL POLLS BEBANNED FOR A PERIOD BEFORE THE POLL?19

4.1   A reasoned exercise of &quot;the final say&quot; will require the provisionof adequate information about the e.c. and the issues posed by membershipor withdrawal.   The position is complicated by the propaganda issued bythe pro and anti-Market organisations./I4/e2   Two main questions arise for the Government!I       a.   what information role it should play - directly or indirectly.b6   what arrangements if any it should make to control the propaganda activities of outside individuals or organisations.The Oovernraejit8^ Inforrnation Role&quot;i4.3   An informed decision involves information on two areas.a.   The outcome of the renegotiation:   how the terms of membershiphave been revised and the likely effect,b., General information about the e.c. and the implications ofbeing within or outside the Community.4*4   .T,n.^^?^A&quot;&quot;^-ra^.0^-A^.e. ,0,&apos;u^colCT.ell ,0-, r en e got i at ion,   must await its completion and the Governments verdict.   There will inevitably beParliamentary debate and probably a White Paper setting out the terms.In this the Government will take the lead.4*5   As to the need for more general information   about the Community,there have been recent reports of an opinion survey showing that three-quarters of the public consider that they have inadequateinformation.   A considerable effort was made-by the previous government during the period leading up to entry.   Annex A shows that the-Daiiish,Irish Republic and Norwegian Governments mounted large efforts and spentsums of money which, in proportion to population, were equivalent tospending between  5 and  1$ million in this country.   Since theGovernment have decided that the people should have the final say,
they could be criticised if the information effort were not commensurate with the task.   A preliminary assessment, taking account of foreignexperience, points to the need for a major programme starting as soonas possible.   It suggests that it will be too late when the outcome of renegotiation is known.   Information is needed not just on the main issues, but also on specialised regional and occupational preoccupationsiTo leave the information role to the competing pro and anti Marketorganisations - if the Government were to contemplate this course -&apos;would be a recipe for confusion and misunderstanding.h-,,6   But if the Government should take direct responsibility for providing information the following problems and questions would arise:a. .   However the task were organised in Whitehall, Ministers wouldbe responsible for every action, including the terms of texts,,b. However the information were presented, it Y/ould be difficultto provide neutral information over much of the wide area thatwill legitimately interest the public.   Even facts abouttariffs and budgets can be contested.c. Should the Government provide both pro and anti-market arguments?In Australia, Referendum proposals have to be supported bystatementa of 2,000 words each of both sides of the case.   Ihtheir e.c. referendum, the Norwegians produced a &quot;joint electionaddress&quot; which set out the two cases to the satisfaction of theantagonists.   The consideration of this possibility will be influenced by the Government&apos;s attitude to the result of the referendum.d. How extensive an effort should be made?   It would seem essentialto contemplate a wide campaign of pamphlets, lectures? TV andradio programmes, visits to Brussels etc.22
k-o7   Consideration of these problems leads to the possibility that thetask might be given to an independent, but publicly financed agency.This could take the day-to-day decisions and move faster and more flexiblythan the normal Government machine.   The Government could not expect toavoid some involvement.   A Minister would be responsible for the %appointment of the Chairman,;?.and any major dispute would probably reach the floor of the House one way or another.   But the amount of Governmentinvolvement should be much reduced, particularly in the early stages ofa campaign.Control^ of hiformation and Propagandas Ac;bj^yities4.8   There is also a need to consider the possibility of introducingmachinery for controlling the information and propaganda activitiesof outside partisans of both sides04o9   Both the BBC, by its charter, and the ITA, by statute, are requiredto maintain a proper balance in the subject matter of programmesbroadcast and televised.   This is normally achieved by ordinaryeditorial policy.4,10 In the case of political broadcasts, particularly for the periodof a general election campaign, machinery exists for the two authoritiesand the main political parties to determine the allocation of time and related matters.   On the political side these arrangements are in thehands of the Y/hipa Office.   At meetings at which, these matters are discussed Ministers representing the government party are present intheir political rather than their Ministerial capacity.
4*11   The application of these arrangements to a referendum would not seem.toraise any fundamental new issue of principle.   There are however bound to be anumber of difficulties.   The two sides are likely to expect to be given time topresent their ca.se on the analogy, of Party political broadcasts.   There will bea problem in maintaining a balance because there may be a number of separategroups on either side all with slightly different points of view.   The political parties themselves may seek to be specially treated.   In any case the relationship of Party political broadcasts (and also Ministerial broadcasts)to the referendum debate may raise difficult questions.4.12   In the absence of special ma.chinery for resolving these issues on the same lines as for Party politice.1 broadcasts, the basic responsibility for mairi-taining a proper balance would rest on the two broadcasting authorities.Nevertheless, despite the well-recognised tradition that the Government doesnot intervene in any matter affecting programme content, there may well be pressure for the Government to take a lead in resolving these issues..   It willbe important to maintain in public the position that the responsibility forthese problems rests on the broadcasting authorities, but this would not rule out informal consultation between Ministers and the two Chairmen.&apos;4.13   Particular difficulty may arise over paid advertisements and other formsof jpjxid propaganda.   Concern is being expressed about the possibility of the anti-ma.market case being swamped by massive pro-market expenditure financedlargely by industry.   Analogies are drawn with the control of expenditure by parliamentary candidates;   but the problem of control in a referendum is complicated by the absence of local candidates who have both rights and responsibilities, (and national party expenditure is not controlled in general elections)u   Ministers will need to consider this area.   The two possibleapproaches are control of activities and the provision of finance to even theodds.24 ;
Control-  4*14   Any control of the activities of the many organisations and individuals that might wish to pay for propaganda would raise major questions of principle about freedom of expression.   Also, it wouldseem impracticable to devise a fool-proof system of comprehensive controlextending to all forms of paid propaganda at all levels.   There would,for instance, be a major problem in defining the propaganda subject tocontrol, since the e.c. issue can be related to many political and other questions.4.15   0ne approach would be to recognise the impossibility of fully effective control and to take no action in this area.   Political pressure for achieving some degree of apparent fairness will, however, be strong.Possible approaches include the following:-i.   The jdeolarat1on of a camp ai gn period,   during which someactivities might be forbidden and others regulated.   legislation would be needed for anything other than a voluntary &quot;code&quot;observed by both sides.   If it were desired to forbid or controlactivities before the campaign period, the timing of the referendum Bill could be crucial. .&apos; &apos;iie   Speoial jprpyision for aptiyities by firms.   This is an area, thatattracts particular attention.   It might be desired to preventdirect advertising by firms, and even to prevent or control thei:isfinancing of pro or anti e.c. bodies. This would be technicallyas well as politically difficult, and we have not discussed the.implications with the Department of Trade.25( COMF1 DENTIAL &quot;1
iiio Restrictions on particular f^orins-of propaganda, eg on posterand TV campaigns and newspaper advertisements0   any restrictions would have to be detailed and precise.   It wouldnot seem possible to operate by setting total financial limits :for the two sidesaiv0   It is possible, but perhaps unlikely, that reputable org&amp;nisa-tions on the two sides could be brought to agree on a voluntary;code of practice.,   But a voluntary code could not cover thefringe organisations.4o16 But ii* and iii. of the preceding paragraphs would require statutoryforce if they were to be effective and enforceable.   They would thereforedepend for their operation on the timing of the Referendum Bill and could probably not start operating until the Bill became law - perhaps&apos; as little as a month before polling day0 vGovernment Finance4o17 Either in place of -or in addition to attempting to control propagandaactivities, the Government might wish to consider providing public financeto the protagonists.   Any such provision could be controversial.   Itwould be likely to involve giving public money to at least someorganisations that did not need it.   A major decision would be whether there should be a fixed sum or open ended finance of approved activities.&apos;The selection of recipients in the absence of parties would be a majox-problem o   Legislation would probably be needed.   A conceivable approach would be to provide funds for a &quot;package1! of activities by both sidesincluding for example, the distribution of &quot;election address&quot; literatureand the production of &quot;election broadcasts&quot; television programmes.26
Organisation I;  &apos;4*18   If a regulatory ands possibly* financing function were to be performed, the question of the appropriate organisation would arise*One approach would be to operate on a normal basis within government can alternative would be to use an independent agency, which might be combined with the information role discussed earlier in this Chapters .&quot;Whatever the arrangements finally made clear guidelines laid down bythe Government will still be necessary.Summary4.19   SHOULD A LONG AND EXTENSIVE INFORMATION CAMPAIGN BE MOUNTED?4.20   IP SO, SHOULD THE POSSIBILITY OP USING AN OUTSIDE AGENCY be explored FURTHER?4.21   ARE SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS NEEDED FOR TV AND RADIO TIME comparable to ELECTION BROADCASTS &apos;. 4c 22   SHOULD THE POSSIBILITY&quot; OF CONTROLLING SOME PAID PROPAGANDA&apos; ACTIVITIES BE FURTHER EXPLORED?4c23   SHOULD THE QUESTION OF GOVERNMENT FINANCE FOR DEFINED ACTIVITIESBE -FURTHER EXPLORED?
Chapter 5:   ORGANISATION OF REFERENDA TASKS;   POSSIBLE INDEPENDENT AGENCIES5.1 The preceding Chapters of the Report have identified the following additional functions made necessary by a decision to hold a Referendum:i.     the dissemination of information, including the period before the outcome of renegotiation is known (Chapter 4)ii.     the operation of any rules that may be introduced for thecontrol of publicity activities by the pro and anti--marketorganisations (and possibly the pr&amp;vision of public finance for approved PR activites) (Chapter k)iii.     the organisation of the referendum itself, particularly ifthere is a central count.   (Chapter 3)*5.2   All of this work could be handled by the normal governmentalma-chine.   The organisation of the referendum, in particular, wouldbe a modest job for central Government if there were no central count,The discussion of the tasks at i. and ii. above have, however, indicate the possible advantages of avoiding day-to-day Ministerial responsibiliiby using outside agencies.5.3   There need not necessarily be only one agency.   Different functionsare involved.   The running of the central count eto must be seen to beimpartial whereas the information function would inevitably be open to challenge and may lead to considerable controversy,,
POSSIBLE LEGISLATION .;    -5.4   Formal independence from Ministerial control could be achieved ifthe Agencies were set up by legislation or had, for example, the status of Royal Commissions.   Considerable practical independence would beachieved by purely administrative action in selecting a man or men whowould carry conviction and announcing that they would have day-to-dayindependence.   The production of information material and the operationof any voluntary control arrangements would not necessarily needlegislation:   expenditure could fall on departmental Votes.   Statutoryregulation of information activities and the provision of funds tooutside organisations would probably require legislation whether the function was performed by a Department or an agency.TIMING5.5   This leads to difficult questions of timing.   The informationeffort should begin as soon as possible and no legislation is needed.Unless special legislation were contemplated, statutory control of PRactivities and probably the disbursal of public money to outsideorganisations could not begin until the Referendum Bill were enacted.MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY5.6   Although it should be possible to achieve recognition of theday-to-day independence of the agencies, Ministers would still besubject to questioning and political pressure in the areas covered.In the case of regulatory activities, the Government would almost certainly have to give detailed guidance, perhaps amounting toprecise rules, subject to parliamentary discussion.
STAFFING5.7     It would be difficult to find a good Chairman.   Few appropriatpeople have no public views on Europe and an Agency which sought to balance pro and anti members might not work very veil.   Skilledstaff such as professional journalists would be needed for theinformation function, but the supporting staff, particularly forthe executive work would probably have to be drawn from the CivilService.f-,:.;r-r::-:- .&apos;:,r.- :.     &apos; &apos; &apos;&apos;::-!!&apos;&apos;&apos;;&apos;SUMMARY5.8     WOULD MINISTERS WISH FURTHER WORK TO BE.

Chapter 6:    THE REFERENDUM BILL &quot;-&apos;    &apos;CONTENT -6.1   The essential content of the Referendum Bill will he provisionsabout the organisation of the referendum.   These provisions will -a. make detailed modifications of the machinery laid downin the present law on elections (Chapter 3 and Annex B);b. authorise the necessary expenditure;c. if Ministers so decided, provide for an independent agency to organise a central count (Chapters 3 &amp;nd 5).It seems unavoidable that the Bill should also -d. W prescribe the form of the question on the ballot paper(Chapter 2).6.2   A Bill on these lines will probably raquire about a dozen clauses.Provision will also have to be made - either in a Schedule to the Bill,or by subsequent statutory instrument - for detailed modifications ofexisting law and prescribed forms.6.3   Ministers may wish to consider a number of supplementary measureswhich might be taken to regulate and facilitate the campaign.   depending on the decisions Ministers take on these posibilities, the Bill could also -t.a,     lay down rules governing -i.    advertisements (Chapter 4)ii.     the spending of money on the campaign (eg by firms)(Chapter 4)31
confidential)iii.   the holding of unofficial polls (chapter 3)b. provide for grants from public funds to the organisationsinvolved in the campaign (Chapter 4)c. set up an independent agency to superintend a. and/or b.(Chapter 5)d. set up an agency to provide objective information about the issues (though such an agency could be set up without legislation (Chapter 5))*6.4 But if rules about advertisements and the spending of money were to operate during the whole of the campaign, the Bill would need to receivethe Royal Assent in good time before the date of the Referendum.6.4a If Ministers decided that it was sufficient that the bindingcharacter of the referendum should rest on the political commitment of the Government to honour it, no provision would be needed in theBill laying down the nature of the majority which would be binding(Chapter 1).   But provision would be needed if it were decided to&quot;entrench&quot; the result by providing for automatic statutory consequencesif the decision was in favour of withdrawal from the e.c. (Chapter 1).Passage through Parliament6.5   The Bill may prove contentious in Parliament and expensive in termsof Parliamentary time.   Being a constitutional measure, all stages will presumably have to be taken on the floor of the House of Commons.   TheHouse of Lords could be particularly difficult, especially if they considered that the question on the ballot paper was slanted in favourof withdrawal from the e.c..   Even if the Lords did not reject the Billoutright, they might insist on amendments (eg to the form of the question)which the Government would find it difficult to accept.32
)6.6     Parliamentary time is likely to &quot;be at a premium during thelatter stages of the 1974-75 session because of the build-up atthat stage of a considerable number of complex and contentiousBills.   Congestion in the House of Lords during the period shortly before the summer recess seems likely to be particularly serious.Sponsorship6.7     It is necessary to decide which Minister will be responsiblefor the legislation and how he is to be supported at official level.There will be great advantage in taking these decisions at the stage of formulating the policy of the Bill, even if the Bill isnot introduced for some months.6.8     It seems clear that a senior Cabinet Minister must be incharge of the preparation of the Bill and of its handling inParliament.   (A senior Minister will also need to handle theBill in the House of Lords.)   The senior Minister in charge would no doubt require the assistance of a junior Minister or ministers, at any rate while the Bill was in Parliament.6.9     Much of the legislation will be concerned with the machinery and organisation of the referendum, and this will be within theHome Office area of responsibility.   But the Parliamentary debates33
fIALwill also cover the general constitutional issues&apos;raised &quot;by theBill, and the particular question of whether there are adequate safeguards to ensure a fair campaign *   The Foreign and commonwealth office will be concerned with the e.c. aspects underlying   some ofthe major policy issues, including the form of the question on the ballot paper.6.10 If a Departmental Minister were in overall charge, he would presumably derive his main support from his own Department,working in close consultation with the other Departments coucerr:2drincluding the Cabinet Office.     If a non-Departmental minister were in charge, it might be necessary for the official support- tobe provided by a special unit set up centrally which drew its staff (both administrative and legal) from the Departments withdirect responsibility.     v6.11 If a non-Departmental Minister were in charge, he might also need the assistance of junior Departmental Ministers while the1 Sillwas going through Parliament.Summary of questions6,12 WHICH MINISTER IS TO BE.Ill CHiRCS OF THE BILL?6.13 ARE SPSCIAL ARRANGEMENTS NEEDED FOR OFFICIAL SUPPORT?
Chapter 7:   THE TIMETABLE7.1 In the period between now and the referendum, it is necessaryto fit in at least five separate processes, with overlapping time-scales and major points of interaction.   They are -ac     The renegotiation.   We hope that the renegotiation will becompleted by the middle or end of March, but the timetable maywell slip, i Last minute Ministerial or even Summit meetings canbe envisaged.   After the renegotiation within the Community hasbeen concluded, the Government will need to decide on theirverdict.   Until the Governments attitude can be made known, tworelated processes could be held up:   one, the formulation of the ballot paper question and therefore the introduction and passageof the Bill, and, secondly, the public campaign, since this willbe about the terms as well as other issues.be     The preparation of the referendum machinery.   detailed planning will have to start as soon as possible, and part of itcan be carried out while the Bill is in Parliament.   But in viewof the holiday season and the Parliamentary recess an Octoberreferendum would require that the Bill received the Royal Assentby the end of July.   The holiday season probably means that an earlier referendum could riot take place later than June,   royal assent could be needed by the end of April for a June referendum.c     The Bill.   Three months may be the minimum time likely to be needed in Parliament.   The Bill would have to be introduced by not later than the end of April for an October referendum.   A35

The campaign.   Chapter 4 underlines the need, for a lengthyinformation effort if an informed result is to emerge from the referendum.   This effort should be launched as early aspossible, but its major phase cannot start until after the renegotiation has been concluded and the Government&apos;s attitude!is known. . ,e. The continuing business of the Community is at any tinelikely to throw up serious issiies affecting the situation.

Becausethe Bill will&apos; be36
17.2   Perhaps the logical sequence is - renegotiation, the announce-meni of the Government&apos;s attitude, the introduction and passage ofthe Referendum Bill, the campaign, the referendum.   But to leavethe start of each stage until the end of the previous stage would clearly put at risk the Manifesto commitment to hold the referendumby October 1975.7.3   Ministers may therefore like to concentrate initially on twotimetable options:-Option A:     Introduction of the Bill at the end of April.Option B.:     Introduction of the Bill as soon as possible inthe Hew Year.OPTION A7.4   If the Bill were introduced at the end of April;-a. Although the renegotiation itself ought to have beencompleted by then, there might not have been sufficient timefor the Government to be ready to announce their attitude.There could still be difficulty with formulating the question on the ballot paper.b. But the renegotiation itself ought not to be adversely affected.c. Royal Assent by the start of the summer recess might notbe easy to achieve - and certainly not without some serious risk to the rest of the Government&apos;s legislation.    If Royal Assentwere not achieved by the summer recess, an October referendumwould not be practicable unless Parliament came back to finishthe Bill during the recess.37

It would then be difficult to include a reference to the new terms.     Since other Community Governmentshope strongly that the Government will recommend the new terns,this could have an adverse effect on the final stages of renegotiation.b. Apart from the form of the question, the renegotiationmight also be adversely affected by the introduction of the Billc. Ministers might find it difficult to commit themselves tothe detailed content of the Bill before the renegotiation hadbeen completed.

r^CONFlDENTIAlANNEX BORGANISATION OP RSF3EBNBUK; ADDITIONAL points.     Given that the. ordinary electoral machinery should be used,considerable adaptation will be needed.   The bulk of this will betechnical, but there are some features, in addition to the major issues discussed in Chapter 3 which raise questions of policy.SCRUTINY OP ARRANGEMENTS2,     The scrutiny of an election is normally entrusted very largely to the candidates end their agents.    In their absence the NorthernIreland Border Poll made provision for observers appointed by theSecretary of State.   This was primarily designed to give representativesof the different parties a formal role in the oversight of arranga-ments; it could also serve for the appointment of staff independentboth of the protagonists and of local government.    It seems desirable.to follow this precedent for the e.c. poll.   There are two kinds of possible irregularities: administrative faii\;re on the part of theofficial machine and deliberate improprieties on the part of thevoters.   As the machine will be the responsibility of local govern-ment it seems desirable that observers should be drawn from adifferent quarter.   Although there is a strong tradition of avoidingcivil service involvement in elections, at least a proportion in this special case may have to be drawn from the civil service.   Independentscrutiny might, however, be a responsibility of the Agency discussed in Chapter 5eCHALLENGE OP RESULT3.     Extensive provision exists for the challenge of elections throughthe courts.   If the result of a referendum were to be legally binding52
cin any tray it would be difficult to avoid making similar provision.unacceptable.   If the result is to be politically rather than legally binding, it is less clear that provision for final verification is needed and this points to excluding the possibility of formal challenge.Nevertheless, there may well be allegations of error, impropriety orirregularity, particularly if the results were close.4.     At an election a candidate or his agent may require a recount butthe returning officer nay refuse this if he thinks the request isiinreasonable.   There are objections to reproducing this for a&apos; referendum.   It would have to be decided who might apply for a recountand whether this should only be on specific grounds and what these should be.   If the count were local the narrowness of a local result would hardly be a grotmd, since this would be of no relevance to thenational total.   A significant error might just as easily have occurred in a district where there was an overwhelming majority one way or the other.   If there were to be no provision for a recount itis for consideration whether, to be on the safe side, some automaticcheck should be introduced.   This might take the form of, say, arecount of 10 per cent of the votes cast, to be selected by an observer.   There are other alternatives ranging up to requiring a double count for all areas.   If the check disclosed a disparity between the totals provision would be needed for further counts, orfor averaging the results or some other solution.This could, however, be exploited to impose a very considerable delayon the determination of the final result.cSuch a delay may beRECOUNT53
5*     If the count were central, a recount would cause considerable delay but would probably be unavoidable if the result were close.THE ELECTORATE6.    -Paragraph 3.1 of the report envisages that the ordinary electorateshould be entitled to vote, including peers.   That is to say those who/are on the register which is current for the time being and are not otherwise disqualified.   This will disfranchise those who have beenlefb off the register by error;   United Kingdom citizens returning from abroad whose residence did not start until after the qualifyingdate, 10 October;   long-term residents who are not United kingdom citizens;   and United Kingdom citizens resident abroad.   These couldbe enfranchised only by compiling a supplementary register, whichwould have to be subject to the normal procedure of claims andobjections and would also itself have to be subject to a deadline.Such a supplementary register could complicate the conduct of the poll, put an extra burden on the staff involved at a time when the referendum itself will provide novel additional work, increase the potential for error, and create a most awkward precedent in the electoral field.7.     As regards those omitted from the register by error, following a recommendation of Speaker&apos;s Conference a working party is currentlylooking at ways of improving the accuracy of the register, but its recommendations x-ri.ll not be ready soon enough to be acted on for theEuropean Economic Community poll.-54
8.     The other categories who will be disfranchised raise difficultpoints of principle which it would be preferable to avoid having todetermine in the exceptional context of a referendum.   Provision for those resident abroad would, for example, lead to pressure for dealingwith holidaymakers who are unable to vote even though they are on the jregister.9.    Employees of international bodies to which the United KingdomGovernment contributes funds are a particularly &quot;deserving&quot; case and Ithere will no doubt be pressure to enfranchise British employees ofthe Community.ABSENT VOTING FACILITIES10.   In the Northern Ireland Boi^der Poll a postal vote or a proxywas accorded on demand (a change subsequently introduced there forStormont elections).   For Westminster elections Northern Irelandcontinues to be subject to the sane restrictions as the rest of theUnited Kingdom.   The reason for the special Border Poll and S tormentarrangements is to minimise the possibility of intimidation, a factor which does not arise elsewhere in the United Kingdom.   The relaxationwas possible because the electorate is under 1 million and only about 1600,000 voted in the referendum.   To allow absent voting facilities on demand in the United Kingdom as a whole would be likely to resultin applications on a scale which could cause serious administrative difficulties.11. It is true that much longer notice of the date of the poll can &apos;Mgiven than for a general election. This would enable, as a conproais8voting by post on demand to be allowed for all applications received
by, say, not later than 6-8 weeks before the poll, applicationsafter that date being entertainable only if they fell within theexisting grounds.   Even so, this would still give rise to very substantial extra work-, multiplying the scope for abuse (to whichpostal voting is specially open) and set an undesirable precedent for ordinary elections.   It would be desirable to avoid any relaxation-,of the absent voting facilities.POLLING DAY .12.   For elections, bank holidays and Sundays are dies nqn for pollingday.   The possibility of making polling day for a general.election anadditional bank holiday has been considered from time to time but sofar rejected.   The arguments are fairly evenly balanced, some of themore important being the possible difficulty of getting staff to workwhen everyone else was on holiday and the possibility that electorsmight use the occasion to go away rather than vote,   Whatever the weight of these arguments in the context of a permanent electoralchange, the objections seem a good deal weaker in the exceptionalcase of a referendum.   A real possibility would be to make the dayof the Poll a bank holiday.   This would have the added advantage of enabling polling hours to be cut down to say, 8 a.m. to 8 p,m. as for the Irish Border Poll.   This in turn might well make it easier to obtain staff for the poll itself and for invigilation purposes.If Ministers favoured this idea it would need to be pursued.urgentlywith the Treasury, Department of Trade and Department of Eaployiaatit.
cCONHbfcN iiALADMINISTEATIOK13.   Although the &quot;basic electoral machinery will serve for a referendum a number of special modifications will be needed,   a ballot paper will be needed for every elector.   For parliamentaryend local government elections every elector is also sent an officialpoll card.   These have to be individually prepared and where computers,,are used there is a six month delay for the special stationery.    (for elections stocks are kept &quot;topped up&quot; but a new card would be needed for a referendum.)   This card may, therefore, have to be dispersedwith.   In addition a number of the special forms will have to be adapted and reprinted.   It will be for consideration whether someforms can be &quot;deemed&quot; to be appropriate without amendment, but this solution, if it can be used at all, will certainly not serve forevery form.     Guidance will also have to be issued to electoral staffabout the extent, and implications, of the modifications of the, machinery.LEGISLATIVE FORM OF ADAPTATION14.   The administrative requirements described in the previous paragraph impose certain constraints on the nature of the Bill.For the northern Ireland poll, Royal Assent to a short Bill was on   \7 December 1S72, the Order making the adaptations of the electoralmachinery was made on 24 January 1972 and the poll was held on8 March.   But in Northern Ireland the electoral machinery is centralisedand the electorate relatively small.   A similar time-scale would impose aconsiderable  burden on the electoral machine elsewhere in theUnited Kingdom particularly if the time between the mailing of theOrder and the poll fell in the holiday season.57
15*     There may be advantage in scheduling all the adaptations to theBill itself.   The changes would then become operative on Royal Assent.No further parliamentary procedure would be needed.   The longest possiblewarning could be given as the changes would become apparent on thepublication of the Bill;   in this way, too, a good deal of preparatory work could be undertaken in advance of Royal Assent.   Inclusion of the changes in the Bill would enable debates on the machinery to take placein the light of what is actually proposed.   Their omission from the bill might lead to various amendments being tabled for their inclusion inpart or in whole,iSHOULD THERE BE PROVISION FOR OBSERVERS?SHOULD THERE BE PROVISION FOR CHALLENGING THE RESULT?SHOULD THERE BE PROVISION FOR RECOUNTS OR CHECK COUNTSOR BOTH?SHOULD THE ELECTORATE BE THAT FOR A parliamentary election PLUS PEERS?SHOULD ABSENT VOTING FACILITIES BE LIMITED TO THE   .NORMAL GENERAL ELECTION RULES?SHOULD THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING POLLING DAY ANADDITIONAL BANK HOLIDAY BE EXPLORED?SHOULD THE BILL EMBODY THE DETAILED MACHINERY?SUMMARYPARAGRAPH 2346ii      11it       1215
