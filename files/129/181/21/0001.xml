CONFIDENTIALDEFENCE WHITE PAPERCHAPTER ITHE DEFENCE REVIEWTEE REVIEW SO far the Government Is commitment1.     On 21 March ^^^k the Government announced that it had&quot;initiated a review of current defence commitments and capabilitiesagainst the resources that, given the economic prospects of thecountry, we could afford to devote to defence&quot; (Hous^ of Commons,Official Report Vol. 870, No 13 WA Cole. 153 and 15U). The a In of this review was to give effect to the Government!s pledge to achievesavings on defence expenditure of several hundred million poundsper annum over a period while maintaining a modern and effectivedefence system.Background to the Review2.     In the 1968 Supplementary Statement on Defence Policy(Cmnd. 3701) the Labour Government made clear its intention that&quot;Britain&apos;s defence forces, apart from those needed to meet certainresidual obligations to dependent territories,  ...  should ...be concentrated in Europe&quot;.    This remains the Government&apos;s firmpolicy.    But the Conservative Governmenfs 1970 SupplementaryStatement on Defence Policy (Cmnd. 1+521), while accepting that theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) should remain the first - confidential   ,
CONFIDENTIALpriority of defence policy, placed more emphasis on a willingness to counter threats to stability throughout the world.    So whenthe Government came into office in March 197U it inherited a defence programme of world-wide political and military commitments, andmilitary forces stretched to meet those commitments.3.     Within NATO Britain was the only European member to contribute to all the major areas of the Alliance: to the Central Region inEurope, to the Eastern Atlantic and Channel Command areas, to thedefence of the United Kingdom and its immediate approaches,  to the&quot;mediterranean, and to the Alliance&apos;s strategic and tactical nuclear deterrent.    We were also contributing specialist reinforcementforces available for deployment to the Central Region and to thenorthern and southern flanks.4.     Outside NATO Britain was maintaining forces in various partsof the world: in dependent territories,  including those where thepresence of British forces was necessary: Hong Kong,  Gibraltar,the Falkland Islands and Belize; in Cyprus; in the Far East as a contribution to the Five Power Defence   Arrangements; and in anumber of other places, including Brunei, Mauritius, Gan, Oman,and the Caribbean.    These commitments imposed upon Britain an extraburden which none of her European Allies and trading competitors7/as bearing.5.     Forward plans were designed broadly to maintain the existingsize and structure of the forces to provide the capabilities tomeet these commitments.   The cost of these forces was bound toincrease progressively over time to keep pace with the constant1-confidential
development of technology and the growing sophistication of modernweapon systems.    The cost of the planned programme was estimated to increase (at 1974 Survey Prices) from  4,000 million in 1975-76,to  4,070 million in 1976-77,  4,150 million in 1977-78,  4,300million in 1978-79, and an average of  4,450 million in each year from 1979-80 to 1983-84.6.     Throughout the post-war period Britain&apos;s economic performancehas lagged behind that of her major European Allies.    For many yearsour annual average growth rate has been little more than half thatachieved by Prance and the Federal Republic of Germany.    For thisreason and because the economic situation i3 now more serious thanat anytime over the last 25 years, the Government decided thatresources must be released for investment and improving the balanceof payments.    These should be the first calls on our resources in solving our economic problems.   The defence programme, with itsconsiderable demands on skilled manpower and industry, should playits part in this process;   and the burden of defence expenditure should be brought more into line with that of our major european allies.   Planned British defence expenditure in 1974 was estimatedat 5.8 per cent of GNP on NATO definition, while that of france was 3.8 per cent, and of the Federal Republic of Germany 4.1 percent (or 4.9 per cent including Berlin Aid)*.* Defence expenditure as a percentage of GNP is not the only wayof comparing the burden of defence expenditure on the economy;but it is the best single readily-available measure of the defence effort In relation to a country&apos;s resources.    The table / oppoaite-/(fig. 1) gives a comparison of the defence efforts of NATO countriesin terms of percentage of GNP together with comparisons ofper capita defence expenditures and per capita GNPs.1-3
C0TOHMai.7.     At the same time the Government was determined that the processof adjustment should safeguard the essential security interests of britain and her Allies.    It was clear that only a fundamental andrigorous reappraisal of all britain&apos;s defence commitments and capabilities could provide the Government with the necessary information to enable it to strike the right balance between theneeds of the economy and the needs of defence.Conduct of the Review3.     The Review covered the whole of the forward period to 1983-8h*to make possible an orderly adjustment of our defence structure tomeet a different set of commitments and capabilities, and to allow for full military, financial, manpower, equipment and industrialplanning.9.     Clear strategic priorities were established at the outset;but no arbitrary financial limit was set, which would haveprejudiced the outcome of the analysis.    Instead, the military,political, economic and industrial implications of differentresource allocations were carefully considered.    Within NATO, the threat to the political and military security of Western   Europe,including the military imbalance between the Alliance and the warsaw pact (see figs. 2 and 3), was taken fully into account in assessing the possible effect of any reductions in Britain&apos;s contribution uponthe security of our Allies and upon the allied strategy ofdeterrence.    Similarly the political and military implications of reductions outside NATO were fully considered.10.   On 3 December 197h Parliament was informed of the Governmentsprovisional conclusions and proposals for future defence policy,programmes and expenditure, as a basis for full consultations with1-4CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
Parliament, with our Allies and partners and with industry beforedefinitive decisions were taken (House of Commons, Official ReportVoL 882, No, 30, Cols. 1351-1357).   The Government announced its decision to reduce defence expenditure progressively as a proportionof GNP to hi per cent over the next ten years.    Compared with theestimated costs of the previously planned programme, this will achieve substantial savings rising from  300 million in 1975-76 toabout  500 million a year by 1978-79 and to some  750 million ayear by 1983-84;    and a total saving of some  4,700 million overthe period (all at 1974 Survey prices).    This means that whereas in real terms there will be a small increase in 1975-76 and 1976-77,defence expenditure is planned to remain broadly at the same levelthereafter for the rest of the review period. / Paragraph 7^gives more details of the savings.    Within this programme a newbalance between commitments and capabilities and between manpower and equipment expenditure will be achieved to meet the Government&apos;sstrategic priorities.Consultations11.   As part of the process of consultation there have been debates in both Houses of Parliament in December 1974*; and much information and explanation has been provided in answer to a large number ofParliamentary Questions.   The Defence and External Affairs Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on Expenditure has taken writtenand oral evidence from the Ministry of Defence.    The views thusexpressed together with those made known to us by a wider public have been carefully considered by the Government in reaching its decisions.* In the House of Commons on 16 December(Official Report Vol.883?No. 39, Cols. 114-7-1262 and No. 40, Cols. 1263-1298) and in theHouse of Lords on 17 December (Official Report Vol. 555. No. 2^,Cols. 1042-1155).1-5CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
/CONFIDENTIAL12.   From early December detailed consultations have been conducted with our NATO Allies in accordance with the procedureslaid down by the Alliance on such matters.   After an extensivepolitical and military assessment of the Government1s proposalswithin NATO, the Alliance&apos;s views and suggestions have beenconveyed to us.   The Government has carefully considered the points made by our non-NATO Allies and partners in its consultations withthem since the 3 December announcement.13.   Our partners and associates outside NATO have noted our proposals with some regrets but have in general recognised theeconomic imperatives which led us to make them.   Detailed discus-sions on the best way of effecting the withdrawals and reductionsare in some cases still proceeding. Broadlyhowever the effect of the consultations has been to confirm theproposals announced on 3 December.14.   Our NATO Allies have expressed sympathetic understanding ofour economic difficulties.   They have welcomed our assurance that NATO commitments will remain the first charge on our defence-6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALresources, and that no reductions are envisaged in the CentralRegion in advance of an MBFR agreement, or in our nuclearcontribution to the Alliance.    Nevertheless they have expressedconsiderable disquiet at the overall scale of the reductionswe propose and the weakening effect which they would have onNATO&apos;s conventional capability vis-a-vis the Warsaw Pact,  ifnot offset by compensatory measures.   They have also expressed concern lest these measures should be interpreted as weakeningthe solidarity of the Alliance (particularly in the SouthernRegion) and its deterrent value.15.   While the main process of consultation with our Allies hasnow been completed, we shall continue to keep in close contact with our Allies as regards outstanding issues and the detailedimplementation of our plans, taking account of developments inthe economic, political and security situation as they arise.16.    Industry has been consulted where its interests are affectedby the proposals, and Its views have been taken into account inthe Governments decisions (see paragraph 71).     Ministry ofDefence civilian staffs are also being consulted (see paragraphs69 to 70).1-7
/THE GOVERNMENT&apos;S DECISIONS17.    The Government have now taken the basic decisions on theDefence Review which are outlined in the following paragraphs.To achieve the economic as well as the military and political objectives of the Review, Britain&apos;s defence forces had to be concentrated on those areas in which a British contribution tocollective defence would be most effective in ensuring Britain&apos;s security and that of her Allies.    This meant that NATO - the linchpin of British security - should remain the first and overridingcharge on the resources available for defence;    that our commitmentsoutside the Alliance should be reduced as far as possible to avoidoverstretching our forces;    and that general purpose forces shouldbe maintained as an insurance against the unforeseen.18.   The Governmenfs decisions are far-reaching and theirimplementation in terms of men, equipment and facilities will naturallytake time to work out in detail.    This work is being pressed aheadurgently.    The Government attaches great importance to giving theearliest possible information to those who may be affected, whether in the Services, in the Civil Service or in industry.CONTINUING COMMITMENT TO NATOin reaching its decisions the Government had to decide on the levelof defence and the balance of forces which Britain should maintain toensure security,-in the ourront era of detente between Eaot and Wc-oty1-8CONF! QSBNffilDEN T IAL
CONFIDENTIAL20.    in assessing the threat to Britain&apos;s security both militaryand political aspects must be considered.    In parallel with theirstated commitment to detente the Warsaw Pact countries maintainforces on the mainland of Europe which are increasing in strengthand capability and appear far larger than could be necessary fordefensive purposes.   They are composed, equipped and deployed in a manner which would enable them to undertake offensive operations at relatively short notice.   The Soviet Union has vastly expandedits Navy and can rapidly deploy substantial naval forces across the maritime lines of communication between Europe and North America.On the evidence of its national defence policies and its approach to international negotiations, the intention of the Soviet union is to achieve parity with the West in areas in which it has in thepast been inferior and to maintain superiority wherever it hasthis already.    Chapter II paragraphs 2-9 and figs.  2 and 3 give some details of the current imbalances of forces between NATOand the Warsaw Pact.   The Government does not believe that the warsaw Pact countries would contemplate outright aggression againstthe West in present circumstances; but this is a political judge-ment which neither alters the military facts nor necessarily holdsgood for ever.21.   Detente is not yet irreversible.    It is the stated policy of almost every Government, but it is still far from being permanent and comprehensive.    In common with its Allies, the Government is working to establish a safer, warmer and more constructive relation-ship with the Soviet Union and its Allies,   The recent visit tothe Soviet Union by the Prime Minister and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary has opened the way to progress in thisdirection.   But until detente is clearly established upon a lastingfoundation of mutual security, we should take a cautious view ofthe intentions of the Warsaw Pact.   These include the possibility&quot;that its members may try to use their massive military power,especially in conventional weapons, to bring political pressure to bear - perhaps selectively - on Western countries in the hopeof influencing their external and even their domestic policies.1-confidential
22.    Such an attempt could succeed only if Western countries wereto lose confidence in their ability to sustain their own institutions in the present world economic climate these institutions will come under increasing stress in the next few years.    It is essentialduring this period, in order to deter any more adventurist policyand to sustain the momentum of detente, that the political cohesionof the Alliance should be maintained, as well as an effectivemilitary strategy.23.   Adequate defence calls for military forces capable of denyingany potential aggressor the prospect of an easy victory.    It calls for a military capability of conventional forces manifestly capableof withstanding any initial attack and        backed by tactical and strategic nuclear forces, which in Europe and the Atlantic only the nato   Alliance can provide.    So long as the Alliance has such acapability, and the will to use it if necessary, aggression of whatever sort can be deterred, and the use of military power as apolitical weapon neutralised.j2h.   The Government is fully committed to preserving the credibilityof NATO&apos;8 strategy and political cohesion.    It is determined tomaintain an effective British contribution to the Alliance&apos;forces.     But some reduction in our current NATO contribution is inevitable if the strain on the British economy is to be eased by bringing the burden of British defence expenditure more into line with that borne by our major European Allies.1-10CONFIDENTIAL
The areas where Britain, can best contribute25-   The Government has decided to concentrate British effort in those areas where it believes that Britain can make the most significant contribution to her security and that of the Alliance.The Government judges these to be:-a.     The Central Region,    where NATO is heavily and increasingly outnumbered in fighting divisions, in manpower in fighting units and in all the major weapons systems (tanks,field guns and aircraft)(see figure 2). The British Army of the rhine(BAOR) , which holds an important section of the Central front in the crucial area -of the North ^German plain, and RAF Germanyplay a major part in the forward defence of this Region.For these reasons, we will continue to maintain an army forcelevel of 55,000 and a tactical air force on the mainland ofEurope in accordance with our Brussels Treaty commitments,making no reductions below this level . :in advance of -mutual and balanced force reductions (MBFR).V/e shall continue to        provide        for reinforcing these forces in times of tension or emergency.    They will be progressively re-equipped to improve their effectiveness.Scorpion tracked reconnaissance vehicles have already enteredservice with the Army; in due course the Lance tactical nuclearmissile system will replace Honest John; and the Rapier low-level surface-to-air missile system has entered service withthe Army, and with the RAF Regiment for airfield defence.Plans for the introduction of the Multi-Role Combat Aircraft1-11CONFIDENTIAL
(MRCA) into RAF Germany will continue,and Phantoms will hereplaced with increased numbers of Jaguars.b.      The Eastern Atlantic and Channel Areas.    NATO&apos;s strategyof deterrence on the mainland of Europe would not remaincredible without a parallel strategy in the Eastern atlantic and Channel areas, upon which our maritime force   declarationswill in future be concentrated.    These are the forward seaareas of NATO, corresponding to the Central Region on land,in which NATO&apos;s maritime forces face the growing power ofthe Soviet Navy.(see figure 3).All the sea-borne supply and reinforcement routes from north America to Britain and the European mainland pass through these areas.    If the balance of maritime power were allowed to shift so far in favour of the Warsaw Pact that ithad an evident ability in a -period of tension to isolateEurope by sea, the effect on Allied confidence and politicalcohesion would be profound.NATO depends critically on Britain to provide the mainweight of the maritime forces immediately available to the alliance in these areas; it is for this reason that theGovernment plans to maintain its contribution to their defencevirtually undiminished.    Therefore the cruiser and nuclear-powered submarine programmes will be maintained and the newclasses of destroyers and frigates will continue to build up.c     The security of the United Kingdom and its immediateapproaches, at sea, on land and in the air.    Without this no contribution to the security of our Allies and no reinforcement of our forward-based forces would be possible..    1-12CONFIDENTIAL   -CONFIDENTIAL
d.     The NATO nuclear deterrent.   NATO strategy is founded on the triad of conventional, tactical nuclear and strategic nuclear weapons.   The Polaris force, which Britain willcontinue to make available to the Alliance, provides aunique European contribution to NATO*s strategic nuclearcapability out of all proportion to the small fraction ofour defence budget which it costs to maintain.   We shall .maintain its effectiveness.   We do not intend to move to anew generation of strategic nuclear weapons.   We shall alsomaintain our tactical nuclear capability, in accordance withNATO strategy.In addition we shall continue to maintain some specialist rein-forcement capability     (see paragraphs   26   to   27   below).Specialist Reinforcement forces26.   There will be no reduction in the present British contribution of a battalion group, support units, twelve Harrier-aircraft andfpur Wessex helicopters to the.Allied Command Europe.(ACE)Mobile Force.This contribution will continue to be available to SACEUR fordeployment throughout his area of command.   But we will makesignificant changes to our contributions of other specialistreinforcement forces.27.   Our specialist reinforcement forces were originally designedto meet our former world-wide commitments, as an alternative to overseas garrisons, but were committed to NATO in 1968.    The landelements of the United Kingdom Mobile Force (UKMF) and United KingdomJoint Airborne Task Force (UKJATFOR) have never been   fully equipped for highly-mobile armoured operations in a NATO environment; andthe specialised amphibious shipping could only be replaced at-13CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
considerable expense.    In assessing our present wide-rangingcontributions to NATO, we decided that our ability to reinforceon the southern flank was less cost-effective than in other areas.Consequently we have decided to make substantial changes in our commitments of specialist reinforcement forces as follows:-a.     The Amphibious Force.   At present our amphibiouscapability consists of a Royal Marines brigade headquarters,four commando groups, a logistic regiment and Army support units,two squadrons of Royal Navy support helicopters, two commandoships (HMS Hermes and HMS Bulwark), two assault ships,(HMS Fearless and HMS Intrepid), and afloat support.HMS Bulwark will be paid off in 1976, e(arlier than previously-planned, and her Wessex helicopter squadron will be disbanded.HMS Hermes will be declared to NATO as an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carrier but will retain a secondary role as acommando ship.    HMS Fearless and HMS Intrepid will remain in service as previously planned throughout the 1980s, but onlyone ship will be kept at immediate operational readiness, thesecond being in care and maintenance or refit.    Plans to ordertwo purpose-built amphibious ships have been abandoned and detailed studies of alternative means of movement in the longer term are in hand.No. 41 Commando Group, at present stationed in Malta, willbe gradually run down from 1977 to 1979 when it will be disbandupon the withdrawal of British forces from Malta.    The royal marines brigade headquarters, three commandos and Army supportwill remain declared to NATO.    One of these commando groups andthe helicopter squadron will continue to be specially trained and equipped for mountain and arctic warfare for deployment to northern Norway all the year round.1-14
b. The UK Joint Airborne Task Force.   This task force,currently consistmg.&apos; odf a headquarters, a parachute force(including two battalions and their support), andHercules air transport, is to be abandoned, butthe Parachute Regiment will be retained.c. The United Kingdom Mobile Force. At present this force consists of a land element of three air-portable brigades with divisional troops and logistic support;   and an air element of three squadrons ofPhantom   offensive and reconnaissance aircraft(which are being replaced by Jaguars), one squadron ofAndover short-range transports and three squadrons of support helicopters.   This is to be reduced by 1979to an airportable formation equivalentto   a     reinforced brigade group,   but witha limited parachute capability,   an improved levelof support, and the same air element, less the Andovers.   This smaller force will beprovided   for deployment to the Central and NorthernRegions of NATO.   The residual land elements of theforces will be disbanded or re-absorbed within the newArmy structure described in paragraphs 4-7 to 53 below.These plans are set out in more detail in the table/opposite7(fig. 4-).1-15CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
NATO commitments in the Mediterranean28.   The Government has decided that it cannot in future continue to commit British maritime forces to the Mediterranean in support of nato.   After 1976 no destroyers, frigates or coastal minesweepers willbe earmarked for assignment to NATO in the area; and that &quot;between1977 and 1979 the RAF Nimrods and Cariberras at present committed to NATO there will be withdrawn.   In peace time HM Ships will howevervisit the Mediterranean from time to time and will contine to part-icipate in exercises there with our NATO Allies.29.   The Government of Malta has been informed that HMG proposes toarrange for the run-down of the British forces in Malta between1 April 1977 and 31 March 1979, when the Military FacilitiesAgreement expires.Government reactions to NATO18 suggestions30.   During our consultations with our NATO Allies (see paragraphs12-15 above) they have asked us to reconsider those features of the reductions which they consider most damaging and to study thepossibility of undertaking compensatory measures. We have undertaken to study such measures on the clear understanding that all of Britain&apos;defence commitments and capabilities must be met from within thetotal of resources which the Government decided last December itcould in future allocate to defence.31.   On this basis the Government is ready to make the followingchanges in the details of its original proposals, to help meet themain points of NATO concern:-(a) to convert HMS Hermes to the anti-submarine role in 1976,instead of 1978;(b) to earmark for assignment to Commander in Chief Channel(CINCHAN) the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Engadine. carryinghelicopters in the anti-submarine role;1-16
(c) to earmark some additional aircraft to Supreme allied commander Atlantic (SACLANT)/cINCHAN for reconnaissance:(d) as part of national deployments to participate inperiodic NATO maritime exercises and in the NATO NavalOn-Call Force in the Mediterranean;(e) to continue reinforcement options for the SpecialAir Service Regiment in the Southern Region of allied command Europe.32. The Government is prepared on the same - understanding^ and without commitment, to study nationally and within the Alliance other measuresaimed at-mitigating the effects of our reductions.   Our ability to imple-ment the measures which our-Allies wish us to adopt will depend particularly on their willingness to give us assistance, eg with &quot;host nation&quot;facilities for ships, men and aircraft.   Decisions on these further measures will be announced, where appropriate, as they are taken.NON-NATO COMMITMENTS33.   At the beginning of 1975 Britain still maintained forces invarious parts of the world (see Annex C   for a map showing the deployment of UK forces in early 1975).   Some of these deploymentsreflect inescapable obligations, notably to the security of ourdependent territories; others reflect former aspirations to a world-widerole.   They absorbed a comparatively small;proportion of the defence budget:withdrawal from all of them, including the garrisons in theMediterranean, would save  150 million a year at most.   But this represented a significant sum in terms of the savings which would otherwise have had to be found exclusively from our higher priorityNATO tasks.    Consequently, we proposed to withdraw from our non-NATO1-17;C0HfE5JlfltESgMLCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcommitments wherever this was consistent with our fundamentalmilitary and political obligations.    Following the Statement on December 1974 we have consulted the governments concerned, andhave taken our decisions in the light of those consultations.34.   We shall continue to maintain forces in the dependent territories of Hong Kong, Gibraltar, Belize and the Falkland Islands.In Hong Kong there will be some reductions in British Servicemen andlocally-enlisted personnel; and we are seeking from the Hong KongGovernment a larger share of the cost of our forces when thepresent cost-sharing agreement, which expires in 1976, is re-negotiated.35.    The Five Power Defence Arrangements include a consultativecommitment, but no obligation to maintain British troops in eitherMalaysia or Singapore.   We shall maintain the commitment; but,with the exception of a small residual contribution to the IntegratedAir Defence System, we will withdraw our forces, including thedetachment of up to four Nimrods from the British maritime patrolforce, by April 1976.36.    We will continue our membership of the South East Asia treaty organisation (SEATO), but will take part in fewer exercises in thefuture.    V/e do - not declare forces to the Organisation.37.    Subject to consultations with the Sultan, we propose to carryout our 1968 decision to withdraw the Gurkha battalion from Brunei.38.    V/e shall withdraw from the staging post on Gan by April 1976;and from the naval communications station on Mauritius.    If thereis any requirement for facilities in the Indian Ocean area in thefuture, we shall be able to use Diego Garcia, where we have agreedto a modest expansion of facilities by the United States.   We shall-18CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL

Any such arrangements would clearly requirethe participation of the US and Soviet Governments; so we supportthe suggestion made by the Prime Minister of Australia that theUS and Soviet Governments should consult together on the possibilityof mutual restraint in the Indian Ocean.39&apos;   Oman is fighting against a professionally organised andexternally supported rebellion which threatens the stability of the arabian Peninsula, an area of great economic importance to Britainand from which v/e receive a lot of our oil. We do not therefore thinkthat it would be right in present circumstances to make any changein the arrangements we have with the Sultan of Oman.   We shall,however, make some economies as our need for staging facilities atMasirah declines, and shall continue to keep the level of our military assistance to the Sultan under review.4-0&apos;    In Cyprus we propose to make some early reduction in our forces.stationed there.

EFFECTS OF THE DECISIONS ON THE SERVICESRoyal Navy4-5,   From 1976 onwards all our major warships will he committed to NATO in the Eastern Atlantic and Channel, although we will continuefrom time to time to deploy ships in peace-time outside these areas.We will no longer commit ships to NATO in the Mediterranean area, and we will withdraw our naval forces hitherto stationed there and in singapore and the West Indies0   The effect of these measures will he progres-sive reductions of one-seventh in planned numbers of destroyers,frigates and mine countermeasure   vessels (MCMVs).    There will beconsequential reductions in afloat support.   We shall be specialis-ing increasingly in nuclear-powered submarines, while other Europeannavies, such as the Royal Netherlands Navy, specialise inconventionally-powered submarines. Consequently we will reduce plannednumbers of conventionally-powered submarines by about one quarter,while continuing our nuclear-powered submarine programme.   The newclass of anti-submarine cruisers will be continued, but we willabandon our plans to replace the amphibious ships with new, purpose-built vessels.    Plans to replace the Wessex 5 helicopter have alsobeen abandoned.   HMS Ark Royal will continue in service until thelate 1970b as previously planned.46.   The reductions in the numbers of destroyers and frigates,which are accounted for by the cut in our overseas and Mediterranean1-21amCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcommitments, will be achieved partly by the premature disposalof older ships and partly by the adjustment of new constructionprogrammes.   Over the Review period nine new destroyers/frigateswill be cut from the forward programme, including planned orders in 1975-76 for two Type A-2 destroyers.   There will be a corresponding reduction in the future requirement for Lynx helicopters.   ships already under construction will not be affected by these proposals.Reductions in MCMVs (also related to our Mediterranean commitments)and in conventional submarines will be achieved by the prematuredisposal of existing ships.   Because of the magnitude of the miningthreat to UK waters, longer term plans for a smaller number ofmore advanced new MCMVs remain unchanged.   Reductions in afloat supportwill be made by phasing out older ships and by deleting from the forwardprogramme one Fleet maintenance ship, three large Fleet tankers and one afloatsupport ship.   The reductions in strength of the Royal Navy and theRoyal Marines will lead in due course to economies in shore support and training.   Ve aim to secure savings as quickly as is consistent with the needs of the Fleet.The Army47.   The Statement of 3 December said that the size and shape of theArmy would be adjusted to meet the new framework of defence priori-ties and the demands of economy.   In order to achieve the objectives in a manpower-intensive Service, it was decided that a major restructuring of the Army would have to be undertaken.   Themain aim of this restructuring will be to maintain as far as possiblethe present combat capability of the Army in Europe and in theUnited Kingdom, while reducing the overall number of men.   Planning is1-22CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALalready well advanced.48.   The principles upon which the restructuring has been basedare :-a. Elimination of a level of command and extensionof the span of command at formation and unit level;b. Economy through pooling certain specialistfunctions, for example the concentration in specialistunits of transport vehicles;c. Improvement in the        man-to-weapon ratio;d. Closer integration of the Territorial and ArmyVolunteer Reserve (TAVR) with the Regular Army.49.   All Arms and Corps of the Army will bear some share of thereduction in manpower.   Many headquarters are to be disbanded with consequent economies in overheads.   The strength of fighting Annsis to be adjusted to achieve an overall net saving; but, in line with the principles of the restructuring, proportionally greatersavings will be achieved in the supporting services.50.   The effect of this restructuring will be to maintain fully and in some respects enhance the fighting capability of theBritish Army of the Rhine, and to improve our ability to reinforceit and put it on a war footing.     We willprune some rear headquarters and support areas.   The brigade level- - -of command will be eliminated with a consequent reduction in head-quarter overheads.   Units will be commanded directly by smaller-sized divisional headquarters.   The span of command will be increased at both the formation and unit level, with the result that there will befewer formation headquarters overall, and fewer but larger units. UnitI -23
structures will be simplified by concentrating specialist functions,such as reconnaissance, into one arm;   but the manning of front lineequipments will not be impaired.   Notwithstanding these changes we will not, in advance of mutual and balanced force reductions, reducethe forces which we maintain in Germany in accordance with our brussels treaty obligations.   The Berlin Brigade will be harmonised with theproposed new organisation.51.   In the United Kingdom, the present Headquarters United KingdomLand Force (HQUKLF) and District structure will be maintained virtuallyas at present, but economies will be made by extending the span of command to give selected District headquarters the responsibility atpresent exercised by the field force formation headquarters in theUnited Kingdom.   These District headquarters will therefore also becomeformation, headquarters.   The TAVR is to be maintained at its presentsize and is to be more closely integrated with/the Regular Army by in-cluding TAVR units alongside Regular units as part of the newDistrict organisation.   Our plans allow for a small proportionate increase in the number of TAVR units earmarked for reinforcement ofBAOR.   Manpower economies are also being sought in Ministry of Defenceheadquarters, and in the United Kingdom training organisation andlogistic base.52.  The proposals will enable us to retain all existing regimentalidentities in both the Royal Armoured Corps and in the Infantry;   toman broadly the same major equipments within the Royal Artillery, but with some reductions in the total number of regiments in line with thenew policy of maintaining larger regiments with more guns;   andsimilarly to reduce regiments of other Arms and Corps, such as the corps of Royal Engineers, without significant loss of operationalcapability.53. These changes in structure will enable better use to be madeof manpower throughout the Army and will make possible a1-24CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
significant improvement in the        man -to-weapon ratio.   Theyare expected to produce an overall reduction in numbers which willbe nearer 15,000 than the initial estimate of 12,000, and whichwill include some measure of redundancy.54,   The Army equipment programme is made up of a variety of comparatively low-priced items.   The scope for savings throughcancellation or postponement of major new equipments or weaponsystems is therefore limited, compared with the other two Services;and the substantial reduction which must be made in the programme will     affect      a wide range of items.   Savings will be effected by a mixture of reductions in numbers, postponements and cancel-lations.   The field will cover such items as ammunition and mines,bridging equipment, fighting and   transport      vehicles, guided weapons and electronics.   Pour major measures, which were announced in the Statement of 3 December 1974-, are:-a. withdrawal from the RS 80 long range artilleryproject (currently at project definition stage) onwhich we were collaborating with Italy and West Germany;b. cancellation of the Vixen wheeled reconnaissancevehicle;c. reductions in the planned purchases of Anglo-French light helicopters;d. reductions in the follow-up orders for Sultan,Spartan   and Samaritan, all members of the Anglo-Belgian Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked)(CVR(T)) family of reconnaissance vehicles.1-25CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALDespite these reductions     every effort will be made to implement the planned improvements promised to NATO in the fields of anti-armour and air defence.   Provision will continue to be made for major items which are essential for a modern field army inEurope.Royal Air Force55,   We shall maintain the planned numbers of our front-line combat aircraft committed to NATO in Britain and West Germany.   But the reductions in our specialised reinforcement tasks and our with-withdrawals from the Mediterranean and from most of our non-NATOcommitments will enable us to make a substantial reduction in theRAF transport fleet and some reduction in the requirement formaritime patrol aircraft.56.   RAF combat capability will be improved by the replacement ofPhantoms in the strike attack and reconnaissance roles by increasednumbers of Jaguars, which will allow the Phantoms to be transferredto the air defence role;   and in due course by the introductionof the   MRCA. Our planned requirement for a total of 385KRCAs is unaffected, but in order to spread the costs of theprogramme in later years we propose to reduce the rate of deliveries to the   Royal Air Force by up to one-third.   We shall be working outthe exact details with our collaborative partners.57.   By early 1976 we intend to reduce the fixed-wing element ofthe RAF transport fleet by 50 per cent, from 115 to 57 aircraft.The Comet and Britannia squadrons and the Andover tactical trans-port force will be disbanded - a total of 39 aircraft;   and the1-26CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnumber of VC10 and Hercules aircraft in operation will be reduced from 66 to 1+7;    the Belfast Squadron of ten aircraft is not affected. The size of the planned RAF helicopter tacticaltransport force will be reduced by about one quarter by cutting thenumber of Whirlwinds in Cyprus and disbanding the Wessex squadron in singapore;   and by abandoning current plans for a new purchaseof medium-lift helicopters for support of the Army from 1977*The Nimrod maritime patrol force will be reduced by a quarter.58,   The withdrawal from most of our non-NATO commitments willenable us to reduce the task and size of the RAF Regiment.   Weare therefore examining the structure of the Regiment to determinehow its remaining tasks can best be met.   We foresee no changes inits responsibilities   for      operating      the Rapier low level air defence system.59.   The reduction in the size of the RAF transport force andeconomies in training, communication and general support aircraft willenable the Royal Air Force to concentrate some smaller units at majorstations with good facilities, such as Brize Norton and Lyneham;and to withdraw from some twelve stations or airfields during theperiod covered by the Defence Review.   The stations which the Royal Air Forcepropose to vacate are Leconfield, Driffield, Bicester, Chessington,Colerae, Thorney Island, West Raynham, Little Rissington, Tern Hill,Hullavington, Medmenham and Biggin Hill, though they may need toretain enclaves at Leconfield and West Raynham.    The process of1-27CONFIDENTIAL
informing those concerned and the subsequent discussion of theseredeployment proposals is being initiated with their publication in this Command paper.60.   A number of these stations have accommodation or other facilities which might be put to good u3e by the other two services and enable significant savings to be made in our needs for new buildings.   The Army in particular has an urgent need toreplace its considerable stock of hutted accommodation by more permanent buildings.   To make the best use of defence lands and buildings the Army are examining each of these stations toestablish how suitable they are for the Army&apos;s use.   Preciseassessments of the Army&apos;s needs can be made only after detailedstudies have been conducted of the Army&apos;s long-term accommodationneeds and deployments in Britain, access to training and supportfacilities and the costs of conversion.   The Royal Navy may also needone or two stations.   Any redeployments are bound to be phasedover a period, so it is likely that some civilian staffreductions will be unavoidable.1-28CONFIDENTIAL
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION61.   Before the Defence Review the annual equipment budget was planned   to rise from about  1.300 million in 1972+-75 to about  2,000 million in the early 1980s.    The latter figure will now be limited to about  1,500 million and a totalsaving of some  3,200 million on the planned equipment budget willbe achieved over the next ten years,(at 197U Survey prices).62.  Expenditure on the Research and Development element of this,together with manpower and other associated costs was planned to rise from  2+1+0 million in 197U-75 to  510 million in 1978-79 and to fall away to  2+50 million in 1983-82+.    It will now be limited to  2+70 million in 1978-79 and  2+00 million in1983-8I+ - a saving of about 10 per cent.    At a conservative estimate the total saving on the R&amp;D programme over the ten-year period is now expected to be some  2+2+0 million.    Most of these savingswill come from the development programme which accounts for somethreequarters of the R&amp;D budget.    But significant savings willbe made on research , equipment, capital facilities and manpower in R &amp; D Establishments.Collaboration63.   The United Kingdom is already engaged on a number of collabora-tive defence projects.    The Defence Review decisions will involvewithdrawal from only one of these - the RS 80 artillery project (see paraRevere restrictions on the resources available for defence willmake collaboration even more important in the future, not only for1-29 *confidential confidential
confidential the financial advantages to be gained but also for the military-benefits to be derived from standardised equipment which shouldfacilitate common logistics,  training and operations.   (see chapter II paragraphs 13 to 16   for further details on collaboration.)MANPOWER IMPLICATIONS64.   In broad   terms   manpower   reductions   willbe   of   the   order   of   38sOOO   or    11   percent for the Armed services and 30,000 or 10 per cent for civiliansupport.   These assessments have been made against actual strengthsat 1 April 1974 and cover the reductions expected over the five-year period to 1 April 1979.    By this time the new manpower levelsresulting from the Defence Review will have been broadly achieved.Tt is difficult to provide detailed estimates at this stage   ofwhen or where these reductions will falL but the figures below givea broad indication of the overall effect:-Royal Navy/Royal MarinesArmyRoyal AirForceUK-basedciviliansL oc a1ly-ent eredcivilians(MOD and DOE)Strengths1.4.7479,000180,000(including7,000Gurkhas)100,000249,00060,000Reductionsby 1.4.793,00015,000(including,0C0Gurkhas)18,00015,00015,000Strengthsat 1.4.7974,000165,000(including6,000Gurkhas)82,000234,00045,000PercentageReductions6 per cent8 per cent18 per cent6 per cent25 per cent-30CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL65,   The     reductions will bear most heavily,  in proportional terms,on the Royal Air Force and on locally-entered civilians.    This isa direct result of our decision to withdraw from many of our non-ttaTO commitments and the consequent reduction in theRAF     transport fleet.    Elsewhere it is not possible to equateparticular withdrawals with reductions, since the forcesconcerned will in most cases be redeployed to other tasks.   Futuremanpower needs have been calculated against the commitments to bemet tinder our revised defence policy and the new force structures-required to discharge them.Service Personnel66.   Wherever possible the necessary manpower reductions will beachieved by normal wastage and by adjustment of recruiting.But some redundancies will be unavoidable in certain sectors of theServices where age, rank and trade structures have to be maintained. Theterms of compensation for British   8ervice personnel made redundant are essentially an updating of those which applied to the redundancyprogramme announced in 1967 (Cmnd. 3357) and implemented since;they are outlined in Annex .H&apos;.67.   The need for redundancies, and the timing of them, will vary from Service to Service, as follows :-a.Royal Navy and Royal Marines; Because of existing manpowershortages,  the incidence of redundancy will be very small,probably less than 1000 United Kingdom Service personnel between1976 and 1979.        At least six months&apos; notice will be given tothose concerned. Redundancy among locally-enlisted uniformedpersonnel, though kept to a minimum, will be proportionallygreater. &apos;-b. Army;   Restructuring will affect nearly all headquarters:&apos;:&apos;.vand units, and    trials   and1-31CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
detailed studies have still to be conducted. Redundancy has there fore been only provisionally assessed.    In the region of 6,000 all ranks are likely to be involved, of which abouta quarter are expected to be officers. Officers mainlyaffected will be those aged between hO and 50 in 1980, but some in the 30 to UO age bracket may be included. Soldierredundancy will affect mainly Warrant Officers and NCOs with more than to years service.   All those declared redundantwill receive a minimum of six months&apos; notice, and thoseselected for compulsory redundancy will retain their normalright of appeal,   An announcement giving full details of thefirst phase of the programme will be made in December 1975,and the first officers and soldiers will leave in October 1976.c.     Royal Air Force:   The number being made redundant in theRoyal Air Force will be approximately h,000 and this will include 800 officers. In order to maintain a balanced service with good career potential, the programme, which will cover a period of two years, will be largely compulsory though there will be a voluntary element in it. At least six months&apos;notice will be given to those leaving the Service as a resultof redundancy and there will be provision for appeal againstcompulsory selection. Full details of those selected for thefirst phase of redundancy will be announced during the  ummerand the main outflow of officers and airmen will begin towardsthe end of the year. It may be that some will wish to leaveearlier and this should be possible in certain cases.Ml facilities for resettlement advice and assistance will beprovided for those returning prematurely to civilian life.CO00*  Notwithstanding these reductions and redundancies, we shallI- 32
CONFIDENTIALcontinue to need men and women of the highest calibre to meetthe challenging task which the Armed Forces will be  called upon to perform.   We shall not therefore relax our recruiting effort   andwill continue to provide full and worthwhile careers for all thosewho enter.nivillan employees in the United Kingdom69.   . We     estimate   that the number of civilians employed insupport of the forces in the United Kingdom will eventually bereduced by about 15,000, largely by normal wastage.   Where redundancyis unavoidable, for example because of the complete closure of an establishment, the employees affected will be -eligible for payments under the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme.    These are ingeneral more favourable than those prescribed under the redundancy payments Act.    As much notice as possible will be given to employees and to their Trades Union and Staff Associations and there will be full consultation as plans become more advanced.Locally-entered civilians abroad70.    Some 15,000 locally-entered civilians employed in support ofthe Services abroad will be affected by the withdrawal from overseasbases.   Their discharge will be phased in accordance with rundownplans to be determined by the local Service authorities.    Individualemployees will be given as much notice as possible of theirdischarge. They will be paid the terminal benefits and redundancycompensation provided for in their conditions of service.&quot;ORGANISATION OF THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE71.       A management review of the objectives and structure of the Ministryof Defence will be carried out in conjunction with the Civil service department.    This is one of a series of management reviews of majorGovernment Departments, but the specific purpose in this case is to adjust the size and shape of the Ministry of Defence following the Defence Review. &quot;
CONFIDENT IALINDUSTRIAL AND EMPLOYMENT IMPLICATIONSAt present we estimate that the numbers employed in thedefence industries on contracts placed by the Ministry of Defence wbe reduced by about 10,000, or about h per cent of the total,  overa five-year period.    This is a broad estimate which takes accountof expected improvements in productivity as well as the futurecontent of the equipment programme.    It will be some time beforethe adjustments to our equipment proposals are fully reflected inthe workload of firms or factories.    The reduction will fallunevenly, affecting some firms and localities more severely than others.    Among the main firms are Westlands&apos;at Yeovil and the SmallEngine Division of Rolls Royce at Watford, both of which will beaffected by the cuts in requirements for helicopters.    A reductionin the planned rate of delivery of the MRCA for the Royal Air force will affect the production of British Aircraft Corporation inLancashire, and of Rolls Royce at Bristol and Coventry which is&apos;&apos;&apos; 1 -?-) -A-y f i     iff&apos;.1&apos;       &apos;: - V &apos; &apos;.&apos; &apos; &apos;&apos;responsible for the RB199 engine.    Reductions in the numbers ofin-service   aircraft will affect Hawker Siddeley Aviation at manchester and Bitteswell and Rolls Royce at East Kilbride andCoventry.    The conventional armaments industry is not likely to suffer much change in employment.    The shipbuilding industryhowever, will be given less work.    The exact implications for eachfirm cannot be assessed until forward equipment programmes havebeen revised in detail.    However,  the main firms likely to beaffected have been notified of the probable consequences so thatthe;/ can study the implications, and consult their employees.1-34CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThere has also heen consultation with the defence industries throuithe National Defence Industries Council.Royal Ordnance Factories73 J^l   Until the future equipment programmes for the three services have been worked out in more detail it will not be possible to assess the effects on the future workload of the Royal OrdnanceFactories.    But it is hoped that the overall level of employment will not be seriously affected.    These factories carry out asubstantial amount of defence sales work for export, and scopemay exist for them to undertake more commercial work should this be necessary.The Royal Dockyardslo-Sf^   It is intended to maintain the capacity of the Royal Dockyardat about the present level.   Warship repairs and refits willcontinue to be their main task.    This load will not be greatly reduced. .Although there will be some reduction in work on surface,ships and conventionally-powered submarines, an increasing-proportion of dockyard capacity will be taken up by the growingnumbers of nuclear-powered submarines.    Some spare capacity isexpected to arise, mainly from 1977-78 onwards; it is not possibleto predict how it will be filled, but the emphasis will be onabsorbing naval work which would otherwise have been placed to contract,  for example refits of Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels.Suitable additional repayment work will also be undertaken.    Inrilling spare capacity full regard will be paid to the possible effects on employment elsewhere.1-35CONFIDENT-IAL
CONFIDENTIALNEW PATTERNS OF DEFENCE EXPENDITUREizyW.   As a result of the Defence Review the cost of the planneddefence programme over the period to 1983-84 has been reduced froman average of  4,300 million a year to an average of less than 3,800 million a year.   As compared with the forecast of expenditurecompleted early last year it is as follows:-( m at 1974 Survey Prices)annual average1978-9    1979-80 - 1983-44,300 4,4503,800 3,790Difference        300 270 350 500 660The figures for the last five years are necessarily approximateat this stage.   The total savings over the review period, estimatedat over  4,700 million     including a reduction of  750 million in the final year,    represent a 12 per cent reduction fromthe previous programme.77On the assumption that GNP grows at an average rate of about 3 percent a year over the period as a whole the effect of the defence review decisions would be to reduce the share of resources absorbed by defence from  the estimated 197U-75 level of about 5? per cent of GNP to hi- per cent of GNP over the next ten years.In terms of major resources - manpower,  equipment and &quot;other&quot;(buildings and miscellaneous stores and services)1-36CONFIDENTIALPreviousProgrammeDefenceReview1975-64,0003,7001976-7 44,0703,8001977-84,1503,800

Significantsavings in Army equipment have been offset by a positive decisionto keep Army manpower and combat capability at the level necessaryto enable it to carry out its primary tasks.

Progress in pursuit of detente, if it is notto be illusory, must be based on a strong and united NATOAlliance, across the Atlantic and within Europe, and on genuineattempts to negotiate measures of arms limitation and control to provide a more stable relationship in Europe and undiminishedsecurity for both East and Vest.    Such attempts must take full account of the military situation described below.THE MILITARY BALANCE2.     The Soviet Union has achieved rough strategic nuclear paritywith the United States (recently re-affirmed by the StrategicArms Limitation agreement in principle at Vladivostok, referredto in paragraph 32 below)     and is developing an improved armouryof strategic nuclear weapons designed at least to maintain it.New delivery systems include four new types of IntercontinentalBallistic Missiles (ICBMs), some of which are being developed tocarry Multiple Independently-targetable Re-entry Vehicles (MIRVs);and further work is proceeding on the hardening of ICBM silos.Delta class submarines, equipped with new submarine-launchedballistic missiles (SLBMs) with a range of over 4,000 miles,greatly increase   the geographical area from which a strategic nuclear threat against NATO can be mounted.II-confidential
confidential.      In addition, the Warsaw Pact faces the Alliance with amarked superiority in manpower and conventional weapons.    in central Europe the disparities are over 2? to 1 in tanks,  over2 to 1  in divisions and in aircraft,  and about 2 to 1  in field guns. The Warsaw Pact has about 20 per cent more soldiersand some 30 to L0 per cent more in fighting unite.    On        NATO&apos;snorthern flank   the disparities are even greater.h.     The disparities quoted for Central Europe do not take accountof forces stationed in the Soviet Union itself.    In a time of tension Warsaw Pact forces in Poland, czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic could be rapidly reinforced by substantial air and ground formations currently held in thewestern USSR; and the present imbalance of forces in central europe would be increased.5.     Nor can numerical comparisons alone give a wholly adequatepicture.    The Warsaw Pact has geographical advantages and in themain has standardised equipment.    It is making rapid progress inmodernising and re-equipping its forces and in reducing suchadvantages in quality as NATO still possesses.    Over the last fiveyears the Poviet Union has improved and increased the capability ofits forces to a much greater extent than in any previous five-yearII-2CONFIDENT I AT,
period in peacetime   and these improvements have in somecases been reflected in the forces of other Warsaw Pact countries.Soviet tank and motor rifle divisions in Eastern Germany have increa-sed in manpower strength by about 15 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. Motor rifle divisions now have some 50 per cent more tanks.than before 1970. Notable recent additions in equipment include a moderninfantry combat vehicle, several low   to medium-altitude surface-to-air missiles systems   and excellent new artillery and engineerequipments.   Tactical nuclear missile delivery systems haveincreased in numbers and improved in mobility.6.    The Soviet Union has also emerged as a maritime super power. Ithas developed a large, modern, well-equipped fleet of cruisers,destroyers and escorts, over 1,000 naval aircraft and some 320operational submarines of which over 120 are nuclear-powered.   two aircrafts carriers are under construction.   The Warsaw Pact&apos;sbuilding rate for nuclear-powered submarines is now twice that of nato.   The numbers of Warsaw Pact and NATO surface ships are  broadly   similar, but     Allied surface vessels include a verymuch higher proportion of older ships and carry substantially feweroffensive or defensive missile systems.   Furthermore, such numericalcomparisons disguise the full extent of the imbalance between theSoviet submarine fleet,which is now increasingly nuclear-powered,and the capability of not&apos;s anti-submarine forces.The Soviet threat at sea therefore comes more from the.    very large submarine force and from theSoviet Union&apos;s substantial building programme which is improving the quality and average age of the Soviet fleet compared with thoseof the Alliance.   The maritime balance has shifted, and isII-confidential
continuing to shift, markedly in favour of the Warsaw Pact.    Inthe Eastern Atlantic Area, NATO&apos;s mainly British maritime forcesat immediate readiness for forward defence are already outnumbered.The Soviet Navy has expanded out of all proportion to Soviet seabornetrade.7.     Warsaw Pact air forces and missile systems have also been improved over the last five years, in particular with theintroduction of large numbers of technologically-advancedmulti-role aircraft.The MIG 25 FOXBAT all-weatherinterceptor and reconnaissance aircraft for instance is capable ofMach 3 at altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet.1   This aircraft and   the new MIG 23 FLOGGER ground attack fighter are already deployedon airfields in East Germany, while the introduction is imminent of the newFENCER multi-role aircraft and the BACKFIRE medium bomber, bothof which are supersonic. The Soviet Air Force is continuallyimproving its ability to penetrate Western defences through the extensive use of electronic warfare to jam radars and communications.The Soviet Air Forces in Europe are less vulnerable than those of NATObecause they are dispersed over more airfields and across a wider area.Their vulnerability on the ground has been further reduced by theconstruction of large numbers of aircraft shelters.8.     Soviet expenditure on defence for 1975 is officially statedto be 17,430 million roubles, which is a reduction on the compara-ble figure for 1974.        This is difficult to reconcile with thefacts described above.    In fact, substantial additional expenditure for defence purposes,  in particular for military research anddevelopment, is carried on other Soviet budgets.    If frhis ia frateew4nto account, total Soviet defonoo oponding for 1975 will be ovci&apos;30,000 million roubloo and in roal terms will show an increase of aboutII - hCONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL0-Deployed as they are, theseSoviet forces represent a powerful instrument of war.Their increasing capabilities must be measured not only in termsof military potential, but also as a possible means of reinforcingpolitical pressure without recourse to overt hostilities.9.     The strategic nuclear forces of the West are the ultimatedeterrent against strategic nuclear attack.   But in a period of strategic parity they do not necessarily constitute a credibledeterrent against lower levels of aggression.   For this purpose the West must also deploy credible numbers of conventional and tactical nuclear forces. These can be provided in an effective way only throughthe North Atlantic Alliance, to whose support the G-overnment is fullycommitted.DEVELOPMENTS IN NATO10.   On 26 June 1974 the Heads of Government of North atlantic treaty nations signed a Declaration on AtlanticRelations, previously agreed by Foreign Ministers at the OttawaMeeting of the North Atlantic Council.   The members of the alliance thus re-dedicated themselves to the aims and ideals ofthe North Atlantic Treaty in the year of the twenty-fifthanniversary of its signature.The Defence Planning Committee11.   Meetings of the NATO Defence Planning Committee in ministerial Session were held in June and December 197^-.ii-confidential
Substantial progress continued to be made during the year in improving NATO*s conventional forces in accordance with agreedpriorities, including the important fields of anti-armour and low-level air defence.   In December Ministers agreed that the guidance for future NATO defence planning, which they are dueto issue at their next meeting, should look well into the 1980sand set objectives, within the framework of existing NATOstrategy^for co-operative efforts to obtain maximum efficiencyfrom the force levels and resources which the Alliance can reasonably expect to have at its disposal.   These co-operativeefforts include studies designed to achieve increased collabor-ation and standardisation in the field of defence equipment,greater rationalisation of defence tasks through new co-operativearrangements (particularly in the training and support areas),and improved flexibility in the use of NATO&apos;s forces.   *The Nuclear Planning group?.   As a permanent member, the United Kingdom has continued to play a leading part in NATO&apos;s Nuclear Planning Group.At the regular half-yearly meetings NATO ministers of Defence have kept under review the balance of strategic nuclearforces between the Soviet Union and the United States.    studies are continuing on the political and military implications of possible defensive use of nuclear weapons by NATO.EUROPEAN DEFENCE CO-OPERATION13.   The Government attaches particular importance to european defence co-operation within the framework of the Alliance,especially over the joint procurement of equipment, in order toII-6CONFIDENTIAL
achieve economies and to increase fighting efficiency byenhancing the ability of Allied units to operate together.Successful joint projects so far include the Anglo-FrenchJaguar and the Lynx, Puma and Gazelle helicopters.    We are making good progress with Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany inthe development of the Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) and the medium artillery pieces, FH 70 and SP 70*   Equipment collaborationalso facilitates joint logistic support and training arrangements,like those now being discussed among the five European countries who have agreed to purchase the Lance surface-to-surface missile system from the United States.14-.   In the course of 1974- the Government proposed that theEurogroup should both strengthen its own arrangements for equip-ment collaboration and evolve a rational policy towardsthe procurement of US defence equipment.   As a result of this initiative Defence Ministers agreed at the Eurogroup meeting inJune 197^- thatj in the interests of the Alliance, there was a need to maintain a highly developed technological, scientific andindustrial base in Europe, and at the same time to seek the closest possible co-operation in arms production and procurementbetween the countries of North America   and Europe.   At their meeting in December 1974- the Defence Ministers agreed that compre-hensive joint examination of national forward plans for procure-ment was essential to ensure that worthwhile opportunities for collaboration were taken up.15.   The European NATO countries continue to make a substantial contribution to the strength of the Alliance.   The 01,000 millionII-confidential
CONFIDENTIALEuropean Defence Improvement Programme, was adopted &quot;by theten Eurogroup countries in 1970 (Cmnd. 4592) and was designedto improve the effectiveness of national forces committed to NATO and to accelerate certain common projects of major militarysignificance,,    it is now approaching a successful conclusion.   Inthe communique following their December 1974 meeting, EurogroupDefence Ministers were able to announce plans for the introduc-tion into service in 1975 of an impressive list of major newequipments.16.   The Defence Ministers of the ten European countries par-participating in the Eurogroup have continued to find it a valuableforum in which they can discuss    the majordefence issues facing the Alliance,    and   givedirection to the practical work of co-operation that is carriedout in the various Eurogroup sub-groups.To this end they commissioned and discussed a report on thefuture trends in European defence and reiterated their determination-ation that the Eurogroup should      play      the important partty developing European defence capabilities   most effectively within the framework of the Alliance as awhole.   The Secretary of State for Defence has accepted the invitation of his Ministerial colleagues in the Eurogroup to actas their Chairman during 1975 and it will be the Government1saim to carry this important work forward.The Western European Union (WEU)17. The WEU has continued to provide a means whereby parlia-mentarians from the seven member countries can meet to debateII-confidential
CONFIDENTIALdefence matters and make their views known to the member governments in the WEU Council.EAST/VEST RELATIONS18.   In pursuit of measures of detente, theGovernment is at present engaged with other members of the NATO Alliancein negotiations aimed at establishing a safer and more productiverelationship with the Soviet Union and the countries of eastern europe - in the Conference on Security and Co-operation inEurope in Geneva, where neutral and non-aligned countriesalso participate, and in the negotiations on mutual and balancedforce reductions in Vienna.   The British Government isplaying a full and positive role in both these negotiations.Developments in them are described in more detail below.19.   But progress depends on both sides being willing to negotiateconstructively.   Detente must mean the establishment of long-term,fruitful and mutually beneficial co-operation between states,irrespective of their political, economic and social systems onthe basis of full equality and mutual respect.    Only such progress can reassure those who fear that detente is viewed by some withinthe Warsaw Pact as a device to divide and lull the West while theEast pursues a goal of progressively shifting the balance of power in favour of the Soviet Union.    The West as a whole needs to be convinced that neither force, nor the threat of force will be used against any member of the Alliance or against neutrals, and thatverifiable arms control measures can be agreed which will increaserather than diminish the security of both   East and West,    In thisrespect the current East-West negotiations are an acid test of the determination of both sides to turn the rhetoric of detente intoreality,The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Euror^ (CSCE)20-   35 nations are taking part in the Conference on Security andCo-operation in Europe.    Our aim at the CSCE is to seek to establishII-confidential
a more civilised relationship between the countries of Europe, builtupon trust rather than suspicion and upon actions rather than words.21.   After an initial meeting of Foreign Ministers in July 1973jwhere the full   agenda was agreed, detailed discussions began in Geneva during the following September.    The Conference covers a wide range of major issues,  including political and military security; commercial, economic and technological co-operation;and measures designed to increase contacts among people and thefreer flow of information and ideas.22.   The discussions about the military aspects of security have concentrated on measures designed to increase confidence inEurope about the military intentions of other participants.    Inthis area of discussions, as throughout the Conference, we havebeen working closely with our NATO Allies.   We have been seekingdetailed arrangements for the prior notification on a voluntary basis of major military manoeuvres and movements and the exchangeof observers at military manoeuvres..23.   Progress on the central issues of the Conference has be%$.-slcw.%any of the subjects have, never before been the subject of multi-lateral discussion and most participants are not prepared to agpeeto declarations of Intent which are unsupported by tangible measuresto implement these good intentions.   The Conference is thereforeseeking to give practical effect to the common desire for detente.The Government believes that given sufficient progress on outstandingissties^th^third i*jy*ge of the Conference should be held at summitlevel lib ooon^alr^ic^stble.   The Government also believes thatarrangements should be made to assess progress made in putting thedecisions of the Conference into practical effect, and on this basis ensure that the multilateral dialogue begun at the conference should continue.2U.   a Conference of this kind cannot, of course,  solve all ofEurope&apos;s problems of security and co-operation.    But as a resultof protracted and hard negotiations, we hope that the conference will reach agreement on specific measures which will help to lowerbarriers in Edrope,  contribute to growing understanding betweenEast and West, and increase confidence among all European statesII - 10CONFIDENTIAL
about each others&apos;&apos;political and military intentions.Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions   (MBFR)25.   After a NATO initiative, and following exploratory talksduring the first part of 1973* substantive East/West negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions began in Vienna in October1973.   The general objective of the negotiations, agreed by all governments concerned, is &quot;to contribute to a more stable relation-ship and to the strengthening of peace and security in Europe&quot;.The    aim        of any agreement reached will be to provideundiminished security for both East and West at a lower level of forces.26.   The main concern of the Alliance is the fact that the Warsaw Pacfsconventional ground forces in Central Europe (the area covered bythe negotiations) significantly outnumber those of the West in manpower and major equipments (see paragraphs 3-5 and 7 above).In addition, the Warsaw Pact has considerable geographicaladvantages which would enable any Soviet troops withdrawn as aresult of an MBFR agreement to return swiftly to forward positionsacross only 1+00 miles of land with a choice of many goodreinforcement routes.    Similar forces withdrawn by the UnitedStates would have to cross 3*000 miles of ocean.27.   The Allied negotiators have therefore proposed thateaeh side should reduce its conventional ground forces manpower in Central Europe to a&quot;common ceiling&quot; and that such reductions should take intoaccount current disparities in combat capability.   NATO has suggested that the first phase of reduction leadincr tnwn^e&quot;this ultimate aim of approximate parity should be made by theUnited States and the Soviet Union, both of whom occupy a specialplace in their respective Alliances, and whose military resources are far greater than those of the other participants, &quot;
CONFIDENT IAL28.   For their part, Warsaw Pact negotiators have proposedequal percentage reductions in Central Europe of all the forcesof both sides.    Such an outcome would not correct but wouldperpetuate the current imbalance of forces in the Warsaw Pact*s favour, albeit at lower levels.    It would not contribute to the agreed objective of a more stable relationship; nor would it be compatible with the maintenance of undiminished security for allthe parties concerned.   NATO forces, already smaller than the warsaw Pacfs, could be reduced to a level at which they could not longer constitute an effective defence against the superiorWarsaw Pact forces facing them; in which event their deterrentvalue would be seriously impaired.29.   The outcome of the negotiations will therefore be of crucial importance for the security of the Alliance, and Allied positions and tactics have been closely co-ordinated at every stage.   the unity maintained by Allied negotiators in Vienna is a tribute tothe value of the NATO consultative machinery, and to the willing-ness of Allied Governments to subordinate national airaB andpreoccupations to the common interest.11-12CONFIDENTIAL
jo.   The gap between the NATO and Warsaw Pact positions remainswide and little substantive progress has been achieved so far. But thenegotiations are taking place in a businesslike   atmosphere andthe Government therefore believes that, given goodwill andperseverance by both sidesman acceptable outcome can be achieved.31.   The British Government will continue to work for a successful outcome to the negotiations and does not plan In advance of mutual andbalanced force reductions, to reduce the forces which we maintain in the Federal Republic of Germany below the level agreed inaccordance with the Brussels Treaty.US/USSR Bilateral Negotiations32.   The second phase of the bilateral Strategic Arms LimitationTalks (SALT) began in November 1972.      An agreement in principle was   reached by President Ford and General SecretaryBrezhnev in Vladivostok in November 1974- on an outline ofa  new     agreement on strategic weapons.   This providesfor the limitation of strategic land and sea-based missilelaunchers and bombers to an equal aggregate level of 2,400 on each side.   The introduction of strategic bombers into the negotiations is a notable innovation.   The outline also sets a common ceilingfor each side of 1,320 missiles equipped withMultiple Independently-targetable Re-entry Vehicles (MIRVs). Anew agreement on these lines would be a significant advance on the interim Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement of May 1972 (SALT I) in thatit would effectively establish a state of rough overall strategic equivalance.11-13CONFIDENTIAL
United States tactical nuclear forces in Europe and the nuclearforces of third parties are excluded from the terms agreed atVladivostok.   The British Government welcomes the Vladivostokagreement as an important step towards further limitation of strategic arms and as opening the way to the negotiation of reductions in strategic force levels.   Detailed negotiations between the United States and Soviet Governments resumed in geneva on 31 January 1975.   Together with her NATO Allies, the United kingdom is kept informed of progress in SALT through close consultations with the United States in the North Atlanic Council.33.   The US/USSR summit in Moscow in June and July 1974 alsoproduced significant agreements.   A protocol to the Treaty on anti-Ballistic Missile Systems was signed, reducing to one thenumber of sites in each of the two countries where such systemsmay be deployed.   And a limit of 150 kilotons, to be effective from 31 March 1976, was agreed as the maximum yield ofunderground nuclear weapons tests.   (This agreement does notapply to underground nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes,which are to be governed by another agreement to be negotiatedas soon as possible).11-14CONFIDENTIAL
OTHER ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT DEVELOPMENTS3k.   The United Kingdom, pledged to play a full part in international efforts to reduce the risk of armed conflict, to achieve disarmament and to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons,is actively involved in multilateral discussions of armslimitation and disarmament Issues in the Conference of theCommittee on Disarmament in Geneva and elsewhere.   The Governmentattaches major importance to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons and to the Conference which, in May 1975 in geneva, will review the operation of the Treaty.   As a depositarypower for the Treaty, the United Kingdom is playing an active part in preparations for the Conference.   We also intend to play an active role at the Conference itself.   A joint Anglo-Sovietdeclaration on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons was signed in Moscow on.17 February 1975, which should give furtherimpetus to multilateral efforts to strengthen and ensure the effectiveness of the Treaty.35.   The United Kingdom sent a team of legal, medical and military experts to the Conference of Government Experts held by theInternational Committee of the Red Cross in Lucerne in september and October 197k, to discuss weapons that may cause unnecessarysuffering or have indiscriminate effects.   The Conference produced a report for discussion at the Diplomatic Conference on HumanitarianLaw in Armed Conflict, at which the United Kingdom was alsorepresented.   The Government has contributed constructively to discussion In the United Nations on a number of disarmament issues.11-15CONFIDENTIAL
36.     The Government look forward to depositing, in the near future,the United Kingdom&apos;s Instruments of Ratification of the convention on the Prohibition of Development, Production and Stockpiling ofBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on theirDestruction, 1972, in co-ordination with the Governments of theUnited States and the Soviet Union, and to the consequent entry into force of this Convention.NORTHERN IRELAND37.     It has always been the Governmenfs aim to obtain a politicalsolution to the problems of Northern Ireland.   By acting to elim-inate terrorism, the Services are playing their part in helping tocreate an environment where political progress can be made.   TheServices will remain in Northern Ireland for as long and in suchstrength   as is necessary to achieve this objective.38.     There was a temporary break in Provisional IRA hostilities between 22 December 1974 and 16 January 1975, at which stage violencewas resumed by that organisation.    Both during the ceasefire   and afterwards the Security Forces&apos; activities were related to the levelof violence that occurred.   A further cessation of violence was announced to begin on 10 February.    Certain procedures and safeguardshave been designed to reduce the risk of a fresh outbreak of violence.39.     The beginning of 1974 saw the creation of a power-sharingExecutive in Northern Ireland.   The Executive fell following a strikeled by the Ulster Workers&apos;Council in May.   The Security Forces willnevertheless continue to strive for conditions of peace and stability in which the arrangements for a Constitutional Convention may go ahead smoothly, with the objective of creating new institutionsbased on genuine participation in Government by both communities.40.     In 1974 the Armed Services pursued a steady campaign againstterrorism from whatever source.

The level of violence was significantly reduced and 1974 marked a period of steady progress in restoringlaw and order.41.   During the   year 1,367 people were arrested and charged withoffences of a terrorist nature, of which 155related to murder or attemptedmurder.   188 people were given Detention Orders under the Northern Ireland(Fmergency Provisions) Act.    1,260 firearms,  150,000 rounds ofammunition and nearly 24 tons of explosive were recovered.   Thesesuccesses were reflected in the gradual hut significant reduction inthe nature and number of violent incidents, particularly in thelarge cities.    There were 16 rocket attacks by the ProvisionalIRA in which 24 rockets were fired; and a total of 116 mortarbombs were fired on 16 occasions,  often in conjunction with rocketor small arms fire.    The level of bombing-at a monthly average of57 for 1974 - was lower than in 1973 when the figure was over 81 per month.    Similarly,  shooting incidents-at a monthly average of 267 -were fewer than in 1973 when there were on averageU18 shootings a month.    Since January 1974   74.J7 awards forgallantry have been made to British forces personnel in NorthernIreland. .42.The weakening of the terrorist forces in Belfast andLondonderry and the arrests of many of their leaders   forcedterrorist activities to be diverted to the rural andborder areas,where bombs and booby-traps    were.      used mainly against theSecurity Forces.II - 17CONFIDENTIAL

Close surveillancewas maintained on areas where terrorists or their munitionswere likely to be and possible supply routes     were       intercepted.During the year a number of unapproved border crossing points were effectively closed.kk. The Royal Military Police, whose second Regiment was formedduring 197U, provided invaluable support to the Royal ulster constabulary.    All three United Kingdom-based Royal MarinesCommandos     undertook        peace-keeping duties in the infantry roleand   in 1973   hO Commando, Royal Marines, was awarded a Wilkinson &quot;Swordof Peace&quot; in recognition of efforts to improve community relations in belfast.    In 197h this award was won by the 1st Battalion, The prince of Wales&apos;s Own Regiment of Yorkshire for similar community relations work.    Ships of the Fleet, together with Royal Air Forcelong-range marine craft, maintained anti-gun-running patrols. royal navy craft also patrolled in Lough Carlingford and Lough Foyle.Royal Air &quot;tforce helicopters gave valuable support in operationalsituations.

During 1974 the Regular force level was reduced from 16 to 13major units in the infantry role and now consists of about 14,000men. There were temporary reinforcements     on a number of occasions,  for example in May 1974 during the Ulster Workers&apos;Council strike, and twice in October 1974 during the United KingdomGeneral Election and after the burning of the Maze prison.    Duringthe Ulster Workers&apos; Council strike^reinforcements enabled the army to take over and run on a limited scale the supply of petrol and fuel oils.    A total of 51 major units in the infantry role served in Northern Ireland during 1974   and seven of these were on theirfifth tour.47.    The Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act, which came into force in August 1973, provides limited powers for soldiers to stop, question, search and arrest.    It has been renewed untilJuly 1975 to enable full consideration to be given to the recommenda-tions of the Gardiner Committee (Cmnd. 5847) and any subsequent&apos; &quot;   &apos; iilegislation to be enacted.

The increasing scale and importance of British offshoreinterests and the need to safeguard them is extending the work ofthe Services in support of the appropriate civil authorities.    Themain new development is the exploitation of the gas and oil resources of the Continental Shelf.    To meet these additionalduties^five new vessels will be built for distantpatrols in our offshore waters. These will fill the gap betweenthe small mine countermeasures vessels,at present used for coastalfishery protection work, and frigates.       A number ofexisting RAF aircraft will be modified for offshore surveillance work.Meanwhile,  the present system of patrols by aircraft and frigatesin the area of the offshore oil installations will be supplemented by the deployment of two additional Royal Navy vessels later thisyear,    one of these will be a specially equipped tug,  the Reward,and the other, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries forScotland&apos;s fishery, protection vessel, Jura, which will be taken on loan and manned by the Royal Navy as a warship.Energy Conservation50.   Faced with oil shortages and steeply rising prices,  theServices further tightened their control over fuel consumptionII - 20
CONFIDENTIALduring the winter of 1973-74.   Despite a return to nearly normalsupplies in Spring 1974-, these controls have been maintained soas to achieve an overall saving of some 10 per cent in consump-tion in the financial year 1974-75-    The measures have entailedconsiderable reductions in the use of transport of all types and of domestic fuels.   Although these substantial short-termsavings have been achieved with little detriment to the operationalcapability of the Services, they have cut into the training needed to maintain the high professional standards of our forces.The Services are therefore examining a range of measures designedto achieve greater efficiency in the use of fuel oils and betterfuel conservation so that they can maintain their contributionto the national effort in the longer term   without loss of efficiency.FORCE IMPROVEMENTS51.   The capabilities of the British forces have been enhancedsince 1975   by   the introduction of several new weapons systems and equipments into service.   These include:a.

In addi-tion, the Lance tactical nuclear missile has been ordered from theUnited States.Reinforcement and Mobilisation55.   A thorough review of the United Kingdom&apos;s reinforcement andmobilisation plans is being undertaken.   We expect that, throughrationalisation and other measures to exploit available resources to their full, movement time between the United Kingdom and thecontinent for individual and unit reinforcements (both regular and Reservist) will be reduced by about 30 per cent.II - 23CONFIDENTIAL   .CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL56.   A review of the TAVR was   concluded in 1974.   Therecommendations of that review, which are now being implemented,will enhance the efficiency of the TAVR, both  for     NATOand home defence tasks.   Outside the context of theTAVR review, a further two TAVR infantry battalions and two squadrons of the Honourable Artillery Company are now included among the units earmarked for deployment in an emergency to theBritish Army of the Rhine.MANPOWERService Manpower57,   The raising of the school leaving age had a marked effecton the recruiting figures for 1973-74, when only 25,800 Service-men were recruited.   There has been some recovery in 1974--75     when about 35,000 recruits are expected.   Recruitment is,however, still below the peak of 46,500 Servicemen recruited in1971-72.    Detailed manpower figures are in Annex G.Recruitment into the Womens&apos; Services and the Nursing Servicescontinues to be generally satisfactory.Civilian Manpower \58.    The number of civilian staff for whom provision has beenmade in the Defence Estimates on 1 April 1975 is /&quot;296,0007,approximately /&quot;3,0007 fewer than the equivalent provision at April 1974.   The reduction is largely the result of a short-fall in recruitment of industrial staff.   A further     19,000civilians are employed at the Royal Ordnance Factories   and theircosts will be met from the Trading Fund.II - 24CONFIDENTIAL

In the key NATO areas of the Eastern Atlantic and ChannelCommands, Britain provides the major part of the Alliance&apos;s readily available maritime forces.    A destroyer or helicopter-carryingfrigate is allocated fullTtime as the United Kingdom&apos;s contributionto the NATO Standing Naval Force Atlantic , and one mine counter-measures vessel is allocated full time to NATO&apos;s Standing naval force Channel.   Throughout the last year, the Royal Navy hasoperationally deployed in these areas an average of forty ships of destroyer and frigate size or above, twenty submarines and fiftysmaller ships, supported by Royal Fleet Auxiliaries.7.     A guided-missile destroyer and iwo frigates, which are earmarked for the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)^are currentlystationed in the Mediterranean area.    One of the frigates isdeployed in the vicinity of Gibraltar.    Other destroyers, frigates,submarines and Royal Fleet Auxiliaries have deployed period-caliy   to the Mediterranean.    The Royal Navy contributes to the nato Naval On Call Force Mediterranean and a Royal Marines CommandoGroup is deployed in Malta (although the majority of the Group isserving with UN forces in Cyprus until April 1975).

Some 13,000 Service and civilian dependants and others were evacuated under Army protection from Limassol, Larnaca and, with Royal Naval assistance,  fromPamagusta.    The Royal Navy rescued 1,500 people cut off in theKyrenia area by the Turkish advance and also saved the survivors ofa sunken Turkish destroyer.    During July and August 22,000 people,including dependants of Servicemen and British-based civilians, wereevacuated in 360 RAF special flights to the United Kingdom.

The Royal Navy&apos;s survey vessels have continued their surveyingand charting operations, providing essential navigational informationboth for defence purposes and for commercial shipping interests.Agreements have been reached with the French and Dutch Hydrographersover areas of surveying responsibilities to avoid duplication of effort.    In April 1974 survey vessels of the Royal Navy began a comprehensive and systematic geophysical survey of virtually thewhole of the United Kingdom continental shelf.   The survey is beingcarried out in close co-operation with the Institute of GeologicalSciences under the joint control of the Ministry of Defence and theDepartment of Energy.    This will provide the Government with informa-Hon necessary to ensure the effective exploitation of our sea-bedresources.

Despite the difficulties caused by rising oil prices and its effect on sea and air movement,  the three-day week and its effect on the supply of spare parts,  and more recently by the Cypruscrisis, all three Services have continued to play a major role insupport of the NATO exercise programme.    The Royal Navy, the !;oyalMarines and the Royal Air Force have contributed significantlytowards two major maritime exercises.    The first exercise, DAWNPATROL, was held in the Spring of 1974 in the Mediterranean, underthe direction of the Commander-in-Chief Southern Region, to testall aspects of maritime warfare including an amphibious assault.The second exercise, NORTHERN MERGER, took place in the EasternAtlantic and the North Sea during September 1974, under the jointII1-25CONFIDENT IAL

NORTHERN MERGERwas a large-scale exercise to which all available naval and airforces were committed.    Like DAWN PATROL it included an amphibiouslanding.Jj9.   The Army and the Royal Air Force took part in the NATOexercise, BOLD GUARD,   in Schleswig-Folstein in which the UnitedKingdom Joint Airborne Task Force and a brigade group of the UnitedKingdom Mobile Force, together with a Jaguar squadron, were deployedin support of Allied Command Europe.    Army units have supported NATOexercises in Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany,  Italy, norway and the United States.    The United Kingdom contribution of bothland and air elements to the Allied Command Europe Mobile Forceexercised twice with the Force in 197h,  once in Norway and once in belgium; they also carried out their annual period of Arctictraining in Norway.

RAF Germany and BAOR played a full part in Exercise COLD FIBEin June 1974, which exercised the NATO Tactical Air Forces and theair support organisation of the Central Region.Other Exercises51.    The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force have also continued tosupport a variety of other NATO exercises,  including those concernedwith mine countermeasures and defence against fast patrol boats.Royal Navy submarines have contributed to NATO maritimeexercises of all kinds.    In addition, there has been a full programme of national maritime exercises,  in certain of which theIII- 26CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL

The Mountain and Arctic Warfare Commando Group hasonce again completed a three months&apos; period of winter training innorthern Norway, geared to    its   role on the northern flank of nato.   During this training, the Group was accompanied by a company ofthe Royal Netherlands Marines.    Another Commando Group has carriedout a five-week training period at Suffield in western Canada.53.    Despite commitments in Northern Ireland, Army units in theUKLF and BAOR have continued with a full programme of training. Notably,six full battle groups (out of a planned seven) carried out succesful live firing exercises for armour, artillery,  infantry and engineers at Suffield.    This training contributes greatly tothe operational efficiency of 1  (BR) Corps within NATO; sevenfull battle groups,  six from BAOR and one from UKLF, are againdue to exercise in Canada in 1975.54.

Further details aregiven in Annex J.I ARMY RESERVES2.     The Army Reserves comprise the individual Reserves, consistingof officers and men who have served in the Regular Army,  and theTerritorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR).    The former provides a pool of men to use as reinforcements; the latter,  in the main,provides formed units.3.     The Army General Reserve, consisting mainly of former national servicemen, ceased to exist on 30     June 197h when the relevantlegislation expired. But a newReserve, the Long Term Reserve, was created in 196U.    All men whoJoined the Regular Army on or after 28     February ^^Gh are requiredto be unpaid members of this Reserve, from the end of their period of regular Reserve service until they reach the age of h5*.   Its currentstrength is about 2,000 and is expected to exceed 30,000 by 1980.Meanwhile, the individual Reserves of ex-Regulars, togetherwith the TAVR, provide sufficient reservists to meet the Army&apos;sNATO and United Kingdom commitments on mobilisation.h.     On mobilisation,  the highly-trained formed units of the TAVRwould fill essential roles in either BAOR, certain NATO headquarters,or the United Kingdom Land Forces (UKLF),  supplementing units of theRegular Army with which In many instances they will have trained in peacetime.IV-1CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL

The TAVR reached a record strength of 59,500 during 1972.    this had declined to 54,000   on 1     January 1975   but it is hoped that thisSpring&apos;s recruitment campaign will improve the manning situation.THE ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT7.     The part-time Ulster Defence Regiment forms an integral partof the Security Forces in Northern Ireland and its growing profess-ionalism has enabled it to play an increasingly important role in anti-terrorist operations in support of the Regular Army.    the regiment&apos;s duties include guarding key installations, manningcheckpoints and providing mobile patrols.ft.     The recruitment of women to the Regiment began in Aupnist 1973.The women&apos;8 primary task is searching women for explosives and.weapons.

The numbers of men in the Army who prolong their service have not changed appreciably except at the three year point. The decline in thethree year rate results partly from young entrants&apos; exercising their option to shorten their engagements at the age of 18.   A steady rise in theproportion of recruits choosing the minimum commitment of three years*service and the high.rates of recruit and trained soldier wastagegive cause for concern.Royal Air Force17.    The planned reduction in trained manpower mentioned in Chapter Vof the Statement on the Defence Estimates 1973 (Cmnd 5231) was achieved by normal wastage and a small voluntary redundancy scheme.The rate of prolongation of non-pensionable engagements has shownlittle change and has been satisfactory in most ground trades.The objective is,to limit the recruiting and training taskby prolonging the average length of service; the re-introduction ofthe 15-year engagement has proved a useful addition to the range ofnon-pensionable engagements open to ground tradesmen.

Recruitment details are as follows:All Services (incl Nursing)	1 April-31 December (9 months)		Percentage Difference 1974 over 1973 C+ or -)	1973	1974-	Officers	242	210	-13Servicewomen	3,224	3,960	*23Total:	3,466	4,170	+2019.   A recently concluded review of the future role and organi-sation of the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) proposeschanges       designed to integrate the WRNS more closely intothe Naval Service, to give wider employment opportunities and tomake more effective use of the high quality of officers and ratingsavailable.   These proposals are still being considered.ENGAGEMENT SCHEMESYoung Entrants&apos; Option20.   During the last nine months of 1974-, some 9,500 young entrantsbecame entitled to shorten their engagements on reaching the ageof 18.

In their Third Report (1974), the Armed Forces Pay review body recommended further increases in military salaries, including an increased rate of the   X   factor, to take account for the first time of unsocial hours.   The recommendations were implemented with effect from 1 April 1974.   The basic pay of Servicewomen, exclusive of the   X   factor, was increased from 95 per cent to 97^ per cent of the rate for men.    Other improvements include a new form ofadditional pay for Servicemen in Northern Ireland.22.    The second phase of the review of the Armed Forces pension scheme resulted in the introduction,on 1 April 1973, of substantial improvements in benefits (including widows&apos; pensions)   in casesof invaliding or death, especially when these   are attributable to duty.   The third stage of the Pensions Review has now been com-pleted and the resulting changes will take effect from 1 April 1975.The main effect is to preserve pension rights for those who will serve for at least the specified minimum period of five yearsV-9HON Fgmg[llDENT IAL
GOEFIDENTIALbut not long enough to qualify for an immediate award on retire-ment.   The new arrangements will take the form of the award ofdeferred pensions and terminal grants at the age of 60, although we hope that eventually Servicemen who leave will have their pension values transferred to the pension schemes of their subse-quent employers, in line with the Social Security Act 1973-CONDITIONS OF SERVICEHousing; for Servicemen and their Families23.   Some Servicemen experience problems in obtaining suitablehousing on leaving the Services and measures to alleviate these difficulties are being considered.   The advice given to localauthorities on the provision of council housing for ex-Servicemenhas been reviewed in consultation with the Department of theuEnvironment, /&quot;who have issued J a new guidancecircular.   Improvements are being made to the existing Assisted, iiHouse Purchase Scheme, by increasing the amounts available toparticipants   and by extending the period during which the advanceof pay can be made from the last year of service to the last twoyears.   In addition, a new Assisted House Purchase Scheme is to beintroduced, designed to help those in the Services of 50 years ofage or more to   buy       a house in the last five years of their service.Family Welfare24.   The report of the Naval Welfare Committee, under Lord Seebohm,was published in February 1974.    Its key recommendation, to buildup a professionally-staffed social service to encompass all aspectsof welfare for Naval personnel and their families, has been acceptedV-10CONFIDENTIALCONFIUbN HAL-
confidential and the professional head of the organisation was appointed inNovember 1974-.   Many of the Committee&apos;s further recommendations are being implemented;    others are still being considered.25.   An Army Welfare Inquiry Committee has been set up, and this was announced in the House of Commons during the Defence Debate on13 May 1974-.   The Committee, under the Chairmanship of professor J C Spencer, is well advanced with its task of reviewingwelfare provision for Army personnel and their families in theUnited Kingdom   and hopes to report late in 1975*26.   In the meantime, Army Unit Families Off icers with a special respon-sibility for family welfare (and formerly confined to infantry battalions) are to be introduced in all field force units.   TheHousing Commandant Organisation, which has proved so successful inthe United Kingdom, has been extended to the British Army of the rhine.Cyprus27.   Special arrangements were made to assist with the manyadministrative and domestic problems arising out of the evacuation of families from Cyprus.Improvements of Conditions for Troops in Northern Ireland28.   A great deal of effort is being devoted to improving theemergency accommodation and general amenities for troops inNorthern Ireland.    Improvements include better recreational facilities, a free air-letter card postal service betweenServicemen and their families in Great Britain or in West Germanyand further telephone concessions.V-11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL29-   Leave schemes for those serving in Northern Ireland on four-month emergency tours have been further improved by theintroduction of four days Rest and Recuperation Leave, with free travel to Great Britain or West Germany.   Families of thepermanent garrison may now travel free of charge to Great Britaintwice a year by rail and sea, with entitlements for free car ferrywarrants and sleeping berths for overnight sea crossings.After-Care of Invalided Ex-Servicemen and of British Forces&apos; Widows3C   A special unit has been established in the Ministry of defence to monitor the after-care of soldiers discharged from the Army on medical grounds,   and to provide advice for the widows of thosewho die.Television in Germany31.   The intention is to introduce a live British television service forthe British Forces in West Germany.   All the main concentrations of personnel and families should receive this service within about three years and in the meantime we plan a more restricted recordedservice, starting in those areas where the need for amenities isgreatest.DEFENCE MEDICAL SERVICES32.   Work has been proceeding on the Report of the Defence medical services Inquiry Committee which was set up &quot;To review the arrange-ments for providing medical, dental and nursing services for the armed Services at home and abroad for peace and war in the lightof developments in Defence Policy&quot;.33.   The Report recommended against amalgamating the three medical services   but made a number of proposals for improved machineryV-12CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwithin the Ministry of Defence for co-ordinating and rationalisingmedical and dental matters.        A main suggestion was    for the Defence Medical Services Co-co-ordinating committee     to     assume a new importance and for  the Chief of personnel and Logistics     to     be appointed as its Chairman.   Thisproposal has been accepted and during the last 18 months theCommittee has been overseeing   work on all aspects of the Report&apos;srecommendations.-34.   Two-thirds of the recommendations have now been accepted;in a few cases the acceptance has had to be qualified.    Someof those accepted have been implemented without delay; others are essentially long-term and, even if accepted in principle,cannot be implemented for some years.    Others again are more in the nature of general guidance than specific proposals.   Asmall number of recommendations has not been accepted.   work is still proceeding on the remainder of those recommendations which need detailed consideration.35.   It has been agreed that there should be substantial reduction in thetotal number of beds provided in Service hospitals over the next ten years;    the final figure     following       the Defence Review has yet to be established   but we expect the present number to beV-13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALreduced by about one-fifth.    As the Report had recommended, thefuture use of the new Army hospital at Woolwich was immediatelyreviewed.   This review confirmed the need for the hospital and construction is continuing.    The Ministry of Defence has accepted that there is no longer any Service need for the hospital atCosford   and negotiations are in train for the Royal Air Force tocontinue running the hospital for the National Health Service,It has been agreed that the hospital at Colchester can be closed, oncealternative arrangements have been completed to provide cover forthe Servicemen and their families in the  area.   The Ministry ofDefence accepts the recommendation that the Army hospital at Tidworthand the Royal Air Force hospital, Wroughton, are no longerboth necessary.       The hospital at Tidworth will be closed by April 1977 and units in the Tidworth area will then be served by Wroughton, which will be manned jointly bythe Army and the Royal Air Force.Married Accommodation, Education and Medical Services36.    In Government Observations on the Ninth Report from theExpenditure Committee (Cmnd. 5245), the Ministry of Defence under-took to set out estimated expenditure on medical services,education (largely of Services&apos; children) and married accommodation.For 1975-76, these costs are estimated to be about 5irper cent oftotal defence expenditure, or about one-quarter per cent of GNP, asfollows:  millionMedical Services 85Education 63Married Accommodation 112Total 260V-14CONFIDENTIAL

The Ministry of Defence continues to maintain a close association with universities and other academic institutions through DefenceLecturers, Defence Fellows and a programme of study conferences andseminars,,    An eighth Defence Lecturer has been appointed.    Sixserving officers are holding Defence Fellowships and a ServiceFellowship scheme has been initiated, under which selected service officers spend a residential term at a university carrying outdefence studies of their choice.INITIAL AND SPECIALIST training royal NAVY AND ROYAL MARINESSpecial Duties Officer Candidate Training2.     Special courses are provided for non-technical ratings selected for commissions on the Special Duties List.    In January 197h these courses were moved from HMS St George, Portsmouth, to Britannia royal naval College, Dartmouth, where Direct Entry Officers are trained.Seamen Officer Branch Structure and Training3.     Since 1972 there has been a progressive introduction of thepost of Principal Warfare Officer, trained to &quot;fight the ship&quot; and give his Captain co-ordinated advice on operational matters coveringall aspects of warfare at sea.    After serving as a PrincipalWarfare Officer at sea, about one-third of Seaman Officers will be selected for advanced warfare training which is designed to preparethem to fill more senior posts on sea-going staffs and in someVI-1CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL

As a result,the former Seaman and Communications Branches were combined to formthe Operations Branch on 1 January 1975-   This re-organisation hasentailed important structural changes in the former Seamen Branch,bringing it into line with the rest of the Service in terms ofstructure, training and advancement.Restructuring of the Catering Branch5,   The first of a new style of rating known as Catering Accountantentered the Navy in February 1975.   This development marks thebeginning of a rationalisation of the Naval catering and allied tasksand will lead eventually to the duties of the existing CateringOfficers and Cookery Officers being amalgamated and carried out byCatering Officers with a broader training than hitherto.ARMYOfficer Cadet and Young Officer Training6.    The new pattern of training for the officer entry, introduced at Sandhurst in 1972, is proving successful and only minor refinementshave had to be made to the syllabus.Degree Training7.    169 serving officers (170 in 1973) and 11 University Cadets(13 in 1973) are reading for degrees in Engineering and AppliedScience at the Royal Military College of Science.   In addition,88 serving officers (79 in 1973) and 126 University Cadets (101 in1973) are at universities.Officer Training Review8.

Training of Junior Soldiers9.     In the Statement on the Defence Estimates 1969 (Cmnd. 3927), iwas announced that the Army was examining the arrangements for traiing    the    Junior entry.    The results of this study were announced in November 1973   and the following measures have been implemented:a. the training of Junior Tradesmen has been transferredto the Junior training units ,of individual Arms andCorps   and the Junior Tradesmen&apos;s Regiments at Rhyland Troon have been closed;b. the training of Junior Infantrymen is now carried out at divisional depots and all Infantry Junior Leadersare now trained centrally at the Infantry JuniorLeaders Battalion at Shorncliffe.10.   As explained in Chapter V (paragraph 13). the recruitment ofJuniors, following the raising of the school leaving age, has considerably exceeded expectations ; and other changes announced inNovember 1973, which would have reduced the capacity of the JuniorTraining organisation, will not now take place.    Consequently, forthe time being, the Junior Leaders Regiment of the Royal engineers and the Royal Corps of Transport will remain at Dover and Tauntonrespectively.    It has also been necessary to transfer the trainingof Junior soldier recruits of the Royal Signals to Catterick fromthe Army Apprentices College at Harrogate.    The camp at Oswestryis being retained for at least a further six months (from the previously announced closure date of 1 April 1975) as a JuniorInfantry wing to cater for those Junior Infantrymen who cannot be trained at divisional depots because of a shortage of living accommodation.VI-3confidETOEem,ial

The organisation and resources of Training Command have been reviewed as part of the continued search for economies in training.At the end of 1973   Headquarters 24 Group at Rudloe Manor -responsible for ground training - was closed and its tasks transferredto the Headquarters of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, TrainingCommand^with a saving in staff. A continuing and compre-hensive review of the total training task is enabling the redeploymentof essential training into fewer but more cost-effective units andHoyal Air Force Stations at Manby, Upwood, Spitalgate and Debden tobe closed. Apprentice training has also been reviewed,  in relationto the raising of the school leaving age, and is now being confined to training a substantially smaller number of dual-skill tradesmen.VT-confidential
CONFIDENTIALRECOGNITION OF SERVICE TRAINING15.   Progress has heen made in negotiations with the Council of engineering Institutions (CEI) to ensure that Servicemen achievenationally recognised qualifications on completion of training.These awards include Ordinary National Certificates in engineering and various City and Guilds of London Institute Certificates.    Theeligibility of some categories for registration as TechnicianEngineers (CEI) or Technicians (CEI) as appropriate has been recognised and discussions continue on the eligibility of others.FLYING training royal Navy16.   The RAF continues to provide elementary flying training forRoyal Navy helicopter pilots,using Bulldog aircraft at RAF Leemingfrom November 1974.   The Gazelle helicopter is now in service and hasbeen used by the Royal Navy for basic flying training at the royal naval Air Station, Culdrose since January 1975.17.    On 1 April 197U   the Aircrewman Branch was formed to providethe necessary manpower for aircrew duties, formerly provided byratings loaned from other Branches.    The Aircrewman Branch willprovide a career with advancement based on the development ofaircrewman skills.Army18.    The Army Air Corps trains its own pilots and aircrewmen andthe pilots of the Royal Marines Commando Brigade Squadron.    TheSioux helicopter is being gradually replaced by the Gazelle for flying training beyond the basic stage.Royal Air Force19.     a new pattern of pilot training was introduced towards theend of 197L which reduced training time without lowering standards.VI-5CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCoupled with this new system, pilot training has been reorganised with-in the Royal Air Force Training Command so that it can be carried out more economically and at fewer stations.   RAF Oakington closed in December197U; RAF Church Fenton will be reduced to a relief landing ground by31 March 1975.    In October 1973 all aircrew training, other thanpilot training, was combined at RAF Finningley.20.   The past two years have seen the followingdevelopments :-training has been temporarily suspended.    When it is resumedon a smaller scale, training may be carried out by civilcontract.   The future of the Jetstream, as a replace-ment for the Varsity   in the multi-engine pilottraining role is under consideration;b. the Gazelle helicopter came into service in April 1973and is being used in the Royal Air Force for thetraining of instructors of the three Services;c. the re-equipment of the university air squadrons withthe Bulldog fixed-wing training aircraft, replacing the Chipmunk, started in September 1973 and is nowalmost complete;d. the proposal contained in the Statement on the defence.the Varsity fixed-wing aircraft and the Siouxhelicopter will no longer be msed in   the pilottraining role.   With    reduced futureneeds for such aircraft, multi-engine flyingEstimates 1973   (Cmnd. 5231), that the Argosy shouldbe used to replace the Varsity in the rear crewtraining role, has been reconsidered.   developments in synthetic ground training aids have shown thatVI-6CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsome airborne training can be dispensed with.So the Argosy will no longer be required for flying training.21,   The Jaguar Operational Conversion Unit (OCU), formed atLossiemouth in July 197k from the nucleus of the Jaguar ConversionTeam, now trains pilots for        operational squadrons and will shortly begin post-graduate courses for Weapons Instructors andInstrument Rating Examiners.22.   The transfer of Phantom squadrons to the air defence role made it possible to close the Lightning OCU on 30 September 197k; thePhantom OCU has largely converted from ground attack to air defencetraining.JOINT TRAININGTrl-Service Training23.   The Ministry of Defence favours joint training where it is practicable and economical.    In some areas ( such as Automatic data processing, Nuclear   Biological and Chemical Defence    and Intelligence)training is carried out jointly.     The scope for more jointtraining is limited,   not least becauseexpensive new capital facilities would often be required if jointtraining schemes were to be implemented. But   this is a complex and difficult field and an independent enquiry is to be held inorder to ensure that we take full advantage of joint training.    Mean-while we will continue to study the possibility of further jointtraining   where practicable and economical.   Possible areas for jointtraining are:a.     Initial fixed-wing training for helicopter pilottrainees.VI-7CONFIDENTIALC* C3 fM iSDEEpIii/aL.
b. training of all vehicle mechanics;c. training of Physical Training Instructors.An assessment will alsobe made of the possible uses of modular training and of the impact of Defence Review decisions on training requirements.Adventurous Training24.   The tri-Service Adventurous Training programme instituted in1971 has now become well established.    It provides means by whichServicemen can be faced with tests of courage,  endurance and characterof a kind not otherwise readily available in peacetime.European Collaboration25,   Training collaboration with pur European   Allies   will be activelypursued in the Eurogroup. . All Services are seeking to identify pro-jects for collaboration arising from the introduction of the newtraining methods and new equipment, either on a joint or  singleService basis.   Joint training of forward air controllers is already being successfully undertaken in conjunction with the federal republic of Germany (FRG), and discussions with the FRGare well advanced for        training      personnel to operate and maintain the Lance missile.COMMONWEALTH AND FOREIGN TRAINING26*   Last year over 6,000 officers and men from overseas attendedtraining courses in the United Kingdom.    The Services continued toprovide personnel to other countries to help with local training.PART II:    PRODUCTION AND SUPPORT organisation in THE UNITED KINGDOMROYAL NAVAL MAINTENANCE AND SUPPLY ORGANISATIONHM Dockyards27.

It will be necessary to continue and intensify measures to improve recruitment and productivity ifthe Dockyards are to undertake their planned programmes successfully.28.   In 1975-6, refitting and refuelling of nuclear submarines willbe the major task at both Chatham and Rosyth.    Chatham has recentlybecome capable of refitting two nuclear submarines at the same time(dual streaming).    Rosyth will continue to specialise in the nuclear-powered Polaris vessels.    Both yards will also undertake surfaceship refits.   The programme for Portsmouth includes one major refitand two normal refits of guided-missile destroyers, the normalrefit of the cruiser HMS Tiger, frigate refits and a dual streamprogramme of conventional submarine refits.    Devonport will continueto undertake the major share of Leander class frigate refits.    its programme will also include the normal refit of the assault shipHMS Fearless, conventional submarine refits and nuclear submarinedockings.   Gibraltar Dockyard will continue with a programme ofrefits of frigates and coastal minesweepers.    The Dockyards will alsoundertake work during 1975-6 on a variety of other vessels and craft,including the refits of some Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels atDevonport and Chatham, help with        new construction for the royal navy   and other work for civil customers.29.    Improvements to management systems include new procedures fordockyard resources allocation, refit planning and production control.Action is being taken to introduce a separate Dockyard Vote intothe Defence Estimates for 1976-77.   This will provide a clearer accountability to Parliament and an added stimulus to efficiency.vi-9CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL

Work is almost complete on re-organising the Naval AircraftRepair Organisation, following the assumption of responsibility bythe Royal Air Force for repairing Naval fixed-wing aircraft, andby the ftoyal Navy for repairing the helicopters of all three Services.     Preparations are also well advanced for theoverhaul and repair within the NARO of marine gas-turbine engines for the Fleet.     We are studying ways of improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the NARO,without reducingits flexibility in responding to urgent operational requirements.The Royal Naval Supply and Transport Service (RNSTS)31.   Multi-purpose workshops are being constructed at portsmouth and Devonport to   help   the RNSTS   to servicesophisticated weapons.&apos;  They are a significant improvement on existing maintenance facilities.   Each workshop is self-containedand able to maintain a variety of weapons, with better protection for personnel and equipment in the event of an accident.ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIESIntroduction of a Trading Fund32.   prom 1     July 197U   the operations of the Royal OrdnanceFactories (ROFs) have been financed by means of a Trading Fundinstead of by annual votes and appropriations.       So noVote provision has been made for their operations in defence estimates.    The disciplines and responsibilities of the new fundingarrangements, coupled with the greater autonomy which the TradingVT-10CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALFund has brought, should provide the opportunity and means toimprove upon the high standards maintained in the past.Future Programme33.   Planned production in 1975-76 includes ammunition, explosivesand air-dropped weapons, armoured fighting vehicles and combatreconnaissance vehicles, guns of various calibres (including thenew light field gun), cannon and general purpose machine guns, and contributions to the guided weapons programme.   The ROFs co-operate with the Ministry of Defence&apos;s Research and Development establishments in development     of,       among other things, armoured vehicles, gunsand ammunition.   The organisation - eleven factories and two agencyfactories - is expected to produce an output worth about  123million; some     40 per cent     of this will be for export,  includingequipment for our European Allies.    In common with the UnitedKingdom defence industry, the ROF organisation is making thenecessary arrangements for assuming full responsibility for qualitycontrol   and plans to complete these during 1976.ARMY SUPPORT ORGANISATIONRoyal Army Ordnance Corps Computerised Inventory System34.   The statement on the Defence Estimates 1971 (Cmnd. 4-592) outlinedplans for a computerised Central Inventory Control Point (CICP) atBicester to improve the management of Ordnance materiel.    The CICPwas opened in April 1972 and the Royal Army Ordnance Corps&apos; commodityrange has been   almost     transferred to it.    Control of RAOC stocks inthe British Army of the Rhine has been taken over by an InventoryControl Point (iCP) at Viersen, directly linked with the CICP. control by computer has also been,extended to Berlin andVI-11CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALHong Kong. A trial is planned to takeplace shortly on the use of small mobile computers at inventorypoints within brigades.    The development of a computer-based system to   support     overseas sales continues.    A feasibility study inthe use of computer output on microfilm is well advancedand its introduction early in 1976 shouldachieve worthwhile savings in paper and distribution costs.Availability of Spares35&quot;    The flow of spare parts from industry has been significantly reduced as a result of difficulties over the past year.Vehicles have therefore been used less to conserve stocks.    Sinceoperational maintenance in, for example, Northern Ireland   couldnot be stinted, economies have had to be made mainly intraining.    These constraints on the Army&apos;s normal levels of activityare likely to continue in the immediate future.THE ROYAL AIR FORCE SUPPORT ORGANISATIONEconomy in Support Costs36.   The major review of Royal Air Force manpower and supportrequirements   mentioned in Chapter V of the Statement on the defence estimates .    1973 (Cmnd. 5231)   has already resulted in a saving of some 8,000 Service and civilian posts and should lead to further reductions during 1975-76. This   review, together with various studies directed towards minimising supply and maintenancecosts, forms part of a continuing process to maintain the mostcost-effective support organisation.    For example,    the replacement supply   ADP   System becomes operational in 1975 and will, by1977, have taken over the functions of individual depot computers.VI-12CONFIDENTIAL
confidential the Royal Air Force, with one of the largest real-time computersystems in Europe, will be the first Service to have a totallycentralised network   controlling supply world-wide.There will be over 600 visual display units and associated printersdistributed among all self-accounting units in the United Kingdomand West Germany.    Many routine clerical tasks will be eliminated.37.   A new Controllerate of Engineering and Supply was set up on1 November 1973 and Royal Air Force Engineering and Supply staffsat the Ministry of Defence have been integrated under one controller to provide for        co-ordinated management and development of support in the Royal Air Force. We are examining theextent to which management can be improved by integrating engineering and Supply staffs at Command Headquarters and Royal Air Forcestations.Logistic Support38.   The Royal Air Force is taking full advantage of the opportunities -ties offered by the international collaborative aircraft programmes to reduce RAF support costs.   The principle of inter-dependentlogistics is being followed in developing the support arrangementsfor the Multi-Role Combat Aircraft.INTER-SERVICE CO-ORDINATION OF SUPPORT39.   There has been further rationalisation of supply and engineeringsupport.    Since March 1973 the Royal Air Force has been responsiblefor supplying aircraft spares to all three Services.    The schemefor rationalising the support of new equipments to be used by morethan one Service has gone well.vi-13CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL   .
CONFIDENTIAL 3RD DRAFTjt^O,   As a result of rationalisation, significant progress has beenmade in establishing inter-Service and common support procedures.In order to control this activity, a four year project is inhand   to   achieve   compatibility by the late 1970s between thevarious support ADP systems.    Methods, terminology and data willbe standardised in areas where ADP systems overlap.    eventually the project should enable routine inter-Service transactions tobe carried out automatically, thus increasing effectiveness and economy in manpower.41.    In 1966 the United Kingdom adopted the NATO codification system fornumbering and cataloguing stores and equipment   and all new items are codified under that system.    A programme for retrospectivecodification of items already in use was also put in handand thishas now been substantially completed; in the process some 15 per cent of the items codified were found to be duplicates (that is,identical items held under different reference numbers).    these were eliminated, with consequent ^savings in administrative costs.Discussions are taking place in NATO on possible extensions of thecodification system to   enable detailed information about items ofdefence equipment to be exchanged between Allies.       Thiswould be of value, for example,  in the logistic support of commonweapons systems.LANDS42.   The Defence Lands Committee, under the chairmanship of LordNugent of Guildford, reported in July 1973.    While recognising thatthe amount of land available to the Services to meet their needs -Vl-14CONFIDENTIALCONFIDEN i HAL-

In the United Kingdom, about,000 married quarters will be started and older married quarterestates will continue to be improved.     The increasing number ofService dependants in  West Germany has created a need for additionalschool places and NAAFI families&apos; shops; these are being provided as quickly as resources allow.HIRINGs48.   Hiring married quarters for all the Services will cost about 30 million in 1975-76.   Most of this   spending     is in west germany, where the number of hirings is expected to reach some 25,000by the end of 1975-76, compared with 21,300 at the start of 1974-75.MOVEMENTSk9.

There has been an increase in the movement of TAVR units and individuals for overseas training   and in        sea movement of cargo to the training area at Suffield in Canada.51     At the end of 1973 the Royal Air Force conducted Operation LUCAN,transferring about 30,000 refugees between Pakistan and Bangladesh.52.    The Cyprus emergency in mid-1974 created a big movements task,confideWtiat.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwhich is described in detail in Chapter III (paragraphs 31to 33 ).   The loss of the major civil ports in Cyprus and the lackof alternative port facilities made it necessary to ship all Servicesea freight in Service Landing Ships Logistics (LSLs) unloadingdirectly into the Sovereign Base Areas.METEOROLOGY53.    Meteorological teams       in       the hydrographic survey shipFMS Hecla and two Specially chartered ships took part in a majorinternational experiment (GATE) to study weather systems in thetropical Atlantic.   The Hercules aircraft of the MeteorologicalResearch Flight, with its wide range of instruments, also playedan outstanding role in collecting observations.    A small team ofmeteorologists at Bracknell is collecting, co-ordinating andanalysing the data relevant to larger-scale weather systems and isstudying the possibility of predicting tropical weather patterns.5k*    Preparations have begun to establish a European centre for medium-range weather forecasts at Bracknell.       Thisis a joint venture with a number of European countries and will undertake intensive research into the dynamics of the atmosphereand into techniques of preparing, by numerical methods, weatherforecasts for four to ten days ahead.    It will ultimately issuethese forecasts for use by meteorological services throughout Europe:and is expected to acquire its own computing facilities in due course.vi-17CONflPPfffffflTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL55.    Studies are being carried out, on behalf of the Department ofIndustry, to examine whether large-scale operations of supersonicaircraft in the stratosphere are likely to affect the environment.56.    Collaboration on meteorological satellite projects continues.British-designed instruments to measure stratospheric temperaturesare now being built in the United Kingdom for Inclusion in theUnited States TIROS-N satellite due to be launched in 1977.     TheEuropean Space Research Organisation is also being given scientific and technical advice   about        the European meteorological geo-stationary satellite (METEOSAT) to be launched in the same year.SALES57.   Exports of defence equipment continue to make a valuable contribution to national exports.    Overseas sales of defence equip-ment cover a wide range of items produced by the private sector of industry and by the royal Ordnance Factories.    The Defence Salesorganisation has continued to provide support, assistance and advice to industry, and exports are expected to reach the value of  560million in 1975-76.&quot; wCOSTS AND MANPOWER58.    The costs of support functions, and the Service and civilianmanpower strengths engaged in them, are shown at Annex   B .VI-18CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALVIIRESEARCH AND development cost OF RESEARCH AND development .     In 1975-76 the total cost of research and development(R   &amp;   D) is expected to he  554 million of which researchwill account for  86 million.   An analysis of this expenditurein its six main categories is provided at Annex B.   Actual expen-diture on R   &amp;   D in 1973-74 and forecast expenditure in1974-75 at comparable prices were  483 million and  532 million respectively.   The 1975-76 total of  554 million represents12 per cent of the defence budget compared with 11 per cent in1973-74 and 12 per cent in 1974-75-   Trends in R&amp;D expen-diture following the Defence Review are discussed,in Chapter I,paragraph        JJ.THE RESEARCH programme .     The research programme, which is the responsibility ofthe Controller of Research and Development Establishments and research, provides the scientific and technological base for newweapon and equipment projects.    Research work is carried outmainly in defence-related industries and the R&amp;D Establish-ments, with some assistance from university research laboratory-tories.   The programme involves work in 18 major fields of research (such as aerodynamics, electronics, armaments, ships and submarines), and ranges through basic and applied researchto exploratory development work.3.     The main objectives of the research programme are to initiate and investigate advances in science and technologyrelevant to defence and to determine their application toVII-1CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALweapon systems.   The programme provides the technological basefrom which new Service requirements can be studied and met.    it also seeks to   solve   technical problems and provides theexpertise to tackle promptly the unforeseen problems which inevitably arise during the course of development work andafter the introduction of equipment into service.4.     Of the estimated  86 million for research in1975-76,  16 million will relate to general orbasic research and  70 million to applied research and explor-explanatory development.    It is estimated that research work carriedout in defence establishments, but directed to civil objectives,will result in receipts of  18 million.   This reflects reductions in the civil aerospace work supported by the Department ofIndustry.RATIONALISATION OF R &amp; D ESTABLISHMENTS  .,,5.     The first stage of the rationalisation of R &amp; D Establish-ments, announced in the 1973 Statement on Defence Estimates(Cmnd. 5231), is being implemented.   The rationalisation programme is based on a structure of four &quot;Systems&apos; Establishments   (eachconcerned with one of the main defence environments - sea, land,air and underwater), complemented and supported by a number of&quot;Technology&apos; Establishments.6.     The Systems Establishments help the appropriate service or Services to evaluate major weapon   systems and equipment, andare responsible for supporting their development and introduction into Service use.   The co-ordination of the development of thesub-systems of a proposed new weapon or equipment is highlyVI1-confidential
CONFIDENTIALspecialised, is vital to the overall success of the project, andrequires the closest working relationship between R&amp;D Estab-lishments, Royal Ordnance Factories, industry and the Services.However, it is neither practicable nor economic to make theindividual Systems Establishments self-sufficient in all thetechnologies required, particularly where these technologiesare common to all or several environments or relate to a variety of likely users.   They will therefore be supported by TechnologyEstablishments which concentrate on specific technologies andthe appropriate sub-systems (such as communications and engineeringequipment or propulsion units).7-     Proposals   being considered     for the second stage of the rationalisation programme are concerned with Establishmentsengaged in marine, explosives and materials technologies.    any changes will be the subject of consultations with the Staff andTrades Union Sides and other interested parties before any decisions are taken.INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION8.1   The advantages of collective procurement of defence equipment are set out in Chapter II (paragraphs /   JJ and /  -7)-The British Armed Services and industry can fairly claim to bein the forefront of the movement towards international collab-oration.    Collaborative projects currently in developmentinclude the Anglo-German-Italian Multi-Role Combat Aircraft;two major artillery weapons, the SP 70 and FH 70, on which thesame three countries are collaborating;    and the Anglo-FrenchLynx helicopter.   These and other co-operative ventures willVII-confidential
CONFIDENTIALaccount for about 15 per cent of the money to be spent on research and development in 1975-76&apos;9.     Collaborative development is possible only when the defence equipment needs of two or more nations are similar.   The aim must bto identify these needs so far in advance that national planning can be collaborative.   To this end, the UnitedKingdom is an active member of all the Allied organisations which seek to promote equipment collaboration, and maintainsnumerous direct bilateral and multilateral relationships forthis purpose with our NATO and Commonwealth partners.   The effort to reconcile different military, economic and industrial require-ments and time scales is substantial, and for the most parttangible results on further projects are more likely to appear in the 1980s and 1990s than in this decade.DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES 1975-7610.   The management of the development programmes is the respon-sibility of tne appropriate Systems Controller in the ProcurementExecutive - the Controller of the Navy, the Master-General ofthe Ordnance, or the Controller of Aircraft.   The principalprojects now in progress are set out in the following sections.AIRCRAFT AND AIRCRAFT WEAPONSThe Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA)11.   The strike/attack/reconnaissance version of the MRCA hashigh priority in the aircraft programme.   The swing-wing designwill give the aircraft great operational flexibility.    Itsadvanced electronic equipment will enable it to deliver weaponsVII-a confidential
accurately, in all weather conditions and at night;    and ataltitudes which will minimise its vulnerability to defensivesystems.12.   The first part of the development phase was completed inSeptember 1974 after the aircraft had made a successful firstflight on 14 August 1974.    The second part of the developmentphase has now begun   and will last until the end of 1975-    progress will be reviewed around the middle of the year.    Preparation workfor production has been authorised.    Project definition is underway in the United Kingdom of an air defence variant for theRoyal Air Force, to be equipped with an advanced new radar andair-to-air guided weapons.Lynx13-   The Lynx twin-engined helicopter is at an advanced stage ofdevelopment and production work has now begun.   First delivery to the British Services is expected in 1976.   The Lynx is notablefor its speed and range and will improve the operational capa-bilities of the Royal Navy&apos;s new classes of frigates and destro-yers, enabling them to attack submarines with light-weighttorpedoes, and surface vessels with the planned Skua missile(see paragraph 20 below).   Lynx will also carry outs u r v e i llance       and     reconnaissance.A utility version to carry anti-tank guided weapons isbeing developed for the Army;    it will also be used forcasualty evacuation, as an airborne command post,for directingartillery fire and for the rapid movement of men and supplies.Hawk14.   The HS 1182   two-seat trainer, now named the Hawk, is in full dev-development and made its first flight successfully last summer. It will be usedVII-5CONFIDENTIALCONHUblSiriAL

It will be the first British-designedmilitary aircraft to be built to metric standards and will bepowered by a version of the Adour engine used in the Jaguar.Nimrod15.   Major modifications to the radar, navigation, acousticand tactical systems of the Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft are being developed to improve its capability to detect,shadow and attack submarines and surface vessels.New Airborne Early Warning System16.   The provision of a new airborne early warning system in the longer term is being studied.   The airborne early warning taskis at present undertaken by the Gannet and Shackleton force.Ground Attack1?-   Methods of improving conventional weapons to increase theRoyal Air Force&apos;s air-to-ground attack capabilities in the1980s are being studied.GUIDED WEAPONSSea Wolf18. Sea Wolf, a short-range surface-to-air guided-weapon system,is being developed primarily to provide ships with a means ofVII-6CONFIDENTIALconfidential
CONFIDENTIALself-defence against fast low-flying missiles.    Its capabilityto intercept incoming missiles has already been demonstrated\\and parts of the system have been installed in HMS Penelopefor sea trials.    Sea Wolf is planned to come into service inType 22 and other frigates later in the decade.SS11 Replacement19.    Evaluations continue of possible helicopter-borne anti-tank guided weapons to replace the French SS11 missile.Skua20.    Project definition is complete on the Skua all-weatheranti-ship missile and some initial development is taking place,pending a decision to proceed to full development and production.Skua is designed to be fitted to Lynx helicopters and willprovide destroyers and frigates with an over-the-horizon strikecapability.Underwater-to-Surface Guided Weapon (USGW)21.    Studies are continuing into an underwater-launched air-flightguided-weapon system, to come into service in the early 1980s as themain armament of the submarine fleet against surface ships.Sparrow Improvements22.    A new British homing head and fuze is in full development for the American Sparrow medium-range air-to-air missile already in service with the Royal Air Force.ELECTRONICS23.    R &amp; D in the electronics field covers a wide range of projects designed to meet the needs of all three services.    Projects vary in size from small night-visionvn-7CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
C ONFI DENT IALequipments to a major tactical communications system for-theArmy and the Royal Air Force.   The programme includes work;,on navigation, detection, electronic countermeasures, communi-cations, data-handling and simulation and involves developingnew equipments and improving existing ones.   Among currentprojects are:a.,    radar equipment and avionics for the MRCA,enabling it to operate in all weathers by day and night;b.    the DN 181 all-weather tracking radar, whichwill give the Rapier low-level surface-to-airguided-weapon system a blind fire capabilityat night and in poor weather.   The radar isapproaching the final stages of development. .   maritime search radars for Nimrod and Lynxcapable of detecting ships and submarines inunfavourable sea conditions;a laser target-marker for forward air con-trollers, which will improve their ability to designate targets for aircraft providing closetactical support;new sonars, with improved detection and classi-fication capability, for use in frigates^f.    new sonars, for use in submarines, to increase their effectiveness, against quieter submarines in the next decade.   A complementary studyinto a submarine detection equipment systemVII-8CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
for Royal Navy helicopters is in progress;electronic warfare equipment for the three services, including sophisticated electroniccountermeasures equipment for the MRCA and search receivers for Royal Navy ships;h.    a variety of night-vision aids for use onweapons and in vehicles, improving theServices&apos; ability to move and fight by night;jl.    the Ptarmigan tactical trunk communicationssystem for the Army and Royal Air Force in central Europe.    Ptarmigan is designed to conform with the standard EUROCOM character-istics agreed by the Eurogroup, to ensure thatit will be compatible with the future communi-cations systems of our Allies.SHIPS AND EQUIPMENTShip Propulsion24.   Considerable effort is being devoted toR     &amp;     D     on propulsion units for the future Fleet.    Forsurface ships the Royal Navy has made considerable use of gas-turbine engines derived from aircraft engines, using the rolls Royce Tyne and Olympus.    By the end of the 1970s, mostnew surface units of the Fleet will be powered by marine gasturbine engines.    Development work is in hand on both the   -Tyne and the Olympus to increase the period between overhaulWork is also going ahead to improve one j.yne&apos;s performance.VII-confidential
A project definition study to investigate the possible use ofthe Rolls-Royce Spey engine in ships has begun.Submarines125-    Design and development work continues on future nuclearsubmarines and their propulsion units.Torpedoes26.   An advanced light-weight torpedo is being developed tobe launched from helicopters, aircraft and surface ships asa counter to the high-performance submarines expected in the1980s.   The Hark 24 submarine-launched torpedo, Tigerfish, isbeing improved.        ,Non-Magnetic Machinery27.   The development of non-magnetic machinery for the newclass of mine countermeasures vessel is going well, and the prototype main propulsion and ships&apos; services diesel enginesare now undergoing trials.Waste Disposal28.   Better ways are being sought to dispose of all types ofwaste from HM Ships in a further effort to improve environ-mental and operational conditions.Hovercraft29.   Possible Fleet roles for the hovercraft continue to be studied. uORDNANCE AND OTHER ARMY EQUIPMENTArtillery \\30. Development of two major artillery systems, the 155mm towedFH 70 howitzer and the self-propelled SP 70 gun, continues inVII-10CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
co-operation with the Federal Republic of Germany and with italy.    When these weapons are introduced, 155mm will bethe standard calibre for close and general support guns.The SP 70 will replace the 105mm Abbot SP gun, the 155mmM109 and possibly the 175mm M107 equipments.    The FH 70will replace the 5-5 inch medium gun.Main Battle Tank51.    Concept studies of the future main battle tank are being undertaken in co-operation with the Federal Republic ofGermany.    Development of a new tank gun is further advanced andit is hoped largely to standardise tank guns and ammunitionwithin NATO as a result of a tripartite evaluation of British,American and German designs at trials which have now begun.Other Combat Vehicles52.    Prototypes of the combat engineer tractor are undergoingtrials.   This equipment will enable the Royal Engineers to perform many of their tasks protected by armour;    it will dig,bulldoze and winch, lay trackway, handle pallets, and launchpontoons.    It is amphibious and has a rocket-propelled anchor,allowing it to winch itself up steep banks.    It should provideconsiderable help to mechanised units in river-crossingoperations.33-    Other projects in progress include:a,,    a mechanised infantry combat vehicle, whichwill replace the FV 430 series;b.    a new range of vehicles for battlefieldlogistic support;    andVII-11CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
confidential..    improvements for Chieftain including an advanced fire-control system.Mines34.    Development is well advanced of a new anti-tank mine,with increased lethality, and of an associated anti-personnelmine.Small Arms35.    Development has begun of a new family of small armsand ammunition to replace the 7*62mm self-loading rifle,   the9mm sub-machine gun, and the 7.62mm general purpose machine gun in the light role.   This family is planned to contend in nato trials to select the small arms ammunition on which NATOforces may standardise as far as possible in the future.QUALITY ASSURANCE36.    Our policy continues to he to place maximum respon-sibility on the contractor for the quality assurance of hisproducts.    Since April 1973 new quality assurance requirements,published as Defence Standards, have applied to most contracts for defence materiel placed by the Procurement Executive.   the procurement Executive     assesses     the quality control and management systems of its suppliers against the requirementsof the Defence Standards, with the agreement and full co-operatof the defence industries.VII-12CONFIDENTIAL
