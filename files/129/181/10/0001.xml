cabinet public EXPENDITURE WHITE paper memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer, I attach a draft White Paper embodying the decisions on public expenditure which we took at our meeting on 25 November (CC(74) 49thConclusions, Minute 3).THE BASIS OF THE WHITE PAPER2.        The expenditure figures are consistent with our decision that total public expenditure should be held to an average annual increase of Z\ percent in demand terms, starting from the 1974-75 level shown in the Surveyreport.    This was originally estimated to permit an average increase inprivately-financed personal consumption of 1. 5 per cent a year.    Theestimates used in the White Paper are however the latest revisions of thatoriginal material.    The new projections indicate that the balance ofpayments and private investment may require rather more resources, witha consequent reduction in the resources available for public expenditure and personal consumption, taken together.    The usual resources table(Table 1,1 on page 5) shows that, on the central case, the presentexpenditure programmes are now estimated to be compatible with aa averagegrowth in priyately-financed consumption of just over 1 per cent a year.This does not necessarily imply a steady rise year by year, small as itwould be.    There could be setback and recovery,THE TEXT3.        We must, however, consider with particular caj?e the impact whichpublication of this White Paper will make.    Our ability to continue to finance our balance of payments deficit will depend critically on externalconfidence in the management of our economic affairs.    The risks of a lossof confidence, in the light of our continued huge current account deficit andaccelerating rate of inflation, have been growing,-    -. &apos; si1C(75) 10 COPY NO21 January 1975

PART public Expenditure General ReviewIntroduction1. This White Paper sets out the Governmenfs public expenditure plans for the years 1974-75 to 1978-79.2. In drawing up these plans, the Government have been concerned todo two things:  to strike the right balance between the demand placed on resourcesby public expenditure and by exports, investment and private consumption;  to bring the public expenditure programmes into line with the government&apos;s general priorities and objectives.The general background3. In carrying out this review, the Government have taken full accountof three major factors which bear on either the scale or the composition ofthe public expenditure programmes.4. The first of these factors is the balance of payments deficit, which hasbeen greatly aggravated by the oil crisis. The increase in the price of oil sincethe autumn of 1973 now represents a claim on our resources equivalent toroughly 4 per cent of our national output.5. By the end of the period covered by this White Paper, we can look forward to meeting most of our own oil needs from domestic sources, andthis puts us in a position of great advantage compared with some otherindustrialised countries. But even before the oil crisis, we had a large balanceof payments deficit. We must aim to close the non-oil deficit as soon aspossible and to go on to achieve an overall balance taking account of the costof servicing accumulated debt. This claim on our resources affects the total amount of public expenditure which can be afforded, and makes it all themore important to establish clear priorities between the various programmes.
6. Secondly, the composition of public expenditure has been modified to reflect the importance the Government attaches to certain key social pro-grammes in the pursuit of its economic objectives. This has required additionalspending on a number of programmes: notably social security, housing and subsidies. Higher priority for such programmes, however, inevitably meanslower priority for others.7. Thirdly, there is the need to improve the underlying growth in output,which provides the only real source of improvements in either public or private consumption. To do this, we must increase our productive investment as well as making the best use of our present productive capacity, and ensuring a more rapid increase in productivity. In the longer term, this is relevant tothe permissible scale of public expenditure, but more immediately it affectsits composition. The Governments expenditure plans in this field includeadditional investment in the nationalised industries; regional, industrial and agricultural support; manpower and training policies; and the further measuresindicated in the White Paper on the Regeneration of British Industry (Cmnd.5710).8. Against this general background, the next two sections deal, in greater detail, with the place of public expenditure in the economy as a whole, andthe broad movement in public expenditure and its allocation betweenparticular programmes.Public expenditure and the nation&apos;s resources9. The size of public expenditure, and its rate of growth, must be related to the total of resources available and the strength of competing claims.The purpose of this section is to look at the use of the nation&apos;s resources,and the part that public expenditure will play in this, over the next five years.The starting position   ,A10. The distribution of total national expenditure* in 1973 is illustratedin Chart 1 on page 3.11. In 1973, the country was using up more goods and services than itwas producing, so that there was a deficit in the balance of trade. This is represented in the chart by the small inner circle. The total area outside the inner ircle represents what we produced. Of what we spent, the chart showsthat roughly one-fifth went on investment, and four-fifths on current consumption.12. Of the amount spent on investment, 15 per cent was spent by the nationalised industries; and another 25 per cent by other public bodies,including central and local government, on school, hospitals, houses, roadsetc. 20 per cent was spent by the private sector in manufacturing industry;and the remaining 40 per cent on other private investment, including a wide range of capital expenditure, from North Sea oil platforms to office blocks.: *The figures in paragraphs 10 to 32 are all at prices of 1970, which is the baseyear c-f the constant price national accounts. Expenditure is shown at factor cost,excluding net indirect taxes.
CHART 1: USE OF RESOURCES IN 1973Note: The total area of the circle in Chart 1 represents the domestic use of resources; thesmell circle in the centre represents the net inflow of resources from overseas (i.e. the deficit on the belance of payments); and the remainder resources produced at home (the GOP).CHART 2: USE OF THE INCREASE INRESOURCES BETWEEN 1973 AND 1979PublicPrivate butpublicly financedI Privately financedNote; The total area of the circle in Chart 2 represents the increase in home-produced resources (the GDP);part of this increase will be needed to rectify thebalance of payments (the centre circle) while the restWill be available for use at homo.
13. Of the amount that was spent on domestic consumption, the shareconsumed directly by the public sector was roughly a quarter. This coversnational and local expenditure on services such as health, education, defence,and the police. Although it does not appear as money in the individual^pocket, his standard of living benefits from the provision by the community of, for example, a national health service and free education.14. The remaining three-quarters of consumption consisted of personal consumption, ie spending by individuals and families. As the Chart shows,this in turn falls into two parts. One part consists of goods bought with wagesand salaries and with income from self-employment and profits (&quot;privately-financed&quot; consumption). The other part is consumption financed by benefits and subsidies provided by Goverment. The cost of providing these &quot;transfer payments&quot; is included in total public expenditure, and affects the general levelof taxation, but the goods bought with them form part of personal con-sumption.The use of resources to 197915. How will this picture change over the period to 1979? Clearlythere are big uncertainties in looking this far ahead. Table 1.1 there-fore illustrates a range of possibilities, based on different rates of growth of domestic output.16. The central case in Table 1.1 (Case II) assumes that gross domestic product (GDP) will increase by about 3 per cent a year. This allows for some increase in the working population,1 and assumes that productivityimproves at about the rate in line with past trends. It also assumes thatthere will be no undue slack in the economy at the end of the period.17. Of the remaining two cases, the first (Case I) assumes a morecautious view of the growth of GDP, which would be increasing at about2i per cent. The other (Case III) is based on a more optimistic GDP growth rate of 3^ per cent. The table illlustrates the consequences of maintaining the public expenditure programmes in each case*.18. Under Case I, there would be a smaller volume of, resources available than in the central case. Rather less might be needed for thebalance of trade and for private investment; but the main weight of thereduction would have to fall on public expenditure and personal consump-tion. With present public expenditure programmes, there would be virtually no room at all for growth in privately-financed consumption. Some adjust-ment would thus be necessary in the disposition of the available resources.19. Under Case III, there would be a faster growth in available re-sources. Rather more would be needed for the balance of trade and for private investment, but most of the additional resources would be availablefor other spending. Here again, a choice would need to be made of theway in which the additional resources should be shared out.* The table does not take account of the effect which differences in the GDP growth rate might have in practice on the need for nationalised industry investment and on thelevel of those social security benefits which are linked to earnings.

The coverage of the public expenditure figures given in Section B.3 of this table differs in some respects fromthat used generally in this White Paper, for the reasons explained in the notes in Part 4, Section IV (page 167).
The centred case20. Under the central case, the average increase in GDP each year would be about  1,500 million*. The allocation of these additional resourcesis illustrated in Chart 2 on page 3.21. A substantial part of the average annual increase about  360 mil-lion would need to be absorbed by the balance of payments as the externaldeficit is eliminated. This is represented by the inner circle in Chart 2.22. Since 1973, the increase in oil prices has greatly increased the external deficit. This cannot be dealt with all at once. Until the oil-producing countries are able to absorb goods and services to match their new wealth,massive international borrowing is inevitable.23. Such borrowing will however mean that we shall have to findmore resources later on to service our increased debt. Part of the shift of resources into the balance of payments will be accomplished by substitutingNorth Sea oil for imported oil. But a substantial part of the shift can onlybe achieved by expanding our exports of goods and services faster than our imports.24. Next, investment. In the private sector, investment (includingstockbuilding) rose sharply in 1973 but a substantial further increase in private industrial investment will be needed between 1973 and 1979 inorder to match a 3 per cent growth rate in GDP. North Sea oil explorationand extraction will also require a massive; investment programme. private investment**, therefore, is estimated to rise by 5-4 per cent a year over theperiod and to take  330 million of the average annual increase in resources.25. Investment in the nationalised industries is estimated to rise on average by 3-6 per cent a year, in order to provide adequate supplies of energy and other basic services. This takes a further  50 million from theannual increase in available resources. \26. After taking account of these requirements an average annual increase of  780 million remains available for other public expenditure and personal consumption**. This is equivalent to an average growth rate of 1-8per cent a year. Under Cases I and ITI the rates of increase would be 1-4 percent and 2-1 per cent respectively.27. From this amount, provision has to be made not only for much-needed improvements in social and other public services, but also for im-improvements in the real level of personal consumption, including consumption by wage-earners and their families, and by pensioners. The governments plans envisage that  240 million a year on average would be devoted to increasing public expenditure on goods and servicesf. Under the centralcase, this would leave an average annual increase of  540 million for personal consumption.* At 1970 factor cost prices, see footnote on page 2.** In this analysis, private investment in housing is included under personal consumption.t Excluding nationalised industry investment.
28. Within the total of personal consumption, the priority which hasbeen accorded to improved social security benefits means that consumptionfinanced by such benefits will be rising faster than &quot;privately-financed&quot; con-sumption (ie mainly consumption paid for out of pay and profits). Publiclyfinanced personal consumption is planned to rise at an average annual rateof 4-4 per cent throughout the period, while &quot;privately-financed&quot; consump-would be rising, under the central case, at 1.1 per cent. In the two variantcases, the rate of increase of &quot;privately-financed&quot; consumption would be 0- per cent and 1-7 per cent respectively. In all three cases, the rate of increase would be significantly less than the growth rate of output, and this suggeststhat there would be an increase in the burden of taxation.29. The total of all personal consumption would be rising, under thecentral case, at an average annual rate of 1-8 per cent. The correspondingrates of increase in the two variant cases would be 1-3 per cent and 2-2 per cent respectively.30. The projections described above have been based on the latestavailable assessment of developments in the economy over the period. Thetwo variant cases underline, however, the uncertainty of prediction. It isthe Governmenfs aim to improve the underlying rate of productivitythrough its industrial and general economic policies. Such improvements will however take time to mature. For resource planning purposes, it would be imprudent to assume a higher growth rate until it can be seen to be achiev-able within the period under review.31. This is, however, only one of the uncertainties which affect, in come degree, the amount of resources available for domestic use. Others includematters external to the United Kingdom. Developments in world trade, inparticular, will be critically important. The variants in the table can onlybe regarded as giving a very broad illustration of the combined effect of possible changes both in the growth of GDP and,in other variables affectingthe level of available resources. But more extreme variants remain possible.&apos; 32. The Government will therefore continue, in the course of theirregular reviews of public expenditure, to take stock of the resources likelyto become available and to make any modification in either direction which may be necessary in the various expenditure programmes.Public expenditure Allocation to programmes33. The second main aim of the Governmenfs review of public expenditure has been to look at the priorities attaching to the various pro-grammes and adjust them in the light of the Governmenfs general social,industrial and economic policy. The general analysis in the following para-graphs indicates the main priority areas, and distinguishes the main trends in public expenditure on goods and services and on transfer payments.Except where otherwise stated the figures are at constant 1974 survey prices. *-    II* See the notes in Part 4, Section II, page 164.
General priorities34. An indication of the Governmenfs general priorities has alreadybeen given in the introduction to this White Paper. In the social field therehave already been substantial increases in some programmes, including social security benefits, housing, and expenditure on various forms of price re-straint. The Government have carried out their pledge to increase retire-ment pensions to  10 for a single person and  16 for a married couple. Ex-penditure on pensions and other long-term benefits will grow in real termsduring the Survey period as they will in future be uprated in line with earnings. New forms of help will be introduced for the disabled and plans for a better long-term pension scheme have been published. Family allow-ances will be increased in April 1975; and support for families will be ex-tended by a new scheme for child benefits, covering all children including thefirst, as soon as resources and administrative considerations allow. Thefigures for social security in this White Paper make no specific provisionfor the child benefits scheme and additional expenditure devoted to thiswould be a charge on the contingency reserve.35. On housing, the public investment programme has already beenstepped up, and housing subsidies have also been greatly increased. restraint of rents and prices has been a key element in the Governmenfs immediatecontribution to the restraint of inflation. Rents cannot however stay frozenindefinitely, and the rent increase in 1975-76 is being moderated by a specialsubsidy limited to that year only.36. As regards other price subsidies,, there is a conflict, particularly with regard to the nationalised industry subsidies, between the objective of price restraint and the need for the containment of budgetary imbalanceand for economy in using resources to which the subsidies apply. Pricesubsidies in the nationalised industries are therefore to be phased out; andthe Government will also aim to reduce expenditure on food subsidies dur-ing the course of the Survey period.37. The other main priority area is expenditure designed to increase efficiency and output. The expenditure programmes will contribute to thisthrough the productive investment of the nationalised industries; throughregional and industrial support; and through manpower and training policiesdirected towards the improvement of the industrial base and better utilisation-tion of labour in the economy, and hence to future growth. Priority willalso be given to a policy of continued support for efficient agricultural pro-duction.38. Some industrial policies, notably those associated with the national enterprise Board and nationalisation measures, have not yet been fully de-developed, and the specific provision for industrial expenditure in this white paper thus certainly understates the likely future level of spending, whichwill require some call on the contingency reserve.
39. The expenditure programme figures given in this White Paperreflect the broad priorities indicated in the preceding paragraphs. Giventhe general limitation on resources, additional expenditure on services of high priority must however inevitably imply tighter restraint on other ser-vices. This restraint has applied especially to capital expenditure as well asto current expenditure on many programmes. While the programmesgenerally allow for continuing real improvement over the period, the pace ofimprovement must be governed by the resources available, and no pro-gramme, however great its priority, can be left free to grow without taking account of the general economic constraints. Priorities will also need to berigorously established in the administration of the various programmes and greater stress will need to be placed on getting the best value for money.40. These considerations apply particularly to expenditure by localauthorities, which is analysed in Tables 2.18 and 3.9 on pages 130 and 156.In the three years since 1971-72 current expenditure by local authorities hasbeen rising at an annual rate of about 8 per cent, and their current expenditure on goods and services at about 5i per cent. In present economic circumstances, growth rates which so far outstrip the growth of national resources cannot be accommodated. The growth rates indicated in this white Paper represent the most which, in the Governmenfs view, can nowbe afforded. Local authorities&apos; expenditure, and their demand on man-power, will therefore need to be subject to continuing restraint, and theGovernment will be in close touch with the authorities to consider thebest ways of achieving this.Goods and services41. Table 1.2 shows public expenditure on goods and services, analysedby main programme, in 1973-74, 1974-75 and 1978-79. The increase between1973-74 and 1978-79 is equivalent to an average annual increase of 2*4 percent.42. About half of public expenditure on goods and services is accountedfor by three large programmes health and personal social services, edu-cation and defence. These are programmes where current expenditure pre-dominates, largely reflecting their substantial use of manpower. The nextgroup in terms of size nationalised industry capital investment, housing,roads and transport, and other environmental services  all have a large capital expenditure content. Between them they account for over three-quarters of public investment.43. Of the programmes which account for the bulk of investment expenditure, most of the increase goes to capital investment in the national-ised industries, reflecting general priority given to greater productive invest-ment.

Investment in housing has been increased very substantially in1974-75. The subsequent reduction thereafter does not represent a decline in new building but reflects the expected reversion to lower levels of expendi-ture on improvement and renovation following a period of intensive activityby many local authorities. The figures also do not include the large and growing amount of publicly-backed housebuilding by housing associations(grants and loans to these by the Housing Corporation and by localauthorities are included in Table 1.3).45. Little change is planned in expenditure on roads and transport.Capital expenditure on other environmental services has been reduced, butthat on water and sewerage is planned to recover significantly: much ofthis is in support of the housing programme.46. Of those programmes where current expenditure predominates thebulk of the increase is devoted to health and personal social services andto education. The trade, industry and employment programme provides for industrial training to be built up and for increases in other employment and manpower services during the Survey period. A substantial increase is alsoplanned on expenditure on law, order and protective services.47. The forecast expenditure on defence takes account of the announce-ment by the Secretary of State for Defence on 3 December 1974*. By com-parison with previous plans, it represents a reduction in 1978-79 of about 500 million.* House of Commons Official Report, columns 1351-1357.

Table 1.3 shows expenditure on transfer payments and net lending,analysed by main programme, in 1973-74, 1974-75 and 1978-79. Excludingdebt interest, which is treated as a special category and not allocated to specificprogrammes, the increase between 1973-74 and 1978-79 is equivalent to anaverage annual increase of 3.7 per cent.49. About half of the total expenditure (excluding debt interest) consists of social security payments, including pensions, family support, and supple-mentary benefit. In the present financial year these amount to around  6,600million. A further  2,000 million goes on the trade, industry and employmentprogramme: including support for nationalised and private industry, regionalindustrial aids, refinance of export credits, and, at present, compensation to nationalised industries for price restraint.50 Housing subsidies and loans amount to nearly  2,000 million.Education grants, at about  1,000 million, comprise mainly grants to universities (which in fact largely represent a direct claim on goods and services): and grants to students for fees and maintenance. The figure for agriculture (about  1,200 million) includes agricultural support and food subsidies. Overseas services ( 600 million) includes both overseas aid and netpayments to the European Economic Community.
51. The total expenditure on transfer payments and net lending in1978-79 is planned to be  2,200 million higher than in 1973-74. About two-thirds of this amount will go towards improving social security payments, butthere are also substantial changes each way in some other programmes. the forecast fall in trade, industry and employment, for example, reflects the phasing out of price restraint subsidies to nationalised industries, althoughregional industrial assistance, also in the same programme, is forecast toincrease substantially.52. The reduction under agriculture reflects the intention that food subsidies should be reduced by the end of the period. Housing subsidies will rise because of increases in the publicly owned housing stock and higheraverage loan charges. Net lending for house purchase has already been sub-stantially increased. The rise in education grants reflects the forecast growth of the student population.Total public expenditure53. To the expenditure totals given in Tables 1.2 and 1.3 and described in the preceding paragraphs, a contingency reserve has to be added to covernew developments which may arise during the Survey period. This reserve isalso intended to cover the cost of those policies which have been announced ingeneral terms but whose detailed application, and timing, have not yet been determined to the point where the annual cost can be quantified and includedin the relevant expenditure programme.54. The amount provided for the contingency reserve, expressed in demand terms, rises to  750 million in the final year of the Survey period.Further information on the contingency reserve is given on pages 125 and126 in Part 2.55.  A global deduction is also made in the light of past experience thatthe real level of total expenditure tends to fall short of the aggregate of programme totals. This deduction is also explained in greater detail at pagesto      in Part 2.56. The detailed Tables 3.1 and 3.2 on pages 138 to 141 in Part 3 bringtogether public expenditure of all kinds, including expenditure both on goods and services and on transfer payments etc. as well as the contingency reserve and the shortfall deduction. The programme figures in Table 3.1 are in volumeterms, that is to say they show the expenditure at constant 1974 Survey prices,as in Tables 1.2 and 1.3 above and in the detailed programme tables in Part 2.Such figures do not however fully reflect the cost involved, because on averagethe prices which are important for public expenditure tend to rise faster thanprices in general. It is possible, although only in a very broad way, to adjust the programme figures to take account of this &quot;relative price effect&quot;,* and thisis done in Table 3.2.* See Part 4, Section II on page 164.
57. Changes in this aggregate of public expenditure are important forthe financing requirement, which is relevant to the Governmenfs ability to.manage the public debt and to control the money supply. However, as explained in paragraph 53 above, the future level of the aggregate will also beaffected by expenditure on certain policies which at present are a potentialcharge on the contingency reserve. For the purpose of resource planning overthe next four years, the important measure is the growth in the demand which public expenditure (inclusive of the contingency reserve) is expected to make on resources.58. For this purpose, the starting point adopted was the level of expendi-ture in 1974-75 as forecast at the beginning of the expenditure review, includingthe cost of the measures which had been taken, at or around the time of the march Budget, immediately after the Governments entry into office. starting from that point, total public expenditure is planned to grow on average by\ per cent a year, in demand terms, during the remainder of the survey period. If account is also taken of subsequent developments affecting the reallevel of expenditure in 1974-75, the average annual growth rate, in demand terms, from 1974-75 to 1978-79 is estimated at about 2  per cent.59. More detailed information about individual programmes is given inPart 2 of this White Paper. Part 3 contains, in addition to the summary tablesmentioned above, a number of further special analyses by economic categoryand spending authority; and a summary of the comparison between the figures in this White Paper and those in the previous White Paper (Cmnd 5519)revalued to 1974 Survey prices.

PART public Expenditure The Individual ProgrammesINTRODUCTION1. As in previous years this part of the White Paper contains separatechapters on each of the main programmes. Each chapter starts with a tableanalysing the figures by programme and sub-programme. In some cases the presentation is assisted by diagrams, included this year for the first time, to illustrate the major components of expenditure. There is a separate chapter(Chapter 16) on the contingency reserve and the general deduction forshortfall.2. In describing the programmes account has been taken of suggestions made in the past by the Expenditure Committee for improving presentation.More non-financial information is included.3. The tables include a comparison between the figures in this white paper and those in the last White Paper (Cmnd 5519). The changes in expenditure between the two White Papers represent the differences between two sets of chosen policies. But in comparing them two points should beborne in mind. First, the status of Cmnd 5519 is uncertain because theGovernment of the time, having announced reductions for 1974-75 on theday when the White Paper was published, also said that their programmes for the later years would be reviewed, but had not carried out this reviewbefore they left office. Second, the differences between the figures in the twoWhite Papers include changes in the information on which the estimates were constructed.4. The figures in Cmnd 5519 were expressed in that White Paper as being at 1973 Survey prices. For the purpose of comparison with the figures in this white Paper the figures in Cmnd 5519 have been revalued to 1974 survey prices (see the glossary in Part 4 for a definition of &quot;revaluation&quot;).5. The summary tables analysing expenditure by main programme in costand volume terms published as Tables 2A and 2B in Cmnd 5519, are this yearincluded in the statistics in Part 3 (Tables 3.1 and 3.2).

The defence budget covers all expenditure by the Ministry ofDefence as well as expenditure by the PSA on works for defence. Sincethe last White Paper (Cmnd 5519) the financing of the Royal OrdnanceFactories (ROF&apos;s) has been transferred from Votes to a trading fund inaccordance with the Government Trading Funds Act 1973; and their capitalexpenditure (including working capital) is now no longer part of the defence budget, but is included in1 National accounts adjustments shown in Table 2.1above; figures for earlier years up to 1975-76 have been adjusted accordingly.2. The Secretary of State for Defence announced on 21 March 1974that the Government were beginning a review of current defence commit-ments and capabilities against the resources that, given the economic pros-pects of the country, could be afforded for defence. The Govern-menfs provisional conclusions following this Defence Review were announced in the House of Commons on 3 December 1974 in a further statement by the Secretary of State for Defence in which he stated thatthe Government would achieve savings as compared with previously plannedlevels of Defence expenditure of  300 millions in 1975-76 rising to  500millions in 1978-79. At the same time the Government initiated thorough-going consultations on the Defence Review with NATO and other Allies,and these are continuing. Once the consultations with the Allies have beencompleted, and the Governmenfs final decisions have been taken, a detailedaccount of the outcome of the Defence Review will be given in the 1975Statement on Defence.

The bulk of the policy changes result from the Defence Reviewitself, but also take into account the decision not to proceed with the third london Airport for which sums were previously included in the defence budget mainly to cover the cost of relocating certain facilities now atShoeburyness.5. The other changes shown under Defence Budget in the table con-sist of estimating adjustments for the years from 1975-76 onwards including a reassessment of the cost of the previously planned defence programmeespecially for 1977-78 for which the Cmnd 5519 figure was provisional.They also include extra costs for additional Service manpower, and peace-keeping operations in Northern Ireland together with adjustments conse-quent upon the abolition of the Purchasing (Repayment) Services Vote,which were foreshadowed in paragraph 4 on page 19 of Cmnd 5519 butnot provided for in the Cmnd 5519 figures:

The adjustment (line (6)) represents thedifference between the two figures.Overseas representation1. This expenditure includes the cost of the Foreign and Common-wealth, Office (FCO) in London, British diplomatic and consular representa-tion in more than 120 countries and 8 official delegations to international organisations and conferences. It covers the cost of staff (excluding those engaged on information work) as well as their office and private accommoda-tion abroad and official travel. It also includes the cost of the PassportOffices in London and other centres and the communications organisation in support of the Diplomatic Service.2. The responsibility of the Diplomatic Service for representing and promoting British interests abroad includes the handling of inter-govern-mental relations; advice on foreign policy; protecting the interests of british nationals abroad; promoting Britain&apos;s visible and invisible exports by assist-ing British commercial organisations and firms and by conducting bilateraland multilateral negotiations on international trade and payments; andrepresenting Her Majesty&apos;s Government in international organisations.3. Expenditure by the Property Services Agency (PSA) on the Diplo-matic Estate overseas accounts for about 20 per cent of this programme.The future trend of expenditure on both the Diplomatic Estate and theprogramme as a whole is relatively steady.

By comparison with Cmnd 5519 capital communications projectshave been cut from 1975-76 by about  1.3 million a year, and the over-seas accommodation building programme by about  1.1 million a year. the overseas accommodation capital programme was also reduced by about 2.2 million in 1974-75.Overseas information5.  The programme continues to cover three main elements:(i) The cost of the BBC External Services. These broadcast in english and 39 other languages for over 700 hours a week* and aim toinform the largest possible foreign audiences about Britain andthe part it plays in international trade and politics. They alsosupply pre-recorded programmes to overseas broadcasting stations,particularly in the field of English teaching. The expenditure coversoperating expenses, such as programme staff and engineering costs,and capital expenditure on relay stations and on the modernisation of the headquarters at Bush House. Much of the cost of the BBCMonitoring Service is also included under this heading.*See BBC Handbook 1974.
(ii) A proportion (now 67 per cent) of British Council expenditure to promote wider knowledge of the United Kingdom and theEnglish language abroad, and to develop close cultural relationswith other countries f. The Council is at present represented in83 overseas countries but financial cuts are leading to some re-appraisal of effort. The remainder of the Councils expenditure is included in overseas aid together with its expenditure on educa-tional activities and technical assistance schemes for the benefitof developing countries carried out on behalf of the Ministry of overseas Development.(iii) The cost of FCO information staff and operations at home andabroad and of supporting services of the Central Office of Informa-tion and the Stationery Office, plus part of external broadcastingrelay expenditure. The aim is to ensure by personal contacts, theprovision of material in all media, reference services and a pro-gramme of visits to the UK, an awareness of Britain&apos;s internationalrole and interests; to secure, by publicity abroad, unstanding of and support for the policies of Her Majesty&apos;s Government; andto achieve a favourable opinion abroad for Britain, its business andnationals.6. The approximate breakdown of recurrent costs from 1975-76 isas follows:(i) BBC External Services 38 per cent(ii) British Council (FCO share) 29 per cent(iii) FCO/COI/HMSO 33 per cent7. Capital expenditure on an agreed programme of projects accounts for about 6 per cent of the total over the period 1974-75 to 1978-79 andvaries from year to year according to project requirements.8. The general trend of expenditure from 1975-76 onwards is slightlydownwards both for the programme as a whole and for the three main elements. By comparison with Cmnd 5519 the programme has been cut by about  1  million a year from 1975-76 onwards.Other external relations9. The main items of expenditure are certain overseas service pensionsand various international commitments and subscriptions. These includepayments under a Treasury guarantee to the International Bank for Re-construction and Development (because of default on the part of theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia)*, the United kingdom&apos;s  assessed con-tributions to regular budgets of United Nations organisations and of theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Councilof Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Secretariat costs),and a grant-in-aid to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Extraprovision has been made in 1974-75 for HMG&apos;s contribution to the united nations Emergency Force in the Middle East and for the reinforcement of the UN Force in Cyprus.see British Council Annual Reports*Session 1972-73, HC.252.
Military aid10. With the virtual completion of earlier capital aid programmes, this expenditure is now confined almost entirely to military training assistance,namely courses in the United Kingdom for the Service personnel of othercountries, and the provision of British Service personnel on loan to develop-ing (mainly Commonwealth) countries. By comparison with Cmnd 5519expenditure under this heading has been reduced by about one-half from1975-76 onwards and some preliminary reductions have already been madein 1974-75. Training in the UK now accounts for the major part of theprogramme.Overseas aid11. The figures for overseas aid set out in Table 2.2 are net of amortisa-tion and at constant (1974 Survey) prices. They show that the aid pro-gramme will increase in real terms by some 14 per cent over the fouryears to 1978-79.12. During 1974, the Government accepted in principle the united nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for official development assistance.It has not been possible to set any date for reaching this target, as this must be subject to the progress of our own economy as well as to theother calls on our resources. But the upward trend in the Aid Programmeprovides an earnest of the Governmenfs intention to move towards the target as and when circumstances permit. In 1973, official developmentassistance represented 0.35 per cent of our GNP.13. The United kingdom&apos;s  share of the concessional aid* provided for developing countries through the budget of the European Economic Com-munity, including the European Development Fund, will be included withinthe Aid Programme. The biggest single item of expenditure so far hasbeen on food aid but the UK&apos;s share of the Community&apos;s contribution tothe UN emergency operation for the developing countries most seriously affected by the recent increases in oil and commodity prices could totalaround  21 million, the bulk of which is likely to be disbursed duringthe financial year 1975-76. Disbursements arising from a British contributionto the European Development Fund and other new Community aid pro-grammes are not now expected to occur before 1976-77.14. The oil and commodity price rises have hit the poorer developing countries particularly hard. For this reason, greater efforts are being madeinternationally to channel a higher proportion of the most concessional aid to them. Many of the most seriously affected countries are among those now receiving British aid and a substantial share of our aid resourcesis already going to them. It is intended that they should receive a largeproportion of the additional resources being made available for the aid programme.15. The allocations from the Aid Programme are subject to regularreview. In 1975-76, over half of the gross total is planned to go to bilateralcapital aid, about a quarter to multilateral aid and about a fifth to technical assistance. The remainder will be spent through the Commonwealth Develop-* See Part 4, Section I, page 163.
ment Corporation and on relieving overseas governments of pension liabilities-ties in respect of British expatriates.16. The largest single allocation of multilateral aid is for the Inter-national Development Association. Strong British support is given to theUnited Nations Development Programme and other UN aid and reliefagencies. Regional Development Banks are also assisted by British aidfunds. Aid given through efficient multilateral institutions provides a means of mobilising aid from other donors and so of increasing total aidflows. This was an important consideration in UK participation in theEuropean Community&apos;s offer of $500 million to the UN Emergency Fund.17. Over two-thirds of bilateral capital aid in 1973 was in the form of loans (mainly interest free), and nearly one-third in the form of grants.The United Kingdom complied in 1973 with the main objective containedin the revised Recommendation on Terms of the Development assistance committee of the OECD, which came into force in January 1973. On thebasis of the grant element which is the internationally recognised measureof concessionality, the UK attained an average grant element of 86 percent (against the target of at least 84 per cent). The special DAC target for aid to the least developed countries provides amongst other things that the average grant element of all official development assistance com-commitments from donors should be at least 86 per cent to each least developedcountry over a period of three years. This is Britain&apos;s objeotive also.18. During the five years 1969-1973,  515 million was committed toprojects; of this 32 per cent was for economic infra-structure and 24 percent for investment in social services. A large part of the aid provided in these two categories served rural development and was complementary to the 7 per cent of the total which was devoted directly to the developmentof natural resources and agriculture.19. Technical assistance helps developing countries to overcome theirshortage of skilled manpower. It includes support for the education andtraining of local people, the provision of people to do jobs for which thereare insufficient trained personnel locally, and the support of back-up services in this country, including those of Government research organisations whichare concerned with problems of importance to developing countries. Britishbilateral technical assistance in 1973 included the support in the developing countries of nearly 12,000 advisers, experts and teachers, and 2,700 volun-teers as well as the training in the United Kingdom of some 9,200 students and over 5,700 trainees.20. Detailed statistical information for the past five years is availablein the HMSO publication &quot;British Aid Statistics&apos;, and an account of theBritish Aid Programme as provided to the Development Assistance Com-mittee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development isto be published as a White Paper.
Overseas aid administration21. This covers the administrative expenses of the Ministry of Over-seas Development. In addition to the headquarters in London the ODMmaintains five Development Divisions overseas, in the Caribbean (Bridge-town), Middle East (Beirut), South East Asia (Bangkok), East Africa(Nairobi) and Southern Africa (Blantyre). The cost covers staff, accommoda-tion and official travel both at home and overseas.Contributions to the European Communities, etc (net)22. The figures in this line in table 2.2 above are made up of twoelements. First, the United Kingdom&apos;s payments to the budget of theEuropean Communities, but excluding the UK share of Community ex-penditure programmes which are included in other functional programmes;second, certain contributions to the European Investment Bank and to theEuropean Coal and Steel Community. The full totals of the United King-dom&apos;s payments to the Community budget are set out in the tables inparagraph 25 below.23. The United Kingdom&apos;s payments to the Communities&apos; budget are based on the terms of the Treaty of Accession. This provides that theUnited Kingdom&apos;s contribution should rise in steps from 8.78 per cent of the 1973 budget to 19.24 per cent of the 1977 budget. Under the pro-visions of Article 131(la) of the Treaty of Accession, the United Kingdom&apos;contribution to the 1978 and 1979 budgets would depend in part on theamount of &quot;own resources&quot; collected in the United Kingdom in 1977. Forthe purpose of these forecasts it has been assumed that under the presentbudgetary arrangements the United Kingdom&apos;s percentage share of thebudgets for 1978 and 1979 would be in the order of 21 to 23 per cent.24. Following the conventions used elsewhere in this White Paper, theestimates take account only of expenditure on policies which have alreadybeen agreed. They thus exclude any allowance for policies still under dis-cussion in the Council of Ministers. They include an allowance for theUnited Kingdom&apos;s net receipts from the Regional Development Fund, agree-ment in principle on which was reached at the Paris Heads of Govern-rhent meeting on 10 December 1974. The estimates are based on the presentbudgetary arrangements, the impact of which, following the statements onRenegotiation made by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to theCouncil of Ministers on 1 April and 4 June and the agreement amongHeads of Government on 10 December, are currently under discussion inthe Council of Ministers. The estimates use the present unit of accountconversion rates; in the case of the budget unit of account  1 equals 2.4units of account.
25. The latest estimates for the calendar years to 1979 for the UnitedKingdom&apos;s contribution to, and receipts from, the Community budget areas follows:  million	Gross Contribution	Receipts	Net Contribution1973	181	77	1041974	180	150	301975	280	180	1001976	370	205	1651977	450	230	2201978	505	240	265..    1979	515	240	310In financial years to 1978-79, the figures are						  million	Gross Contribution	Receipts	Net Contribution1973-74	200	104	961974-75	205	170	35   ,1975-76	300	170	1301976-77	390	210	1801977-78	460	230	2301978-79	515	240	275(All the figures in this paragraph are at 1974 survey prices except those for1973-74 and 1973 which are at outturn prices. The figures for 1974 and1974-75 reflect some technical adjustments to the UK contribution in 1974.)26. The budget of the European Communities provides the finance forthe four Community Institutions, the Council of Ministers, the Court ofJustice, the Commission and the European Assembly. The expenditure ofthe Council, Assembly and Court of Justice is almost entirely for theadministrative and running expenses of these three Institutions. The mainCommunity policies (eg the Common Agricultural Policy, the Social Fund,aid) are financed from the Commission^ expenditure which accounts forsome 98 per cent of the provisions in the 1975 Community budget.27. A range of expenditure programmes is financed from the Com-munity budget. About three quarters of the expenditure provided for inthe 1975 Community budget is for agricultural support and modernisationunder the Common Agricultural Policy, some 6 per cent is for the EuropeanSocial Fund which provides support for schemes for training, rehabilitatingand redeploying labour and 4 per cent for aid, mainly in the form of food aid, for developing countries. The remainder of the 1975 budget includes provision for the refunds to member states for the cost of collecting &quot;own resources&quot; (ie customs duties and agricultural levies) from which the Com-munity budget is in part financed, for various statistical and other studies,for the salaries and administrative expenses of the four Community in-institutions, for research in nuclear and other fields and for the Europeanschools, which provide for the education of children of employees of theEuropean Community Institutions.
28. The figures in the final column of the second table in paragraph 25above differ from those in table 2.2 for two main reasons. The figures in table 2.2 exclude the UK share of Community budget expenditure pro-grammes, mainly aid, which are included in other functional programmes.The figures in table 2.2 include the once-for-all contributions to the Euro-pean Investment Bank and to the European Coal and Steel Community.The payments to the European Investment Bank are, first, the paid upsubscriptions to the capital of the Bank amounting to  37.5 million duringthe first 2\ years of membership; and second, a contribution to the reserves of the Bank, amounting to approximately  20 million payable over the sameperiod. Four of the five instalments of these contributions have been paidso far. The investment in the reserve funds of the European Coal and steel community is about  24 million paid in three equal annual instalments.(The sums mentioned in this paragraph are all at current prices.)Sterling area guarantees29. Compensation of some  59 million was paid in respect of the sterling Agreements which expired in September 1973. Compensation pay-able under the six-month unilateral guarantee for the period to March1974 totalled some  80 million.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE30. There was no provision in Cmnd 5519 for payments in respectof the extension of the sterling guarantees announced in September 1973.The other changes are mainly the result of estimating changes. provision is now made for special assistance to the Crown Agents.

Receipts from this source are included inTable 2.2: Overseas Services.1. The quinquennium covered by this Survey continues to containelements of both the old system of agricultural support in the UnitedKingdom and the new system under the Common Agricultural Policy(CAP) of the e.c.. Since Cmnd 5519 there have been a number of special measures designed to meet difficulties in the livestock sector and a majorprogramme of food subsidies has been established. Particulars of these changes appear in the relevant paragraphs below.2. Expenditure in Northern Ireland under the price guarantees for cereals, fatstock and potatoes and on production grants and subsidies,support for capital and other improvements and for agriculture in specialareas is now included in Table 15, Northern Ireland.Market regulation under the CAP3. Expenditure under this heading relates to the UK cost of payments made by the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce in implementing the Guarantee Section aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy andthe Food Aid Programme of the e.c.. Most of this expenditure is financed by advances from the appropriate headings of the e.c. Budget the Euro-pean Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and Title 9relating to food aid. The costs of storage and financing of interventionstocks and any losses on sales are met from EAGGF and all receipts fromthe Community budget are shown under Table 2.2. The forecast for 1974-75

It also includes the variable premium scheme for beef ( 15 million), the whole; of whichis financed by the Exchequer. Apart from this, the slowly rising trend,of expenditure over later years reflects the fact that, as the United Kingdomadjusts to Community support levels through the transitional period, refundson exports to third countries are likely to increase.Price guarantees4. The Treaty of Accession provides for the United Kingdom deficiency round for those products supported by the CAP to be ended by 1978. Asindicated in Cmnd 5519, the guarantees which were given under the Agri-culture Act 1957 on beef, rye, eggs and sugar beet have been discontinued.The cost of implementing the milk guarantee is treated as a consumersubsidy and is accordingly shown in the table under &quot;food subsidies&quot;. Forthe remaining CAP products (cereals and fat pigs) market prices continue tobe above the guaranteed price levels and the estimates for 1974-75 made no provision for deficiency payments. The 1975-76 estimate makes provisionfor the possibility of deficiency payments on the 1975 cereals crop and onfat pigs. Because of the difficulty of predicting the future level of world market prices, the forecasts for later guarantee years are based convention-ally on minimum price levels under the CAP support system-itself under
review with the level of deficiency payments reducing over the periodof transition to the full level of e.c. support.5. A continuation of deficiency payments has been assumed for other products potatoes, wool and sheep to which the CAP does not apply. Thelow figures for 1973-74 and 1974-75 take account of the high market prices for wool from the 1972 and 1973 clips and the recovery of past deficiency round.Production grants and subsidies, capital grants and support in special areas6. The Government has reintroduced the lime subsidy and has taken a number of steps to meet the special problems encountered in the live-stock seotor. An increase of  10 a head in the rates of calf subsidy was introduced for a limited period from July 1974, and a special pig subsidywas paid from 25 March to 3 November 1974. In October the government announced an increase in hill sheep subsidy rates from December 1974and that payments in respect of claims for the hill cattle and beefcow subsidies for 1975 and subsequent years would be brought forward for payment early each year.7. The estimates also reflect the short-term subsidy for oil used in horticulture-culture. The figures for support in special areas now include an attributionof the additional benefits which farmers in hill areas receive under the farm Capital Grant Scheme.Relationship of expenditure on agricultural support to policy objectives8. The economic conditions and prospects of agriculture in the UnitedKingdom are reviewed each year and the Governmenfs conclusions are published in the Annual Review White Paper. The most recent of theseWhite Papers was published in March 1974, Cmnd 5565. A great dealof supporting information about the industry is contained in the statisticaltables appended to the White Papers. This information, which relatesmainly to the most recent 5 years, provides a detailed analysis of the current situation including individual commodity trends, and developments in farmstructure, efficiency and labour productivity, net farm income, and so on.9. The Annual Review does not however attempt to make preciseforecasts for the future of agricultural production, resource use, and anyassociated public expenditure in support of agriculture. Nor are the ob-jectives of agricultural support policy defined in terms of specific levels of output. The future level of production depends on decisions on support and on factors which cannot be reliably predicted, such as the weather,world supply and demand for agricultural products and developments in agricultural technology. The large movements in world cereal prices between1972 and 1973 illustrate the difficulties of prediction.Other assistance to agricultural production, food processing and marketing10. The figures include continuing expenditure by the agricultural departments on agricultural research, advisory services, the eradication andcontrol of animal disease, etc. The gallonage premiums for milk frombrucellosis-free herds (which had previously been recouped from the revenues from the sales of liquid milk) are now charged to this programme.
Expenditure cuts for the financial year 1974-75 included a .reduction inthe amount of work commissioned from Research Councils and in theprogramme for the improvement of wholesale horticultural markets. Follow-ing these changes the present Government has decided to resume thegrowth rate originally planned for expenditure on commissioned researchbut starting from a new lower level.11. The figure for 1974-75 also includes  45 million in respect of commonwealth sugar arrangements, including supplementary payments under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, and  150 million in respect of temporary advances to assist sugar refiners with bridging finance for ex-exceptional transactions to ensure supplies, provision for repayments being included in the 1975-76 figure. About  3 million is included for controlmeasures for swine vesicular disease.Covent Garden Market Authority12. The new Covent Garden Market at Nine Elms opened in November1974. The figures relate to capital expenditure on the final stages of con-struction and estimated receipts from the sale of land at the site of theold market.Central and miscellaneous services13. Central services include the main expenditure by the agricultural departments on staff costs and administration of the agricultural pro-grammes and by the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food on theadministration of food subsidies. They do not include the agricultural development and Advisory Service (attributed to &quot;Other assistance to agri-cultural production&quot;).14. Central services also comprise expenditure by the InterventionBoard on staff and administrative costs. The forecasts are framed to&apos;keep pace with expected increases in the Board&apos;s operations in the transitional period. &apos;    .15. Miscellaneous services include the staff costs and maintenance ofthe Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, Wakehurst Place and Edinburgh, ex-penditure on land management and smallholdings, assistance to crofters inScotland, publicity and miscellaneous grants etc including payments to international organisations.Fisheries16. The main expenditure under this heading consists of grants and loans for new vessels and equipment and grants for the improvement, ofharbours, in the interests of promoting a stable fishing industry in. theUnited Kingdom. Additional support is provided by way of research anddevelopment, fishing protection in Scottish waters and support, for trawleroperations under the current agreement with IcelandRelationship of expenditure on fisheries to policy objectives17, The objective of this programme is to ensure a stable supply of fishfor the consumer. It aims to promote the fishing industry in the UnitedKingdom and to reduce the nation&apos;s dependence on imports; The UK&apos;s
access to distant fisheries grounds may be changed by the outcome ofthe United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The e.c. is alsodeveloping a common fisheries policy. The structure of the UK fishingfleet is changing to meet the new situations.18. UK landings of fresh and frozen fish (including shellfish) in 1972and 1973 were between 900,000 and 1 million tons. They accounted forbetween 85 and 90 per cent of total supplies, excluding canned fish. the fishing fleet provides direct employment for about 20,000 people full timeand just over 4,000 part time. In each case about half are employedin England and Wales and half in Scotland. About five times the numberare engaged in ancillary and supporting activities. There were just over,500 vessels fishing regularly during 1973 of which over 3,500 worked fromports in England and Wales and over 2,500 from Scottish ports.Forestry19. This item covers the Forestry Commission^ activities in promoting the interests of forestry, the establishment and maintenance of adequate reserves of growing trees and the production and supply of timber. TheCommission^ activities divide between the Forestry Enterprise (a Govern-ment Trading Service) and the Forestry Authority. The forecasts includeinterest on capital (increasing from  24.9 million to  28.0 million) and depreciation.20. The Commission^ accounts were reconstructed at 1 April 1972to bring out its subsequent performance in relation to a target rate of return of 3 per cent in real terms on its notional capital. Separate subsidiesare assessed for (i) the difference between 3 per cent and the ruling rate ofinterest (ii) new planting and restocking undertaken for social reasons which could not earn the target rate of return and (iii) non-commercialamenity and recreational aspects. During the quinquennium, the accountswill compare the costs incurred and the receipts from sales with the Corn-mission^ standards and will assess the divergences. A quinquennial revalua-tion of the growing stock will provide the basis for an appraisal of whetherthe target rate has been achieved over the period.21. The Forestry Enterprise is carrying out a combined planting andrestocking programme of up to 22,000 hectares a year. The size of the forest estate will increase from about 790,000 hectares to about 880,000hectares at the end of the quinquennium with a plantable reserve of about80,000 hectares. Approximately 850 kilometres of new roads will be con-structed and about 9.8 million cubic metres of timber harvested. TheCommission provide substantial recreational facilities in their forests. Itis planned to provide 12 camping sites (on a commercial basis) during the quinquennium, 4 major and 21 minor information centres and 96 picnicplaces and viewpoints with associated parking facilities, forest walks and nature trails.22. As the Forestry Authority, the Commission undertakes research into all branches of forestry, controls felling in private woodlands and pro-vides grants and technical advice to private woodland owners. A new grant-aid scheme was introduced on 1 October 1974 whereby the commission will pay grants for approved planting of timber-producing species in re-
turn for the owner accepting certain obligations in respect of the manage-ment of the woodlands designed to secure sound forestry practice, goodland use, environmental benefits and opportunities for recreation. Privateplanting under previous grant schemes, now closed to further applications,has been about 23,000 hectares a year for the last few years.Food subsidies23. Under Section 1 of the Prices Act 1974 the Government have introrduced a programme of consumer subsidies in order to hold down the pricesof certain basic foodstuffs in the United Kingdom. Subsidies are currently being paid on bread, butter, cheese, household flour, milk and tea.24. It has been assumed in the Survey that the subsidy programme willbe held broadly at its existing level in 1975-76 and that it will be progressively reduced during the remainder of this Survey period.25. As a result of the subsidies introduced so far, the Food Index isestimated to be 6 points below what it would otherwise have been and the saving on the Retail Price Index is estimated to be about \\ per cent. Onthe basis of the National Food Survey for the second quarter of 1974 the saving for a typical family of two adults and two children is about 85pper week; the saving for a pensioner couple is over 45p per week.26. The Exchequer contribution towards the general butter subsidy( 46 million in 1974-75) is borne on the vote of the Department of prices and Consumer Protection but, together with the contribution from theGuarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and guarantee fund (EAGGF) ( 10.3 million), is paid by the Intervention Board. Thecost of the social beef subsidy ( 15 million in 1974-75 and  13 million in1975-76), administered by the Department of Health and Social security and the Department of Health and Social Services for Northern ireland on behalf of the Intervention Board, is borne on the vote of the InterventionBoard. The Guarantee Section of the EAGGF will finance 41 per cent ofthe cost ( 6 million in 1974-75 and  5.3 million in 1975-76).CHANGES IN EXPENDITUREMarket regulation and price guarantees27. In the case of market regulation under the CAP, the out-turnfor 1973-74 was less than forecast, mainly because the support buying of commodities did not reach the volume expected and Food Aid activities didnot arise. The changes from 1974-75 onwards reflect a reduced level ofexpenditure in these areas; this is offset in 1974-75 by the introduction ofthe beef premium scheme, the variable premium scheme for beef, and bythe inclusion for the subsequent four years also of the payment of import and export refunds on Intra-Community trade (monetary compensatoryamounts). The revision of the forecasts for price guarantee in 1974-75 and1975-76 results in reductions of  52 million and  37 million respectivelycompared with Cmnd 5519. Increases in the forecasts for later years follow from the conventional approach to the prediction of future market prices.Production grants and subsidies, capital grants and support in special areas28.  As compared with Cmnd 5519, the projections show increases of
 84 million in 1974-75,  45 million in 1975-76 and about  16 million in later years. The main reasons for these increases are described in paragraphs and 7 above.Other changes29. A major change is the provision for expenditure on food subsidiesintroduced during 1974 (see paragraphs 23 to 26 above). Other major changes are in respect of Commonwealth sugar arrangements, temporary bridgingfinance to sugar refiners and the additional commitment for brucellosis milkpremiums (referred to in paragraphs 10 and 11).

Section 7 of that Act provides a flexible scheme of selective assistance by means of loans and grants, replacing that previouslyprovided under the Local Employment Act 1972. The regional employment premium has been continued and the rates of payment have been doubled.The provision of factories under the Local Employment Act 1972 con-tinues as does the use of Industrial Development Certificates to encourage the location of new or expanding industrial activities in the assisted areas.Regional development grants2. Regional development grants under Part 1 of the Industry Act1972 are made towards the cost of buildings and plant and machineryat the rate of 22 per cent in the special development areas and 20 per centin development areas. Grants are also made at 20 per cent towards thecost of buildings in the enlarged intermediate areas and in the case of a building or of any works provided before 22 March 1974 in the derelict landclearance areas. The forecasts include a provision for the extension of the assisted areas announced in August 1974 but assume that the rates of grants will remain unchanged throughout the period. The forecasts reflect the uptake of grant so far and are lower than those in Cmnd 5519.Provision of land and buildings3. The forecasts make provision for existing policies for land purchase and factory building; they include part of the special programme to assistthe construction industry in 1975-76 announced on 11 September 1974.Selective assistance to industry in the assisted areas4. Assistance under Section 7 of the Industry Act 1972 is available on a selective basis to industry in the development and intermediate areas to supplement the basic regional incentives of for example regional develop-ntent grants and regional employment premiums. This assistance includes,for projects which provide additional employment, loans at favourablerates, or as an alternative, interest relief grants towards the cost of financeobtained from commercial sources. For projects of modernisation or

Removal grants are also available where a firm is moving into an assisted area. The forecasts arehigher than those in Cmnd 5519 owing to the inclusion of separate pro-vision for assistance to the shipbuilding industry.Regional employment premium5. Provision is made for the continued payment of the premium, as announced in the Budget in March, 1974, in respect of manufacturingestablishments in development areas. The boundaries of these areas havebeen extended from 14 August 1974 so that additional establishments areeligible for the premium. The rates of premium were doubled as from 5August 1974.Other regional support6. This heading includes expenditure by the Development Fund andby the Highlands and Islands Development Board.Residual expenditure under repealed sections of the local employment Act 19727. The forecasts for building grants and grants under Section 4 are lower than those in Cmnd 5519 and it is expected that all payments underthe repealed sections of the Local Employment Act 1972 will be com-pleted during 1976-77. Repayment of loans will, however, continue for someyears to come.Industrial innovationGeneral industrial research and development8. This heading includes the Department of Industry^ Industrial Re-seafch Establishments and Computer Aided Design Centre, contract andgrant support for industrial research associations and the National research and Development Corporation and certain extramural research and develop-ment and other support. A major part of the expenditure falls within theresponsibility of the Requirements Boards set up in accordance with thePolicy set out in &quot;Framework for Government Research and Development&quot;(Cmnd 5046).
9. In addition to their work for the Requirements Boards, the industrial research Establishments undertake work for Government Departments,for other public authorities and for industry. They include three multi-purpose establishments (National Physical Laboratory, National Engineer-ing Laboratory and Warren Spring Laboratory) and a more specialisedestablishment, the Laboratory of the Government Chemist. The presentfigures show research effort continuing at the level previously forecast in cmnd 5519 except in 1975-76 where there is a small reduction.10. Extramural support by the Department of Industry includes workon materials, marine technology, special assistance to the hovercraft in-dustry and the grant-in-aid to the Design Council. Expenditure on special assistance to the hovercraft industry is expected to cease after 1975-76 andis currently showing an estimating reduction against Cmnd 5519. Overall theextramural expenditure is increased against Cmnd 5519. This reflects thepreference of the Requirements Boards for extramural rather than intra-mural research and includes increased support for industrial research associa-tions, where the method of funding is being changed from grants to con-tract support; the changeover should be virtually completed by 1975-76.11. The Department of Energy&apos;s expenditure on offshore technologycovers offshore geological studies, work to support the Departments statu-tory responsibilities for safety of offshore installations and research anddevelopment to promote the competitiveness of British firms supplyinggoods and services for offshore oil and gas operations. A rise in expenditure is expected as the oil and gas fields on the UK Continental Shelf are broughton stream. Work is also being carried out by the Energy TechnologySupport unit at the Atomic Energp Research Establishment, Harwell forthe Department of Energy to assess the possibilities of unexploited sources of energy, ie solar, wind, or geothermal energy, and on energy conservationpossibilities.Technological and industrial sponsorship12. This programme is administered by the Department of Industry.Measures of support available to industry include cost-sharing research and development contracts, pre-production purchases of advanced machin-ery and equipment, and grants to the National Computing Centre. Assist-ance is also given to mineral exploration, under the Mineral Explorationand Investment Grants Act 1972.Aircraft and aeroengine projects and assistance13. The Government have announced their intention to take the air-craft industry into public ownership. Therefore, subject to the passageof the necessary legislation, they will be concerned with the finance re-quired by the new nationalised industry, to carry on its business not only,as at present, with the Government contribution to specific projects. Thisis already the position with Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited which is publicly owned. Details of current Government support are given in the following paragraphs.Aircraft and aeroengine general research and development14. The object of this programme is to assist the civil aircraft industryto maintain its commercial competitiveness. Provision is made for research
and experimental development in the fields of airframes, aero engines and aircraft equipment; this includes work on the reduction of aircraft noise andof pollution from engine exhaust emissions. Industry, universities and government aircraft R&amp;D establishments are involved. The expenditureshows a substantial reduction compared with Cmnd 5519.Concorde15. The estimates provide for the United Kingdom share of a) the costs of development work to a standard capable of meeting the productionspecification for Concorde and of obtaining a Certificate of Airworthiness,and b) for the costs, net of sales receipts, of the production and support ofthe authorised programme of 16 aircraft. The estimates show some reduc-tion, both development and on production expenditure, compared withCmnd 5519.RB21116. The estimates provide for the completion of the agreed programmeof development of the RB211-22 and production of the first 555 engines.Compared with Cmnd 5519 provision is now made for a government contribution towards the cost of repairs carried out under guarantee toengines in airline service. These payments fall mainly in 1974-75. receipts from sales are expected to exceed production expenditure in each year forthe remainder of the 555 engine programme and the total cost of the project is expected to remain within the estimate given in the White paper on Rolls-Royce Limited and the RB211 Aero-Engine (Cmnd 4860). Theestimates include Government support for the launch costs of the RB211-524 for the Lockheed TriStar L 1011-200.Other aircraft and aeroengine projects and assistance17. Provision is made for support of the HS 146 aircraft on the basisannounced by the Secretary of State for Industry in the House of commons on 9 December 1974 and for support of the M45H engine. The estimatesalso take into account receipts of levies on sales of civil aircraft and engines(and spares) that were developed with Government support; and includepayment to the Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence forheadquarters services on behalf of the Department of Industry. No pro-vision is made for unapproved aircraft or aeroengine projects.Space18. Provision is made for the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution towardsthe European Space Research Organisation^ applications satellite pro-grammes including the additional space programmes agreed at the european space Conference in July 1973 and the cost of the work to be undertaken in connection with the bilateral agreement with the French Governmentconcerning the Ariane Launcher. Provision is also made for a small associated -ated programme of national research and development work.Nuclear energy19. As in previous years the greater part of the forecast expenditure under this heading is in respect of research and development by the atomic energy Authority. Provision is also made for continuing support for theinternational centrifuge project for enriching uranium, for providing further capital for British Nuclear Fuels Limited and the Radiochemical CentreLimited and for other miscellaneous nuclear services.
20. Expenditure on power reactor research and development over thefive years to 1978-79 is estimated at  244 million, with expenditure peak-ing to  59 million in 1976-77. The major part of this expenditure is for continuing development of the sodium cooled fast reactor. Provision how-ever, is also made for a start on the further development of thermalreactors, in particular the Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor(SGHWR).General support for industrySelective assistance to individual industries firms and undertakings21. This heading covers assistance under Section 8 of the industry act 1972, together with the  40 million assistance to International Com-puters (Holdings) Ltd (ICL) which is being given under the Science and technology Act 1965, during the period 1972-73 to 1976-77. The forecasts for 1978-79 include provision for initial repayments by ICL.-22. Section 8 of the Industry Act 1972, gives general powers for financial assistance to industry where it is in the national interest, likelyto benefit the economy, and cannot appropriately be provided in any other way. The provision by the Department of Industry under Section 8 of theIndustry Act includes assistance to the Wool Textile Industry of  15 million during the period 1974-75 to 1977-78. Provision has only been made forprojects which have been approved. Additional projects are a call on the contingency reserve. In a number of special cases, short-term guaranteeshave been given to major companies in financial difficulties such as british leyland Motor Corporation, Ferranti Ltd. and Alfred Herbert Ltd., while their longer-term position is under study.23. All the Department of Energy&apos;s expected expenditure under Section8 of the Industry Act 1972 is in support of companies involved in supplyinggoods and services for offshore oil and gas operations. The Offshore SuppliesInterest Relief Grant Scheme was announced on 6 November 1973 and is designed to reduce the cost of borrowing to finance contracts for the supplyof UK goods and services for fixed installations on the UK continental shelf. These contracts are not eligible for facilities provided by the ExportCredit Guarantee Department, although supplies from overseas countriesqualify for assistance under their national export credit schemes. grants of 3 per cent a year are payable on qualifying borrowing for up to 8 years.Promotion of tourism24. This heading includes grants-in-aid to the British Tourist authority and the English, Scottish and Wales Tourist Boards; expenditure on touristprojects in the development areas under Section 4 of the Development of tourism Act 1969; and, up to 1975-76, provision for assistance to&apos;the hotel industry under Part II of that Act. More detailed information aboutthe expenditure of the statutory tourist organisations may be found in their annual reports. The new policy guide lines for tourism announced inNovember 1974 are intended to shift resources from the generalised pro-motion of tourism, towards the development of tourism in areas of un-tapped potential, particularly in development areas. The financial implications-tions of these changes are being considered but cannot be reflected in the forecasts at this stage. &apos;
Refinancing of home shipbuilding lending25. The Department of Industry refinances a proportion of the creditprovided by the clearing banks. See paragraph 40 below for more details.The figures for 1974-75 and 1975-76 include provision for taking over theremainder of a block of refinancing provided by the Issue Department ofthe Bank of England under previous arrangements.Assistance to the shipbuilding industry26. This heading includes special assistance to Govan ShipbuildersLimited and to Cammell Laird Shipbuilders Limited. The forecasts also include provision for construction grants on a tapering scale under Section11 of the Industry Act 1972 together with repayments of loans made underthe Shipbuilding Credit Act 1964, and the Shipbuilding Industry Act 1967.Assistance to the shipbuilding industry is also provided under the general programme of support for industry in the assisted areas (see paragraph above).Other support services27. The Secretary of State for Energy announced on 12 August 1974that money will be spent on developing sites suitable for building concreteplatforms required for the extraction of oil from the North Sea. Theexpenditure shown allows for initial site development work which is needed to meet the target of 1977 float-out for the platforms. It is intended thatthe constructors should be charged for the use of such Government ownedfacilities on a commercial basis.28. The Anglo-Iranian Oil/Commodities deal was signed in the winter of 1973-74 when the oil crisis was at its height. The Government con-tracted to buy 5 million tons of Iranian crude. In return the Iranians agreedto buy  100 million worth of British goods. The overall cost of the crudeincluding transportation, refining and distribution will be approximately 123 million. Some of the oil is being supplied to other Government depart-ments and some to the companies supplying the goods to Iran. The re-mainder is being disposed of by commercial tender. The Government ex-pects fully to recover its costs.29. Other items included are receipts from the realisation of assets of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation, miscellaneous loan repay-ments, accelerated expenditure on machine tools and the Industrial Invest-ment Scheme for assistance to the aluminium industry. Provision is madefor advances of loan capital to the National Film Finance Corporation.Investment grants30. Provision is made for residual expenditure on investment grantsarising from contracts entered into by industry before 27 October 1970.Expenditure for the period 1974-75 onwards is now expected to be higherthan was assumed in Cmnd 5519.Other information31. The Annual Report on the Industry Act 1972, contains a more detailed breakdown of expenditure under this Act and on regional assistancegenerally, together with further background material.41.........: M &apos;; -   \
Support for nationalised industries (other than the transport industries)Compensation for price restraint32. Under the Statutory Corporations (Financial Provisions) Act 1974the Government pays compensation to the Post Office and to the gas and electricity industries to offset deficits on their current account which result from their holding down their prices in accordance with price restraintpolicy. The figure for 1974-75 is expected to be about  550 million at1974 survey prices.33. In his Budget statement on 12 November, the Chancellor of theExchequer said that it was the Governments objective to phase out thesesubsidies completely. Pending a decision on how quickly this objective is to be achieved it is impossible to make an estimate of the sums whichwill be required after 1974-75 and the figure of  250 million which isshown for 1975-76 is, therefore, highly tentative. The Government intends to seek further powers to make payments after the current year.Assistance to the Coal Industry34. All the assistance to the Coal Industry shown in Cmnd 5519 was covered by the Coal Industry Acts of 1967 and 1973. Since Cmnd 5519 was published there have been a number of developments that have made itnecessary to provide further assistance outside the scope of the latter Act.Some of this is still subject to Parliamentary approval.35. Following the Governments endorsement of the Board&apos;s &quot;plan for Coal&quot; as a general strategy for the industry (see Chapter 5, para-graph 6), the National Coal Board are planning to maintain output overthe next 10 years of at least 120 million tons per annum. There will how-ever continue to be closures as reserves are exhausted. A significant partof the forecast expenditure under existing legislation relates to the financing of a special scheme for payments to redundant miners, and helping theCoal Board with other social costs arising from closures. The followingtable shows employment and output figures from 1969-70:Average manpower NCB deepat Collieries mined outputYear                                                             (thousands) (million tons)1969-70      .....................      305-1 139-81970-71       ..................    .....    287-2 133-31971-72      ......      ...............      281-5 109-2*1972-73       ...............      ......      268-0 127-01973-74      ...      ...................      252-0 97-1** Affected by industrial action.Expenditure provision under the 1973 Act also covers contributions towardsthe cost of improved pensions for mineworkers as already agreed, and regional grants payable in 1974-75. The position in 1975-76 and later de-pends on decisions yet to be taken about the phasing-out of subsidies tothe nationalised energy industries. Meanwhile a provisional figure of  50million has been shown for 1975-76.36. The NCB made a loss in 1973-74 because of industrial action. TheGovernment is paying a special grant of  128.5 million to make this good;
37. In the Final Report of the Coal Industry Examination, the Govern-ment promised to assist in meeting the existing deficiency in the miners&apos;pension fund. The amount and form of this assistance is still under con-sideration. Provision is made under the heading of &quot;assistance to the coalindustry&quot; in Table 2.4. The Report also indicated that the Government,subject to Parliamentary approval, would be making arrangements to con-tribute towards relieving the Board&apos;s finances of the costs of their pneumo-coniosis compensation scheme in respect of existing sufferers. This item isshown separately in Table 2.4. Parliamentary approval for these expendi-tures will be sought in due course.Other Compensation38. The Department of Energy pays compensation to the electricity boards in Great Britain and to the British Gas Corporation under the1972 scheme for the acceleration of capital investment to maintain em-ployment. This heading also covers payments by the Department of industry under the scheme for re-adaptation assistance to steelworkers made re-dundant with effect from January 1973. Up to half of the cost will bere-imbursed from the e.c. budget. These receipts will be credited to theForeign and Commonwealth Office under Programme 2.International tradeExport promotion and trade co-operation39. This covers the Export promotion programme, directed by theBritish Overseas Trade Board, and subscriptions to international trade organisations. The current and forecast level of expenditure reflects the improved export promotion measures established by the British OverseasTrade Board and the response of industry to the assistance offered. about two-thirds of expenditure under this programme represents assistance toBritish firms exhibiting at overseas trade fairs.Refinancing of fixed rate export credits   \40. The Export Credits Guarantee Department refinances a propor-tion of the credit provided by the clearing banks for periods of 2 years or more, the proportion depending on the level of their current accountdeposits. A similar arrangement exists for shipbuilding (see paragraph 25above). The figures are higher than those in Cmnd 5519 because they are based on more recent forecasts of current account deposits and the volumeof credit outstanding. The figure for 1975-76 includes provision for taking over the remainder of a block of refinancing provided by the Issue Depart-ment of the Bank of England under previous arrangements.Regulation of domestic trade and industry and consumer protection41. Provision is made for expenditure by the Department of trade for the Patent Office and associated international subscriptions and for theDepartment^ Insurance and Companies Divisions and the Insolvency Serv-ice. Provision is also made under this programme for expenditure by theDepartment of Prices and Consumer Protection on the Monopolies andMergers Commission, on the National Council of Social Service, on in-creased activity by Local Advisory Centres and other services for theprotection of the consumer, and on standards and quality assurance. Thelast includes the grant-in-aid to the British Standards Institution and the
cost of the Metrication Board. In the case of the Patent Office, CompaniesRegistration Office and the Insolvency Service statutory fees are leviedtowards the costs of the services provided.Functioning of the labour market42. This programme aims to improve the functioning of the labour market through the services provided by the Department of employment and the Manpower Services Commission. The expenditure of the Com-mission and its executive arms, the Employment Service Agency andTraining Services Agency, is financed by grant-in-aid and included in theprovision for this programme. Also included is expenditure by the Depart-ment of the Environment on Jobcentres and Skillcentres and by localauthorities on the Careers Service.43. Certain of the schemes for training, employment transfer and rehabilitation of the handicapped (paragraphs 45, 48 and 49 below) areeligible for assistance from the European Social Fund. Such receipts are taken into account in the net contribution to the e.c. etc (Table 2.2).Employment services and industrial rehabilitation44. The main expenditure under this heading is on the various labour market services of the Employment Service Agency (ESA). When the ESAbecame a statutory body on 1 October 1974 it published details of the plans and programmes which it had put to the Manpower Services Commission(MSC). These plans emphasised the need to provide a generally more satisfactory service to the labour market and to employers and job-seekers;for this purpose it was essential that the ESA should be able to attract alarger share of vacancies and job-seekers, and widen the range ofoccupations it serves. The establishment of new Jobceritres in place ofthe traditional Employment Exchanges is expected to make a major con-tribution towards meeting this need. The programme for opening moresuch centres is to continue at about 100 a year up to 1980. The quality ofthe service is also to be raised by increasing the degree of professionalism ofemployment advisers, by appropriate specialisation and by improved organ-isation. The Professional and Executive Recruitment (PER) aims to achievefinancial self-sufficiency in the forecast period.45. The following table gives rounded figures for past years andprojected figures for future years of vacancies notified, registrations andplacings. Year-to-year results are significantly affected by changes in labour market conditions; the figures for future years cannot, of course take account of these variations. The projections are therefore based on a steadyimprovement in results which is expected to stem from the planned develop-ment of ESA services.

In accordance with the Employment and Training Act 1973responsibility for providing the Careers Service (formerly the YouthEmployment Service) passed to local authorities in England and Walesfrom 1 April 1974 and the method of financing was changed accordingly.Similar change is planned in Scotland from 16 May 1975. The expenditure forecasts take account of both the increased scope and coverage of theService and offsetting savings from the transfer of certain work to theDepartment.47. Provision is made for the salaries and administrative expenses ofthe Manpower Services Commission.48. Within the employment services there are specialised placingservices for disabled persons together with facilities in various types ofIndustrial Rehabilitation Units for rehabilitating about 14,000 persons ayear.Industrial training49. The Training Services Agency is now responsible for carrying outthe policy of expanding industrial training, mainly through the TrainingOpportunities Scheme. The training of adults is provided in Skillcentres,colleges of further education, employers&apos; establishments, residential collegesfor the disabled and other institutions. The average period of courses inSkillcentres is about 28 weeks although the majority of courses are slightlyshorter. The average length of courses in colleges of further educationextends over two terms, 28 weeks; in employers&apos; establishments it is 12weeks. The directions in which the TSA intends to expand its programmes were indicated in a five-year plan published in May 1974.

From April 1975 there is provision for funding the administrative expenses of Industrial Training Boards, and the cost of certain key trainingactivities together with the cost of providing training services to sectors ofemployment not covered by Industrial Training Boards.Redundancy Fund payments51. In 1973-74 the number of people in respect of whom statutorypayments were made out of the Redundancy Fund was 157,000. Thiswas much lower than in any other recent year and compares with 242,000,280,000, 388,000 and 262,000 in the years 1969-70 to 1972-73. The presentprovision allows for the number to return to around the level anticipated in Cmnd 5519.Industrial relations and other labour market services52. This grouping consists of the cost of Department of Employmentstaff engaged on general manpower, economic policy (manpower),industrial relations and incomes together with the new Conciliation and arbitration Service, the Office of Manpower Economics, industrialtribunals and the Industrial Arbitration Board. Provision is made for continuing the Community Industry Scheme in which a total of 4,000 young people previously unemployed have, since its inception in 1972, beenemployed on tasks of social value. The future scope and organisation of theScheme are under review.Central and miscellaneous services53. The content of this heading has altered substantially from that in cmnd 5519 because of the creation of four new departments out of theDepartment of Trade and Industry. Included are the central salaries andgeneral administrative expenses of the Department of Energy, the Depart-ment of Industry, including Regional Offices, together with those of theDepartments of Trade and Prices and Consumer Protection, and the ex-penses of the Price Commission. Also included are subscriptions to inter-national postal and telecommunications organisations and certain payments to the Post Office.54. This heading also covers Department of Employment expenditureon services for the seriously disabled consisting mainly of grants towardsthe cost of Remploy Limited, local authorities and other bodies which provide employment under sheltered conditions.

55. The other main field of expenditure is in respect of the occupationalsafety and health services which are being reorganised under the termsof the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. The Health and SafetyCommission came into being on 1 October 1974 and the Health and safety Executive on 1 January 1975. Various government inspectoratesand the Employment Medical Advisory Service were transferred to theExecutive from that date.56. Lastly, it covers the Royal Commission on the Distribution of income and Wealth together with Department of Employment expenditureon international relations work (mainly the subscription to the Inter-national Labour Office) and central, agency and miscellaneous services. Thelatter represents central and common services not attributable to other employment programmes.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE57. Expenditure on regional development grants was increased by theupgrading of some assisted areas in August 1974. Forecasts are, however,lower overall, reflecting the rate at which grants have been taken up so far.Expenditure on payments of regional employment premia has been increased by the decisions to continue payment beyond September 1974,to double the rate, and to upgrade the assisted areas.58. There is increased expenditure on the BR211, including Govera-ment support for the RB211-524, but there are reductions on Concorde andthe HS146.59. The estimates of nuclear expenditure are higher than those givenin Cmnd 5519 for 1974-75 onwards. This reflects increased provision forpower reactor research and development following the Governmentsrecent review of policy on nuclear reactor system (Cmnd 5695) and alsorevised forecasts for participation in the international centrifuge project for enriching uranium. The estimates also include for the first time provisionfor further capital for British Nuclear Fuels Limited and the RadiochemicalCentre Limited.60. Estimates for the refinancing of export lending and home ship-building lending differ from those given in Cmnd 5519 because they are based on more recent forecasts of current account deposits of the clearing banks and the amount of fixed rate credit which will be extended by the banks.61. There are increases under support for nationalised industriesbecause the deficits of the three industries (electricity, gas and the PostOffice) receiving compensation for price restraint were considerably higher in 1973-74 than estimated at the time of the last White Paper. The estimate for 1974-75 is also much higher than the provisional figure then included. ,

The energy industries together account for about 40 per cent ofthe total investment programme of the nationalised industries. Of therest the most important single programmes are those of the Post Officeand the British Steel Corporation.2. The total of actual expenditure on fixed assets continues year by year to fall short of the sum of forecasts for individual industries. Topresent a more realistic estimate of total expenditure the shortfall provision in this White Paper has therefore been increased from  100 million in eachyear to  150 million in 1974-75 and  300 million for subsequent years.

The Governmenfs intention to reduce dependence on importedsources of energy is reflected in significantly increased investment pro-grammes for coal and gas. Programmes other than energy were affected bythe cuts for 1974-75 (totalling  282 million) announced in December 1973.More detailed explanations of changes are provided in the notes on individual programmes: of particular significance are downward revisionsfor the British Steel Corporation and the British Airways Board.

National Coal Board capital expenditure relates mainly to coal-mining, but an increasing proportion relates to offshore exploration anddevelopment which will be taken over by the proposed British National OilCorporation. Some expenditure relates to opencast mining and to solidsmokeless fuel manufacturing, coal merchanting and chemicals. Financialassistance by the Government for the Board&apos;s current account is described in Chapter 4, paragraphs 34 to 37.5. There are substantial increases in expenditure envisaged in Table 2.5compared with Cmnd 5519. These are mainly attributable to the coal-mining and offshore activities of the NCB.6. Arising out of the Coal Industry Examination the Governmenthave approved in principle NCB&apos;s plans to spend some  600 million overthe next ten years in addition to their normal  70- 80 million continuinginvestment on mining; individual projects will continue to be subjected to the normal investment appraisal tests. This will enable the NCB to generate over 40 million tons of new capacity to replace capacity whichwill be lost due to exhaustions in the period to 1985. This programme isintended to maintain deep-mined output at a level of at least 120 million tons a year over the next 10 years. The increase in expenditure from thiscause compared with Cmnd 5519 is some  125 million over the 4 years1974-75 to 1977-78 inclusive.
7. Further exploration successes in the North Sea have led to an expansion of NCB&apos;s development plans. The provision in Table 2.5 coversNCB&apos;s share of the development of the Hutton, Thistle and Dunlin fields.These plans for increased expenditure on development and a substantiallyexpanded exploration programme together account for an increase of some 55 million compared with Cmnd 5519 over the 4 years 1974-75 to 1977-78.However, as stated in the White Paper on United Kingdom Offshore Oiland Gas Policy (Cmnd 5696) the Board&apos;s offshore oil and gas interestswill be taken over by the proposed British National Oil Corporation when this is established. This element of the National Coad Board&apos;s capitalexpenditure will then disappear.Electricity8. Electricity demand for Great Britain forecast earlier in 1974 bythe Electricity Council and the Scottish electricity boards is as follows Year 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80Sales (million kWh) 229,147 240,407 254,036 268,776 283,926 299,136Simultaneous MaximumDemand (SMD) (million kW) 51-9 53-5 56-3 59-2      62-1       65-1A comparison of these forecasts with those underlying the capital invest-ment provision in Cmnd 5519 shows that, although electricity demand from1975-76 onwards is expected to grow at about the same average annual rate (about 5 per cent a year), growth in the immediate future will beslower. Over the whole period, the figures indicate that growth will be delayed by a year compared with the forecasts made in 1973.9. Expenditure on generation, accounting for a steadily rising propor-tion of the programme, depends primarily upon the forecast of SMD for six years and more ahead because of the construction time of majorpower stations. But other factors must be taken into account. For example,a planning margin of generating capacity over the forecast SMD isnecessary to keep to an acceptable level the risks of power cuts due toplant breakdowns, exceptionally adverse weather and higher demand growththan that assumed in the forecast. This planning margin remains at 20 percent. The estimates in Table 2.5 allow for two conventional stations to be ordered in 1975-76, although these and others in later years are subject to confirmation in the light of future load forecasts. 1975-76 is also expectedto see initial commitments made by the Electricity Boards on the pro-gramme of power stations using Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactors(SGHWR&apos;s) announced by the Secretary of State for Energy in July 1974.10. Reinforcement and extension of the transmission and distribu-tion system accounts for about one third of the total investment by theElectricity Boards. This is more dependent upon forecasts of localiseddemand and economic activity two or three years ahead, and is particu-larly sensitive to new housing and industrial development requirements.11. Forecasts of demand and sales, and capital expenditure necessaryto meet demand, can only be broadly related. Although the investment overthe next five years shown in Table 2.5 increases year by year for GreatBritain as a whole, it is lower in each year than the figures in Cfnnd 5519.These lower figures reflect in the main the lower SMD forecasts made bythe industry in 1974 with consequent effects on plant ordering, and the
decision in July 1974 to go for an initial 4,000MW programme of SGHWR&apos;srather than the larger programme of nuclear stations of a then undecidedtype for which provision was made in Cmnd 5519.12. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer made clear in his budget statement on 12 November, one of the Governmenfs objectives is to restore energy prices to realistic levels as soon as possible for energyconservation and general energy policy reasons. Realistic pricing of elec-tricity should reduce demand and thus the capital investment necessary tomeet it, and the industry&apos;s 1974 demand forecasts and the investment pro-grammes summarised in Table 2.5 anticipate a movement towards more realistic prices.Gas13. The British Gas Corporation last year signed contracts with the producers in both the United Kingdom and Norwegian sectors of theFrigg field for the purchase of gas from the field rising to an estimated1,600 million cubic feet a day by 1978. This is equivalent to about half thetotal quantity of gas distributed by the Corporation in the financial year1973-74. The Norwegian government has since consented to the export ofthe gas from their sector. British Gas are negotiating with Shell/Essofor the gas found in association with oil in the Brent field and with british petroleum for a small quantity of gas available from, the Forties field.14. The gas industry&apos;s capital programme at  1,043 million includes provision at current estimates for absorbing gas from the Frigg and Brentfields, and other smaller fields already under contract, during the period to 1978-79. In connection with these additional supplies work has started on the construction of a new terminal at St Fergus initially for the reception and treatment of gas from the Frigg field. Work has also started on extending the mains transmission system to the North of Scotland.Expenditure by wholly owned subsidiaries is now included in the forecastsfollowing their consolidation in the new form of accounts agreed for theCorporation. Expenditure on fixed assets by the subsidiaries, estimated at 80 million, over the period relates to development of offshore and onshoregas and oil discoveries in partnership with the private sector and to further exploration work.15. The programme for 1974-75 to 1977-78 (excluding expenditure bywholly owned subsidiaries) shows an increase of  100 million on Cmnd 5519.This increase is mainly attributable to the provision now included forabsorbing gas from the Brent field.16. Sales of gas during 1973-74 rose by 12.8 per cent over the levelestablished in the previous year with daily deliveries averaging 3,000 million cubic feet. Industrial sales in particular continued to expand strongly andin. 1973-74 more gas was sold in this market than in the domestic market.Total gas sales during the past five years in the main markets were million therms1969-70    1970-71    1971-72    1972-73    1973-74Domestic    ............    3,362       3,653       4,045       4,603       5,035Commercial.........     ... .   714 776 877       1,046       1,153Industrial    ............    1,159       1,704       3,070       4,530       5,299Total gas sold       ...     ...     ...    5,235       6,133       7,992      10,179     11,487

The appliances of a further 1.9 million consumers were converted to burn natural gas in the twelve months to 30 September 1974, bringing the total to 11.1 million. The latest estimate is that conversion will becompleted during 1976 at a cost of some  560 million^). This is comparable to the estimate given in Cmnd 5519.Steel19. The British Steel Corporation^ capital investment programme for1974-75 to 1978-79 is intended to take the Corporation beyond the half-waypoint in the 10 year Development Strategy announced in February 1973(Cmnd 5226).20. The Government is currently reviewing the closures fof steel worksproposed in connection with the Corporation^ development plans, and the outcome of this review may affect the detailed content of the DevelopmentStrategy.21. The early part of the period will see the commissioning of the major developments which are already under way at Scunthorpe, Teesside,Llanwern and Ravenscraig. New investment programmes will be carried through in the Sheffield area, to modernise and expand stainless steelcapacity, and at Hunterston in Ayrshire, where an ore terminal is under construction and a direct reduction pelletisation plant is to be built. further expansion of modern steelmaking capacity during the period is expected toraise the Corporation^ total production capability for liquid steel to nearly30 million tonnes by 1978-79. In parallel, there will be a need for substantialinvestment in modernising the Corporation^ iron-making and rolling plant.22. The public expenditure revisions announced by the last Govern-ment on 17 December 1973 included a reduction of  74 million(compared with Cmnd 5519) in the British Steel Corporation^ capitalexpenditure in 1974-75. This reduction is reflected in the Corporation^current estimates. The forecast level of capital expenditure in 1975-76 to1977-78, as indicated in this White Paper, is somewhat lower than was previously proposed, and the peak of expenditure in the period is nowshown to occur in 1976-77 rather than in 1977-78. However, the phasing of the capital investment programme is under continuing examination bythe Corporation.  ,!(*) This expenditure is not in Table &apos;2.5.

The early years are affected by the 20 per cent cut in capital expenditure in 1974-75 imposed bythe last Government in December 1973. The Government reduced this toabout 13 per cent for telecommunications over the year as a whole.24. The objectives of the telecommunications investment programme are to expand the system to meet consumer demand, to improve the quality of existing services, particularly the international services, and to meet thedemand for new kinds of service. The programme within the United King-dom provides for the supply of some eight million telephone connectionsover the next five years giving a net growth in the system of five millionconnections. This is to be compared with a net growth of four millionconnections in the five years to March 1974. The overall size of the telephone system will thus be increased from 12 million to 17 millionworking connections. The programme also provides for the conversion ofthe few remaining manual telephone exchanges to automatic working; forthe achievement of full subscriber trunk dialling access and the extensionof international subscriber dialling to 95 per cent of customers; for thereduction of congestion on trunk and international routes; and for continuedgrowth in the telex service and in data transmission terminals.25. For all these purposes investment will be made in new exchanges,extensions to existing exchange buildings and equipment, enlargement oflocal line networks to customers&apos; premises and increased cable capacity fortelephone and other telecommunications services. About one third of the investment is for exchange equipment including new and enlarged inter-national exchanges to relieve congestion and to meet the continuing increasein international telecommunications traffic. Other large items are customers&apos;installations, land and buildings and local and other lines. The programmealso includes expenditure on exchange equipment modernisation.26.

The postal programme is designed to maintain existing servicesand to increase the efficiency of the business. Over 70 per cent of the pro-gramme will be devoted to the provision of accommodation: mainly toreplace buildings which have to be given up, or are obsolete with seriousdeficiencies in space and to provide buildings to serve new areas of popula-tion growth. A further 10 per cent of the investment will be for the replacement and growth of the motor vehicle fleet and for office machines.The remainder will be spent on completing the mechanisation of parcel
sorting, and on continuing the process of letter mechanisation, in orderto reduce the labour dependence of the postal services.

The Board take theview that after a pause of two years the pattern of traffic growth shouldbe resumed, albeit at a slower rate.British Airports Authority31. The British Airports Authority (BAA) plans to spend  142 million in the period 1974-75 to 1978-79 on capital investment. This expenditure will be at the five airports which it controlled up to 31st December 1974(Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Prestwick and Edinburgh); at Aberdeen,which it took over from the Civil Aviation Authority on 1 January 1975;and at Glasgow, which it is to take over from Glasgow Corporation on1 April 1975. The Department of Trade will contribute about  16 million at current prices to the cost of developments at Edinburgh and Aberdeenairports.32. About two-thirds of the total expenditure will be on work at heathrow and Gatwick to cater for the forecast growth of traffic to theearly 1980s. Following the Governmenfs review of the project last year,Maplin has been cancelled. There is no provision in the present forecasts for any development at BAA airports to provide for increased traffic in later years as a result of this decision, but the future arrangements for handling air traffic in the London area, and their possible implications forthe BAA&apos;s airports, are currently under consideration.

33. The traffic forecasts on which earlier forecasts of capital expen-diture were based have been invalidated by the oil crisis. New forecasts for1982 and 1990, reflecting the increase in fuel prices, were provided in theDepartment of Trade&apos;s report &quot;Maplin Review of Airport Project&quot; pub-lished on 18 July 1974, and further work on traffic forecasts is in progress.It is now expected that the number of passengers, rather than the numberof aircraft movements, will be the main determinant of airport investment in this period, and it has been assumed that the total number of terminalpassengers passing through the BAA&apos;s airports (excluding Aberdeen andGlasgow) will be as in the table below:1969-70   1970-71   1971-72   1972-73   1973-74Terminal passengers (millions)Actual       ...............       18-5       21-0       23-0       25-5        27-51974-75   1975-76   1976-77   1977-78   1978-79Present assumptions       .........       27-5        30-0       32-5        35-5        38-5Cmnd 5519 forecast       .........       30-5        33-5        37-0       40-534. BAA&apos;s total capital expenditure is about the same as that forecastlast year, after allowance is made for the deduction of  3.7 million thenincluded for work at Maplin and for the addition of the cost of develop-ment at Aberdeen and Glasgow.Surface transport industries british Railways Board35. Investment by the British Railways Board will rise, so far asrestraints on public expenditure allow, to continue the improvement of therailway system.36. Cmnd 5519 provided for rail links to Maplin and the ChannelTunnel. This year that for Maplin has been omitted because the airportproject has been discontinued. The Channel Tunnel rail link has also been omitted pending the investigation of lower-cost options announced by theSecretary of State for the Environment on 26 November 1974; appropriateprovision will be made once decisions have been reached.37. The presentation of the Board&apos;s investment figures has also been changed. The line in Table 2.5 above now covers all investment by british railways (including that in commuter railways previously shown separately -ately in Table 2.6). Contributions to railway investment by Passenger Trans-port Executives (PTE&apos;s) and local authorities continue to be shown inTable 2.6 and, to avoid double-counting, a suitable deduction is made i . contribution by PTE&apos;s (included as part of &quot;Other direct invest-ment&quot; in Table 2.6):  million1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-797-2 21-8 31-2 33-7 33-7ii. capital grants by local authorities to BRB and other operators  million1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79- 0-6 1-6 2-6 2-6
British Transport Docks Board38. The Board has 19 docks which handled 90 million tonnes of freightin 1973. The investment figures include provision for the fish docks atFleetwood, Lowestoft, Grimsby and Hull; for development at Southamptonand the South Wales docks; and for other projects on the Humber.British Waterways Board39. The Board are reviewing their long-term policy in consultationwith the Department of the Environment. In the meantime the sameprovision has been made as in Cmnd 5519.National Freight Corporation40. The Corporation operates some 24,000 road vehicles, about 10 percent of the market in the &quot;for hire&quot; road haulage industry. The provisionfor the Corporation^ investment in Cmnd 5519 was mainly for replacementand modernisation. In the light of experience over the first five years of its existence, the Corporation now plans to maintain its competitive position by developing existing and new services and facilities to meet changingpatterns of customer demand. The investment levels provide accordingly.The Corporation is also undertaking a considerable expansion into Europeanmarkets and provision for this is included under &quot;Other capital expenditure&quot;.National Bus Company41. The National Bus Company&apos;s subsidiaries, with a fleet totallingsome 20,000 buses and coaches, operated over 730 million vehicle miles in 1973. Investment provides mainly for necessary replacement of vehicles and for improvement of maintenance facilities. The provision is higherthan that in Cmnd 5519 to enable the Company to reduce the increasingaverage age of its fleet, and to catch up with improvements to depot facilities.Scottish Transport Group42. The established pattern of capital expenditure by the Group isexpected to continue for the next five years during which approximately60 per cent of their annual programme is for the normal replacement ofbuses. Most of the remainder is for roll-on/roll-off vehicle ferries and asso-ciated terminals for both major and minor routes; this expenditure is inaccordance with Government policy as announced by the Secretary ofState for Scotland on 18 April 1972 for development of sea transport tothe Scottish Islands and should result in more efficient services.Transport Holding Company43. The Transport Holding Company was dissolved on 31 March 1973,after the sale of its remaining subsidiary.

The format used in Cmnd 5519 for public expenditure on roads and Transport has been changed, mainly to group together all expenditure by local authorities. Details of major classification changes are set out inPart 4. The principal reason is the introduction of Transport SupplementaryGrants (see paragraphs 13 to 16 below).2. Transport policies have been consolidated and developed but major economic constraints have contributed to several reductions during thepast two years, particularly in road construction. Compared with the 1972White Paper (Cmnd 5178) there have been reductions of nearly 40 per cent to expenditure in 1976-77 on new construction and improvement of roadsin England. These reductions included switching some resources from road construction to rail. Expenditure is also affected by the announcement inthe recent Report (HC 74) on the Rate Support Grant (No. 2) Order1974, in which the Government published their decision temporarily to sup-port high levels of revenue support by local authorities to public transport,particularly bus and underground services.RoadsGeneral3. Last year over 90 per cent of passenger miles were on roads, ofwhich about 20 per cent was by public transport; 65 per cent of all freightton miles were on roads compared with 18 per cent on rail and 17 per cent by other forms of transport such as coastal shipping and inland waterways.Road safety4. Road accidents in the United Kingdom have been increasing lessthan the increase in motor traffic, but they continue to impose a heavy burden. In 1973, 7,400 people were killed in road accidents, nearly 90,000were seriously injured, and 250,000 were slightly injured. So far as the costs can be quantified they amount to at least  700 million. Expenditure
on new construction, improvement, and maintenance of roads, detailedbelow, helps to reduce accidents. Quite small road improvement schemescan produce benefits many times greater than their costs. Grants to theRoyal Society for the Prevention of Accidents are included under Motorwayand Trunk Road current expenditure. Other Government expendituredirected towards road safety is included elsewhere in the White Paper (road safety publicity, driver and vehicle testing, licensing of freight operators,road safety research, etc). Local authority expenditure on road safety is described below.Motorways and trunk roadsENGLANDCapital expenditure New construction and improvement5. As the Minister for Transport announced last June, the continuingroad programme is necessary, both on environmental and economic grounds.But it is no longer a growth programme.6. The planned network of 3,500 miles of high quality strategic routesby the early 1980s announced in 1971 is no longer practicable. Insteadresources are being concentrated on the completion of a basic 3,100 milenetwork of routes designed particularly to respond to the use of heavylorries; 1,800 miles are already open to traffic, including 1,032 miles ofmotorway. The remainder should be ready by the early 1980s.7. In building the network, maximum use is made of existing roads,and therefore of investment already made. Better value for money is tobe achieved through better use of road space. Studies have shown thatvehicle and driver performance have improved so that modern motorwayscan take more traffic in safety. New design standards have therefore been introduced. In some cases these will demand dual 2-lane roads instead ofdual 3-lane and in some cases single rather than dual carriageway.8. But there will be no economies in environmental standards. TheDepartment of the Environment aims for the maximum efficiency with theminimum damage to the surrounding landscape. The independent advice of the Landscape Advisory Committee is particularly important. And more money is going under the Land Compensation Act 1973 to people whosehouses are affected by road schemes. Much is spent on measures to reducethe effect of noise on those living near motorways.9. The proportion of new construction using concrete may increasein future owing to the changed relative costs of tarmacadam and concrete.Current expenditure Maintenance10. The programme for bringing trunk roads up to the initial standardsrecommended by the Marshall Committee will come to an end in 1974-75.The lower rate of new road openings has been taken into account. Higherfuel prices are not expected to reduce significantly the use of commercial vehicles which most affect the structure of roads. Their greater use of themotorway and trunk road network requires more expenditure on mainten-ance, involving the overlaying, resurfacing or other treatment of some 500miles of;motorway over the next five years.SCOTLAND11. The Scottish Road Programme continues to have two chief aims,both closely related to the economic development of the country. The first
is the completion of the Central Scotland Motorway and Dual Carriagewaynetwork, which will continue to play an important part in the economicregeneration of the traditionally industrialised and heavily populated centralbelt of Scotland. The second aim is to provide better roads, including thereconstruction of the A9 from Perth to Invergordon, to meet the pressuresof oil related developments, especially in North and North East Scotland.The figures in table 2.6, although inevitably influenced by the expenditure cuts announced in mid-December 1973, provide for further major contri-butions towards these two aims.WALES12. The principal objectives of the Secretary of State remain theimprovement of east-west road communications across both North andSouth Wales, and of the road links between Wales and the major industrial and commercial areas of England. The westward extension of the M4motorway a project vital to the economy of industrial South Wales remains the dominant single item in terms of public expenditure in theearlier years covered by this report.Local transport: England and WalesGENERAL13. This new section brings together the transport expenditure forwhich local authorities are responsible and reflects the comprehensiveapproach to grant-aiding local transport expenditure under the new systemof Exchequer support introduced by the 1974 Local Government Act.14. In England and Wales, the Local Government Act 1972 creatednew County and Metropolitan County Councils with comprehensive powersand duties to deal with transport, and covering areas better suited to trans-port planning. These same authorities are responsible for structure planning.In addition, under the Local Government Act 1974 most of the presentCentral Government specific grants for local transport purposes, whichwere paid at varying rates and to various bodies, will be discontinued. Infuture, part of the Central Government aid to transport will continue to beincluded in the Rate Support Grant (RSG) but there will be further assistance through the Transport Supplementary Grants (TSG). TSG willbe payable to counties whose estimated expenditure for the following grantyear, to the extent that it is accepted by the Secretaries of State, exceeds a prescribed threshold.15. Each County in England and Wales is to submit annually astatement of Transport Policies and Programmes (TPP) to the secretaries of State. The detailed scrutiny of individual proposals, which was partof the specific grant system, is being replaced by a broad consideration ofthe proposed transport programme. The Government are concerned tosee that proposals as a whole are worthwhile and realistic but will not seek to substitute their judgement for that of the local authority in deciding exactpriorities within the limited overall resources available nor in the use of grant once allocated. Central Government will influence, but not control indetail, the expenditure of a local authority through TSG and RSG,and its capital expenditure through a new system of borrowing approvals.One consequence of the freedom for local authorities to determine the spending priorities within the new system is that the divisions of expenditure within the Local Transport Section of the Table can only be indicative, par-ticularly in later years, of the main trends expected.
16. The changes described above do not of themselves mean any changesin the level of public expenditure on transport. Indeed, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer in his Budget Statement on 12 November forewarned that local authorities would be expected lo assist in the achievement of national economic objectives and their prospective expenditure has been restrictedaccordingly. The recent circulars (DOE 171/74, Welsh Office 282/74) on local authority expenditure confirmed that prospective capital expenditurehad been reduced, Government assistance to revenue support would belimited in future years, and expenditure on road maintenance would beheld at the same level for 1975-76 as for 1974-75.CAPITAL INVESTMENTRoads new construction and improvement17. This expenditure relates to all roads over which local authoritieshave control, including certain roads in New Towns. Local authority roadimprovements serve many important purposes: they may create environ-mental improvements, serve new development or provide bypasses. Butoverall expenditure is expected to decline slightly over the period, partly inview of the economic situation and partly as a policy to make more money available for rail travel.Car parks18. This includes expenditure by local authorities on lorry parks toreduce heavy vehicle parking in residential areas.Public transport investment19. This heading includes all public transport investment by localauthorities, Passenger Transport Executives and London Transport Execu-tive. The investment, which is similar in each year of the period, coverspurchases of new buses and both renewal and improvements to equipment and infrastructure: eg new rolling stock and extensions to the LondonUnderground, the Tyneside Rapid Transit system now under construction,bus lanes and bus stations. The investment by local authorities and PTEsin rail services has been included both here and in the nationalised industries and in Table 2.5, but to avoid double counting it has been deducted from the totals in the latter table. Investment by the British Railways Board in theLondon Commuter Rail network, which is directly grant-aided by theDepartment of the Environment rather than by local authorities, togetherwith certain other British Railways Board projects already in progress forwhich Central Government grants will be paid, are included in Table 2.5without any offset, and not in this Table.CURRENT EXPENDITURERoads Maintenance20. As with many items of local authority expenditure, the 1975-76estimates show no growth over the expected 1974-75 outturn. Thereafteran increase is provided sufficient to allow slight improvement in standards.Research is in progress to improve the effectiveness of road maintenance expenditure.
Car parks21. Restraint on the use of cars in urban centres, together with theprovision of some additional parking facilities at strategic points, reducescongestion, particularly that arising from journeys to work, and helpsthe operation of public transport. Certain local authority parking chargeshave been released from price control and net revenue from parking isexpected to increase.Other expenditure22. This includes some expenditure by local authorities on Road Safety.The Road Traffic Act 1974 requires local authorities to promote road safety by studying accidents, by considering remedies and by education,training and planning.Passenger transport subsidies British Rail23. Subsidies are paid by PTEs and local authorities to meet lossesarising on local rail services which the authorities consider to be a necessarypart of the public transport system in their areas.Passenger transport subsidies other24. This covers subsidies paid to bus, underground and ferry services by local authorities. Many local authorities decided earlier this year thatit was preferable to meet cost increases out of the rates rather than fromfares. The increase in subsidies has been reflected in the revised 1974-75estimates. The Governments view is that it would be undesirable forthese subsidies to increase much further in 1975-76 and that thereafterthey should be reduced. The evidence does not suggest that low fares are particularly significant in attracting back bus users from cars, nor thatthey are a good way of helping the poorer sections of the community.However, to avoid very rapid and heavy fare increases it is proposed thatthe subsidies be progressively reduced in England and Wales from  102million in 1975-6 to  50m in 1978-79. For 1975-76 the whole of the  102million will be eligible expenditure for the purposes of TSG; in this way theGovernment are meeting a large part of the cost which would otherwisefall on the local rates. Local authorities have been asked to consider what measures they might implement to encourage bus usage and to reduceoperating costs.Local transport: Scotland25. The reorganisation of local government in Scotland which will take effect on 16 May 1975 has produced a smaller number of councils regional and islands-with responsibility for local transport. A system of TransportPolicies and Programmes will then be introduced. The policies and principlesexpressed in the foregoing paragraphs will in general apply and most specific grants are being discontinued. Local transport activities will be supportedinstead by an extension of the rate support grant. Capital expenditure willbe regulated under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.26. Considerable emphasis is being placed on the improvement of public transport services: examples are major improvements to the GlasgowUnderground and the project for the re-opening of the Central Low LevelLine in Greater Glasgow.
Central Government subsidiesNationalised industries27. The largest item in this block represents support to the british railways Board (BRB). Provision is above that in Cmnd 5519; by  80million in 1974-75, and by  144 million in 1978-79. The railways&apos; financialposition is deteriorating because of increases in costs which have not beenrecovered in higher charges. The estimates are on the same accountingbasis as Cmnd 5519 and have not been adjusted for the reconstruction of theBoard&apos;s finances under the Railways Act 1974. Total subsidies, includingindicative sums for payments by the PTEs (which are included in localtransport above) are likely to be:					  million	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79Direct support by Central Government	275	298	314	322	343Payments to PTEs:					Scotland     ............	1	5	5	5	5Others       ............	12	13	14	14	15Total      ............	288	316	333	341	363Two other industries require support in 1974-75 and subsequently:(a) the British Waterways Board receives grants for essential maintenanceof the Board&apos;s waterways and to improve to modern traffic standards about400 bridges carrying public roads over the waterways;(b) the provision covers grants to the Scottish Transport Group for losses on those Western Islands shipping services which are operated by itssubsidiary, David MacBrayne Limited.Other28. The main item is the refund of fuel duty to operators of busstage services for about 1,500 million miles of stage carriage service runeach year. Increases in duty have been refunded to such operators since1964 and full remission of duty, amounting to 22 p per gallon, has been allowed since 12 February 1974 because of the immediately precedingsharp increase in motor fuel prices. In addition 50 per cent grants towardsthe cost of buying new buses for use on stage services are being paid onabout 3,500 buses each year. These grants help the operators to provideimproved services by enabling them to maintain up-to-date fleets andstimulate one-man operation. Total investment in new buses by municipalbus operators, Passenger Transport Executives and the London transport executive appears under &quot;local transport, other direct investment&apos; in Table2.6, and similar investment by the National Bus Company and the Scottish transport Group appears under nationalised industries capital expenditurein Table 2.5. In order to avoid double counting, provision is made underthe Central Government subsidies heading for grants to the private sectoronly.29. The Railways Act 1974 empowered the Secretary of State to make grants towards the provision of facilities for the loading or unloading of rail freight. Tentative provision has been made in Table 2.6 for the pay-ment of grant to the private sector. Grant aided expenditure by public sector bodies will form part of their capital programmes.
30. Other subsidies include those under the Highlands and. IslandsShipping Services Act 1960 for sea transport services and to Orkney andShetland.Ports and shippingPorts31. The provision covers investment by the independent harbour trustsand local authority owned harbours, and grants and loans to ports in theprivate sector. Expenditure in this area is considered together with portinvestment in the nationalised industry sector (ie by the British transport docks Board see paragraph 38 of Chapter 5); Cmnd 5519 figures for1975-76 to 1977-78 have been reduced by 5 per cent (except for the pro-vision for North Sea oil see below).32. Cmnd 5519 made only minimal provision for port developmentsto deal with North Sea oil. It is now known that substantial expenditureon a new port at Sullom Voe in the Shetland Isles, and other develop-ments in the Orkneys, will certainly be required. The Sullom Voe develop-ment is expected to be undertaken by the Zetland County Council whohave recently obtained the necessary powers. No precise estimates areavailable but public expenditure is likely to build up from about  10million in 1975-76 to  15 million in 1978-79. No provision has been madefor ports in the Celtic Sea area.33. Grants are payable by the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and food for the improvement of fishing facilities. Provision is included for grants towards expenditure at the Port of Tyne in 1974-75 and 1975-76.In addition, expenditure by the British Transport Docks Board at Fleet-wood, Lowestoft, Grimsby and Hull qualifies for this grant see Chapter5 paragraph 39.Shipping services34. This programme is directed mainly towards safety at sea, includingthe Coastguard service, the survey of ships, examination of seamen, theprovision of other services such as navigational broadcasts, and the opera-tion of a trawler support ship. Provision is also made to deal with theprevention of oil pollution, for certain security measures in connection withthe Northern Ireland emergency and for the United Kingdom contributions towards the running costs of the Intergovernmental Maritime consultative organisation. The monitoring and assistance of shipping in the english channel through the Channel Navigation Information Service is to be im-proved by the extension of radar coverage.Civil aviation services35. Provision is made for the grant-in-aid to the Civil Aviation Author-ity to cover its deficit on revenue account; it is intended that this grant-in-aid should eventually be eliminated. The programme also covers capitalexpenditure by the Civil Aviation Authority, mainly on equipment and installations for the National Air Traffic Services, and by local authorities on aerodromes. Under &quot;Other civil aviation services&apos; is included the UK&apos;ssubscriptions to euro control and to the International Civil AviationOrganisation and expenditure on aviation security measures.

37. The Civil Aviation Authority is currently engaged in a majorprogramme of re-equipment to enable it to handle safely a greater volumeof aircraft movements and an increasing proportion of high-speed aircraft.Numbers of movements handled by UK air traffic control grew steadilyin the five years to 1973, as shown below:1969 1970 1971 1972 19731,063,352 1,142,796 1,217,406 1,258,031 1,345,243Other transport services38. As well as expenditure on central government administration and receipts from fees for driving and vehicle tests, provision is made forminor items, including the small amount of Department of the Environ-ment expenditure on the proposed Channel Tunnel. If it goes ahead the project itself however will be financed mainly by private sector loans whichwould not count as public expenditure.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE39. Policy changes since Cmnd 5519 include the effect of the generalcuts in public expenditure on the various programmes including roads, theincrease in local authorities&apos; subsidies of bus and underground services, andthe cancellation of Maplin Airport. The principal estimating change is theincreased Central Government subsidy to the BRB to maintain a railway&apos; network of roughly the present size.I

Because of the high priority which the Government is giving to housing, forecast expenditure is at a substantially higher level than thatcontained in Cmnd 5519. Provision is made for much larger programmes of new housebuilding and acquisition of existing dwellings both by localauthorities and by housing associations, for subsidies to bear the major part of the cost of servicing the capital needed for those programmes, andfor a substantial increase in local authority lending for house purchase.Subsidies2. The estimates of Government subsidies are based.on the new sys-tems of housing subsidy, provided, as an interim replacement for existing legislation pending a further review, in the Housing Rents and SubsidiesBill and the Housing Rents and Subsidies (Scotland) Bill. In England andWales the new system consolidates existing subsidies at their present leveland provides for additional subsidies based mainly on the capital cost ofnew construction, improvement work and acquisitions. In 1975-76 therewill be a special element of subsidy to provide a measure of relief to rentsimmediately after the year of rent freeze in 1974-75. The rates of the newsubsidies will be fixed in advance and entitlement will not depend on rentincome. This is a corollary of the Governmenfs decision to give backto local authorities freedom to determine for themselves what distributionas between rents and rates of their housing costs, after subsidy, would be reasonable,
3. In Scotland local authorities will have the same freedom restored to them. The main change in the subsidy system will be the removal ofthe threshold of minimum expenditure per dwelling of  6 a year beforehousing expenditure subsidy is paid.4. As is noted in paragraph 15(i) the total amounts provided for sub-subsidies including rate fund contributions are approximately doubled sincethe estimates in Cmnd 5519. This is due to a number of factors including,principally, heavy increases in real costs in 1974, the rent freeze in 1974-75,and a substantially increased investment programme. The estimates for rent rebates and rent allowances are also included in these figures; provision is made for up-ratings of the needs allowance in October 1974 and april and December 1975.Option mortgages5. The option mortgage scheme is designed to give house purchasersof moderate income benefits roughly equal to those available through tax relief on mortgage interest to basic rate tax payers. The forecast reflects the increase in subsidy necessary following the change in the basic rate of income tax.Grants and loans to housing associations6. The Government has announced its intention to encourage the ex-expansion of the housing association movement as a valuable complementto the housing activities of local authorities. The Housing Act 1974 made provision for grants to enable this expansion to take place. Grants will begin to be made in 1975-76. It is estimated that after payment of housing associa-tion grant about one quarter of housing association investment will con-tinue to be financed by loan (see paragraph 11 below). Provision for this is contained within the lending figures. The total number of housing associa-tion dwellings approved by the Housing Corporation is now running at32,800 dwellings a year and another 14,000 are being approved by localauthorities; this rate is about double that of last year and provision is madefor it to be sustained.House improvement and slum clearance7. The National House Condition Survey of 1971 identified over amillion dwellings in Great Britain which were unfit and a further 2 million which lacked one or more basic amenities. These dwellings were concen-trated in the private sector. The Government is firmly committed to thelongstanding policy of financial assistance through house improvement andrenovation grants. The estimates reflect the ending in June 1974 of preferen-tial grants in the assisted areas under the Housing Act 1971, and the intro-duction of new and more discriminating grant provisions under the housing act 1974. These will re-direct assistance to areas of particular housing need.In Scotland the present increased level of investment by local authorities inthe improvement of their own houses will be maintained; in England andWales a reduced rate of expenditure on such work will reflect the com-pletion of a period of intensive activity by many local authorities.

The figures in Cmnd 5519 assumed a continuation of the low levelto which local authority housebuilding had declined by 1973. The figuresof new dwellings in tenders accepted by local authorities in 1974 show thatthe initiatives taken by the Government have helped to reverse the trend.This is reflected in the figures in Table B and in the expenditure forecast.TABLE BPERMANENT DWELLINGS APPROVED: LOCAL AUTHORITIES,NEW TOWNS AND THE SCOTTISH SPECIAL HOUSING ASSOCIATIONGreat Britain1968.....................      ... 185,1311969   ......      .................. 149,3761970   ........................ 120,4761971   ........................ 116,8921972   ........................ 105,8431973   ........................ 103,4221974 provisional     .................. 135,0009. The investment forecast also reflects the acquisition by local authori-ties of houses built by developers. This follows the initiative taken by theGovernment to bring completed but unsold private houses into use. Provi-sion is also made for a continuing programme of acquisition of existingdwellings in pursuance of the Government^ objective of extending socialownership particularly in order to improve conditions in the areas ofworst housing stress. Overall net investment has been substantially increasedby reduced estimates of future sales of local authority housing. This is largely offset by a reduction in lending (see paragraph 10 below).Lending10. The total estimates for lending after 1974-75 are substantially lower than in Cmnd 5519. This reflects two factors: first some of the financialassistance previously classified- as loans will now be provided by the new capital grants to housing associations (see paragraph 6); second a substantial reduction is forecast in lending to council tenants buying their houses on mortgage or instalment. This latter largely offsets the reduction in receipts from sales described in the preceding section on investment. It followsfrom a re-appraisal of local authorities&apos; policies in this area and hence ofthe number of sales that they are now likely to make over the period. Theremaining provision for lending to housing associations rises over the period in line with the growth in grants to them.11. The main constituent in the figures after 1974-75 is therefore len-ding by local authorities to private individuals for house purchase. Localauthorities may lend to defined categories of priority borrowers; these include the homeless, people high on a CounciPs waiting list or displacedby new development, and people wishing to buy older property which wouldnot attract a commercial mortgage. Additionally in 1974 they have been permitted to lend to first-time purchasers of new dwellings.
12. Because of the shortage of building society funds in the early partof 1974, the 1974-75 estimate of local authority lending is exceptionally high.There has been a substantial recent improvement in Building Society receipts and 1975-76 looks therefore less likely to be exceptional. Thereafter pro-vision is made for a steady increase each year so that by 1977-78 the totalof gross lending to private individuals is about two-thirds higher than thecorresponding provision in Cmnd 5519; but the outturn in each individualyear will be significantly dependent on the availability of Building Societyloans.13. Loans by local authorities for house purchase in England andWales in recent years are shown in Table C.TABLE CLOCAL AUTHORITIES LOANS TO PRIVATE PERSONS FOR HOUSE PURCHASE:ENGLAND AND WALESNew Other Alldwellings dwellings dwellings1968     ............ 4,290 34,502 38,7921969     ............ 1,816 17,280 19,0961970     ............ 2,605 41,498 44,1031971     ............ 2,734 44,440 47,1741972     ............ 1,893 43,309 45,2021973     ............ 2,710 56,711 59,421Loans to building societies14.

Repay-ments are determined on a monthly basis by the flow of private funds intothe Building Societies, and this cannot be accurately forecast. But on anextrapolation of present trends, about  350 million will be repaid by 31March 1975 and the great bulk of the remainder in the following threemonths. If this happens, net public expenditure of  150 million in 1974-75will be balanced by repayments of  150 million in 1975-76.TABLE D .STOCK OF DWELLINGS AT END OF YEAR: BY TENURE 1966 TO 1973GREAT BRITAIN	Rented from local			N,1;&apos;   &apos; ,i&apos;H&apos;V&apos;&quot;	authorities or new				town corporations		Owner occupied			Percentage		Percentage	Thousand	of total	Thousand	&quot;of total1966	.....         5,063	28-7	8,335	47-21967	.....         5,232	29-2	8,604	48-01968	.....         5,387	29-5	8,898	48-81969	.....         5,543	300	9,131	49-41970	.....         5,698	30-4	9,356	5001971	.....         5,817	30-6	9,594	50-51972	.....         5,865	30-5	9,877	51-41973	.....         5,920	30-5	10,133	52-2Rented from private ownersowners and other tenures Total		Percentage		Thousand	of total	Thousand1966     ......	......         4,262	24-1	17,6601967     ......	4,105	22-9	17,9411968     ......	.......         3,949	21-7	18,2341969     ......	......         3,814	20-6	18,4881970	......         3,677	19-6	18,7311971     ......	......         3,588	18-9	18,9991972     ......	3,470	18-1	19,2121973     ......	3,361   &apos;	17-3	19,414
CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE15.  The main changes from Cmnd 5519 are as follows:(i) the amounts provided for subsidies are approximately doubled.(ii) local authority gross investment is increased by approximately50 per cent reflecting the increase in the housebuilding programme and the new programme of acquisition of dwellings.(iii) capital receipts from sales of local authority dwellings are reducedri    to about 25 per cent of the previous level.(iv) local authority lending for house purchase is increased by  110million in 1975-76 rising to  160 million in 1978-79.(v) the new grants to Housing Associations rise from  218 million in1975-76 to  313 million in 1978-79; corresponding reductions havebeen made in the provisions for lending.27511

Responsibility for water services in England.and Wales was trans-ferred on 1 April to nine Regional Water Authorities and the WelshNational Water Development Authority. These services consist mainly ofwater supply and conservation, sewerage and sewage disposal, land drainage,prevention of water pollution, fisheries and amenity and recreation associated -ated with water. The Authorities were set up under the Water Act 1973to manage these services as a whole. Capital expenditure on them is shownin this White Paper as a single bloc; their current expenditure is met fromcharges and does not enter into the total of public expenditure. In Scot-land water service functions remain with the local authorities and will betransferred to regional and island councils in 1975.2. Capital expenditure by the Water Authorities in England and wales will be controlled in a way similar to the nationalised industries, that is bythe allocation of capital ceilings to each Authority. A preliminary indica-tion of the information which the Government will need before approving the capital expenditure proposed each year by the Authorities was set outin the second report of the Steering Group on Water Authority Economicand Financial Objectives*. The report emphasises the need for the Authori-ties to develop corporate planning as a basis for the planning and controlof capital expenditure and to bring together full financial and physical in-formation in support of their expenditure proposals.* &quot;The Water Services: Economic and Financial Policies. Second Report to theSecretary of State for the Environment.&quot; HMSO 1974.
3. In common with most other public sector programmes, the capital programme to be undertaken by the Authorities and Scottish local authori-ties in 1974-75 as set out in Cmnd 5519 was reduced by 20 per cent inDecember 1973 and reductions have been made for subsequent years by thepresent Government. Nevertheless, the present White Paper assumes anaverage rate of growth of 7 per cent a year in expenditure on water services from 1974-75 onwards and takes account of the extra assistance to theconstruction industry in 1975-76 announced by the Chancellor of the Ex-chequer in September 1974.4. The forecasts for land drainage in England and Wales include expenditure on the Thames Tidal Flood Protection Scheme. The provisionfor other arterial drainage schemes have been reduced for 1974-75 onwards.Improvement of the Environment and Local Facilities5. This is a miscellaneous group of mainly local authority services.It includes refuse collection and disposal, smoke control, public con-conveniences and other public health expenditure, the reclamation of derelictland, the provision of parks and recreational facilities, the provision of municipal buildings and administrative services, and activities carried out under the Town and Country Planning Acts as well as a number of minorservices such as private street works, coast protection, civic theatres and restaurants, retail markets, cemeteries and crematoria.Capital6. Most of the services in this group in England and Wales come within the locally determined sector arrangements for controlling capitalexpenditure. In this sector an annual block borrowing consent is notified to local authorities. They are free to spend at their own discretion up to this amount, plus what they choose to meet from revenue or capital receipts.The locally determined sector covers a wide variety of projects, including some which fall in other programmes (See Table 3.9). It is not possible to forecast with any accuracy how much will be spent on particular services.The derelict land reclamation programme and the coast protection pro-gramme are controlled by ad hoc borrowing approvals. In Scotland nearly all local authority capital expenditure is subject to specific approval.7. In common with many other services, programmes for 1975-76onwards have been significantly reduced as compared with Cmnd 5519.These reductions are reflected in the annual borrowing limits notified to localauthorities who are having to reduce their programmes accordingly. Areduction of the magnitude made means that local authorities will have little room for manoeuvre in selecting priorities in 1975-76. They will haveto use their borrowing allocation chiefly on projects which are already committed under contract or otherwise essential.8. For the last three years local authorities in England and wales have chosen to spend more heavily on sport and recreational projectsthan before at the expense of other services within the locally determinedsector, including services in other programmes. Local government reorganisation -sation has now led to a heavy demand for office accommodation to fit thenew local authority structure. This may well lead to a change in the pattern of locally determined expenditure.
9. Local authorities are also faced with the need to extend and improve their facilities for the collection and disposal of refuse and they may find it necessary to devote a larger proportion of resources to this in future years.Current10. The figures for local authority current expenditure in 1975-76 are based on the forecasts arrived at after consultation with the local authority associations in the course of the recent rate support grant negotiations inEngland, Wales and Scotland. The real growth of about 4% over an estimated 1974-75 outturn takes account only of commitments which areinescapable, including expenditure arising from mandatory statutory obliga-tions, the consequence of demographic trends and the effects of localgovernment reorganisation. It assumes a slowing down in the rate of recruit-ment of staff, the likely consequence of which will be no improvement inthe standard of service provided; it also assumes that local authorities will increase their income by raising charges for certain services and facilities.11. The figures for subsequent years assume a further slowing downin the rate of real growth in local authority expenditure consistently withthe projection of public expenditure as a whole and there will be further consultations with the local authority associations about this requirement.Royal Palaces and Royal Parks12. This expenditure covers the maintenance, etc, of the royal palacesand royal parks in the United Kingdom.Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments &apos;13. This item covers grants for the repair of historic buildings, otherrelated services, and expenditure on the purchase, maintenance, repair anddisplay of ancient monuments. It also includes expenditure on emergencyexcavations for recording monuments before sites are developed. Detailsof the work undertaken in this field are published in the Annual Reportsof the Historic Buildings Councils and the Ancient Monuments Boards for england, Scotland and Wales, and in the Department of the Environmentsannual publication: &quot;Archaeological Excavations&quot;. The number of visitors to ancient monuments and historic buildings has risen from 11 million in1969 to 14 million in 1972 and to almost 15 million in 1973.14. As announced by the Secretary of State for the Environment on12 July, the Government proposes to match contributions raised for theNational Heritage Fund up to a Fund total of  1 million over a period of four to five years beginning in 1976-77.Environmental Research15. This item covers research support for the Department of the environment and includes research work carried out at the Departmentsthree research establishments (the Transport and Road Research Laboratory,the Building Research Establishment and the Hydraulics Research Station),the extra-mural research programme, and grants to research associations and other bodies. It also covers grants to the British Railways Board for railway research and to the London Transport Executive for rapid transitresearch.[\
CHANGES IN EXPENDITURECapital16. The main changes in the forecasts of capital expenditure since cmnd 5519 arise from the need in present circumstances to reduce public expenditure. The changes in respect of 1974-75 mainly resulted from cutsannounced by the last Government in December 1973; those in respectof other years are the result of the present review. The sum of these reductions is as follows:  million1974-75       1975-76       1976-77       1977-78Water Services   ...     .........      92-4 81-6 85-4 91-1Improvement of the Environment andlocal facilities............      54-9 81-5 74-4 78-117. In September, the Chancellor announced a short-term increase in public capital expenditure programmes to help the construction industry.The amounts applicable to this programme are:    million1975-76Water Services   .........     .....................      23-2Improvement of the Environment and local facilities       ............      18-118. An estimating change resulting from the rephasing of purchasesand sales within the special programme for land acquisition in England forresale for private development has had the effect of increasing the figuresfor 1974-75 to 1976-77 and reducing the figure for 1977-78 as follows:  million1974-75       1975-76       1976-77       1977-78Improvement of the Environment andlocal facilities............      +6-1      &apos;   +31-4        +15-0 -13-9

PROGRAMME 9. LAW, ORDER AND PROTECTIVE services. Table 2.9 above shows expenditure on the following: the admin-istration of justice including the detention of persons remanded in custodyand of offenders serving sentences, the provision of after-care for releasedoffenders and the various non-custodial penalties available to the courts;services concerned with the protection of people and property namely thepolice and fire services; civil defence; the control of immigration; thedevelopment of good community relations (including provisions for special needs through the Urban Programme) and grants towards certain voluntary services. The greater part of the expenditure is incurred initially by localauthorities on services to which the Government contributes by way of specific grants and rate support grant.Administration of justiceCourt services England and wales. Local authority expenditure on day-to-day running costs of magistrates&apos; and other lower courts, accounts for  26.1 million in 1974-75rising to  31.7 million in 1978-79 within current expenditure on courtservices etc. The increase over the period reflects the expanding work-loadof the courts and is generally in line with the assumptions in Cmnd 5519.The provision for accommodation is  9.4 million in 1974-75 rising to  13.4 million in 1978-79, about 25 per cent lower than in Cmnd 5519. Provisionfor payment of costs awarded in magistrates&apos; and crown courts at  8.3 million in 1974-75 rising to  9.8 million in 1978-79 is about    million a year more than Cmnd 5519 due to a rise in the estimated number of cases.
Higher courts -.3. Table A below shows the pattern of expenditure on the highercourts based on separate forecasts of increased criminal and civil business.Current expenditure on staff and day-to-day running costs of the courts is broadly in line with Cmnd 5519 but the building programme is lower bysome 25 per cent.Table A Higher Courts (England and Wales)Expenditure figures are in   million1973-74  1974-75   1975-76   1976-77   1977-78   1978-79SummaryTotal Net ExpenditureCurrent ExpenditureCriminal businessCivil business(a) Total expenditure (gross)(b) Receipts......(c) Net expenditureCapital ExpenditureHigher Courts building programme(a) Expenditure(b) Number of Court rooms forthe Crown Court(i) Permanent Courtrooms started (in 9New Court Buildings)(ii) Permanent Courtrooms completed(iii) Temporary Courtrooms provided byhirings adaptions orother means(iv) Total Court rooms in use by the CrownCourt......Number of Cases/Proceedings(thousands)Criminal businessCrown Courts cases dis-posed of......Civil business(a) High Court proceedingscommenced(6) County Courts proceed-ings commencedEstimated Number of Staff in post as at 31 MarchCriminal businessCivil business......21-0	21-9	26-2	28-1	31-6	31-611-1	11-1	11-7	11-9	12-2	12-420-8 -17-9 2-9	21-7 -18-7 3-0	21-8 -190 2-8	21-9 -19-3 2-6	22-0 -19-6 2-4	22-0 -19-9 217-0	7-8	11-7	13-6	17-0	17-nil&apos;	24	25	26	24	nil nil	nil	nil	nil	2	259	14	7,	12	nil	nil252	266	273	285	287	312 ,43	46	49	53	56	59308	309	310	311	312	3131,556	1,570	1,580	1,590	1,600	1,6102,055 7,843	2,213 7,886	2,327 7,900	2,369 7,930	2,499 7,932	2,524 7,933Court services scotland. Capital expenditure on sheriff court buildings aimed at urgentimprovement and the provision of new court houses rises from  0.8 million in 1974-75 to  3.8 million in 1978-79; about 12 per cent lower than in cmnd 5519.
Other services related to crime5. Payments by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board are forecast to rise from  5.7 million in 1974-75 to  9 million in 1978-79. This assumesan intake of 14,000 cases in 1974-75 rising to just over 22,000 in 1978-79and is broadly in line with the assumptions in Cmnd 5519. More detailed information can be found in the Tenth Report of the Criminal InjuriesCompensation Board (Cmnd 5791).Legal aid. The object of the expenditure is to make legal aid, advice and assistance available to persons of limited means. The scope of the schemesis fixed by statute, so that the level of expenditure depends on the numberof eligible applicants. Eligibility in turn depends on the capital and incomelimits. Income limits are reviewed annually and capital limits from time totime as necessary.7. Expenditure in England and Wales is expected to rise steadily overthe period mainly because of the rise in criminal business. Comparedwith Cmnd 5519 there is an increase of  2.9 million over the period1974-75 to 1977-78 because the costs in criminal cases are higher than previously forecast. The number of civil cases in 1974-75 is expected to beabout 180,000 and to rise by about 2 per cent a year thereafter. criminal cases in 1974-75 are expected to be about 240,000 and to rise by about  per cent a year thereafter. In 1974-75 criminal business accounts for just over 50 per cent of legal aid expenditure. This rises to about 60 per cent by 1978-79.8. Scottish expenditure is expected to rise by only about 2i per cent over the Survey period.Treatment of offendersPrisons9. The main assumption is that the total number of persons heldin prison will rise from 41,700 in 1974-75 to 45,800 by 1978-79. This re-vised forecast takes account, among other things, of the continuing tend-ency of the courts to award non-custodial sentences to an increasing proportion of offenders.10. The total number of non-industrial staff is expected to rise by,500. Provision is made for the continued use of probation officers and supporting staff for welfare work in prisons and training borstals in Englandand Wales. It is expected that about 420 probation officers will be so employed in 1974-75 rising to 490 in 1978-79, a rather slower rate of growth than that previously envisaged. A gradual increase is also expected in the number of local authority social workers employed in prisons inScotland.11. The capital programme has been reviewed in the light of the ex-pected size of the prison population and of the resources which can bemade available. It is now expected that the number of prison places will increase by some 6,800 during the 5 year period. The total number of places available would then come near the expected number required (butsee explanatory note to Table B following paragraph 24). The programme
also allows for a modest start to be made on the replacement of some out-dated Victorian buildings and hutted camps, by new establishments or byredevelopment on existing sites.12. Expenditure on staff quarters and on schemes to improve facilities at existing establishments (for example workshops and visiting rooms) isexpected to average some  17 million a year. The estimated expenditureincludes the cost of providing about 3,300 new staff quarters, including those to be provided at new establishments.Probation and after-care13. The principal assumption for England and Wales is that the num-ber of probation officers will rise from 4,180 to 5,640 over the period.These figures reflect recently improved recruitment and reduced wastage.Following local government reorganisation the number of community serv-ice schemes will be reduced to 50 compared with 78 previously forecast.They will however cover the same areas at the same cost. The programmemakes provision for an additional 1.600 places in adult hostels and bailhostels (1,800 in Cmnd 5519) and for an expansion of the day trainingcentres scheme from the 4 at present operating to about 20 by the end ofthe period. It is expected that voluntary organisations will provide anadditional 240 after-care hostel places each year (an increase of 40 a year on last year&apos;s estimate).14. In Scotland, probation and after-care are provided for in the health and Personal Social Services Programme.General protective servicesPolice15. The aim of the programme is to provide an adequate and efficientpolice force by building up police strengths and improving facilities fortraining and scientific and technical support. The estimates assume a growth in police strength from 112.225 to 122,750 compared with a growth ofabout 10,300 in the previous five years. The projected increase of 10.525(rather lower than that assumed in Cmnd 5519) is a more realistic estimatereflecting recent trends in recruitment and wastage; it does not imply that any lower priority is to be given to strengthening the police. Shouldthe increase exceed these estimates, provision will be made for additional expenditure within authorised establishments.16. During the period the number of civilians is expected to increase from 44,680 to 52,830 which includes provision for an additional 4,430traffic wardens. These estimates, lower than those previously forecast, alsoreflect recent recruitment trends.17. Compared with Cmnd 5519 the estimates for capital expenditureon sites and operational buildings have been reduced by spreading forward the building programme over a longer period. Starts on some headquarters and other operational buildings will be delayed, in some cases to datesbeyond the present Survey period. Provision is made for replacing someforensic science laboratories and police training centres but on a reduced scale. The planned expansion of the Police Colleges will proceed and con-tinued provision is made for the Police National Computer.
Fire services18. The estimates assume an increase over the period in the numberof whole-time firemen from 30,550 to 34,500. These numbers include theadditional manpower required for the introduction of the 48 hour week in November 1974. Civilian staff are expected to rise from 5,165 to 5,950;retained (part-time) and junior firemen are expected to remain at 16,400and 150 respectively throughout the period.19. Capital expenditure including provision for improving local facili-ties for training recruits has been reduced by comparison with Cmnd 5519.This will have the effect of deferring parts of the programme by up to two years.20. The effects of the Fire Precautions (Loans) Act 1973 are estimatedat  2.0 million for 1974-75, but are expected to fall to  0.3 million by theend of the period.Other21. This programme covers control of immigration, the cost of the immigration Appeals Tribunal and the Immigrants Advisory Service. Theincrease over the period reflects the cost of additional staff to deal withthe expected continuing increase in work in accordance with the currenttrend.Community services22. The estimates show an increase of 38 per cent over the period.There are two main reasons for this: first the increase in expenditure onthe Urban Programme which is expected to rise from  18.7 million in1974-75 to  24.0 million in 1978-79; secondly, provision for the establish-ment of the Equal Opportunities Commission amounting to  1.5 million in1975-76 rising to  3.0 million in 1976-77 and later years.23. The remainder of the provision is mainly for grants by the home departments to statutory and voluntary bodies. The total leyel of grants to voluntary bodies remains unaltered since Cmnd 5519. Responsibility forthe Voluntary Services Unit has been transferred from the Lord privy seal to the Home Secretary.Other informationTreatment of offenders24. Table B provides a simple framework within which the alloca-tion of resources to the prison service may be related to the planned useof these resources and their projected outputs! Other information of anon-financial character is published in the annual reports of the work ofthe Prison Services, reports on the work of the Probation and After-CareService and the annual reports of HM Chief Inspectors of the Police and fire Services.

In establishments which have to accept people committed to custody, ie local prisonsand remand centres, a proportion of the available places must be kept in reserve to accommodate fluctuating and unpredictable numbers remanded by the courts. Experi-ence suggests that in such establishments a margin of places of at least 5 per cent inexcess of uncrowded capacity is desirable.The increasing specialisation of training establishments means that there is less oppor-tunity to transfer inmates from one type of establishment to another, or examplevacancies in open prisons cannot be filled by prisoners who are unsuitable for openconditions. Neither is it generally possible to transfer young offenders particularly those under 17 to other types of training establishments which may have vacancies.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE25. The main policy changes since Cmnd 5519 are the reductions madeas a result of the general measures announced by the last Government on17 December 1973; and of the further review of public expenditure by thepresent Government, together with the addition of provision for the EqualOpportunities Commission.26. The main estimating changes are that provision is made for as lower rate of increase in police strengths, a reduced police building programme, a revised prison building programme and increased provisionfor the cost of legal aid.

The Government&apos;s plans for education expenditure envisage aprospective growth between 1974-75 and 1978-79 of  482 million, repre-senting an annual average growth of 2.7 per cent.2. The demand for education in the coming years is now forecast to grow at a slower rate than was expected 12 months ago. There are several reasons for this change. First, the birth-rate projections are lower. Secondly,the latest evidence shows that earlier forecasts of the number of childrenstaying on at school beyond the statutory school leaving age were too high. Thirdly, the number of pupils qualified to enter higher education is now expected to increase less rapidly than in earlier projections and, ofthose who are qualified, fewer seem likely now to enter it so that the con-tinuing expansion of higher education will be at a slower rate.3. These demographic and related changes reduce the forecasts ofexpenditure which are directly related to pupil and student numbers. Thuswithin a growth rate of 2.7 per cent a year it is possible to provide for thecontinued development of nursery education, for some improvement and re-placement of school buildings and for a substantial special school building programme. But these changes also give rise to problems of future planningsince their incidence on different institutions of higher education will require futher examination and will be the subject of consultations with those re-sponsible for planning the institutions. Similarly, consultation with local

The following Table shows the forecasts of the number of pupilsand students underlying the expenditure projections in Table 2.10 above.Thousands1974-75    1975-76    1976-77    1977-7!Schools (i)Under fives (2)   .........: Primary pupils.........Secondary pupils to age 16Over 16   ............Non-advanced further education (3)Higher education (4)0) Estimates for January in the relevant year.(2) The figures, which cover nursery pupils and pupils in primary schools, take account of the proportionate demand on facilities of part-time pupils and are expressed as full-time equivalents.       ,(3) The figures are estimated for the academic year beginning in the relevantfinancial year and are expressed as full-time equivalents of students undertaking non-advanced level work at establishments of further education.O The figures are estimated for the academic year beginning in the relevantfinancial year. They take into account full-time students at universities, full-timeequivalents of students and serving teachers undertaking advanced level work atpolytechnics and other establishments of further education. For technical reasons,the numbers of students in higher education and in further education in this tableare not classified in the same way as expenditure in these sectors in Table 2.10.5. The current expenditure forecasts shown in the Table above for1975-76 reflect the Governmenfs decision to seek considerable restraint
in local authority expenditure during that year, as demonstrated by therecent rate support grant settlements for that year. The detailed con-sequences of these settlements for the education service were set out inthe joint circular by DOE and other Government Departments concerned,DES Circular 12/74. A separate Scottish Office Circular will be issuedshortly. The forecasts for subsequent years take account of the Govern-ment&apos;s declared intention to continue to restrain the growth of localauthority expenditure.Schools6. The prospective numbers of under-fives and of primary pupils are affected by the lower birth-rate projections. The numbers of under-fivesshown in the Table, as the footnote explains, are full-time equivalents. Thegrowth in places for under-fives in England and Wales is broadly consistent,as far as numbers are concerned, with the policy in Cmnd 5174 that thereshould be provision for 90 per cent of 4-year-olds and 50 per cent of3-year-olds by 1981-82. In Scotland too the growth is consistent with thepolicy in Cmnd 5175 that places should be provided to meet the expectedpublic demand by 1982-83.7. Primary pupil numbers show a more marked decline than thecorresponding projection in Cmnd 5519. The forecast number of secondarypupils up to the age of 16 continues to rise slowly in line with the forecast in Cmnd 5519. The projected rate of growth of those over 16 has, however,been reduced to reflect the lower observed trends (see paragraph 2 above).8. The capital programmes for the under-fives provide for the con-tinued expansion in the number of places in nursery education, either by new building or by adapting surplus places in primary schools (whichwill form an increasing proportion of the total number of places availablefor the under-fives in England and Wales). For primary and secondary schools provision is made for the necessary new places to ensure thatall children can be accommodated and there is a continuing programme for the replacement and improvement of old schools. Substantial capitalprovision is made for special schools and units to meet the need for additional places and to improve unsatisfactory accommodation.9. The Government is currently reviewing its teacher supply policy inEngland and Wales in the light of the continuing fall in the number of births. The figures in the programme will need to be revised in the lightof decisions taken as a result of that review. Factors which must be takeninto consideration include the time-lag in securing reductions in the outputof the colleges of education, the need to keep a sound teacher trainingsystem in being, changes in wastage rates and the need to find room for valuable older recruits, including married women returning to the teaching profession. Meanwhile a small reduction has been made inthe number of teachers previously assumed to be employed in 1978-79. InScotland the programme provides for the achievement and maintenance ofthe staffing standards assumed in Cmnd 5175.Further education10. In non-advanced further education, which includes the importantgroup of young people between 16 and 19 following vocational courses ofmany kinds, the statistics point to a rising trend in numbers for which
provision has been made, both in current expenditure and in prospectivecapital programmes.Higher education11. As the Government announced in the House of Commons on 25November 1974, the upward trend in the number of students qualifying for and entering higher education has slowed down in the past two years.In consequence the plans for the expansion of higher education now rest ona revised planning figure of 640,000 full-time and sandwich students in GreatBritain in 1981, which replaces the planning figure of 750,000 assumed in cmnd 5519. The revised figure maintains the Robbins principle thatcourses of higher education should be available to all those who are quali-fied by ability and attainment to pursue them and who wish to do so. Thebuilding programmes which are planned for the next few years shouldsupplement the existing teaching accommodation to the extent necessaryto provide for 640,000 students in 1981. Provision is also made for some additional student residence. The implications of the revision of the esti-mated demand for places by 1981, for all institutions providing higher edu-cation, are being discussed with the responsible authorities and the outcome of these discussions may require some modification within the programmes.School meals12. The estimates take account of the decision, announced in Parlia-ment on 16 December 1974, that the price of the school meal will rise from12p to 15p on 1 April 1975. The present charge has been in force since1 April 1971 and at that time the subsidy from public funds representedabout 37 per cent of the total cost of the meal. By April 1974 the subsidyhad risen to about 56 per cent and since then it has risen further. Theincrease in the charge to 15p is expected to reduce the subsidy to aboutthe same level as in April 1974. When the charge is raised an adjustmentwill be made to the income scales used for assessing eligibility for freeschool meals. The estimates also assume that the price of the school mealwill be increased annually in 1976 and thereafter in order to maintain thesubsidy at a broadly constant proportion of the total cost.Research councils etc13. The forecasts for Research Councils, etc, represent expenditurecollectively known as the Science Budget, for which the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science is responsible. It relates to expenditure by thefive Research Councils (Agricultural, Medical, Natural Environment, Sci-ence, and Social Science), the British Museum (Natural History) and agrant-in-aid to the Royal Society for scientific purposes. The Secretary ofState is advised on its allocations by the Advisory Board for the research councils. The Science Budget was allocated in 1974-75 Estimates asfollows:Agricultural Research CouncilMedical Research Council    ......Natural Environment Research CouncilScience Research Council    ......Social Science Research CouncilNatural History Museum*   ......Royal Society............  million15-126116183-56-82-61-5Total151-7* Includes provision for major building.
14. The figures for 1974-75 and 1975-76 reflect the decision announ-ced in the 1972 White Paper &quot;Framework for Government R&amp;D (Cmnd5046) to transfer certain sums phased over three years starting in 1973-74,from the Science Budget to customer departments for the purpose ofcommissioning applied research. 1975-76 is the last year of this transitional period.15. The purpose of the research financed from the Science Budget isto develop the sciences as such, to maintain a fundamental capacity for research and to support higher education. It covers a wide spectrum of activity, ranging from investigation of human and animal health and be-haviour through the causes of, and cures for pollution, to the mapping ofearth, sea and sky and the investigation of the laws of physical matter.16. The distribution of expenditure between different types of activityvaries from one Research Council to another, as Table A illustrates.17. A major part of the expenditure of the Agricultural, Medical and natural Environment Research Councils is incurred on the maintenanceof research establishments and units to provide a fundamental researchcapability, to meet the needs of customer departments for applied research,and to advance the standard of scientific excellence in specific fields. Inthe case of the Science and Social Science Research Councils, a larger proportion of their budget is expended on support for universities, inclu-ding the provision of postgraduate awards. The Science Research Council&apos;expenditure on international research centres such as CERN, provides cen-tral facilities for the use of university research workers, especially in fieldssuch as nuclear physics and astronomy, which call for heavy expenditureon plant and equipment.18. The provision for Research Council expenditure for 1974-75 on-wards includes an element for the relocation of the headquarters of the science and Natural Environmental Research Councils in a building to be constructed in Swindon.Arts19. Provision for current expenditure by the national museums and galleries caters for the maintenance of, and additions to, the collections andfor the manning of extensions due for completion in this period.20. Provision for current expenditure on the Arts Council and otherarts includes provision from 1977-78 for the proposed introduction of aPublic Lending Right, which will be dependent on legislation.21. In each of the years 1973-74 and 1974-75, a special allocation of 1 million was made for expenditure on arts in the regions, particularlyin the assisted areas. From this allocation additions of  0 07 million and 0-01 million were made to the provisions for current expenditure of the arts Council and British Film Institute.22. The British Film Institute continues to help with the developmentof film theatres (often in collaboration with the Regional Arts associations and in association with the Arts Council) and to maintain and improve

the National Film Archive. The National Film School is now in its fourthfull academic year with 75 students.23. Provision of  0.4 million a year is made for the Crafts. The grant for 1974-75 included additional provision to enable the Crafts AdvisoryCommittee to examine the crafts related to conservation and to suggestways of encouraging the skills essential to this work.24. Capital provision continues to be made for assistance by the arts council and the British Film Institute towards Housing the Arts and Hous-ing the Cinema. Since the introduction of the scheme for Housing the Arts217 projects have benefitted or been promised support. The total cost ofthese projects (actual and estimated) is  34-5 million, of which the arts council&apos;s contribution is  5-8 million.25.  The figure for capital expenditure in 1974-75 is substantially higherthan in later years, primarily because of the provision for purchase of a.site for the possible extension at a future date of the Royal Opera House,Covent Garden.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE26. The reduction in the programme for 1974-75 compared with Cmnd5519 was part of the general reduction in public expenditure announced by the former Administration on 17 December 1973. The reductions inthe programmes for subsequent years show the effect of the downwardrevision in demographic and other forecasts on different parts of the educa-tion service, as explained in paragraphs 2-11 above.

1. The only significant change in the scope of the programme comparedwith Cmnd 5519 is the inclusion of expenditure on school health services(previously in the &quot;Education&quot; programme). Local authority health services were also transferred to the new health authorities on 1 April 1974 andthe relevant expenditure is now shown under the heading &quot;Hospitals and community health services&quot;.2. The aim of the programme is to provide, within the resources avail-able, health and personal social services for the whole population, withparticular emphasis on helping people who have special needs, such as the elderly, the mentally ill and handicapped and the young. The reorganisation of the NHS on an integrated basis on 1 April 1974 and the developmentof closer collaboration between the NHS and local authority personal social services will enable better use to be made of available resources and will facilitate the planning of complementary and interdependent services.Further efforts will be made to reduce the inequalities in standards of service which exist between different areas, to ensure that the services availablein any area are more closely related to its particular needs and to work towards a widening of the range of services throughout the whole country.As in most other countries, there are constantly rising expectations aboutthe quality and quantity of health and social care and pressures to do more whenever resources permit. New developments in the provision of care, such as the primary health care teams working in the growing numberof health centres and elsewhere, and new methods of providing support and assistance will continue to be encouraged.
3. Expenditure is planned to grow in real terms (excluding the rela-tive price effect) over the period 1974-75 to 1978-79 at an average of 2.per cent a year.Hospitals and community health services4. Provision has been made for expenditure of  303 million in 1975-76,including a special increase for that year which brings the total to a figure 22 million above that for 1974-75, and this will enable a limited numberof substantial new building schemes to go ahead. Top priority will be givento capital facilities for primary care and there will be increased expenditurein 1975-76 on health centres. Present levels of capital expenditure will bemaintained in the geriatric, mental illness and mental handicap fields.Everything possible will be done to ensure that capital schemes vital for medical training are not affected. Provision has been made for a modestamount of capital expenditure to be directed specifically at reducing waitinglists.5. The provision for capital expenditure over the remaining years to1978-79 is lower than in 1975-76. The capital programme for these years will therefore be reviewed urgently in consultation with the health autho-rities to determine the most effective strategy for deploying the available resources. Many important schemes which it had been planned to start inthese years will have to be deferred; and many schemes are likely to haveto be significantly modified in the light of the review which is to takeplace.6. Current expenditure on hospital and community health services willcontinue to grow in real terms at about 2.7 per cent a1 year from 1974-75to 1978-79. Part of the annual growth is needed to provide services forthe growing and ageing population and to meet the additional running costs of new hospitals and other facilities.7. The number of hospital in-patients treated rose from 5.8 million in 1968 to 6.3 million in 1973 and it is expected that the number of in-patients will increase in the period up to 1978-79. The provision of particular services will reflect new patterns of care for example, the annual totalof psychiatric day patients has grown at 13.2 per cent a year since 1968-69.Further information on the scale and scope of health services can be foundin the annual publications &quot;Health and Personal Social Services Statistics&quot;for England and Wales, in the Annual Reports of the Department of health and Social Security, Scottish Home and Health Department, and the welsh office and the Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer of the Depart-ment of Health and Social Security.Family practitioner services. Primary care is provided through contractual arrangements withthe practitioners taking part in the general medical, dental and ophthalmicservices and the pharmaceutical service. These services will play an increas-ing role in the reorganised NHS as more progress is made in switching fromin-patient treatment to care in the community. More opportunities willoccur in the reorganised service for the family practitioners to be involvedin the development of a total health care plan for the areas in which theyoperate. The forecasts of increasing expenditure reflect the expectation that
there will be both greater demand on the services and more manpower tomeet the demand.9.   The extent to which the various services are used at present is illustrated by the following figures for 1973-74:Patients on doctors&apos; lists 56 millionPrescriptions dispensed 313 millionDental Treatments (courses and emergencies) 27 millionSight Tests 8 millionGlasses dispensed with NHS lenses 5 million.10. The number of general medical practitioners, 25,000 at 1 October1973, has been increasing at the rate of about li per cent a year and theaverage number of patients on each list has dropped from 2,450 in 1969to 2,350 in 1973. The number of prescriptions dispensed, corrected for exceptional factors like influenza outbreaks, rises at the rate of about 7 million a year. Dental treatments have been increasing at about li million a year and the upward trend is expected to continue, though at a reduced rate. The number of dentists, 13,000 at 1 October 1973, is increasing atthe rate of some 200 a year and this trend is expected to continue as thebenefit is obtained of the increased number of places in dental schools.Personal social services11. The personal social services capital programme provides primarily for building new, and improving existing, residential accommodation and dayfacilities for the elderly, the physically or mentally handicapped, the mentally ill and children in care. Because of the economic constraints annual expen-diture will be held broadly at the level planned for 1974-75. This should enable some 5,000 residential and 5,000 day places to be provided eachyear. Within this programme special attention will be given to developingresidential provision, including provision of secure accommodation, for child-ren in care and to restoring the rate of development of the programme of provision for the mentally handicapped to the level set out in the white paper for England and Wales &quot;Better Services for the Mentally Handi-capped&quot; (Cmnd 4683) whose principles also apply in Scotland. From 1975-76local authorities will have greater freedom to decide their Own priorities in the light of general guidance from the Secretaries of State on national policy objectives and minimum standards but within the overall constraintson resources imposed by the general economic state of the country.12. The current expenditure programme provides for the running costs of residential homes and day centres and for field social work and domi-ciliary support services, including aids and adaptations for the physicallyhandicapped. It also covers probation and after-care in Scotland. In common with other local authority services, the forecast for 1975-76, which reflects the Governments decision to seek considerable restraint in that year, isintended to cover only the increase due to inescapable commitments. Thefigures for later years provide for very little further growth. Local authori-ties have been given guidance on the priorities for using the limited resources available.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE13. Immediately following the publication of last year&apos;s White Paper,the then Government announced a widespread series of cuts in public
expenditure planned for 1974-75 including the following in the health and personal social services programme:Health:capitalcurrentPSS:capitalcurrentCentral and Miscellaneous:capitalcurrentTotal  million70-534-319-311-2012-4137-814. Policy changes made since 1 March 1974, for which additional funds have been provided, include:.1. a.   a payment of  5 million in 1974-75 to the Thalidomide Trustto offset the effects of taxation on income from the Trust;b.  a further payment of  3 million to the Rowntree MemorialTrust to provide help for very severely handicapped children;2. the decision not to raise dental and optical charges when payments to the practitioners were increased in 1974;3. the introduction of a new mobility allowance for certain disabledpeople at a cost of  4 million in 1975-76 rising to  15 million in1978-79.15. Other changes consist mainly of revised forecasts of the costof former local authority health services which were transferred to the nhs on 1 April 1974.

The general pattern of expenditure as between the various social security benefits is broadly similar to that in Cmnd 5519. Retirement pen-sions are the largest single item and account for about half the expenditure.Other contributory benefits account for between a fifth and a quarter, andthe balance is made up by the non-contributory benefits (principally supple-mentary benefit, family allowances, war pensions, attendance allowance andthe new non-contributory invalidity pension) and administration and miscel-laneous services (which account for approximately 4 per cent of the total).2. In Cmnd 5519 and previous White Papers benefit expenditure infuture years has not reflected changes which may be made later, but whichhave not yet been announced. It has been based on the latest known ratesof benefit at the time the White Paper was published. That approach wouldnot be appropriate now for two reasons. First the Government is nowcommitted to raising the main pension benefits in line with earnings and

This commitment entailsplanning for extra expenditure on improving pensions in real terms. Secondlyon this occasion an uprating of benefits (including family allowances) hasbeen announced but is not due to take effect until April 1975. Cash figuresreflecting these rates of benefit would greatly overstate the level of expen-diture compared with the figures at 1974 survey prices which are usedelsewhere in the White Paper.3, In this White Paper the figures for future years are given in termsof the average levels of benefit in force during 1974-75.* That is equivalentto assuming that benefits are uprated just enough to offset the increase inprices on average over each year. This approach makes it possible to show* In the case of the new disability benefits (see paragraph 10(iv)) this means theaverage rate of the benefits to which they are aligned.

However, a single line of round figures is included in Table 2.12 togive a broad indication of what might be needed to cover the real improve-ments, compared with the 1974-75 level, resulting in 1975-76 and the restof the Survey period from the upratings in July 1974 and later. The realincrease in pensions in July 1974 is partly reflected in the average rateof benefit for 1974-75 and the balance in the separate line for upratingimprovements. This line also includes the real improvement which maybe expected, compared with 1974-75, from the increase in family allowances in April 1975.4. For consistency with the above presentation the figures for 1969-70to 1973-74 have been revalued to 1974 Survey prices instead of being left,as in Cmnd 5519, at outturn prices.Numbers of beneficiaries5. The table above shows the estimated average numbers receiving themain benefits, on which the expenditure figures in Table 2.12 are based.The estimated numbers of retirement pensioners reflect the continuingincrease in the number of people over pensionable age. It is assumed that thewell-established trend towards earlier retirement will continue. The numbers for attendance allowance from 1973-74 onwards have been reduced by com-parison with those given in Cmnd 5519 because the numbers qualifying for the lower rate of allowance have turned out to be smaller than expected.The numbers for supplementary pensions take account of an estimated

The family allow-ance increase will reduce the amount of supplement payable to families with two or more children. This factor accounts for a reduction of  1 million in expenditure in 1976-77 and later years.6. Even though there was no influenza epidemic in the past year, claimrates for both sickness benefit and invalidity benefit have followed the upward trend which had begun to show itself at the time of Cmnd 5519.This increase may prove to be temporary but, in estimating future numbers for both benefits, claim rates have been assumed which allow for the con-continuation of the trend up to the level of the peak rates recorded in 1969-70.As noted in Cmnd 5519, this increase is to some extent offset by the forecastchanges in the composition of the insured population.7. It will be noted that the estimated numbers for invalidity benefit arehigher than those given in Cmnd 5519 and those for sickness benefit arecorrespondingly lower. This adjustment reflects the fuller statistics whichhave become available since Cmnd 5519 about the division of sicknessexperience between long-term and short-term.CHANGES IN EXPENDITUREIncreases and improvements8. One of the first decisions of the new Government in March wasto bring the 1974 general uprating of benefits forward from the autumn to july. The standard single rate of retirement pension was increased from
 7.75 to  10 and the standard single rate of unemployment and sickness benefit from  7.35 to  8.60. Corresponding improvements were made inrelated benefits. The increase in the pension represented a real improve-ment of about 13i per cent over the rate established in October 1973.Benefits are to be increased again in April 1975, to  11.60 for the retire-ment pension and  9.80 for unemployment and sickness benefit. Therewill be another uprating in December 1975. It is the Governmenfs inten-tion to return to an annual cycle of upratings thereafter as inflation is brought under control.9. Family allowances are to be increased in April 1975, the first increasein this benefit since 1968. The rates of allowance, at present 90p for thesecond child in the family and  1 for the third and each subsequent child,will go up by 60p and 50p respectively to provide a uniform rate of  1.50,with consequential adjustment to the amounts of national insurance depen-dency benefit and supplementary benefit for children. The figures in Table2.12 and elsewhere in this White Paper do not allow for the cost of a child benefit scheme for all children, including the first in each family,to which the Government is committed, but the timing and other provisionsof which have not yet been announced. Additional expenditure on thisscheme would be a charge on the contingency reserve.10.  There have been a number of other changes since Cmnd 5519.i. The qualifying income levels for family income supplement andthe maximum amounts of benefit were increased in July 1974.This change would have increased expenditure if rising earningshad not reduced the numbers claiming.ii. Special lump-sum payments of  10 were made in November 1974to retirement pensioners and others over minimum pension agewith comparable benefits and also to those under pension agereceiving widow&apos;s benefit, attendance allowance, invalidity benefit or unemployability supplement or allowance. This adds  92 million to expenditure in 1974-75.iii. The amounts of income and capital disregarded for the purposeof assessing title to supplementary benefit are to be increased. Thisadds  13 million to expenditure in a full year.iv. Two new benefits are being introduced: a non-contributoryinvalidity pension for chronically sick people unable to work who do not qualify for the contributory invalidity pension; and aninvalid care allowance for those (other than married women livingwith or maintained by their husbands) who are prevented fromworking by the need to look after a disabled person who qualifiesfor attendance allowance. The gross costs at 1974 Survey prices are estimated to be about  57 million a year for non-contributoryinvalidity pension and about  5 million a year for invalid careallowance. There will be offsetting reductions of about  53 million a reduction of about  2 million in expenditure from the funds of hospital authorities and the rest a reduction in expenditure on supplementary benefit. All these figures are approximate since thenumbers of those who will qualify are necessarily somewhat speculation-lative at this stage. It is hoped to start payment of non-contributoryinvalidity pension in August 1975 and of invalid care allowance in
the autumn of 1976. Non-contributory invalidity pension will notbe available at the outset to married women dependent on their husbands but will be extended to them after the other improve-ments are under way. The cost of this extension will be a charge on the contingency reserve.11. Better Pensions (Cmnd 5713), published in September 1974, setout the Governmenfs proposals for a new pension scheme whereby the retirement pension and other long-term benefits would become fullyearnings-related. The Government intends to introduce a Bill early in 1975to give effect to these proposals, with the aim that the new scheme should start not later than April 1978. On this basis extra expenditure of  28million in 1978-79 is included in Table 2.12, attributed to the appropriatebenefits.Other changes12. The other changes in comparison, with Cmnd 5519 derive fromchanged assumptions about the numbers of beneficiaries in the light ofthe latest information.

Increases are needed in Inland Revenue staff for changesin policy relating to income tax; in later years the estimates include in-creases for the earnings related national insurance scheme.Other financial administration2. The net costs of the Department for National Savings fell from about  28 million in 1975-76 to about  20 million in 1978-79, reflectingthe withdrawal of the National Savings Stamp by 1976-77. Also includedare the Treasury, the Royal Mint, and certain costs incurred by the Bankof England including the note issue, the management of the national debt and the Bank of England&apos;s capital expenditure.Records, registrations and surveys3. This includes expenditure by several Government Departments(the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, the General RegisterOffice (Scotland), Land Registry, Ordnance Survey, and other minor De-partments) and some local authority expenditure. Provision is made underthe Office of Population Censuses and Surveys for social surveys carriedout as an allied service for Government Departments. Provision is included under the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and the GeneralRegister Office (Scotland) for a 100 per cent census of population in 1976at an estimated cost of  21 million.

Expenditure covers the capital requirements of the British Broad-casting Corporation (BBC) Home Services and the Independent Broad-casting Authority (IBA). These bodies are co-ordinating separately financedprogrammes for the construction of 625-line UHF (Ultra-High Frequency)stations to transmit all BBC and IBA television services, ultimately re-placing VHF (Very-High Frequency) stations which do not transmit colouror bbc programmes. The aim is to increase the present coverage of about94 per cent attained by the UHF stations to about 98 per cent by the endof 1979. The BBCs expenditure (capital and current) is financed by Govern-ment grant which at present consists of the whole of the net licence revenue. The IBA provides transmitters to broadcast the programmes of independent television and independent local radio companies and is finan-ced by the rentals charged to the companies. The Independent broadcasting authority Act 1973 also provides for the IBA to draw up to  2 million on loan for financing the independent local radio services.Other services. The largest single item in this programme is the capital investment programme of Cable and Wireless Limited amounting to  100 million forthe five years to 1978-79, most of which is abroad. The company, whoseshares are wholly owned by the Government, is run as a commercialenterprise and its investment is financed from profits and borrowing otherthan from the Government. Its principal activity is the provision of inter-national communications and internal telephone systems in a number of countries, and it is an important link in the Commonwealth telecommunications-tions network.
CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE6. On broadcasting, although cuts have been made since Cmnd 5519as part of general restrictions on public expenditure, the planned UHFtransmitter construction programme will be continued at the level envis-aged in last year&apos;s White Paper. Additional provision will be required fora fourth channel in Wales recommended in the report of the Committeeon Broadcasting Coverage (Cmnd 5774) and accepted in principle by theGovernment.1

This programme consists mainly of expenditure on offices for theHome Civil Service, though it also includes for example some expenditure for furnishing and running costs on specialised accommodation like re-search establishments. The expenditure on offices is mainly determined bythe area of office space which has to be provided to meet the needs of theservices concerned. &apos;2. Capital expenditure covers both the cost of providing new Crown-owned office building and other items, including the cost of taking occupa-tion of newly leased premises and the cost of work to prevent deterioration of the existing estate or to improve sub-standard working conditions. Roughlyhalf of the total is expected to relate to building and furnishing new Crown-owned offices. The increase in the area of Crown-owned offices up to 1978relates mainly to schemes already in progress, since expenditure on majorbuilding projects is spread over a period of several years before occupation.3. The total area of office space has increased since 1969 and is currently planned to increase up to 1978 as follows:OFFICE AND GENERAL ACCOMMODATION SERVICESMillions of square feet	Crown-owned		Leased		Total	London	Elsewhere	London	Elsewhere	1969      ......	6-3	15-3	13-1	14-2	49-01970     ......	6-4	15-1	13-8	15-0	50-31971      ......	6-6	15-5	13-7	16-4	52-11972      ......	6-7	15-8	13-9	17-8	54-21973      ......	6-7	16-3	14-2	18-5	55-71974     ......	6-7	16-4	14-4	19-5	57-01975     ......	6-7	16-7	14-8	21-3	59-51976     ......	6-7	17-3	14-5	22-1	60-61977     ......	6-8	18-0	14-2	22-3	61-31978     ......	6-8	18-5	13-8	22-5	61-6Figures show the areas at December each year; those for 1974 and later years are estimates.

The expected need for extra space in the period to 1978 cannotbe met entirely from the planned building programme and the amountof leased space, which already accounts for nearly three-fifths of the total,is forecast to increase in this period, and this is reflected in the forecastincrease in expenditure on rents. The forecasts of rent show only the costof hiring additional space at current market levels with no increase in thecost of the existing estate. In money terms, the rent bill will rise morethan shown, irrespective of any increases in current market levels, because some of the leases in the existing estate will be subject to rent reviews,renewals or replacement before 1979. Because of the difference betweenthe average rent level of the existing estate and the level of current rentsfor new hirings taken in 1974-75 and later years the percentage increase inthe rent bill forecast for these years is greater than the forecast increasein the area leased; the rent bill for 1974-75 however is lower than originallyexpected as a result of delays in obtaining accommodation.Stationery and printing (home)5. HMSO is the central source of supply for government departments for their printing, stationery and office machinery: it also supplies someother public sector bodies on repayment. HMSO is also responsible forthe printing, and in most instances, the publication, distribution, and saleof government publications on which the annual turnover is approximately 8-0 million.Computers and telecommunications6. The role of the Central Computer Agency (CCA) is to promote the use of computers in Government in order to improve administrativeefficiency and to widen policy choices. It advises departments on theirautomatic data processing projects and provides them with purchasingand other executive services. It is also responsible for policy on and financial
control of telecommunications used in Government for civil administrativepurposes. The programme covers expenditure on the acquisition of adminis-trative computers, the hire of computer time from commercial bureauxand the maintenance of equipment together with expenditure on CCAstaff and on development studies. Expenditure on equipment for scientific and operational computer systems is provided on other programmes, notably the Defence programme.Home publicity7. This covers expenditure on publicity campaigns which are carriedout by the Central Office of Information and Scottish Office for other government Departments and includes the related printing costs on her majesty&apos;s Stationery Office Vote. Publicity is directed principally at audit-ences in the United Kingdom through the media of press and televisionadvertising, films, exhibitions and publications in support of departmentalpolicies. The sums will provide for Government publicity to assist recruit-ment (mainly to the Armed Forces), and to inform the public for exampleabout road safety or available social or other benefits.Civil superannuation8. The present forecasts which are higher than in Cmnd 5519, take account of experience with the working of the civil service pension schemeintroduced in 1972.Other common services9. This programme covers the cost of legal services, the government actuary, Civil Service Catering Services and Transport Services.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE10. The main changes since Cmnd 5519 are due to the reductions in public spending in 1974-75 announced by the then Chancellor of the Ex-chequer on 17 December 1973, and similar reductions for the years 1975-76to 1978-79 made subsequently. Most of the reductions have fallen on thecapital programme, since existing commitments make it difficult to achievesavings on rents or maintenance. This has led to consequential reductions in Departmental Administration forecasts due to reductions in the amountof design work to be done in the period.11. The policy changes include the cuts on 1974-75 expenditure, an allowance for the consequences of the Governments new dispersal pro-gramme and an extra  5 million of capital expenditure in 1975-76: as part ofthe measures announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 11 Sept-ember 1974 to assist the construction industry. The allowance for dispersalincludes a start on construction work in 1975-76 and on leasing premises in dispersal locations; there will be a reduction in London rents as staff are moved to these locations and allowing for this, the extra cost ofdispersal within the period covered by the forecasts is initially estimatedat  16-5 million. The extra  5 million to assist the construction industry will be spent on improving sub-standard offices.12. The other changes in 1974-75 are due to expenditure on rents beingsubstantially less than forecast (mainly because of delays in obtaining
accommodation) and to shorfalls on other items including furniture (causedby supply problems) and fuel (due to economies). In later years the other changes are mainly due to reductions in the levels of expenditure following the cuts applied to 1974-75.

The division of Table 2.15 into parts A and B reflects the divisionof responsibility for Northern Ireland expenditure between Northern IrelandDepartments and United Kingdom Departments following the transfer of services provided for in the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973. Thistook effect on 1 January 1974. The same division of responsibility continuesunder the interim constitutional arrangements introduced by the NorthernIreland Act 1974 but the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is directly responsible to Parliament at present for the expenditure of the NorthernIreland Departments as well as for that of the Northern Ireland Office.2. In earlier White Papers Table 2.3 covered agricultural support pay-ments in Northern Ireland borne by the United Kingdom Ministry of Agri-culture, Fisheries and Food. These payments are now included in Part b of Table 2.15, so that Parts A and B together represent almost the full extent of public expenditure relating specifically to Northern Ireland. Thecost of food subsidies and price guarantees for milk and wool for the UnitedKingdom as a whole remains in Table 2.3, and Northern Ireland&apos;s shareof this in 1974-75 is roughly estimated at  25 million.

The extra costs attributable to the Army&apos;stask in Northern Ireland are included within the figures in Table 2.1 andare likely to be of the order of  33 million in 1974-75. Tables 2.1 and 2.2cover defence costs generally and overseas services and relate of course to the UK as a whole.CHANGES IN EXPENDITURE3. The outturn in 1973-74 is lower than the forecast in Cmnd 5519revalued by some  61 million. The largest single shortfall is in the Trade,industry and employment programme. This reflects the influence exertedby the disturbances in Northern Ireland and by the generally&apos; lower up-takeof industrial investment aid in the UK as a whole. The effect of thesame factors together with the reorganisation of local government services may be seen in some smaller shortfalls, in new building and other pro-grammes.4. The following1 tables show the planning assumptions for the public sector of housing, and for the creation of jobs and the extent to whichachievement in 1973-74 has fallen short for the reasons indicated above.

The new forecasts for most programmes take some account of theeffects of continued disturbances in 1974-75 and allow thereafter for somehoped-for amelioration. Where necessary the forecasts have been recalcu-lated on a basis now considered to be more realistic than the basis usedfor Cmnd 5519. These recalculations follow a review of the services taken over by the Northern Ireland Departments from the local authorities, andof the services taken over by the Northern Ireland Office. Further measures in the field of social and economic planning have been under examination,but their financial implications have still to be assessed and are not reflected in the figures in Table 2.15.6. The policy additions to the forecasts for 1974-75 onwards result in large measure from the application to Northern Ireland of policy changesas agreed for the rest of the United Kingdom, for example additional sup-port to agriculture, changes in social security benefits and the continuanceand doubling of the Regional Employment Premium.7. The Secretary of State announced in September the expansion ofthe Royal Ulster Constabulary and The Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve.The Secretary of State has also announced the decision to construct a newpermanent prison; most of the expenditure on this will fall in the years1976-77 to 1979-80. A new temporary prison to provide immediate reliefhas also been approved.8. The estimating changes in 1974^75 include provision under the Law,order and protective services programme to cover the necessary immediaterebuilding and repairs which have had to be undertaken at the Maze andMagilligan prisons following the riots and destruction there last October.They also include under the same programme a very large increase in theamount of money now expected to be paid out to the public in the period as a whole in respect of compensation for criminal damage and injury.For the period 1974-75 to 1977-78 the total provision for such compensationhas been increased from  37 mijlion to  122 million, following a reassess-ment of the incidence of damage in the past and the present level of settle-ments. The present estimates assume that the volume of claims will diminishgradually from now onwards and that they will be settled more rapidly than was possible in the past.9. Estimating additions have been made to take account also of in-creased police overtime and of a near doubling in the number of prison
16.  CONTINGENCY RESERVE AND SHORTFALLTABLE 2.16   million in demand terms at 1974 Survey prices	1974-75    1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79Contingency reserve        .....	-           300	400	550	750General deduction for shortfall   ..	-300       -250	-250	-250	-250Contingency reserve the summary tables of total public expenditure (Tables 3.1 and 3.2)include a contingency reserve. This is intended to cover a number ofdifferent types of expenditure.2. First, not all the new policies announced by the Government havebeen developed to the point where cost estimates for each financial yearcan be determined with sufficient precision to include them in expenditure programmes. Second, the reserve is meant to cover the cost of expenditure which may need to be undertaken in pursuance of existing policies but which cannot yet be foreseen with any precision; and the net cost of any modifications in such policies which the Government may find it necessaryto introduce during the period. Third, it allows for the possibility that theGovernment will have to respond to some unpredictable events, such asnatural disasters in the U.K., which may arise during the period.3. The policies which are already known to involve a potential callon the contingency reserve include a number of proposals which mainlyinvolve the purchase of existing assets and therefore do not place a largedirect demand on current output of resources. Examples are the communityownership of development land, participation in private industry throughthe National Enterprise Board and the public ownership of certain in-dustries. Other new proposals, however, such as those for selective assist-ance to industry and other industrial support, including the activities ofthe Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, could involve a substantialresource cost. The improvements in family support envisaged in the childbenefit scheme also represent a future charge on the contingency reserve,the amount and timing of which cannot yet be accurately forecast.4. There is therefore, an unusually large difference, potentially, be-tween the demand content of some of the likely developments of policyin the next few years and their cost in money. Previous White Papers havegiven figures for the contingency reserve without distinguishing betweendemand on resources and cost in money. In this White Paper the figuresfor the contingency reserve express demand on resources. This implies that corresponding figures for the contingency reserve which expressed costin money would be higher to an extent that cannot be measured at thisstage except to say that the lower the demand content the greater thedifference.5. Setting the contingency reserve in demand terms does not mean,however, that large additional expenditures can necessarily be accom-accommodated in a particular year, simply because they have a low direct demandcontent. The indirect effects arising from the financing of such expenditure
will also need to be carefully considered. The rate at which the new policies such as those mentioned above can be developed, and their phasingin relation to each other, must pay full regard not only to their direct de-mand on resources, but also to their implications for the money supply,interest rates, and general financial conditions in the economy.General deduction for shortfall6. The tables also include a general deduction for shortfall, notallocated to particular programmes. This deduction is also expressed in demand terms.7. However carefully estimates and plans are made, it is often impossibleto guarantee that expenditure will follow them precisely. The incidence of the individual excesses and shortfalls has varied from year to year, butexperience has generally been that in total the under-spendings outweigh the over-spendings. One of the reasons for this is the unpredictable delaywhich can occur in some major capital projects. For this reason a specificshortfall deduction is also included within the nationalised industries&apos; capitalexpenditure programme. The general deduction for shortfall is intended tocover the net under-spending which occurs over the programme as a whole,but which it is not possible to allocate in advance to any individual, pro-gramme.8. The rate of growth of public expenditure in demand terms, givenin paragraph 58 of Part 1, takes account both of the contingency reserve and of the deduction for shortfall.

Table 2.17 summarises expenditure in Scotland by central Govern-ment, local authorities and public corporations on services within theSecretary of State&apos;s field of responsibility. These figures are contained with-in the total shown in Tables 2.3 to 2.11 and 2.13. The objectives and main determinants of the expenditure are - explained in the commentarieson those tables. The figures are at 1974 Survey prices, and do not include provision for the relative price effect.2. Between 1974-75 and 1978-79 expenditure within the Secretary ofState&apos;s field is expected to increase by an average of 2.5 per cent a year.In part, this rate of growth reflects the priority given to expenditure related to North Sea oil.3. The changes in the Scottish figures as compared with Cmnd 5519reflect a number of estimating changes. In the Table, industry andemployment programme, increased provision is made for compensationfor price restraint. In the case of Nationalised industries&apos; capital expendi-ture, reductions in later years, due to a rephasing of expenditure to 1974-75,are offset by increased costs. Increases in the Roads and transport pro-gramme result from the inclusion in the table of expenditure by the GreaterGlasgow Passenger Transport Executive in support of British Rail; thisreplaces expenditure attributed in previous White Papers to the Depart-ment of the Environment. The table also includes for the first time thecost of revenue support by local authorities for their own transport under-takings. In the Housing programme, the main increase is for the effectof higher interest rates on Government subsidies and local authority rate contributions to housing accounts.4. The policy changes include reductions in capital programmes and current expenditure for 1974-75 announced by the former administration on17 December 1973; the effects of Government decisions on priorities; and

In addition, theAgriculure, fisheries and forestry programme takes account of variations in subsidies while the Housing programme reflects increased provision for public sector housing improvements and the cost of the standstill in public sector rents.5. Table 2.18 gives forecasts of all current and capital expenditureof Scottish local authorities, including expenditure within the fields ofresponsibility of departments other than the Scottish Office. The figures oflocal authorities&apos; current expenditure in both Tables 2.17 and 2.18 for1975-76 are consistent with the figures for individual services which theSecretary of State has accepted for that year&apos;s rate support grant. about half the capital spending in the Secretary of State&apos;s field of responsibility iscarried out by local authorities. Local authority expenditure is expectedto grow between 1974-75 and 1978-79 by an average of 2.1 per cent ayear, made up of an average increase of 3d per cent on current account,and an average increase of 0.6 per cent on capital account.

These figures are contained within the totals shown in Tables 2.4, 2.6 to 2.8, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.13. Table 2.20 showsforecasts of all current and capital expenditure for Welsh local authorities on services in Wales within the Secretary of State&apos;s field of responsibilities.Figures in the two Tables are at 1974 Survey prices and do not include provision for the relative price effect.2. The forecasts provide for an average annual increase of about1.9 per cent between 1974-75 and 1978-79 in expenditure within the Secre-tary of State&apos;s responsibility. The trends of expenditure in Wales are notdissimilar from those for Great Britain as a whole and the objectives and main determinants of the expenditure are explained in earlier chapters ofthis White Paper.3. The policy changes referred to include reductions in capital pro-grammes and current expenditure for 1974-75 announced by the lastGovernment on 17 December 1973; the effects of Government decisions on priorities; and the short-term additions announced by the Chancellorof the Exchequer on 11 September 1974 to assist the construction industry.4. A number of current developments are likely to affect these figuresduring the period, for example the impending transfer to the Secretary ofState for Wales of powers under section 7 of the Industry Act 1972relating to selective assistance to industry, the intention to set up a WelshDevelopment Agency and a Wales Land Authority, measures to help areasaffected by the reorganisation of the steel industry, and the possibility ofoff-shore oil developments.

Thedifference of  789 million arises mainly because the local authority current expenditure programmes as expressed in Part 2 of this White Paper exclude loan charges and capitalexpenditure met from revenue; there are also differences in the treatment of housing subsidies.The relationship of relevant expenditure to the figures of current expenditure given above willchange as interest rates and prices vary,(2) Capital expenditure on key sector services is subject to specific Departmental approval.Local authorities are however free to set their own priorities within the locally determinedsector as a whole and for this reason the pattern of spending described in the table can be no more than a guide.(3) The figures for 1975-76 onwards reflect the change in classification of expenditure between the key and locally-determined sectors, resulting from the introduction of the newTransport Supplementary Grant System.

Differences are accounted for by:Policy changes which result from Government announced changes in existing policies.(Handbook on Methodology, paragraphs 105-7).Other changes these include estimating changes which result from aRe-costing of the policies embodied in Cmnd 5519. On the status of cmnd 5519, see the Introduction to P^art 2 of this White Paper.Charges payments for goods and services, produced by non-tradingactivities of central and local government which are netted off public expenditure. The payments treated as charges in this sense are more related to the cost of provision of goods and services, not payments whose purpose is to raise revenue. Examples are charges for school meals and for dentaltreatment. (Tables 3.10 to 3.12 above and Handbook on Methodology,Appendix A.)Concessional aid aid in the form of grants or loans carrying rates ofinterest below market rates.Contingency reserve see Table 2.16 and supporting text in Part 2.Debt interest the estimates represent the total payable to private and over-seas sectors by central government, local authorities and public corporations.Demand on output the extent to which a particular category of expenditureimposes demand on currently produced goods and services. Transfer pay-ments when spent by the recipient, produce an indirect demand effect, whichis usually smaller than that of direct expenditure on goods and services(Handbook on Methodology, paragraphs 80-87).Directly related receipts receipts by central or local government, such as national insurance contributions, which are determined in relation to theadministration of particular services but which do not satisfy the conditions for Charges.
Gross domestic product the total value of the output of goods and servicesproduced within the country (see also Productive potential).Prices (adjustments, constant, outturn, relative price effect, Survey) see section II below.Productive potential the capacity of the nation at a particular period oftime to produce goods and services. Productive potential varies with changesin the size of the working population, in the average number of hours worked and in productivity. The actual level of output Gross domestic product-varies with changes in the degree of use of productive capacity.Public corporations nationalised industries, New Town corporations andother enterprises publicly owned and managed in the public interest, as described in Chapter VII of &quot;National Accounts Statistics: Sources and methods&quot;. (Direct government trading activities are not included.)Public expenditure the current and capital expenditure of central govern-ment and local authorities, other than expenditure charged to the operatingaccount of trading bodies, together with the capital expenditure of nationalised industries and other public corporations, and including debt interest and net lending. The estimates of public expenditure in this white paper are net of Charges and do not include imputed rent.Re-costing revised estimate at constant prices of the expenditure requiredto implement a given policy; not to be confused with Revaluation (Hand-book of Methodology, paragraphs 106-7).Revaluation the process of adjusting estimates of expenditure to adifferent price basis in particular, adjusting estimates in the December1973 White Paper (Cmnd 5519) to take account of pay and price changesin the twelve months since those estimates were prepared; not to be confusedwith Recosting (Handbook on Methodology, paragraphs 102-3). See SectionII for the price basis of expenditure affected by foreign exchange rates.Shortfall, general deduction for see Table 2.16 and supporting text inPart 2.Supply expenditure expenditure by central government which is financed by monies voted by Parliament. Details are given in Supply Estimates andAppropriation Accounts.Transfer payments payments for which no goods or services are received in return. They include social security benefits, grants to individuals and companies, and debt interest.II  Price basis(1)1. Unless otherwise stated, the figures of public expenditure in this white Paper are expressed at constant prices. There are, however, twoconstant price series which serve different purposes, each having its ownsignificance and importance.(l) A more detailed account is given in Chapter IV of the Handbook on Methodology.
In volume terms at 1974 Survey prices (Table 3.1)2. The figures embodied in this White Paper described as being atSurvey prices are produced on the assumption that prices throughout theperiod covered have been, and will remain, at the levels prevailing at the base date for the annual (1974) Survey. Such figures measure changes inthe amount of goods and services purchased by the public sector, and thusprovide an indication of the volume of services supplied (hence they aresometimes also referred to as figures in volume terms). They are ofimportance both because prospective changes in the scale of individual services are a natural matter of interest and because it is in terms of thesefigures that the programmes are in practice controlled. Programmeshave to be planned in terms of the underlying activities (eg numbers ofstaff employed; goods and services purchased) needed to give effect toGovernment policies. These therefore are the figures displayed throughoutthe individual programme tables in Part 2 and discussed in the accompany-ing commentaries and summarised in Table 3.1.In cost terms including the relative price effect (Table 3.2)3. In considering public expenditure decisions it is necessary to take account not only of the volume of services of various types it is desiredto provide, but also their prospective cost. The relative costs of differentgoods and services are indicated at any time by their current prices. Pro-objections in volume terms are at prices of the base date, and do not reflectrelative costs in other years. But in practice these price relationships change;some goods, and the cost of some public expenditure programmes, risefaster in price than others. It is not practicable to forecast actual prices, butthe prices of some classes of goods and services have a fairly well definedtendency to rise faster than, and the prices of others to lag behind, theaverage price of GDP; and it is therefore possible to establish trends inrelative prices. By projecting these trends estimates can be made, in broadterms, of this relative price effect in coming years. Fluctuations in relativeprices about their trends have in the past been small, and until this year it has not been necessary to take account of them in estimating relative price effect. In the last two years however there have been some markedchanges in price relationships; in particular there has been a very sharpincrease in building costs. The method of estimation has therefore been revised to take account of deviations of relative prices from, and theirsubsequent reversion towards, long term trend levels.4. Volume projections adjusted by the relative price effect are saidto be in cost terms, including the relative price effect. These figures enable a comparison to be made of the relative costs of different programmes inthe coming years. They can also be used to estimate the relation which theywill bear, individually and in total, to national output at the price levelsappropriate to those years. The constant price basis used for figures in costterms is estimated 1974-75 outturn prices ie the level of prices paid in1974-75 rather than Survey prices which do not all refer to the same date. Table 3.2 is in cost terms throughout. Table 3.1 is compiled in volumeterms, at Survey prices, but the overall adjustment from Survey prices to1974-75 outturn prices, and the adjustment for the relative price effect, are shown separately at the foot of the table, leading to overall totals in costterms.
Market and factor cost prices5. The basic Survey price figures are market prices, inclusive ofindirect taxes and net of any subsidies. In estimating the demand effect orresource cost of expenditure the indirect tax element is irrelevant; asdemand it quickly returns to the Exchequer, and it does not make any callon the basic factors of production, labour, capital and imports. Subsidiescorrespondingly cause market prices to under-estimate demand andresource cost. For this reason factor cost prices, net of indirect taxes andwith subsidies added back, are used in the resources Table 1.1, and in the calculation of the demand effect. In the case of the transfer and lendingelement of public expenditure further adjustments are necessary to take account of the proportion which does not enter into final expenditure on goods and services, because it is paid in direct taxation or saved.Price adjustments6. In this White Paper, for the first time, all cash programmes are treated in the same way as other programmes, and no special price adjust-ments are required. The difference between Survey prices and cost termsestimates in each year is analysed in Table 3.1 between the adjustment to1974-75 outturn prices and the estimated relative price effect.Foreign exchange rates7. Estimates of expenditure which are directly affected by foreign exchange rates reflect average rates prevailing in October 1974. Actualpayments will of course reflect the rates prevailing when those payments are made. However, the contributions to the European Communities are,under the budget regulations, based on a rate of 2.4 units of account tothe  . IIII Classification changes1. The following transfers between programmes reflect changes whichhave occurred since the 1973 public expenditure White Paper (Cmnd5519) in organisation and reassessment of the functions of some elements of expenditure:a. Certain capital grants expenditure (Nature Conservancy Council) from Trade, industry and employment to Other environmental services.b. Expenditure on wages and salaries for the rent registration service from Other environmental services to Housing.c. Some small redistribution of Welsh Office expenditure betweenseveral programmes.d. School health service from Education and libraries, science andarts to Health and personal social services.e. Remission of patients charges-from Social security to health and personal social services.f. Services for the disabled from Health and personal social services to Social security.g. Agricultural support payments in Northern Ireland from Agri-culture, fisheries and forestry to Northern Ireland.2.  Four items are included for the first time in the Survey coverage:a. Financing of certain UK Atomic Energy Authority superannua-tion included in Trade, industry and employment.
b. Grants to the Open University included in Northern Ireland.c. Rates contributions for certain education, health and other servicestransferred from local authorities to central government includedin Northern Ireland.d.

The amounts which have con-sequently been excluded from this White Paper are:  million at 1974 Survey prices1973-74       1974-75       1975-76       1976-77        1977-7885-5 88-1 92-5 96-4 101-44. All expenditure by local authorities oh roads and public transport is now included in the Roads and transport programme in the sectionheaded Local transport. This has entailed a number of changes betweenprogrammes and within the Roads and transport Table (2.6) since Cmnd5519. The major changes are:a. Expenditure on transportation studies and on municipal busoperating deficits from Other environmental services.b. Expenditure by Passenger Transport Executives to support theBritish Railways Board from Support to nationalised transport in-dustries to Local transport: Passenger transport subsidies.c. Capital investment by local authorities and Passenger TransportExecutives on rail infrastructure is shown both in nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditure: Surface transport industries and in local transport: Public transport investment.IV Notes on Table 1.1-The use of resources 1973-19791. Table 1.1 shows possible increases between 1973 and 1979 in the totalresources available to the nation and illustrates the way these increases maybe divided between alternative uses. This note describes and defines thevarious items in the table. All the figures are in volume terms.2. The first column of the table shows the use of the nation&apos;s re-sources in the year 1973. The figures are all in demand terms at 1970 factorcost prices. For indirect public expenditure the figures are estimates of thedemand effects at factor cost flowing from transfers etc made in 1973,although these demand effects may not be reflected exactly in that year.3. Section A shows the supply of resources available for domestic use.Line 1  hows three possible rates of growth in GDP. These reflect differentassumptions about the rate of growth of productive potential but includethe effect of taking up any undue slack by the end of the period.
4. Line 2 shows the balance of trade in goods and services and pro-vides an estimate of the additional resources required to achieve a satis-factory balance of payments on current account. The additional resources are measured by the excess of the increase in exports of goods and servicesover the increase in imports, each valued at constant 1970 prices.5. GDP less the balance of trade surplus (or, as in 1973, plus the deficit) constitutes the resources available for use at home, shown in line 3.6. Section B is a summary of the competing claims on these resources.Line 1 shows private fixed investment (other than in housing) and stock-building.7. Lines 2 and 3 a. to e. show nationalised industry investment andother public expenditure. The changes from 1973 to 1979 are consistent withthe estimates shown elsewhere in this White Paper. Differences in ratesof increase are due to differences in the periods over which the changes are measured and to differences between the conventions and definitionsused in the planning and control of public expenditure and those used inthe National Accounts; the latter are employed in this table.8. Line 2 shows fixed investment plus stock building by the nationalised industries.9. Lines 3a. to c. show direct public expenditure on goods and services. Line 3a., public consumption, includes all current expenditure on goods and services and lme 3b., public investment, includes both fixed in-vestment and stock-building by public authorities and public corporationsOther than nationalised industries, included in line 2.10. Line 3d. shows indirect public expenditure. This attempts toestimate the effect on private expenditure of various forms of paymentssuch as national insurance benefits and other current grants, subsidies anddebt interest. The resource implications of overseas transfers, however, havebeen retained in the balance of trade figures and those of capital grants inthe investment figures of the sectors which receive them.11. Line 4c. shows personal consumption, which consists in this table of consumers&apos; expenditure plus private investment in dwellings. This itemcan then be split approximately into two components: publicly financedpersonal consumption (line 4b.) which is the same as indirect public expenditure (line 3d.), and privately financed consumption (line 4a.) whichis a measure of personal consumption of goods and services purchased atfactor cost out of wages and salaries, income from self-employment and profits.12. All the figures in the table are in demand terms. The methodsused for the calculation of demand effects are explained in chapter V of&quot;Public Expenditure White Papers: Handbook on Methodology&quot;. The con-ventiorial national accounting presentation on which the table is based is fully explained in &quot;National Accounts Statistics: Sources and Methods&quot;(HMSO 1968), especially Chapters I to III.Printed in England by Williams Lea, and published by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office.Dd 255643 K00 1/75
