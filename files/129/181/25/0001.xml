!DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(75) 25 COPY NO        Qoo (C7 March 1975CABINETREFERENDUM:  OUTSTANDING ISSUESMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council1.        There a?e severalieeu*38 r&amp;i&amp;edinthe W&amp;ita Paper on the reiftsendum(Cmnd 5925) on which we must now take final decisions so that work canproceed with the drafting of the Referendum Bill in time for it to beconsidered by Legislation Committee on 25 March.2.        I understand that the Home Secretary is considering separately theextension of the register to British subjects living overseas and postalvotes for holidaymakers.    The other issues are considered in turn in theAnnexes to this paper.    I will give the Cabinet orally on 13 March myassessment of the views expressed in the debate on 11 March.    Meanwhilemy conclusions, which I invite the Cabinet to endorse, are:-i. The wording on the ballot paper proposed in paragraph 10of the White Paper should be incorporated in the Bill (Annex 1),ii,       The Bill should provide for the appointment of independentscrutineers cf the count (Annex 2).iii. The Bill should provide for the appointment by the HomeSecretary of a National Returning Officer to supervise the arrange-ments for a national count and to certify the result (Annex 3).    Butwe should consider announcing on Second Reading that there will bea free vote on the Government side on this issue in Committee.iv. The Bill should provide for grants of equal size, not exceeding 125, 000 in each case, to be made to Britain in Europe and theNational Referendum Campaign, on condition that they make areturn after the poll of income and expenditure from the date ofpublication of the Bill to the date of the referendum (Annex 4).!       v.       The Bill should provide for the Referendum Order to bemade under the Affirmative Resolution procedure (Annex 5).ESPrivy Council Office7 March 1975
THE QUESTIONThe Cabinet agreed on 20 February that the White Paper shouldpropose for discussion the second version in C(75)19 of the wordingon the ballot paper.    They also askeddthe Lord   President toindicate at his press conference and in the debate in the Houseof Commons that this version represented the broad consensus ofview that had emerged from his consultations and to go on tomention the main variants that had been suggested (CC(75)9th Conclusions, Minute 3).2.     Wide publicity has been given to the proposed form of wordsreproduced in paragraph 10 of the White Paper.    Some commentatorsthink that the Question itself is fair,   others that it is loaded,especially because of &quot;stay&quot; rather than &quot;be&quot;, in one direction.There has been little discussion yet of the proposed preamble.3.     Several leading pollsters take the view that the precisewording is unlikely to have a significant effect on the outcome.In responding to an opinion poll, people may reply differentlyto the same question phrased in a different way.    But there is agreat difference between how people respond to a string ofunexpected questions from a pollster stopping them in the street orknocking on their door and how they respond to a question the textof which they have known and been able to think about for severalweeks after hearing both points of view.4.     The reference to European Community in the Question hasimplications for Clause 1 of the Bill, which will state what theBritish people are being consulted about.    Strictly this shouldbe our membership of the three Communities, but this would exposea discrepancy between the Bill and the Question.     It thereforeseems better for the purposes of the Billlto regard the referendumas being about membership of the Economic Community^ the decisionon this automatically carrying with it a decision on the other two.Clause 1 therefore will refer only to the European EconomicCommunity, which permits the singular to be used in the Question.1
/INDEPENDENT SCRUTINEERSThe Cabinet agreed on 20 February that the White Paper shouldinclude a passage indicating that, in the absence of the ordinarypolling and counting agents, alternative arrangements might bemade for the attendance of independent observers at equivalentstages in the poll.    (CC(75) 9th Conclusions, Minute 3).2.     Paragraph 17 of the White Paper said?&quot;The absence of any candidates or their election or pollingagents will leave the referendum without an important elementof the ordinary electoral machinery unless some other provisionis made.   Candidates and their agents are specifically affordedaccess to the various stages in the procedure at which ballotpapers are handled - the despatch and opening of postal votes,the casting of votes in polling stations and the count.    TheGovernment are considering to what extent the presence ofindependent observers would be appropriate and useful at theequivalent stages in the referendum poll.&quot;3.     The functions of these observers differ.    Polling agentsare appointed to detect personation; counting agents are appointedsimply to attend at the count and, by implication, to satisfythemselves that the rules are properly observed.     In theLord Presidents consultations with the political parties a gooddeal of importance was attached to the provision of countingagents; less to polling agents.   The latter are however likely tobe more important in the special circumstances of Northern Ireland,where 2,000 were appointed for the Border P611.4.     In the absence of candidates, the natural alternatives to makethese appointments in the context of a referendum would be thetwo umbrella organisations.   But there may be difficulty in definingthese, particularly where local branches are concerned, in such away as to enable presiding officers to knew who they should admitto polling stations.   Some form of authentication seems desirable.It is desirable that the Bill should -simply make provision forobservers to be approved by the Secretary of State, leaving openfor the time being the administrative arrangements by which nameswould be submitted for approval and the sources from which theyshould be invited.2
3THE COUNTThe Cabinet agreed on 6 February that the votes should be countedand the result announced centrally (CC(75) 7th Conclusion,Minute 3).2.     The White Paper said categorically (paragraphs 21-23):&quot;The Government have taken full account of the views of thosewho believe that the voting pattern of the different parts ofthe United Kingdom should be made known.    But they believethat the most appropriate arrangement in the specialcircumstances of the referendum will be to count all the votescase centrally and to make a single declaration of the UnitedKingdom result.    To announce the result in this way will secureits widest acceptance by the British people.    Detailedarrangements for a central count are now being planned.  ...  .A national returning officer will be appointed in due course.He will be responsible for the arrangements for counting thevotes and certifying the result of the referendum.  .  .  .&quot;3.     Reaction to this decision has been mixed.    The ScottishNational Party and Plaid Cymru, together with some Labour andLiberal Members, have expressed strong opposition on grounds ofprinciple and feasibility. \4.     As to principle, what is said in paragraph 21 of the WhitePaper has attracted a good deal of support, particularly thestatement: &quot;The constituency is the whole of the United Kingdom&quot;.As to feasibility, the report attached to C(75)15 shows that theoperation is difficult but practicable.    Good progress is beingmade with the planning.   Whatever the administrative problems of acentral count, it has the advantage of making it possible to handleas a single operation the checking of the result and, if necessary,the conduct of a partial or total recount.    If there were 50 ormore separate counts (ie by counties) the problems would be muchgreater.5.     If a centralised count is abandoned,    alternative arrangementswould have to be made.   For Scotland and Northern Ireland thereseems no practical alternative to the areas by which polling itselfis to be organised, namely regional and island authorities inScotland and Northern Ireland as a whole.    In England and Wales,however, the alternatives would be either districts and Londonboroughs or counties.    The former would be administratively simple,but would produce some constituency results.    The latter wouldexclude individual constituency results,   but would require noveladministrative arrangements to be made.   These would need to beset on foot as soon as possible, particularly in London   where some5 million electors are involved.
GRANTS TO CAMPAIGNING ORGANISATIONSThe Cabinet agreed on 20 February that a strong case could be madeout for giving a small Exchequer subvention to the two sides inthe campaign, provided that the organisations to receive the moneycould be satisfactorily identified.     They also agreed that thequestion should be raised on this basis in the White Paper and thatthe Treasury should be consulted about the amount of money to beallocated.    In addition the White Paper should propose that themajor organisations should disclose the money they have bothreceived and spent for the purposes of the campaign (CC(75)9th Conclusions, Minute.3).2.     Paragraphs 40 and 36 of the White Paper said:&quot;The Government are prepared to consider providing limitedfinancial assistance, to be equally divided between the twosides, if it is possible to identify two organisations whichadequately   represent those campaigning for and againstcontinued membership of the Community.  .  .  . The Governmentbelieve ...  . that it is a matter of legitimate publicinterest to know how much money- has been spent on thecampaign by major organisations and interests and the sourcesof their income.    .  .  .   The Government are thereforeconsidering ho- far it is possible to require that this. information should be disclosed.&quot;3.     There is no doubt that Britain in Europe and.the NationalReferendum Campaign represent between them   those campaigning forand against continued membership of the Community, and that they aretherefore the two bodies to which grants should be given - just asthey are the two bodies that should contribute to the documentreferred to in paragraph 30 of the White Paper.4.     A decision,on the level of Government assistance to the twoorganisations&apos; needs to take account of several factors:i. 1      The- White Paper&apos; refers1 to giving only &quot;limitedfinancial   assistance&quot;-; there is the clear implicationthat the larger part Of the costs of. their campaignsshould   be borne by the organisations themselves. Onthe other hand, if they decide to give this assistance,Ministers will no doubt want it to be large enough torebut a charge from either organisation that it was notable to run a reasonable campaign.ii. Through bearing the cost of the document referred toin paragraph 30 of the White Paper,    the Governmentwill effectively be subsidising both organisationsat considerable cost to the taxpayer - about 750,000.4
5iii.     The Central Office of Information have advised that itwould cost  70,000 for a one-run half pageadvertisement in all the main daily and Sunday papers,together with the major provincial papers - or,  ,  135,000 for a full page,5&apos;.    On this basis a total subvention of  250,000 between the twoorganisations (ie  125,000 for each) seems a reasonable limit.   Itwould be appropriate for the Lord President of the Council toaccept responsibility to Parliament for the payments which,subject to further consideration of the technical questionsinvolved, should be carried on the Vote of the Privy CouncilOffice.   This would require a supplementary estimate but grants,could be made from the Civil Contingencies Fund once the Bill hadhad its Second Reading.6.     It is desirable that the Bill should specify an upper limit tothe grants and the two organisations to which they are to be made.It should also set out the purposes for which the money may bespent, and include the most Important of the jconditions to beattached to the grants, namely that after the referendum-the twoorganisations should make a return of all their income andexpenditure from the date of publication of the Bill to the dateof the referendum.7.     It would not be practicable to impose more extensive   ,requirements.   The two umbrella organisations Will be workingthrough and in association with a large number of local and branchorganisations whose links with the parent organisation will oftenbe tenuous. . These local groups are already raising and spendingmoney in ways for which It   will be difficult and often impossibleto secure.authenticated accounts.   It would be even more difficultto impose a similar obligation on companies at large.   Theexpenditure would have to be defined In very broad terms as beingdevoted towards producing a particular result in the referendum,and this might well cover items for which no separate account isordinarily made.   Such a requirement would be meaningless withoutsome sort of sanction; but even if this could be provided, theproblem of enforcement would be insuperable and the-result mightwell be to penalise the innocent and overlook the guilty.   Even ifthe straightforward problem of enforcement did not exist it wouldstill be possible to. escape such a requirement without muchdifficulty by various nominee arrangements.
THE ORDERParagraphs 42 and 43 of the White Paper said:&quot;It /the Bill/ will also include the power to adapt theexisting /electoral/ machinery by Order.  . .  . The Orderwill be made as soon as possible after the Bill hasreceived Royal Assent.    A draft will be published at thetime the Bill is introduced or very soon afterwards.   Thiswill enable the Bill to be debated against the backgroundof specific proposals relating to the machinery.   The contentsof the Order will be technical and seem likely to beuncontroversial.   The Government will, however, take accountof any views on matters of detail expressed during the debateson the Bill.&quot;2.     Although the Order is not likely to be controversial, it willspecify the date of the referendum and attract a lot of interest inthe House and outside; and there will be pressure for a debate on iteven if it is subject to the negative resolution procedure.REgulations made under the Representation of the People Acts aresubject to the affirmative resolution procedure.    The Order will beadopting and modifying not only provisions in such regulations, butalso provisions in the Acts themselves.    The Northern IrelandBorder Poll Order was made under the affirmative resolution procedureand there will be overwhelming pressure for the same procedure tobe adopted on this occasion.   There are no arguments which could beadvanced in support of the negative resolution procedure.3.     If, as the Lord President has already indicated is likely tobe the case, the Bill provides for the affirmative procedure, itshould be possible to lay the Order in draft on 21 or 22 May(immediately after Royal Assent) and to debate it in both Houseson 2 June (immediately after the Recess).     It would be made andcome into force on the following day, ie just in time for thereferendum to be held towards the end of the month.7 March 19756
