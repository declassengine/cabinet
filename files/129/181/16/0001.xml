ANNEXEEC REFERENDUJ,!:    INFORMATION POLICYReport by a Ministerial Group -Following the discussion in Cabinet on 23 January (CC(75) 5th Conclusions,Minute 6), we were set up as a Ministerial Group under the chairmanship ofthe Lord Chancellor &quot;to consider the practicability, form and control of any government information programme relating to the e.c. referendum havingregard to the extent of non-Government publicity&quot;.Necessity and Practicability of Information programme .     Notwithstanding some scepticism about the impact of earlier publicitycampaigns about the European Community, we consider that a government information programme will be essential as the means of discharging a necessary part of the Governmenfs responsibilities in relation to the referendum.   We have not, however, been able to agree about how all aspectsof tbe programme should be prepared and presented;   nor can we be sure atthis stage that all aspects will prove practicable - in advance of final decisions on the scope and character of the Governmenfs programme, and ofthe opportunity to consider draft texts of information material.3.     We have examined a possible information programme in three principal,and largely distinct, areas -a. Basic factual information about the referendum itself, the composition of the European Community, and United Kingdom membership;b. Presentation of both sides of the case for continuing membership of the European Community;c. Presentation of the Governmenfs own recommendation on the membership issue.4.     In considering these areas, we have taken into account non-government publicity.   This will oover the Press and the field of television and radioas well as the planned programmes of the pro- and anti-Community campaigninggroups, and it is not practicable, at least at present, to assess its full extent.   Vfe do not believe, however, that we can look to this publicity to1
/present all the information which the public will require.   Moreover, thegeneral approach to the European Community of the greater part of the mediawill make it difficult for the public to secure a balanced understanding ofthe membership issue unless the Government make their own contribution tothe information field.5.     We consider in turn the areas in paragraph 3 above.Basic Factual Information6.     There is a nucleus of essential information which the Government shouldmake available to the public.   It should be designed to explain the natureof the referendum, and the reasons for holding it;   the bare facts about theEuropean Community (its members etc), and a brief account of how the UnitedKingdom became a member and the commitment to renegotiation.    Some of this information has been well puhlicised in the past;   but much of the previousmaterial has been overtaken by events, and survey data confirms a genuinefeeling among the public that this information is needed.7.     V/e recognise that even this basio material will not be easy to draftobjectively, but we think that the effort should be made.   We envisage thatdistribution would take the form of a single pamphlet, to be deliveredthrough the post in, say, April to all households.   It would&apos;be necessary tonegotiate the arrangements for this delivery with the Post Office and thePost Office unions.   We recommend against delivery to each elector, since this would be much more costly and would involve the substantial extraexpense and effort of addressing envelopes.8.     The estimated cost of producing and distributing these pamphlets, aswe propose, to all households would be of the order of  850.,000 for a simpleblack and white format and  1^ million for a better quality pamphlet.Both Sides of the Case9.     V/e consider that the Government should be, and be seen to be, responsiblefor seeing that both sides of the case are presented to the electorate asfairly as possible.   This might be done by way of another postal distribution to households - about, say, the end of May - of a second pamphlet which wouldprovide the material on v/hich the electorate would be able to make up theirown minds.   Its contents might be -a. A short introduction in the name of the Government, explainingagain the nature of the referendum and the object of the pamphlet.2     &apos;
&quot;b.   A passage about the renegotiated terras.c.   Two separate pieces, of about one to two thousand words each, onthe cases for and against continued membership.10.   We recognise the difficulties of drafting the two separate pieces atc. above,   We do not favour the possibility of inviting the pro- and anti-European Community movements to contribute pieces on their own case.   ThisI iVbUwould be able to give those &quot;umbrella&quot; campaigning groups an unjustifiedstatus.   V/e also doubt whether the Government should attempt, on theirown, to produce an objective account of both sides of the case.11.   This is a matter which requires further study;   but v/e are inclined to the view that the necessary material will need to be prepared by theGovernment an consultation with the appropriate political authorities andcampaigning groups.   It might be supplemented, in the same pamphlet, bya series of identical questions with separate answers provided by eachcampaigning group,,12.   This second pamphlet might consist of about 16 pages in all in an attractive format.   The estimated cost of printing and distribution would,oragain, be of the order of  850,000 of  1^ million depending on quality.The Government1s Recommendation13.   The Government&apos;s own decision on their recommendation to the country on the issue of continued membership will be bound to attract substantialpublicity.   A White Paper will presumably be issued; there will beParliamentary debates;   Ministers will appear on television and radio;and so on.14.   We have been unable to agree on how much further, and in what way,the Government should go in presenting their recommendation - from which a minority of Ministers may decide to differ, and then to put their differentview publicly.15.   Some members of the Group argued that it would be contrary to the fair conduct of the referendum, and thus wrong in principle, for theGovernment to use the resources of the Government information services (andthus taxpayers&apos; money) to present their view on an issue which they haddeoided should be left entirely to the decision of the electorate.   ThereJ
was an analogy in the period of a General Election in which the government information Services were inactive.   The second pamphlet (paragraph above) could make clear the nature of the Governmenfs recommendation inthe introduction or in the context of presenting the case which had theGovernment&apos;s support.16.   Other members of the Group took the view that a General Electionperiod was not a true analogy.   On the European Community issue theGovernment would take a decision, as a Government, on the recommendation to be put to the British people.   It would be entirely proper, and theGovernment&apos;s duty, to explain and justify their recommendation throughmeans which went beyond the publication of a Government White Paper.   one possibility might be for the second pamphlet to include a section setting-out the Governmenfs recommendation and the reasons for it.   In addition,the Government might be free to use the information machine in the normal way to ensure that their own recommendation was fully understood.17.   This is a difficult issue - requiring a political balance to be struckbetween, on the one hand, the Governmenfs role in ensuring the fairconduct of the referendum campaign with, on the other hand, the Government&apos;responsibility for conveying their own recommendation to the country.   Theview of the Cabinet will be needed as a basis for further work.Machinery and Control18.   An inter-departmental information unit should be set up in the cabinet office to carry forward work on a Government information programme.   Itshould include members of the Government Information Services with experience of the presentation and technical aspects.   It should be directly responsible to the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, but might carry out its task under the supervision of the Ministerial Group (if this should bekept in being).19*   The unit, once established, can serve as a general information centre(to handle enquiries relating to the referendum from the Press and thepublic).   Its immediate task should be to prepare drafts of the two pamphletswe have proposed.   A draft of the first pamphlet should be submitted as soonas possible for collective Ministerial consideration.   The preparation of adraft of the second pamphlet will need to take account of the view theCabinet reaches on the considerations set out in rwragraphs 15 and 16 above.
Conclusions20,   We invite the Cabinet to agree that -a. In the light of the referendum commitment, and of non-government publicity so far as it can be assessed at present, there needs to be aGovernment information programme broadly composed of -(i) basic factual material about the referendum itself, the composition of the European Community, and United kingdom membership (paragraphs 6 and 7);(ii) the presentation, in some form, of the case both for and against European Community membership (paragraphs 9-11);(iii) the Governmenfs own recommendation on the issue of membership (paragraphs 15-17).b. An interdepartmental unit should be established in the cabinet office as soon as possible with the task of planning and preparing theinformation programme required;   it should be directly responsible tothe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, but should work under the supervision of the Ministerial Group, if this Group is kept in being(paragraph 18);c. The interdepartmental unit should, as its first task, prepare aGovernment pamphlet on the basis of a.(i) above to be distributed, as arranged with the Post Office, to every household in, say, April next,d. The unit should also undertake the preparation of a secondGovernment pamphlet, for similar distribution at about the end of nextMay, to cover a.(ii) and (iii) above - taking account of the Cabinet&apos;conclusion on the basis of paragraph 21 below.21,   We invite the Cabinet to consider - as a basis for the task of the interdepartmental unit at d. above - what guidance they wish to give on thequestion of presenting both sides of the cases (paragraphs 10 and 11) andon the issue of the extent and handling of the Government&apos;s informationeffort in support of their own recommendation to the country (paragraph 17).7 February 19755
