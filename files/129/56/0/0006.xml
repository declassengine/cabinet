Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.     gC. (52)35622nd October, 1952CABINETGovernment Information ServicesTRANSFER OF CERTAIN INFORMATION WORK TO THE central office OF INFORMATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet (C.C (52) 34th Conclusions, Minute 3) invited me (1) to arrange for a more detailed examination to be made of the extent towhich information work now carried out by separate staffs in theDepartments could be centralised in the Central Office of Information,and to discuss such transfers of work with the departmental ministers concerned;(2) to submit a report showing the numbers of staff engaged, and the expen-diture incurred, on information work, both in the Central Office ofInformation and in the Departments.2. I append a statement showing staff numbers on 1st April, 1952, and estimated expenditure on Government information services in 1952-53. On1st April, 1952, the total number of staff employed in the Central Office of Informa-tion was 974 (of whom 522 were engaged in home information work and 452 in work for the overseas Departments), and its total estimated expenditure for theyear was  1,653,000 (home  1,119,000, overseas  534,000). The total number ofstaff employed in the Departments (excluding the B.B.C. and the British Council)was 2,173 (home 743, overseas 1,430) and their total estimated expenditure was 3,142,950 (home  1,319,800, overseas  1,823,150). All of these staff figures havealready been reduced since 1st April, 1952, and are likely to be still further reducedby 1st April, 1953. The Central Office has nearly completed its reduction and on1st September, 1952, its staff was 864, a drop of over 500 since September 1951.&quot; Contracting out &quot; from CO.I. common services . Except for some German work, the overseas Departments already make full use of the technical services provided by the Central Office in the work of their overseas information services, the objects of which are, of course, very different from those of the information activities undertaken by the home Departments, andthe bulk of their information staff are employed abroad. It is mainly in respect ofhome information work that there is scope for further centralisation under theCentral Office of Information.4. In a few cases Departments still carry out technical production work (suchas the design of posters and exhibition displays) in publicity media in respect ofwhich the Central Office acts for the great majority of Departments. This &quot; con-tracting out&quot; is on a much smaller scale than it was three or four years ago-43094B
partly because some Departments which formerly contracted out now use theCentral Office and partly because of the reduction in information activities this year.Contracting out still exists, however, in the case of the National Savings Committeeand the Scottish Savings Committee, to some extent in the case of the Ministryof Agriculture, Post Office and Ministry of Works, and to a small extent in thecase of the Admiralty, Air Ministry, Ministry of Food and Department of scientific and Industrial Research. The number of staff engaged in these Departments in the types of work in question is 37, and the amount of money involved (salaries plusoperational expenditure) is roughly  340,000 this year. The National SavingsCommittee and its Scottish counterpart are responsible for the majority of thisstaff and by far the greater amount of the operational expenditure ( 259,000 outof  315,000).5. On the principle that full use should be made of an existing commonservice organisation, there is a case for transferring the activities referred to inparagraph 4 to the Central Office of Information. Economy is most likely to besecured by centralising demands (often fluctuating demands) in one place, so thatstaff and resources are more fully employed throughout the year and expertiseand overhead costs spread over a larger volume of work. It is true (as thePostmaster-General pointed out in his memorandum C. (52) 86) that there is a danger of carrying centralisation to a point where the centralised organisation isbeyond the optimum size for efficiency; but, after the successive reductions ininformation expenditure that have taken place, the Central Office of information is nowhere near that point at present. The Central Office estimated that it could take over all the work referred to in paragraph 4 with an addition of only 17members to its staff-an immediate saving of 20.6. I do not, however, suggest any immediate transfer of all this work tothe Central Office. Thus, I have come to the conclusion that it would be wrong to disturb existing arrangements so far as the National and Scottish SavingsCommittees are concerned: and that covers the greater amount of the operationalexpenditure under consideration. I suggest, therefore, that we leave matters onthe present basis, under which the Treasury and the Departments keep under review the need to extend the use of the central agency in appropriate cases, as opportunityaffords.Remaining Departmental Information Activities8. It will be seen, however, that the 37 staff so far considered are only about per cent, of the total number of staff who were at 1st April, 1952, engaged in home information work outside the Central Office of Information. The Treasuryestimates that there has already been a reduction of about 7 per cent, on the1st April figures (and in some cases, notably the Air Ministry and the Ministryof Food, the reduction is much greater), but this still leaves about 680.9. Some of this number are employed in activities which the Central Officeof Information has never undertaken and, broadly speaking, is not equipped toundertake, e.g., with answering Press enquiries and maintaining general contacts with the Press and the B.B.C. The Cabinet Committee on Government information services (C. (52) 82) recognised that this work must remain with Departments.Again there is a miscellany of publicity duties which the Central Office could notconveniently undertake. For example, the Exhibitions Branch of the Board ofTrade organises trade exhibitions and fairs, the National Savings Committeeorganises rallies of voluntary workers, and the Service Departments hold open daysat Service Establishments. It is also necessary for the Departments to maintainliaison between their policy-making staff and the Central Office of Information.10. It would, however, be useful to have a special scrutiny of all departmentalinformation staffs. These have been reduced over the last few years by a smallerpercentage than either the Central Office of Information staff or home informationexpenditure as a whole. I propose accordingly that the Treasury, as part of itsnormal function of controlling Civil Service complements, should, in conjunctionwith the Departments concerned, undertake in the coming months a comprehensivestaff inspection of all departmental information divisions with a view to eliminatingany unnecessary posts.
Summary11.   I accordingly invite the Cabinet , :  (1) to agree to the continued existence of the Central Office of Information,.     subject to continued scrutiny by the Treasury of the numbers of staff employed in . the light of the diminishing amount of informationexpenditure;(2) to note that the field for any further centralisation is relatively small butto agree that the general aim should continue to be the abolition of contracting out as suitable opportunity affords;(3) to note that the Treasury will make an inspection of departmentalinformation staffs.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,22nd October, 1952.43094.
