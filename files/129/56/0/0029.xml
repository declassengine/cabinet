SECRET Copy No. 7 3C (52) 37931st October, 1952CABINETDEVELOPMENT IN THE STERLING area memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. Development and the Balance of PaymentsMy colleagues will have seen the Report on Development Policy produced by the Preparatory Meeting of Officials (C (52) 373). Its main feature is undoubtedly the stress which it lays upon the &quot; primary requirement &quot; that develop-ment in the Sterling Area should be directed towards the improvement in theArea&apos;s balance of payments and the need for strict restraint in development whichdoes not contribute to this end. The Report further stresses that such develop-ment must be economic and that there is no place for uncompetitive import savingproduction which can flourish only behind a barrier of import restriction.2. It is true that these conclusions are qualified by the acceptance of thefact that a certain amount of other forms of investment is necessary, e.g., in theinterests of national security and social advancement, but even this qualificationis made subject to the warning that in present circumstances &quot;the need to, keepsuch investment to a minimum is more pressing than ever.&quot; It would be verywrong to assume that the United Kingdom economy could carry the whole of this additional burden unless we are prepared to impose upon ourselves a substantial measure of self-denial during the next few years.3. In the light of this report we must decide whether, at the Prime Ministers&apos;Conference, Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are prepared to commit themselves  ....-,.     (a) to intensify development within the United Kingdom designed to improve the balance of payments;(b) to urge the acceptance of a similar policy upon other sterling Common-. wealth Governments;(c) in the event of their agreeing to do so, to offer some additional contribution from United Kingdom resources to suitable schemes.4. It is necessary to consider the implications which the acceptance of theReport would have for the United Kingdom economy. Increased investment inthis sector of the economy will only be possible if we are prepared to devoteadditional resources to it and to make the necessary adjustments in order to., dpso. If we attempt to increase our investment without having the real resources available for that purpose, we will merely increase pro tamo the strain on thebalance of payments. We must aim to secure some of these resources from anincrease in national productivity,: but we must be sure that this increase is real and will not be eaten away by increased consumption before we base any plans on it; and to the extent that we have to devote more of our existing resources tothis purpose we must be prepared to accept the consequences in the form of lessgoods for consumption or a slowing down of investment on defence and on highly desirable social capital.5.   Despite this prospect, however, it is to: my mind very satisfactory that thePreparatory Meeting of Officials should have endorsed so clearly the need to con-concentrate investment on the improvement of: the Sterlirig Area&apos;s balance Of payments:I have no doubt that this conclusion is right and that its acceptance by Her Majesty&apos;s43148 B$--Printed ,for the Cabinet.

government in the United Kingdom is in the national interest. Whether or notsterling is convertible, the prosperity of the Sterling Area and the maintenance ofits standards of living will continue to depend on its balance of payments with therest of the world; and about this there is no room for complacency.6. In the four years 1948-1951 the Sterling Area&apos;s average deficit with thenon-sterling world was of the order of  160 million per annum. This period included1950, a year of great prosperity. It was a period in which all sterling countries were restricting imports from the dollar area and in which dollar aid was flowinginto the area at a rate of over  250 million per annum. It is true that the sterling area is expected to be in balance with the rest of the world in the year 1952-53 butthe balance is a precarious one and there is reason to be anxious about the future.There is little scope for further cuts in imports from non-sterling sources. We cannot longer rely on receiving dollar aid. We shall need to buy an ever-increasingquantity of raw materials for our expanding industries and the number of mouthsto be fed in the Sterling Area is increasing at the rate of 10 million a year.7. It is, moreover, greatly to our interest that the other sterling countries should accept and make a real effort to implement the recommendations of thePreparatory Meeting. The extent to which they are willing or able to do so will vary from country to country, but their attitude will undoubtedly be greatly influenced by that of the United Kingdom and we must give them a lead.8. I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will agree that at the forthcoming conference, Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should announce their readiness to accept the need to intensify development designed to improve the balance of payments recommended and should do everything possible to persuade Other Commonwealth Governments to follow suit.II. Fields for Further Development;i\y-: 9. Section V of the Report identifies a number of major fields in whichintensive investment within, say, the next five years, could make a substantial contribution towards improving the Sterling Area&apos;s balance of payments.; 10. The fields chosen include food grains and meat and dairy products, all ofwhich are of importance to British agriculture. The agricultural expansion pro-gramme is constantly under review and I do not think that any special measures are called for. As far as United Kingdom industry is concerned, the two mostimportant fields are steel and engineering products, the latter including, in par-ticular, locomotives and rolling-stock, heavy electrical equipment, tractors and agricultural machinery. As regards steel the Report recognises that its shortagehas been one of the main limiting factors which has held up economic activity ofalf sorts in recent years. It is satisfactory to know that we have to some extentforestalled the Preparatory Meeting on this subject as a survey of the UnitedKingdom steel position making recommendations regarding capacity in 1956-57has recently been completed and will, I hope, be submitted to Ministers in the nearfuture. ,11. The United Kingdom engineering industry presents a more difficult problem. The departments concerned are constantly engaged in breaking bottle-necks which are impeding essential production. But the industry consists of amultiplicity of private and highly specialised firms and the main contribution whichthe Government can make to its expansion is the creation of an economic climatewhich encourages the firms which compose it to develop production along the rightlines. One difficulty has been their natural reluctance to expand without some assurance that there will be reasonably stable arid continuing market for their products. This reluctance may to some extent be mitigated by the recognition ofthe Preparatory Meeting that the products of the industry are &quot;fundamental tothe development plans of the whole sterling area,&quot; and its endorsement of the needfor expansion. But the problem of creating the right sort of climate is a complexone upon which I would welcome the views of the Minister of Supply. I suggestthat we might then instruct officials to examine ways and means of stimulating theexpansion of those sectors of the industry whose capacity to contribute towardsdevelopment and the balance of payments is greatest.
III. The Flow of United States and Other Capital into the Sterling Area12. The need to encourage foreign and particularly United States investment in the development of the resources of the Sterling Area is generally recognised,but so also are the difficulties in the way of attracting the United States privateinvestor to invest outside North America. The Report rightly points out that the sterling Area cannot rely on this source for any large or early flow of funds and while it recommends that whatever possible should be done to encourage the flow,it is difficult to see what precisely can be done to implement this recommendation.Unfortunately all sterling Commonwealth Governments find very real difficultiesin offering to the American private investor the sort of conditions which he would find attractive (e.g., the maximum freedom from controls of all sorts; the ability to import from the United States such capital equipment as he needs irrespective ofthe restrictions on such imports by nationals of the countries concerned; very high rates of interest and the lowest possible taxation).13. A Working Party composed of representatives of all CommonwealthEmbassies in Washington is at present examining this question and I hope that its recommendations will be available before the November meeting. In the mean-time, as far as the United Kingdom and the Colonial Empire are concerned, Ithink that the only constructive step that can be taken is to allow investors to repatriate across the exchange capital gains in respect of approved investmentsmade since January, 1950. This facility already applies to the sterling equivalent of the original capital invested and there is good reason to believe that its extension to&apos; capital gains would be regarded by United States investors as an earnest ofour general readiness to welcome their contribution to Sterling Area development.The concession is not likely to cost us very much and is, I think, well worth making.14. The Report of the Committee does not call for any decision from her majesty&apos;s Government as regards the encouragement of United States investmenteither directly by the Government or through such agencies as the Export-ImportBank and the Internal Bank for Reconstruction and Development. This is aquestion which will have to be considered further in relation to any approach thatwe make to the United States administration on the general economic front,following the November meeting.United Kingdom Investment in the Commonwealth15. The United Kingdom representatives on the Development Committeewere authorised to state that &quot; in the event of other Commonwealth Governmentsaccepting the need to make an intensive drive to permit development directed tothe improvement of the balance of payments, the United Kingdom might consider making a special effort to contribute towards schemes of a suitable character.&quot; in doing so they stressed that they had no authority to commit Ministers at this stage and that practical possibilities would have to be considered before any decisions;were come to.16. This announcement on the part of the United Kingdom raised the greatestinterest among the other Commonwealth delegations and we must now decide whether to undertake such a commitment. The following considerations aterelevant:  (i) It can be argued against doing so that the United Kingdom&apos;s economic position is so uncertain and our balance of payments so precarious thatwe cannot afford to undertake any additional burdens. In support of.this argument it can be said that additional investment overseas is.more difficult than similar investment at home because it calls for acorresponding increase in our favourable balance on current account;and is less profitable from a payments point of view because the,products of the new capital assets go to improve the balance of payments. of the overseas country concerned whereas the United Kingdom onlybenefits to the extent of the profit or interest on its investment.(ii) On the other hand (a) if we were not to. go ahead with our offer we would seriously weaken the chance that other.sterling area countries would concentrate on balance of payments development.43148 b 2
(b) The offer of fresh United Kingdom capital would give us a valuablemeasure of control over the development plans of the beneficiary!    ! countries.   A United Kingdom contribution to a particularproject could, for instance, be made conditional on our being satisfied that the country&apos;s general investment programme was on the right lines, that the project itself contributed towards theimprovement of the Sterling Area&apos;s balance of payments, and that sufficient financial contribution being forthcoming from the other side to ensure that it was carried out efficiently and economically,and that our contribution could be made in the form of capital goods.(c) We could hope in appropriate cases to secure the long-term assur-ance of raw materials to United Kingdom industry as was doneby the recent loans to the Aluminium Company of Canada, andthus contribute to the solution of one of the country&apos;s major economic problems.(d) The implementation of the offer would not necessarily involve ahigher rate of capital outflow from the United Kingdom thanin the last few years. It is impossible to quantify how muchmight be involved and indeed in our present economic uncer-tainty it would be dangerous to attempt to do so. But the out-flow of private United Kingdom capital to the Sterling Area,which is, of course, uncontrolled, has been tapering off with theincrease of interest rates and the tighter monetary policy at homeand we may hope that if the other Sterling Area Governments&apos;;. maintain effective control of their internal economies, this tendency will continue. Private capital must, of course, continueto form the major United Kingdom contribution towards the, r development of the resources of the Commonwealth but it must-. u be our aim to persuade other Commonwealth Governments tocreate conditions which will discourage United Kingdom invest-ment of the sort which makes no contribution to the balance ofpayments.(e) Finally, the impact of such a policy if adopted upon the UnitedKingdom economy is not likely to be substantial in the first year or so, as it will be a considerable time before any number ofschemes can be approved for assistance; and as the burdenincreases we may hope that our capacity to bear it will increasealso.17. In the light of these considerations, I believe that the case for a gestureof this sort is a good one and would recommend that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould, at the forthcoming meeting, announce its readiness to consider schemeswith a view to ensuring that an agreed part of the finance is made available inapproved cases. I would not propose that we should say anything about theamounts which the United Kingdom were prepared to put up under these pro-posals beyond stressing that in the present state of our balance of payments theycould not be large enough to affect the view of the Development Committee that&quot; much the greater part of the finance for the development of the resources of the sterling Area countries must be raised domestically by the countries themselves.&quot;18. If this suggestion commends itself to my colleagues I will examineurgently the question of the machinery through which the new funds in question might be made available and submit a further paper on this before the ConferenceOpens.Summary19.   I recommend -        ,(i) That Her Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake so far as the UnitedKingdom is concerned to intensify development directed towardsimproving the Sterling. Area&apos;s balance of payments and should pressother sterling Commonwealth.Governments to adopt the same policy intheir own countries (paragraphs 1-8).
(ii) That Her Majesty&apos;s Government should put in hand an examination of thepossibility of stimulating expansion in those sectors of the engineering industry which can make the largest contribution towards development(paragraph 11).(iii) That Her Majesty&apos;s Government should express their readiness that theUnited Kingdom economy should make a special contribution to approved development projects in other sterling commonwealth countries which, in the opinion of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, arelikely to contribute towards the improvement of the Sterling Area&apos;balance of payments (paragraphs 15-18).R.
