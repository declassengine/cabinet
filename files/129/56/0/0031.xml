THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HER BRITANNIC   majestys   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1952SECRETC. (52) 3817th November, 1952CABINETPERSIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsFollowing the Cabinefs discussion on 23rd October (C.C. (52) 89th Conclu-sions, Minute 4), further conversations took place on 24th October between departments concerned and Mr. Nitze, Head of the State Department PolicyPlanning Staff.  My colleagues may like to know what passed.2. Mr. Nitze was told that we thought it most unwise for the United StatesGovernment and Her Majesty&apos;s Government to give the Persians any indication that there was an alternative to the joint Anglo-United States proposals of30th August. To do so would weaken our position not only in Persia but inother Middle Eastern countries, and would encourage other countries to adoptPersia&apos;s blackmailing technique. We also pointed out that the American ideasfor a solution, the essence of which was that compensation for the Anglo-iranian oil Company (A.I.O.C.) should be fixed in direct negotiation with the PersianGovernment and not through impartial adjudication, were bad in principle,dangerous in their repercussions on other concessionary countries and impracticable.We could not therefore agree to any such ideas being canvassed with the Persians,and we were strongly opposed to any particular figure for compensation beingmentioned.3. It was recognised that the Persians would find it very hard to accept thejoint proposals, particularly as they related to arbitration. We tried to showMr. Nitze how this difficulty might be overcome. We outlined, for his informationonly and not for communication to the Persians at this stage, arguments tending to allay Persian fear of arbitration. We also suggested that the most likely way of persuading the Persians to accept arbitration would be to tell them that there wereprospects of immediate benefits on a substantial scale once they had acceptedarbitration. In this connexion various arrangements were discussed by which other Customers besides the A.I.O.C. might, at the outset and as soon as arbitrationhad been agreed, take considerable quantities of Persian oil. Mr. Nitze had pre-viously said that the United States Government might be prepared to give Persiaat the outset a considerable sum of money as advance payment for crude oil and products to be supplied to their armed forces under the Defence Materials Produc-tion Act. Mr. Nitze was told that this seemed a hopeful development, and he accepted the suggestion that, if he cared to come to London again, we might workout plans with him on this basis.4. Although Mr. Nitze was initially disappointed at the unfavourable recep-tion of his ideas, he left in a happier frame of mind and seemed genuinely to agreenot only that we ought to stand by the joint proposals, but that there was somehope of progress on that basis.5. Since Mr. Nitze&apos;s departure the Departments concerned have been engaged,with officials of the United States Embassy and representatives of the A.I.O.C.,on a detailed study of the practical side of the joint proposals on the lines outlined in paragraph 3 above.A.
