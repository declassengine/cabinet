(THIS- DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET-1- 3 1A   ifC.(52) 389 COPY NO. U_ \4TH NOVEMBER, 1952CABINETMARKETING OF EGGSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee recently considered(E.A.(52) 27th Meeting) a memorandum supporting the recommendationsof the official Working Party that the allocation and price control of eggsshould be ended in March, that the subsidy should be ended, and that thepresent system of fixed buying prices should be replaced by one of guaranteed support prices (E.A.(52) 125).2.        The Committee felt that there was no alternative to the freeingof the market in eggs, since the present system of allocation and price control is not working satisfactorily, and accepted the recommendations in principle, subject to submission to the Cabinet.     Some members also expressed the view that an easement in imports of eggs from overseasmight be desirable.3.        The effect of the proposals must be to cause a rise in the priceof eggs and in the cost of imports, though there would be a saving of some 20 millions per annum on the subsidy.    I have considered with theMinister of Food whether there would be advantage in making some increasein the retail price of eggs before decontrol, so that the effect of the risewhich would ultimately be necessary would be tapered off;  but our conclusion is that there is little to be gained by putting retail prices up before the publiccan be given the compensating advantages of a free market.    It would not, inany case, be desirable to increase prices before Christmas, and the saving of subsidy from an increase during January and February would be quite small.4.        It was suggested during the Committee&apos;s discussion that there wouldbe advantage in combining the freeing of eggs with comprehensive plans for expansion of production and freedom of prices over a wider field.    A schemefor freeing feeding stuffs and cereals from control will shortly be submittedby a Working Party of officials, and it may ultimately be possible to linkthis important development with the removal of control over eggs;   butpublic speculation about egg marketing is now so widespread that it is undesirable to defer an announcement on that subject, and I recommend thatthe Minister of Food should be authorised to make a statement on the linesof the draft attached,R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.4TH NOVEMBER, 1952.
DRAFT STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER OF FOOD.The Government has had under review the present arrangements for the distribution of eggs with particular attention to themaintenance of the principles of Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1947.The system of allocation is not well suited to currentconditions, and has come under severe criticism on the ground that eggsare escaping from control in quantities which make it impossible tosecure equitable distribution of the whole supply.   This unsatisfactory state of affairs can only be brought to an end and the consumer given access to all the eggs available by creating a market in eggs.   The Governmenthas therefore decided that the allocation and price control of eggs shall cease next Spring.   The subsidy would also be eliminated, but this is theperiod at which supplies are likely to be most plentiful and the immediate effect on the price to the consumer is likely to be least.   Some increase in price is inevitable if consumers are to be given better access to supplies.The working out of appropriate long term arrangements forthe orderly marketing of eggs must take some time, and it is necessary toproceed by stages.   At the first stage, which may well last some twelvemonths, the Ministry of Food will continue to be the sole importer of eggs,and will also be responsible for carrying out the Governments obligationto home-producers under the Agriculture Act.   My Agricultural colleagues and I shall enter immediately upondis cuss ions with the representatives of the producers and other interests with a view to maintaining orderly marketing of eggs in this interim period and to the establishment as soon as possible of a settled arrangement (including scope for a Producer s1 MarketingBoard) for the implementation of Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1947.
