(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL ,---------                                                                                      /   -1C, (52) 400 COPY NOv17th NOVEMBER, 1952.CABINETuNEGOTIATIONS WITH ARGENTINANote by theChancellor of the exchequer circulate for consideration by my colleagues a report by the overseas Negotiations Committee seeking decisions on the conduct of thepresent trade negotiations with Argentina,R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.17th NOVEMBER, 1952.On 18th September the Cabinet considered a report on the progressof the negotiations (C, (52) 300), and agreed (C.C.(52) 80th Conclusions, Minute 1)that some measure of credit should be offered to Argentina as part of a generally satisfactory agreement providing for our requirements of meat.2. Last year the Argentines were given a credit of  20 millions and they want the same this year, but Ministers have decided that they shouldbe offered only  10 millions in the first instance.   Comprehensive proposalsfor an Agreement have been exchanged but little progress has been made,3, The latest proposals put forward by the Argentines are most unsatisfactory.   They have made little advance to meet our point of view.They have demanded facilities for the repurchase of the dollars which theyhave had to sell in order to buy the sterling they need.   We have been willingto meet them on this point provided that it does not involve the use of the credit.4. The Cabinet have already agreed that, whatever happens in theArgentine negotiations, the weekly meat ration must fall to Is. 9d, from 30thNovember.   This must be announced on 19th or 20th November.   The cabinet were informed on 18th September that the absence of an early agreementwith Argentina would entail a substantial further reduction in the ration,and that it might be necessary within a short time to go down even as low asIs. 4d.   But in the light of the latest reports, particularly about supplies from australia, the prospects are much better.   Even without Argentine supplies,if the meat ration were to be reduced by only a further Id. to Is. 8d. , it ishoped to maintain that level until the end of March provided always that there
are no unforeseen difficulties.   This could be achieved by running down our stocks to the lowest practicable level and by deferring the proposal todecontrol meat products.   If by the end of March Argentine meat had started to arrive or was immediately in prospect, we could probably keep up theIs, 8d, ration thereafter.   Otherwise, it would be necessary to reduce the rationsprobably to Is, 6d, and to keep it there tmtil home killings increase againnext summer.5. The present state of the negotiations is as follows:&quot;(a) MeatThe quantities and types of carcase meat and offals which the argentines are offering are (apart from the question of pork) acceptableand consist of 228,000 tons over a twelve months period.   There isstill a difference on price;   the latest Argentine demand is for a&quot;pilot&quot; price of  171 a ton for Frozen &quot;A&quot; beef, against our latest bid     1of  155.   The Ambassador already has auhority to go up to  160 and afurther increase need not be precluded.   (Last yearfs price was  126;our opening bid this year was about  140  and that of the Argentines was 192),   We do not want to take their mutton, but the Argentines are notpressing us to do so at this stage.   They want us to take some pork, and,although it is expensive, we would not in the last resort refuse to do so,The Ambassador has offered to take some pork, but so far only inreturn for a concession on United Kingdom less essentials.The Argentines are also insisting on our taking about  5-^ millionsworth of canned corned meat.   The Ministry of Food state that theycannot afford to make this purchase out of their limited non-sterlingimport quota.   There is a possibility that if a review of stockpilingpolicy led to a decision to spend more money on stockpiling we mightwant to buy some canned corned meat.The Argentines are also asking us to license certain meatproducts, some of which we regard as non-essential, and which weshould license only if they agreed to grant import licences for our less-essentials.(b) CreditThe Argentine insistence on a full    20 millions credit is largelyfor political reasons, as this was the amount agreed in 1951.   but although last year&apos;s credit was not in the event used, the Argentines will certainly wish to make substantial use of the facility this year.   Wehave offered  10 millions credit, provided that it is not used for t erepurchase of dollars (a careful formula was devised for this). They suggestthat interest on credit and interest earned by their Central Bankbalances with the Bank of England should be the same;  they would agree to no interest or would accept a rate of about 2.\c/o,   (At presentthe balances earn about Z\c&apos;/0).   They first insisted that the whole creditshould be available for any use they like, including the purchase of dollars previously sold to us for sterling, but they appear to be prepared to limit this demand to the first  10 millions of the  20 millions forwhich they have asked,(c) United Kingdom exports of less-essential commodities to ArgentinaIn the last negotiations we secured only a vague statement of intention about the percentage of Argentine expenditure on United Kingdom
less-essentials, including such goods as textiles, motor cars, pottery,glassware and other consumer goods,,   We have asked in the present negotiations that the Argentines should assure us import licences for at least  5 millions of United Kingdom less essentials.   We havealso said that, if the Argentines do not license our less-essentials,we will cease to issue import licences for meat specialities and otherArgentine less-essentials, i, e. goods which we have always taken inspite of the unsatisfactory treatment accorded to our less-essentials.The Argentines have in reply offered to purchase United Kingdom less-essentials with 10 per cent of their earnings from exports in excess of 90 millions.   Even if  90 millions were reached, 10% of the excesscould only be small.   They have made it clear that they can onlyconsider these imports on condition that they have satisfaction on theircredit demands, and that they are able to buy all the essential commoditiesthey need.(d)   Financial Payments to the United KingdomArrears of financial payments due to be met under the 1951 Protocolstill amount to about  1.4 millions, although this includes somedoubtful cases.   The Argentines are still examining &quot;various solutionsof outstanding cases&quot;.   In addition, arrears of royalties (at least 300,000 and still rising), commercial arrears on current account( 400,000 at present and likely to rise to over  1 million by mid-1953),and current financial service payments (amounting to the greater partof  3 millions) have to be met.   The Argentines have stated that it willbe absolutely impossible to allow transfer of any financial services or royalties in 1953,   They have made no attempt to pay the arrears onthe Province of Buenos Aires Loan, 1910.   As regards the settlement ofthe claims running into several million pounds for the expropriation ofPrimitiva Gas Company and Anglo-Argentine Tramways, the argentines have now suggested that the Agreement should provide for a mixed committee to consider this problem.(e)  United Kingdom exports of essential commodities.The Argentines have asked for 800,000 tons of coal,  2. 5 million tonsof fuel oil,   2 million tons of crude oil and 27,000 tons of tinplate.   Wehave offered them 750,000 tons of coal,    2 million tons of fuel oil,the full 2 million tons of crude oil and 15,000 tons of tinplate.   Therewill probably be little difficulty about increasing our offers of coal andtinplate, but the additional amount of fuel oil is not available,6.       The Ambassador estimates (Buenos Aires telegram No. 326 which isattached as Annex) that, in order to conclude an early agreement, we must beprepared to:-(a) Accept the Argentine request of  20 millions credit and a low rate ofinterest.(b) Allow some use of the credit for repurchase of dollars.(c) Pay a &apos;pilot&apos; price of  165 a ton for Frozen &quot;A&quot; beef.(d) Take about  5^- millions worth of canned corned meat and about 2-1 millions worth of pork - the more generous we are on these twoproducts the more hope there is of getting licences for our less-essentialexports.
SIS(f) Accept the position that we shall obtain no satisfaction on financialremittances and arrears and no improvement on the latest offer onless-essentials (paragraph 5(c) above).-The Ambassador adds that he sees &quot;little prospect of obtainingsignificantly better terms by prolonging negotiations beyond a certain point&quot;.7. Broadly there are three courses open to Ministers:-Course (a) to try for a rapid settlement meeting all the points mentionedin paragraph 6 (see paragraph 8)jCourse (b) to make no substantial concessions.   This would involve our being prepared to face an early break in the negotiations with we might be able to avoid by a change in approach(see paragraph 9);Course (c) to continue negotiating, aiming at the best possible settlement,making such concessions as Ministers feel able to accept (see paragraphs 10 and 11).8.     Course (a)    There is obviously much to be said for an early and satisfactory settlement both from the domestic and international political points of view.But it will be seen that the concessions which the Ambassador considers wemust make in order to achieve a quick agreement make a formidable list.   Thegreatest difficulty is the Argentine insistence on the use of the credit for therepurchase of dollars.   This appears unacceptable.   It would be very difficultto justify lending sterling which would be immediately used to reduce our goldreserve.   The objections to some of the remaining concessions needed for aquick settlement are less serious, but if they are conceded in order to secure anagreement it must be recognised that the agreement as a whole will be bound to attract severe criticism.   We consider that it should be our aim, in spite of the ambassador&apos;s advice, to try to reach agreement on a less unsatisfactory basis,particularly as a quick settlement is not now crucial for the maintenance of areasonable meat ration.9.    Course (b)    We cannot exclude the possibility of a breakdown in thenegotiations if Ministers do not feel able to make substantial concessions towardsthe Argentine point of view.   This could lead to a deterioration in politicalrelationships and might lead to a breakdown in economic relations with a virtualsuspension of trade and drive the Argentines to other markets, for example tothe United States for coal and to Persia for oil.   There is a chance - no more thana chance - which we cannot evaluate without further enquiry, that we could avoidthese developments if we said that       we were unable to accept the latestArgentine proposals and thought it best to revert to the idea that we should makespot purchases of meat.   We could continue to send them the quantities of their essential imports which we had already offered and would expect them to agreeto grant export licences for such quantities of meat as we might buy from timeto time at market prices.   This proposal would need detailed examination.   Atfirst sight it seems that, from our point of view, it has the advantage of avoidinggiving credit and to involve less embarrassment from the point of view of SouthernDominion meat prices next year.   On the other hand, we should get mo remittances;probably no satisfaction on less essentials;   we should probably have to pay more for the meat;  and we should have no certainty about quantities.
10.   Course (c)     We should continue negotiations, making if necessary suchconcessions as we can afford, in the hope that a settlement on more reasonableterms can be obtained.   Ministers will note that, in the Ambassador&apos;s opinion,there is little prospect of obtaining significantly better terms by prolongingnegotiations.   This will involve a reduction of the meat ration to Is, 8d,and its announcement forthwith, together with an indication that it can bemaintained at that level through the winter even without supplies from Argentina,11. If this course is adopted, the Ambassador will need to know whatconcessions Ministers are prepared to make on the following points:(a) CreditIt is unlikely that the Argentines will retreat from their demand for anincrease in the credit to  20 millions.   To accept thisis doubly difficult in view of our policy of restricting credit andof the real risk that the Argentines will, because of their balanceof payments position, be unable to pay back the credit they willhave used.   All the indications are that it will not be possible to conclude a settlement without giving the  20 millions.   There isalso the question of the use of the credit for the repurchase of dollars (see paragraph 8).(b) Interest on CreditWe have so far stood out for a minimum commercial rate ofinterest.   We are inclined to think that the Argentine demand for a lower rate will have to be conceded in the last resort.(c) Remittances and other financial matters the Ambassador&apos;s instructions on these matters should still beto do the best he can, especially if a credit of  20 millions isconceded;  but we do not question his judgment that we cannot expect to receive satisfaction,(d) Canned corned meat and less essentialsThe issue here is whether, in order to secure an agreement, weare prepared to spend up to S.5j millions on a commodity which wedo not really want and which the Ministry of Food say they cannotaccommodate within their import quota.   We cannot count onArgentina buying our less essentials in exchange for a purchaseof their canned corned meat.   But a purchase of canned corned meatmight facilitate an exchange of our less essentials for theirs,(e) Utilitie sThe Argentines have not lived up to their undertakings in the lastAgreement to facilitate a settlement of these claims.   Our aimin the present negotiations has been to get the ArgentinaGovernment to negotiate direct with the Companies for a settlement.Until now they have maintained that they could not do so as both cases were sub judice.   The Foreign Office believe (and the ambassador agrees) that the present offer (see paragraph 5(d) above)represents the best we are likely to get and that the ambassador should be authorised to accept it.
o12, There are a number of points on which we do not think any decisions are required from Ministers, although there is still room for negotiation ondetails,   The Ministry of Food consider that if the other outstanding matterscan be settled, reasonable meat prices can be agreed.   So far as supplies toArgentina are concerned, we can meet them on coal, tinplate and crude oilbut there is no possibility of supplying the 2, 5 million tons of fuel oil whichthey have demanded.13. Ministers decided that the credit should be provided throughVotes of Parliament;   they did not however decide which Department should beresponsible.   The Treasury consider that the balance of advantage lies with aprovision on the Foreign Office Vote, particularly since, in the case of any otherDepartment, legislation would be required.   The Foreign Office, however, seeserious objections to this course.   We think that Ministers must now be asked todecide this issue.14.       Matters for decisionMinisters are asked to decide:(a) which of the three courses outlined in paragraph/ph 7 above should beadopted;(b) if the decision is course (c), i. e. to continue negotiations, whether our ambassador should be authorised at an appropriate stage in thenegotiations, to make any of the following concessions:(i) offer credit up to  20 millions;(ii) accept the Argentine demand for a low rate of interest on the credit;(iii) agree to the purchase of canned corned meat and if so how much;(iv) accept the Argentine offer on public utilities.Ministers are asked to confirm that there should be no concession onrepurchase of dollars out of the credit and that they are prepared toaccept Argentine failure to satisfy us on remittances and arrears,(c)    which Department should be responsible for the Vote on which the credit is to be borne,15th November, 1952,

The more generous we are on these two the more hope there is of getting United Kingdom less essentials.

Y/e doubt if we should in any circumstance obtain satisfaction on financial remittancesor on financial arrears under Article 10.   There is in anycase little feeling here on these subjects among Britishbusinessmen.   It is unlikely that we could get better termsthan those suggested in paragraph&apos;3 above for public utilities,or any notable improvement in the offer on less essentials, unless we are prepared ourselves to spend much more money.   With time at our disposal we might secure some limitation on the use of credit for recapture of dollars if not also on the use of whole 20 million, hut we cannot estimate how long this would take.7.   Circumstances seem more propitious at the moment forpressing matters, and without involving Lord Reading, there maybe opportunity for further pressure when we see the Minister forForeign Affairs on Monday evening and the President on Tuesdaymorning [grp omitted] any instructions yoa.   may he able to sendme before then would be most helpful.ADVANCE COPIESMr. CoulsonHead of Economic RelationsDepartmentB B B
