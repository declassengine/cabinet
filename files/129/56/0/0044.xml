DEFENCE programme memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty,the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary ofState for air in the Chiefs of Staff revised Global Strategy Review, the estimatedcost for defence in 1953/54 was  1,719 millions.As a result of discussions with the Chancellor, the Minister of Defenceoffered a minimum compromise figure of  1,645 millions, a reduction of 74 millions.The Chancellor now offers a maximum figure of  1,570 millions.There is thus a gap of  75 millions between the Chancellor&apos;s offer and the Minister of Defence&apos;s minimum figure.2. If this gap of  75 millions for one year is accepted, then the effecton the programme over a period of three years would be a reduction in fighting strength of:-Royal NavyA further reduction in the Active Fleet of -1 Aircraft Carrier1 Cruiser5 Destroyers and Frigates3 Submarines1 Minesweeper2 M. T. Bs.The replacement and modernisation programmes would be retarded in all major classes and inparticular completions of new construction withinthe period would be fewer by 7 Frigates,2 Submarines, 25 Minesweepers and24 smaller vessels.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued- for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No........55C.(52) 3946TH NOVEMBER, 1952CABINET

It may well be argued that the loss in fighting power caused by a cut of  75 millions seems disproportionately high when it is compared to total defence expenditure.    We would point out that this reduction in the threeyear programme has to be borne by those parts of our defence estimates which do not include inescapable and recurrent expenditure on maintenance.Broadly speaking, service estimates last year comprised  882 millionsexpenditure on such matters as pay, movements, food, accommodation, etc.and  580 millions set aside for production.    No reduction in the manpowerof the Services could yield any appreciable saving in 1953/54 and so a saving of  75 millions this year can only be achieved by cutting the money for new production and therefore the impact of the cut is disproportionatelyhigh on rearmament itself.4.      It may also be argued that there is still a large field for economyon maintenance expenditure.    A very thorough scrutiny of this fieldwas made at the time of the 1952/53 estimates when a cut of 202 millions was imposed on the three Services.    The object of this examination was to.absorb as much as possible of this cut on maintenance expenditure, so as to retain the maximum amount for new production whichis so essential to all three Services.    A second examination in the samefield was carried out in order to meet this year&apos;s minimum proposal of 1,645 millions put forward by the Minister of Defence which involved areduction of  74 millions.    Because there was no fat left almost all ofthis further reduction had to be met by sacrificing new production, farand away the least acceptable method to the three Services.     All this happened before the Chancellor&apos;s new cut of another  75 millions was proposed.
We are by now convinced that there is little or no scope for further reduction in maintenance.5.    For these reasons we think it our duty to make it plain to the Cabinetthat we cannot reduce this year&apos;s defence expenditure below 1,645 millions and still retain the same fighting strength.J.P.L.T.A.H.D.L.D.6TH NOVEMBER, 1952.
