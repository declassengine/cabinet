Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1952CONFIDENTIALC (52) 3864th November, 1952CABINETCORPORAL PUNISHMENT AS  A PENALTY FOR  CRIMES  OFVIOLENCEMemorandum by the Home secretary at the Cabinet on 23rd October last (C.C. (52) 89th Conclusions, Minute 2)I was asked to circulate a memorandum as a basis for a discussion on the questionof corporal punishment as a penalty for crimes of violence.2. Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, abolished corporal punishmentas a judicial penalty on .13th September, 1948. Previously, the courts could awardcorporal punishment for a limited number of offences, the principal one, so far asadults were concerned, being robbery with violence contrary to section 23 (1) ofthe Larceny Act, 1916. A copy of this section is given in Appendix 1.3. It is now suggested by the Lord Chief Justice and others, not merely thatthe courts should again be empowered to award corporal punishment for robberywith violence, but that they should be given power, which they have not possessedfor nearly a century, to impose corporal punishment for other crimes of violenceagainst the person.4. The question of corporal punishment was reviewed by a DepartmentalCommittee in 1938 (Cmd. 5684 of 1938). This Committee reported (i) that theyhad been unable to find any body of facts or figures which showed that the intro-duction of a power of flogging had produced a decrease in the number of offencesfor which it might be imposed; (ii) that they similarly had found no evidence thatoffences for which flogging might be ordered had tended to increase when littleuse was made of the power to order flogging, or to decrease when the power wasexercised more frequently; and (iii) that, while they naturally did not deny thatcorporal punishment had some deterrent effect, they were not satisfied that ithad that exceptionally effective influence as a deterrent which was usually claimedfor it by those who advocated its use as a penalty for adult offenders; or that thealternative punishment of a long sentence of imprisonment was so ineffective asa deterrent that it was essential, for the protection of society, to retain whateveradditional element of deterrence might be afforded by a sentence of corporal punishment.5. The suggestions that the whole question should now be re-opened havebeen given force by the increase in recent years in crimes of violence against theperson, an increase which has naturally caused a good deal of apprehension in thecountry. Some relevant statistics are given in Appendix 2. It will be seen that in1948, 646 cases of felonious wounding were known to the police in England andWales, whereas the figure for 1951 was 1,078. For malicious wounding the figuresfor 1948 and 1951 were 3,547 and 4,445 respectively; for rape 252 and 335; andfor indecent assault on females 5,659 and 7,287.6. The problem of reducing crime is of the first importance, but it is not a problem which is capable of any simple solution, and in my view there is insufficientinformation available at present to suggest that the introduction of corporal punishment would necessarily have any marked effect.43168 copy No.
Few would urge the introduction of corporal punishment merely for retaliationpurposes; the lex talionis is no longer accepted as a sufficient justification for criminal penalties, and history has shown too often that severity for severity&apos;ssake is a double-edged weapon if it leaves the offender a more embittered enemy of society.Few also would attempt to justify corporal punishment, as a reformativepunishment; there is a very great difference between corporal punishment admin-istered by a parent or schoolmaster and corporal punishment administered to anadult by an impersonal agent of the law long after the commission of the offence.Its introduction could be justified only on the ground of its value as a deterrent,in preventing the individual from repeating his offence, or in preventing othersfrom committing similar offences. It is extremely difficult to prove by statisticsthat corporal punishment has, or has not, been a deterrent in either of these senses.But the 1938 Committee, as explained in paragraph 4, failed to find any evidence to suggest that corporal punishment had proved an effective deterrent in eithersense; and there are available two relevant (although not conclusive) pieces of statistical information. First, as regards deterring offenders from repeating theiroffence, researches made by the 1938 Committee and, more recently, as a result ofa debate in the House of Lords in 1950, show that of the persons convicted ofrobbery with violence from 1921 to 1940, those who were flogged tended on thewhole to have a rather worse subsequent record than those who were not flogged.(The courts were so inconsistent in their awards that those who were ordered tobe flogged were not necessarily the worst offenders.) Secondly, as regards the deterrent effect on others, the numbers of offences of robbery with violence knownto the police in England and Wales, unlike other crimes of violence against theperson, have actually gone down since they could no longer be punished byflogging.   The figures are as follows:  Not too much importance should be attached to these figures, but I suspect that ifthey showed a sharp increase the advocates of corporal punishment would be tempted to attach more significance to them than they do at present.7. Some of the Judges suggest that the degree of violence used in crimes ofrobbery with violence is greater than it used to be. One must clearly pay greatrespect to these opinions, but I have found it difficult to obtain any very definite evidence on the point. I have ascertained that of the 210 robberies in the Metro-politan Police District during the first nine months of 1952 no weapon was usedin 145 cases (or 69 per cent.); in 17 (or 8-1 per cent.) a firearm was used; in 37 (or17-6 per cent.) a cosh or stick was used; and in 11 (or 5 - 2 per cent.) a knuckledusteror sharp instrument was used.8. The Criminal Justice Act, 1948, provided for new methods of dealing withyoung offenders and with persistent offenders. It has unfortunately not beenpossible, largely because of difficulties of capital investment, to do much about theprovision of the new institutions for young offenders contemplated by the Act, butthe first detention centre has now been opened and eight attendance centres arefunctioning. The provisions about persistent offenders have been in full operation for some time, and the courts have made good use of the powers to pass sentences of corrective training and preventive detention; there are now 1,700 men andwomen serving sentences of corrective training and nearly 900 men and womenserving sentences of preventive detention. It is too early, however, to attempt to assess what effect these longer sentences are likely to have, and there is muchforce in the argument that it would be premature to reverse the provisions of theAct about corporal punishment until there has been more time to assess the effectof the whole scheme of the Act for dealing with offenders.194619471948194919501951804842978860812633The provisional figure for the first six monthsof 1952 is 359
9. It has been claimed that, if offenders were flogged and not sent to prison,or sent to prison for only a short time, such a course would afford much relief tothe overcrowded prisons; but, even assuming that a criminal who was flogged andthen set at liberty did not.return to prison for some later offence, such a coursewould not have such a marked effect as has been suggested. The overcrowdingin. prisons affects principally the local prisons where short sentences are servecf.If corporal punishment had been available as a judicial penalty for all crimes of violence to the person, and if all the men sentenced since the beginning of 1947 to more than two years&apos; imprisonment for such offences had been flogged and had notbeen sent to prison, the present prison population (whjch is just over 20,500) wouldbe reduced by less than 1,000. If all the men sentenced since the beginning of 1947to more than two years&apos; imprisonment for the particular offence of robbery withviolence had been flogged and had not been sent to prison, the present prisonpopulation would be reduced by not more than 350.10. In the recent debate in the House of Lords, the Lord Chief Justice urgedthat courts should be empowered to order flogging by the birch, but not by the&quot; cat,&quot; on the grounds that birching was more humiliating. The 1938 Depart-mental Committee were satisfied that birching, as administered in prisons, was almost as painful as a flogging with the &quot; cat.&quot;11. Before 1948, juveniles could be whipped for a wide variety of indictableoffences, but the power was little used. In 1945, 1946 and 1947 (the last three fullyears before section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, came into force) whippingwas ordered in 25,&apos; 15 and 9 instances, respectively. Crimes of violence bychildren and young persons are small in relation to the total, number of indictableoffences by those persons, and any question of reintroducing corporal punishment for young offenders raises considerations quite different from those which apply inthe case of adults.12. Corporal punishment was retained by the Criminal Justice Act, 1948 asa punishment for certain grave offences committed by prisoners in prison. TheDepartmental Committee in 1938 thought that it was justifiable to hold this power in reserve as an ultimate sanction in cases where men were already serving longsentences on the grounds that in these special circumstances no other penalty would operate as a sufficient deterrent, and that otherwise there might be a danger ofprison officers taking the law into their own hands.13. Corporal punishment is a question on which emotions are easily arousedand on which many people, on both sides of the controversy, hold strong viewsbased on sentiment rather than on intellectual conviction. I do not think that itwould be wise to ignore the agitation for the re-introduction of flogging as a judicial penalty, related as it is to a natural anxiety about the prevalence of crimesof violence. At the same time I do not think that it would be justifiable to embark,without further inquiry, on what many people would regard as a reactionaryproposal and to introduce legislation forthwith giving the courts power to orderCorporal punishment, at a time when corporal punishment has been abolished asa judicial penalty in nearly every other civilised country.My own view is that it would be right to set in train a new inquiry, not in orderto postpone the decision, but in order to focus public opinion and. to obtain up-to-date information. I have given some thought to the question whether such an inquiry might be undertaken by a Royal Commission or by another DepartmentalCommittee. The most important point is that the members should commandconfidence.  I should like to have:  (1) a Lord of Appeal who has experience of criminal cases and has not declared&apos; his views;(2) a prison governor;(3) a chief constable; -,     (4)-(6) two or three Members of Parliament representing each Party;(7) an employer;(8) a Trade Unionist, and &apos;  -(9) a woman. . -     , .      - .   (.  .If eminent people from these categories would serve,on a Departmental CommitteeI should prefer that body. If I,could not get persons of weight to serve on a departmental Committee, then 1 should prefer a Royal Commission., I am afraid,however, that the announcement of the setting up of a Royal Commission would be criticised on the ground that it was merely a device to shelve the problem.43168 b 2

The arguments in favour of a Royal Commission may be summarised asfollows. A Royal Commission would be obviously independent of the Minister,and would have greater dignity and powers than a Departmental Committee. the criticism that a Royal Commission would involve delay could to some extent bemet by stating that the Commission had been asked to report in, say, six months.There might be some objection to appointing a Departmental Committee whichwould to some extent be reviewing the recommendations of a similar committeewhich reported in 1938.14. I accordingly suggest, for the consideration of my colleagues, -that a royal Commission or Departmental Committee should be appointed and chargedwith the duty of considering, in the light of the present level of crime, whether thereare grounds for reintroducing corporal punishment as a judicial penalty. In making this recommendation I do not overlook the fact that, if the Royal Commission orDepartmental Committee were to recommend the introduction of a power to awardcorporal punishment, there might well be difficulty, with the present composition of the House of Commons, in securing the passage into law of the necessary legislation.I give in Appendix 3 a summary of the discussions on corporal punishmentwhen the Criminal Justice Bill, 1938, was before Parliament and during the passageof the 1948 Act. It should, I think, be borne in mind that if the Government inthe end introduced legislation restoring corporal punishment, some members ofthe Conservative Party would feel themselves in a position of difficulty, and itmight be felt right to give the views of the Government but to leave the issue toa Free Vote, as was done in the case of amendments to the 1948 Bill relating to capital punishment.DM. F.Home Office,4th November, 1952.APPENDIX section 23 of the Larceny Act, 1916, as originally enacted, provided asfollows:  &quot; (1) Every person who (a) being armed with any offensive weapon or instrument, or beingtogether with one other person or more, robs or assaults with intent to rob, any person;(b) robs any person and, at the time of or immediately before orimmediately after such robbery, uses any personal violence to anyperson;shall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof liable to penal servitude for life, and, in addition, if a male, to be once privately whipped.(2) Every person who robs any person shall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof liable to penal servitude for any term not exceeding fourteenyears.(3) Every person who assaults any person with intent to rob shall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof liable to penal servitude for anyterm not exceeding five years.&quot;It will be observed that only those who were convicted of offences under sub-section (1) could be ordered to undergo corporal punishment.The words in this subsection &quot; and,, in addition, if a male, to be once privatelywhipped&quot; were repealed by the Criminal Justice Act, 1948.

Moreover some indictableassaults may have been recorded by the police as non-indictable offences and the magistrates&apos; court decided subsequently that they should be tried on indictment.
APPENDIX 3Debates in Parliament in 1938-1939 and 1947-1948 on the abolition of corpora!punishment as a judicial penalty1938-1939Clause 32 providing for the abolition of corporal punishment was includedin the Criminal Justice Bill which was presented to Parliament in 1938.
