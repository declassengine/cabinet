Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1952SECRET Copy No. (59C. (52) 3843rd November, 1952CABINETITALO-YUGOSLAV relations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that on 30th September (C.C. (52) 82nd Conclusions-,.Minute 2) I told; then a that, as; a resjaUt of my leeeafc conversation- with SignerDe Gaspera and Marshal Titov I had become- convinced that there was no realprospect of devising a settlement of Trieste acceptable tm both sides; on the basisof exchanges of territory as of populations between the Zones, and that the best course was to seek to persuade the Italian and. Yugoslav Governments to, accepta permanent division of the territory on the basis of the existing Zone boundaries.I was; invited to concert with the United States. Government an approach on theselines to the Italian and Yugoslav Governments.2. In the event, the United States Government were not willing at this stage to participate in an approach to both Governments or to take any action whichmight be interpreted as pressure upon the Italian Government. ConsequentlyI made a communication to the Italian Government only, but kept the yugoslav government informed. On 8th October I conveyed to the Italian Ambassadormy impressions on the present attitude of Yugoslavia,, and in particular on thepossibilities of a solution of the Trieste problem. My impression was that- asettlement leaving Zone A to Italy and Zone B to Yugoslavia was the solution which was the most likely to be immediately practicable. If Signer De Gasperishould be able to- agree to such a solution, it would receive the support of her majesty&apos;s Government. The only two alternatives to this solution, in my view, were either to leave the situation as it was or for the Italian- Government to resumebilateral negotiations with the Yugoslav Government if they thought that theymight thereby obtain a more favourable settlement.3. Although Signer De Gasperi has. not as yet given an official reply, it seems clear from conversations, which he has had with Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at: Romethat the Italian Government find the proposal; unacceptable. With an eye nodoubt on- the elections due to be held in Italy next spring, they consider that any concession on Trieste might dangerously strengthen their opponents, on the. Leftas well as on the Right.4. Meanwhile, in a memorandum dated 10th October, the Italian Govern-ment have drawn the attention of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and of the UnitedStates and French Governments to recent further extensions of Yugoslav legislation to Zone B of the Free Territory of Trieste, which in the view of the Italian Govern-ment constitute violations of the Italian Peace Treaty. The. memorandum went onto say that the Italian Government (i) were seriously concerned at the ultimate aims of Yugoslav policy, which gave them no feeling of security as regards Italy&apos;sfrontiers; (ii) would consequently take all necessary measures so as to be preparedagainst any unforeseen contingency; (iii) drew the attention of their allies to thenecessity for restricting the supply of arms and war material to Yugoslavia untilthe situation had cleared; (iv) would raise the question of alleged Yugoslavviolations of the Italian Peace Treaty in Zone B direct with the Yugoslav Govern-ment, with a view to submitting the matter by common agreement to theInternational Court of Justice; (v) reserved the right to raise the question in theNorth Atlantic Council.43158
5. Having studied this communication, I caused the Italian Embassy to beinformed that 1 had been very unfavourably impressed by those parts of the Italianmemorandum which concerned the alleged Italian fears of Yugoslav policy.6. On 22nd October the Italian Embassy, on instructions from Signor DeGasperi, gave the Foreign Office clarification of the parts of the Italian memo -&quot;;randum to which I had particularly objected. With regard to the point in&quot;paragraph 4 (i) above, Signor De Gasperi alleged that Yugoslav actions and the speeches of Yugoslav statesmen made it abundantly clear that the Yugoslavs stillmaintained claims on practically all territory up to the Isonzo River, includingTrieste. As regards paragraph 4 (ii) above, Signor De Gasperi explained that,bearing in mind Yugoslav territorial claims and in view of the steadily mountinglevel of Yugoslav armaments, the Italian Government had felt it necessary toproceed to studies of a defensive character and to the strengthening of frontierposts on the Italian-Yugoslav frontier. Finally, in amplification of the point inparagraph 4 (iii) above, Signor De Gasperi put forward the suggestion, &quot; forconsideration by our British friends,&quot; that military supplies should for the present be limited to training material and that, in so far as it was felt necessary to haveequipment near the possible scene of action, this should be kept in dumps on theItalian side of the frontier.7. The Italian Embassy were informed that such a clarification could onlyaccentuate the very unfavourable impression caused by the Italian memorandumof 10th October. The suggestions about the supply of equipment to Yugoslaviawere obviously quite unrealistic, and the revelation that the Italian Governmentcould be thinking in terms of strengthening their frontier against a neighbour whowould be Italy&apos;s first line of defence against the real enemy could not fail to makea particularly bad impression upon Her Majesty&apos;s Government. The ItalianEmbassy replied that, given past Yugoslav actions and public pronouncements, Italycould not view with equanimity the present trend, primarily on the part of the americans, to strengthen the Yugoslav Armed Forces, even though the primepurpose was defence against the East. Signor De Gasperi had thought it rightto say so frankly to his Western allies.8. On 27th October, when Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome called onSignor De Gasperi in order to inform him that defence planning talks between an officer designated by Her Majesty&apos;s Government and &quot;the United States andFrench Governments and representatives of the Yugoslav Government would shortly begin in Belgrade, Signor De Gasperi remarked that, without a politicalsolution of the Trieste question, military conversations were very risky. He againemphasised his concern that the arms and munitions which the three Powers were now supplying to Yugoslavia might one day be used for an attack on Italy. when sir V. Mallet scouted this idea, Signor De Gasperi answered that Tito might quitepossibly one day stage a coup on Gorizia such as DAnnunzio had staged on Fiume,and the NAT. Powers might then try to treat it as a mere incident.9. I think that my colleagues should be aware of these developments, whichindicate a serious malaise in Italo-Yugoslav relations and emphasise the consequentdifficulty in reaching an early solution of the problem of Trieste. I have little doubt, however, that the Italian Government are intentionally exaggerating to her majesty&apos;s Government and the United States and French Governments theirsuspicions of Yugoslav policy. The reason for this is that they are probably stillhoping to be able to induce us, the Americans and the French to use our militaryand economic aid to Yugoslavia as a means of pressure upon the Yugoslav Govern-ment with regard to Trieste.A.
