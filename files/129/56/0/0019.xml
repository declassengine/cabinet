Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952SECRET Copy No.C. (52) 36927th October, 1952CABINETEGYPT: DEFENCE negotiations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs since his coup d&apos;Etat on 23rd July, 1952, General Neguib, the Egyptian PrimeMinister, has been consolidating his position by a number of measures, includingfurther purges and the reduction of the Egyptian political parties to impotence,and it seems likely that the present Egyptian Government will succeed in maintaining its position, perhaps on increasingly dictatorial lines.2. General Neguib&apos;s record, and that of his associates, contains a numberof disquieting features and there is a real danger that extremist anti-foreign elements in the new regime may gain the upper hand. Nevertheless, General Neguib himselfhas shown a certain degree of moderation and a greater sense of reality thanprevious Egyptian Prime Ministers. It would probably be wrong to expect thenew Egyptian Government to show any friendliness towards us, but they mayapproach Anglo-Egyptian problems in a more practical way. H.M. Embassyand the United States Embassy in Cairo, in a joint appreciation forwarded to meon 20th September, concluded that General Neguib&apos;s Government merited our support. H.M. Ambassador in a recent despatch to me (No. 213 of 25th September)expressed the view that we have now an opportunity to lay the foundations of a sound understanding with the Egyptian Government, but he does not think thatthe opportunity will last indefinitely.3. I suggest therefore that it may be useful now to consider Whether any fresh instructions should be sent to H.M. Ambassador at Cairo, with special reference to our defence problems, and if so, on what lines these instructions canbe drafted.4. Hitherto the basis of our policy towards Egypt has been the advice whichwe have received that it is essential to maintain in peace-time the Egypt base ifthe Middle East is to be successfully defended in war. The maintenance of the base did not however preclude the withdrawal from Egypt of British combatantland forces, provided that Egypt was prepared to agree to certain conditions. these considerations underlay the instructions which were sent to H.M. Ambassador atCairo last spring; I attach at Annex a recapitulation of these instructions.5. Since last spring, however, we have to take into account certain factors which are new or which have lately come into greater prominence. I would listthese as follows:  (a) The entry of Turkey into the Middle East as a firm ally.(b) Financial considerations may well necessitate the reduction of the forces which we are able to maintain in the Middle East in peace-time.Furthermore, forces deployed in the Middle East in the first six monthsof war may be smaller than previously envisaged.(c) We are making some progress towards the setting up of the Middle east defence Organisation. This is now designed in the first instance asa planning organisation, and references in our earlier instructions with.M. Ambassador to a Supreme Allied Commander and a Middle east command are therefore now inappropriate. If, however, further pro-gress is to be made with the establishment of the proposed Organisation,We should try to ensure that any solution Of Anglo-Egyptiaft problemsshould fit in with the form of that organisation.(d) The emergence of the new regime in Egypt may offer us a better chanceof coming to terms than we have had in the past.6.   General Neguib has not displayed any haste to enter into discussions with us on defence, and indeed has hitherto indicated that he would prefer to deal withinternal Egyptian problems first.  H.M. Ambassador at Cairo, however, is anxious not to miss any opportunity which may offer, and meanwhile to create an43108 B
2atmosphere of confidence which might improve the chances of success in any negotiations. Moreover, any discussion with the Egyptians of the Middle east defence Organisation is bound to precipitate an Egyptian request that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment define their attitude towards the continued presence of British forcesin the Canal Zone.7. I think, therefore, that it would be desirable to send some instructions atan early date to H.M. Ambassador at Cairo. The difficulty is that any instructions which we can send now may be invalidated by the new factors which have arisen,particularly (a) and (b) in paragraph 5: above. These two considerations have, Iunderstand, made it necessary to review in detail our whole strategy in the middle east. This review is now proceeding, and it may&apos; emerge that a base in Egypt,although desirable, is no longer absolutely essential.-. We should not in my viewembark upon negotiations in which, by insisting upon requirements for ourselveswhich are unacceptable to the egyptians, we risk a major breach with Egypt andthe Arab world, only to discover that those requirements are no longer essentialto the defence of the Middle East. The most important thing therefore is tocomplete as soon as possible the necessary studies of our strategic and financialneeds, in order that in the light of them we may reconsider our whole policy towardsEgypt- &apos;   ., &apos;   &quot; . ,8. Meanwhile, however, since1 we must proceed on the assumption that theEgypt base is a desirable asset until we have reconsidered our position as I havesuggested, I think that the principles which should for the present continue to guideus should be as follows:-(i) We should not for the moment withdraw any troops from the Canal Zone.But, if at some future-date we do start discussions with Egypt on defence,we should start withdrawing the reinforcements over and above thenormal garrison as soon as these discussions make real progress andwhen we are satisfied that RODEO will no longer be required.Moreover, we should be prepared, as we were last spring,to withdraw the mobile land forces constituting the normalgarrison in return for a satisfactory agreement with Egypt onthe lines set out in paragraphs. (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) below. It wouldprobably be necessary to withdraw these forces within one year fromthe conclusion of an agreement with Egypt (I understand that it wouldin any case take eighteen months to move the Headquarters, calculatedfrom the date of any decision to do so; I recommend therefore that thisdecision should be taken as soon as possible).(ii) We should seek to maintain the base installations and stores in existence.As part of a general settlement, and once we were assured of genuineEgyptian co-operation, we could agree to place responsibility forguarding the base on the Egyptian authorities. A joint Anglo-EgyptianBoard could be set up as a co-ordinating authority to resolve many problems of administrative control. The installations and stores whichare an essential part of the maintenance of British forces should remainin the ownership of and under the control of the British.(iii) We should agree to set.up an Anglo-Egyptian air defence organisation.This should, if possible, include British units. It must be recognisedthat if we are to keep British fighter squadrons in Egypt we must beallowed to retain the necessary British personnel for their maintenance.(iv) Egypt should agree to give us and our allies associated with us in theMiddle East Defence Organisation full military facilities in time of war or imminent menace of war.(v) Any new agreement with Egypt should be regarded as superseding the1936 Treaty.9. We may also have to be prepared, at some stage, to make available to egypt the arms and equipment for which she is asking, including jet aircraft andCenturion tanks. The Cabinet has recently authorized the release of up to 15Meteor aircraft to Egypt as a gesture of confidence.10. These principles should be used only as guidance by H.M. ambassador at Cairo, if he finds it impossible to avoid some preliminary discussion withthe Egyptians before our own further studies to which I have referred are ready.He should of course be warned that these studies are on the way:

I therefore recommend ri;. ^(a^That^the further, studies referred to should be carried out as a. matter of. , -urgencyjand that our policy should then be reconsidered in the light ofthem;,:y (6),that H.M. Ambassador at Cairo should be warned that these studies are being carried out and; that meanwhile he should so far as possibleavoid discussions with the Egyptian Government on the possibility ofthe withdrawal of British troops from the Canal Zone and the futureof the base there;(c) that if it pro,yes impossible to avoid all discussions, without arousing... Egyptian resentment, H.M. Ambassador should meanwhile be guided by the principles laid down in paragraph 8 above;(d) that he should in any case do his utmost to keep the Egyptians in playpending the reconsideration of our policy which I have recommended.A.

ANNEXIt will be remembered that last spring;we had protracted discussions withsuccessive Egyptian Governments with a view to reaching agreement upon Anglo-Egyptian defence problems and the future of . the Sudan. I do not think itis necessary to recount in detail the course of these discussions, which in the eventproved abortive, but I should like to recall briefly the nature of the instructions which we then sent to H.M. Ambassador at Cairo.In my memorandum to the Cabinet C. (52) 32 of 11th February, I recom-mended that we should resume negotiations with the Egyptian Government on thebasis that we should be prepared if necessary to agree that British mobile land forces should be withdrawn from the Canal Zone within one year, conditional upona settlement satisfactory to us of other outstanding points, such as the future of the base, the creation.of a joint air defence organisation, and Egyptian participation inthe proposed Middle East Command carrying with it the grant of full facilities to allied forces in time of war or imminent menace of war. These recommendations were discussed in the Cabinet on 14th February and again on 18th February (C. (52)17th, 18th and 19th Conclusions Minutes 4, 5 and 2 respectively). As a result ofthese discussions a despatch (No. 65 of 20th February) to H.M. Ambassador in cairo was approved by the Cabinet. This despatch instructed H.M. ambassador to seek an agreement with Egypt on the following lines:  (1) If agreement could be reached upon the establishment of an Allied middle east Command, with Egypt&apos;s participation as a founder membertherein, only such British land forces would remain in Egypt as were considered by the Supreme Allied Commander, Middle East, in agree-ment with the Egyptian military authorities, to be necessary to sustain the Egyptian land forces available for the defence of Egypt and themaintenance of the international waterway of the Suez Canal.(2) Hex Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome the opportunity of withdrawingother forces which the emergency had compelled them to move to the canal Zone.(3) The Egyptian armed forces would assume the task of providing for thesecurity from land and air attack, and for the local safeguarding, of theAllied military base and the Suez Canal. In this they would be aided by such forces as the Allied Middle East Command might consider necessary. The important military base installations on the Suez Canalwould pass under the Allied Middle East Command, of which egypt would be a founder member, provided that all stores and munitions,including machine tools, which have been provided at British expensewould remain British property to be disposed of as circumstances might require in the common interest, Great Britain being credited with any contribution made at her expense. ^(4) The United Kingdom would retain in Egypt such technical and adminis-trative personnel as were required to maintain at a state of operationalreadiness British military equipment held in the Allied military base.(5) The overall direction of the air defence would be vested in the Allied middle east Command, operating through an Allied Air Defence Organisation.. This would be stationed in Egypt together with any necessary personnel,including troops for their defence, which might be considered by theSupreme Allied Commander, Middle East, in agreement with the- Egyptian military authorities, to be necessary to supplement theEgyptian air forces and ground protection forces available.(6) Her Majesty&apos;s Government would undertake, in common with such other participating members of the Middle East Command as were in aposition to do so, to facilitate the training and equipment of the:: Egyptian armed forces to assume the responsibilities referred to above.(7) As soon as satisfactory arrangements had been concluded between theAllied Command and the Egyptian military authorities about theorganisation of the base and its defence, Her Majesty&apos;s Government:    would agree to regard the 1936 Treaty as superseded and would be&apos; glad to enter, either singly or in concert with the other Allied Powers,into a new Treaty of Alliance with Egypt in harmony with the spirit-. : which animates the nations of the free world to join together in voluntarydefensive co-operation.
dj (8) In consideration of the foregoing and in recognition of the overriding need to consolidate the defences of the Middle East, the Egyptian Govern-ment would agree to participate in the Allied Middle East Commandon a footing of equality with the founder members. -(9) The Egyptian Government would agree that in the event of war or imminentmenace of war Egypt would grant the forces of the Allied Middle East.^Command all the necessary facilities and assistance. Meanwhile,; she would agree to grant the customary personal and fiscal facilities to suchAllied military personnel and war material as required to be located in Egypt in time of peace: - -; 1(10) The two Governments Would agree to pursue as a matter of urgency andin consultation with the other Powers concerned further discussions on \military and political levels to give effect to the foregoing.I subsequently circulated to the Cabinet a further memorandum, C. (52) 63,:;which was discussed at the Cabinet on 12th March, 1952 (C. (52) 29th Conclusions,Minute 7).   As a result, H.M. Ambassador was instructed by telegram (Foreign&apos;Office telegram No. 506) that the basis upon which he should seek to reach agree-ment should be (a) An Egyptian agreement in principle to participate in the Allied middle east Command on the lines laid down in despatch No. 65 already referred to. &apos; &apos;(b) Egyptian agreement to the retention in Egypt by us of such technical andadministrative personnel as might be required to maintain at a stateof operational readiness British military equipment held in the proposedAllied military base, and the establishment of an Allied air defence organisation in Egypt.(c) In return, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to withdrawprogressively from Egypt, within a limited period to be determined,mobile fighting units of the British land forces. Such withdrawal wouldbe subject to any future agreement between the Supreme allied commander, Middle East, and the Egyptian military authoritiesregarding the retention in Egypt of forces placed under the allied military command. In addition, H.M, Ambassador was authorisedto inform the Egyptian Government that, if a satisfactory agreementwith Egypt on defence could be reached, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould make a special effort to provide arms and equipment for theEgyptian forces.These instructions providing for the withdrawal of all mobile fighting unitsof the British land forces, on certain conditions, were despatched following the replacement of the Government of Aly Maher by the Government of Hilali, whichwas considered to be an improvement on the former. In the event, however, Hilaliproved reluctant to enter into negotiations unless he could first obtain from us apublic statement of our intentions which he could represent as broadly satisfyingEgyptian aspirations. There followed protracted discussions with Hilali about the wording of the required formula, and H.M. Ambassador at Cairo was authorisedto agree to a formula recording that we and the Egyptian Government had decidedto enter into negotiations in order to settle the differences between the two countries on the basis of the withdrawal of British forces and the substitution of alternative arrangements for the defence of Egypt to those at present subsisting. Varioussubsequent modifications of this formula were discussed, and agreement on the final form had almost been reached, but no agreement proved possible on the formularelating to the Egyptian claim that King Farouk should be regarded as King ofthe Sudan. Talks were still going on over this Sudan formula when Hilali resignedowing to Egyptian Court intrigues and was replaced by Sirry Pasha.Oh 23rd July, 1952, General Neguib, the present Prime Minister of Egypt,carried out his coup d&apos; tat. Aly Maher became Prime Minister and King Faroukwas forced to abdicate. The new Egyptian Government, with General Neguib anda military junta of junior officers as the real power behind it, came in with theavowed purpose of purging Egyptian official life of corruption andinstituting much-needed agrarian and other reforms. The Government, however, met with con-siderable difficulties and on 7th September Aly Maher resigned and General Neguibtook over as Prime Minister as1 well as Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptianforces.
