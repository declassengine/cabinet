Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   g QC. (52) 35120th October, 1952CABINETTHE SOVEREIGNS ACCESSION DECLARATION AT THE OPENINGOF parliament memorandum by the Lord Chancellor&apos;It is the combined effect of Section 1 of the Bill of Rights, Section 2 of theAct of Settlement and the Accession Declaration Act, 1910 (10 Ed. 7 &amp; 1 Geo. 5,c. 29) that at the Opening of Parliament on 4th November, the Queen must make,subscribe and audibly repeat a Declaration worded in accordance with the Scheduleto the last-mentioned Act.  The Schedule is as follows:  &quot; I [here insert the name of the Sovereign] do solemnly and sincerely in thepresence of God profess, testify, and declare that I am a faithful Protestant,and that I will, according to the true intent of the enactments which -securethe Protestant succession to the Throne of my Realm, uphold and main-tain the said enactments to the best of my powers according to law.&quot;2.   There are two points:  (1) The words &quot; of my realm &quot; were omitted from the Declaration as made byGeorge VI in 1937.  Should they be omitted on this occasion?(2) Should the Queen describe herself as &quot; Elizabeth &quot; or as &quot; Elizabeth theSecond&quot;?I. The Omission of the Words &quot; of my Realm &quot;3. The omission of the words &quot; of my Realm &quot; in 1937 was deliberately done,in consequence of a Cabinet decision recorded in Minute 4 of the Conclusionsof the 7th Meeting of 1937. The Cabinet had considered a document headed&quot; Third Report of Cabinet Committee,&quot; signed on behalf of the Committee byMr. Ramsay MacDonald as Chairman (CP. (37) 5.1). Part III, which deals withthe Accession Declaration, refers first to the question whether it should be taken at the Coronation, and continues:  &quot; As regards the wording of the Declaration, the Attorney-General has been consulted on the question of leaving out the words &quot; of my Realm.&quot; he thinks that the omission of these words could be justified as a result ofthe change effected by the Statute of Westminster in relation to the positionof the Dominions. The words &quot; of my Realm &quot; were appropriate when there was in all senses one single realm. They might reasonably be saidto be inappropriate in present circumstances and may lead to objectionsbeing raised by some Dominion Governments; therefore the committee recommend their omission.&quot;There is no reference to this point in the Minute of the Cabinet Meeting,except that in the conclusions, the Cabinet agreed (a) to approve also the omission as recommended by the Coronation OathCommittee of the words &quot; of my Realm.&quot;43062
4. The Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers of the day advised that thestatutory form of the Coronation Oath could be varied, without the specificauthority of amending legislation, to take account of constitutional changes whichhad taken place since its form was first prescribed. They argued that &quot; if a statuteis passed altering the constitutional position of this country in such a way as torender the words of the original Oath no longer applicable, that Act may be treatedas impliedly authorising, and indeed requiring, a corresponding alteration in the wording of the Oath.&quot; The same argument was held to justify the omission of thewords &quot; of my Realm &quot; from the Accession Declaration.On the point of law I do not dissent from my predecessor^ opinion. On the merits, the reason for omitting these words is more cogent now than it was in 1937;for the degree of independence of the Dominions has grown steadily in fact,&apos; if notin law, and new Dominions have come into being. The omission appears to haveoccasioned no comment in 1937, and it may pass unnoticed now.We think, on balance, that the words ought to be omitted on this occasion.II. The Queen&apos;s Description5.   The recent precedents vary.Edward VII said: &quot; I, Edward, do solemnly .... &amp;c.&quot;George V said: &quot; I, George, do solemnly .... &amp;c.&quot;Edward VIII said: &quot; I, Edward the Eighth, do solemnly .... &amp;c.&quot;George VI said: &quot; I, George the Sixth, do solemnly .... &amp;c.&quot;We have not been able to trace the reason for the transition from &quot; I, George. . . .&quot; to &quot; I, Edward the Eighth . . . .&quot;, nor can we find any analogy from other documents. The Oath which the Queen takes under Article XXV of the Union ofEngland and Scotland Act, 1706 (6 Anne C. 11) begins: &quot; I, Elizabeth the Second,by the Grace of God, &amp;c.&quot; The whole of the Royal Style and Titles is included.This is not required by the Act which does not set out the words of the Oath inoratio recta. The Schedule to the Act of 1910 requires the name of the Sovereignto be inserted, but not the Title.We think that the matter is one for the Queen&apos;s personal choice but we prefer the earlier precedents to the later, on the ground that the name of the Queen isi&quot;Elizabeth&quot; and not &quot;Elizabeth the Second.&quot; The description &quot;Elizabeth&quot;would also be more acceptable to opinion in Scotland than &quot; Elizabeth the Second.&quot;SIMONDS.Lord Chancellors Office, S.W. 1,26th October, 1952.
