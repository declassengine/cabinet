Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (52) 36727th October, 1952CABINETTELEVISION AT THE CORONATIONMemorandum by the Prime minister am concerned at the public disappointment caused by the announcement that there would be no television of the Coronation east of the Screen in West-minster Abbey. Together with certain of my Cabinet colleagues I have discussed this matter informally with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Earl Marshal andthe Queen&apos;s Private Secretary. As a result I am satisfied that the earlier decision should be reviewed and that, subject to The Queen&apos;s approval and convenience,some parts of the actual ceremony within the Screen should be televised.-*2.   I commend the following principles for consideration by the Cabinet:  (i) No differentiation should be made between those parts of the ceremonyto be televised and those to be filmed.. (ii) The anointing of The Queen, the Prayer of Consecration and theSacrament itself should be excluded from both the films and television.(iii) No &quot; close-up &quot; views of The Queen should be photographed, filmed ortelevised at any stage of the ceremony.(iv) Subject to (ii) and (iii) above, faeilitiestbt televise the proceedings beyondthe Screen should be granted, on the general understanding thattelevision should furnish no more intimate a view than that whichwould be available to a spectator seated east of the Screen in the Abbey.(v) Permission to televise should be subject to approval by the appropriate authorities of the technical arrangements for the placing of the camerasand the handling of the transmission.
3. If the Cabinet endorse these principles, I will so inform the Earl Marshalwho would, after consulting the Coronation Joint Committee, seek the approvalof the Coronation Commission and the Coronation Committee of the Privy council for a suitable submission to The Queen.4. I take this opportunity to make it clear that, contrary to reports which have appeared in the Press, the earlier recommendation of the Coronation JointCommittee against the use of television east of the Screen was submitted in writing to all the members of the Commission and of the Committee of the Privy Councilon 15th July, 1952. It was accompanied by a covering note to the effect that in theabsence of comment by 21st July it would be assumed that the Commission and theCommittee approved the recommendation.W. S.
