CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    6C. (52) 37530th October, 1952CABINETFRANCO-GERMAN relations note by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues may be interested to read the attached letter from Sir IvoneKirkpatrick, the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Germany, about theattitude of the Germans towards the French people.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,30th October, 1952.When the three Western Foreign Ministers met Dr. Adenauer in Londonnine months ago, Dr. Adenauer told M. Schuman with some truth that the germans were apt to be an arrogant people and that their arrogance was being fed by thespectacle of French terror of Germany. The Germans, he said, had taken a frightfulbeating during the war and were amazed to find that fifty million victoriousFrenchmen were shaking in their shoes in front of fifty million defeated, disarmed,and dispirited Germans.  It was all very bad for the Germans.I recall this incident because I am beginning to notice in Germany a growing,quite good-natured contempt for the French; the sort of contempt which heartysixteen-year-old boys have for timorous old ladies.Even in Hitler&apos;s early days of power the German General Staff had respect for the French Army and this in turn led to some brake being put on Germanplans and aspirations. I know we can do nothing to instil any courage or confidenceinto the French, but unless they can&apos; be a little more robust in their conduct ofaffairs they will soon create a situation in which Germany will regard them with complete contempt and cease to pay the slightest attention to anything they maysay.  This state of affairs will not conduce to French security.43137SiPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1952
