Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 57C. (52) 3834th November, 1952CABINETSAUDI ARABIAN FRONTIER dispute memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that I have previously referred to the activities of the saudi Arabian Government on the long disputed frontiers of the British protectedShaikhdoms in the Persian Gulf and of the Sultanate of Muscat (CC. (52) 84thConclusions, Minute 5).   Much of the territory involved is potentially oil bearing.2. The increasing wealth and prestige of King Ibn Saud have naturallyinclined the tribes in and around the disputed areas towards him rather thantowards our friends. This bias has been increased by Saudi money payments,particularly over the last three years. In early September, a Saudi representativewith armed guards was introduced into one of the sensitive areas and his improperactivities from his base at Buraimi (from which we have been unable to dislodgehim) combined with our restraint on the Sultan of Muscat, have started a land-slide towards the Saudi camp.   This landslide could be arrested by (a) use of force by our protected Shaikhs and the Sultan of Muscat againstthe tribes. This would undoubtedly lead ultimately to clashes withSaudi forces and is unacceptable;(b) increased money subsidies to the tribes by our Shaikhs and the Sultan.Funds would necessarily have to be provided by Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and/or the interested oil companies. In any case it is doubtfulwhether we could now overtake the Saudis in such a financial race.3. Since neither of the above courses is acceptable, the only alternativeappears to be the arbitration of the dispute by a neutral third party who would be bound to take account of historical facts and would not confine himself to factfinding on the present situation, which the Saudis have artificially and improperlycreated in very recent times.4.   Our chances under arbitration are fair:  (a) In the Persian Gulf area of Abu Dhabi new evidence has confirmed thatan arbitration award is likely to give us less than our maximumclaims but more than we are likely to get either by negotiation or by further continuation of the present stand-still arrangements. It ispossible, however, that a section of the east coast between Qatar andAbu Dhabi may be awarded to Ibn Saud.(b) In Muscat the situation is not too clear, and arbitration would be some-what of a leap in the dark. The Sultan has never effectively assertedhis authority in his territory. The Saudis have successfully weakenedthe already feeble allegiance to him. An award at arbitration may therefore cost the Sultan a certain amount of valuable territory in the oil area, but not so much as he will certainly lose by further delays in reaching a settlement.5. The oil concession for Saudi Arabia is held by ARAMCO (100 per cent.United States). The Iraq Petroleum Company (47 per cent. British 53 per cent,others) holds the concessions in the protected Shaikhdoms and Muscat.   If the43173
2arbitrator awards territory to Saudi Arabia, oil is not lost to the Western worldnor necessarily to British interests. It would go either to ARAMCO or to theCompanies which take up the areas being relinquished by ARAMCO in SaudiArabia.   These Companies could, I hope, be British or have British participation.6.   I have accordingly decided to offer arbitration to the Saudi Arabian, Government.   This offer is subject to the consent of our Shaikhs and the Sultanof Muscat which is being sought.   There may be some delay in getting a favourableanswer from the Sultan, but we must persevere.   I am also seeking american support for this course.Foreign Office, S.W.1,4th November, 1952.
