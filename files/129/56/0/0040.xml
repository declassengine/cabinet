(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL .C. (52) 390 COPY NO. M; -4th NQVEMBER, 1952.CABINETRECONSTRUCTION OF BLITZED CITY CENTRESMemorandum by the Minister of V/orks.There will be more steel, more cement and more bricks available for building next year.   The total of new construction is therefore expected torise.   It would be intolerable that this expansion should take place in thecountry as a whole while building in the Blitzed Cities was deliberatelyreduced.   These cities have deserved better than this.2.   I submit therefore that the Minister of Housing must be in a position totell the House of Commons that city by city the total of their new buildingnext year will at least equal this year&apos;s figure.   That part of their buildingwhich is covered by the Blitz City Programmes is expected to be  4. 5 millions this year.   It is proposed to reduce this to  2. 5 millions next year.   in what terms can the Minister promise that this  2 millions shortfall willbe made up?3.   There will be more houses.   In some cities there could be more industrial building.   But in the case of a city where it is not possible to show that these other kinds of building will at least make up the proposed cut in shops and offices and other much-wanted amenities, I think the investment ceilingfor Blitzed City work should be raised.4.   London is a special case where a programme of rebuilding in the city of London should now be started if unemployment is not to increase.5.   I hope therefore that on the lines of paragraph 5 of the Chancellor&apos;s paper C. (52) 385 considerable freedom will be allowed to feed in new workwherever further expansion is justified by the local situation in the buildingindustry, and that if houses and factories are not sufficient to maintainthe level of work we shall not hesitate to allow a few more of the war-scars tobe healed.D.E.Ministry of Works, S.E.1.4th November, 1952.
