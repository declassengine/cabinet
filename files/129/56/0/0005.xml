secret. (52) 355 COPY NO.      /Q21st OCTOBER, 1952.CABINETTRANSPORT bill memorandum by the Minister of transport and Civil AviationThere is full support in our Party and much elsewhere for therailway proposals in the Bill.   This support will be increased by the proposedeasement of railway restrictions.Because of this easement, the main justification for Part II of the levy goes.2. I am convinced that Part II of the levy should be completely dropped.I feel anyhow we may lose it during the Debate and then be left with a verypatchy Bill.Suspension of Part II has attractions, but it is almost equallydistasteful to trade and industry on whose support lifting railway restrictionslargely depends.3. If we drop Part II of the levy, we shall meet difficulties over Part I.About 70% of it will have to be raised from the rC* licensees who did not gainat all from the payment for goodwill.   This will be difficult to justify.4. For this and other reasons I urge broadly the course of action at(c) in Lord Leathers&apos; paper C. (52) 346.5. I recognise this raises some difficulties.(1)   Those subject to the 25 mile limit will be immediatelyfree to enter the long distance field, while(2)  it is said those ex-long distance hauliers anxious to come back(to whom we have also made promises) will have limitedopportunities of doing so.   But they will be helped in this way:-(a) many of them are now short distance hauliers, and so will get all the advantages of (1) above;(b) we propose in Clause 8 to make it easier for newcomers,who can show that they can provide a better service thanthose existing, to get a licence;(c) there is a substantial pool of &apos;C licence long distancetraffic which its owners should be willing to sell to them;
(d) they can buy up businesses of those hitherto limited to25 miles;(e) it would be a simple matter to provide that licencesshould be given to all individuals formerly operating aslong distance hauliers.   It would be a difficult matter todo so for companies and partnerships now dissolved.   Howeverconsideration could be g&amp;ren to drafting such a clause beforeCommittee stage.6. The results would be:-(1)    We drop both parts of the levy.(2)    We remove the 25 mile limit.(3)    We discharge both of our Election promises,, i. e. lifting of the25 mile limit and giving a chance to old long distancehauliers to re-enter.(4) Retain the Road Haulage Executive, but authorise it to sellits assets if it wishes, and subject it to the same controlsas private hauliers and to the spur of competition.7. We should thereby: -(1)    Drop the two features most obnoxious to our supporters, 25 mile limit, both parts of the levy, and wholly fulfil our Election pledges.(2)    Give private industry and the nationalised service, with nofavours on either side, an equal chance to prove themselves.(3)   Abandon the proposed auction which, if it is only partiallysuccessful, would damage us very much.8. I am confident this will please our supporters, commend itself to industry, divide the Socialist Party, make nonsense of their campaign of the&quot;Great sell-out&quot; and be far harder for a future Socialist Government to undo.A.L-E,Ministry of Transport, W. 1.21st October, 1952.
