The next three years are the crucial ones in our efforts to re-build our economic defences.    World and domestic opinion willjudge us in 1956 on the job we have done by then.2. Our external position is better than it was when we came into office, but it is still far from secure.     Our exports are dangerouslydown on my Budget Estimates.    They must have first claim on any additional resources we may have available.     Only by doing this can we get away from the succession of balance of payments crises, anddependence on United States Aid, which have marked the British economy since the end of the war.    Moreover, investment in industryin recent years has been kept far below the level which is necessary tomodernize our industry and keep up with our main competitors.    Alreadywe are losing contracts to Germany and Japan.     Unless we can keep down the burdens on the economy I see little prospect of being able to do any-thing in this field.    The claims of defence and industrial investment andof our best exports are directly and inescapably competitive;  they alldepend on the same sections of the engineering industry.3. I have never singled out defence as the only object for economy.My anxiety has been that we are attempting to carry a large and risinghousing programme, and a defence programme of a size unknown inpeace time.    We are in danger of continuing the practice of the previous government of adopting policies which inevitably commit the exchequer to carry increasing burdens in the years ahead.    In this way our resources are mortgaged in advance, and all prospect of escapingfrom our economic difficulties and developing our own line is inexorablydenied to us.4. Let us look at the prospect which faces us.    Expenditure nextyear looks certain to be much higher than this year&apos;s Budget Estimates.Increased civil expenditure, higher interest on the floating debt and loans to local authorities (mainly for    housing and schools) look likeinvolving us in an extra  175 millions compared with this year&apos;sfigure.    If we take the defence budget at the Minister&apos;s figure of 1,645 millions there is, even allowing for transfers between Votes, afurther     150 millions of increase here.    On the revenue side, I shall
Illget an extra  170 millions from the first year of Excess ProfitsLevy and the stopping of initial depreciation allowances (i. e. extraincome from what would be mainly savings of companies) but against this there will be falls of revenue due partly to the deflation which we ourselves have encouraged and partly to the full effects of the taxconcessions made in the last Budget.    Overall, the net worsening between this year and next is well over  300 millions.    I am prepared to proposeto my colleagues economies to cover about half this sum, but these will involve sacrifices in social policy.5. We have continually urged, and are still being strongly urged by our supporters, to hold down and reduce public expenditure of allkinds, primarily with the objective of making a start on the intolerabletax burden on industry.    A resolution to reduce expenditure was carriedat Scarborough despite my plea for understanding of the difficulties.    Solong as we accept the present level of taxation and are ready to incuradditional commitments up to that limit, we shall be denying a cardinalarticle of our economic and political faith and shall have lost anopportunity to serve the country&apos;s best interests.6. So far as concerns 1953/54 I am prepared, if my colleagues agree,to make the cuts mentioned in paragraph 4 above amounting to 180 millions or so on the understanding that defence expenditure makessome contribution.    We have already cut social and food subsidy expendi-ture last session.    It would surely be difficult to defend further socialcuts in Parliament if, after criticising the Socialist Government&apos;s defence plans for being too big, we come forward with proposals involving aconsiderable increase in defence expenditure.    I hope we shall bearthis in mind when we settle the defence estimates for 1953/54.7. Thereafter I would hope that we could plan a pattern of defence expenditure to which we can work during the precarious years in front of us without chopping and changing with every shift in economic circumstances.     This should be based on a considered view of theprobable cost, over a long period ahead, of the forces we are proposing to build, maintain and keep equipped with the best weapons;  but if it becomes plain, as I think it must, that we can only maintain the highest possible standard of equipment for our forces if their numbers are some-what less than now planned, we should at once review the situation and take the necessary steps to reduce numbers.8. I do not myself see how we can go on planning for armed forcesof over 850,000 men and women, with well over one million civiliansemployed in administering, maintaining and equipping them.    It wouldmean devoting indefinitely something like 10 per cent of the totalworking population to defence.9. It must be remembered that in addition to our enormous defence budget, we have to provide for  60 millions to  70 millions a year (andthat on a programme cut by over 40 per cent) for defence efforts of theCivil Departments, together with further sums for stockpiling, atomic energy and Ministry of Supply assistance to industry.    In all, the sumsrequired by the heeds of defence come to over one-third of our totalbudgetary expenditure above and below the line.10. Surely such a review, which should of course include the overseas commitments to which our defence expenditure is related, could be conducted without causing any offence or difficulty with other North
Atlantic Treaty Powers and with the U.S.A.    We know that the Americanprogramme is to level off next year.    There are signs that we shouldnot surprise the Continent if we actually reduced our defence effortfrom its present level.    There can surely be no just cause for complaintabroad if we do not go on increasing it.    At home we can hardly defend a  continually increasing burden, calling for yet further sacrifices, whenthe largest and most prosperous of the N.A.T.O. partners will havestopped increasing its effort.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.5TH NOVEMBER, 1952.
