Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1952CONFIDENTIALCopy No. 56C. (52) 3874th November, 1952CABINETCORPORAL PUNISHMENT AS A PENALTY FORCRIMES OF VIOLENCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland in considering the Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum about corporal punishment(C. (52) 386), my colleagues may wish to have before them a brief note about theposition in Scotland.2. The power to flog an adult for crimes of violence in Scotland was repealedin 1862. Between that date and the complete abolition of flogging as a judicialpenalty by the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, on 13th September, 1948, Scottish courtswere empowered to award it, in the case of an adult, only on a second conviction of living on the immoral earnings of a woman or for assault on the Sovereign.The last award was in 1932. Boys could be whipped, under either common orstatute law, until 1948 : but as in England diminishing use was made of this penaltyin the preceding years. The numbers in the years 1945 to 1947 were 36, 33, and 7.In prisons, flogging could be ordered as a penalty only for mutiny or grave assaultson warders by convicts in Peter head Prison. It was last used in .1934, and onlyonce in the twenty years before the power to award it was repealed by the criminla justice (Scotland) Act, 1949.3. To empower the Scottish courts to use corporal punishment as a penalty for crimes of violence committed by adults would thus mean a reversion to 1862.Such a step would be criticised by many people as retrograde and would clearlyrequire strong justification. This is not provided by recent statistics. The total numbers of crimes of violence in Scotland in recent years have been An analysis of these figures is given in the appendix.4. The penalties of corrective training and preventive detention were not brought into force in Scotland until May 1952. There has therefore been no timeto gauge their effect: and I think it would be reasonable to give them a fair trialbefore considering the case for introducing corporal punishment as a penalty forcrimes of violence in Scotland. If, however, that case is to be considered in England-it will be necessary to bring Scotland also within the scope of any Royal commissioner Departmental Committee appointed for the purpose.1948194919501951X X ... ...1952 (six months)1,3021,1231,1121,373563J.
