Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952CONFIDENTIALC. (52) 37229th October, 1952CABINETCOUNCIL OF EUROPE: PROTOCOL TO THE GENERAL agreement on PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs wish to bring the following development to the notice of my colleagues:  2. Shortly after the Council of Europe was set up in 1949, a General Agree-ment was signed conferring certain privileges and immunities on representatives and officials connected with the CounciFs work. This now needs to be brought up to date.3. A draft Protocol has been prepared and is now ready for signature. its main objects are (a) to extend the provisions of the General Agreement to cover (i) representatives of member Governments attending meetings in theintervals between sessions of the Committee of Ministers;(ii) Assembly representatives attending committee meetings when theAssembly itself is not in session;(b) to define the diplomatic status of Permanent Representatives accreditedby member Governments to the Council of Europe.4. The Protocol accords no new privileges and immunities. It merely extendsthe privileges and immunities already granted in respect of certain meetings to thesame categories of persons (Ministers, Members of Parliament and officials) attend-ing meetings at times other than those originally provided for. This extension ofthe provisions of the General Agreement has been made necessary by the con-siderable expansion in the work of the Council of Europe, and in particular of its committees, during the past three years.5. Before the Protocol can be put into effect in the United Kingdom, a new order in Council, or an amendment to an existing one, will be required. Councilof Europe meetings normally take place in Strasbourg or Paris. It is thereforeunlikely that we shall be called on to accord the privileges and immunities granted by the Protocol except on rare occasions.6. When, in August, my colleagues discussed the question of privileges and immunities for international organisations (C.C. (52) 75th Conclusions, Minute 6),they asked to be given notice of any new proposal to extend privileges and immuhi-ties to international agencies. Although, strictly speaking, the present Protocoldoes not come within this category, my colleagues will no doubt wish to take note of this development.7. I am arranging for my Deputy to sign the Protocol on behalf of her majesty&apos;s Government at a meeting in Strasbourg early in November.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,29th October, 1952.6743129
