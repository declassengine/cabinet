Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952CONFIDENTIALC (52) 36024th October, 1952CABINETENFORCEMENT OF FOOD controls memorandum by the Minister of FoodWhen the Cabinet (C.C. (52) 67th Conclusions, Minute 4) considered raymemorandum C. (52) 215,1 was asked to continue to examine methods of reducingthe number of enforcement officers. I have examined in close detail the way inwhich the enforcement effort has been deployed. It is primarily directed againstoffences which threaten supplies of rationed food and the rationing system itself,and most of the time of Inspectors is spent in handling specific complaints fromthe public.2. During the past year a number of minor controls, particularly pricecontrols, have been eliminated. Flour, confectionery, biscuits, soap, many meatproducts and coffee have been de-controlled. Tea has been de-rationed. unfortunate-nately these relaxations only touch the fringes of enforcement work. For example,less than 2 per cent, of the Inspectors&apos; time has been devoted to tea rationing. but every abolition of control helps, and these recent changes will enable me to reducethe enforcement staff by about 5 per cent. It would not be wise to go further forthe moment.3. But I hope that within the next few months we may be able to do away with more significant controls. The Economic Policy Committee will shortly be considering proposals to end control over eggs, and I hope before long to tacklesweets rationing. Such developments as these would afford real scope for economy in enforcement, and it may be that other similar developments are not too far off.For instance, the time is ripe for very careful examination of the need for continuedcontrol of cereals and feeding stuffs. Of course, a real improvement in our ability to buy food overseas could produce dramatic results.4.   The present disposition of the Inspectorate is shown in the Appendix.G.
