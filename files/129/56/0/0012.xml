Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   gC. (52) &quot;36224th October, 1952.cabinet situation IN TURKEYNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the record of a recentconversation with the retiring Canadian Ambassador in Ankara.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1, .24th October, 1952. -General Odium, the retiring Canadian Ambassador in Ankara, called at theForeign Office on 19th September and gave Mr. Harrison an account of hisimpressions of the situation in Turkey.2. The Turks, said General Odium, were convinced that there would be awar, though they could not specify when. They would fight and give a goodaccount of themselves. Their army had made enormous strides in the last five yearsand was now an efficient fighting force. Its one failing was lack of decentralisation,every decision being submitted to the Chief of Staff. For example, no air unitcould take off without his authority. Owing to the state of communications, theTurkish army was not very mobile. In war, it would fulfil a mainly static role, butthe Turkish troops would fight to the death.3. Turning to the general strategic picture, General Odium said that theTurks saw themselves in the centre of the stage. They believed that they were inthe front-line and would bear the brunt of the Soviet attack which was certainly tobe directed, not so much on Western Europe, as on the Bosphorous, the Suez canal and the Persian Gulf. They despised all their neighbours, Arabs, Greeks and italians alike, and had no opinion of their will or capacity to resist aggression.They were not prepared to enter into any commitments towards such neighboursfrom which they themselves could not possibly derive any advantages in return.The only people they took seriously were the Americans and ourselves. their approach to the problem of Middle East defence was essentially realist. If plans were made which provided for the allocation of, say, ten outside divisions for thedefence of the Middle East, the Turks on their side would be prepared to allocateforces for service in the area; but at present they did not see where those tendivisions would come from. The United Kingdom forces in Egypt were too small;they knew that no American forces were allocated to the area; and they doubted the ability of the Commonwealth to make up the deficiency. If, however, we couldconvince the Turks that forces would be forthcoming, then it would be easy to dobusiness with them, and we should find them willing to co-operate in defence plans.43099
4. General Odium said he thought that responsible Turks realised that Thrace was indefensible, and that their enthusiastic support of Field-MarshalMontgomery&apos;s ideas for defending Thrace was due to the fact that this offered thefirst opportunity of discussing defence plans with the Americans and ourselves andobtaining assurances of outside assistance.5. General Odium said that, despite misunderstandings, the Turks respectedthe British and recognised the Commonwealth concept. They realised that our interest in the Middle East was a permanent and continuing factor. Their doubt,and it was a serious one, was whether we disposed of the strength to maintain it.6. The Turkish attitude towards the United States was, so to speak, the reverse. They were very conscious of the United States as a source of. financialassistance and military equipment. But they doubted whether the Americanscould be relied upon to maintain their interest in the Middle East or to accept long-term commitments in that area. The influence of General Arnold (the head ofthe United States Military Mission in Ankara) was definitely on the wane sincedirect contacts had been established between the Turks and N.A.T.O., and it seemed likely that the United States Military Mission would be withdrawn by theend of 1953. The present Ambassador, Mr. McGhee, was a great improvement on his predecessor, Mr. Wadsworth, and Anglo-American relations in Ankara hadparticularly benefited from the change.7. As regards Turkish personalities, General Odium said that the PrimeMinister was head and shoulders above any of his colleagues and was the onlyman who really counted. Similarly, in the military sphere the Chief of Staff wasthe outstanding personality.
