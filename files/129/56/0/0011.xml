hoPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1952CONFIDENTIALC. (52) 36124th October, 1952CABINETCHRISTMAS FOOD BONUSES AND RATIONSMemorandum by the Minister of food shall be called upon at an early date to make a statement in the House about our intentions as to food bonuses at Christmas. I shall also have to announcecertain ration, changes in normal course.General Ration policy .   I have two policy objectives constantly in mind:  (a) to decontrol and de-ration wherever possible without causing a scramblefor supplies and disproportionate price increases;(b) to maintain rations where they have to be continued at the highest possibleeven level.3. Where bonuses, whether at Christmas or other periods of the year, conflict with these objectives, whatever the short-term appeal, the advantages and dis-advantages have to be very carefully weighed.Christmas Bonuses4. Christmas bonuses started effectively in 1944 and continued throughsix years of the late Government. None was given last year. When given, theyhave at one time or another covered almost all rationed foods except cheese. Butit has been the general experience that any packet of bonuses is judged by thepublic largely by what is done for sugar and tea and to a lesser extent for fats andsweets.  This year tea, of course, does not come into the picture.Sugar Bonuses5. This year we have sustained the sugar ration at the relatively high levelof 10 oz. with three 1 lb. bonuses-the last scraped from savings on manufacturingsupplies. We are planning on the same basis for next year.6. I could only provide a sugar bonus of 1 lb. at Christmas within my present programme by planning to reduce bonus issues next year to two at most.This would be unpopular when the time came. If, therefore, it is thought necessaryto give a sugar bonus at Christmas I should have to ask for authority to buy some25,000 to 30,000 tons of dollar sugar at a cost of just under  1 million... Sweets7.   Fairly early in the New Year I may be able to abolish the rationing ofsweets saving incidentally some 500 staff.   Without an additional allocation of43098Copy No;6 3
sugar to the sweets manufacturers some 20,000 to 30,000 tons is at issue there might be some fairly sharp price increases on de-rationing. I should, however, bevery reluctant to buy extra sugar for sweets or to divert one of the consumer bonusesplanned for next year. The latter would be a very unpopular step. But in any casethe granting of a Christmas sweets bonus would put off the prospect of derationingfor a considerable time and I could not therefore recommend it. I shall be bringing the general question of de-rationing sweets to the Cabinet shortly.8.   I deal with the fats position below.Christmas RationsButter and Margarine9. I can raise the butter ration from 2 oz. to 3 oz. from 30th November.If we are to keep within our import programme the margarine ration must comedown by 1 oz. at the same time, keeping the total fats ration at 9 oz. To postpone the reduction in margarine until the end of the year (equivalent to a Christmasfats bonus of 4 oz.) would cost in non-sterling currency about  \ million.Cheese10. I can put up the cheese ration from .1 oz. to \\ oz. from 25th January and maintain it there through the summer. This could be announced at the same time as the butter increase.Meat11. Subject to what is said below about sausages, if we get a satisfactory settlement with Argentina in good time we can probably have a minimum meat ration.of about Is. 9d. from 30th November right through until the end of June1953. If we continue with the present 2s. ration (which is sustained largely on thehome kill until end of November) to the end of this year we shall use an additional15,000 tons of meat from store which will take away id. from the ration for mostof the first half of next year. Whatever happens in the Argentine negotiations,therefore, we should reduce the meat ration to Is. 9d. on 30th November.; 12. I have it in mind to free sausages from price control and to make avail?able to manufacturers a considerable increase in the quantity of good meat for making sausages. This would make a wider range of sausages freely available at all times. It would cost us about \d. worth of meat from the ration but would, Ibelieve, be so much appreciated by the public that it would be worth while.Whether this can. be done or not depends on a satisfactory settlement with argentina.13. The delay in reaching agreement with the Argentine, due primarily to difficulties about credit terms, is beginning to be disturbing. If we get no meat atall during the next few months from there the meat ration for the first half of 1953would be no more than Is. Ad. If I am to avoid an even lower ration than this inthe late spring of 1953,1 must soon be able to see meat moving from Argentina orI must reduce the ration even below Is. 9d. to conserve our stocks of meat.Bacon1 14. We hope, with some difficulty, to maintain the 5 oz. ration until the NewYear when, owing to the normal seasonal fall in supplies, it will probably have to fall to 4 oz. for a period. There are, however, adequate supplies of cooked hamand gammon off the ration. ,Unrationed Christmas Fare15. Supplies of poultry, particularly of turkeys, are likely to be better and prices lower than in 1951. Supplies of dried fruit are also likely to be better than for several years past. Canned fruit supplies are likely to be satisfactory but nutswill probably be scarce. While supplies of oranges and lemons should be adequate,apples, tangerines and grapes will be in shorter supply owing to import cuts.
Summary16. If my colleagues decide that a sugar bonus of 1 lb. should be given I ask authority:  (a) to purchase between 25,000&apos;and 30,000 tons of sugar at a cost of just under 1 million in dollars.I also ask authority:  (b) to increase the butter ration to 3 oz. on 30th November and, subject to thepossible postponement by one month at a cost of million mentionedin paragraph 9, to reduce the margarine ration by .1 oz. on the same date;(c) to increase the cheese ration to 1-V oz. on 25th January, 1953;(d) to reduce the meat ration from 2s. to Is. 9d. on 30th November.I should propose to announce all these changes together as late in Novemberas administrative arrangements will permit.G. Ll-G.Ministry of Food, S.W. 1,24th October, 1952.
