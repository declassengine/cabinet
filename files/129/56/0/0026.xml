It is issued for the personal use of ........................................TOP SECRET Copy No.       51C. (52) 37631st October, 1952CABINETCOMMONWEALTH ECONOMIC conference memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs. The &quot; Collective Approach &quot; to Multilateral Trade and PaymentsAt a series of meetings during the Recess the Committee on Preparations forthe Commonwealth Economic Conference agreed that any policy put forward by the United Kingdom Government at the Conference should be based upon areaffirmation of the long-term objective of attaining a multilateral trading andfinancial system covering the free world.2. We then considered possible courses of action leading towards this objective. Here there was a divergence of view between the members of theCommittee. This was not a difference on the objective, but on the method and timing of the steps to be taken to reach it.3. The Committee agreed, however, that at the Preparatory Meeting of commonwealth Officials the United Kingdom delegation should put forward ascheme for concerted action by the Commonwealth, the United States and the,leading countries of Western Europe designed to create the trading and paymentsconditions necessary to stabilise and strengthen the world economy, of which the convertibility of sterling and other currencies would be an integral part. This hascome to be known as &quot; the collective approach.&quot; It was emphasised that the presentation of this scheme did not in any way bind Ministers, and that, ifalternative proposals were put forward, they should be carefully examined.4. The Preparatory Meeting has now been concluded, and I have circulatedto my colleagues reports (C.E.C. (O) (52) 22 to 25 and C.E.C. (O) (H.D.) (52) 1),approved by all the delegations, which show the stage reached in the discussions between officials. The problem of convertibility is discussed at length in the reporton Finance and Trade (C.E.C. (O) (H.D.) (52) 1).5. This report has been carefully examined by my Committee. We agreedthat, broadly speaking, a choice must now be made between the three followingcourses:  (i) To abandon the idea of proposals for a collective approach, on theground that they involved so many risks that we should not even put them forward at the Commonwealth Economic Conference inNovember.43145*     B
(ii) To put forward the collective approach proposals without modification,in the form in which they had been discussed, without commitment, atthe official talks.(iii) To put forward the collective approach proposals at the Conference with modifications, made in the light of the views expressed by the Com-commonwealth officials. (The proposals so modified are set out in the annex.)In considering these alternatives we recognised that there were risks and difficulties in the &quot; collective approach &quot; proposals. But we believe that the risks and difficulties in abandoning the proposals are no less.6. It is most important that the United Kingdom Government should take an effective lead at the Commonwealth Economic Conference. For this purpose it is urgently necessary that we should decide now what proposals on this subjectwe shall put forward before the Conference and inform Commonwealth Govern-ments accordingly, so that they may have time to discuss these before their PrimeMinisters (or other representatives) leave for London.7. The general opinion in my Committee was that the United KingdomGovernment should put forward the &quot; collective approach &quot; proposals, as modified,as the basis for the discussion at the Commonwealth Economic Conference. Weshould put these proposals forward with the knowledge that further modificationswill probably have to be made after discussion with the other commonwealth governments in November, and that, if the scheme is discussed thereafter with theUnited States and the leading European countries, still further modifications maywell have to be made as a result. Final decisions could not in any event be taken until after the negotiations with the United States and Western Europe had beencompleted. The final judgment must remain in our own hands, and when we cometo make it we must be clear that the conditions are satisfactory.8. My Committee therefore recommend that the Cabinet should agree thatthese proposals be communicated forthwith to Commonwealth Governments as thebasis for the discussion in the Commonwealth Economic Conference, on the under-standing that no final decisions can be taken until after the discussions with theUnited States and the leading European countries have been completed.II.   Gold10. Certain questions about gold policy will also be raised at the Conferencein November.My Committee have agreed upon the line to be taken by the United KingdomGovernment in discussion of these questions. The Chancellor of the Exchequerwill make an oral report to the Cabinet on this.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,31st October, 1952.
annex the &quot; Collective Approach &quot; to Multilateral Trade and payments. This note sets out the general lines of a course of action, to be taken inco-operation with the rest of the Commonwealth, the United States, arid the leadingWestern European countries, to create trading and payments conditions necessaryto stabilise and strengthen the world economy, of which the convertibility of sterling and. other currencies would be an integral part. It is based on the note put in tothe Preparatory Meeting of Commonwealth Officials by the United kingdom delegation (Annex III to C.E.C. (O) (HD) (52) 1, circulated under cover ofC. (52) 373), and incorporates the modifications now proposed.2. &quot;Convertibility of sterling&quot; is here taken in a limited sense, arid meansorily that all sterling ftewly acquired by non-residents of the sterlirig area after thedate of the operation would be convertible, at a flexible sterling-dollar rate.Exchange controf would continue to apply as at present to all transactions with non-residents of the sterling area by residents of the United Kingdom and of other sterling area countries.Internal- Policies3. It is assumed as is essential for ali plans for convertibility, and, indeed,for maintainirig sterlirig inconvertible without crisis that all sterling area countriestake effective action, both in internal and external policy, to keep the sterling area&apos;balance of payments with the rest of the world in a strong and healthy condition;and it is assumed that there will be, in particular:  (a) A tight hold on credit.(b) Policies on investment and domestic consumption which prevent excessiveimporting and leave room for a volume of exports adequate to carryout whatever objective may be appropriate at any time for the sterlingafea&apos;S current balance of payments with the rest of the world.(c) Within these policies, a plan of sound development of a nature which will improve the balance of payments of all sterling area countries and strengthen their competitive power.The Nature of the Approach4. After the Commonwealth Economic Conference, discussions would be opened with the United States and leading Western European Countries, in orderto secure agreement On a course of action, of which the following would be themain elements:  (a) The convertibility of sterling and the currencies of leading european countries.(b) Adequate financial support for convertibility, to be provided mainly, thoughriot necessarily exclusively, through the International Monetary Fund(I.M.F.).(c) A concerted long-term policy of removing quantitative restrictions imposedfor balarice-Of-payments purposes, and of the progressive removal of discrimination as the world dollar problem is solved.(d) Modification of I.M.F. and the General Agreement on Tariff arid Trade(G.A.T.T.), including, in particular, a revision of the &quot; no-new-preference &quot; rule in G.A.T.T.(e) Adoption of &quot; good creditor &quot; policies by the United States.5. The course of action would have to be agreed on each of those elementsfirst within the Commonwealth and then with United States and leading Euro-pean countries, although of course the detailed application would take varyingperiods to negotiate internationally. It would be necessary to make clear duringthe discussions the import policies which we and other sterling area countriesintended to follow in the intervening period between- the convertibility operation and the time when the new international trade system envisaged in paragraph 4 (c)was in full working order.6.   The proposals are open to modification after discussion, but whatevermodifications are made, the final judgment must always remain in our own hands,arid when We come to riiake it we must be clear that the conditions are satisfactory.43145 B 2
No commitment is implied in the proposals on the timing of the operation for the convertibility of sterling. The decision on this would be taken in the light of thecircumstances ruling at the time and the progress made under each of the elements in the proposals.Detailed Considerations7. Convertibility. The decisive action is that on sterling, for sterling is theonly true international non-dollar currency. Consequently the timing and opera-tional arrangements would be kept in United Kingdom hands (subject to para-graphs 10 and 11 below). There would be provision for simultaneous action byleading European countries. In our case the convertibility would apply only tonewly-acquired sterling in non-resident hands, and arrangements would have tobe made to prevent accumulations of sterling held by a limited number of non-sterling countries from being used in a manner which would endanger the operation.8. The convertibility, being for non-residents only, would provide no newfacilities for other sterling area countries. The existing sterling area practices-common exchange control policy nad consultation on import policy, &amp;c. would continue as at present.9. Flexible Rate. The objective of policy would be to keep the rate stable,and the intention would be to keep fluctuations within reasonable margins in orderto protect the trade and the economies of the whole sterling area from the dangersand inconveniences of instability. But there would be no intention of establishing a range of a fixed amount above or below the present parity within which the dollar-sterling rate would be held in all circumstances. The major trends in the sterling area&apos;s relationship with the rest of the world would have to be reflected in the movements of the rate, and countered by appropriate policies.10. The day-to-day management of the sterling-dollar rate would rest withthe United Kingdom, but general rate policy would be explained to Common-wealth Finance Ministers before the operation, and they would be kept informedso that they could, if necessary, ask for discussion.11. If any sterling area Government, before deciding whether to continueits present exchange rate with sterling or to fix a new rate, wished to let its currencyfloat against sterling until it found the proper level, there would be no objectionto this as a purely temporary measure.12. Financial Support. The essentials are that it should be sufficient, thatthere should be assured access to it, and that, if voted by Congress, it should not involve the United Kingdom and the sterling area-in any new obligations otherthan those involved in the proposals.13. Each country becoming convertible would make its own arrangements todraw funds through I.M.F. This would mean asking the United States to putmore funds at I.M.F.&apos;s disposal. Only if I.M.F. funds could not be increasedsufficiently would the United Kingdom seek credits bilaterally with other north american institutions (e.g., the Federal Reserve Bank or the United States stabilisation-tion Fund the former of which would avoid the need for Congressional action).No conditions inconsistent with the essentials set out in the previous paragraph should be accepted.14. Quantitative Restrictions and Discrimination. The procedure would beto establish agreement with the Commonwealth on:  (a) Objectives of long-term policy to be agreed with the Americans and leadingEuropeans and to be announced as part of any international agreement which was reached on the whole operation.(b) Operating policies in the intervening period after the convertibility opera-tion and before the new international system was in full working order.15. The essentials of the long-term policy referred to in paragraph 14 (a)would be:  (a) Determined international action-(i) to remove quantitative restrictions; and &apos;..(ii) to assure the progressive removal of discrimination in step withthe progressive solution of the world dollar problem.
(b) Provision that the speed of removal of restrictions would not necessarily be the same for all sterling area countries.(c) Recognition that the solution of balance-of-payments problems may require action both by creditors and by debtors, and that the trade rules should be framed accordingly. This would provide a process by whichpressure could be exerted on the United States to adopt &quot; goodcreditor&quot; policies as part of the plan to abolish restrictions anddiscrimination.(d) Recognition of the need for constructive remedies rather than a legalisticapproach.16. When the long-term policy was in full operation the trade rules wouldprovide that countries retaining quantitative restrictions would have to justify them on the special grounds (such as economic development, &amp;c.) specifically providedfor in G.A.T.T., and would be able otherwise to apply restrictions only under ageneral emergency clause. This clause would cover both emergencies for individual countries arising from their own balance-of-payments difficulties and world-wideemergencies arising from general unbalance (e.g., the world dollar problem).Countries invoking this clause would be obliged to justify their action immediatelyafterwards to a joint committee of I.M.F. and G.A.T.T. The committee would examine the situation and seek remedies both in the financial and trade field(national and international) which would enable the restrictions to be removed as quickly as possible.17. The agreement on long-term policy would be an integral part of thescheme. There would be an intervening period before the proposed I.M.F./G.A.T.T. joint committee began to formulate new rules in detail, for there mustbe experience of the working of convertibility at flexible rates before precise long-term trade rules can be worked out. Moreover, the United Kingdom and other sterling countries would need to keep their hands as free as possible in that time,in order to take whatever action might be best to limit the impact of convertibility.18. In this intervening period, the United Kingdom and other sterling area countries would adopt import policies which moved towards the long-term &quot;objec-tives while reducing to a minimum any additional strain on the sterling area&apos;balance of payments with the rest of the world, thus safeguarding our interests inthe critical early stage of convertibility.19. The United Kingdom import policy in this intervening period wouldbe:-(a) No change in the present &quot; open door &quot; policy towards imports from other sterling area countries.(b) Subject to (a), an extension of the present policy of buying raw materials and staple foods on the most favourable commercial terms: this wouldmean working towards world open general licences in some suitable cases, and to non-sterling global quotas in others.(c) Some liberalisation of imports from Europe (from the present 45 per cenl.of total trade to 60-75 per cent.) in order to hold the position of our exports.20. This policy would not involve any significant additional strain on theUnited Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments with the non-sterling world.21/ Similar considerations do not apply in the case of some of the other sterling area countries, because, unlike the United Kingdom, they apply then-import restrictions alike for all non-dollar goods, including imports from the UnitedKingdom. In these circumstances, the United Kingdom must press them (inaccordance with paragraph 18 above):  (a) to observe strict economy in imports from the dollar area; and(b) to relax their restrictions on non-dollar goods as quickly as their balanceof payments and reserves permit.22. As regards (a) these countries want greater freedom to import dollar goods.The cheapest concession, and the one which would give them most satisfaction,would be to agree that they should have greater freedom to import capital goods for
their development programmes and staple food (e.g., rice) from the dollar area. the concession on capital goods would, however, be politically difficult while the UnitedKingdom engineering industry is heavily engaged on defence, and any concession would of course weaken the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments with the rest ofthe world. If some concession had to be made under this head as a resultof the Commonwealth Conference, it should be linked with progress madeunder (b). What we want under (b) is that when other Commonwealth countries are ready to remove their restrictions, they should consult the United Kingdom,so that hard-hit United Kingdom exporters have a chance to get back some of theirlost business. Without this we should have to face serious political difficulties here.23. Preference. Despite the disappointing reception of our proposals by commonwealth Officials, we must press them on the Prime Ministers. As quantita-tive restrictions are reduced, tariffs and preferences become more important, and we ought not to have to impose duties against the Commonwealth whenever we want to raise duties against the foreigner. Nor should other Commonwealth countries,including the Colonies, be compelled to raise duties against us whenever they wishto raise duties against foreign, e.g., Japanese, competition.24. If we fail with the Commonwealth on our original proposals, we must fallback on a limited solution. The essential minimum is to enable the United kingdom to regain freedom to move tariffs at present inhibited by the conflict between theG.A.T.T. no-new-preference rule and the Ottawa duty-free commitment.25. &quot;Good Creditor&quot; Policies by the United States. It is hoped that this advance to convertibility and the removal of import restrictions would strengthen the forces in the United States which are pressing for a more liberal commercial policy, and that it would be possible within this general context to obtain under -takings of effective action, e.g., on tariffs, &quot; Buy American &quot; legislation, shipping,commodity policy, &amp;c.26. Modification of I.M.F. and G.A.T.T, The essential elements in thiswould be:  (a) A joint committee of I.M.F. and G.A.T.T., meeting at pre-arrangedintervals as a forum for discussion of the whole complex of finance,trade and associated problems.(b) The new rules for import restrictions.(c) A revision of the &quot;no-new-preference &quot; rule.(d) Adaptation of I.M.F. practices to conform with the new exchange situation,and to provide adequate financial support for the countries undertakingconvertibility and greater short-term credit facilities generally.27. The effect of the proposals as a whole would be to bring forward I.M.F.into a central position in the world&apos;s financial arrangements, to modify G.A.T.T.,and in the proposed I.M.F.-G.A.T.T. joint committee to establish a forum in whichoperating officials from ten or twelve important countries (four of which wouldprobably be Commonwealth) could work out effectively the practical course for creating the trading and payments conditions which are necessary to stabilise and strengthen the world economy.31st October, 1952.
