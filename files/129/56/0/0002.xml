secret. (52) 352 COPY NO.    //21st OCTOBER, 1952.CABINETTRANSPORT bill memorandum by the Secretary of State forCo-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power.At a further meeting yesterday, the Transport Policy Committeeresumed their consideration of proposals for substantial amendments to theTransport Bill on the basis that part two of the transport levy (i. e. the partdesigned to compensate for future transfers of traffic from rail to road) would be dropped.   Three possible courses of action which might flow from droppingpart two of the levy were set out in paragraph 2 of my memorandum to theCabinet on 20th October (C. (52) 346).   Of these, the third, set out in paragraph 2(c)to leave the Road Haulage Executive&apos;s undertaking with the British transport commission, to drop both parts of the levy and to remove the twenty-five-mile limit immediately - which the Committee had tended to favour at their previous meeting last week, was now seen, on further examination, to entail gravedisadvantages.   In particular:-(a) insufficient provision is made for enabling expropriatedlong-distance road hauliers to come back into the business,and we thus fail properly to fulfil one of our election pledges;(b) by removing the twenty-five-mile limit at once we go too fasthaving undertaken no more than that it should be progressivelyremoved;(c) we should be adopting a short-term expedient without any clearidea of a long-term plan for transport and without providing any form of co-ordination between road and rail.2. The majority opinion of the Committee has therefore reverted tosupport of the compromise solution propounded by theCabinet on 7th October(C0C.(52) 84th Conclusions, Minute 2).   Under this the Bill would be amended so as to include (i) provision for ensuring greater flexibility in railway charges,subject to suitable safeguards;  and (ii) provision that the second part of theproposed levy on road haulage should be brought into operation only if thefinan ial situation of the railways justified it and affirmative resolutionsapproving its introduction had been passed by both Houses of Parliament.(There are, indeed, members of the Committee who still think that the fullscheme of the Transport Bill, as drafted, including both parts of ^he levy, isthe right course in the national interest, but they are prepared to accept thcompromise set out above. )  In reverting to the compromise solution, those members who accept it recognise that agreement to increased freedom ofcharging by the railways will be difficult to secure from trade and industry,whose representatives have made their agreement conditional on part  two
of the levy bring dropped altogether. But this attitude may be, to some extent,a matter of bargaining:  it is possible that they would be satisfied, given*   vfilispension of part two of t e levy, and the certainty that it could not bebrought into effect without Parliamentary approval.   Under the Bill as it stands, no payment of part two weald become due for between two and threeyears.   Even greater re-assurance might be given to trade and industry by providing that no affirmative resolution could be brought in before threeyears from the Bill&apos;s becoming law.   The Government would then be able to argue, very reasonably, that they were giving time for the new arrangements towork themselves out, and for their effects to be felt before any question could arise of bringing the levy into play as a balancing factor between road and rail.3. It is only right to add that a minority of t e Committee stronglyhold the view that the course proposed in paragraph 2(c) of C. (52) 346 isthe right one.   They think that under it the railways would be given the fullest possible chance;  that the short-distance hauliers would bne relieved of theirpresent burdens;  that all the difficulties involved in the levy would be avoided;  that we should secure the goodwill of trade and industry;  thatthe hostility of the trade unions would be largely mollified;  and that theresult would be difficult for a Socialist Government to reverse.4. Either course - the compromise or that proposed in paragraph 2(c)of C. (52) 346 - assumes the possibility of legislating now so as to give therailways greater freedom of charging.   But the view has been put forward that such a fundamental alteration - and the legislation to be altered goesback for more than a hundred years - should not be made without assurancein advance of the support of trade and industry and of the British transport commission and other users and providers of transport.   According to thisview, a decision about railway charges should be deferred until the matter has been subjected to wider investigation.5, At their meeting on 22nd October therefore theCabinet will be(a) to decide between the compromise solution which theypropounded on 7th October and the proposals set outin paragraph 2(c) of C. (52) 346;(b) whatever their decision under (a) to consider whether thequestion of railway charges should not be further examined.The necessary amendments can be drafted only just in time for a revised draft Bill to be submitted to theCabinet before presentation to parliament at the beginning of the new Session.asked -Great George Street, S.W.1.21st OCTOBER, 1952.
