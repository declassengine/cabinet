(THIS DOCUMENT IS-THE PROPERTY OF HER-BRITANNIC MA-JESTY&apos;S GOV-ERNMENT)-confidential.(52) 3884th NOVEMBER, 1952.CABINETSUDANMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.On 22nd October I told the House of Commons that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had informed the Acting Governor-General of the Sudan that they approved the draft Statute designed to give the Sudan self-government*   I addedthat we should wish to give consideration to any suggested amendments whichthe Egyptian Government might wish to make to the draft Statute,   We have now received the Egyptian suggestions, and they raise a number of issues, principallyin relation to the discretionary powers of the Governor-General.   These issueswill obviously require detailed study here, and it may be a little time before wecan let the Egyptian Government know our views.2. One issue raised by the Egyptian note concerns the future choice of the sudanese.   The Egyptians propose that the Sudanese choice should be limited toa decision either -(a) to link up the Sudan with Egypt; or(b) to choose complete independence from the United Kingdom, Egyptor any other country.This wording may be intended to exclude the possibility that the Sudan should eventually apply for membership of the British Commonwealth,   We shall haveto give further thought to this, since there is a section of Sudanese opinion whichfavours joining the Commonwealth on self-determination.   In this connection Ihave received a letter from a Mr. Omar, the Secretary of the Sudan Party,in which he explains that his Party believes that the Sudan should join theBritish Commonwealth of Nations,3, My information is that Mr. Omar&apos;s Party in the Sudan is not a verylarge or influential one, although he claims that its views are in accordancewith the wishes of the majority of the sudanese,   I presume that if the Sudanesewere to apply eventually for membership of the Commonwealth, it would benecessary first to consult all the other independent members of the Commonwealthsome of whom might have decided views on the subject.   It may be thought wise to take informal soundings fairly soon.   Meanwhile we cannot, I suppose, enterinto any commitment.4. I attach a draft reply to Mr, Omar which might be sent on my behalf.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,4th November, 1952.fCOPY NO.
DRAFT LETTER TO MOHAMMED AHMED OMARI am directed by Her Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to reply to your letter of 23rd October, in which you setout at length for me the views of the Sudan Party.   Mr. Eden regrets that theshortness of notice and pressure of his engagements made it impossible for him to see you himself, but he is glad that you had the opportunity of explainingyour views orally to Lord Reading, who has informed Mr. Eden of them.He is, of course, keenly interested in having the views of all sections of opinion in the Sudan.I am to thank you for your statement of your belief that the present administration in the Sudan has striven to prevent a clash between the conflicting elements in the country, and of your faith that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will desire to aid the Sudan and the Sudanese in their futured development.   It is indeed Mr. Eden&apos;s intention to assist in whatever way seemsconducive to the best interests of the Sudan, and it is his earnest desire that thehappy relationship between our two peoples, which has developed over the pastfifty years, shall continue for long into the future.   It is not possible for her majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom at this time to express any opinion about the form which that relationship should take.   The purpose of thenew Self-Government Statute is to provide the sudanese people with representative institutions through which they will themselves be able toexpress at an early date their opinions on the future status of the Sudan.   when that time comes, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will have full regard to the freelyexpressed will of the Sudanese people in framing their policy.
