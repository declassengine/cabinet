DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT!secret.(52) 368   . COPY NO.    j28TH OCTOBER, 1952CABINETTHE TRANSPORT bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for Co-ordinationof Transport, Fuel and power the Transport Policy Committee have reviewed the draft transport bill published on 1st July last in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion of22nd October (C. C. (52) 88th Conclusions, Minute 3).    As a result, theCommittee have had prexsared the attached revised draft Bill.     This differs from the draft of 1st July mainly by providing for the suspension of part twq&apos;of the transport levy and by conceding greater flexibility in railway charges.It also incorporates a number of lesser amendments which the Committee have thought it right to accept.The Transport Levy (Clauses 10 - 14)2. As now drafted, the Bill provides that part two of the levy (to compensate the railways for future losses of net revenue out of all futurechanges of traffic from rail to road) shall not come into effect before31st December, 1956 at the earliest, and only then, or later, if approved by affirmative resolutions passed by both Houses of Parliament.    It has been.!necessary to retain (in clause 13) the machinery for assessing part two of the levy.    If this were not retained, suspension would be almost meaningless since,after a few years, there would be no basis on which to assess the amounts due.This part of the Bill has been prepared in this form for convenience.    If th^decision of the Cabinet is that part two of the levy should be abandonedaltogether, the necessary amendments can be readily made, mainly by simpledeletion.Railway Charges (Clauses 20 - 25)3. These clauses, in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s direction, addprovisions for ensuring greater flexibility in railway charges, subject to suitable safeguards.      They represent broadly a provisional agreement reached at one stage between the British Transport Commission and acommittee representative of trade and industry, including the Federation ofBritish Industries, the National Union of Manufacturers and the Associationof British Chambers of Commerce.    The last-named body, however, dissented.Greater Flexibility in Charging.     Compared with the correspondingclauses (19 - 24) of the draft Bill of 1st July, the relative clauses of the new draft gave extra latitude in charging as follows:- .(a)  charges for the carriage of goods by inland waterways are notto be determined by the charges schemes (Clause 20(1));  the Commission willbe free, as in the case of carriage of goods by road throughout, to charge whatthey like and will be in the same position as their competitors;
(b) a charges scheme must require the Commission to publish themaximum charges fixed under the scheme and it may not oblige the Commissionto publish any other charges (clause 20(2));(c) various restrictive enactments including those relating to equality of charges, undue preference and agreed charges, are not to apply to chargesdealt with in charges schemes confirmed after the Bill becomes law(clause 21),5.       Safeguards (Clause 22).     This provides a measure of protection against unreasonable or unfair charges for traders and others whose goodscannot reasonably be carried except by rail.   They may complain to theTransport Tribunal who, if satisfied that a case has been made out, maymake such order as they think fit on the Commission.6. Clause 23 reproduces the protection of the competitors of theCommission which was embodied in clause 20 of the draft of 1st July.Under the clause competitors have a right to complain to the transport tribunal if the Commission charge uneconomic rates with a view to eliminatingcompetition for the carriage of merchandise.   The clause also extends theprotection already given to statutory harbour authorities in respect of railways rates so as to include charges for the provision of port facilities.7. The &quot;headroom&quot; Clause   This is intended to enable the Commissionto increase their charges in order to meet sudden increases in costs which,if not quickly met, will seriously affect their financial position.   It appearsas clause 24 of the new draft which, however, differs from the correspondingclause (clause 22) of the draft of 1st July.   In its original form the clausewould have presented difficulties because, as it is now proposed, a verylarge number of the Commission^ charges would be neither known nor fixed.It is now therefore provided that the Commission may put before theTransport Tribunal proposals for so increasing their charges for all or anyof the services covered by different charges schemes as to produce up toa 10% increase in revenue; and to apply to the Tribunal for interim authority(pending the submission of a modified charges scheme) to make the necessaryincreases in maxima.Other Amendments8.        A number of other amendments have been made in the Bill.   Thechief of these are as follows,9. Road Haulage Interests of the British Transport Commission (Clause 4).The draft of 1st July (clause 4) enabled the Commission to retain interestsin road transport broadly equivalent to the interests immediately beforenationalisation of the former railway and canal companies.   The commission have suggested that the road haulage interests they are to retain should be considerably increased.   The Committee have not thought it right to agree,particularly as one of the Commission^ suggestions, if accepted, would have left them with a large measure of monopoly of the haulage of specially heavy and difficult loads.   It did, however, seem reasonable to go some way towards meeting the Commission;   and to save much detailed work and possibleargument with the Commission, this increase has been put at the arbitrary,but generous, figure of 20%.   That is why proviso (i) to clause 4(2) limits theCommission^ retention of road haulage interests to &quot;six-fifths of the totalunladen weight of the motor vehicles&quot; taken over on nationalisation.
Oillu.   Removal of the 25-mile Limit.    The draft of 1st July (clause 7) providedthat the 25-mile limit should be lifted on a day to be appointed by the minister when he considered the sale of transport units to have gone as far aspracticable.   Clause 7 of the new draft fixes a date for lifting the limit -31st December, 1954.    In deciding to recommend this change the Committeehad co strike a balance of advantages.   On the one hand, so long as the dateremained indefinite, short-distance hauliers would feel that the Governmentspledge to them was not being implemented;   on the other the fixing of a datemight tempt purchasers to hold off.   The Committee felt that there werepractical and political advantages in fixing a date, provided sufficient time were given for working out the general lines cf a disposal scheme, forselling as many transport units as possible, and for giving purchasers oftransport units a definite and known time in which to establish themselves in long-distance business - a prospect which might indeed encourage earlypurchase.   A fixed date should also serve to stimulate the Commission to speed in making up and selling transport units.   Taking all these factors intoaccount, the date now in the Bill seems to be the appropriate one.   Itshould be realised that fixing the date will have the effect, first that thelimit may have to be maintained after the sale of transport units has cometo an end, and secondly that, before the limit is lifted, the Commission mayhave to proceed to selling the balance of their road haulage assets as chattels.11,        Disturbance Loss to the Commission    The objects of part one of the levy are set out in clause 12.   They are to compensate the Commission (a) for capital losses arising on the sale of the Road Haulage Executive&apos;s assets,and (b) for losses due to disturbance during the transitional period and whilethe sale is going on.   In the draft of 1st July the disturbance loss was to be assessed by the Minister of Transport.   In the attached draft the disturbance losshas been fixed, under clause 12(l)(b) at  1 million.   This is an arbitrary sumbut it has the virtue of being precise, of saving much argument, of preventingexcessive claims by the Commission and of relieving the Minister of a difficultduty.12.       Assessing Railway Losses due to Transfer of Traffic     Under the draftof 1st July the duty of assessing (for the purposes of part two of the levy) railwaylosses due to transfer of traffic was placed on the Transport Tribunal, but theMinister was empowered to alter the amount fixed by the Tribunal,   In clause 13of the attached draft the Minister no longer has this power and the fixing of theamount is left entirely to the Tribunal,   In making this change, the Committee havebeen impressed by the criticism of the provision, as previously drafted, thatit was doubtful whether the Minister, having before him the same evidence as theTribunal had had, could come to a different conclusion.   This changealso relieves the Minister of an onerous duty.13,       Relations between the Commission and the Minister of Transport    Thedraft of 1st July, in clause 23(3), made it part of the duties of the Chairman of theCommission to keep the Minister informed on the Commissioh&apos;s activities.   Theobject of this provision was to establish a proper statutory relationship inthis matter between the Commission and the Minister,   On reflection, however,the Committee think that the provision - which has no parallel in the other nationalised industries - is better omitted.Conclusion14. I ask my colleagues:-(a)   to decide whether part two of the levy on road transport should be abandoned altogether, or whether it should be suspended in themanner provided for in clause 14 of the attached draft Bill;
(b) to approve the provisions for ensuring greater flexibility in railway charges, subject to safeguards, contained in clauses20=25 of the attached draft Bill;(c) subject to their decisions under (a) and (b), to approve theattached draft Bill for introduction to Parliament at the beginningof the new Session,Great George Street, S.W.1,28th October, 1952..
