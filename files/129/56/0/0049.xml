Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1952SECRETC. (52) 39910th November, 1952CABINETTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT, 1947Amendment of Financial ProvisionsMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on the transitional arrangements the Chancellor and I wish to draw attention in particular to paragraphs 44-48of the White Paper, which set out the arrangements proposed for changing over from the old system to the new. We are in agreement that there can be no questionof repaying development charge as such, anymore than there is of making changesin taxation retrospective. Where an adjustment has to be made it must take theform of a payment against the claim on the  300 million, and it is with the holders of claims that we must in the first instance deal.2.   The circumstances where some adjustment is proposed are as follows:  (1) Where the land has been acquired by a public authority at existing use value.(2) Where development of the land has been prevented by the refusal orrevocation of planning permission.In these cases payment of the claim (or appropriate part)represents no more than the completion of an uncompleted trans-action.  Public authorities who escape paying development charge on land which they have bought at existing use value will be madeto contribute towards the cost of paying the relevant claims..(3) Where the land has been developed and development charge paid, payment will be made on the claim up to the amount of the charge which was paid.Notwithstanding the decision not to repay development chargeas such, payment of the claim is appropriate in these cases becausethe right to claim was the counterpart of the liability to charge.If the charge is to be retained by the Exchequer the claim mustbe met up to the extent of the charge.  Where the claim is heldby the developer who paid the charge the whole payment will goto him.   But there will be many cases where the developer hasbought the land since the Acts came into force leaving the claimwith the vendor.  Here it is proposed to underpay the holder ofthe claim to the extent that he has already realised the development value of his land in selling, and to divert the balance to thedeveloper who paid the charge.  This diversion of the balance isex gratia but since the Government is declining in these cases topay the full claim to the holder or to repay development chargeas such, this seems the only reasonable course.(4) Where the land has changed hands since the Acts came into force, the vendor keeping the claim but no development has taken place, it isproposed to pay the vendor&apos;s claim on the same basis as in (3) that is.to pay the unrealised portion of the 1947 development value.Copy No. 7 g
3. This last case is more debatable than the other three. The need for adjustment arises from the fact that the price at which the land changed hands wasin many cases depressed by the purchaser^ liability to charge and the vendor&apos;s rightto claim on the  300 million fund. Now, if the land is developed the purchaser willescape charge and ordinarily no payment would be made in respect of the claim.&quot; Logically what is needed is simply an adjustment between the parties to the originaltransaction: but the State&apos;s credit is involved to the extent that the purchase pricewas affected by the promise of payment from the  300 million fund. To leave the vendor to recover as best he could from the purchaser would be unfair to thosepublic-spirited owners of land who at the prompting of the Government sold their land at or near existing use value. It is therefore proposed in these cases to make up to the vendor so much of the 1947 development value as was not included inthe purchase price.4. The further question arises whether any attempt should be made to recover the sum paid from the purchaser if the land is developed. In equity thereis every reason why he should pay, but the difficulty of tracing the cases and ofsecuring payment long after the development has taken place, and it may be afterthe property has changed hands, would be very great. I believe that to attemptto recover in these cases would cause a great deal of confusion, and would reallybe impracticable. If this is agreed the passage in square brackets in paragraph 47of the draft White Paper should be deleted.5.   Any estimate of the cost of these arrangements can only be conjectural.The amount to be paid out in respect of land acquired by public authorities isestimated at  21 \ million, part of which would be recoverable from the authorities.Payment in respect of land which has already been developed and charge paid,excluding development by public authorities, are estimated at  6 million.Payments in respect of land which has changed hands without the claim, but has not already been developed (paragraphs 3 and 4 above), might amount to asmuch as  5 million, but part of this would have to be paid anyway as and whenpermission for development was refused.No estimate can be made of the payments which will have to be made in caseswhere permission to develop has been refused or revoked. As there have been agood many refusals to allow building on farm land and in green belts, this may prove the largest item.6. The Bill which I seek authority to introduce is designed simply to &quot; hold the fort &quot; until the main legislation can be passed next Session. Clause 1 abolishesdevelopment charge in respect of all schemes of development commenced after thedate of introduction, but leaves developers with the commitments which they havealready shouldered. Clause 2 removes the requirement to pay out the  300 millionfund and empowers the Central Land Board to veto assignments of claims on thefund (this is needed to prevent the cost of the adjustments proposed in paragraph 2of this Paper being increased by artificial assignments). Clause 3 is designed toprevent some of the more serious anomalies to which the abolition of development charge would otherwise give rise.7. The Committee on Development Charges and Compensation have to-daydiscussed the draft White Paper. The amendments agreed have been incorporated in the text printed herewith. Points requiring further discussion are outstandingon paragraphs 27, 36-37, 39 and 47.H. M.Ministry of Housing, S.W. J,10th November, 1952.
DRAFT WHITE PAPERTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING ACT, 1947TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (SCOTLAND) ACT, 1947AMENDMENT OF FINANCIAL PROVISIONSPart I. introduction. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have had under review the financial provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, and the Town and country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1947.2. These provisions do not differ very greatly from the proposals contained in tne White Paper on the Control of Land Use (Cmd. 6537)which was laid before Parliament by the Coalition Government in 1944.But in operation they have attracted a great deal of criticism from many different quarters; from local authorities, from representatives of industryand commerce, from professional bodies, from property owners, large and small, and from many private people anxious to build themselves a houseor to engage in some other enterprise. It is generally agreed that theexperience of four years has revealed serious practical difficulties in the;working of the financial provisions.3. Exercise of control over land use affects land values by altering theprospects of profitable development. Refusal of permission to develop landmeans loss for the owner; the grant of permission means gain. The 1947Acts were an attempt to settle the finance of planning, and to enable the planning authorities to control the use of land without looking over theirshoulders at the posible cost of every decision. Before the war paymentof compensation for loss due to planning restrictions was a matter for thelocal authorities, who in theory could recover some part of the increasedvalue accruing elsewhere (betterment). In practice they failed to recoverbetterment, and they were unable, particularly during the period of buildingboom when development values were high, to face the expenditure entailed by a full exercise of their power to restrict undesirable development. Howineffective the control was may be seen to take only one example in someof the outer suburbs of London, stretching over first-class market gardenland and irreplacable gravel deposits.4. This problem was analysed in the Report of the Uthwatt Committeepublished in 1942 (Cmd. 6386), and summarised in the White Paper of 1944.The solution adopted by the 1947 Acts was to pool the development values ofall land by transferring them to the State, and to make developers pay a development charge, the charge being in effect the cost of buying back fromthe State the development value in respect of the development permitted. Thesystem has three main features (i) no development may be carried out without planning permission and,subject to certain exceptions, when permission is granted a develop-ment charge must be paid on the increase in the value of the landdue to the grant of permission;(ii) payment is to be made, by 1953, out of a  300 million fund to anyone who can show that his interest in land was materially depreciated in value by the Act, and no compensation is payable except in special cases when planning permission is refused;(iii) the price at which land is bought by compulsory purchase is its value for its existing use: in other words, development value is excluded.5. Her Majesty&apos;s Government intend to maintain the full control of land use provided for in the Acts. It is even more necessary now than ever beforeto prevent building over good agricultural land or over land containing valuablemineral deposits; to restrain the outward sprawl of the great towns; to improveliving conditions and industrial efficiency; to preserve the countryside and coastline from further disfigurement and destruction. The question which theGovernment have had to consider is whether it is possible, while maintainingthese powers unimpaired, so to adjust the financial provisions as to reduce orget rid of the difficulties which have arisen in practice; and to do this while maintaining a limit on the cost to public funds and without bearing too hardlyon private individuals.6. The conclusion to which Her Majesty&apos;s Government have come is thatamendment which will fulfil the essential purposes of the Acts of 1947, but which will get rid of the worst difficulties in the financial provisions, ispossible. Their proposals, in broad outline, are set out in Part III below.In order that these may be better understood, the difficulties in the existing system are described in Part II. ,* Development is very widely defined. It includes any building, engineering or miningoperations and any material change in the use of buildings or land.
Part II. The Practical Difficulties of the Existing Financial Provisions7. It should be stated, at the outset, that the difficulties which have arisen are not due to defects of administration. The Central Land Board,aided by the Valuation Office, have done everything possible within theprovisions of the Acts to make them work smoothly, to temper their impactin hard cases, and to help people to understand the underlying principles.The Board and their advisers have had a most difficult task, and the Govern-ment wish to place on record their appreciation of the work of all concerned.8. The difficulties may best be described by reference to the main features of the 1947 system-(i) The  300 million fund9. At one time it was suggested that the  300 million fund might be quite insufficient to meet claims in respect of depreciation in land values.Most of the claims made to the Central Land Board have, however, nowbeen assessed; and it appears that the total will be of the order of  350million. Some claimants have been promised preferential treatment; their claims are unlikely to exceed  100 million. Once these have been met, thefund would enable the remainder to be paid at something like 16s. in the  .10. Under the Acts as they stand payments from the fund are due to bemade before 1st July, 1953. To make all these payments in the next fewmonths would have a considerable inflationary effect. Moreover, payment would benefit many owners who have little or no case for payment. Someof those who hold claims have not suffered any loss as a result of the Actsbecause they have already recovered the development value of the land byselling at a high price, or because they do not want either to sell or todevelop the land; they may even have bought it for the express purpose of preventing its development. In other cases the development value could onlybe realised at the expense of neighbours or of the community (e.g., by extend-ing a building, or changing its use, to the detriment of neighbouring properties,or by developing in such a way as to throw an unreasonable burden on public services). It would be reasonable to prevent this sort of development with-out any payment of compensation at all, as indeed was done under the 1932Acts. But perhaps the main difficulty in paying out all at once is that if that is done it would be exceedingly difficult for any future Government ever to make radical changes in the financial provisions, however badly they were working. For all the holders of claims on the fund would have been com-pensated for loss of development value-those who will be&apos; allowed to develop their land as well as those who will not.(ii) Purchase at existing use value ,11. All transactions in land should, on the theory of the Acts, takeplace at or around existing use value. But, except where compulsory powers are available, few owners will sell land for development at no more thanit is worth for its existing use; naturally enough, since a sale on that basiswill not recompense them for the disturbance and expense involved. Inthese circumstances most owners feel that they would do better to keep their land : and one result of the Acts has been that little land is being offered for development.i12. Where, however, the developer pays more than existing use value, asthe private developer commonly must, the effect is to increase his outlay onthe land above what it would have been had the Acts not been passed, sincedevelopment charge has also to be paid and is in effect part of the purchase price. To that extent the Acts have increased the cost of private development.The Central Land Board have certain powers of compulsory purchase whichthey Can use to ensure that land changes hands on the basis of value for existing use; and on occasion they have, when approached by a prospectivedeveloper, acquired compulsorily on his behalf land which the owner wasoffering for sale at a price which was unreasonable in view of the developer&apos;sliability to pay development charge. But intervention of this kind in transaction-transactions between individuals is invidious and. at-&apos; best haphazard; whilethe existence of the power of compulsory purchase at. existing use valuecontributes to the reluctance of owners to offer land for development at all.13. To the extent, therefore, that the existing use value basis is effectiveit has tended to keep land off the market; and to the extent that it has beenignored the cost of development has risen. Public authorities with their powers of compulsory purchase can, it is true, buy the land they need at existing use value, and in recent years they have been responsible for a largeproportion of the building which has been done.   But private developers,, whose activities the Government desire to encourage, have been severelyhampered through being unable to obtain land for development at prices which take sufficient account of their liability to development charge.
(iii) Development charge14. Development charge was intended to secure for the communityincreases in the Value of land due to planning decisions or public improve-ments, so that they could be set against the cost of paying compensation; andat the same time to hold the scales evenly between those who were allowedto develop their land and those who were not. Making every allowance forthe teething troubles of a new system, four years&apos; experience of the workingof the system has shown that few people really grasp the underlying theory,and that there is, in any event, a wide gap between theory and practice.15. In theory the man who pays development charge is merely buyingfrom the community the development value which he would otherwise havehad to buy from the owner of the land. But this separation of development value from the land is too difficult for most people to grasp: to them the potentialities of a site are inherent in it. Consequently, they consider it reasonable to pay the owner a high price for a good site and, having paid it,regard the Central Land Board not as an owner with something to sell, butas a tax collector whose demands are a burden on their enterprise. When aman buys land the price he pays depends on his own bargaining power andthe owner&apos;s willingness to sell. If he does not like the price asked he cango elsewhere. But there is no escaping development charge; and the man who does not have to buy but wishes to develop his own land feels a specialgrievance.16. The public dislike of development charge has been increased by thefact that the Government has required settlement in cash and in full whereaspayment on the claims on the  300 million fund was deferred. For thosedevelopers who hold claims on the fund the impact of the charge has beenreduced since the announcement that the Central Land Board would acceptthe claims as security for the charge up to 80 per cent, of their agreed value.But this easement does not by any means apply to all developers and is inany case temporary: setting-off the charge against the claims in this way willnot be possible when the fund has been distributed and the money has been spent or locked up in some investment. As time passes and the prospects of development concentrate and mature in particular places, the gap which inmany cases already exists between the amount of the claim and the amountof the development charge will grow wider. The theory on which the charge is founded will seem even more elusive, and in practice the collection ofdevelopment charge will have to be made in the face of increasing publicresistance.17. The real effect of development charge on the cost of developmentvaries. As already explained, land for development has not, generally speak-ing, changed hands at or near its value for its existing use; and to the extent that it does not do so the charge represents a burden on the development.A few landowners have sold on the existing use value basis, but in most cases the price paid has included a part, sometimes even the whole, of thedevelopment value; and in many of these cases the owner has retained theclaim on the  300 million fund. To some extent conditions during the past few years have been exceptional, because the substantial scarcity valueattaching to a building licence has made developers willing to pay a high price for land. But even when this special factor is removed the buyer will still have to pay a premium above existing use value sufficient to persuade theowner to sell, and development charge at 100 per cent, must entail a permanentaddition to the cost of development. The real addition may not be verygreat, but with the cost of developing as high as it is to-day any addition is amatter for concern; and sometimes the extra burden seems to the developerprohibitive. .,18. Another objection to development charge is that its basis is uncertain. Since it is assessed on the difference between the value ofthe land without permission to develop and its value for the developmentpermitted, the amount of the charge is inevitably a matter of judgment and valuation and therefore for negotiation, in the same way as the price of landis a matter for negotiation. In some cases quite small adjustments in the twovalues during the process of such negotiation will have a very large effect onthe amount of development charge finally assessed. This is inherent in thenature of the charge, but the effect is to destroy confidence in its validity.Those who view development charge as a tax on development and they arein the great majority look for some definite relation between the amountassessed and the cost of the land or of the development; and their failure to find any makes them very critical of the method of assessment.Possible Modifications19, Over the past few years many suggestions have been made for the modification of the Acts in order to provide some incentive to owners to;sell land for development or to develop their own land and to reduce thedifficulties associated with development charge.   The Government have
Paragraph 21, line 9After &quot; to a negligible amount&quot; insert:&quot; About 70 per cent, of the amount collected on account of development charge comes from house building, public and private.&quot;
examined in great detail all the proposals which have been brought to their notice, and have been much helped by them in their review of the financial provisions. Three suggestions in particular have engaged their attention: the deferment of payments from the  300 million fund; the complete exemption of particular classes of development; and a general reduction of the rate ofthe charge.(i) Deferment of payment20. It has been suggested in a number of quarters, notably by the RoyalInstitution of Chartered Surveyors, that the  300 million fund should notbe paid out as the Acts require, but that instead holders of admitted claimsshould be issued with deferred payment certificates which would become payable when the land is compulsorily acquired or permission to develop isrefused, and which would be accepted in payment of development chargeat their full face value. This proposal was designed to avoid the inflationaryeffects of paying out the  300 million with interest, and at the same timeto provide owners of land approved for development with an incentive todevelop or to sell the land with the relevant certificate, that being the only means of realising the certificate. The extent to which the Government accept this proposal will be seen from Part III.(ii) Exemption of particular classes of development21. The exemption of particular classes of development, in particular of private housing and of all changes in the use of buildings, has been widelysuggested. The various possibilities have been examined but the conclusion reached is that no substantial exemptions could be made without giving rise to difficulties as great as those which now require solution. Development charge on private housing could not be abolished without upsetting the basis forassessment of the charge on municipal housing and indeed on many other forms of development and reducing the income from development charge toa negligible amountA Development charge on changes of use and on extensionscould not be abolished without penalising new buildings by comparison withold. Moreover, any wide extension of exemption would destroy the basictheory of the financial provisions: to prevent owners being compensated forrights which they were not losing it would be necessary to exclude thecorresponding development value from the claims on the  300 million fund.(iii) Reduction in the rate of development cliarge22. A reduction in the rate of development charge has been advocatedas a means of enabling developers to provide the - owner of land with someincentive to sell it for development without increasing their costs above whatthey would have been had the Acts not been passed. Amendment on theselines has considerable attraction though the reduction would have to be sub-stantial. to be effective say to 75 per cent, or 50 per cent. It would probably have to be coupled with deferment of payment to prevent the Exchequerhaving to pay in full or nearly in full for development values which they would subsequently sell at the reduced rate.23. The main difficulty in this proposition is that there can be no certainty that, even with a heavy reduction in the amount of development charge,land would normally change hands at a price that took account of thedeveloper&apos;s liability to pay whatever charge was levied. Vendors of land,like vendors of any other commodity, will always get the best price that they&quot;can, and the development charge, however small, would in effect be passed on, in whole or in part, to the ultimate user of the land.24. Moreover, the problem is not merely one of easing the market inland: the Government are anxious to encourage people who already own landsuitable for development to make use of it. Development charge even ata reduced rate would act as a deterrent, and would add to develop-ment costs. If reduction in the rate of the charge were accompaniedby deferment of payment of claims on the fund, and by an arrange-ment for setting off development charge against the claim, those who held claims on the fund and found themselves with little or nothing to pay would not be much affected; but even a reduction of 50 percent, would not avert the difficulties which must arise when the chargebegins greatly to exceed the corresponding claim on the fund. Nor, if therate of the charge were to be reduced, is there any clear principle why itshould stand at any particular figure; the process of reduction, once begun,would be difficult to stop.Conclusion25. For all these reasons the existing financial provisions appear to theGovernment to be unsatisfactory in themselves, and incapable of being suffi-ciently improved by modification. In particular; development charge is toounreliable an instrument to act as the lynch-pin of a permanent settlement.Accordingly the Government have reached the conclusion that a mere adjust-ment of the financial provisions is unlikely to provide a stable solution; andthey have decided that more drastic alterations must be made.
26. In the barest outline, Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose  J(1) to abolish development charge altogether;(2) not to pay out the  300 million fund, but to pay compensation for planning restrictions (subject to certain exceptions) as and whendevelopment of land is prevented or severely restricted;(3) to use the once-for all reckoning of the 1947 Acts as setting the upper limit of compensation payable for loss of development value i.e., com:pensation for planning restrictions will not exceed the value of the claimranking for payment from the fund, and compensation for compulsory acquisition will be based on the current value of the land for its existing use at the time of the acquisition plus any unexpended part ofthe claim (see paragraph 28).These proposals are explained in more detail in the following paragraphs.Abolition of Development Charge27. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are introducing immediately a Bill whichwill abolish development charge as regards all new projects. The Bill willprovide that no charge shall be payable in respect of development begun afterthe date of introduction, except where it has been included in a determination of development charge, or an application for a determination, with otherdevelopment carried out before that date.Compensation at 1947 Values28. The essence of the Governments proposals is to turn the payments for &quot; depreciation &quot; of the 1947 Acts into compensation payments which willnot be made until loss is actually sustained. They propose to pay for lossof development value up to 100 per cent, of the value of* claims admitted by the Central Land Board as qualifying for payment from the  300 millionfund. This will apply to compensation for compulsory purchase as well asto compensation for planning restrictions. Where some part of the admittedclaim has already been used to compensate for a partial restriction ofdevelopment, the amount payable on complete restriction or on compulsory acquisition will be correspondingly reduced. Some types of restriction willnot, however, carry any right to compensation (vide paragraph 34). Addi-tional compensation will be paid for abortive expenditure incurred in good faith on the strength of a planning permission which cannot be used becauseof a subsequent compulsory acquisition.29. Put in other words, the Oovernrnerit&apos;s decision is that it is reasonable to pay compensation for loss of development value which accrued in the past up to the point where the 1947 axe fell but not for loss of development value accruing in the future. If this principle were not maintained effective control of land use would again become impracticable, as it was before thewar. For the cost of compensation for restrictions; if it always had to bepaid at the peak value, would be crippling. The question what compensation should be paid on compulsory acquisition is difficult. But in practice the choice must lie between acquisition at current market value and acquisition;as proposed, at the current existing use value plus 1947 development value.When development plans have been approved, the market value of land will depend in large measure on the prospects of profit from the uses for which,&apos;in the light of the plan, permission is likely to be granted. Payment for development value at current market prices would therefore expose public authorities to the necessity of paying high prices for sites where, in the lightof the plan, those prospects were high, and owners to receiving low priceswhere the land was reserved, as sometimes it must be, for some comparativelyunprofitable use. In addition it would mean that public authorities wouldhave to pay prices enhanced by public. improvements carried out at public expense. For these reasons the Government have decided that the better course would be to base the compensation oh the current existing use valueplus the 1947 development value. :30. It may be suggested that to limit compensation in the way proposed1will work unfairly in certain cases. Land which in 1947 had little develop-^ment value, and therefore no claim or only a small claim on the fund, may at some future date acquire considerable development value. Values will,as explained, tend to follow the development plans, and land which acquiresa high development value will normally be land on which development willbe permitted; but there will be exceptions and it may be thought that to limit compensation in these cases will inflict hardship on owners who arerefused permission to develop-or, whose land is bought compulsorily. It isimportant, however, to remember that all: transactions in land since 1947have taken place in the full knowledge that the 1947 development value wasthe most that anyone :.could hope to receive by way of compensation from i* The expression &quot;admitted claim &quot; is used subsequently in this, paper.::       i.^,43194 : ;&quot;      &apos; &quot;    -      : &apos;&apos;&apos; B 3
the  300 million fund. Purchasers, in future will be able to safeguard them-selves by ensuring that permission to develop is forthcoming before theypay more than current existing use value or^ where a claim on the fund passeswith the land, current existing use value plus 1947 development value.The source of compensation31. Compensation for loss of development value through planning restric-tions will be paid from Central Government funds. In the case of compulsory purchase it is intended that as the acquiring authority will nolonger have to. pay development charge they should pay for loss of 1947development value as well as for current existing use value. The acquiringauthority will pay to the owner the admitted claim (or the unexpended balanceof the admitted claim): on the fund. Where there is interference with existing use in the interests of planning compensation will remain the responsibilityof local planning authorities.Special cases32. Special arrangements, will be made for compensation for restric-tions on and compulsory purchase of the land of local authorities, statutory undertakers and charities, in respect of which no claim on the  300 millionfund was admissible. The intention is to retain the &quot; prevailing, use valuebasis for the categories of land to which, it applies at present (i.e., certainland of local authorities, of statutory undertakers and the National coal board, and certain land held on charitable trusts or for ecclesiastical or othercharitable purposes). Special provision will also be made for adjustment ofpayments where two or more claims relating to different interests wereadmitted in respect of the same piece of land (vide paragraph 41); wherepayment has already been made under the war-damage scheme (Sections 59and1 56 of the- Acts) in respect of loss of development value; and in certain-other categories of case.Payment of interest33. As explained in paragraph 28, payment for loss of development value: will be- on the basis of the admitted claim. The Acts provide that interest should accrue on any sum due to be paid as. from the Appointed; Day(1st July, 1948). The underlying assumption was, that the payments wouldbe-, made within five years; and since, payments, are now to be deferred it isintended that interest should be. allowed to- accrue for a further, thoughlimited period. The duration of this further period is one of the. severalpoints to which further consideration will be given; but where development has: already been prevented, or the land has been acquired by a public authority the interest will certainly run- until payment is made.Exclusions from compensation for planning restrictions34. Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not intend that compensation shouldbe. payable in every case in which permission to develop is refused or con-ditions. are attached to a permission. They consider it reasonable to excludecompensation in respect of restrictions designed: to, preserve good neighbour-liaess; and there, is precedent for doing so in the. Planning Acts of 1932. Onthis principle compensation- will, not in general be payable for refusal toallow a change in the use of a building,, or refusal to allow a particular typeof building, or for restrictions on the size of a- building; nor for refusal topermit development which would place an undue burden on the community(e.gf, in the provision of services), or which would endanger public health orsafety. These are only examples and the precise extent of the exclusionsremains to be worked out. There will, of course, be no development chargetoi be paid when change of use is permitted.35. Provision will be made for a right of appeal in the ease of any dispute as to the amount payable in any particular case within the over-riding maximum of the claim.Use of powers of compulsory acquisition ^   ^___L______36; One result of the changes now proposed will be a free market in land.   This will make it easier for developers, to secure land, but there-----is^ji danger that the market price of land on which building is to beallowed^will^rise, perhaps steeply, in areas where such land, has to be severely limitedHay^planning (because of agricultural or mineral considera-tjons, or ..tbe.&apos;dfesire&apos;. tB*!testricttiifi. grpwth of towns). Whether this will inpractice, happen must be uncerfSirfe----^ut it might; and if it did the cost, to private, developers requiring land wouldTT5e--serious, the difference between theprice paid by public authorities for land for de^lopinent and the current market price might become too great, and the fortunateowrtess^whose land was allowed to be developed&apos; privately would attain a privileged&quot;&quot;TrositiQj^which would, offend the public conscience.
36. &quot; One result of the changes so far outlined is that there would be a -free market in land, in the sense that anyone would be able to offer land forsale at whatever price he thinks appropriate without the fear that his action might result in compulsory acquisition. This should make it easier fordevelopers to secure land, and should thereby promote private development which is an essential part of a balanced economy. There is, however, a danger that land-owners may try to stand out for too high a price for land which the local planning authority want to see developed, and which theyhave shown in their plan for early development. Whether this will happen in practice only time can show. But it might; and the Government have considered what measures may be necessary to prevent it. They do not intend that private developers should be held to ransom, nor that the proper course of development should be deflected.
37. Wide powers of compulsory acquisition already exist, not only toj;ensure that public authorities can acquire the land they need for public purposes, but also to enable them to make land available for private develop-ment in accordance with the provisions in their plan. Under the housing acts local authorities can and do buy land for disposal to private builders,where these builders have difficulty in getting a site at an appropriate price.These powers did not exist at the beginning of the century when the problemof land values first began to exercise Governments. The existing powers may need some simplification in order to enable local authorities to operate them,as necessary, to ensure that land which they want to see developed is madeavailable to private developers at a reasonable price; and this is being examined. Local authorities will be encouraged to use the powers in orderto prevent exploitation.37a. It may be asked how this proposal differs from the action taken bythe Central Land Board in acquiring land for the purpose of disposing of itat a price inclusive of development charge. The difference is that these latterpowers have been exercised on the initiative of an individual. The localauthority will exercise their powers of compulsory purchase where it is desiredto encourage development in the public interest, and the land which theyacquire will be available to anyone who will develop it in accordance withthe provisions of the plan.&quot;
37. Her^Majesty&apos;s Government do not intend to allow developers tobe held to ransom^ortc see the proper course of development distorted, andthey accordingly propose^ttjat local authorities should be encouraged to buycompulsorily land which isea*marked in their plans for early development in order to make it available to^pri^ate developers on reasonable terms,but without interfering with any existina local production until thedeveloper is ready to begin operations, ^^ide powers of acquisitionin order to bring land into development already&quot;exist, but these powersmay need some simplification to enable local authorities^to engage, as necessary, in acquisition for the purpose of disposal to anypessgn willingto develop in accordance with the provisions of the developments-plan.The usual procedure for compulsory acquisition with the customary safe--guards will apply. The powers of the Central Land Board to acquire land will, however, disappear as they are bound up with their function of collectingdevelopment charge.General38. The Government believe that the need to make radical amendmentsnow is established by the practical difficulties outlined in Part II. Their aimhas been to meet those difficulties but to keep everything which is essential toeffective planning, and to preserve 1947 development values as the permanent basis for compensation. There is no perfect solution, but that proposedappears to the Government to be the best in all the circumstances.39. One result of the Scheme will be that payments will becomedue from central funds on the decisions of local authorities. It will,therefore, be impossible for&apos; the Government to avoid some scrutiny of decisions when claims of compensation are made, particularly when theclaims are heavy. The Government do not, however, intend either to inter-fere unduly with the discretion of local authorities, or to allow the controlof land use to be dictated by financial consideration. If they were to allowfinancial considerations to dominate planning decisions the great efforts toprevent the loss of agricultural land and to limit the growth of towns, among other things, would be frustrated.Part IV. MiscellaneousTechnical and transitional problems40. The Government are aware that there are difficulties inherent in anyattempt to use the claims for loss of development value made under the 1947Acts as the basis of an ad hoc compensation scheme. These claims were intended to provide the information necessary for distributing-the  300 millionfund among owners who were adversely affected by the passing of the Acts :consequently they relate not to depreciation in the value of land but todepreciation in the value of interests in land existing in 1948. Where theinterest was a fee simple in possession this makes no difference: but wherethere existed a freehold and one or more leasehold interests the result maybe two or more claims in respect of the same piece of land. Moreover, theclaims are transmissible by assignment or by operation of law as personalproperty, and may therefore be in separate ownership from the interest inland to which they relate. But under the Governments proposals, as indeedunder any scheme for deferred payment of claims (e.g., that put forward by the Royal institution of Chartered Surveyors), the right to compensationmust run with the land.41. This change in the whole conception of the claims gives rise to anumber of serious technical problems which will in some cases permit only of rough and ready solution. Some claims relate to large areas of land; as and when these are split into smaller units it will be necessary to apportionthe claim in order to provide each unit with its appropriate compensationquota. Again, where separate claims were made in respect of differentinterests, it will be difficult to use these directly as the basis for compensationbecause by the time compensation becomes payable the interests in theland may no longer be the same as they were in 1948, and even where theyare their relative values will almost certainly have changed. The arrangementsfor making the necessary adjustments in these and other cases are beingworked out.42. A difficulty of a more general character arises from the need, under any scheme which provides for compensation to be paid as and when planning permission is refused, to prevent compensation being paid in cases where theowner applies for planning permission but has no present intention perhap seven no desire to develop his land. Sometimes the proposals will be merelypremature-development would not naturally have taken place until later;sometimes, as where the land is held for recreational purposes or to protect the amenities of adjoining property, it may be wholly fictitious. In some:cases, particularly where the land is held to safeguard the amenities of adwelling house, there may be no objection to granting the permission which
Paragraphs 45 to 4SSubstitute:45. &quot; There are two clear principles. The first is that there can be noquestion of repaying development charge as such. When a tax is altered orrescinded no question of repayment arises, and although development charge is not strictly a tax the same principle applies here. The second principle is that it is to the holder of the claim that any payment that is due, havingregard to the new proposals, should prima facie be made. It is the people who hold claims on the fund, and who will already have been damaged bythe time the full amending legislation is passed, who are entitled to considera-tion in the transitional arrangements.46. Certain cases are straightforward. As soon as the full amending legislation is passed, compensation must be paid for land which has been acquired by a public authority at existing use value. In these cases com-pensation will be paid up to the full value of the admitted claim plus accruedinterest. This will call for adjustments between the Exchequer and theacquiring authorities where the land is developed without development chargehaving to be paid.47. Compensation must also be paid where planning permission has been refused or revoked on the ground that the land ought to be restricted toits present use. In these cases, too, compensation will be paid up to thefull value of the admitted claim plus accrued interest. But where it is onlyone particular form of development which has been forbidden, the compensa-tion to be paid may, of course, be reduced or even eliminated altogether.
is ostensibly sought, in \ which case the difficulty vanishes. For the rest,provision will be made to ensure that no claim for compensation shall liewhen planning permission is refused solely on the grounds that development would be premature. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are considering what further steps should be taken to ensure that payment is only made as andwhen real loss is sustained. It may be desirable to provide that in specifiedcircumstances payment of compensation up to the full amount of the claimshall confer an option to acquire the land.43. Provision will have to be made for registering against the land themaximum compensation payable and any payments made, and for securing that compensation already paid is recovered from the developer in the eventof the planning decision being altered and development subsequentlyallowed. Payments made under Section 59 of the Act (Section 56 of theScottish Act), where the value payment received under the War Damage Actswas depressed, by the .presence of. development value &quot;in the site, will berecoverable in the same way if that development value is realised.44. Provision will also have to be made for effecting the transition fromthe old system to the new. In a number of cases the occasion for paymentof compensation, as provided by the new system, has already arisen or willhave arisen by the time the amending legislation is passed (see paragraph 51).Land has been or will be sold at existing use value in reliance on the claim on the fund, or the development of land to which a claim applies has beenor will be prevented by the refusal or the revocation of planning permission.Machinery must be devised for picking up these cases as soon as may be,and for making the appropriate payments.45. There are two clear principles. The first is that there can be noquestion of repaying development charge as such. When a tax is altered orrescinded no question of repayment arises, and although development charge is hot strictly a tax the same principle applies here. Further, the people whoseexpectations will be damaged by the new proposals are the people who holdclaims on the fund; and it is with their position that the Government mustprimarily deal. This is the second principle. It is to the holder of the claim that any payment should prima facie be made; only when his reasonable-xpectations have been met can the position of other parties be considered.Where, however, a claim has been assigned by the original holder to some person having no other interest in the land, the amount of the paymentmadeNto the assignee may be limited to the consideration given for it.46. ^As soon as the full amending legislation is passed and the necessary arrangements can be made, compensation will be paid for land which hasbeen acquired by a public authority at existing use value up to the full valueof the admitted claim plus accrued interest with apportionments where necessary. ThisNwill call for adjustments between the Exchequer and theacquiring authorities where the land is developed without development chargehaving to be paid. Gompensation relating to land for which planning permis-sion has been refused or revoked on the ground that it ought to be restricted to its present use will similarly be paid after any necessary apportionment.Where it is only One particular form of development which has been for-bidden, the compensation to\be paid may, of course, be reduced or eveneliminated altogether. \47. Claims will also qualify^ for payment where the land hasbeen developed and development charge paid. While development charge is not to be repaid as such, the fact that charge has been paid willwarrant payment on the claim. When theselaim is in the hands of the person who paid the charge, the claim will be meKup to the amount of the chargetogether with the relevant interest: any balance will be retained to providecompensation in the event of further development being restricted. Where,however, the person who paid charge and the person who holds the claimare not the same (because the land has changeaShands leaving the claimwith&apos;the former owner), regard must be had to the position of both parties.To pay the claim blindly to the holder would in manyNcases be to compen-sate him for something for which he had been paid already: on the otherhand, to divert the claim in all cases to the developer whc\paid the charge would be unfair to the owner who sold his land at or nekr existing use value. Her Majesty&apos;s Government therefore propose in cases OT^this type toapply the claim to making up the price already received for the land tothe amount of the 1947 unrestricted value, and to pay the balance\if any,to the developer. Where land has in the past changed hands apart from theclaim but no development has yet been carried out, payment will be made tothe holder of the claim on the same basis but the balance will be retairisduntil occasion for payment arises-e.g., permission for development is refused^[Arrangements will be made in these cases to recover the amount of thepayment from the developer if the: development value has been or is in futurerealised.] Wherever the claim relates to a larger area than the piece ;of land under consideration, payment will be confined to so much of the claim asrelates to that piece of land: claims &quot;which have already been accepted as security for development charge will pro tanto be reduced.
48. More difficult is the case where land has changed hands privately,&apos;with development in view, and the price at which it has changed handshas been affected by the 1947 Acts. Successive Governments have,urgedland-owners that they should sell the land at existing use value keepingtheir claim on the fund. Where an owner did this the claim ought to bepaid as soon as the full amending legislation is passed, just as claims areto be paid where land has been bought at existing use value by a public authority. But in many cases the land was sold at something above theexisting use value the vendor still keeping the claim; and in that case the vendor has already received, from the purchaser, a part payment for the1947 development value. The land may even have been sold at fullunrestricted value, the vendor still keeping the claim; in that case he hasalready been paid for the whole of his 1947 value. Her Majesty&apos;s government do not think that it would be right in these cases to pay the claim blindlyto the holder; and they propose only to apply the claim to making up theprice already received for the land to the amount of the 1947 unrestrictedvalue.48a. This leaves to be considered the position of the developer who has paid development charge. Although the Government do not propose to repaydevelopment charge as such, they cannot ignore the fact that a person whopaid charge and who holds an admitted claim, is entitled to expect some payment; when he paid the charge it was on the understanding that admittedclaims would be met. It is proposed that the holders of claims who have paid development charge shall be paid up to the amount of the charge withthe relevant interest; any balance being retained to provide compensation in the event of additional development being restricted. Further, on thethesis in the preceding praagraph, that the holders of admitted claims whohave sold land at something above existing use value shall be paid onlyso much as is needed to make up the price they got for the land to theamount of the 1947 unrestricted value, it is right that the balance shouldbe paid to the developer who paid development charge; for it is the pricehe paid for the land which has, in effect, reduced the amount which theGovernment will pay to the holder of the claim.48b. There will be cases where the land has been sold for development at something above existing use value, the vendor keeping the claim, butdevelopment has not yet taken place so that no development charge has been paid. If the Government is to pay the holder of the claim in these cases,payment ought to be recovered from the developer who has got his landcheap at the Governments expense. But it seems to the Government that itwould be very difficult as a matter of administration to recover the money in these cases, owing to the time lag between the abolition of development charge and the enactment of the full amending measure. They do not,therefore, propose to attempt recovery on future development, except as provided in paragraph 43.48c. In a number of cases a claim on the fund has been assigned by theoriginal holder to some person having no interest in the land. Such a claimwill only be met if it is one on which a payment is due to be made in accord-ance with the preceding paragraphs, and even then the amount of the pay-ment made to the assignee may be limited to the consideration given for it.Any increase in the number of cases of severance of this kind will complicate the process of transition, and it is highly desirable that the claims and the relevant interest in land should, as far as possible, pass together in all futuretransactions. The Government therefore propose that the right of assignmentshould generally be made subject to the approval of the Central Land Board.48d. Apportionment of the claim will be necessary under these arrange-ments wherever the land to which a claim applies is split up, or a planningdecision applies to only part of the land to which a claim applies.48e.   Claims which have already been accepted as security for develop-ment charge will pro tanto be reduced.
48. It will be apparent from the previous paragraphs that in some cir-cumstances claims which haveHDeen separated from the interest in land towhich they relate will qualify only for&quot;paTtiaL^ayment or may even qualify forno payment at all. For this reason, and because^anjncrease in the numberof cases of severance must complicate the process oftraiisitign, it is highly desirable that the claim and the relevant interest in land snouTd---so..4ar aspossible pass together in future in all transactions. The Government there-...fore propose that the right of assignment should be made subject to theapproval of the Central Land Board.Cost49. It is impossible to estimate with any accuracy the cost of theScheme or to compare it with the cost of carrying out the existing acts. On the one hand the Scheme involves the loss of the revenue fromdevelopment charge. This had, up to the 31st October, 1952, brought in 19% million, and revenue is accruing at the rate of about  8 million a year,a figure which would rise as the land which is free of charge becomes usedup. Against this loss of revenue must be set the fact that under the Schememany of the claims on the  300 million will never have to be paid. In manycases permission will be given to realise the development value of the land and the claim will be extinguished : in others no payment will be made becausethe restrictions imposed do not rank for compensation. Where land isacquired by a local authority or statutory undertaker payment of the claimwill be the liability of the authority or undertaker and not of the Exchequer.50. The initial liability on the Exchequer will undoubtedly be heavybecause it will include the cost of meeting all commitments incurred since 1st July, 1948. Payments in respect of land bought by public authorities and land on which development charge has been paid may amount to about 25 to  30 million, some part of which will be recoverable from local authori-ties. But payments in respect of restrictions already imposed cannot be evententatively estimated since it is not known what is the value of the claims on the land to which restrictions have been applied by local planning authori-ties, and even if it were, allowance would have to be made for the exclusionsfrom compensation which have not yet been denned. Once this backlog hasbeen overtaken, payments will be on a diminishing scale. No true comparisoncan in any event be made between the cost of the Scheme and that of thepresent system.Legislative Programme51. Owing to the Governments desire to allow plenty of time for dis-cussion of the Scheme and to the need for examination of the technical difficulties inherent in it, it will not be possible to introduce the main Billsembodying the Limited Compensation Scheme before the autumn of 1953.Meanwhile, as already stated in paragraph 26, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentare introducing immediately a Bill to abolish the liability to development charge in respect of future schemes of development. This interim Bill willalso remove the obligation laid on the Treasury by the present Acts to distribute the  300 million fund. Thirdly, the Bill will make the approval ofthe Central Land Board necessary to any assignment of a claim on the 300 million fund after the date of introduction. The remainder of the changes proposed in this memorandum will only come into effect when themain Bills have been passed; in the meantime the provisions of the 1947Acts will continue to have effect.52. Deferment of the main Bills until the next Session means that itwill not be possible to start making payments until the autumn of 1954. TheGovernment regret this, but they fear that it is inescapable. They have considered whether it would be possible to take power in the interim Billto make payments at once in the most urgent cases, but they are satisfiedthat it would not be practicable to distinguish one class of case from another,or to start making payments at all until the whole Scheme has been enacted.The provision that claims on the fund which rare due to be met under thenew Scheme will be paid in full and that interest will accrue for a further period, should go some way to assuage the disappointment of owners whosecase for payment has already arisen; and every effort will be made to dealwith the most urgent cases as soon as the main Bills are passed.
