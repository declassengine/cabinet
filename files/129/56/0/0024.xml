(52) 86th Conclusions, Minute 2). I am circulating for the information ofmy colleagues the results of this examination.2. These manoeuvres, which are entitled &quot; Exercise LONGSTEP,&quot; are beingcarried out under the direction of Admiral Carney between 3rd and 13th November.They comprise the movement of convoys through the Western and Central Medi-terranean, the operation of carriers against the convoys and against selected landtargets, amphibious landings in Algeria and Southern Turkey and submarine and anti-submarine operations.3. General Ridgway had asked the Standing Group of N.A.T.O. to obtainpolitical clearance for this exercise. After we had obtained additional detailsabout the area of operations, the Foreign Secretary and I were satisfied that theproposed manoeuvres did not give rise to any political objections and our repre-sentative on the Standing Group was informed accordingly. The Standing Grouphave now given authority for the exercise to proceed.4. The Foreign Secretary and I were concerned at the short notice we weregiven for considering the political aspects of the manoeuvres. However, theStanding Group of N.A.T.O. have now drawn up a procedure under which thepolitical aspects of projected manoeuvres will be examined at an early stage intheir preparation and this procedure will shortly be considered by the north atlantic Council.A.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,30th October, 1952.43136Printed for the Cabinet.
