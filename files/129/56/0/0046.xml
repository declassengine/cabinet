Printed for the Cabinet.   November .1952CONFIDENTIALC. (52) 3967th November, 1952Copy No.63CABINETHOUSINGMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local government at the Cabinet Meeting on 24th July, 1952, C.C. (52) 73rd Conclusions,Minute 8, the Cabinet AgreEd that the limitations imposed by the Investment programme should not operate to prevent the Housing Ministers from reaching theirtarget of building 260,000 houses in 1953.In asking for a target of 260,000 houses in 1953, I said that the programme was already largely covered by houses under construction or in approved tenders.Consequently the material and labour requirements were already fixed. It was alsoimpossible to reduce the target without a disruption in the building industry, theconsequences of which would be exceedingly grave.2. This Cabinet decision enabled me to go forward with confidence, and thefirst step of 230,000 houses to be completed in .1952 seems assured.3. At the beginning of October 1952 there were 275,263 houses under construction against the planned figure at the end of the year of 280,000 houses under construction to meet the 1953 programme of 260,000 completions and tocontinue building thereafter.   I do not think our provision will prove excessive.4. It was agreed that the programme for 1954 should be finally agreed inNovember of this year.5. Meanwhile, I have been taking steps to economise in materials and labourso that, if it is decided that the expansion should go on in order to meet our electionpledges, this can take place with the minimum reduced call upon man-power and materials.6.  The steps I have taken are (a) Smaller HousesThe People&apos;s House has been introduced successfully. Althoughcertain local authorities, notably the London County Council, have notyet adopted them, two-thirds of the local authority houses approved each month are now of the People&apos;s House type. In consequence the averagearea of all local authority three-bedroom houses now being approvedis down by 10 per cent, and of two-bedroom houses by 6 per cent. the saving in cost on a three-bedroom People&apos;s House is some 10 per cent.(b) Non-Traditional HousesI am expanding the proportion of honKtraditional houses and at theend of September 13 per cent. (37,636) of all houses under constructionwere of this type. I am interesting fiurther national firms and hope toshow increasing progress in this direction with savings of bricks and skilled labour on the building sites.43183
(c) Saving Foreign ExchangeWith a view to savings in foreign exchange I have caused prototypehouses to be built, each illustrating various methods of substitution forsoftwood and 1 am hoping that in 1954 additional houses can be builtwithout a corresponding increase in timber consumption.7.   I would also wish to inform the Cabinet as to the labour situation.8. The total number employed in the Building Industry is now about one million.It shows a slight reduction compared with the number employed when we took office. Of the total labour force, at the 1st January, 1952, housing accountedfor 226,000. The latest figure available is at the 31st August, 1952, when thefigure was 276,000.But we have not drawn labour away from other new building, for the figureemployed on new building construction (other than houses) has remained stationary.It is clear, and it is confirmed by enquiries at the building sites, that we areattracting back to house building the small builder who, since the war, has been engaged so largely in high-priced repairs and decoration, legal and illegal. Addi-tional labour has been released to us by the run down of the war damage repairprogramme. The Housing Programme is also providing employment for surplusmaintenance labour from industry, for whom there is now less employment owingto the greater care which has been exercised in this respect under the more stringenttrading conditions now ruling.9. We are in a position to build houses at the rate of 300,000 a year in 1954without, in my view, any detriment to the necessary building programmes for defence, industry, agriculture, education, &amp;c.10. On the assumption that we are to build at the rate of 300,000 houses ayear in 1954, the question arises through what agencies they will be provided.11. The number under construction at the 30th September, 1952, was 275,263made up as follows :  Local Authorities and Housing Associations      219,206New Towns.............      ... 8,829Government Departments .........        10,854Private Enterprise12. The actual completions for 1951, and my estimate for 1952 (provided the target of 230,000 houses is not exceeded) and my estimate for 1953 (based on260,000 houses) is shown in the following table.	1951	1952	1953	(Actual)	(Est.)	(Est.)Local Authorities and Housing			Associations         ...	161.743	184,000	190,000New Towns      ......	2,638	6,000	10,000Government Departments	7,899	10,000	15,000Total for letting    ......	172,280	200,000	215,000Private Enterprise       ......	22,551	30,000	45,000	194,831	230,000	260,00013. In 1954 we should look to private enterprise to supply the expansion inthe programme.14. To increase private building, I gave permission, in December 1951, tolocal authorities to issue private licences at the rate of one private for one house to let as against 1 in 5. In August 1952, I gave permission to local authorities to ignore the 1 for 1 ratio where they wished to issue additional licences for private building. It is expected that this will result in some 15,000 extra licences by theend of this year.238,889 (Total for letting)36,374275,263
15. I would recommend that it would now be desirable to ease the conditions under which private house-building can be done and to announce this immediately following the introduction of the Bill to abolish Development Charges.16. At the present time in deciding whether to issue a licence for private building, local authorities have regard to &quot; comparable need,&quot; although some, onideological grounds, do not issue licences at all. We can either substitute a muchmodified test of need (see Appendix) or permit private building without a needstest at all. The objection to the latter will be the political argument against thepossibility of a country cottage or a seaside bungalow being built by a man whois already housed.17. We must continuing licensing in order to limit the size of the house and tocontrol the issue of permits for scarce materials (timber and steel). By doing sowe shall also be enabled to regulate the flow of licences in order to control both theprogramme as a whole and its application to the different Regions so as not tointerfere with other building requirements.18. Action is in hand to study with the Treasury what measures are necessary and practicable to ensure a continued demand for private building.19. While the position is somewhat different in Scotland, particularly withregard to the extent to which private enterprise is likely to supply the expansion ofthe programme, the Secretary of State for Scotland authorises me to say that heagrees generally.20.   I would ask Cabinet approval-(a) to the target of 300,000 houses a year in 1954;(b) to a modification in the conditions under which licences lor private building will be issued.(either with no test of need or with the modified test set out in theAppendix.)H. M.7th November, 1952.APPENDIX&quot;NEED&quot;Modified TestA person who wants to build a house or to buy or rent a newly-built houseother than a Council house, for his own occupation should be required to establishto the satisfaction of the local authority for the area in which he now resides thathe is in genuine need of a house on the grounds that he is:  (a) not already the owner or occupier of a house or flat which is available forhis occupation; or(b) living in accommodation below reasonable habitable standards havingregard to the size and composition of his family; or(c) in need because of the size and composition of his family-of a bigger orsmaller house than he now occupies and will make the latter availablefor sale or letting; orid) living in a Council house or as a licensee in requisitioned premises andwants to live in a house of his own; or(e) employed or about to be employed in another district and intending tovacate his present house which will thereupon become available forsale or letting; or(/) in need of a house for some other reason comparable, in view of the localauthority, to those enumerated above.
