Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1952SECRETC. (52) 3803rd November, 1952CABINETCOMMONWEALTH ECONOMIC CONFERENCE: COMMODITY policy memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and the Chancellorof the Duchy of lancaster the Report of the Preparatory Meeting of Officials C. (52) 373 records full commonwealth agreement (C.E.C. (O) (52) 22, Section A) on the general proposi-tion that violent fluctuations in the prices of the major primary commodities can have serious effects on the balance of payments and on the economies of Common-wealth countries, whether producers or consumers; and that greater stability isa goal to be aimed at. It is useful to have this on record. But the Report doesnot, in itself, recommend any precise series of measures to reduce- instability.Indeed, United Kingdom officials were instructed to avoid the detailed considera-tion of individual commodities. &apos; -2. The interests of individual Commonwealth countries are divergent accord-ing to their position as producers or consumers of primary commodities. the conflicting interests of the United Kingdom itself clearly illustrate this dilemma.General discussions about commodity problems, therefore, tend to concentrate on the formulation of principles and procedures which, although an essential pre-requisite to action, leave open the question what to do in particular cases.3. United Kingdom policy in this field is difficult to frame because of the conflicting considerations we have to take into account. Greater stability is inour interests and in the interests of,the Commonwealth as a whole. But, when we consider the means of achieving it, we have to bear in mind the position of theUnited Kingdom as a major importer of food-stuffs and raw materials on the onehand and our interests, on the other, in the well-being of the under-developedCommonwealth countries (especially the Colonies) and in a regular and remunera-tive level of earnings from the primary commodities which the sterling area exports.Moreover, if buffer stocks are involved in any, measures, money will have to beprovided from the Exchequer. .-4. This problem is illustrated by reference to the following notes on certainprimary commodities on which international.discussions have taken place sincethe war or are now in progress;i .,r .(a) WheatThe International Wheat Agreement is the only commodity I agree-ment in operation.   It has set floor and ceiling prices which, as things&apos; have turned out, have probably saved us heavy dollar expenditure.  Inthe negotiations for its renewal for a further period of years which took*   place in London in the summer, we (in common with other Common-wealth wheat importers like India, Ceylon and the Colonies) have beenresisting heavy pressure from the exporters (who include Canada and australia) for higher prices.   We have made it clear that we are not committed in principle to a new agreement, but will assess its possible advantages against those of doing without an agreement.  The negotia-r        tions are to be resumed in Washington in January and a submission will&apos;        be made to Ministers before Christmas to decide on the instructions tobe given to the United Kingdom Delegation.   The United States and&quot;r \!   :i Canada are both certain to exert strong pressure on us to agree to a: 1 1 renewal of the existing agreement at higher prices. The issue is whetherthe cost (in the widest sense) of continued stability is worth i paying.Copy No.    1-743155
(b) SugarWe may have to take part in negotiations next year for an Inter-national Sugar Agreement which will aim at stability by restricting exports.Cuba (and the United States) are pressing for this. The complicationsfor us are that: (i) we are committed by the Commonwealth sugar agreement to continuing expansion of Commonwealth sugar productionand exports, and (ii) an international agreement may keep the cost (largely,a dollar cost) of our purchases of non-Commonwealth sugar higher thanit might be.(c) Rubber \vi the International Rubber Study Group has been since the summerexploring the desirability and possible forms of a commodity agreement,:&apos;^ 1 in the face of a prospective surplus of natural rubber capacity and corn-petition from the United States synthetic industry.  Ceylon and Malaya: : are among those who favour such international action.  Her Majesty&apos;s;Government has taken an active part in this study, without commitment on either principle or detail.  Greater stability of price is politically and!   economically important for Malaya.   But a buffer stock (probably thej.! &apos;Y; only practicable mechanism in this case) would involve financial problems,    (including a charge on the United Kingdom budget), and it is uncertain whether the United States could be persuaded to participate in an agree-:     ment, as would be essential.  The rubber-using industry in the UnitedKingdom and the United Kingdom-based plantation interests in Malaya.; !    have advised against agreement, believing that natural rubber ought to,n be left to find its own level in a free market in competition with synthetic^always provided that synthetic rubber is priced on a truly commercial:. ::. basis. We have under consideration at present detailed proposals on these&apos;.. which cover, inter alia, the budgetary implications.(d) CottonThe United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, India and Pakistan are members of the. International Cotton Advisory Committee which has;for a year been exploring possible forms of an agreement.  The United&quot;   States is the largest world producer, and by her policy of acreage control&apos; and price support largely influences the world price.  Pakistan is aconsiderable, and the Colonies are small, producers; but the sterling area/as a whole is a large net importer.  No Commonwealth country has,    committed itself to the desirability of an agreement (Pakistan is probably&apos;v hostile). Because cotton is a dollar commodity, there are special difficulties&apos;!  in committing ourselves to any minimum prices, and because it is impera-tive that Lancashire should have access to supplies on terms no less1favourable than its competitors, the technical difficulties in the way of anagreement acceptable to the United Kingdom are formidable.   At onetime, the United States was the foremost protagonist of an agreement,,     and her interest might revive at any time.   She might well regard acotton agreement as a logical corollary to any support which she might give to agreements for other commodities of which she is a large importer.(e) TinThe United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, India and the british colonial and Dependent Territories are represented on the InternationalTin Study Group.  Between 1948 and 1950 the draft of a Tin Agreement* was drawn up; but the negotiating conference in 1950 failed to achieve;     success, largely owing to the unwillingness of the Americans and to theI--!1! difficulties of settling floor and ceiling prices in the circumstances of the:   post-Korea commodity boom. Subsequent experience of unilateral action by the United States Government to keep down prices during the periodof scarcity was unhappy, and the import of tin to the United States on private account has been only recently restored.   There will, however,almost certainly be a surplus of tin when United States stockpiling is com-pleted, and this could have serious consequences for Malaya. The situation should therefore be watched, so as to take such opportunity as arises forattempting to reopen negotiations for an agreement if conditions sorequire.
(/) WoolThe United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand,Pakistan and South Africa participate in the work of the InternationalWool Study Group. A Reserve Prices Plan (a form of stabilisation agree-ment) was drawn up in 1951 between the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, with the knowledge and provisional approval of the Study Group, but fell through owingto the refusal of the Australian growers to participate. New Zealandhas since adopted a national price stabilisation scheme; and South Africahas recently been contemplating a similar measure. The Wool Industryin the United Kingdom, while desiring a greater stability of prices, issuspicious of Governmental or international action to that end. It isessential that any plan for wool should not interfere with the auctions.The plan which the Australians rejected would have left the auction systemintact.5. It thus appears that there is no easy road to reducing instability by inter-national action. The approach of the United Kingdom to the negotiation ofcommodity agreements is subject to conflicting considerations in almost every case.Even in those cases where the balance of United Kingdom advantage lies in trying to secure an international agreement, there are serious risks that we might be forced into a position disadvantageous to ourselves in the course of negotiations. More-over, we could not expect to secure agreement in those commodities and on those terms where stability would be most beneficial to us without making it difficultto reject proposals in others where we might consider the price for stability too high.6. There are four main topics on which it is essential that we go into con-ference with a clear line.  These are:  (a) Stable United States purchases of sterling area primary products;(b) International commodity agreements;(c) Possible emergency arrangements to deal with a general slump or scarcity;(d) The question of an approach to the United States Administration on any,or all, of the above.7. Stable United States Purchasing. The United States dominates inter-national trade in primary commodities. The question, therefore, arises whether we should seek Commonwealth support to press upon United States authorities thatthey should take deliberate Government action to maintain a high and stablevolume of imports into the United States of primary commodities. e.g., rubber, tin,wool, &amp;c. It is very doubtful whether this approach is practicable or indeed in our interests. Although the United States Government has in the past few yearsengaged in Government purchase of many commodities, this has been mainly for strategic purposes and to deal with post-Korean scarcity. United States imports are normally bought on private account, and in recent months Governmentpurchase has been abandoned except for their strategic stockpiles. Their stockpilesof Sterling Area commodities are now nearly full and they have no legal power touse them for purposes of stabilisation. Moreover, even if they did so, this would tend to place in the hands of the United States Administration with all theinfluences and pressure to which it may be subject the power to determine market conditions as they may think fit at any time. Recent experience suggests that, theywould not use that power wisely. For these reasons we conclude that we shouldnot seek to secure greater stability of American purchases, by means of an extensionof Government buying. If therefore we are to seek United States co-operation,it must be by Way of international action.8. International Commodity Agreements. There are three main alter-natives:  (1) To try to get commodity agreements for as many sterling area commodities as possible, recognising that this may weaken our ability to resistundesirable agreements,(2) To adopt a policy of opposition to commodity agreements.(3) To proceed as at present with the empirical examination of individual commodities case by case within the internationally accepted framework of principles and procedures.
9. Commodity agreements are difficult to bring about because of the technical problems of each commodity and the divergence of interest between producing andconsuming countries. They are costly (e.g., in direct financial outlay for a bufferstock or in payment of higher prices for imports at certain times). They almostinvariably involve governmental interference with private trade; they may affect theworkings of terminal markets; and they are often viewed with suspicion by tradersand industrialists. Above all, there is strong opposition in the United States toagreements affecting products which she imports (though often pressure from theUnited States Government for agreements on commodities which she exports).Finally, commodity agreements even under favourable conditions take a long timeto negotiate.10. On the other hand, against the costs and difficulties of seeking to securestability, must be weighed the potentially greater costs in terms of the sterling area as a whole of taking no action at all where trade and production are threatened with the return of violent fluctuations in commodity prices (quite apart from the coststo individual countries of separate action to protect themselves). If we permittedthese difficulties and dangers to lead us to adopt a policy of opposition to com-commodity agreements (alternative (2)), it would involve a major reversal of policy,It would mean the abandonment of internationally accepted principles and pro-procedures which, inter alia, protect countries like the United Kingdom from the dangers of producer-dominated cartels. It would be strongly opposed by themajority of Commonwealth countries; by western European countries and evenby the United States.11. Nevertheless, the difficulties outlined in paragraphs 5 and 9 above mustbe faced if we adopt alternative (1) or alternative (3), though with alternative (3)we would retain greater freedom of action. Alternative (3) means that we would continue to participate in the international discussions of wheat, sugar, rubber and cotton which are now going on and of tin, wool and possibly other commoditieswhen the time is ripe. But we should do so with no positive bias in favour of anagreement in principle in any particular case. Our attitude would be determinedby the terms on which an acceptable and practicable agreement, seemed likely to emerge. This is the course of action which the Report of Officials reflects and itcommands the highest common measure of agreement among the commonwealth countries. Moreover, if we reject all consideration of commodity agreements wemay well find it more difficult to secure inter-Imperial or international agreements in the other spheres where we definitely want it. We therefore recommendalternative (3). But it must be recognised that its results are likely to be slow andwe cannot be sure of covering enough of the field.12. Possible Emergency Arrangements. There has developed workable and generally acceptable international machinery for the discussion of commodity agreements on the lines of alternative (3). It could work as quickly and as effec-tively as the Governments concerned were prepared to work it. It could alsocope with alternative (1). But, with the best will on all sides, the conclusion ofsatisfactory long-term commodity agreements takes time. The Report of Officialstherefore discusses the possibility of additional arrangements for calling Govern-ments together to consider immediate action if emergency conditions, whetherslump or scarcity, were to develop. The aim would be to mobilise opinion widelyso as to secure rapid consideration of possible action by the Governments princi- ^ ,pally concerned, especially the United States. The International Monetary-iWwa^^(r4*^^.GefttpoL has achieved a measure of success in dealing thus with emergencies of&quot;shortage, though valuable months were wasted in setting it up. It must, of course,be recognised that dealing with surplus conditions would be altogether more complex, contentious and costly.13. The Report does not go into detailed arrangements. We do not wantany new formal organisation (with all the possible arguments about its composition,its terms of reference, its internal procedures and its relationship with existingbodies). Nor do we want to divert effort from the practical consideration of anypromising measures which may be evolved under the existing arrangements forcommodities in which we have a major interest. What is required is a clear under-standing amongst leading Governments upon a recognised method of calling themtogether if emergency conditions appear imminent.
j/14. An Approach to the United States. The United States dominates inter-national trade in primary commodities. Public opinion there is becoming increas-ingly conscious of the political and economic dangers of violent fluctuations incommodity prices and trade. Some expectation that we shall raise the largerquestions about commodities with the United States Administration has been expressed in public comment on both sides of the Atlantic. We should discuss with our Commonwealth colleagues what approach, if any, should be made on the subjects dealt with in this paper. We must now therefore decide on one or a combination of the following courses:  (a) whether to suggest an approach to the United States Administration with proposals for Government action to stabilise United States purchases of sterling area primary products (paragraph 7); we are against this;(b) which of the three alternative attitudes to adopt to International Com-commodity Agreements (paragraph 8); we recommend alternative (3);(c) whether we should pursue the idea of securing emergency arrangements to deal with a general slump or scarcity (paragraph 12); we are infavour of this.P.
