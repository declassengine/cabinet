Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (52) 3717th October, 1952CABINETHIGHER TECHNOLOGICAL education memorandum by the Lord President of the council. It is vital for our survival that the efficiency and productivity of our industry should rapidly increase. We must have a steady flow of new processes and new products.2. We cannot achieve these ends without a minor revolution in our industrialoutlook. To bring about such a revolution it is, I believe, essential for the nation to train, and for our industries to mobilise, a new race of technologists and appliedscientists, chemical engineers, and the like.3. We are, of course, training many technologists now. Table I shows thenumbers at institutions of university rank, and Table II the subjects of their study.I have been told by industrialists and others that our university-trained engineers and higher technologists are often too academic; the higher technological coursesdo not seem to be attracting the highest types. The men trained at the technical colleges, below university level, play a useful part in industry, but they are in themain too specialised and not sufficiently high powered for the objective I have inmind.   Some other countries seem to manage these matters better.4. If we are to get the surge forward and the change in outlook which isessential, we must take some step which will excite the imagination and inspireteachers, students and industry. It was with this general object that some of us,the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Pay-master-General, the Minister of Education and I came to the Conclusion a little time ago that we must build up one or more higher technological institutions. Inthe announcement which the Chancellor and I made in Parliament on 11th june last we said &quot; The Government consider that a most important means of increasing productivity in industry is to improve facilities for higher technological education. They are convinced that this can best be done by building up atleast one institution of university rank devoted predominantly to the teaching and study of the various forms of technology. We are, therefore, urgentlyexploring the practical possibilities as to the best way of doing this.&quot;5. Our decision as to how to implement this policy will determine the courseof higher technological education for many years to come. I think the matter is so important that our colleagues in the Cabinet should be informed about it. Wehave now to take decisions, and that is why I have put this paper to the Cabinet.6. Last June, when we made our announcement, the Chancellor asked theUniversity Grants Committee (U.G.C.) to advise on how it might be implemented.In the remit to the U.G.C. they were told that building up the Imperial College of science and Technology might well be the best way of achieving the Government^aim, but they were asked not to overlook the possibilities of the Royal TechnicalCollege, Glasgow.7. The U.G.C. submitted their report some weeks ago. They have comedown strongly in favour of making a start on a single institution only, namely theImperial College of London University. They do not recommend more thannormal development elsewhere for the present. They say that the major expansion43143
which Imperial College would regard as practicable would be growth up to 3,000students in the quinquennium 1962-67 with a possible expansion to 4,000 after1967. The estimates made two years ago for this expansion envisaged a capitalexpenditure of  6 million on building, spread over fifteen years. The annual grant to the college would be trebled, from the 1949-50 figure of  600,000 to about 1,800,000.8. I agree with the plan to expand Imperial College, but I am very concerned on two aspects of it. The first is that from the figures given in the U.G.C. report it does not look as if the expansion could be very rapid. They say that the majorexpansion could not be expected to fructify in increased student numbers until after 1957. They discuss various site difficulties. I should hope that it might bepossible to get on speedily with the building programme, though even if everythingworks out favourably this will take time. But this matter is a most urgent one and, for psychological reasons apart from anything else, a rapid and tangible step forward is essential now.9. Apart from the apparent slowness of the Imperial College plan, I feel sure that we must do something to develop our new policy at other places than London.An expansion of Imperial College will not fire the imagination and will pass almostunnoticed,in London. It will not enlist the support which local industrialists inour manufacturing areas have already offered. I feel sure that if we only expandImperial College we shall be strongly criticised politically for our failure to developany of these new technological centres in the places where they are vitally needed.5 V 10. I regard the ultimate object of this whole policy to be the bringing aboutof nothing less than a technical revolution in British industry. To achieve this, Iconsider that we have to mobilise the technically-minded young people in the indus-tfial districts, i.e., primarily Scotland, the North, the Midlands, and Wales. by virtue of their long industrial tradition, the people in these areas have, I believe,acquired an inherent instinct for craftsmanship. They would therefore providefor universities of technology a source of students with traditional aptitude forthe practical application of scientific knowledge to industrial processes. If wechoose provincial centres for these developments, this very fact should be bothan initial, and a continuous, inspiration to the neighbourhood and to local industryand industrialists.11. I therefore wish to argue strongly that, in addition to the Imperial Collegeplan which I support, we should develop at least one or two higher technologicalinstitutions in other places. I have an open mind as to which these places should be,but a natural choice would be the two other institutions already financed by theU.G.C. as giving technological teaching of university level, and solely concernedwith technology, namely the Royal Technical College, Glasgow, and the ManchesterMunicipal College of Technology.12. In the case of both Glasgow and Manchester Technical Colleges it for-unfortunately happens that extensions are in progress which should enable more rapidresults to be obtained there than at Imperial College:(a) Glasgow: Royal Technical CollegeThis is, as Table I shows, the largest of the university-rank tech-nological institutions in this country, with about a thousand students. Itis 150 years old. I understand that extensions now under constructionwill enable the present student body to be increased by approximately one-third, say, 300-400 students.(b) Manchester College of TechnologyThis is also a large College with some 800 students of universitylevel studying technology, but the proportion of degree work is much. lower than that at Glasgow.  The U.G.C comment that &quot;the directionof the College has not of recent years been as lively as that of the Royal. Technological College, Glasgow.&quot;  The College is undoubtedly suffering. from uncertainty as to its future status, and it is at present without a,;,. Principal. But these uncertainties have not deterred them from a building programme and when extensions at present under construction are cOm-plete, which is expected to be in 1955, it should be possible to increase&apos;i the under-graduate figure by 25 per cent, to 33 per cent, (and the post-&apos; graduate figure, at present 150, by an appreciably higher1 percentage);:&apos;       - The College has four chairs at present^ but they are hoping to have five1 11     more within the next five years and a further five more after that. :
13. On organisation, the U.G.C. refer to difficulties between the Royal Tech-nical College and Glasgow University about their relative status; at Manchesterthe relationship between the College and the University will also have to be worked out, and there is also a problem because the Technical College is at present con-trolled by Manchester City Council. Regarding Glasgow, I would emphasise theimportance of reaching an early settlement of the difficulties which have arisen with the assurance that if this can be done the necessary finance will be availablefor this forward move at Glasgow which I suggest. As to Manchester, furtherattention will no doubt be given to the status of the Technical College; I have some reason to think that the problem of the present municipal control could be resolvedfairly easily.14. My suggestion then is that we should include the Royal Technical College,Glasgow, and Manchester College of Technology or, alternatively, other placesoutside London which may be considered to have better claims under our plan ofbuilding up technical institutions of university rank, and that we should make thenecessary finance available for this.15. One suggestion on finance might be that if we get this American money &quot; Conditional Aid &quot; we might put, say,  1 million from the Counterpart Fundaside for the development of higher technological education outside London.16.   My own views on this matter can be summarised as follows:  (a) I agree with the recommendation of the University Grants Committee thatwe should proceed to build up Imperial College in accordance with our policy (paragraph 8).(b) But I do not think that this is enough, and I advance various reasons whyI consider that it is essential for us also to go forward with our policyoutside London (paragraphs 9 and 10).(c) The University Grants Committee also finance, as giving technologicalteaching of university level, the Royal Technical College, Glasgow, andthe Manchester Municipal College of Technology. It happens thatbuildings are actually going up at these two places which would enablethem to expand appreciably in the next few years. I suggest that thesetwo institutions or others in the provinces that might be considered tohave better claims should be included in our scheme for building uphigher technological institutions of university rank and that we should provide the necessary finance for this (paragraphs 12-14). .W.Privy Council Office, S.W.
