secret. (52) 382 COPY NO.4th NOVEMBER, 1952.CABINETMOVE OF THL MIDDLE EAST HEADQUARTERSMemorandum&apos;by the Minister of Defence.I was invited by theCabinet to consider with the Chancellor of theExchequer to what extent authority could be given for the starting of work on anew Joint Headquarters in Cyprus without prejudice to larger issues of defence policy in the Middle East   (C.C.(52) 91st Conclusions, Minute 7).   I understandthat the Foreign Secretary is anxious that theCabinet should consider thismatter before he leaves for the United States on the evening of November 7th.In the time available I have not been able to reach agreement with the Chancellorof theExchequer and the proposals in this paper represent my own views.   TheChancellor will no doubt give his opinion when the paper is discussed in Cabinet.2. It is clear that the most we should be able to retain in Egyptunder any defence settlement would be a Base and its associated air defence.   Wemay very well have to be content with no more than the Base itself.   If we fail to reach a settlement with Egypt we shall have no rights to maintain any forces there at all when the present Treaty expires in 1956,   We must therefore in any case plan on the basis that the Middle East Headquarters willhave to be moved within four years.3. There would be considerable political advantages in startingnow with preparations for the transfer of the Headquarters elsewhere.   Themost important of these is that the move cannot take place for at least eighteen months after work actually starts:  thus, unless we take time by the forelock, wemay find that our inability to remove the Headquarters in what Egypt would regard as a reasonable time would become an obstacle to a new agreement.   Todecide to start preparations now would not be a decision taken under pressure of negotiation and could be expected to have a good effect on Egyptian opinion.We are not strictly entitled under the 1936 Treaty to have in Egypt aHeadquarters for the whole of the Middle East and the fact that we intended tomove the Headquarters could not be taken as an indication that we attached anyless importance to the retention of the Base or of the troops provided for by theexisting Treaty,4, From the military point of view Cyprus is the best site for anew Headquarters whatever the size and deployment of our forces in the middle east.   It is British territory and is centrally situated.   A suitable site hasbeen provisionally selected with the agreement of the Government of Cyprusat Episkopi, 15 miles west of Limassol on the South Coast.   From the military point of view also it is necessary that the transfer should not have to becarried out in undue haste.5, It is proposed to station at Episkopi the Joint headquarters in the Middle East together with such Units and Organisations as are necessaryfor its support and local administration.   In determining the size of the Joint
Idquarters it has been assumed that the peacetime Garrison will be reducedto one Division and 160 Royal Air Force front-line aircraft.   I must emphasizehowever that the size of the Headquarters is governed far more by its functions,including intelligence, peace and war planning and all aspects of administrationfor the whole of the theatre, than by the size of the Garrison which it controls.For this reason and bearing in mind the complex nature of the military and semi-political problems governing the whole of the Middle East theatre withwhich the Headquarters has to deal 1 do not expect that the figures which Igive below, although subject to further detailed examination, will be capableof much reduction as far as theArmy is concerned.   In the case of the RoyalAir Force a reduction might be made only if it is decided further to reduce thenumber of front-line aircraft below 160,Joint Headquarters Personnel CiviliansRoyal Navy 93Army                                             582 161Air Force                                      551 112Other Army Units 744 443chiefly AdministrativeOther Air Force Unitschiefly Administrative 241 207Joint Service Unitsincluding Signals(details are given at Annex) 873 178Totals 3,084 1,1016. I do not, however, suggest that at this stage approval should be givento the ultimate size of, or scale of expenditure on, the new Headquarters in Cyprus.To achieve the purposes described in paragraphs 3 and 4 what is needed now isapproval in principle for the move to take place and authority for expenditureon certain preliminary works services.   These preliminary works are in no way affected by the ultimate size of the cantonment or by the strength of theHeadquartersand other organisations to be accommodated there.   The mostimportant works services would be the construction of a temporary power station, a labour camp, water supply and roads and first purchases of building materials (mainly cement).7. I therefore recommend that the Cabinet should:-(a) approve in principle the transfer of Joint Headquarters,Middle East, to Cyprus on the understanding that the maximumeconomy will be observed at all stages and particularly in thescale of office accommodation to be provided;(b) authorise the Service Departments to draw up detailed plans for the move;  and(c) authorise expenditure on such preparatory work as can becarried out in advance of a firm decision on the size of the headquarters, up to a limit of  500,000, subject to the normaldetailed financial scrutiny,A.Ministry of Defence, S,W,1,4th November, 1952. -2-
