Ifl(TH^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL ,    ,,C.(52) 365 COPY NO.27TH OCTOBER, 1952CABINETEAST/WEST TRADE:  EXPORT OF DRUGS TO china memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the President of the Board of trade the Economic Policy Committee at their 23rd meeting on the30th July, considered a memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(E.A.(52) 102) recommending a relaxation of the controls at present exercised by the United Kingdom (but not by the other Western European countries) overthe export of certain drugs (antibiotics, antimalarials and sulphonamides) to hong Kong and China.    The facts are as set out in paragraphs 1 to 8 inclusive of that memorandum and the arguments for and against relaxation of controlwere set out in paragraphs 9 and 10.2. The Committee decided that the current policy should not be modified without a prior approach being made to the United States Government,and invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, to consider whether such an approach should be made.3. Since that time evidence has continued to come in, on the one hand of orders offered to the United Kingdom, which have had to be refused, andon the other hand of orders accepted by Continental suppliers.      The recenttrend is illustrated by the following figures of imports into Hong Kong, largelyfor re-export to China.      The total value of these imports has increased froma monthly average of  151,000 in the first six months of 1952 to  450,000 inJuly and August.     The United Kingdom share of Hong Kong&apos;s imports of thesedrugs has fallen from 22 per cent in the third quarter of 1951 to 8 per cent inJuly and August.     Conversely the share of France has increased between thesame periods from 4 per cent to 31 per cent and that of Italy from 9 per cent to 34 per cent.    The United Kingdom pharmaceutical industry, while exertingpressure on us to remove control, have up to now for the most part faithfullyobserved the spirit of our policy;  but its failure to achieve the purpose intendedis apparent and the loss of business to European competitors has been thesubject of frequent criticism, particularly as, in any case, United Kingdomdrugs can still reach China by re-export from Western European countries.Questions have already been asked in the House and our position is becoming increasingly difficult to defend.4. There are three possible courses of action:-(i)   To induce other Western European exporters of thesedrugs to accept the United King dompolicy either in the United Nations or through the Paris Group.
(ii) Action by the Hong Kong Government to limit the import of these drugs to the needs ofthe Colony and to prevent their re-export to China.(iii)   To align our policy with that of the other western european exporting countries by relaxing the United Kingdom control unless anduntil (i) has been achieved.5. Course (i).     The United Kingdom has tried, without success,to secure agreement in the Paris Group to the quantitative restrictionby all Member Governments of exports of these drugs to China.    Ourlatest proposal to this effect was rejected in July.     It is easy for thecountries, who object to the proposal, to take a firm stand on humanitarianprinciples, arguing that it is wrong to withhold drugs that can save humanlife.     There seems at present to be little hope of any change in this attitude.6. Course (ii).    Action by the Hong Kong Government could noteffectively cut off China*s imports of these drugs.    Owing to their smallbulk, it would be impossible to prevent a proportion of Hong Kong importsbeing smuggled into China;  and in any case, the control could be easilyevaded by bypassing Hong Kong.    In addition, the internal situation in hong Kong has already been seriously affected by the loss of trade due tothe China embargo.     The further loss of this traditional trade in drugswould aggravate the situation and would be strongly resented, especially since it would be recognised as ineffective.    Moreover there is always a danger of reprisals against Hong Kong by the Chinese people s Government.7. Course (iii).    Removal of the United Kingdom restrictions wouldbe open to criticism in the United States, and, to a lesser extent, in thiscountry, on the grounds that we should thereby be increasing the powersof resistance of the Communist forces, and failing in our duty to theUnited Nations troops in Korea.    In practice, however, no action we take on our own could be effective, and since there are contrary humanitarianarguments which can be advanced, such criticism might fairly be answered.8. On balance, we have come to the conclusion that (iii) is the best course.    Opinion in the United States could not be expected to reactfavourably in present circumstances to any relaxation of controls againstChina even if, as in this case, the practical effect on security would not be significant.     It would therefore be prudent to give the United States Govern-ment an opportunity to comment on the proposal to lift the United kingdom control before putting it into effect.    We suggest that, after the presidential election, the United States Government be informed that we have found thepresent United Kingdom control to be ineffective, that it cannot serve any useful purpose unless a similar control is generally applied by western european exporters, and that we propose accordingly to lift the control atthe end of November.     If, however, the United States Government desires to make a further attempt to secure the general adoption of controls similarto our own, we would be prepared to defer action in a strictly limited period(say until the 31st December) till the result of their efforts was known.9. We recommend that our colleagues should agree to authorise theForeign Secretary to inform the United States Government on the lines suggested in paragraph 8 above.A.E.27TH OCTOBER, 1952. P.T.
