Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1952SECRETCopy No.   gC. (52) 37831st October, 1952CABINETHIGHER TECHNOLOGICAL education memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i am in general agreement with the views expressed in the Memorandum(C. (52) 371) circulated by the Lord President of the Council. I am strongly ofthe opinion that, if the country is to be assured that we are really in earnest aboutdeveloping higher technological education, we cannot content ourselves merelywith a decision to build up Imperial College, no matter how spectacular thatprocess is to be. I think our credit will suffer outside London if we say merelythat Imperial College is to be built up and nothing else of any significance.2. We cannot ignore the achievements and potentialities of institutions of university rank outside London, and especially those quoted by the Lord President.They have an important contribution to make to the development we are seeking,and both the institutions themselves and the industries which benefit from theirteaching and research would be disturbed if no indication is given of the Govern-menfs attitude to them.3. I appreciate the severe limitations on the resources presently available for large-scale expansion in this field. But I believe that useful development can takeplace outside London without anything in the nature of the scale of expenditurecontemplated for Imperial College. So far as the Royal Technical College,Glasgow, at least is concerned, we need not commit ourselves at this stage to anyfurther physical expansion. The College have at present as much as they can cope with in the major  800,000 extension now in progress. What I think we must giveis a general assurance that the Imperial College project is not the only step theGovernment are prepared to take and that we are willing to consider how othercomparable institutions can play a part in promoting the development of highertechnological education throughout the country. I believe that such a course is fully justified on merits and is also desirable from the point of view of tactics.4. There is an immediate problem affecting Glasgow that of the futurerelationship of the Royal Technical College and the University. The Universityhave proposed changes in the existing scheme of affiliation which the College regard as unacceptable. The College, for their part, have suggested that they should begiven independent degree-granting powers. I should like, with the help of theChancellor of the Exchequer, to see what can be done to find a satisfactory solutionof the problem. But this will take some time and I realise that meanwhile aGovernment announcement about Imperial College cannot be delayed. I should hope, therefore, that we can decide that such an announcement should make itclear that (a) the plans contemplated for Imperial College do not constitute the onlystep we are prepared to take and that they are without prejudice to other possible developments;(b) we are conscious of the potentialities at other institutions in Scotland and elsewhere in England; and(c) we shall consider along what lines such institutions can make the fullest possible contribution to the development of higher technological education.J. S.Scottish Office, S.W.1,31st October, 1952.43149
