(THIS-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER britannic MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENSECRET / r\COPY NO. U/C.(52) 370 I28TH OCTOBER, 1952CABINETFACILITIES FOR PURCHASE OF TITS ASSETS OF THEROAD HAULAGE EXECUTIVEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Co-ordination ofTransport, Fuel and PowerFinancial assistance towards the purchase of road transport unitsor vehicles from the British Transport Commission could be provided either(i) by the granting of credit by the banks to individual purchasers or (ii) byhandling the transactions on a hire purchase basis.2. So far as (i) is concerned the Treasury see great difficulty inindicating to the banks that it would not be contrary to Government policy forthem to make direct advances to their customers for this purpose.     The banksthemselves would be willing to make a short term advance in the ordinary course of business where it was merely a question of a moderate expansionof an existing haulage business of sound financial standing.    This type of case,however, is not the one with which it is necessary to deal.3. In regard to (ii) the Treasury say that there would be grave danger in instructing the banks that there would be no Government objection to theirmaking additional credit available to existing hire purchase finance houses toenable them to give facilities to intending purchasers.     They argue that therewould be no assurance that these additional funds would be used solely for thepurpose for which the relaxation was intended.4. An examination has, therefore, been made of the possibility of creating a new hire purchase organisation to which funds could be madeavailable by the banks solely to facilitate specific transactions arising fromthe Transport Bill.    This possibility has been explored by the Road HaulageAssociation and the United Dominions Trust Ltd. , and the former have draftedArticles of Association for a new company which would offer the hire purchasefacilities,5. The intention so far is that the new company (to be sponsored by theRoad Haulage Association) should employ United Dominions Trust as itsagents, but it might be possible to employ other established finance houses ifthey were willing to participate.    The Treasury would then be prepared toinform the banks that there was no objection to funds being made available tothis new company.    It does not, however, necessarily follow that havingregard to the risks involved the banks would be willing to extend credit tothe new organisation.    The risks involved in financing transactions of thiskind must be considerable and it follows that the rates charged would inconsequence have to be high.
6. For the Government to underwrite these risks in any way would be most embarrassing from the point of view of their general financial policyand might well give rise to political difficulties.    Moreover, it would invitelaxity in the granting of credit for the transactions.7. It should be added that the use of hire purchase facilities for thispurpose would, if the terms were more favourable than those stipulated in the hire Purchase Restrictions Orders, require a licence from the Board of Trade.The grant of such a licence would raise the question of discrimination againstthe purchasers of road vehicles other than those sold by the Commission.Li.Great George Street, S.W. 1.28TH OCTOBER, 1952.
