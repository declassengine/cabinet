Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues may recollect that, in paragraph 6 of C. (52) 247 proposing thatthe base-line system of delimiting territorial waters should be applied to the UnitedKingdom, I referred to the dispute which had arisen with Iceland. The positionis that the Icelandic Government, have introduced regulations extending their,exclusive fishery limits from three to four miles and defining these limits on theshoreward side by a system of base lines enclosing substantial areas which hadbeen hitherto regarded as open sea. In particular, the base line drawn acrossFaxa Bay can hardly be considered &quot; reasonable.&quot; The effect of these regulations,which are claimed to be in the interest of conservation of the fishing grounds by the exclusion of all fishing vessels, Icelandic and foreign alike, is to exclude British trawlers from grounds which they have been accustomed to fish for over fifty years.We have protested to the Icelandic Government in two Notes on the grounds that,although this extension of limits may be partially justified in. the light of the recentHague Court Judgement in the Anglo-Norwegian fisheries dispute, it in fact goesbeyond the principles approved by the Court, is contrary to international law and ought not, in any case, to have been taken without consultation between the interests concerned.2. The British trawler owners have retaliated by refusing necessary facilities to Icelandic trawlers calling at Hull and Grimsby and thus preventing them fromlanding their fish. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have attempted,without success, to dissuade the trawler owners from imposing this ban, and itis their considered view that there should now be no question of urging the Britishtrawler owners to relax their ban without some concession on Iceland&apos;s part. they believe that the trawler owners would be prepared to accept the Four-Mile limit on the North coast provided that they could have some concessions on the south coast. In that case they might also accept exclusion from Faxa Bay, an area inwhich they were previously permitted to fish but which is now closed to them.The ban has meanwhile had the effect of causing the Icelandic Government to reply to our last Note of 18th June in a Note which was published on 17th october and in which they claim that they were acting within their rights and complainabout the proposed ban. In addition, Icelandic firms have warned United kingdom firms that, if the ban on the landing of fish from Iceland in United Kingdom portspersists, they will be unable to continue to place orders in the United Kingdom.3. I am concerned at the development of this dispute, which is likely to leadto criticism in Parliament on the grounds that Her Majesty&apos;s Government have failed to protect an important British interest and that prolongation of the disputemay lead to a rise in the price of fish. Furthermore, if an early solution is not found, a serious international dispute may develop, leading to difficulties with our allies in the Council of Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.4. The Board of Trade have stated that the balance of trade with Icelandis already heavily in our favour and from that point of view any restrictions onour exports to Iceland would not have very serious results. But at the least thesituation must cause inconvenience to a good many exporters.   The Ministry ofPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1952CONFIDENTIALCopy No.C.

Food, for their part, are concerned at the loss of Icelandic-caught fish at a timewhen it is needed to supplement supplies landed by British trawlers and at thepossibility that prices may rise steeply in consequence and provoke demands forpride control. l^iT&apos;&apos;&quot; :K n-Ti-irv ;5.   It seems to me clear:  &quot;(a) that a continuation of the present exchanges with the Icelandic Govern -ment will get us nowhere; and ,l -(b) that there is no means of compelling the British trawler owners to lift theban, referred to above, so long as they keep within the law, as theyhave done.6. I consider that the least unfavourable solution to this problem would befor the fishing interests of the two countries to hold direct discussions in whichthe British fishing interests would inform the Icelanders what were the minimumconcessions (as to which see paragraph 2 above) they Would seek before raising the ban on the landings from Icelandic vessels. The Icelanders would then beinvited to discuss these possible concessions with their Government and my hope,admittedly not a strong one, is that they would influence the latter. In suggestingto the Icelandic Government that such discussions should take place, my ideawould be to say that I hoped that the British interests would be able in the courseof them to explain their point of view in a way which would convince the Icelandicinterests that a reasonable basis for practical adjustment existed. Such discussionsmight lead on, either to the appointment of a commission of officials, trawler owners and scientists from both sides to examine the problem of fish conservation (onthe need for which the Icelandic case is primarily founded) and make recommen-dations to the two Governments, or to a study of the problem under the  egis ofthe Permanent Commission which is expected to come into being next year underthe Overfishing Convention.7. I should also like to explore whether some means can be found to make clear beyond doubt that, as the Icelandic Government claim, their own fishermenare being excluded from the disputed waters, and will continue to be excludedequally with British vessels, so long as the regulations remain in force. The Britishinterests apparently doubt if this will be done, and proof of it would help to create a better atmosphere for the discussions suggested in paragraph 6 above.8. I recommend to my colleagues that I should be authorised to proceed on the. lines indicated in paragraphs 6 and 7 above.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,23rd October, 1952.
