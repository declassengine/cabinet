(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (52) 3853RD NOVEMBER, 1952CABINETCOPY NO.INVESTMENT IN 1953RECONSTRUCTION OF BLITZED CITY CENTRESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the building work requiring to be done in the blitzed cities is thebuilding of shops and offices.    In the main it is a matter of allowing bigconcerns like Woolworths, Marks &amp; Spencers and Ravensefts to put up large buildings.     From the point of view of the national interest this work is farfrom essential.2. The Investment Programme was fixed at  3 millions for 1952.The Minister&apos;s paper shows that he expects to do  4.5 millions of work. 300,000 of the difference between the two figures represents work whichI agreed to because steel was already available on sites.      3. 3 millions would have been enough to deal with practically all the work which was already in progress.    An additional  1.2 million over and above what v/as approved is being done on work started in 1952, and it is the carry-over fromthis which will reduce the amount which can be started in 1953 to thei.j million of which the Minister of Housing complains.3. My reasons for considering that the programme should be held at 2. 5 millions are as follows:-(1)  We deliberately decided to make reductions all round inorder to allow the housing programme to proceed andto give more building resources to manufacturing industry.(2)  If building resources are available in the blitzed townsthey should be diverted to other more essentialpurposes within the main programme, in the same area.     Next year&apos;s building programme required a9f per cent increase in the output of building workof all kinds as compared with 1951, and a 10 per cent increase in new building work as compared with the1952 programme.     The first six months of this yearshow an average increase of less than 1 per cent in total output.(3)  It would obviously be wrong to restrict  import investment in manufacturing industry, and by the nationalised industries, and build offices and shops instead.
(4)  I am advised that most of these buildings requireconsiderable building steel.    If the Minister haspersuaded some authorities to use less steel, the steel saved should be used for other purposes suchas shipbuilding.     We are importing 2 million tonsof steel this year, nearly half of it for dollars.Next year we shall still be importing on asubstantial scale.     We cannot afford to importsteel for inessential investment purposes.(5)  We cannot have an unlimited building programme.If we have it, resources will be sucked intobuilding which ought to be devoted to other activities.     The whole object of our monetary policy is to create sufficient ease in the economy to move resources to the most essential require-ments.     Already we have got more men in thecoal mines, on the railways and in engineering.We must not fritter this away by further concessions,(6)  With a programme of  2. 5 millions,   j million of workcan be done on projects started in 1953.    This couldbe spread over a fair number of projects starting inthe second half of the year, the total value of whichmight be  1 million or more.4. The Minister says that there is sufficient building labour availablein these cities to do the additional work which he proposes.    I understand from the Ministry of Labour that, although the total of unemployed building workers is rather higher in the main blitzed cities than a year ago, thefollowing table shows the average number of building craftsmen unemployedduring July to September, 1952, in each of the six most important blitzedcities.    It also shows the number of unfilled vacancies for building craftsmenwhich in most cases substantially exceeds the number unemployed:-UnfilledUnemployed VacanciesBristol                          28 116Hull                               21 35Plymouth                    .39 31Sheffield                      54 164Southampton                 23 67Swansea                        12 52Together with Coventry these six cities account for about three-quarters of the investme- t in blitzed cities.    This situation does not suggest thatthere is any appreciable slack in the building industry in these cities, andallows nothing for the expansion of other kinds of building work in these areas in 1953, though the programme we have approved will clearly requireexpansion.5. In my view, we shall in any case be doing under the 1953 programme as much building work as the economy can stand if we were to maintain ourinternal financial policy.     If it turns out that under this programme there isnot enough work in particular localities and there is clear evidence thatabnormal unemployment of building workers is likely,, I should be willing
to agree to ad hoc additions to the programme on a local basis.    arrangements are being made for officials to prepare supporting programmes of this kind for those areas which the Ministry of Works consider are most likely to beinadequately employed.    These will be held in reserve until it is clear thata situation requiring their use arises, but will be available for speedyintroduction if necessary.    In my view the blitzed city work should not beincreased above  2. 5 millions in the 1953 programme or be given a priorityclaim to any spare resources in the areas in question.    But it should, ofcourse, benefit together with other kinds of work as and when the situationin any particular area is shown to justify the introduction of more work.This means some uncertainty about the total of blitzed city work which can bedone in 1953, but it is right that the risk should be taken by the less essentialkinds of building work.6. If the Minister must make an announcement in the House of Commons,I think that he should say that more important kinds of building must have prior claim.    As regards steel, could it not be said that although the steelsituation is easing, we are still importing large quantities of steel and expect to have to import next year.     The additional supplies of steel must go first to essential requirements such as exports, shipbuilding and defence.    So faras more building steel is available it must go to increase industrial building.In these conditions building in the blitzed cities must continue to be restricted.    It can be pointed out that the Labour Government did only 8 millions worth of work in these cities in three years.     We do not expect to do worse than they did.7. Looking at this merely from a political point of view, we are far more likely to be injured by those who say that we have cut, e. g. factory building, than by local complaints in the blitzed cities.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.3RD NOVEMBER, 1952.
