oCONFIDENTIALC. (52) 35823rd OCTOBER, 1952.COPY nc.( 0iabinetCORONATION ARRANGEMENTS.Memorandum by the Minister of Works.At the Cabinet meeting on 21st October (C.C.(52) 87th Conclusions,Minute 7) I was invited to circulate a paper setting out the arguments for and against certain aspects of the coronation which are the subject of public criticism.1.    The Date:   Tuesday, 2nd June, 1953.The Home Secretary in his paper C, (52) 102, gave the reasons forrecommending a date between 29th May and 6th June.(a) Whit Monday falls on 25th May.   It was thought impossible to havethe Coronation before that date owing to the Local government elections.(b) It was thought unwise to have the Coronation in Whitsun weeksince two Bank holidays in one week would disrupt production over the whole week.The Queen selected Tuesday, 2nd June, which is the earliest practicable day after Whitsun week.The London Press criticised the choice of date on the grounds that the hotels are always full in Derby week.   This commercial complainthas subsided.It was also said that trees in full leaf would interfere with theview of the Procession.   There is not much in this.   The view from somebuildings in Park Lane will not be so good.   The view from the stands in the mall will be better than in 1937.   The greenery will put life into the decorationsalong the route.The date, having been decided, cannot now be altered.2,    The RouteThe Route was recommended to The Queen by the Earl Marshalafter consultation with myself and others, and approval by the Coronation JointCommittee and by the Coronation Commission.As compared with 1937 the changes made will add splendour .to the Procession.   On the return journey Her Majesty is to proceed by way ofWhitehall and a fine climax is reached in the last stage from Admiralty Arch
to Buckingham Palace.   The Coronation films will gain a great deal by including Whitehall and the Mall on the return route.   But these improvementslengthened the route considerably.   In compensation we therefore recommendedthat what might be described as the Embankment loop should be given up.   Lasttime the Procession turned out of Parliament Square into Bridge Street, turnedleft along the embankment and up Northumberland Avenue.   The mainadvantage of this loop lay in the standing-room on the embankment where, atthe request of His Late Majesty, some 37,000 L.C.C. schoolchildren hadreserved places.   The scene was also enlivened by a number of shipsmoored alongside and used as stands.The L.C.C. are pressing me for places for their schoolchildren,A refusal might be awkward. But I could only provide the space asked for bydepriving the general public of pavements they are accustomed to occupy.Taking the arguments for and against the route which has been selected, I submit that -(a) The Queen should not be asked to increase the return route.It is longer than in 1937 and it would be a real loss togive up the chance of taking the film in Whitehall and the Mall;(b) The Queen might possibly consent to lengthen the route to^ theAbbey by crossing Trafalgar Square to Northumberland Avenue,turning right along the Embankment and entering parliament square by Bridge Street.   The children could then see Her majesty in the morning, and get away reasonably early.   The commissioner of the Metropolitan Police recommended this when the route was first discussed.3.    StandsIt is said -(a) that we are not building enough stands in fact we hope to provide somewhat over 100,000 seats,at least 5,000 more than last time.   The Government can onlybuild in the Royal Parks and on land that belongs to the Grown.   Iam satisfied we should not build any more stands on the route asat present decided.The number of seats in windows and in private stands exceeds the number provided by the Government, but less of these are forsale than in 1937 and the ticket agencies have more enquiries.Hence the squeals.(b) that not enough is being done for those who cannot afford seatsI propose to do something new to meet this criticism byconstructing shallow platforms in Hyde Park and the Mall which willprovide excellent stand-room for 25,000 additional persons.   Detailsof cost will be submitted to the Cabinet Committee on CoronationPreparations.
(c) that our prices will be too highWe decided, I am sure rightly, that this time the general body of taxpayers should not subsidise those who get a Governmentseat, especially as in the open market our seats would fetchmuch more than the  6 for covered and  4 for uncovered which arethe prices we propose to charge.   On the tenders so far receivedtheseprices will barely cover the cost, but I do not think we should go higher.   Indeed the High Commissioners have asked that we should keep to the original estimate of  5, 10s. and  3. 10s. and I amreporting on this to the Cabinet Committee on Coronation Preparationsa(d) that our method of allocating Government seats creates a privilegedclass of spectators.About 40% of the seats on Government stands will be allocated to overseas members of the Commonwealth, the Colonies and diplomatic Corps.   The United Kingdom quota will be distributed among the various Crown Services and to national associationsrepresenting different aspects of national life.   The distributionwill give a smaller proportion than in 1937 to Servants of theCrown.   The Civil Service will have about half their 1937allocation.   On the other hand there will be a substantial increase for Women&apos;s organisations.4.    press the press and cameramen were nervous that they would nothave the opportunities to report and photograph the procession which they want,   I have promised them better facilities than ever before on such occasions and the Coronation Joint Committee has agreed to allocate1,000 seats to the press as compared with 700 in 1937,5.    Television in the AbbeyThis question is being dealt with by a Cabinet Committee,6.    The Earl MarshalThe Duke of Norfolk is being attacked most unfairly,D.E.Ministry of Works, S.E.1.23rd October, 1952.
