Printed for the Cabinet,   November 1952CONFIDENTIALC. (52) 3956th November, 1952CABINETANZUS AND THE UNITED kingdom note by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues may be interested to read the attached letter from the Ministerof State recording his conversations in New York with the Australian and NewZealand Ministers of External Affairs and the United States Secretary of Stateabout the ANZUS Pact.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,6th November, 1952.It has been impossible for me to avoid some discussion on ANZUS. Caseyconstantly reverts to it, Webb has mentioned it more than once and Acheson hasdiscussed it once. I have endeavoured to avoid any argument, on the ground thatyou would be talking to them about it when you came, preparatory to the discus-sions during the Commonwealth Conference in London. I have, however,mentioned the following points:  (1) Our exclusion was felt to impair our Commonwealth ties with Australiaand New Zealand and also to impair our relations with the UnitedStates.(2) We are in a completely different position from France and the Philippinesin the Pacific. We will go to war if Australia and New Zealand areattacked, whereas neither France nor the Philippines would necessarilydo so.(3) We are a great naval power with possessions in the Pacific and have a greatdeal to contribute.(4) Any defence planning nowadays must be affected by global considerations.In the Atlantic the United States plan with us within North atlantic treaty Organisation. In the Middle East, we hope to have an organi-sation in which the United States, Australia and New Zealand will planwith us. Any South-East Asian planning obviously involves the four of us. Therefore, it seemed to me illogical that we should be excludedfrom defence planning in the Pacific. Of course, we knew that theywould tell us what they had planned after they had planned it, butthat was quite different from us being in on the planning.I want to make it quite clear that I have not put forward these ideas as if theywere the official presentation of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments case, but merely the Way in which I myself see the matter.Casey is obviously much worried, and says that this controversy is more dangerous to relations between Australia and the United Kingdom than any otherthat he has known.The history of the matter, according to him, is that when in January 1950the need for a Pacific Pact was first mooted by Australia at the Colombo Confer-ence, no support was given by the United Kingdom.  Throughout 1950 AustraliaCopy No. 6 743179
on a number of occasions reverted to the idea. Neither the United States northe United Kingdom gave any support. In the autumn of 1950 Australia made it clear to the United States that she would not sign the Japanese Peace Treatyunless she was given a guarantee ^gainst possible future aggression.The United States Government tpn began to consider some arrangement to which the United Kingdom would &quot;be a partner. Mr. Dulles came to Tokyoto discuss it. The United Kingdom Government refused to have any part; there-fore the idea of a pact limited to the United States, Australia and New Zealandwas put forward at Canberra by Mr. Dulles. From February to September 1951the United Kingdom Government were kept informed of the negotiations and at no time suggested that the United Kingdom should become a party. Caseyadded that in his view the United Kingdom Government were perfectly correctin that attitude. It was not necessary for all the members of the commonwealth to be parties to all the treaties made by other members. He said that he couldnot understand the United Kingdom attitude and why we were &quot; making a fuss.&quot;No one was keener than he upon the Empire and it was wounding to be accused of being lukewarm towards the British connection.He further said that this treaty was essential for Australian security. It helped the United Kingdom because it relieved them of anxiety in the Pacific. If therewas a war, it was unlikely that we would be able to send forces to the Pacific.It was geographically more appropriate that the Far East should be a United Statesresponsibility.If the United Kingdom persisted in its present actions the consequences wouldbe either that the treaty would become a dead letter or that the United states would withdraw altogether. Australia could not afford to allow either of thesecontingencies to arise. The United States were determined not to have the UnitedKingdom in as observers, because they have been told that if they did, Franceand the Philippines would at once request similar status. The United States feltthat if the United Kingdom came in, it was impossible to stop France and the philippines. Under no circumstances would the United States have either france or the Philippines present at any realistic military discussions. Therefore theUnited States must refuse our request.Casey thought that the United States were correct in this attitude because for security reasons it was impossible to have military talks of any value with the Frenchand Philippines present. If the United Kingdom attended without the Philippines,it would be represented as a white man&apos;s pact, i.e., a pact with a colour bar.Webb has been much less definite about the matter. As you know, hecombines the Ministry of External Affairs with the Ministry for Island territories and the Attorney-Generalship. I would guess that up to now, his other respon-sibilities have taken up most of his time. His attitude, putting it crudely, is that new Zealand is very sorry that there should be this trouble between friends. he regards ANZUS not as a substitute in any way for the Commonwealth Association,but simply as complementary to it.Acheson wants us to appreciate the difficulty of his position vis-a-vis the Frenchand the Philippines. He said that in his view both the French cyphers and theQuai d&apos;Orsay were hopelessly insecure and therefore realistic military planningcould not. take place at present. So far as the Philippines were concerned theyhad objected strongly to their exclusion from ANZUS and had only been placatedon the ground that the United Kingdom and France were also excluded. then there were the recent Five-Power (ANZUS plus United Kingdom and France)discussions on South-East Asian defence. When that was announced, Romulo, ofthe Philippines, had come to Acheson&apos;s office and had wept and said that no government friendly to the West could now survive in the Philippines. Achesonfelt that if the United Kingdom came in any capacity to the ANZUS meetings itwould seriously weaken the position of the present Philippines Government andturn the Asians even more against the United States.   He just could not do it.It may be that what is really worrying the Americans is the feeling that our participation will imply their automatic involvement in South-East Asia, but that point has not been stressed to me. In fact, Casey has said that Admiral Radfordis all the time telling the United States authorities that any Pacific planning whichdoes not include South-East Asia is a waste of time.
