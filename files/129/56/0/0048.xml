confidential.(52) 398 COPY NO7TH NOVEMBER, 1952CABINETCHRISTMAS FOOD BONUSESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at their meeting on 29th October, the Cabinet invited me to discuss with the Minister of Food the possibility of issuing special food bonuses at christmas (C.C.(52) 91st Conclusions, Minute 5).     The idea was that, if this could be arranged, they should be announced at the same time as the adjust-ments in the rations of meat, butter, margarine and cheese.Two possibilities were mentioned in the Minister of Food&apos;s paper(C.(52) 361)    a bonus issue of sugar and a month&apos;s postponement of thereduction in the margarine ration.I have discussed both possibilities with the Minister of Food.    Weare agreed:-(1)   That it would be wrong to spend  1 million in dollars on asugar bonus.     With the extra bonus which was given tohelp the plum growers this summer, domestic consumption in 1952 will have been only 3 lbs.per head short of the peak level reached in 1951.*and above that in any other post-war year except1949.    The issue this Christmas of a sugar bonus,which would be a pure luxury since it would not be related to any specific purpose such as the making of jam, might well give a misleading impressionabout the extent of the improvement in our economic position.(2)   That it would equally be wrong to make additional dollarpurchases of oils and fats in order to postpone thereduction in the margarine ration.     The raising ofthe butter ration will be welcomed by the general public, even though it is accompanied by a fall inthe margarine ration.We are, therefore, agreed that, bearing in mind our balance of payments position, we should not make provision for any Christmas bonuses this yeareR.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.
