IfPERSIAUNITED STATES IDEAS FOR A SETTLEMENT of the OIL dispute memorandum by the Secretary of Statefog Foreign AffairsThe Americans are convinced that the joint proposals of30th August are deado   Mr. Musaddiq, they say, has finallyrejected them, and there is no chance of any Persian Governmentwhich might come to power in foreseeable circumstances beingwilling to accept them.   They were deeply disturbed at theprospect of diplomatic relations between Persia and theUnited Kingdom being broken off and they are afraid, asalways, that unless the oil dispute is somehow solved, Persiav/ill be lost to the free world.    They are therefore trying to persuade us to work: out jointly with them some fresh approach to Dr. Musaddiq.2.     During the past few days there have been detailed discussions of the problem between Departments concerned andthe Anglo Iranian Oil Company on the one hand and Mr. Nitze,head of the State Department Policy Planning Staff, andMr. Levy, an independent oil consultant who advised Mr. Harrimanin Tehran, on the other.   Mr. Nitze has been at pains toexplain that ho has not come to put a plan to us, and that hisobject is only to see whether we and he can jointly producesome ideas which will preserve our own interests and be acceptable to Persia.    In fact, he and Mr* Levy have put forwardvarious alternatives which have one outstanding feature in common, namely the abandonment of the principle that compensation should be determined by impartial adjudicationand the substitution of an arrangement whereby the parties should agree directly how compensation should be fixed and howit should be paid in oils   See Annex03.     Acceptance of the American ideas in any of their various forms would have serious effects of which the following arethe most important:-(a) We should be abandoning a clear intelligibleprinciple, namely that compensation should be decided byimpartial adjudication, and could not return to it.    Insteadwe should be committed to negotiating direct with Dr. Musaddiq.There are so many variable factors in the proposals that wewould be under pressure from both Persians and Americans tomake concessions without having any firm ground of principle on which to stand.(b) The compensation element in the American ideas(from 30 to 50 million tons, say  150 million to  250 million)represents at the most something less than two years&apos; output from Persia at the.rate obtaining when the Anglo Iranian oil company left Abadan.    To establish the principle that a foreign country can expropriate a foreign concessionaire at the costof less than two years&apos; production would have incalculablerepercussions on our foreign oil and other investments.&quot;II &quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;W secret (52) 35U COPY NO.

(c) Anything that might be described as more favourableterras to Persia will undermine oar other concessions, manyof which have most favoured nation clauses.(d) The Anglo Iranian Oil Comany would be under atleast a moral obligation to buy and find markets for Persia&apos;soil over and above what they received by way of compensation.In addition to compromising on the principle of compensation,the Company would be required to pledge one of its greatestassets, namely its world-wide marketing organisation, inreturn for a sales arrangement which would involve no practical guarantees even if the Persian Government were disposed for their part to carry it out.(e) The price formulae in the United States proposalsappear to square with the fifty:fifty principle but theyare in fact quite unrealistic.    If they were adopted therewould be a very considerable departure from the fifty:fifty-principle, the value of which as a general regulator forMiddle East oil agreements would therefore be seriouslyundermined.   The effect might also be to drive down the priceof Persian Gulf oil, which would be contrary to the interestsboth of the British companies and of Her Majesty1s Government.(f) Any arrangement which involved taking considerable quantities of oil from Persia, particularly crude oil, wouldprobably mean some cutting back of production in other middle east countries such as Iraq and Kuwait.   This would presenta problem not only in terms of oil relations but also from thepolitical and financial point of view.h.     These considerations lead to the conclusion that we couldnot accept any of the American schemes without seriouslyjeopardising our interests in Persia and elsewhere.    the americans admit the drawbacks in their proposals, but believethat, contrary to our view, it is now in our own interest toaccept a bad agreement rather than have no agreement.    They argue(i)    that unless the oil dispute is settled soon, Persia will go communist;   and(ii)    that there is an increasing risk, in the absenceof an agreement, that Persia will soon be selling oilat cut-throat prices, thus undermining the world oilprice structure, with resultant damage to our balanceof payments.   In their view this could be more damaging than any repercussions of a bad agreement inother concession countries.We do not accept either of these assumptions as warranting abad agreement.   We believe that the danger of communism in persia is less than the Americans fear and that in any case itwill not be exercised by surrender to blackmail or by the mereinjection of financial aid or revenues through oil.   As regards(ii), the British oil companies would prefer to face adisturbance in the world price structure, which is likely to occur anyhow but may only be temporary, rather than deliberatelycourt permanent trouble with their concessions elsewhere.5.     The American Ambassador, who has hitherto agreed with ourwaiting policy and criticised the nervous impatience of theState Department, has recently warned us that Persia willbecome a burning issue in the U.S.A, between now and 1+th NovemberH.M. Ambassador at Washington sees no sign of this at present,but the latest American move is no doubt dictated largely by internal political considerations, and we must be prepared tosee the United States openly breaking the common front in persia by some spectacular and unpleasant action on their own.The results of this breach would immediately make themselvesfelt throughout the Middle East and indeed further afield.
We must do everything possible to prevent matters ooming tothis pass.   We must therefore try to convince the americans that it is not hopeless to stand on the -joint proposals.We should show that we understand their pre-occupations and produce convincing arguments to meet them.6.     The discussions with Mr* Nitze show clearly that theAmericans1 main worries over the joint proposals relate to:-; vv-;, (a)    the prospects of bringing Persia to acceptarbitration as compensation;   and(b)   whether Persia will be able to sell oil soon enoughand in sufficient quantities to bring about a degree of   &apos;economic and political stability.7.     As regards (a), Persians of all opinions appear   ,seriously to fear that arbitration would result&apos; in an awardso large as to cripple Persia&apos;s economy for an indefinitenumber of years.     We cannot, of course, compromise our right to claim compensation in full for the loss of the1933 Concession Agreement, hut we could reasonahly take theline with the Americans that the International Court or anyarbitral tribunal would he unlikely to make an award whichwas manifestly beyond Persia&apos;s power to pay.     We recognise(so the argument would run) that it would be out of thequestion for Persia to pay compensation by means of a lump sum cash payment.     Compensation would almost certainly haveto be payable over a period of years*     We might howeversuggest that though we would claim compensation in full, theCourt might well, as in the case of Mexico, give an awardwhich was not specifically related either to the loss of assets or to the loss of future profits and which it wouldbe within Persia&apos;s power to pay.     Again, we might suggestthat by the time the award was made (by which time thepolitical atmosphere would have no doubt considerably improved)it might he possible to adjust the manner of payment to persia&apos;s ability to pay.     We could also make more of thepoint in our note of the lU/th October that the Court would decide whether and to what extent a claim to compensationfor tho unilatoral cancellation of the 1933 ConcessionAgreement was justified, and Her Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe bound by the Court1s decision.     We could refuteDr. Musaddiq&apos;s statement that there are no precedents fora claim for loss of profits by pointing to the United Kingdomaward on the Nationalisation of the Coal Mines..     If the americans found these arguments attractive, we would have toconsider carefully how they could he put to the Persianswithout prejudice to the arbitration proceedings.8.     As regards (h), the Americans are looking for some means of giving Persia quick financial aid and fear that  /hen the Anglo Iranian Oil Company come to negotiate with the persians under the joint proposals there will be interminahlewrangles over purchase and price.     We should, therefore,encourage the United States Government to increasesubstantially the sum of money which they offered under thejoint proposals and regard this as pre-paymeht for oil to hedelivered under the Defence Materials Production Act.(Such purchase and pre-payment is in fact suggested byMr. Nitze as part of his scheme...)     We should also tell themthat the Anglo Iranian Oil Company would have an interestonce agreement had been reached on the question ofcompensation, in ensuring that Persia was in a position topay compensation.     It could, therefore, he expected to makea reasonahle effort to find markets for Persian oil.     Atthe same time there would he no objection to an arrangementinvolving other companies, which would result in greaterquantities of oil being sold.     This could be done by forming
an international group including the AngloIffo.Di.cm Oil Compare, and other &quot;big oil companies,although this would raise difficulties in respectof the American anti-trust proceedings.     It might also heobjectionable to Dr. Musaddiq, who wishes to be able tosell his oil free to individual customers.     An alternativepossibility would he for one of the other big oil companies,,acting independently but in agreement with the Anglo iranian oil Company, to help to increase Persia&apos;s output and take any oil which the Anglo Iranian Oil Company did not require.9o      If these arguments failed to convince the Americans, weshould have to balance the risk of standing firm on thejoint proposals and facing a serious and visible breach withthe United States against the risk of maintaining the common front at the expense of our oil and other financial interests.A possible way out of the dilemma might be to tell the americans that we understand their difficulties and to suggestthat if they consider it necessary to bale out Dr. Musaddiqwe should expect them at least to do so in a way which didnot directly damage our oil and other financial Interests.This would mean their giving direct aid to Dr. Musaddiqwithout tying the grant in any way to an oil settlement.Such aid need not suggest that we and the United states were at variance;    on the contrary, we could show that wewere in agreement.     The United States Government would nodcubt find this highly inconvenient from the Constitutionalpoint of view, but we could put it to them that it mightbe preferable for them to find a solution along these linesrather than openly to run counter to the wishes of an ally.108    Until a decision can be taken on the balance of risk,jreferred to in paragraph 9 above, it seems most important that the Americans should not mention their present schemes to the Persians and thejr certainly should not allow aparticular figure for compensation to obtain currencypublicly to privately.     Any mention of a figure would prejudice the Anlgo Iranian Oil Company&apos;s claim at arbitration.A small figure would be difficult to defend to their share-holders;    a large figure would tend to frighten the Persiansand possibly might be difficult to defend before public opinion.The Company are understandably reluctant to mention a figureat this stage.11o    Mr. Nitze, who has come over as Mr. Acheson&apos;s special representative, will obviously hope to take hack somethingpositive from his discussions with us.     We cannot give himour consent to proposals of the kind which he has adumbrated,but it may help if we tell him that we are ready to continue,either here or in Washington, to explore the ideas set out inparagraphs 7 and 8 above.      This should at least help the americans to understand that our unwillingness to respond to their proposals does not imply lack of a policy or anunwillingness to face facts,12.    I invite my colleagues to agree that(i)    we should stand by the joint proposalsof 30th August;(ii)    we should continue our own efforts(now limited to indirect means) to persuade the Persians to accept them;
(lit)    we should continue exploratory talks with the Americans with the objectof persuading them that providedwe &quot;both stpnd together and if wedevelop the joint proposals on thelines indicated in paragraphs and 8 above these proposals stilloffer our best chance of securing an acceptahle settlement with Persia.Foreign Office, S.W.1.23RD OCTOBER,  1952.
1CMANNEXMAIN FEATURES Off THE SCHEMES ADUMBRATEDBY THE AMERICANS(l)   Lump sum compensation to the Company, payable in oil;    30 million tons (or 50 million tons) of crude oiland products, to be delivered over a period of, say, 6 to10 years at a rate of 5 million tons a year.    The approximatevalue of these tonnages of oil is  150 million and 250 million.(2.)   In addition, an agreement between the distributingagency (which might be the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company) andthe National Iranian Oil Company for the purchase of between15 and 20 million tons of oil and oil products per annum for 10 or 15 years.(3)   A loan by the United States Government to thedistributing agency&apos; of up to 100 million dollars as an advance payment to the National Iranian Oil Company against future purchase of oil.    This advance could be, in part,repayable by the delivery of aviation spirit and perhapssome crude oil and other products to the United StatesGovernment.
