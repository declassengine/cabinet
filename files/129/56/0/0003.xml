CONFIDENTIAL Copy Nto.     8C. (52) 35321st October, 1952CABINETTHE CORONATION: ALLOCATION OF SEATS in westminster ABBEYNote by the Prime minister circulate for the consideration of my colleagues a minute from the earl marshal in which he seeks guidance on proposals which have been made forallocating seats in Westminster Abbey at the Coronation.w. s. c.10 Ppwning Street, S.W. 1,21st October, 1952.43071BPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1952
Prime Minister,Since my talk with you on this subject 1 have&apos;&apos; Consulted the Lord Chancellor,the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and the Permanent Secretaryto the Treasury, and I have again had regard to the views of the Sub-Committeeof the.Coronation Joint Committee which I set up to consider the problem.The Committees have considered the claims by other Member countries of theCommonwealth and, although the figures shown in Appendix I will not entirelysatisfy these demands, it is thought that they will probably be accepted; theCommittees have also borne in mind the need for increased representation of theTrade Unions. On the other hand, the Committees have scrutinised with thegreatest care the allocations to every category to see what reductions can be recommended, due regard being paid to practice and tradition and to present-daycircumstances. Substantial reductions have already been made in the quotas forthe Crown Services and in the Foreign Office list as compared with the numbers which would have been made available had the proportions of .1937 been adhered to. Some other categories have been substantially reduced and the Baronets, forinstance, have, as such, been reduced to one.You will see that, nevertheless, some 690 places are now required if thedemands, which come mainly from the other Member countries of the Common-wealth as well as in respect of Trade Unions, are to be complied with. TheCommittees have been driven to the conclusion that the only way these seats canequitably be found is by reduction in the very large quotas put aside for the Houseof Lords (1,300) and the House of Commons (920). The 690 places required couldbe obtained if the House of Lords would relinquish 420 and the House ofCommons 270 of the quotas shown in column B, so that the total of places available,including wives, would be, for the House of Lords 880, and the House ofCommons 650. , Ttus domestic problem is unsuitable for discussion by the coronation Joint Committee or the Coronation Commission and it is suggested thatyou may take the view that the matter should be considered at an early date by the Cabinet.I attach in Appendix II a note by the Lord Chancellor [and Garter] on theposition of Peers and Peeresses in this matter. I take the view that, in modern conditions and having regard to the heavy claims from other quarters, it would bedesirable to consider reducing.the numbers of Lords and Commons who would be present in the Abbey. If this view is accepted, I suggest that the only way in whichit can be achieved is by ballot. &apos;        &apos; : &apos; &apos;&apos; &apos;;There are certain categories which should, in my view, be exempt from the ballot.  I suggest that the following arrangements should be considered.House of LordsPeers who are Ministers of the Crown (whether Privy Councillors or not), orPrivy Councillors of the United Kingdom, Peers who have to participate in theProcessions in the Abbey, or Peers who are K.G.&apos;s, K.P.&apos;s, K.T.&apos;s, G.C.B.&apos;s toG.B.E.&apos;s or O.M.&apos;s, would be exempt from the ballot and would be given forth with the opportunity to receive a Summons. The remainder might be invited to ballotfor the seats remaining. Whether Peers of Ireland or Scotland who are notRepresentative Peers should be excluded would be a matter for consideration bythe authorities of the House of Lords. A Peer exempt from ballot as described above, or who finds a place by ballot, would be permitted to be accompanied either by the Peeress, if any, or the Dowager Peeress, but not both. A wife or mother ofa Peer would not be permitted to attend unless accompanying the Peer. Peeressesin their own right would be included in the scheme and in the ballot in the same way as Peers and a Summons to a Peeress in her own right would include her husband.In this, way I think a satisfactory scheme could be Operated which would reduce, to 880, the total of seats which would be required for Peers and Peeressesto be Summoned.House of CommonsMembers of the House of Commons who are Ministers of the Crown (whetherPrivy Councillors or not), or are Privy Councillors of the United Kingdom, and members of the House of Commons who have to participate in the Processions in
HIthe Abbey, would be exempt from the ballot and would be invited forthwith. (Theonly M.P.&apos;s who hold Honours betweqnthe K..G. and G.B.E. or O.M. would, Ithink, be included under categories&apos; already mentioned and that is why I have not specifically included them here.), The remainder would ballot. An M.P. exempt from ballot, or who finds a place as a result of the ballot, would be permitted tobring his wife with him. A wife of a Member would not be permitted to attend,without her husband. A woman M.P. successful in the ballot or exempt from the ballot would be permitted to bring her husband.A plan on this basis could, I consider, well be instituted, which would reducethe quota for the House of Commons to 650 in all.It will be necessary to decide, for both the House of Lords and the House ofCommons, whether exemption from ballot suggested for Ministers of the Grownshould apply to all Ministers, including junior Ministers, or whether it should apply only to Her Majesty&apos;s Chief Officers of State.I shall be glad to learn whether these proposals are approved generally and tohave directions on the point relating to Ministers. The need for an announcementis now becoming urgent, partly because of the robe difficulty.NORFOLK.17th October, 1952.43071b 2

. -APPENDIX IIPeers at the Coronation service the question on which I ani asked to advise is! Whether it would be uncbnsti-tutional if all peers did not receive a summons to attend the Coronation. In myopinion it would not. And this I say although it i has been the customary usagefor them to receive such a summons and although this usage is sometimes referredto as if it were a right. For the usage and the right are in my opinion subject tothe Royal pleasure.The attendance of peers at the Coronation has been secured in the followingmanner. First a notice is inserted by Royal Command in the Gazette by the earl marshal, calling upon peers who &quot;. . . . are entitled to assist at the solemnity ofHer Majesty&apos;s Coronation,&quot; and dowager peeresses and peeresses &quot; who desire toattend &quot; to send in their names so that Letters of Summons may be issued to them.It may be noted that in 1838, 1901 and 1910 the notice in the Gazette was addressedto dowager peeresses and peeresses &quot; who may claim to attend.&quot;Next a Letter of Summons, which is under the Sign Manual, is sent to thosewho have sent in their names commanding the recipient in peremptory terms, &quot; allexcuses set apart, that you may make your personal attendance on us . . . . thereto do and perform such services as shall be required and belong unto you.&quot;Since the Letters of Summons are preceded, by the notice in the Gazette, nosummons is sent to a peer or peeress who does not claim one; but if it happensthat a peer or peeress who has received a summons is subsequently unable, perhapsthrough illness, to attend, they may be granted Letters of Dispensation if they apply for them. Presumably the purpose of applying for such Letters is to ensure thata peer shall lose nothing by being remiss in his duty.The fact that the Lords Spiritual and Temporal have always attended the coronation Service, supported by the terms of these documents may suggest theexistence of something in the nature of a right. But I think that this is a miscon-ception. The right of a peer to be summoned to Parliament was established in the14th century and it is a right which can be asserted by a petition to the Sovereignwhich is referred to the Committee of Privileges of the House of Lords. It isin effect a legal or constitutional right for the denial of which there is an appropriateremedy. The so-called right of a peer to attend the Coronation is somethingdifferent: (1) I have looked in vain for the record of any assertion of a right:(2) the purpose of attendance at the Coronation is recognition and homage, a duty to be performed by the peer and nothing but a duty, whereas his right to be summoned to Parliament arose not merely from his duty to give counsel to theKing, but from his own interest to see that others who were summoned did not give counsel prejudicial to him.It appears to me then that the so-called right of attendance is like any otherright of service at the Coronation, i.e., it is a right^ which a person can claim toexercise only so long as the Sovereign requires him to exercise it.&apos; Thus, in the past,the regulation of all matters at the Coronation has been a matter for the Sovereign^pleasure. So-called customary rights are only exercised at the Sovereign^ pleasure,and the Sovereign may dispense with any service or right, however long it mayhave been established by custom. Thus, in 1901, the doing of homage individuallyby peers was dispensed with, and at all Coronations since then it has been doneonly by the premier noble of each of the five ranks on behalf of the others. So,also, at Coronations since that of William IV (when the procession and banquetwere for the first time omitted) it has been the practice of the Sovereign expresslyby proclamation to dispense &quot; with the services and attendance of all persons who,by ancient custom and usage, or in regard of their tenures of any manors, lands orother hereditaments, do claim, and are bound to do and perform, any services atthe time of the Coronation which, according to ancient custom or usage, are to be performed in Westminster Hall or in the procession.&quot; This proclamation is issued on the advice of the Coronation Committee of the Privy Council, and in the recitalsthe purpose of the dispensation is stated as being &quot; to make the said arrangements as much abridged and as economical as possible.&quot;
It is in my opinion, therefore, clear that the Sovereign may dispense with the attendance or services of anyone at the Coronation, and if it is correct to speak atall of the right of peers to attend, it is a right that is subject to the overriding pleasureof the Sovereign and must be distinguished from their right to attend Parliament,the latter being a right in respect of which the Sovereign has no power ofdispensation.The Sovereign therefore has power to order any arrangements which may beconsidered right to limit the number of peers, peeresses and dowager peeresses who may attend the Coronation Service. Whether these arrangements should properly be made by proclamation upon the advice of the Coronation Committee of the privy Council (as is done in the case of the Westminster Hall ceremonies and theprocession) or by some other means such as a notice in the Gazette, will depend upon what practical proposals are to be made to limit the number.SIMONDS.14th October, 1952.
