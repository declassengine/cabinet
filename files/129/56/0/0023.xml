(52) 37331st October, 1952CABINETPREPARATIONS FOR THE commonwealth economic conference memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Preparatory Meeting of Commonwealth Officials drew ,up five reports for submission to Commonwealth Governments. Copies of these are attached. these documents, which were unanimously approved by all delegations, together forman agreed statement of the stage reached as a result of the talks between Common-wealth officials. They will form the basis of discussion at the forthcoming conference of Ministers.2. The first of these reports (C.E.C. (O) (52) 25) is no more than a guide tothe remaining papers.The second (C.E.C. (O) (52) 24) deals with Short-term Balance of PaymentsProspects. The Cabinet will wish to consider this in connection with the memo-randa which the Chancellor of the Exchequer will shortly be submitting on theUnited Kingdom import programme and balance of payments prospects.The third report (C.E.C. (O) (52) 23) deals with Development Policy. On this the Cabinet will wish to consider whether the prospects of strengthening the balanceof payments by intensifying development in the sterling Commonwealth are sufficiently promising to justify a special effort by the United Kingdom to make some contribution to that development. We shall be expected to make our inten-tions known in principle at the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters: the Chancellor of the Exchequer is considering this question and will submit a separate memorandum on it later.The fourth report (C.E.C. (O) (52) 22) deals with Commodity Policy. Aseparate memorandum will also be submitted to the Cabinet on this question.3. The remaining report (C.E.C. (O) (H.D.) (52) ,1) on Finance and Tradedeals with the problem of attaining convertibility of sterling. This is the most difficult of the issues which will come before the Conference in November. It isalso the issue which requires most urgent consideration by the Cabinet; for other commonwealth Governments should be informed, before their representativesleaves for London, what proposals the United Kingdom Government intend toput forward on this issue for discussion at the Conference in November.My Committee on. Preparations for the Commonwealth Economic Conferencehave considered this question and I shall submit their recommendations to theCabinet before the end of this week.4. Meanwhile, as the issues are so complicated, I am circulating the attachedreports at once so that my colleagues may have an opportunity of studying themin advance of the papers, which will be circulated shortly, on the policy whichthe United Kingdom Government should put forward at the forthcoming conference.A.

II -I toSECRETCopy No. 474C.E.C. (O) (52) 25 (Final)15th October, 1952COMMONWEALTH ECONOMIC CONFERENCEPreparatory Meeting of OfficialsGENERAL REPORTCommonwealth officials met between 22nd September and 15th October, 1952,to prepare for the Commonwealth Economic Conference in November.2. The United Kingdom Government had previously circulated the following draft agenda for that Conference:  (1) Review of economic development in recent years and future prospects.(2) Objectives in external economic policy.(3) Aspects of these objectives and of the means for achieving them.(a) Financial policy.(b) Economic development.(c) Trade policy.(d) Commodity policy.(e) International institutions.(4) Co-operation with other countries.(5) Short-term balance of payments prospects of the sterling area, and policy. Discussion* at the Preparatory Meeting took place on the basis of thisagenda. After a general discussion which covered items (1) and (2) of the agendait was found convenient to consider the remaining items under four main heads: -(Items 3 (e) and (4) of the agenda were considered under Finance and Trade.)4. The starting point in considering all these questions was the statement issued by the Meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers last January (AnnexII). This declared that the general aims of the Finance Ministers would best beachieved when the world-wide trade of the sterling area was on a substantially higher level, when sterling was freely convertible into the main currencies of theworld and when its position need no longer be supported by restrictions on imports.The purpose of the preparatory meetings was to consider the means of moving towards these objectives.5. Four reports were prepared dealing with the subjects listed in paragraph 3.These reports, though all directed to the purpose indicated in the last paragraph,are self-contained documents.  This document only indicates their broad features.6. The Report on the Short-Term Balance of Payments Outlook analyses theprospects of the sterling area balance of payments up to the middle of 1953 andindicates the considerations to which importance should be attached in the formu-lation of short-term policy affecting the balance of payments.7. The Report on Development Policy surveys the part that developmentcan play in strengthening the sterling area; the conditions necessary if progress towards this end is to be achieved; and the problems to be overcome.8. The Report on Commodity Policy deals with the general principles ofcommodity policy and the various ways in which Governments might seek to moderate fluctuations in price caused by short-term disparities between supply and demand.for 1953.(a) Short-term balance of payments outlook.(b) Development policy.(c) Commodity policy.(d) Finance and Trade.* This was based on a series of documents listed in Annex I.43047-4B
9. The Report on Finance and Trade is concerned with the approach to con-vertibility. The objective having been laid down by the Commonwealth finance ministers, the discussion centres inevitably on questions of method and timing mrelation to this objective. Various possibilities are examined in the report, in par-ticuiar proposals tabled by the United Kingdom delegation for a collective approachin association with certain other countries to the convertibility of currencies andthe progressive liberalisation of trade.10. None of the material prepared was designed for publication and nocommunique to the press was issued at the end of the meeting.London, S.W.1,15th October, 1952.1.2.3.4.5.6.10.11.12.13.ANNEX IDocuments before the Preparatory Meeting of OfficialsStatement by the United Kingdom Delegation ...Statement by the Canadian Delegation ...Commonwealth Economic Statistics(Memorandum by the United Kingdom Dele-gation)The Economic Background        ...      ...      ...(Memorandum by the United Kingdom Dele-gation)Commodity Policy ...(Memorandum by the United Kingdom Dele-gation)The United States Import Tariff, the &quot;BuyAmerican &quot; Act, &amp;c, and United States ShippingPolicy(Memorandum by the United Kingdom Dele-gation)United States Investment in the Sterling Area(Interim Report by the Washington Group setup by the Commonwealth Working Party on development)Imperial Preference .....,(Memorandum by the United Kingdom Dele-gation)Draft Conference Agenda......      ....(Note by the United Kingdom Delegation)Summary of the Paley Report     ...      ......(Note by the United Kingdom Delegation)The Collective Approach to Convertibility(Memorandum by the United Kingdom Dele-gation)The Experience of 1949..........(Memorandum by the United Kingdom Dele-gation)Development(a) in the Commonwealth(Memorandum by the United kingdom delegation)(b) United Kingdom      ............(Memorandum by the United kingdom delegation)(c) Colonies        ...      .........(Memorandum by the United kingdom delegation)C.E.O.

The crisishas arisen because the sterling area as a whole is spending more than it is earning,with the result that its gold and dollar reserves have been falling at a rapid rate.2. We are confident that this situation can be set right, and that the steps which will be taken will give to sterling the strength it must have to continue as awidely used international currency.3. We are convinced that this cannot be attained by negative and restrictivemethods alone, or merely by the imposition of cuts on imports from certain partsof the world. The present difficulties of the sterling area, while partly due to short-term factors, also reflect continuing underlying problems. These problems mustand can be solved. For this reason we are strongly of the opinion that measures taken to stop the drain upon reserves must form part of a long-term policy designedto restore and maintain the full strength of sterling.&apos; 43047-4 B 2
4. It is quite clear that the only way to prevent recurrent drains on the centralgold reserves is for every country in the area strenuously to endeavour to live withinthe means which are, or can be, available to it. The sterling area as a whole mustsucceed in this endeavour.5. The urgency of the immediate situation, and the present level of the gold reserves, require that the sterling area as a whole should be in balance with the restof the world at latest in respect of the second half of 1952. It is imperative thatthis should include at least a balance with the dollar area within the same period.6. During the course of our discussions the Finance Ministers and represen-tatives of the Commonwealth countries in the sterling area agreed to bring urgentlyto the attention of their Governments the critical nature of the present situationand the need for immediate corrective action. In this connection they will put before their Governments certain definite proposals calculated in the aggregate to ensurethat the sterling area as a whole will be in balance with the rest of the world inrespect of the second half of 1952. Proposals to the same end will be recommendedby the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governments of the territories withwhich he is concerned.7. It was also agreed that, where any country in the sterling area was likelyto be in overall deficit, corrective measures should be taken as soon as possiblein order to relieve the current pressure on the resources of the area.8. The methods by which members will contribute to these ends are withinthe discretion of each country concerned and will vary according to their individualcircumstances. The first, and most important, step is to ensure that the internal economy is sound and that all possible measures are taken to combat inflation. Thisis not only essential for an improvement in the balance of payments, but it willalso help to keep down the cost of living. Another important requirement is toincrease exports and earning power. In some cases long-term borrowing from outside the sterling area may be practicable. Finally, so far as other methods donot fully achieve the desired results, it will be necessary, as a temporary measure,to reduce imports.II9. It was agreed that, while emergency measures to stop the immediate drainupon the gold reserves were necessary and inevitable, they could only be palliatives.A lasting solution of the sterling area&apos;s problems must be found in order to preventthe recurrence of crises, to make sterling strong and to establish the economies of member countries on a sound and stable basis.10. These aims can best be achieved when the world-wide trade of the sterling area is on a substantially higher level than at present, when sterling is freely con-vertible into all the main currencies of the world and its position need no longer be supported by restrictions on imports. When this state of affairs has been reachedthe countries of the sterling area will have freer access to the output of north america and other important regions and to adequate resources of external capital for development.11. It is accordingly necessary that for some years to come the sterling area should be in surplus with the rest of the world (including a surplus with the dollar area), and that, after taking account of available sterling assets and long-terminvestment from abroad, all member countries should balance their externalaccounts.12. To do this in the face of the need for national security and higher standards of living-clearly requires the maximum possible expansion of earningpower. By the development of their productive power members of the sterling area will not only strengthen their own economies but will also help to meet the inevitablygrowing world demand for food, raw materials and other essential goods.13. Such development will require the investment of substantial financial resources, and it is clear that, after taking account of whatever they themselvescan provide, it will be necessary for many member countries to obtain thoseresources from overseas. For some time to come the Commonwealth will not beable.to meet its growing needs entirely from its own resources, and developing countries will therefore need to rely in varying degrees on investment from outsidethe sterling area. We are agreed that such investment is to be welcomed, and. thatall necessary steps should be taken to encourage it. :
14. We feel that the production of essential raw materials within the sterling area would greatly encouraged by regularity in purchases of such materials bycounts outside the area, as this would contribute materially to the long-termstability of the area and, indeed, of the free world as a whole.15. We are also agreed that an examination should be made as quickly aspossible of the opportunities for an early increase in the productive power of member countries and of the possibilities of matching available financial and tech-nical resources with the enterprises most likely to achieve that purpose. this examination should take account not only of the general development require-ments of member countries and of their need for capital equipment, but also of thepossibilities of increasing their production of food, raw materials and other essential goods.16.  We have made arrangements for such an examination to begin forthwith.III.17. While steps are thus being taken to overcome the immediate problems ofthe sterling area and to accelerate its development, we agree that its recoverywill not be complete until the conditions have been created in which sterlingcan become and remain convertible.18. Accordingly it is our definite objective to make sterling convertible andto keep it so. We intend to work towards that goal by progressive steps aimed at creating the conditions under which convertibility can be reached and maintained.19. It is primarily the responsibility of the members of the sterling area them-selves to create these conditions (including the achievement of adequate gold reserves); but they cannot be completely realised without the active co-operation ofother countries, notably those countries which are consistently in surplus with therest of the world.20. We have arranged for an investigation of the steps which should betaken along the road to convertibility to begin forthwith.IV.21. We reaffirm the need for frequent and comprehensive consultation between Governments within the Commonwealth on the problems of the sterling area. In particular, steps will be taken within the next few months and fromtime to time to review progress on the measures now being taken and proposed.London, S.W. 1.
confidential.E.C. (O) (52) 24 (Final)11th October, 1952Copy No.5 1 3COMMONWEALTH ECONOMIC CONFERENCEPreparatory Meeting of OfficialsREPORT ON THE SHORT-TERM BALANCE OF PAYMENTSOUTLOOKIntroductionThe work of the Committee has been directed to examining the course of sterling area countries&apos; balance of payments since the Commonwealth finance ministers&apos; Meeting in January 1952, and to analysing the prospects for the second half of this year and for the first half of next year. We have examined the balanceof payments position. of each country and the various measures, internal and external, which they have taken.2. The Canadian delegation have participated fully in the work of theCommittee, but the report deals only with the position of the sterling area countries.Commonwealth Finance Ministers&apos; Meeting, January 19523. The situation with which the Commonwealth Finance Ministers were faced may be summarised as follows: a sterling area surplus^ of close upon  300million with the non-sterling world in the first half of 1951 changed in the second half of the year into a deficit of over  700 million. This deficit was necessarilyreflected in a very sharp decline in the central reserves of the sterling area, which fell from a peak of  1,381 million on 30th June, 1951, to  834 million by31st December, 1951.4. Following a review of the balance of payments situation at the end of1951, the Commonwealth Finance Ministers proposed two broad aims of policy.The first of these, as embodied in the statement issued at the end of the meeting,ran as follows:  &quot;5. The urgency of the immediate situation, and, the present level ofgold reserves, require that the sterling area as a whole should be in balancewith the rest of the world at latest in respect of the second half of 1952. It is imperative that this should include at least balance with the dollar area withinthe same period.&quot;In addition, the Commonwealth Finance Ministers stressed the importance of individual countries attaining overall balance as soon as possible and attached great weight to the importance of taking all possible steps to combat inflation. Themeans by which the general aim was to be met and the pace at which it was prac-ticable to achieve balance necessarily varied from one Commonwealth country toanother.5. Subsequently in March the worsening of the situation led the UnitedKingdom to suggest that the sterling area should aim at a current surplus with therest of the world in the second half of 1952 instead of the balance which had beenagreed in January.6. In the period following the Commonwealth Finance Ministers&apos; Meetingthe general situation deteriorated. The fall in prices of some sterling area primary products from February 1952 onwards reduced export earnings of many sterling area countries and made.the attainment of even the original objectives much moredifficult.The Sterling Area&apos;s Balance of Payments7. The following table shows the course of the balance of payments of the sterling area with the rest of the world in 1951 and the first half of 1952, together* &quot; Surplus &quot; or &quot; deficit &quot;, as used in this report, is the balance of payments on current account-and some of the official capital and financial transactions.43047-3 B
with forecasts for the second half of .1952 and the first half of 1953. The tablesummarises the detailed figures which are contained in the Report of the StatisticsSub-Committee, attached as Appendix III.Table ASterling Area Balance with the Rest of the World, 1951-1953				 	million	1951	1951	1952	1952	1953	1st half	2nd half	1st half	2nd half	1st half				forecast	forecastExport       ............	1,960	1,488	1,561&apos;	1,327	1,481Imports      ............	1,788	2,191	1,915	1,474	1,487Invisibles (net, including defence					aid)        ..;      .........	^ 25	-181	- 19	-   4	+ 23Gold sales, I.M.F. and I.B.R.D.					receipts, &amp;c.......      ...	87	149	158	123	98&quot;Surplus/deficit&quot;	+2s5	-735	-215	- 28	- +115Of which with 					Dollar area    .........	4-118	-349	-131	- 39	- 27O.E.E.C.       ......	&apos; 4109	-243	- 91	- 23	-f- 89Other non-sterling countries ...	4- 57	-143	4-   7	+ 34	+ 538. It must be borne in mind that the balance of payments of the sterling areawith the rest of the world is considerably affected by seasonal factors. Exports of wool, cotton, jute and cocoa tend to be higher in the first half of the year than inthe second. The annual payments on North American loans by the UnitedKingdom fall due on 31st December and the United Kingdom imports tend to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year than in the first. Consequently the sterling area&apos;s external balance tends to be more favourable in the first half of theyear than in the second.The First Hall of 19529. In the first half of 1952 the sterling area&apos;s deficit with the rest of the worldwas reduced from  735 million to  215 million. The largest sums in this reductionof  520 million were a cut of  232 million in United Kingdom imports and of 43 million to the Colonies&apos; imports; a largely seasonal increase in exports of  73million; and a reduction in the invisible deficit by  162 million. The improvementin invisibles was mainly due to the United Kingdom&apos;s receipt of  75 million ofdefence aid from the United States, and the fact that the interest payment on north american loans, totalling  40 million, fell in the second half of 1951.The Second Half of 195210. The forecast for this period is still subject to uncertainty. Broadly, itassumes the present levels of world prices. On this assumption, the forecastssuggest that in the second half of 1952 the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments withthe rest of the world may show a small deficit. By far the most important part ofthis forecast improvement, as compared with the first half of this year, is the very marked reduction in imports; the earnings from sterling area exports are expectedto be substantially less than in the first half of the year. Latest informationindicates that the situation in the current half year may be slightly better than the forecasts embodied in the table. It seems likely therefore that the objectiveindicated last January for a balance between the sterling area and the rest of theworld in the second half of 1952 may be broadly achieved.   &apos;&apos; ,The First Half of 195311. On the assumption that there is no new adverse movement in the world economy and that the present levels of world prices are generally maintained, it istentatively forecast that the sterling area may be in surplus with the rest of the worldby about  100 million. Sterling area imports are expected to remain at about thelevel ruling in the second half of 1952, but it is hoped that there will be an increasein exports (largely seasonal in character) of about  150 million. Invisible tran-section are likely to improve, mainly Owing to the absence of interest payments on
North American loans in the first half of the year. The total surplus with the non-sterling world would still comprise a small deficit with the dollar area, which is morethan counter-balanced by surpluses with the O.E.E.G. and other non-sterling countries.Movements in the Gold and Dollar Reserves12. The surplus or deficit set out in the foregoing analysis does not reflect the full effect of changes in the balance of payments of sterling area countries on thecentral reserves. In fact, the deficit of  735 million in the second half of 1951 was reduced by other capital transactions (predominantly drawing on credits with theEuropean Payments Union) to a drawing on the reserves of  547 million. In thefirst half of 1952, however, the exhaustion of E.P.U. credits meant that other capitalitems contributed nothing to financing the deficit (indeed, they added to it slightly),so that it had to be met entirely by drawings on the reserves.Table BMovement of Reserves2nd half1951&quot; Surplus/deficit&quot; (as in Table A)   ...      ...       -735Other capital items     ............       4-188*Drawings on reserves............ 547Level of gold reserves Beginning of period       .........        1,381End of period      ............ 834* Mainly E.P.U. drawings.13. For the second half of 1952 and the first half of 1953 it is impossible tomake a precise analysis of the implications for the gold reserves of the surplusesand deficits indicated in Table B. The following types of capital transactions haveto be taken into account:  (a) repayment of debt, and private capital inflow and outflow;(b) as the sterling area moves into surplus with E.P.U., the surplus is settledonly partly in gold, and partly by repayment of debt to E.P.U.;(c) surpluses with other non-sterling non-dollar countries may result in a fallin their sterling balances, and not entirely in receipts of gold.14. In the third quarter of 1952 the gold reserves were unchanged. TheUnited Kingdom delegation have made a tentative forecast, taking the aboveconsiderations into account, that there will be a loss of reserves of  25 million to 50 million in the fourth quarter of 1952 and an increase of  30 million to  60million in the first half of 1953, if the forecasts of &quot; surplus/deficit &quot; in Table B are fulfilled.15. Thus the level of the gold reserves in the year 1952-53* would remainfairly stable at about  600 million, i.e., over  200 million less than at the time ofthe Commonwealth Finance Ministers&apos; Meeting in January. Moreover, it mustbe recognised that the improvement in reserves which is forecast for the first halfof 1953 is largely due to seasonal factors. The level of reserves of  600 million is a low figure in relation to the annual turnover of transactions between the sterling area and the rest of the world, now estimated at about  9,000 million.  million1st half    2nd half     1st half1952 1952 1953forecast    forecast-215       - 28       4-us- 17 ......232834 602602 (See paragraph 14 below)Overall Balance of Payments16. Corresponding to the improvement in the sterling area&apos;s balance ofpayments with the rest of the world, there has been a great improvement in the overall balance of payments of individual sterling area countries. The UnitedKingdom (after taking credit for defence aid) expects to be in substantial overallsurplus in the year 1952-53; the Colonies, on the other hand, are likely to move* I.e., the year from July 1952 to June 1953.43047-3 b 2
into slight deficit; nearly all of the independent sterling area countries (after allowing for official capital inflow only) will be very much nearer overall balance in 1952-53 than in 1951-52.17. The sterling balances of the independent sterling area countries declined from  2,192 million in June 1951 to  1,513 million in June 1952. Many of theindependent sterling area countries have now reached a position in which their sterling balances are at a level at which future policy is likely to be concerned eitherto check the rate of withdrawals severely or to ensure that there will be no furthernet withdrawals at all. Indeed, some countries may wish to build up their balances.On the other hand, Colonial sterling balances have risen from  908 million inJune 1951 to  1,042 million in June 1952, and their reserves are correspondinglyat a much more adequate level than those of independent sterling area countries.1952-53 compared with 1951-5218.

The improvement which has so far taken place in the sterling area&apos;balance of payments has not been due to an expansion of exports. Indeed, thevalue of sterling area exports in 1952-53 is expected to be less than in 1951-52.Both for United Kingdom manufactures and for the primary commodity exportsof the rest of the sterling area, conditions of world demand are now less favourable than they were a year ago., 20. There has been not only a significant fall in the level of demand for a wide range of primary commodities and manufactures, but demand has been satisfied to a considerable extent by drawing upon the heavy stocks accumulatedduring 1951-52. It is noteworthy that world demand for manufactures is noweven more heavily concentrated than before on capital goods. The prices of manysterling area exports have fallen heavily since January 1952 (see Appendix I).. :. 21. On the supply side, there are the following considerations. In a numberOf eases, it is not possible to increase primary production significantly in the shortterm. As a result of internal economic policies throughout the sterling area moregoods have become available for export, and production for export has beenstimulated, but further steps will be needed to ensure that there are no supplylimitations on the expansion of sterling area export earnings.  In some countries
transport is still a limiting factor. In the United Kingdom the expansion of produc-tion for export by the engineering industries has been limited by the developmentof the defence production programme.22. Prices are also a significant factor. In the case of certain primary com-modities there is competition from synthetics (e.g., rubber) and from substitutematerials (e.g., jute). For most primary commodities international conditions are becoming increasingly competitive. In the case of manufactures, apart from pricecompetition as such, the ability to quote firm prices against forward deliveries and,more particularly, to offer competitive delivery dates is necessary for an expansionof export earnings.23. Against the background of measures to combat inflation, there has been some tendency for sterling area exports to become more competitive during recent months, but it is not possible to make any quantitative assessment.Imports24. The forecast improvement in the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments position between 1951-52 and 1952-53 is entirely dependent on the reduction in imports. Imports from the rest of the world are expected to fall by 28 per cent,between 1951-52 and 1952-53. All sterling area countries have placed restrictionson imports, the pattern of which is set out in Appendix II. These restrictions havebeen accompanied by anti-inflationary measures of various kinds to reduce internaldemand.25. The demand for imports has been greatly reduced during the past nine months by the change in general economic conditions. The fall in export earningshas, with some delay, led to a fall in internal purchasing power; the stock positionis easy because of overbuying and speculative purchases in 1951.26. Government action has thus been helped by economic forces in bringingdown imports. Circumstances vary from country to country, but it is fairly clearthat the present restricted level of imports is less than would be expected if directcontrols were removed. The gap is less than it was at the time when the intensifiedrestrictions were imposed. There is, however, reason to fear that in some countries the running down of stocks may lead to an increase in demand for imports and to greater pressure on the controls than is felt at present. To continue to maintainimports for a long period at as low a level as that forecast may call for more rigorousinternal measures, but some delegations have pointed out that in their countriesinternal measures alone cannot be a complete substitute for import restrictions.Invisibles and Other Capital Transactions27. Apart from imports and exports, there is a wide range of so-called&quot; invisible &quot; transactions, which include services (such as shipping), net earnings from the operation of oil companies, travel, interest, profits and dividends and overseas governmental expenditure and receipts. A considerable improvement is expected in these as a whole in 1952-53 compared with 1951-52. Significantrecent developments in this regard are the receipts of defence aid by the UnitedKingdom from the United States, which in the year 1951-52 amounted to  76 million and in the year 1952-53 seem likely to amount to  160 million; it is unlikely thataid will be available on anything like this scale in 1953-54. Allowance is madefor the payment by the United Kingdom of  40 million of interest due on31st December, 1952, on North American loans. In addition, some loans havebeen received by several countries from the I.B.R.D. and I.M.F.The Importance of Internal Policies28. Within the last year all countries in the sterling area have carried outinternal financial and economic policies designed to reduce inflationary pressures.These have included the raising of interest rates, the imposition of restrictions on credit, the reduction or abolition of food subsidies and increases in taxation. these have necessarily varied in kind and degree of effectiveness in the differing economic circumstances of sterling area countries. On the whole it seems reasonable tosay that these measures have contributed significantly to improving the sterling area&apos;s balance of- payments with the rest of the world. There is little doubt thatthe internal situation in sterling area countries is healthier than in January 1952.
29.  The conclusions which emerge are as follows.(a) The sterling area is likely broadly to achieve the immediate aim set by theCommonwealth Finance Ministers Meeting of being in balance withthe rest of the world in the second half of 1952. All countries havetaken action contributing to this.(b) On the assumptions that-(i) there is no new major adverse movement in the world economy,(ii) the present import control and internal policies are strictlymaintained throughout the sterling area,the gold and dollar reserves are likely to be maintained at aroundtheir persent level throughout the period to June 1953.(c) The reduction in the level of reserves during the last year, both of thecentral gold and dollar reserves and of the sterling reserves of mostof the independent sterling area countries, means that the sterling area countries, both individually and as a whole, must live within their resources, including such capital inflow and assistance as they may beable to obtain externally. It is desirable that the sterling area shouldearn a surplus in order that the reserves shall be built up.(d) The improvement has been brought about mainly by large import reduc-tions and not by increase in exports.(e) There are indications that the pressure to increase imports will steadilygrow.(/) It is consequently necessary for the sterling area to increase its export earnings; internal and developmental policies can contribute much tothis objective.(g) Tighter internal policies introduced by sterling area countries have alreadyeffected some reduction in the demand for imports. The role of suchpolicies in maintaining and improving the sterling area&apos;s balance ofpayments with the rest of the world is likely to be of crucial importanceboth in its effect on imports and in increasing competitive power and production for export.London, S.W. 1,11th October, 1952.

APPENDIX IIICOMMONWEALTH ECONOMIC CONFERENCEPreparatory Meeting of OfficialsCOMMITTEE ON SHORT-TERM BALANCE OF PAYMENTS OUTLOOKReport by the Statistics Sub-CommitteeThe Statistics Sub-Committee of the Committee on Short-Term Balance ofPayments Outlook were asked to examine the statistics of sterling area countries&apos;balance of payments and to report back. The Sub-Committee have had threemeetings and have agreed on this report.2. The main work of the Sub-Committee has consisted of bringing together the estimates and forecasts for the balance of payments received from individualCommonwealth countries and of adjusting the figures, in order to take accountof latest developments and to bring them on to a common basis for the use of theConference. The main results are set out below in this report and in the attachedStatistical Appendix.3. The tables embodying the material provided by individual commonwealth countries are set out below. In general they follow the lines of the tables used atthe Commonwealth Finance Ministers Meeting in January 1952. This means thatthe tables show the current account of each country, together with some capitaltransactions, mostly of an official nature. This does not represent a total capital account, but it is as near as it is possible to get to it, for reasons given in paragraph6. The main addition to the tables is the capital account of the whole sterling area for the second half of 1951 and the first half of 1952, shown in Table 6, but this cannot be extended to later periods.List of TablesBalance of PaymentsNet balance of payments, sterling and non-sterlingGross transactions, sterling and non-sterlingNet balance of payments with non-sterling countriesGross   transactions   with   non-sterling   countries(summary) ......Gross   transactions  with  non-sterling  countries,showing individual countries.........Capital account for the whole sterling area, second half 1951 and first half 1952    .........Exports of Sterling Area CountriesSummary       ..................Individual commodities and countries4. As a result of the experience gained in preparing information of this character we think that the figures used on this occasion represent an advance on those used at the Finance Ministers Meeting in January 1952. Subject to the notesabout assumptions, and about the usual difficulties of forecasting which are setout below, we have found that there is an increasing identity of view between thevarious countries concerned about the nature of the figures.Main Assumptions5. The main assumptions upon which the forecasts have been based are asfollows:  (a) Imports have been based on the best estimates of overseas availabilities,taking into account such factors as, for example, rearmament, currentpolicies and the level of internal demand.Table 1Table 2Table stable 4Table 5Table 6Table 7Table 8
(b) Exports are based on the best forecasts of demand.   Prices are usuallythe average of the last two or three months, except where it has been felt that a significant movement affecting individual commodities isto be expected.(c) It is assumed that there will be no major change in the present situation ofbusiness activity in the United States.It is necessary to underline the extreme difficulty of making accurate forecasts ofthe sales of most of the commodities produced in the sterling area. comparatively small changes in prices can have a very big effect on the balance of payments.Thus, a change of Id. per pound in the price of Australian wool will change theAustralian balance of payments for better or for worse by nearly  4 million. Forthis reason the Sub-Committee particularly wish to emphasise that the forecasts forthe first half of 1953 must be treated with considerable reserve. At every stage itis necessary to bear in mind the assumptions which have been made in making these forecasts and the great extent to which the forecasts may be changed byunforseen developments.Treatment of the Current and Capital Account6. Tables 1-5 show the current account of the sterling area countries; inaddition certain capital items, mainly of an official nature, have been added whereit is considered that the information about these is reasonably firm. The resulting&quot; surplus or deficit &quot; is, therefore, a hybrid, since the capital items are not complete.The Sub-Committee considered whether it was possible to provide a more adequateindication of the capital account. The conclusion reached was that it was notpossible to complete the capital acount for a variety of reasons. Chief among these were the difficulties of estimating movements of private long-term capital andespecially of making forecasts for the future. There is also some doubt about someof the sources of official finance in the future.7. At the same time the Sub-Committee recognised that the absence of a capital account was in some respects misleading, since it tends to give rise to anincomplete view of the sterling area&apos;s position with the rest of the world. Forthis reason a capital account for the whole of the sterling area has been compiledfor the second half of 1951 and the first half of 1952. The details of this are shownin Table 6, which also indicates how this capital account fits into the sterling areacurrent account and the &quot; surplus/deficit &quot; for those periods. The Sub-Committeehave not felt able to break down this capital account as between individual countries.  The principal effect of this is summarised in the following table:  Sterling Area Balance of payments. Current balance       ......2. Gold sales and official finance3. &quot; Surplus/deficit &quot;     ......4. Other capital items   ......5.

In considering the above table it is necessary to bear in mind, first, the qualifications attaching to the forecasts upon which this improvement is based,and, secondly, the fact that the first half of the year is normally more favourable to the sterling area as a whole than the second half of the year. It is, therefore,particularly necessary to take each year as a whole. The deficit on non-sterlingaccount for 1951-52 was  950 million, and the forecast for 1952-53 is a surplusof  87 million. Neither of these figures, as explained in paragraph 7, takes accountof contractual and other capital items.3rd October, 1952.

.  annex note on Main Assumptions on Sterling Area Exports in 1952-53.Tables 7 and 8 show the principal commodities exported by sterling area countries in 1952 (two halves) and the first half of 1953. The forecasts for thesecond half of 1952 and the first half of 1953 are based in general on prices rulingin the third quarter of 1952. They are mostly based on trade account figures;therefore, the figures quoted for total exports differ in certain minor respects fromthe balance of payments date in Tables 1 to 5. Individual countries have madethe following specific points:  1. United KingdomThe forecast of total United Kingdom exports assumes little change in averagevalues compared with the first half of .1952, as rises in the price of certain items are likely to be balanced by falls elsewhere.2. Colonies(a) RubberVolume of Malayan exports expected to fall slightly in 1953 and a price ofIs. 8d. per lb. f.o.b. has been assumed for the year 1952-53. (1951-52 average price, 2s. lOd. per lb.)(b) TinMalayan exports expected to fall slightly in tonnage in the first half of .1953,compared with 1952; price assumed is  930 per ton, f.o.b. (1951-52 average price, 920 per ton.)(c) CocoaForecast assumes virtually no change in volume of exports in 1952-53 comparedwith 1951-52. Price assumed is an average of  200 per ton f.o.b. (1951-52 average price,  250 per ton.)(d) GroundnutsBig increase in exports in .1952-53 owing to. improved crops and transportconditions. Price assumed, however, is somewhat lower, at  75 per ton. (1951-52average price,  80 per ton.)(e) CottonSome increase in exports of Ugandan cotton, mainly to India, is estimated, atan average price of 3s. 3d. per lb.  (1951-52 average price, 3s. 9d. per lb.)(f) SugarA slight reduction is allowed for in exports in the first half of 1953 comparedwith the first half of 1952. The 1952-53 price is taken as  38 per ton as comparedwith  35 per ton.(g) CopperExports of about 335,000 tons in 1952-53 at an average price of  260 per tonare estimated.   (1951-52 average price,  210 per ton.)3. australia the assumed price of wool for the second half of 1952 is 70d. (Aust.) per lb.greasy, compared with 72-Ad. (Aust.) per lb. greasy during 1951-52 and with anaverage price slightly in excess of 15d. (Aust.) per lb. at the end of September.These assumptions may have to be reviewed when the 1952-53 Australian auctionssettle down. A decline of 5 per cent, in the quantity of wool exports is allowed for in 1952-53 compared with 1951-52.
The forecasts for exports of wool to the dollar area in July-December 1952includes about 170,000 bales to the United States (compared with 250,000 bales insame period 1951) at an average price of 10 per cent, above the overall average.Shipments of wheat and flour are expected to decline in the second half of1952 to 32 million bushels compared with 58 million bushels in the same periodof 1951, due to the fall in production from 184 million bushels in 1950-51 to161 million bushels in 1951-52.4. New ZealandAn average price of 30d. per lb. is assumed for wool during 1952-53 and thevolume is put at 420,000 bales for the second half of 1952 and 760,000 bales forthe first half of 1953. Forecasts for meat and dairy produce as follows:  Butter and Cheese. The United Kingdom contract prices for the. 1952-53season are as follows:  Per cwt.Butter (finest grades).........      ...      3.14s.Cheese (finest grades)......      ...      ...      176s.12^ per cent, of the exportable surplus of butter and 10 per cent, of the cheesesurplus may be sold in outside markets where prices are somewhat higher. Butterexports during the year 1952-53 are estimated at 150,000 tons compared with144,000 tons in 1951-52; cheese exports for 1952-53 are estimated at 95,000 tons compared with 93,800 tons for 1951-52.Meat. As a result of the recent contractual agreement with United Kingdom,New Zealand is to receive a 12^ per cent, increase in price for meat shipped to theUnited Kingdom during the 1952-53 season.No average price is given because of the difference arising from a pricedifferential in various markets and the numerous types and grades of meat exports.It is forecast that 350,000 tons will be shipped during 1952-53 compared with330,000 tons in 1951-52.5.

The price ofCalcutta hessians fell from about 148s. per 100 yds. in the first quarter of 1952to 84s. in June. Since then, it fell a little further in August but has since recoveredto the June level.7. PakistanThe prices assumed for exports of jute and cotton are generally based on theprices ruling in September 1952. Details of quantities and prices are shown below
for 1952-53. These prices (particularly those of jute) are appreciably less thanthe prices prevailing during the first half of 1952. In the case of cotton, the forecast larger exports are based on better crop prospects than in the earlier years.	1952		1953		July-December		January-June		Quantity	Price	Quantity	PriceJute Cotton         ......

CONFIDENTIALCopy No.C.E.C. (O) (52) 2312th October, 1952COMMONWEALTH ECONOMIC CONFERENCEPreparatory Meeting of OfficialsREPORT ON DEVELOPMENT policy.-introduction. There is no lack of interest in development in the Commonwealth.Without exception every Commonwealth Government has been concerned with theproblem ever since the war. Throughout the Commonwealth a great deal is alreadygoing ahead which will lead to a considerable measure of expansion of productionand which will have a marked effect on the economies of all commonwealth countries. Nevertheless it is common ground that more development on soundlines is needed, if the sterling area is to strengthen its economic position to an extent which will render possible the maintenance and improvement of living standards. The extent to which these development aims are in fact capable of achievement depends fundamentally on the success of the sterling area in stimulatinginternal savings and attracting for that purpose the maximum amount of outsidecapital.2. The starting point of the discussion during these meetings has been the interim Report of the Commonwealth Working Party on Development. that report called for certain studies of development, and papers had been circulatedby all the sterling Commonwealth Governments represented on development within their own countries. The Committee have also considered a general paper on development policy circulated by the United Kingdom delegation and an interimreport from a Commonwealth Working Party in Washington on the prospects for United States investment in the sterling area.II. The Aims of Development3. The purpose of the Preparatory Meeting has been to examine ways inwhich the trade and financial position of the sterling area might be strengthened.Development within the sterling area has a clear significance in any plan of action for the achievement of that objective. In present circumstances it is a primaryrequirement that development should be directed towards the improvement of thebalance of payments and that there must be strict restraint in development whichdoes not contribute to this end.4. In saying this it is of course realised that, particularly in the less developed countries, other types of development will be essential if schemes of productivedevelopment are to go ahead. Such development satisfies the requirementsuggested, in that it serves the aim of strengthening the balance of payments. TheCommittee appreciate also that a certain amount of investment may be necessarywhich cannot be regarded as strictly economic. With this in mind they endorse the view expressed by the Commonwealth Working Party in paragraph 6 of itsInterim Report &quot; We realise that every country must take into account investment whichit regards as vital to its national security. Moreover, in all countries thereis bound to be some investment which cannot be justified on narrow economic grounds, but which is regarded as essential for other reasons. We are not qualified to criticise in any way development of either type and contentourselves with expressing the view that in countries with balance of payments difficulties there are obvious reasons why the latter should be kept to aminimum.&quot;The need to keep such investment to a minimum is more pressing than ever.Since that report was written, for example, the sterling area&apos;s gold and dollar reserves have declined still further.
5. It is important that development, if it to contribute towards improving the balance of payments, must not only be productive but also economic. Exportsmust be competitive and there should be no place for uncompetitive import-savingproduction which can flourish only behind the barrier of import restrictions. Insome cases some measure of protection, e.g., by import quotas, may be permissiblein the early stages of development, but otherwise Governments should satisfy them-selves so far as possible, before projects go ahead, that their products will becompetitive in delivery, quality and price in a multilateral system. These are the policies for &quot; good debtors &quot; and, to the extent that they are pursued, the case forpressing the United States to adopt &quot; good creditor &quot; policies will be the stronger.III. The Conditions of Development6. The first task has been to consider some of the general conditions, whichmust be satisfied if development is to proceed and under which effort will be concentrated on sound economic development that assists the balance of payments.This consideration has included an examination of the steps which governments may take to help to bring these conditions about.Internal measures the importance of restraint7. In economies which are strained as are those of the sterling area countries to-day, the margin of resources available for investment is bound at best to belimited. It is important, therefore, for each country both to do everything possibleto free the maximum volume of resources for investment and to exercise strictrestraint in those forms of development which are less immediately desirable, sothat the resources which are available may be devoted to the most useful objectives.In this the role of internal financial policy is critical.8. Intensified development necessitates the diversion of resources such aslabour, equipment and materials to projects which will not immediately producegoods or services for consumption. Except, therefore, to the extent that generalproductivity is increasing or additional resources can be obtained from abroad,development can only be expanded either if consumption is reduced or if other forms of activity are restrained. To attempt expansion in both investment and consumption at one and the same time must cause a competition for resources whichis self-defeating. Further, it is likely to generate excessive purchasing power whichin turn will accentuate the competition for goods and the resources with which to produce goods. It is all too clear that in many countries during the post-war years, efforts to expand development too fast or in too many directions, whilestriving also to increase standards of consumption, have been a major cause ofinflationary demand. This excessive internal demand has in turn spilt over intoa demand for more and more imports, accentuating balance of payments difficulties.Again, the tendency for basic development to lag behind productive development has prevented the full utilisation of available resources. Balanced development inall fields of economic activity can make an important contribution to the attainment of viability.9. A sound internal financial policy is essential to produce the sort of economy in which productive development can take place. It supports any physicalcontrols which Governments may find necessary. Without it even the most com-plete apparatus of physical control is bound sooner or later to be frustrated.10. In the first place Governments can, and should, exercise restraint in theirown direct investment. This is of particular importance in that much social andbasic investment is either carried out directly by Government or is subject to detailed control and supervision by Government. This report contains no detailedsuggestions about the way in which individual projects should be examined. It issuggested, however, that Governments should satisfy themselves, before investingin development of this sort or sanctioning investment by authorities which theydirectly control, that the development satisfies the tests suggested in Section II ofthis report.11. Secondly, many Governments may be, exercising powers which enablethem to influence the direction of investment generally; examples are the controlof capital issues, the licensing of imports of essential equipment, the allocation ofscarce materials and so forth. The nature, purpose and scope of these powersdiffer widely from Government to Government, and no detailed recommendations
are made in this report about the ways in which they might be used. Generally,however, it is suggested that Governments should exercise all these controls inaccordance with the need to encourage the right sort of development which assiststhe balance of payments on the lines suggested in Section II.The factor of demand12. For the most part, productive development must be carried out by privateinvestors and private producers. These people will devote their efforts to any typeof development only if they believe that there will be a continuing demand for their output at prices which will give them an economic return.13. It is, therefore, important to select for development those resources forwhich, so far as can be foreseen, there is likely to be an increasing demand. Butthis in itself is not always enough; producers and investors often require firmerassurances of an adequate return before they will undertake increased production,and the experience of the last few years has shown how, even with continuingdemand for a commodity, there can be violent fluctuations in demand and pricesfrom year to year, which can have most serious results for producers.14. The problems of securing stability in demand for and prices of com-modities have been the subject of detailed study in the Committee on commodity policy, and it would not be appropriate in this report either to examine thoseproblems in detail or to recommend methods of dealing with them. It is, however,clear that the existence of assured markets with reasonable stability in prices can help greatly to encourage the development of many essential commodities.IV. Development which is Already in Train15. This report concerns itself with the needs and possibilities of development in the future, since this has been the object of this series of meetings. It would not,however, be complete if it did not refer very briefly to development which is already in train. The Commonwealth Working Party on Development recommended thata special effort be made to complete those projects which were already under way,which could be completed quickly and which would make an early contributionto the sterling area balance of payments. It is clear from the reports which havebeen before the Committee that a considerable effort is being made on these linesby all sterling Commonwealth countries and that a significant number of projectswill be completed in the months ahead. It is agreed that there is urgent need to intensify sound development if the economic strength of the sterling area is to be restored and maintained, but appreciation of the magnitude of the tasks to beundertaken should not obscure the fact that a great deal is already in hand through-out the area.V.- Fields for Further Development16. An attempt has been made on the basis of the information contained inthe papers which have been before the Committee to identify some promising fieldsfor development in the sterling area. Obviously there could be no question of examining all the possibilities; the sterling area produces an immense variety ofgoods, which in the aggregate account for a very large volume of trade but of whichthe individual value is comparatively small; an example would be the rarer non-ferrous metals. The Committee do not in any way. underestimate the importanceof these, but it has been necessary to concentrate on commodities individually of substantial quantitative importance. Nor does this report refer to fields which areat present of great economic importance to the sterling area but which do notappear to offer very great possibility of expansion within the next few years examples might be tea and cocoa. The problem in these cases is one of main-tenance rather than expansion. And finally there is no reference to two commodities-ties of major importance whose production is already being developed as fast as is practicable, namely, oil and gold. There is clearly no suggestion that resources should be diverted from economic production in any of these fields.17.   The attempt has accordingly been to identify those larger items whichoffer the best possibilities for expansion.  The tests which have been applied are that such an expansion will make a substantial contribution to the balance of43047-2 b 2
payments of the sterling area, either by increasing exports or by saving importsfrom outside the area; that there seem to be possibilities for expanding their pro-duction in the area; and that such expanded production would be economic in a multilateral system. It is, of course, a truism that the possibility of increasing theproduction of any commodity will vary from country to country. There is no inten-tion of suggesting that countries in the sterling area should attempt to invest in production for which they are obviously unsuited or that they should undertakedevelopment in the fields suggested at the expense of economic production in other fields.18. In this examination particular attention has been given to the possibilityof increasing exports to the United States and Canada. The prospects of a sub-stantial increase in exports both of raw materials and of manufactures to theUnited States depends in part on the degree to which sterling area production iscompetitive in the United States markets; in part on the rising economic activity of the United States; and in part on the success of any approach to the UnitedStates Government on &quot; good creditor &quot; policies in relation to tariffs, &amp;c. TheCommittee&apos;s conclusion is that there should be increasing opportunity for sales in the United States and that in particular the United States demand for a wide range of raw materials should increase considerably over the years ahead. their view on this is in part based upon the forecasts made in the Paley Report (theReport of the United States Presidents Material Policy Commission) of theprobable increase in United States import requirements of various materials by1975. That Report looks to a very large increase in demand for a wide range ofraw materials, many of which are produced within the sterling area.19. Canada offers a very promising market for sterling area goods. It ispursuing a low tariff policy and imports from the Commonwealth are assisted bytariff preferences. The Canadian economy is expanding with exceptional rapiditywith a very high rate of investment. At present it is capable of absorbing increased supplies of capital goods from the United Kingdom and in addition relies heavily on sterling area sources for non-ferrous metal ores, such as bauxite, manganeseand chrome. Canada&apos;s demand for these and similar materials may be expectedto increase. There are also prospects for increased sales of tropical and semi-tropical produce and for a wide range of manufactured and semi-manufacturedgoods. It is, of course, essential, if sales in Canada are to be increased, that sterling area goods should meet the needs of this highly competitive market in price and in quality and be supported where appropriate by vigorous salesmanship.20. The fields which appear most promising on the assumptions described inthe preceding paragraphs are the following:  (a) Food Grains(i) Wheat. In 1950-51 the sterling area imported some 5-4 million tons of wheat from the dollar area at a cost of $490 million.Plans are in hand for substantially increasing production withinthe area, but consumption is also rising rapidly and the prospectseems to be that the development so far in sight will go only asmall way toward eliminating the area&apos;s deficit. It is unneces-sary to stress the value of further increases in production where this can be done without reducing output of greater assistance tothe balance of payments. There appear to be considerable possi-bilities for a substantial expansion of production in Australia,India and Pakistan.(ii) Rice. Expansion of rice production could make an outstandingcontribution to the welfare and stability of South and South-east asia and also to the balance of payments. commonwealth countries have done, and are doing, a great deal to increase production, but the populations which depend upon rice arealso expanding rapidly. There seems little prospect in theimmediate future of reducing the dependence on imports. efforts are being made to expand rice porduction in India, Pakistan,Ceylon and certain Colonial territories, and it is also possiblethat Australia may be able to increase her production of ricefor export.
(b) Meat and Dairy Produce. There is a need for increased production of meat and dairy produce to meet the requirements of the sterling area,and, since production costs are competitive, there should be good possi-bilities of increased exports both to the United States and Canada andto other non-sterling markets. There are possibilities of considerableincreases in production in Australia and New Zealand.(c) Cotton. Cotton is one of the largest raw material imports from the dollar area; in 1951 sterling area imports amounted to $240 million. Anincrease in the production of American type cotton could, therefore,produce considerable dollar savings. Development of the productionof American type cotton is already in train in Pakistan, Nigeria and east and Central Africa. India is also investigating the possibility of producing this type of cotton.(d) Copper. The net imports of copper into the sterling area from the dollar area in 1951 amounted to 60,000 tons, costing $35 million. Consump-tion of the metal in the sterling area is rising. The Paley Report, more-over, forecasts a rise in United States copper requirements of some43 per cent, between 1950 and 1975, the bulk of which would have to be imported from abroad. There are considerable possibilities for increas-ing the production of copper in the Rhodesias, Cyprus and Ugandaand limited possibilities in Australia.(e) Zinc. In 1951 the sterling area imported from the dollar area 108,000tons of zinc, costing $44 million. Demand for zinc is likely to expandsteadily both in the sterling area and in the United States the PaleyReport forecasts a rise in United States zinc consumption of 39 percent, between 1950 and 1975. There is little likelihood that UnitedStates zinc production will rise to meet its increased needs. increased production of zinc would therefore be valuable both to meet the ster-ling area&apos;s rising need and in the longer term as a possible export tothe United States. There are possibilities of increased production inAustralia and Northern Rhodesia.(/) Aluminium. The demand for aluminium in the world generally is likelyto increase greatly in the years ahead. At present almost the entireproduction of aluminium comes from the United States and canada and these countries are planning very great increases in production.The main requirement for the economic production of aluminium ischeap electric power. There is no prospect of substantial productionof aluminium in the sterling area in the next few years. In the longer term, however, it might make a most valuable contribution if thenecessary requirements for economic production can be satisfied. Thereare possibilities of production in the Volta River district of the gold coast, which are at present being investigated.(g) Steel. The need for increased &quot;production of steel, wherever this can bedone economically, needs no emphasis. Shortage of steel has in fact been one of the main limiting factors which has held up economic activity of all Sorts. There are particularly acute shortages of certain types of steel, notably heavy rolled products. Considerable expansionof steel capacity is planned in sterling area countries; this will need tobe balanced by a comparable effort to increase the supply of steel-making materials.(h) Fertilisers. A shortage of fertiliser is a major obstruction to the progressof agricultural expansion programmes. Countries throughout the sterling area are expanding the production of fertilisers and the develop-ments which are planned should go some way towards meetingincreased demands. Much greater quantities of fertiliser could, how-ever, be profitably used. Increased output of fertilisers which would need to be accompanied by intensive education of farmers in the valueof their use, undoubtedly offers one of the best prospects of acceleratingproduction of food and other crops, which is so vital to the sterling area.In all plans for increased fertiliser production account must be taken of the shortage of elemental sulphur.(i) Engineering Products-Ths expansion of production of engineering products, especially in the United Kingdom, is important for threereasons.   In the first place, these products are fundamental to the
development plans of the whole sterling area. Secondly, engineeringgoods constitute one of the most promising exports to North Americaand other non-sterling areas.* Thirdly, the sterling area spent in 1951over $400 million on imports of machinery and vehicles from the UnitedStates. The demand for many types of engineering goods from theUnited Kingdom is at present greater than the industry can supply.The industry, particularly its capital goods sector, is generally speakingfully competitive as regards price and quality, though at present forcertain types of goods it is sometimes unable to meet the delivery datesasked for. It is unable in all cases to quote firm prices. Its most urgent need is an assurance of increased supplies of steel so that existingcapacity can be fully used. As regards the future, provided capital investment continues to expand in so many parts of the world and sufficient supplies of steel can be secured, there is every prospect of a continuing and expanding market for engineering products. With theseprospects in view, expansion of capacity is already in hand in manysectors of the industry.21. There are in addition three fields in which shortages are at present limiting the pace of development throughout the sterling area.   These are:  (a) Transport Facilities which are necessary to permit goods alreadyproduced or capable of production to be marketed or utilised.(b) Power Supplies an essential pre-requisite for the full exploitation of available resources.(c) Irrigation and Water Supplies essential for the development of foodproduction and other crops.The Committee have been greatly impressed by the degree to which these shortagesare holding up desirable development.22. Transport Facilities. Throughout the sterling area development isimpeded by shortage of transport facilities, As regards railway equipment, theUnited Kingdom locomotive and rolling-stock industry has been unable to meet all the requirements of other Commonwealth countries mainly because of shortageof steel, particularly of boiler plate/&quot; It is clear that the growing railway require-ments of the Commonwealth call for a major expansion of output of locomotives and rolling-stock in the United Kingdom.23. Power Supplies. An adequate supply of power is essential for practically all forms of development, and throughout the sterling area shortage of power isimpeding progress. Major extensions of. power supplies are being planned in all parts of the Commonwealth; one important limiting factor is the supply of generating plant. Exports of heavy electrical plant from the United Kingdomincreased from  32 million in 1945 to  43 million in 1951, but most of this increasewent to non-sterling destinations. But in view of its central importance in. pro-viding the basis and setting the whole pace of economic development in the sterling area as well as of its high potential earnings of non-sterling currency, this industryis one in which investment should produce great and far-reaching benefits to the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments.24. Irrigation and Water Supplies-lrv most Commonwealth countries theexpansion of food production is being impeded by lack of adequate water supply.Implementation of irrigation schemes and measures for conservation of water supplies will make possible a substantial increase in production of essential commodities.25. The list of possibilities set out in paragraph 20 to paragraph 24 above isnot exclusive. Some of its contents will be of direct interest to some Governments,some to others. The Committee believe, nevertheless, that it offers a promise of sound development and that, if the promise is fulfilled, the sterling area&apos;s balanceof payments will be greatly improved. The Committee, therefore, feel that itwould be most useful if all sterling Commonwealth Governments were to surveythe resources available for development in those fields and were to examine, as a* In 1951, the United States exported over $3,000 million of machinery and vehicles to these areas
matter of urgency, the possibility of intensifying development of goods and facilitieswithin the list, where they judge that this can be done economically and without interference with other production which might contribute towards the strengthening of the balance of payments. Certain forms of development, such as power facilities and transport, depend on Government initiative. Elsewhere, the part which governments can play in stimulating expansion will consist mainly in creatingfavourable economic conditions to encourage private enterprise to develop alongdesirable lines. Within fields chosen for development it is important to concentrate on the early completion of selected projects.VI. The Obstacles to Development26. In Section V an attempt has been made to identify a few of the mostpromising resources for development. Section III examined the fundamentalrequirements for creating the conditions which will enable and encourage sound economic development to proceed. This section examines some of the impedimentswhich may hold up development, even when desirable lines have been identifiedand economic conditions are such as to make development possible. The main problems are lack of concrete proposals, shortage of trained man-power, shortageof capital goods and finance.27. The first three of these may be dealt with fairly briefly. As to the first,it is felt that the lack of sound economic schemes worked out in adequate detailfor consideration by potential investors has been one of the main factors delaying the pace of advance. Action to remedy this is a matter for individual Goverh-ments. Much is already being done to overcome the shortage of trained man-power. Shortage of capital goods has been dealt with in Section V of this report.The fourth obstacle, finance, is the subject of the remainder of this section.28. It is clear that much the greater part of the finance for the developmentof the resources of sterling area countries must be raised domestically by thosecountries themselves. The part which financial policy can play in bringing aboutthe conditions in which productive investment can and will take place has been examined in Section III. The creation of such conditions and the taking of anyfurther steps (particularly internal financial policies which encourage saving forproductive investment), which will help to mobilise domestic capital for develop-ment, must be the first care of all sterling area countries.29. The only sterling source from which countries of the independent sterling area can hope to derive any significant external assistance to their development isthe United Kingdom. The extent to which the United Kingdom has been able,since the war, to contribute towards development in the sterling area and the strainto which the United Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments is at present subject, need notbe described in this report. Along with other members of the sterling area theUnited Kingdom is facing a stern task in dealing with its balance of payments problem and in taking the necessary internal measures to fit its economy to beviable in a world trading system freed from the present restrictions and obstacles.It already has very substantial overseas commitments in a number of fields, includingdefence, which require it to secure a substantial surplus on current account toenable it to meet its obligations. The Committee have, however, taken note ofthe statement by the United Kingdom delegation that, not only is there no intentionon the part of the United Kingdom Government to interfere with the existing facilities through which United Kingdom capital resources are made available tothe sterling area, but that, in the event of other Commonwealth Governmentsaccepting the need to make an intensive drive to promote development directed to the improvement of the balance of payments, the United Kingdom might consider making a special effort to contribute towards schemes of a suitablecharacter.30. The United Kingdom spokesman stressed that he had no authority to commit Ministers at this stage and that the practical possibilities would have tobe considered before any decision was come to. The Committee understand thatin the light of this report Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom may wish to give further consideration to this important question.31. Development on the scale and at the pace which seem essential cannot,however, be financed from the internal resources of the sterling area alone.  Some
supplementation must be looked for in the form of capital from outside the area.While there may be a certain.amount of investment from other sources, which willbe welcome and may well be highly effective in deciding the success of individual projects, the United States is the only possible external source of a sustained flow of investment of sufficient magnitude to affect the fortunes of the sterling area asa whole.32. Following a recommendation of the Commonwealth Working Party on development, a Working Party composed of representatives of CommonwealthEmbassies in Washington has been studying the problems of attracting UnitedStates investment to the sterling area. This Working Party has produced an interimreport which furnishes a great deal of material on these problems. The WashingtonWorking Party has been invited to resume its work, with a view to making recom-mendations which Ministers can consider before they meet in November; in themeantime it would not be appropriate to seek to anticipate their conclusions.33. The Committee have, however, considered the possibilities of removingthose obstacles to investment listed in the annex to the Interim Report of theCommonwealth Working Party, There are four types of restriction, each of whichis in force in at least some of the countries of the sterling area, which appear to constitute serious deterrents to the foreign investor.  They are:  (a) restrictions on the repatriation of capital (including capital gains);(b) control of the types of investment permitted;(c) requirements as to the participation of local capital in. enterprises started by foreign investment;(d) restrictions on the import of capital equipment.Some Commonwealth Governments feel that there are strong reasons for theexistence of these restrictions. It is suggested, however, that, in view of the partthey play in deterring the foreign investment which it is the aim of sterling area countries to attract, Governments should keep under review their regulations and practices to ensure that relaxations or modifications are made in them as soon as circumstances warrant.34. While everything possible should be done to attract United States private investment, it is clear that the sterling area cannot rely on this source for any largeor early flow of funds. The capital which it is hoped to obtain from the UnitedStates must consist in large part of funds provided directly by the United StatesGovernment or of funds made available through such agencies as the international bank for Reconstruction and Development or the Export-Import Bank.35. The volume of external finance which may be made available directly bythe United States Government is determined by the willingness of Congress to vote funds year by year, and at present there are no solid grounds on which the&apos;sterling area could plan the expansion of development in the expectation of anincreased flow of capital from this source. The possibility of obtaining morecapital than hitherto from the Export-Import Bank should be pursued. Admittedlythis Bank exists mainly for the furtherance of United States exports, and its loanstend to be tied to the purchase of United States goods to be carried in United Statesships. It has, nevertheless, made a few loans recently which have not been sotied, and it would be well to explore the possibilities of its extending this practice.In addition, when a development project requires the purchase of equipment whichmust in any event be obtained in the United States, there would seem to be a case for discovering whether the finance for these purchases could be made available from the substantial resources available to the Export-Import Bank. :36. The Committee recognises the value of the work which has been and isbeing done by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. TheBank&apos;s usefulness is not only as a source of capital, but also for the technical advice which its staff can provide at all stages of a development project. The extent towhich the Bank can assist development depends largely upon the countries con-cerned submitting firm and detailed development projects for its consideration.Sterling area Governments cau contribute notably to an increase in I.B..R.D.lending by pressing on with the preparation of concrete projects of the sort theBank can consider.
37. It is worth noting that the dollar funds at the disposal of the I.B.R.D. areat the moment furnished almost entirely by its issues in United States markets.In this way it is already acting as the main channel through which the funds avail-able from private or institutional United States investment can be directed to development in the sterling area. The view was expressed that the inability ofcertain Governments to authorise the Bank to make use of their contributions toits funds was a factor limiting the extent of its lending.38. The considerations in the preceding paragraphs are relevant in the con-text of present United States Government policies, but there is a further major issue involved in the consideration of United States investment in the sterling area,namely, the possibility that the United States should greatly increase their overseas investment as part of their contribution to solving the world dollar problem. TheCommittee have not examined this possibility, which raises issues of the greatest importance generally and outside the field of development, and would merelyrecord that it will have to form a most significant element in any general economicproposals which are put to the United States.VII. Conclusions39.   The Committee&apos;s conclusions are therefore:  (a) In the present circumstances of the sterling area it is necessary that allsterling area countries should concentrate intensively on the develop-ment of those resources which directly or indirectly contribute on aneconomic basis towards the improvement of the sterling area&apos;s balanceof payments subject to the qualifications in paragraph 4 (paragraphs-5).(b) To this end there must be strict restraint in all other calls on economic resources. The underlying requirement for obtaining this restraint and encouraging the right sort of development is a strict internal policy,supported by whatever powers of direct physical control may be atthe disposal of Governments (paragraphs 6-11).(c) Development could be much assisted by policies which would assurestability in the level of demand and of prices (paragraphs 12-14).(d) It is possible to identify a number of fields where accelerated developmentcould make a notable contribution to strengthening the sterling area&apos;balance of payments. Governments might examine as a matter of urgency the possibilities of intensifying efforts in these fields (paragraphs16-25).(e) Most of the finance for development must be raised domestically.   Theonly source of external assistance for sterling area countries within thearea is the United Kingdom. Development on the scale required willbe possible only if more capital is available from outside the sterling area.The only external source for capital on the necessary scale is the UnitedStates (paragraphs 28-31).(/) It is important to do whatever is possible to attract private United Statesinvestment and the Working Party in Washington has been invited tomake specific recommendations to this end. It is suggested that allsterling area Governments should strive to relax wherever possible the obstacles to United States and other non-sterling investment (paragraphs33 and 34).(g) The achievement of the I.B.R.D. is recognised, and it is suggested that all commonwealth Governments do all they can to strengthen its positionand to help it to expand its operations (paragraphs 36 and 37).London, S.W. 1,12th October, 1952.
ItCONFIDENTIALCopy No.  5g?C.E.C. (O) (52) 22 (Final)10th October, 1952COMMONWEALTH ECONOMIC CONFERENCEPreparatory Meeting of OfficialsREPORT ON COMMODITY policy a. General Principles1. The object of Commonwealth policies must be to seek to strengthen the economies of countries within the Commonwealth and thus to strengthen sterling.This applies equally in the field of commodity policy.2. Short-term fluctuations in the relationships between supply and demand inthe case of primary products may be expected to occur, as they have done both inthe years since the war and in the very different conditions prevailing before thewar. There is no reason to suppose that they will not equally occur in the con-ditions which the trade and finance proposals before the Conference are intendedto secure. Quite small fluctuations in the general level of purchasing power and of demand may induce substantial fluctuations in commodity prices and thus affectthe earning power of Commonwealth countries. Similarly, changes in supply, oreven reports of likely changes, may cause pronounced fluctuations with major economic consequences.3. By short-term fluctuations we do not mean day-to-day or seasonal changesin the market, but the fluctuations, to which primary commodities are particularlysubject, which, while not the result of a long-term trend, may well take place overa period of months or even years.4. Violent fluctuations are detrimental to the interests both of producers andof consumers in the Commonwealth and to the balance of payments of the sterling area. On the upswing they generate inflation and stimulate the growth of syntheticsubstitutes, and on the downswing they cause a sudden fall in the incomes of producing countries just when the increased internal income created by the upswingis causing a high demand for imports, with consequential effects on development programmes and standards of living.5. The external position of the Commonwealth as a whole is greatly affectedby the earnings from a comparatively small number of commodities. Thus violentfluctuations in trade in a relatively few primary commodities can have a seriouscumulative effect upon both the level and stability of the external trade of Com-commonwealth countries. Furthermore, they may bring about maldistribution of resources in individual countries.6. An aggravating feature of violent fluctuations in the prices of primarycommodities is that, until the movement spends itself, they are cumulative. an initial rise of price, or expectation of shortage, stimulates buying for stock or re-sale and also in some cases the withholding of supplies by producers and thus causes afurther rise; similarly, an initial fall may lead to a withdrawal of buyers and anurge on the part of producers to sell more quickly than they would otherwise havedone. The remedy must lie in securing greater steadiness in the flow of supplyand demand and confidence that extreme movements of price will not be allowedto occur. . . . , ,7. Especially in the case of commodities requiring heavy capital outlay and a relatively long period before a return on the initial investment can be expected,short-term price fluctuations tend to act as a deterrent to investment.8. Governments cannot, either by internal action or by international co-opera-tion, hold demand or prices rigidly at predetermined levels in face of a long-termtrend upwards or downwards. But there are various ways in which Governmentscan seek to moderate fluctuations in price caused by short-term disparities betweensupply and demand.
B. Methods(a) Stimulation of demand9. It is important that the world demand for the sterling area&apos;s primary products should be increased. This is partly a matter of encouraging research intonew uses and, when necessary, into improvements in quality and the removal of artificial impediments which still exist to their importation and use. But it is alsoa matter of the level and stability of prices. Prices should not be so high as toretard expansion of demand in the face of the competition of natural and syntheticproducts from other sources; they should also be stable enough to give confidence to manufacturers that such materials provide a sound basis for developing stablemarkets for the products made from them. This is particularly important wherenatural materials have to compete with synthetic products, for which relativelystable prices are maintained. Prices must also provide an adequate return to producers: indeed, if they do not, the expansion of production necessary to meet any stimulation of demand will not be forthcoming.(b) Long-term contractsLong-term contracts between the Governments of producing and consumingcountries have had a stabilising -effect in that they give an assurance of a steady flowbetween sellers and buyers. But, if both sides are to be satisfied with them, theprice cannot be rigidly fixed over a period of years, especially as it has to take intoaccount the interests both of producers and consumers. Their bilateral nature alsolimits their effectiveness, where there are numerous important producers, and wherethere are closely-established world market prices.But the future of the practice of State trading in commodities is very uncertain,so that neither the continuance nor the extension of the technique can be relied upon. However, it might be possible to develop the technique of a long-termguarantee by Governments and thus preserve some of the effects of governmentallong-term contract technique.Long-term contracts between private interests may similarly have a stabilisingeffect, and the encouragement by Governments of their use in particular cases should be studied.ic) Internal schemes for stabilising pricesStabilisation schemes, including price support schemes, in individual countries have been considered, but, while in certain circumstances they may have some effecton world markets, they cannot be regarded as making a major contribution to thesolution of the problem.(d) International commoditiy agreements the essence of an international commodity agreement is that it is designedto prevent prices falling below a certain point on a downward trend and to prevent them rising above :a certain point on an upward trend. These agreements, par tie u-larly -of the type incorporating a buffer stock, can in certain cases go far to securethe end in view, but they do not provide a universal solution. Each case mustbe considered separately owing to the very different conditions of production andtrade in different commodities, including different marketing techniques.There must be equal opportunity for both producers and consumers to fakepart in the framing and management of such agreements. Otherwise either pro-ducers or consumers, as the case might be, could take concerted action which mightbe very harmful to the interests of the other category. But this concept allowsof concerted action by producing countries to work out among themselves and bring forward for international discussion a scheme of commodity regulation. Methodsof securing finance for a buffer-stock scheme may differ as between producing andconsuming countries as well as between products. Problems of finance could arise which might in the aggregate prove formidable. On the other hand, if effective means could be found of checking violent .short-term movements in prices ofparticular commodities, it might thus ,be possible ;to avoid separate action by individual countries to support ;prices or sterilise the effects of an inflation. Suchindividual action might be more costly than international schemes, including bufferstock;schemes; it.-could.also be less effective. Commonwealth countries in the lightof the general trade and financial policies which, are being discussed at the Con-ference must clearly pay serious regard to these aspects of the matter when
considering any commodity agreement.. They must ,al&amp;o bear in mind the cost of taking ao action in cases where trade and production in either producing orconsuming countries are threatened with dislocation.(e) Emergency actionMuch time must in any case elapse before commodity agreements coiuld be negotiated and brought into existence to cover a major part of the sterling area&apos;sprimary products. In the interval, there may well be need for emergency actionto check the development of violent fluctuations, whether general or in one or twocommodities only. The technical problem would differ according to whether theemergency were one of rapidly developing shortage or one of price collapse andsurplus. We are agreed that, in either case, there would be -need to mobilise opinionwidely so as to secure rapid consideration of possible action by the Governmentsprincipally concerned, including that of the United States.C. Machinery(a) litter national commodity agreements10. There is no need at present to seek the formal amendment of the existing arrangements for negotiating international commodity agreements; these arrange-ments could be made to work reasonably quickly, given the will to do so on thepart of participating Governments. We do not, however, regard the existing arrangements as necessarily appropriate as a long-term solution and it may benecessary to consider at a later stage the relationship between international ;a!r,range-ments for commodity policy and other international institutions in the trade field-In any case, any attempt to amend these arrangements at the present time would lead to long and possibly unfruitful negotiations. The initiation of proposals fora commodity agreement should not, and need not in terms of Chapter VI of theHavana Charter, await the appearance of a &quot; burdensome surplus &quot; but can proceed in the case of any commodity inherently subject to violent fluctuations. We suggestthat efforts should be made to secure explicit acceptance of this view by the UnitedStates Administration.(b) Emergency arrangementsIt is not necessary to maintain in being an elaborate organisation to initiateemergency measures. Ail that is necessary is that it should be accepted that countries should be called together quickly when emergency conditions are seen to be arising, whether they arise out of shortages or surpluses, and that there shouldbe a recognised and established method for doing this. There should be a clear understanding among the leading Governments that some such body should becalled together rapidly when need arises; and it should be further considered whether, in order to secure adequate speed, the membership and means ofsummoning it should be settled in advance.D. Conclusions11. (i) There is no single road to the objective of evening out the demand and supply of primary commodities, and the circumstances of individual commodities-ties must largely determine both method and timing.(ii) Long-term governmental contract technique has been of assistance incertain cases; there is need for study of the means of adapting this to a transition from public to private trading. There is also need to study the possibility of encouraging the use of long-term contracts by private interests.(iii) The approach by way of commodity agreements, to which much time and thought has been devoted in the years since the war, has, in fact, as yet had littlepractical outcome. The short-term interests of producers, traders and consumersseldom coincide, at any rate in their own eyes, and the opportunities for gettingagreement on any particular commodity may be found to be fleeting. Nevertheless,Commonwealth Governments could, and should, take what steps are open to them on the lines set out in this report. The corollary of this is that before embarking on such negotiations Governments should be clear what degree of importance they attach to a successful outcome and to what extent they are prepared to shoulder thepossible financial burdens.
(iv) There is need for establishing in advance a procedure for calling countriestogether quickly to consider emergency action in the case of rapidly developingconditions of surplus or shortage.(v) In all these matters the position of the United States, owing to its importance as a consumer and also as a large producer of many commodities, iscentral. In.any approach which is to be made to the United States as a result ofthe present Commonwealth discussions, it would be useful if the assent of thatGovernment to the general principles set out in Section A of this report could beobtained. There are no specific arrangements which could flow from such assent,but, if a similarity of approach could be established, then it might be possible tosecure the assent of the United States to the propositions about machinery set outin Section C of this report and thus to speed up action in the case of a threatenedshortage or surplus.London, S.W. 1,10th October, 1952.

(52) 1 (Final)15th October, 1952COMMONWEALTH ECONOMIC CONFERENCEPreparatory Meeting of OfficialsREPORT ON FINANCE AND TRADEI. introduction. Commonwealth Finance Ministers, at the end of their meeting last January,issued a statement (Annex I) in which they gave their opinion that measures to stop the drain upon the sterling area reserves must form part of a long-term policydesigned to restore and maintain the full strength of sterling. The first step wasto ensure a sound internal economy with all possible measures to combat inflation.Exports and earning power must be increased. It would be necessary to develop the productive power of members of the sterling area, which would require the investment of substantial financial resources; after taking account of whateversterling area countries could themselves provide, resources would have to beobtained from overseas and this should be encouraged. Production of essentialraw materials within the sterling area would be greatly helped by regularity of purchase by countries outside the area. The general aims of the Finance ministers would best be achieved when the world wide trade of the sterling area was on a substantially higher level, when sterling was freely convertible into the main curren-cies of the world and when its position need no longer be supported by restrictionson imports. The recovery of the sterling area would not be complete until theconditions had been created in which sterling could become and remain convertible.Accordingly it was the definite objective of the Finance Ministers to make sterlingconvertible and to keep it so; it was intended to work towards that goal by pro-gressive steps aimed at creating the conditions under which convertibility could bereached and maintained.2. A primary object of the meeting in preparation for the commonwealth economic Conference has, therefore, been to seek a course leading to convertibility.The discussions have throughout been on the basis that no delegation has authorityto Commit their Government in regard to any of the matters under examination.II. Internal Financial and Economic policy. There was unanimous agreement on the necessity, whatever external finan-cial policy was followed, for adequate and appropriate internal policies. It was of fundamental importance to maintain such policies continuously, and not just at times of crisis, in order to attain and maintain a sound external position. It wasnecessary for all sterling area Governments so to conduct their internal affairs asto give the greatest possible support to the balance of payments, and enable each country to pay its way. The internal and external commitments of the economy,both for consumption and investment, must be kept within the resources available.Spending power must be curbed in order to limit the demand for imports and tomake available the resources necessary for production both for export and toreplace imports. If the sterling area was to be competitive in world markets the attack on inflation must be consistently maintained.
24. Convertibility is in itself no solution to the problem. Whatever external financial policy is adopted each country, must live within its resources. But, becauseof the international status of sterling, once it is made convertible it will be impossibleto retrace that step without most damaging results. Appropriate internal policies to maintain convertibility will be essential, perhaps involving measures designedto produce a transfer of resources; these might cause temporary unemploymentunless there was an adequate degree of mobility in the economy.5. However, it would be wrOng to believe that a country can escape thenecessity of adopting sound internal policies by maintaining its currency on aninconvertible basis. If sound and adequate internal policies are not followed, the pressure of excessive home demand will make it increasingly difficult to balance the external accounts and will lead to greater and greater reliance on import restrictions.These provide no basic solution to the problem: they are temporary palliativeswhich experience has shown are not even successful in preventing periodic exchangecrises. The internal measures resulting from a repetition of these crises may indeed be harsher and more disruptive than any measures deliberately undertaken andcontinuously maintained to contain the pressures on the internal economy.HI. Continuation of Present Policy: A Gradual Approach to Convertibility6. Consideration was given to the possibility of continuing the policies agreedupon at the Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting but in the meantime tomake no major change in the status of sterling. The essential policies would beinternal measures of the nature dealt with in Section II and the development of sterling area resources to improve the sterling area balance of payments. Tradeand payments among the O.E.E.C. and Commonwealth sterling area countries would be freed as soon as possible by concerted action; then exchange and import restrictions against dollar countries would be gradually reduced; and, finally, whenit was clear that dollar equilibrium had been established and could be maintainedwithout exchange or import restrictions, sterling would be made convertible bothboth for residents and non-residents of the sterling area. The external and internalpolicies of sterling area countries would be bent towards the achievement ofconvertibility. The speed of the advance would depend upon the effectiveness ofthose policies and the extent to which &quot; good creditor &quot; policies were followed bythe United States.7. Substantial objections were made against this course. In the first place:;the existing system set up wrong incentives which led to the mis-direction of resources; the longer this continued, the greater would be the distortion of the pattern of production and exports and the more difficult would be the inevitableultimate adjustments. Secondly, if repeated statements of intention were notfollowed by some action leading towards convertibility, confidence in sterling wouldbe increasingly, undermined. This would be bound to affect the flow of UnitedStates investment funds to the sterling area. Thirdly, the existing external financial, policy of inconvertibility without adequate reserves and at a fixed rate put sterlingconstantly at risk; it was impossible to insulate sterling from the pressures of the outside world which, without adequate reserves, it could not withstand. BecauseOf the recent succession of crises foreigners were increasingly unwilling to holdinconvertible sterling. Fourthly, the ingenuity of traders had already found, andwould continue increasingly to find, means of avoiding the controls, distortingdesirable channels of trade and in effect making sterling increasingly convertibleoutside the United Kingdom; thus sterling was already subject to some of thestrains, of convertibility without advantage. Continuation and expansion of thesecheap sterling transactions would lead to loss of legitimate business and undermine the exchange control on which the system rested. Lastly, to maintain the status quowould continue and aggravate the existing trade and payments difficulties with canada and the United States.8. Although on balance this course did not command general acceptance,it was urged by some delegations that, if the risks and difficulties of any alternativeaction were thought to be too great, it would be a practicable course, despite the considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, to maintain the presentstatus of sterling and move gradually towards convertibility, particularly if thiswas accompanied by vigorous action to maintain adequate internal policies and todevelop the internal resources of the sterling area.
9. A possible further means of giving effect to this policy of a gradualapproach was suggested and examined. This was that the European payments union should be extended to the United States and Canada. A possible schemeand a summary of the discussions is set out on Annex II. It was not possible tofind solutions for all the technical problems arising from the scheme. Moreover,it was considered that it would not in practice promote a rapid advance towardsconvertibility and was therefore open to the objections set out in paragraph above.10.   No other scheme of this kind was put forward in discussion.^ 11. The United Kingdom delegation put forward proposals for discussion.These were that, at an early date, there should be initiated a plan of collectiveaction with other countries including a definite programme which would provideboth for a further measure of convertibility and for significant progress towardsfreeing trade. These proposals are set out in Annex III. The objective wouldbe that a group of countries whose currencies were of major importance to inter-national trade should enter upon discussions designed to lead to a multilateraltrading and convertible financial system. The course of action put forward in theproposals was:  (a) an exchange fund to support convertibility;(b) a concerted plan for the progressive removal of quantative import restrictions, subject to continuing discrimination against a persistentcreditor and to a strict emergency &quot; escape clause &quot;;(c) the adoption of &quot; good creditor &quot; policies by the United States;(d) modification of I.M.F. and G.A.T.T. to conform with the new policies;(e) convertibility, at a flexible rate into any currency, of newly-acquired sterling in the hands of non-residents and convertibility of currencies of othercountries in the group where they were not at present convertible.12. An advantage of this proposal would be the extension of the concept of major trading nations working together to free trade and payments from restriction.In addition the plan would provide for continuing discussions on trade and financial problems between the countries concerned and would bring the United States into consultation as a full partner. Its active help, by providing substantial&apos;dollar resources to support convertibility, would be an essential feature.13. Discussion took place on the question whether present conditions wouldbe suitable for an operation of this sort and comparison was drawn with conditionsin 1947. It was felt that in any such comparison there were both favourable andunfavourable factors. Those suggesting a more favourable position to-day than in1947, and, therefore, a greater sense of confidence in a convertibility operation,were:  (a) the improved external position of sterling.(i) In 1947 the United Kingdom and the sterling area were in heavyover-all and dollar deficit on external account * whereas therewas now a balance, if a precarious one.(ii) The volume of sterling balances in the hands of non-residents of the sterling area was now much less than it had been in 1947;(b) a new convertibility operation would be undertaken at a date and in a manner of the United Kingdom&apos;s own choosing, whereas the date forconvertibility in 1947 was not the United Kingdom&apos;s choice and, under international commitments, had to be at a fixed rate of exchange;* The United Kingdom had an over-all deficit on external account of nearly  550 million in1947 and the sterling area deficit with the rest of the world was  900 million. In the first halfof 1947, the period before the convertibility operation, the sterling area had a dollar deficit at anannual rate of nearly $4,000 million. The United States had a current balance of payments surplus in 1947 of $11,500 million.IV. A Collective Approach to Convertibility
(c) the physical recovery of the sterling area.(i) In 1947 the United Kingdom was still suffering from the effects ofthe fuel crisis of that year. Not only did this lead to an actualshortage of goods for export, but there was considerable appre-hension about the United Kingdom&apos;s future export position.(ii) Since 1947 there had been considerable physical recovery throughoutthe sterling area from the effects of the war. In the UnitedKingdom industrial production stood at 30 per cent, and agricul-tural production at 15 per cent, above the 1947 figures. Thevolume of United Kingdom exports was now 50 per cent, higherthan it was in 1947;(d) there had been since 1947 a remarkable advance in the methods ofeconomic co-operation, including progress in international organisationssuch as O.E.E.C. and within the Commonwealth itself;(e) the great advances in United States economic policy since 1945 suggestedthat there would be a readiness in the United States to considereconomic problems with an open mind.14. On the other hand, there were a number of difficulties which were greaternow than in 1947; (a) The reserves were much lower.   They stood to-day at just below$1,700 million. In 1947 they were $2,400 million and there remainedavailable over $2,000 million from United States and Canadian lines of credit. Moreover, the purchasing power of the dollar was now lower than in 1947.(b) The burden of defence expenditure had increased and would continue tobe a very major and real problem for the United Kingdom. The defence programme tended to impinge upon those sectors of the economy whichwere most important in the field of exports.(c) No more &quot; economic cushions &quot; remained, such as the lines of credit andthe E.R.P. aid. United States assistance was now directed towardsmilitary expenditure and, with the exception of Point IV, was notdirected to the general support of the economy.(d) Sterling had passed through three crises at approximately two-yearly intervals, and this was bound to have an effect on opinion overseas andat home on the probable success of a convertibility operation.(e) The world generally was moving towards a period of much greater com-petitiveness, the competition of Japan and Germany in export marketsbeing of particular significance.V. Main Considerations Arising on the Collective Approach15. Discussion centred around five aspects of the proposed collectiveapproach:  (a) Only non-resident sterling was to be made convertible at the first stage.(b) The proposal for a flexible rate.(c) The arrangements suggested for the progressive removal of quantitative restrictions, coupled with the future discrimination proposals.(d) New political institutions arising from the collective approach.(e) The proposals regarding preference.Convertibility Limited to Nonresidents16. It was pointed out that in many Commonwealth countries, apart fromother questions, the presentation of the scheme to the public would be difficult.There was a public expectation that convertibility would mean easement of restric-tions on dollar expenditure; it would be said that this scheme offered none andthat it gave advantages to non-residents which were denied to residents of the sterling area. It was also suggested that, if through the adoption of adequateinternal policies sterling area exports became more competitive and the sterling area as a whole had a policy of achieving external balance, there would be no appreciable additional strain either on the reserves or the rate if future sterling
earnings were made convertible for residents as well as non-residents. A further questions raised was whether, if sterling were convertible only for non-residents,a sterling area country might not derive advantage by being outside the area.17. It was pointed out by the United Kingdom delegation that residents ofall parts of the sterling area could already be said to have convertibility in the limited sense that their sterling was already convertible into any other currency,for purposes approved by their own controls within mutually agreed policies. Theproposal to make newly earned non-resident sterling convertible was designed toserve the interests of the sterling area as a whole and not as a method of givingdollars to non-residents. The strength of sterling was judged by the esteem inwhich it was held by non-residents. In its own interests sterling must be acceptable,and this meant acceptable to persons whose goods sterling countries needed to buy. It was necessary that such non-sterling countries and suppliers should notonly be prepared to sell their goods for sterling but that traders and bankersshould be willing to hold working balances in sterling instead of converting it immediately into dollars or any other currency. Convertibility for non-residentswas the essential first step towards the full objective of convertibility both forresidents and for non-residents. If the essential first step was successfully taken, an increasing freedom for sterling countries to spend in any part of the world attheir own choice would follow of itself, provided that their policies were of theright sort. But this whole process could be jeopardised if at the outset there were added to convertibility for non-residents too great a freedom for residents of the sterling area to spend their sterling in the dollar world.18. It had been suggested that convertibility should be given to residentsbefore giving it to non-residents. In the view of the United Kingdom delegationsuch a policy would weaken sterling in the eyes of non-residents and would be most damaging to sterling as an international currency. The United kingdom delegation stated that convertibility for United Kingdom residents would be impracticable at present and, if convertibility were allowed to residents of other sterling area countries, it would be necessary to establish exchange control betweenthe United Kingdom and those sterling area countries. This would be a con-siderable extra burden on the controls both in the United Kingdom and in theother sterling area countries and might endanger the present sterling area arrange-ments. The flow of capital to the rest of the sterling area would have to be strictlycontrolled and this would be disadvantageous to sterling area countries who were dependent on the United Kingdom for short-term finance for trade and for capital for development.19. The United Kingdom delegation suggested that the following considera-tions would need to be borne in mind by any sterling area country when consideringthe desirability of remaining in the sterling area.(a) Until there was complete abolition of quantitative restrictions, members ofthe sterling area would enjoy a greater freedom of trade inter se than if they were ouside the area.(b) All countries faced ups and downs in their trade relations and for thesethey needed reserves. There was great advantage in the arrangements of the sterling area for the pooling of reserves.(c) There was freedom for capital movements within the sterling area, and itwas not intended to change this. It would be necessary for a sterling area country, before leaving the area, to consider carefully whether itwould be able to obtain as easily in other markets short-term finance for trade and capital for long-term purposes.(d) Once external sterling became convertible, sterling would become a muchmore acceptable currency, because it would be more useful; its advan-tages as a reserve currency would, therefore, be increased.20. Nevertheless, the opinion of delegations remained divided on thedesirability of limiting convertibility in the first instance to sterling in the hands ofnon-residents. Some were of the view that convertibility for residents should besimultaneous with that for non-residents. Others, however, felt that, if such action were not considered practicable, some modification of the proposals should be madeto make them more attractive. It was suggested that this might appropriately takethe form of an alleviation of the present discrimination against dollar expenditure.This is dealt with in paragraph 31 below.
A Flexible Rate I21. The adoption of a flexible rate for sterling was criticised by some delega-tions on the following grounds: i (a) The plan presupposed a fixed rate between each sterling currency and sterling. Sterling area countries would be free to decide what that rate should be; but, once that decision was taken, subsequent movements inthe sterling rate would not necessarily conform to the needs of their individual economies. Though they would, of course, always be free to change their parities with sterling, frequent changes could causedifficulties for them and might perhaps impair confidence in their currencies.(b) A flexible rate might have serious disadvantages for countries who wereproducers of primary commodities because, in so far as their exports were inelastic, there would be no expansion of exports if the rate fell to compensate for any fall in their external price; moreover, the internal economy would be disturbed by the higher internal cost of essential imports, which in certain cases were also inelastic, and by any higherinternal price of exports. Thus the result of these factors might be to divert resources which it had been intended to devote to development.(c) There might be danger of retaliation against any depreciation of the rate and this might lead to an exchange rate war.(d) There were grounds for fearing the effect of a depreciation in the rate uponexport earnings, which might fall and thus increase the balance of pay-ments gap.(e) A flexible rate might offer a tempting escape from the full rigours of astrict internal policy.(/) In present circumstances a flexible exchange rate would not be an effectiveequilibrating mechanism. The present rigidity of the economies of the sterling area, their tight control of imports and their high level ofemployment made it unlikey that any advantages, either from automaticreduction of imports or stimulation of exports in the volumes needed,would follow any fall of the rate.(g) A flexible rate would strike at the very heart of the exchange ratephilosophy of the International Monetary Fund and would thereforecause substantial difficulties in connection with sterling area drawingrights from the I.M.F. and borrowing from the International Bank.(h) Sterling area countries held their reserves in the form of sterling and, witha flexible rate, the value of these reserves and the cost of servicingnon-sterling loans would fluctuate.(i) A flexible rate might lead to instability of prices and affect the volume of world trade.22. There was a difference of opinion on the effect of a flexible rate ascompared with a fixed rate on the movements of capital. On the one hand,there was apprehension lest it should discourage the flow of investment capital and encourage speculative capital movements. On the other hand, the Canadianexperience (which, however, might not be entirely relevant since the Canadiandollar had generally been appreciating since the flexible rate was introduced) hadbeen that the flexible rate had discouraged movement of speculative capital withoutaffecting adversely the flow of investment capital.23. The United Kingdom delegation explained that the major objective ofexchange rate policy was stability, which clearly was in the best interests of allconcerned:  (a) Important and essential elements in the scheme were designed to achieve this, but it was felt that it was neither practicable nor wise, even withthe other safeguards, to make sterling convertible as proposed at a fixedrate. Flexibility was essential to the scheme and any other methodmight force a series of devaluations from one fixed rate to anotherwhich would be the worst possible course.(b) A major advantage of a flexible rate was that it offered a choice; temporarydisequilibrium could be dealt with either by using or building up the reserves or by allowing the rate to move up or down-or by a combination of both these. A fixed rate offered no such choice. Allthe pressures were concentrated on the weakest link the reserves.
(c) The ideal would be that there should be only small fluctuations in the rate.The funds that were available in the form of reserves or exchange support would be used to iron out temporary fluctuations.(d) Whatever policies the United States Government might follow, allowance would have to be made in sudden and temporary changes in the UnitedStates economy which, even if quite small in themselves, would be reflected much more severely in the smaller economy of the UnitedKingdom. A flexible rate would give some protection against such temporary changes. It would mobilise the price mechanism in supportof Government measures by making imports dearer at times when itwas desirable to reduce them. It would also provide for automaticreadjustment of the rate to the changed circumstances when the UnitedStates economy recovered and thus reduce to a minimum the period during which the economies of other countries were disturbed by theeffects of the changes in the United States economy.24. The United Kingdom delegation emphasised that it was necessary toconsider the larger movements which would be the result of more permanent trends in the trading relationships between the sterling area and the rest of the world and of other factors which would affect the exchange rate. The extent of suchmovements would depend largely on the extent to which each and every country of the sterling area pursued appropriate internal policies. Basically it must berecognised that the primary responsibility would rest upon the members of the sterling area themselves. It would be the greatest mistake to think that stability,apart from stability in the sense of ironing out temporary fluctuations, should besecured by the use of the reserves or any exchange fund rather than by the use ofthe appropriate policies. Therefore, while the objective would be stability, and while the intention would be to keep fluctuations within reasonable margins in orderto protect the trade and the economies of the whole sterling area from the dangersand inconveniences of instability, there would certainly be no intention of estab-lishing a range of a fixed amount above or below the present parity within whichthe dollar/sterling rate would be held, come what might. The major trends inthe sterling area&apos;s relationship with the rest of the world would have to be reflected in the movement of the rate. Whether or not the movement was favourable would depend primarily on the efforts of all the members throughout the sterling area.Quantitative Restrictions and Discrimination25. It was explained by the United Kingdom delegation that the proposalsfor the progressive removal, subject only to an emergency &quot; escape clause,&quot; of allquantitative restrictions applied under the balance of payments clause of G.A.T.T.were made because, under conditions of convertibility, it would be of the greatest importance to open and preserve markets for sterling area exports in order to absorbas much convertible sterling as possible. Thus it would be advantageous to movequickly towards the multilateral free trading and financial world, which was theultimate objective. Meanwhile, however, it would be essential for countries to be free to discriminate against imports from a persistent creditor, that is to say-broadly speaking a country which regularly had a surplus on current balance ofpayments account without investing this surplus abroad or otherwise covering it by appropriate means. If there were to be no discrimination against importsfrom the United States then, so long as that country continued to be a persistentcreditor, the United States surplus would depress the sterling rate. It would therefore, be necessary in the view.of the United Kingdom delegation to have formalprovision authorising the right to discriminate.26. These proposals were criticised by a number of delegations. Appre-hension was expressed lest a substantial elimination of quantitative restrictions should expose some countries to great risks, if they were faced with serious balanceof payments difficulties which would call for urgent corrective action only possiblein the form of physical limitation of imports. If their reserves were not great, theproposed strict emergency &quot; escape clause &quot; might operate too late to protect them.Some sterling area countries would derive no reciprocal advantage from the elimination of quantitative restrictions because their exports were inelastic and theywere not, in general, suffering from import restrictions in other countries.27. Further, delegations from some countries with substantial development programmes felt that they needed import restrictions, in addition to all other means at their disposal, to ensure that their available resources of foreign exchange were
used to buy the imports required for their development programmes and were not*squandered on luxury goods. It was thought that in the circumstances of someof these countries it might be impossible to maintain the desired pattern of imports by internal means alone. Thus the removal of quantitative restrictions would limit their development programmes. It was further pointed out that bilateral trade agreements had enabled some countries to obtain supplies of scarce goods and encourage and diversify their exports.28. It was pointed out by the United Kingdom delegation that so far as these objections to the proposed progressive reduction of quantitative restrictions were concerned it was not indispensable to the scheme that sterling area countries should reduce these as rapidly as might be necessary for the United Kingdom. , There wasno overriding difficulty in their moving at a speed more suited to their owneconomies.29. A number of delegations questioned whether it would be practicable tosecure, under conditions of convertibility, that countries should discriminate against a persistent creditor. There would be less incentive for both non-sterling and sterling area countries for such discrimination if sterling were convertible.It would, therefore, be essential to keep sterling area exports fully competitive bythe strict internal policies already mentioned.30. It was urged by a number of delegations that the proposed right to discriminate against a persistent creditor would tend to isolate the United Statesand would certainly jeopardise the chances of getting United States agreement tothe collective approach. It by no means followed that it was entirely the fault ofthe United States that it was a persistent creditor: this might be due to a greater or lesser extent to inflationary conditions in other countries which exaggerated theneed for dollar goods, restricted the volume of exports to the dollar area ordiscouraged the flow of investment funds from the United States. Further, theproposal to bring to an end discrimination against Canada (who would not be apersistent creditor) at a relatively late stage in the programme would prolong theisolation of Canada, in trade and finance matters, from the rest of theCommonwealth and would do so without any justification of principle.31. It was suggested by a number of delegations that some earlier move toreduce discrimination against dollar countries might not only make United states support more probable but might also help to make the proposals more acceptablein sterling area countries by offering something to sterling area residents at thesame time as convertibility was given to non-residents. Various courses were suggested. Either discrimination against Canadian imports could be removed atthe outset or a start could be made by removing the discrimination against partof the imports from Canada. At the very least, it should be possible to begin todismantle discrimination in the early stages of the operation. It was by no means certain that the initial shock of this would be very significant and there were strong reasons of principle for beginning to make a move in this direction. As regards theproposal relating to discrimination against a persistent creditor it was suggestedthat while there should be no provision giving an automatic right so to discriminate,it would be reasonable to make provision to permit such discrimination if theUnited States remained a persistent creditor for reasons quite clearly connectedwith its own domestic policies, and if, after consultation, discrimination was thought to be an appropriate remedy.Procedural and Institutional Arrangements32.   There were three elements to this problem:  (a) It would be desirable that the United Kingdom should not act alone or only with the Commonwealth and the United States but should move in concert with certain major trading nations in the approach toconvertibility.lb) Some form of exchange fund would be essential to the convertibilityoperation and there were the questions of how the fund should beestablished and used.(c) There was a need for some sort of forum, in which the United States would participate as a full member with both rights and obligations, whichwould give an opportunity for continuing discussion of the problems
connected with the establishment and maintenance of a multilateralworld trade and payments system. Discussion would be more fruitfulin a body with positive functions and for this reason a proposal wasmade that the body vested with the supervision of the exchange fund should have these more general functions.33. It was thought that the procedure proposed under (a) of the previous paragraph was the right course. It would be necessary to ensure parallel consulta-tion with the sterling Commonwealth as the negotiations leading up to the convertibility operation proceeded. The second point (b) was more difficult; itwas thought that some Commonwealth countries would be unable to agree thatthe exchange fund should be managed by a small group of countries consistingof the United Kingdom, United States, Canada and some Western european countries, since such an arrangement would be regarded as a form of interferencewith the internal economies of nations not directly represented in the group dealingwith the exchange fund. A difficulty in both the second and third points in theprevious paragraph was the concept of a body to manage the exchange fund and act as a forum for discussion. Such a body, though created by agreement betweenonly a small group of countries, would inevitably take over some of the basic workfor which the more broadly based I.M.F. and G.A.T.T. were founded. although there had been some disappointment in the operation of these two institutionsit would be preferable to try to work through them, thus avoiding the political- difficulties that might arise if they appeared to be bypassed.34. To meet these points an alternative course was suggested and, althoughit was appreciated that it was not free from substantial difficulties, a number of delegations thought that it would be a helpful way out. Broadly it would involve:  (a) the use of resources already in I.M.F., possibly by the provision of some special standby credits to countries undertaking convertibility opera-tions. No doubt periodic examination of a borrowing country&apos;s positionwould have to be accepted but this would have to be combined with provisions to ensure that the standby credits were genuinely and readily available;(b) if these resources were inadequate, further bilateral credit arrangements might be made. The I.M.F. itself had borrowing rights which mightbe used to increase the support funds available;(c) the availability of I.M.F. standby funds would have to be free from any limitation under present I.M.F. rules regarding fluctuating exchange rates and drawing rights;(d) with an automatic standby credit there would be no question of day-to-day management;(e) a joint committee might be set up by I.M.F. and G.A.T.T. to be the pro-posed forum for discussion.of the whole complex of finance, trade andassociated problems. This would be a co-ordinating body where there could be a confrontation of debtor and creditor and discussions ofboth commercial and monetary policies. An advantage of using sucha committee rather than the small group originally proposed wouldbe that, in addition to the major trading countries joining in the collec-tive approach, it would include representatives of the major geographical areas and would thus be less exclusive;(f) the new committee might have the function of dealing with the operationof any balance of payments emergency &quot; escape clause &quot; in G.A.T.T.and might also supervise the liberalisation programme.Imperial Preference35. It was explained that the proposal regarding imperial, preference, whichin many parts of the Commonwealth is called &quot; Intra-Commonwealth Preference,&quot;formed part of the United Kingdom scheme because it was considered to offer scope for strengthening and developing the economic ties of the Commonwealth and because, under the present &quot; no new preference&quot; rule, of G,A.T.T., Common-wealth countries would be unable, as the need arose, to increase their tariffs onforeign goods without, at the same time, increasing their preferential tariffs on commonwealth goods. This had not greatly mattered in the past when importshad been more affected by quantitative restrictions than by tariffs but, in the context43047-5 c
of the proposal for the progressive removal of such restrictions, tariffs and prefer-ences: would become the normal method of regulating trade. The difficultiesaffected the United Kingdom tariff with particular force because the UnitedKingdom generally exempted Commonwealth goods from duty.36. All delegations, except the United Kingdom delegation, considered thatto make the proposals relating to imperial preference an integral part of a collectiveapproach to convertibility would be untimely and inadvisable. Four main reasonswere advanced, although there were different views on the weight to be attached tothe last two of them.(a) The inclusion of proposals on preference would make it much moredifficult to obtain the United States support essential to the convertibilityscheme.(b) The United Kingdom proposals raised political issues on which opinionwithin the Commonwealth was sharply divided.(c) There was a serious risk that, if freedom to extend imperial preferencewere gained, there might be tendencies among other countries toestablish preferential areas of their own. The net result might beharmful to the sterling area and retard the progress towards a multi-lateral trading world. It might thus be considered incompatible withthe convertibility proposals.(d) Even if freedom from the &quot; no new preference &quot; rule were obtained, itwas at least doubtful in present circumstances whether there was scope for mutual extensions of preference of any significant amount.37. It was recognised that the &quot; no new preference &quot; rule might cause difh\culties for certain Commonwealth countries in regard to specific rates of duties which needed revision (e.g., because of changes in. prices) and that it causeddifficulties in certain parts of the United Kingdom tariff because Commonwealthgoods were generally exempted from duty. But many delegations felt that, whileit might be possible to obtain some relief for these special difficulties, it wouldbe undesirable to seek a general abolition of the &quot; no new preference &quot; rule on thelines proposed by the United Kingdom delegation, even if this were to be soughtquite separately from the proposed collective approach.VI. The Proposals as a Whole38. Before any collective approach could be initiated, a judgment wouldhave to be made on the proposals taken as a whole in the light of discussions withinthe Commonwealth. If this judgment were favourable, discussions would begin with countries whose co-operatiOn would be needed for the collective approach.Commonwealth Governments would be fully consulted throughout such discussions and in particular on any revisions which might be suggested in the course of them.In the&apos;end a decision would have to be made, having regard to the progress madeunder each part of the proposals (including the position as regards internal financial measures), on whether the balance of risk would be such as to justify the introductionof convertibility.39. The general view was that the present proposals, taken as a whole, hadsubstantial merit and constituted an imaginative and constructive approach to theproblem. However, important features of the proposals gave rise to difficultieswhich for certain delegations were of a serious nature. These have been discussed at some length in this report.London, S.W. 1,15th October, 1952.
ANNEX conference OF COMMONWEALTH FINANCE ministers statement at End of ConferenceFollowing their discussions in London from 15th to 21st January, 1952, theConference of Commonwealth Finance Ministers issue the following statement: -we recognise that the sterling area is faced with a very serious crisis which,if it is not effectively dealt with, will have farrreaching consequences. The crisishas arisen because the sterling area as a whole is spending more than it is earning,with the result that its gold and dollar reserves have been falling at a rapid rate.2. We are confident that this situation can be set right, and that the steps which will be taken will give to sterling the strength it must have to continue as awidely-used international currency.3. We are convinced that this cannot be attained by negative and restrictivemethods alone, or merely by the imposition of cuts on imports from certain partsOf the world. The present difficulties of the sterling area, while partly due to short-term factors, also reflect continuing underlying problems. These problems mustand can be solved. For this reason we are strongly of the opinion that measures taken to stop the drain upon reserves must form part of a long-term policy designedto restore and maintain the full strength of sterling.1 4. It is quite clear that the only way to prevent recurrent drains on the centralgold reserves is for every country in the area strenuously to endeavour to live withinthe means which are, or can be, available to it. The sterling area as a whole mustsucceed in this endeavour.... .......5. The urgency of the immediate situation, and &quot;the present level of the gold reserves, require that the sterling area as a whole should be in balance with therest of the world at latest in respect of the second half Of 1952. It is imperative that this should include at least a balance with the dollar area within the sameperiod.n   z\;icuis(y;q z&amp;i :h\ - 6;;;-iv.s: v. zonh    -.; %coi ^     zM* -,.6. . During the course of our discussions the Finance Ministers and representa-tives of the Commonwealth countries in the sterling area agreed to bring urgentlyto the attention of their Governments the critical nature of the present situationand the need for immediate corrective action. In this connection they will put before their Governments certain definite proposals calculated in the aggregate toensure that the sterling area as a whole will be in balance with the rest of the world in respect of the second half of 1952. Proposals to the same end will be recom-mended by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governments of the territories with which he is concerned.7. It was also agreed that, where any country in the sterling area was likelyto be in overall deficit, corrective measures should be taken as soon as possible,in order to relieve the current pressure on the resources of the area.&apos; 8. The methods by which members will contribute to these ends are withinthe discretion of each country concerned and will vary according to their individualcircumstances. The first, and most important, step is to ensure that the internal economy is sound and that ah possible measures are taken to combat inflation.This is not only essential for an improvement in the balance of payments, but itwill also help to keep down the cost of living. Another important requirement isto increase exports and earning power. In some cases long-term borrowing from outside the sterling area may be practicable. Finally, so far as other methodsdo not fully achieve the desired results, it will be necessary, as a temporary measure,to reduce imports.43047-5 . .  d
9. It was agreed that, while emergency measures to stop the immediate drainupon the gold reserves were necessary and inevitable, they could only be palliatives.A lasting solution of the sterling area&apos;s problems must be found in order to preventthe recurrence of crises, to make sterling strong and to establish the economies of member countries on a sound and stable basis.10. These aims can best be achieved when the world-wide trade of the sterling area is on a substantially higher level than at present, when sterling is freely con-vertible into all the main currencies of the world and its position need no longer be supported by restrictions on imports. When this state of affairs has been reachedthe countries of the sterling area will have freer access to the output of north america and other important regions and to adequate resources of external capital for development.11. It is accordingly necessary that for some years to come the sterling area should be in surplus with the rest of the world (including a surplus With the dollar area), and that, after taking account of available sterling assets and long-terminvestment from abroad, all member countries should balance their externalaccounts. ,    ,12. To do this in the face of the need for national security and higher,standards of living clearly requires the maximum possible expansion of earningpower. By the development of their productive power members of the sterling area will not only strengthen their own economies but will also help to meet the inevitablygrowing world demand for food, raw materials and other essential goods.13. Such development will require the investment of substantial financial resources, and it is clear that, after taking account of whatever they themselvesCan provide, it will be necessary for many member countries to obtain thoseresources from overseas. For some time to come the Commonwealth will not beable to meet its growing needs entirely from its own resources, and developing countries will therefore need to rely in varying degrees on investment from outsidethe sterling area. We are agreed that such investment is to be welcomed, and thatall necessary steps should be taken to encourage it.14. We feel that the production of essential raw materials within the sterling1area would be greatly encouraged by regularity in purchases of such materials by countries outside the area, as this would contribute materially to the long-termstability of the area and, indeed, of the free world as a whole.15. We are also agreed that an examination should be made as quickly aspossible of the opportunities for an early increase in the productive power of member countries and of the possibilities of matching available financial, andtechnical resources with the enterprises most likely to achieve that purpose. this examination should take account not only of the general development requirementsof member countries and of their need for capital equipment, but also of the possi-bilities of increasing their production of food, raw materials.and other essential goods.16.   We have made arrangements for such an examination to begin forthwith.Ill17. While steps are thus being taken to overcome the immediate problemsof the sterling area and to accelerate its development, we agree that its recoverywill not be complete until the conditions have been created in which sterling canbecome and, remain convertible.18. Accordingly it is our definite objective to make sterling convertible andto keep it so. We intend to work towards that goal by&apos; progressive steps aimed at creating the conditions under which convertibility can be reached and maintained.:19. , It is primarily the responsibility of the members of the sterling area&apos;themselves to create these conditions (including the achievement of adequate gold reserves); but they cannot be completely realised without the active co-operationof other countries, notably those countries which are consistently in surplus withthe rest of the world.
20. We have arranged for an investigation of the steps which should be takenalong the road to convertibility to begin forthwith.IV21. We reaffirm the need for frequent and comprehensive consultation between governments within the Commonwealth on the problems of the sterling area. Inparticular, steps will be taken within the next few months and from time to timeto review progress on the measures now being taken and proposed.London, S.W. 1.ANNEX IIAN EXTENDED PAYMENTS UNION1. As an alternative to the collective approach to convertibility and as apossible means of providing for a gradual approach to convertibility and non-discrimination, a suggestion was made that the European Payments Union shouldbe extended to the United States and Canada. It was put forward by those whofelt that the dangers of early convertibility with a flexible rate were very great andwho therefore emphasised how damaging it would be if a convertibility operationhad later to be reversed. The object of an extended payments system would be three-fold:  (a) to provide an earnest of good intentions; if there were no apparent progress to the declared objectives within a reasonable time, confidence iurepeatedly expressed intentions would be lost;(b) to set up machinery to allow gradual progress towards convertibility and soavoid the dangers of a &quot; plunge &quot;;(c) to obtain as many of the advantages of the collective approach as waspossible without running the risks of convertibility.2.   The following would be a possible scheme:  (a) There would be established a Payments Union, on lines similar to E.P.U.,which covered the whole transactions of the sterling area; it would include, inaddition to the present members of E.P.U., the United States and Canada.(b) As with E.P.U., the Union would operate within an organisation where themembers would, among other things, observe rules for the conduct of trade between themselves. The main rule would be that any member would be entitledto discriminate against a persistent creditor, but apart from that there would be no discrimination save within currency areas.(c) On the whole it seemed best that the other sterling area countries shouldbe associated with both the organisation and the Union through the UnitedKingdom in the same way as they^were now associated with E.P.U.(d) As in E.P.U., there would be provision for interim finance between members, with monthly settlements of such transactions by gold payments and bycredit, within members&apos; quotas.(e) In addition, to provide incentives to correct disequilibrium with a persistentcreditor, each country would pay a &quot; gold tax &quot; to the Union on its bilateral deficitwith such a creditor or receive a &quot;gold bonus &quot; from the Union on its bilateralsurplus with such a creditor. Thus a country would pay a larger proportion ofgold in settlement of deficits with the United States than on its. overall deficit.(/) There would be no change in the status of sterling, which would remain&quot; inconvertible &quot; at a fixed rate.3.   The advantages claimed for such a scheme were:  (a) It would provide a,forum within which the general economic problems ofmembers could be discussed and, in particular, the. problem of the lack of balance between the United States and the rest of the world. Such discussions would haveextra point and precision, as compared with present opportunities of discussion,in that they would be based on regular monthly financial settlements of the payments position of all members, including the United States.
1.4(b) The scheme would be a step forward towards multilateral trade and payments. The monetary incentives to discriminate described in paragraph 2(e)above would be gradually reduced by the modification of the different terms onwhich credits were granted to cover deficits in the various currencies. When therewas complete equality of the terms on which credit was granted, convertibility and non-discrimination against the dollar would virtually have-been achieved. the speed of this process would depend largely on factors such as the application Ofinternal financial measures, the development of resources within particular countries, the strengthening of the balance of payments of members and theadoption of &quot; good creditor &quot; policies by the United States. No doubt the speedwould be influenced by the effectiveness of the discussion in the &quot; forum &quot; in pro-ducing changes in policy. There would be pressure within the forum to speed upthe pace of the advance. Thus the scheme would avoid the danger of a &quot; plunge &quot;.It would provide machinery to ensure that convertibility was achieved as soon asthe measures needed to make it safe had been adopted.4.   There appeared on analysis to be some difficulties and objections to sucha scheme:  (a) It,was difficult for convertible and inconvertible currencies to be: in apayments union together. .   , ,(i) &quot; Non-convertible &quot; members would have an interest in accumulatihg&apos;   ; v hidden reserves of convertible currencies and pro tanto allowing their normal debit in the Union to be increased or their normal credit to bereduced.  For these reasons there would be a tendency for the quota &apos;of the main &quot; convertible &quot; country to be rapidly exhausted, with a... .     .   resulting break-down of the Union. , ..(ii). A further difficult question would be whether all members&apos;.transactions(whether with other members or not) in any currency, of a member of. v.   ,  ...   the Union should be brought into account with the Union (which might in some circumstances subject the Union to considerable strain) orwhether members&apos;, transactions with third countries, even if in the currency of a member, should be excluded (which would require anextension of the United Kingdom exchange control to control inwardpayments of dollars and would seriously interfere with the present rulesabout transferability of sterling),(iii) Whatever the decision on the question posed in.(ii) above the only certainmethod of meeting the risk inferred to in (i), above that reserves pfconvertible currencies, and particularly of the dollar, would be built up. outside the Union-would be for the United States to impose the-&apos;-necessary exchange control in order to see that all dollar receiptsproperly accountable within the Union were included and all dollarpayments which were not so accountable were excluded.; (iv) It might be possible, theoretically, to adopt measures which would&apos; minimise the danger of the credit facilities of the Union being used to accumulate hidden reserves of convertible currencies outside the Union.If this were practicable the adoption of exchange control by the UnitedStates would probably not be necessary, at least on other members&apos;account.  The technique would be to make credit given in the Union: by. the United States very hard compared with that given by other, countries. Thus the period of United States credit could be shorter, therate of interest higher, and the proportion Of gold to credit in thesettlement of deficits with the United States could be increased. the supporters. Of the scheme suggested that such arrangements to make:    -drawings of United States dollars from the Union would ensure thatthey were not wasted and thus, incidentally, reduce American opposi-tion to the scheme.(v) If this technique were adopted, however, there would have to be separateaccounts for transactions with the United States and for those withother members. Hence the possibility of offsetting surpluses under oneof these heads against deficits on the other would be limited, though no more than at present. This would not apply if the terms of all creditswere as hard as those granted to coyer deficits with the United States;but in that case all incentive to discrimihatiofi against the latter would,.,  have disappeared.&apos;
(vi) It might still be that the United States, in its. own interest of avoiding givingexcessive credit, would still feel that an exchange control would benecessary. &apos; &quot; . &quot; .., ,(b) The position of Canada would be very difficult. It appeared that-therewould be three courses open to her. Either she would have to impose an exchange control (thus abandoning convertibility of the&apos; Canadian dollar at least for non-residents) in order to prevent other members from financing their United Statesdeficits by drawing on Canada, which was thought to be impracticable;. or she would have to accept serious and unpredictable pressures on her economy as aresult of such financing; or she would have to become merely a member withouta quota, neither borrowing nor lending within the Union.(cj It was thought that the United States might find acceptance of the schemedifficult. Since one of the objectives of the scheme was to make Canada arid theUnited States full partners, the difficulty which both Canada and the United states would find in joining was thought to be a decisive factor against its adoption.(d) The gold tax referred to in paragraph 2 (e) would be an incentive to all members to seek to pass on to others the gold tax properly due on their own deficitswith the United States. Thus, foreign Governments might well encourage their nationals to export sterling area raw materials to the United States and so increasethe gold tax payable by the United Kingdom. This danger, however, already existed in substantially the same form and would not be made worse by such apayments union. &apos; .(e) The necessary arrangements would be very complex indeed and thepolitical difficulties of presentation would be considerable. On the other hand,the supporters of the scheme pointed out that complex schemes had been madeto work in Europe. Moreover, while discussion leading up to a payments union would necessarily be complex, the scheme finally agreed might, in essence, be relatively simple. vo&apos;(/). Because of the difficulty of having convertible and inconvertible currenciesin the same Union, sterling could not be made convertible without the UnitedKingdom running the same risks as Canada, and probably having to leave theUnion. In the meantime the Union would do nothing to strengthen sterling. Onthe other hand, the supporters of the scheme pointed out that when it became safe to make sterling convertible it might be appropriate to wind up the Union.(g) It was doubted whether the scheme would in practice promote a rapidadvance towards convertibility. It was thought, therefore, to be open to all theobjections to the proposed gradual approach to convertibility set out in paragraph 7of the report to which this note is annexed. ..  \London, S.W. I.annex iii . ;r-;&apos;:THE &quot;COLLECTIVE APPROACH &quot; TO CONVERTIBILITY1. This note sets out the general lines of a course of action leading toconvertibility, as indicated by the delegation in the initial discussion. This doesnot represent any cut-and-dried plan; it is an illustrative working-out of a possible course of action which would, in the United Kingdom delegation^ view, help tostrengthen sterling and to create favourable conditions for the success of anyconvertibility operation. This paper does not, however, set out the advantages orthe difficulties of this particular course. . They will no doubt be brought out in our discussions. &apos; ;2. In this note &quot; convertibility of sterling&quot; means that all sterling newlyacquired bynOn-residents of&apos;the sterling area after the date of the operation wouldbe fully convertible, at a dollar-sterling rate with considerably wider margins thanthose which are now ruling.    &quot; -       .- ; * -:   ....3. The note assumes-as is essential for all plans for convertibility and indeedfor maintaining sterling inconvertible without crisis-that all sterling area countries
take effective action, both in internal and external policy, to keep the sterling area&apos;balance of payments with the rest of the world in a strong-and healthy condition,and in particular:  (a) a tight hold on credit;(b) policies on investment and domestic consumption which check imports and leave room for a volume of exports adequate to give the sterling areas current balance of payments surplus with the rest of the world;(c) within these policies, a plan of sound development of a nature which willin the long run improve the balance of payments of all sterling area countries and strengthen their competitive power.4. Given adequate policies by the sterling area countries themselves, thereare three main dangers in a convertibility operation:  (a) the inadequacy of gold reserves to maintain the desirable degree ofexchange rate stability in a world economy which is subject to widefluctuations;(b) the danger that other countries by imposing import restrictions againststerling area exports and by discriminatory exchange practices, will seek to build up sterling surpluses for conversion into dollars;(c) the danger that the &quot;world dollar problem &quot;-i.e., the United Statesbalance of payments surplus, unmatched by long-term investment will continue, creating a hunger for dollars which would greatly add tothe dangers under (73).5. The more effective the policies of the sterling area countries themselves,the less would these dangers be, but the dangers would still exist whatever the policies of the sterling area countries. It is suggested that the most effective way to overcome these dangers is by a &quot; collective approachr&apos; of certain importantcountries towards this whole series of problems. If such a &quot; collective approach &quot;could be organised, it would greatly reduce the risks of any convertibility operation.6. We should therefore envisage as the first step in the process an agreementbetween the United Kingdom, France, Holland, Belgium, the United States and,we hope Canada. At a somewhat later stage we might seek to add Germany to this small group. In this group effective discussion could take place on major economic matters including the world dollar problem. The group would be the prime moversin initiating and following through a comprehensive programme of action to bringabout and maintain an effectively working multilateral trading and financial system,including the following:  (a) an exchange fund, provided by the United States, to support the con-vertibility operation;(b) a concerted plan for reducing, and then removing quantitative import restrictions by as many countries as possible, subject to continuingdiscrimination against persistent creditors;(c) adoption of &quot; good creditor &quot; policies by the United States;id) modification of I.M.F. and G.A.T.T. to accord with changes in exchange rate and import restrictions policy, to deal with tariffs and preferencesin the light of the changed situation on import restrictions, to modify the management in a manner which would provide for a more positiveco-operation to tackle the practical world economic problems and topromote common action by creditor and debtor countries to secure and maintain a better balance in the world economy;&quot;(e) convertibility of sterling and the currencies Of the European countries mentioned.7. In this programme, (a) is directed against the danger in paragraph 4 (a)above; (b) and id) are directed against the dangers in paragraph 4 (b) and (c) above;(c) is directed against the danger in paragraph 4 (c) above.8. The precise order of events under this programme, after agreement hadbeen reached between the initial group of countries, cannot yet be laid down.But in the United Kingdom view all these matters go together and any decision onany move to convertibility would need to be taken in the light of the progress made under each of them. It would be necessary to judge any convertibilityoperation in the light of the extent to which the risks in paragraph 4 above hadbeen overcome.
9. The initial agreement between the group of countries referred to inparagraph 6 would thus provide for an agreed course of action over the whole range of currency and trade policy designed to bring about and maintain a satis-factorily working multilateral system, with convertible currencies and expandingproduction and trade.10. The detailed arrangements under each head would have to be worked out in negotiation. The following indicates the sort of procedure which mightemerge.11. Convertibility. The decisive action is that on sterling, for this is the onlyreal international non-dollar currency. Consequently, the timing and operationalarrangements would have to be kept in United Kingdom hands. There would be provision for simultaneous action by France, Belgium and Holland, and also byGermany if by this time she had been brought into the group.12. Exchange Fund. This would be a fund to support the convertibility ofthe currencies just mentioned; it would be managed by the initial group referredto in paragraph 6.13. Import Restrictions. The procedure for the reduction and removal of quantitative restrictions could be as follows. The United Kingdom and other european members of the group, supported by the United States, Canada and, itis hoped, independent members of the sterling area, would initiate a programmeof agreed steps to reduce and ultimately remove restrictions between O.E.E.C.countries both among themselves and also, reciprocally, with the independentsterling area. This would be followed by a corresponding move to negotiate similarreciprocal removal of restrictions with other non-dollar countries.14. This action would clear the way for a modification of G.A.T.T. designedto eliminate quantitative import restrictions with the following exceptions:  (i) quantitative restrictions for other than balance of payments reasons, tothe extent now permitted under G.A.T.T.;(ii) a very strict emergency clause;(iii) restrictions permitted against a persistent creditor.At this stage, of course, it would be obligatory on countries to remove restrictions,within the above rules, on imports from Canada.15. It would be essential to secure at the outset that the United Kingdomand the other sterling area countries would be free in the process of removingimport restrictions to adjust their tariffs and preferences without the restraint ofthe &quot; no new preference &quot; rule of G.A.T.T.16. &quot; Good Creditor &quot; Policies by the United States. It is hoped that this programme of advance to convertibility and the removal of import restrictions would strengthen the forces in the United States which are pressing for a more liberal commercial policy, and that it would be possible within this general contextto obtain undertakings of effective action, e.g., on tariffs, &quot; Buy American&quot;legislation, shipping, commodity policy, &amp;c.17. Modification of I.M.F. and G.A.T.T. The essential elements in thiswould be:  (a) the new rules for import restrictions;(b) revision of the &quot; no new preference &quot; rule;(c) adaptation of I.M.F. practices to conform with the new exchange situationand to provide adequate short-term credit facilities for the countrieswhich would not have access to the exchange fund;(d) adaptation of governing structure and management to provide for more positive co-operation on practical problems.London, S.W.
