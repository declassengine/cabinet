C(74) 27 COPY NOS April 1974CABINETNATIONAL INSURANCE bill memorandum by the Lord President of the council. I was asked to look into the scope which the Opposition might have for raising during the passage of the National Insurance Bill thepossibility of a proposal for six-monthly uprating s, and the steps open tothe Government to prevent this.2.        Questions of the selection of amendments and the range of debatefinally rest with the Speaker and the House authorities, in accordance withthe procedures of the House,    What is said hereafter, therefore, must be read as subject to that overriding consideration.3.        The likeliest potential ground for any ruling that an amendment, or extended reference, relating to a proposal for six-monthly uprating was outof order would be that it raised the question of public expenditure outsidethe scope of the relevant Money Resolution.    This Resolution has alreadybeen tabled.    Briefly, the argument would run that the administrativeprocedures for more frequent rerating cost public money, and theexpenditure of this money is not covered by the terms of paragraphs 4 or 5of the Resolution.    I understand that Parliamentary Counsels view is thatthis argument is likely to hold in relation to paragraph 5, but wouldprobably not hold in relation to paragraph 4 of the Money Resolution.4.        A further potential loophole is that a Member might simply table an amendment to section 5(3)(a) of the Bill proposing that the date of paymentof the uprated allowances should be brought forward from July 1975 to, say,May 1975*   It seems likely that such an amendment would provide theopportunity, if desired, for the debate of the general principle of six-monthly uprating s.5.        Finally, there is the possibility that the Speaker would allowdiscussion of this issue in the debate on Clause 5 stand part, particularly if he thought the Government had been unduly hasty in the Parliamentaryhandling of the Bill.
6. The first two of these loopholes could possibly be closed by thewithdrawal and replacement, suitably amended, of the Money Resolution.  :But this would highlight the differences between the two Money Resolutions,and since a Money Resolution is debatable, the opposition that might otherwise focus on an amendment relating directly or indirectly to six-monthly reviews could then foeus on the Money Resolution,    Furthermore,there would still be the risk that the issue would be raised on Clause 5stand part,7. On balance, therefore, there seems little that we can do to avoid the possibility of the issue of six-monthly reviews being raised in one way or another on the Bill.    If we do try to narrow the range of possibilities,we may simply increase the likelihood of attention being directed to theissue.E privy Council Office8 April 1974
