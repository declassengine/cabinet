NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS AFTER APRIL 1975Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. The conclusion reached in C(74) 24 was in favour of dropping thereserve scheme, provided that some method could be found of avoidingunacceptable contribution increases for the lower paid in April 1975.    Ihave examined this problem with the Paymaster General and with his agreement propose the following solution.2. The uniform percentage contribution for men and women employeeswould be 5j per cent from April 1975.    This is the same as the standard rate which will be charged on earnings over  9 from August for our forth-coming uprating.    (The flat rate contribution will stop in April 1975).3. The attached table shows the comparison between the employees&apos;contributions which will be payable on this arrangement from August 1974and April 1975 respectively.    It will be seen that all men, and all women who are not contracted out, would be paying less except at the highestearnings levels (over about  60 per week).    Women who have beencontracted out would pay the same rates as other employees, but theywould have increases because at present they pay lower contributions than others on two counts: because they are women, and because they arecontracted out.4.        This level of employees&apos; contributions would imply an increase inemployers1 contributions of about 1^ per cent over the levels set in the1973 Act (raising their total to 8f per cent).    Employers would be paying 100 to  150 million a year more than if the contribution burden were divided between employees and. employers in precisely the proportions ofthe 1973 Act.    The exact amounts of the employers1 contributions will depend on further actuarial work.    Legislation to make these changes willbe needed before the Summer Recess.    I shall be discussing this further with the Lord President of the Council, as agreed by Cabinet on 4 April(CC(74) 8th Conclusions, Minute 5).    (I understand that the contributionchanges could not be effected by way of amendment to the national insurance Bill, now before Parliament).1C(74) 29 COPY NO       7 99 April 1974.   j] .,. ..... .CABINET
