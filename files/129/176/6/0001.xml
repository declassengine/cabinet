C(74) 31 COPY NO /26 April 1974CABINETOVERHAUL OF CHILEAN aero engines BYROLLS-ROYCE (1971) LTDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for industry, I was asked to circulate a paper on the overhaul by Rolls-Royce(1971) Ltd (RR(71)) of Avon aero engines for the Chilean Air Force Hunters(CC(74) 9th Conclusions, Minute 5).THE PRESENT CASE2. This overhaul work for Chile, which has an annual turnover of about 400, 000, is carried out at RR(71)&apos;s East Kilbride factory, and providesabout 5 per cent of that factory&apos;s turnover and 0.1 per cent of the company&apos;soverall turnover.    RR(71) also now sell about  10, 000 worth a year of spares for these engines to the Chileans.    If as I am recommending these contracts are ended it is unlikely that there would be any redundancies;  intime there might perhaps be some small reduction in overall employmentthough this is far from certain.    The Export Credits Guarantee department are at risk for some  4 million if the Chileans should fail to pay thebalance of the original purchase price of the Hunters.3,        RR(71) is at present contractually committed to accept Avons fromChile for overhaul, though the contract provides that this obligation can be terminated after the company has given three months&apos; notice.    Thecompany is contractually committed to supply spare parts, and there is nobreak clause.    At present, the company hold eight engines from Chile foroverhaul, but work in them has been stopped since the end of March, whenthey were blacked by the workers at East Kilbride,    It appears that two more engines are on their way to East Kilbride from Chile.    RR(71) needexport licences to return overhauled engines (which are Chilean propertythroughout) to Chile.    At present they have only *ix licences, applicationsfor two more are pending and can be stopped.4.        If RR(71) ceased to overhaul these engines, the Chileans would perhaps be able eventually to make other arrangements, though this wouldtake some time and could mean that some at least of the planes would be unable to fly in the interim.1
5, The Hunter is the front line Chilean strike aircraft and moreimmediately relevant to their border dispute with Peru.    Nonetheless, theHunters could undoubtedly be used in a counter insurgency role and indeedattacked the Presidential Palace in the coup, which led to the overthrow of president Allende^ Government.BROADER CONSIDERATIONS6. The arguments for and against the continuation of these contracts,as compared with the ,warship6 though superficially similar are significantlydifferent in these important respects:1. The size of the contracts are far smaller,2.        The repercussive effects on British interests of cancellingthem will accordingly be less.3. The employment consequences in the United Kingdom are nota large enough factor to be considered.4. The repair work is at present being stopped by industrial action officially supported and the end of such action i&amp; not in sight,5.        Engines for aircraft that were actually used in the coup atthe Presidential Palace and can be used internally against forcesseeking to restore democracy will be rightly seen as offering muchmore direct military help to the Junta.6. There are no Chilean forces now controlling these engines,comparable to the Chilean sailors aboard the warships.7, The sale of the warships revealed the widespread anxiety inthe Labour Party which would be likely to be renewed and extendedif these overhauls and the supply of spares continued.8,        The Scottish Trades Union Congress at its RothesayConference condemned all sales and have endorsed the presentaction of the workers.recommendation.        I therefore recommend to my colleagues that:-i. I should be authorised to tell RR(71) that they should notify the Chilean Government that they are not able to continue either the engine overhauls or to supply further spares,ii. The engines with RR(71) or in transit should be returnedunoverhauled.iii. If necessary this decision should be enforced by refusing,cancelling or modifying export licences.A W BDepartment of Industry26 April 1974. 2
