CABINETEEC ENERGY policy note by the Secretary of State for Energy1. The Ministerial Committee on Energy recently considered the attached paper on the attitude we should adopt towards the formation of a commonenergy policy within the European Economic Community (e.c.).    The paperrecommends a future course of action which, while not obstructing reasonableprogress by the Community towards a common energy policy, shouldprejudice neither our negotiating objectives nor our North Sea interests.2.        The Committee approved the proposals but invited me, in view ofthe importance of the issues involved, to report them to the Cabinet.E G V Department of Energy7 May 1974C(74) 38 COPY NO    817 May 1974
background the Summit meetings of October 1972 in Paris and December 1973in Copenhagen agreed general expressions of intent to work towards a Community energy policy.   Very little practical progress has beenmade.2    The UK has probably little to gain from any likely Communitypolicy since we could be self-supporting, or near self-supporting,in energy by the 1980s;   in any case some of the main questions -oil supplies, and the monetary and economic problems arising fromhigh oil prices - must be pursued in a wider grquping with USA and japan, and collaboration in the nuclear field can be arranged on a bilateral basis if we want it.   The advantages of an e.c. policy areas yet unproven;   but there is the potential disadvantage that itmight somehow limit our freedom of action on North Sea oil and gas.3    However, we shall incur ill-will and mistrust if we block allprogress towards a Community energy policy and this could reflecton progress in the wider re-negotiation objectives.   We are alreadytarred with the same brush as France because action during the recentcrisis gave rise to the view that HMG were following a nationalisticline (in fact, the limited extra quantities of crude oil we got werenot at the expense of other member countries, and we went no further than others in cutting exports of products).   Apart from France andthe Netherlands, the other member countries lack major oil companies and feel, without understanding the situation clearly, that the multi-nationals including Shell and BP give them a raw deal, on both prices and supply.This paper therefore explores ways in which we can co-operate(without disadvantage, and possibly with some limited advantage, toour own interests.CURRENT IDEAS5     The Commission has recently tabled a new strategy paper in the eec committee of energy officials;    it is summarised with briefcomments at Annex.   The paper will be discussed in the committee on6 May before the Commission submit it to the Council of Ministers,Perhaps at the meeting in June.ANNEX
CONFIDENTIAL .    .    ,6      In most aspects, other than oil, the Commission^ views are unlikely to cause us major difficulties.   On oil, however, they have long believed that Europe can benefit from a controlled oil market,and that the Commission should exercise that control.7      In our view, some surveillance of oil imports and exports, of companies&apos; forward plans, of oil prices and of profits would be use-ful;   but we should not give big new powers to the Commission to do this, firstly because we doubt their competence and secondly because we do not want to cede powers over our oil supplies and pricing policy to an international body.UK LINE8      Our energy policy towards Europe should be guided by the objectives:-(a) to preserve the national advantages of our strong futureenergy position.    (Measures to protect our essential North Seaoil and gas interests, and the extent to which we can achieve this within the terms of the Treaty of Rome, are being dealtwith in separate papers).(b) to continue support of the wider Energy Co-ordinating Groupset up at the Washington Conference (e.c. countries, less France,plus US, Canada, Japan and Norway), dealing with the majoraspects of world oil supply policy, relations with oil producers,and. arrangements for sharing dil supplies in emergency.(c) to co-operate in evolving appropriate European policies which, however, should be administered nationally unless thereare real advantages in creating new powers for the Commission orfor a new agency.9 In practice, this will mean that we should not refuse to partici-pate in work directed towards:-(a) national surveillance of oil imports, exports and prices in accordance with general principles agreed by the Community,and with limited central collection of information by theCommission (other member States will want this);(b) collaborating to increase coal and nuclear supplies(including supplies of nuclear fuel);(c) studies of other Community energy objectives, for exampleschemes for a closer alignment of energy prices, for conservation,for energy R&amp;D, and for encouraging the development of alter-native sources of oil;(d) study of the prospects for developing Community economic,trade and financial relations with oil producers.10     But we should seek to reject:-(a)   Community and Commission control over oil policy and overthe activities of the oil companies;   while it will be necessaryto concede a bigger role for the national oil companies inGermany, Italy etc, we do not want to see the position of Shellor BP weakened;
(b)   the creation of a new European energy agency, unless anduntil the case for one has been clearly demonstrated (theCommission have proposed a new agency under their control, andthe French have proposed an independent agency).We shall come under pressure to study joint Community action in any new oil crisis, covering oil stocks, conservation and equitablesharing of the oil which Europe now imports from the Middle East and africa,   we can argue that this should be subsumed in a wider andmore effective scheme including America;   but, if such a scheme fail to materialise, European arrangements might be in our interest,provided we can avoid an implied commitment of North Sea supplieswhen these start to flow.RECOMMENDATION11    UK representatives should be guided by the views in paragraphs to 10 above in the forthcoming discussions of Community policy,with due regard for the need to protect our North Sea oil and gasinterests,   and should also have in mind the-Government&apos;s overallintention to re-negotiate the terms of entry to e.c..E.V.Department of Energy30 April 1974--     confidential
ANNEXCOMMISSION PAPERCOMMUNITY&apos;TOWARDS A NEW ENERGY POLICY STRATEGY FOR THEfOOTLINE AND PRELIMINARY COMMENTSThe Commission paper outlines a coherent Community energy strategy and objectives for the medium and long terms (ie for 1985 and 2000).The overall analysis of 1985 objectives is supported by more detailed proposals for supply policies governing each source of energy.I MEDIUM AND LONG TERM OBJECTIVES(i) for 2000The strategic objective for 2000 is an energy economy in which nuclear energy and natural gas would account for 50% and 30% respectively oftotal Community energy requirements with dependence on oil and coalconsequently limited to only 20% of total Community requirements.(ii) for 1985The following table summarises Community medium-term energy objectives in comparison with earlier proposals:-Share of each fuel in total CommunitySupply (oT&quot;Solid fuelsOilNatural gasHydro-electricNuclear energyIn197324.458.512.72.91.5In 1985(as estimatedat beginningof 1973)10.561.416.12.49.6 in.1985(as nowproposed)1738.52517.5The Commission conclude that energy &quot;independence&apos; cannot be achieved in the medium term but that the proportion of imported energy in total consumption could be reduced from the current level of 60% to 40%,with &quot;high risk&quot; supplies reduced to a maximum of 25% of the total1985 energy balance sheet (compared with the earlier estimate of 50%).COMMENTIn its concern with security of supply, to the neglect of all butperfunctory consideration of prices, plant-building capacity, andthe economic cost of the attainment of the Commission targets, thereis a large element of wishful thinking in the 1985 objectives.   TheCommission paper is notably optimistic on supplies of both nuclear energy and natural gas.   However, the fundamental aims are obviouslyright, and targets can be reviewed periodically in the light of developments.
INDIVIDUAL FUELS(i) Nuclear energy the proposed target for 1985 of 200 Gigawatts is some 50% higherlthe previous estimate used in Community discussions.   Even alloliBfor some acceleration - and the French have recently increased tBtarget - we regard the objective of 200 Gigawatts as unrealisticBdoes not take account of industrial capacity which at present isl-sufficient to make this possible;   nor does it take account of oconstraints (the necessary time taken in planning, overcoming eelmental and political objections, overcoming design defects should&apos;appear and, in the case of the UK, in choosing a suitable reacto&apos;system).   Costs have not been calculated (but the Commission has promised to incorporate a hew chapter on this).Another doubt is on the availability of uranium ore to meet the Ienlarged programme.   There is doubtless sufficient ore in the gjibut are the supply countries likely to adopt a similar attitud-the 1980s as the Arabs in the 1970s in relation to oil?(ii) ElectricityThe Commission suggest that the construction of new oil-fired baload plant should not be authorised unless exceptional reasons Mand that the use of natural gas in power stations should be strifllimited.   The Commission have followed up these suggestions by tilspecific proposals for directives on these two points.While the Commissions thinking accords broadly with the Governtljpresent policy on the fuelling of power stations and might be acceptable as general guidance for the present, the acceptance oilthese as long-term obligations would prevent the Government adopt!a more flexible policy on the use of these fuels should this bedesirable in the light of the future availability of North Sea ga Iand oil.(iii) CoalThe Commission propose that up to 1985 coal production should he jmaintained at least at its present level of 250m metric tons/ami Iwith imports increased to 30 to 60m tons/annum.   There should herationalisation of productive capacity supported where necessary by Community financing, improved manpower policies, a free-market price policy, and more Community-financed R&amp;D related to productivity.   Consumption should be supported by guaranteed long-term contracts, construction of more coal-fired power stations and mofiR &amp; D on new uses.    Security of imports should be improved by \long&apos;term contracts and Community investment in third country products and stockpiling should be encouraged.This is an ambitious programme though broadly in line with our owaims and most of it is expressed in general enough terms to beunobjectionable.   Community financing might be useful for us, hut&apos;shall need to watch that, if we do accept Community financing, wedo not incur export obligations which we might prefer to avoid.(iv) Natural GasThe Commission propose as an objective that by 1985 natural gas sKprovide one quarter of the Community&apos; s total energy requirements,2
instead of the 16% shown in their earlier forecast.    They aim to:1       increase the supply of natural gas by:-(a) administrative/fiscal measures and Community aidprojects to encourage Continental Shelf exploration;(b) free trade within the Community for gas;(c) joint action to promote imports from third countries;2 .,    enlarge and integrate the gas-transport system within theCommunity by:-(a) regulations for gas pipelines;(b) study of increased investment in gas-transport;3      achieve optimum economic use of gas by:-(a) regulations strictly limiting use in new power stations and reducing use in existing stations;(b) wider use of interruptible contracts for large-scaleindustrial users;(c) a Community system of harmonised prices and tariffsfor consumers.The proposal at 1(b) does no more than state what is already in theTreaty; but, if given undue prominence as a new policy, it mightthreaten our control oveir new supplies of gas from the UK continental shelf.(v)      OilThis section of the Commission paper is markedly different from theremainder.   In other sections the Commission is mainly concerned withbroad strategic considerations.   On oil, the Commission renewsearlier, detailed proposals for an &quot;orderly Community oil market&quot;,that is for an oil market in which the oil companies would comply withcertain rules of behaviour laid down by the public authorities (aphrase which may imply Commission control), who would supervise their application and could intervene where necessary.A major weakness of this section of the paper, little of which wecould accept as it now stands, is its neglect of the interface betweenthe Community and the world energy scene and the failure to acknow-ledge the limitations imposed on the Community by the internationalnature of the oil market.The Commission paper contains detailed proposals on:-(i) a common supply policy.(ii) a common Community price system.(iii) co-ordination of oil company investment programmes.(iV)     Community support for research and exploration.&apos; confidential
On supply policy, the Commission proposals envisage the elaboratioJ&quot;between companxes and Community authorities of a community &apos; supply [plan&apos;.    This is unrealistic, since supply depends very largely onfactors outside Community control.   Each member state will in anycase be supervising supply to their own markets.This is not to say that the Community should not do what it can, wjother international organisations, to ensure security of supply,particularly in times of shortage.   However, the earlier Commissioilproposals referred to in the paper, would not resolve Communitysupply difficulties.   An OECD-wide scheme offers the best prospectlThe Commission calls for the provision of a mass of detailedstatistics. While we are prepared to provide summaries of informal!including short-term forecasts the detailed proposals need study a:justification.On price policy, the Commission proposals also need further examinjtioin   Crude prices to various Community members will not be identjand product prices within member states will inevitably reflect tlCurrent selling prices also, of course, reflect widely differingnational taxation pollcied.   We can however agree that the Communifshould work towards *pried transparency&apos; - ie the collection and publication of oil product prices as a step towards harmonisation.jThe idea of Community support for research and development isadmirable in principle if realistic programmes are adopted:   wewould need to watch carefully proposals relating to North Seaexploration.conclusions in its final conclusions, the Commission reiterates the need to reinforce the objectives with Community action in for example E &amp;!and oil exploration. It mentions the possibility of a legally andlfinancially autonomous energy agency (but unlike the current Frenciproposal, this agency would be under the control of the Commission!30 April 19744
