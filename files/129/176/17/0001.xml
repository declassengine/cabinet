SALARIES AND ALLOWANCES OF MEMBERS OF parliament memorandum by the Lord President of the council. Concern about the erosion of the value of Parliamentary salaries and allowances has been growing among many Members for several months.Pressure on the Government to act, particularly in the field of allowances,has increased to the point where I consider we should review this matter assoon as possible.2.        The current emoluments payable to Members of Parliament (MPs)are set out in the annex.    These rates were introduced from 1 January 1972(with the exception of the mileage allowance -which was fixed in November1970) following the special review undertaken by the Top Salaries review body (TSRB) under the chairmanship of Lord Boyle who submitted the reportto the Government in November 1971.    On the subject of future reviews, the review Body said the following (paragraph 123):&quot;We have commeated earlier on the relative infrequency ofreviews of the remuneration of Members of Parliament and ministers in the past and the difficulties to which this has given rise.    It has been most strongly represented to us that reviewsshould be more frequent or that some means should be found of ensuring automatic adjustment from time to time.    For our partwe consider that there should be a major comprehensive! re viewat intervals of four years ie corresponding roughly to once in the lifetime of each Parliament of normal length.    However, weshould not wish to exclude the possibility of an intermediateadjustment between major reviews&quot;,3,        I do not think that a general reference to the TSRB would be wise inthe present sensitive conditions.    Although the House had no doubt expectedearlier that a general reference would have followed an Election at the endof a Parliament of normal length, a full review of emoluments is probably not now expected.   A recent informal meeting of Labour Members chairedby Mr Michael English recommended that allowances should be reviewed butsalaries remain unchanged.    I think that the right course.1C(74) 42 COPY NO      8114 May 1974CABINET
4.        I therefore recommend that the TSRB be requested to conduct alimited review of Members&apos; allowances, leaving over the question ofMembers&apos; and Ministers&apos; salaries until perhaps later this year or early next year.    That would be consistent with the TSRB&apos;s recommendations about &quot;intermediate adjustments between major reviews&quot;, although itwould be limited to allowances only.    It would be desirable to time the reference to come after, or simultaneously with, the Government1 announcement on the recent TSRB Report.    But I think it essential that Ishould announce the reference before the Whitsun Recess.5.        I think it preferable that the TSRB should conduct this limitedreview rather than that the Government should do so,    Although the bases of some of the current Members&apos; allowances are controversial, I proposethat only their amounts should be reviewed on this occasion and that anywider questions about them should be left over to the next general review.Lord Boyle has told me informally that such a limited review would be acceptable to his Review Body.6. Presentation both to Members and the general public will need careful thought.    The reference of allowances is unlikely to be controversial.But we shall need to explain why we are not referring pay or even allowingMembers interim Stage 2 and Stage 3 adjustments.    Whilst we could point to the need to encourage pay restraint during the transition to a voluntarypolicy, this need is likely to be a continuing one.    We could say that it isnot yet four years since the last review, but that would imply that there could be no further review for a further 1^ years.    The general expectation that this will be a short Parliament could not easily be referred to.    invite my colleagues&apos; views on this aspect.7.        Any change in the House of Commons allowances is likely to increasethe pressure which already exists for an increase in the Peers&apos; dailyexpenses allowance which was fixed at  8. 50 from 1 January 1972.    this allowance is related to the Civil Service subsistence allowance which hasbeen increased twice since January 1972.    However the Peers&apos; allowance was not referred to the TSRB on the last occasion (although it was consideredby the previous Lawrence Committee).    I think it preferable not to do sothis time.    I would propose instead to discuss with the Lord Privy Sealwhether and what changes would be appropriate for Peers so that we canconsider MPs1 and Peers&apos; allowances together when we have the TSRBrecommendations on MPs&apos; allowances.8. The proposals in this paper have been discussed with officials inthe Treasury and the Department of Employment.E privy Council Office14 May 19742
