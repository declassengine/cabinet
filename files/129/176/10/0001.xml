COPY NOCABINETIMEMBERS&apos; OUTSIDE FINANCIAL INTERESTSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council.        Since the General Election I have continued with the opposition and Liberal Chief Whips the confidential inter-party discussions begununder the previous Administration about the declaration and registrationpublicly of Members&apos; outside financial interests.    Agreement has nowbeen reached on the basis of the draft House of Commons resolutionsset out in the Annex.2. These draft resolutions provide for -a. a clarification (resolution (1)) of the present conventionwith regard to the oral declaration in debate etc. of a Member&apos;personal financial interests; and b. the establishment of a written register of Members&apos;outside financial interests (resolution (2)).3.        A major difficulty has been the problem of defining whatconstitutes a registrable &quot;financial (or pecuniary) interest&quot; in a way thatis clear and yet fair as between Members with different types of&quot;financial interests&quot;.    If registrable &quot;interests&quot; are confined to those that can be precisely defined, the range of interests covered will benarrow and will exclude other types of &quot;interests&quot; which could be equallyrelevant to a Member&apos;s activities in the House.    To meet this difficultyresolution (?.)(b) makes the register open-ended, ie any type of &quot;financial interest&quot; can be registered if the Member himself thinks it relevant,but resolution (2)(a) gives guidance on the general scope of the registerby specifying the range of interests which it is expected that a Membershould register.    I believe it must and should be left to the individual member to judge whether any particular financial interest of any kind ierelevant to a matter before the House and whether it should be registered.1C(74) 3530 April 1974
4. I would propose that the register should be kept by the Houseauthorities and should be available to the public.5.        Similar arrangements may need to be considered for the Lords.6. The resolutions provide for a voluntary register.    There will undoubtedly be strong pressure from some of our own supporters for a compulsory register.    This would, equally, be firmly resisted by mostof the Conservative Party and some members of other Parties.    Ibelieve that a formally compulsory register is open to some objectionbecause of the problems of definition and fairness referred to above.Enforcement and penalties would also raise problems.    And the effective-ness of a voluntary register should not be underrated, because therewould obviously be strong pressures on Members to register their interests and it will be in their own interests to do so.    My own view isthat a voluntary, open-ended and loosely defined register on the lines agreed would avoid these problems; would be fair as between members with varying types of financial interests;  and would not involveunacceptable intrusions into Members&apos; privacy.    It would also providefor Members as comprehensive a defence as possible against imputationsof concealed financial motivation.7. If a compulsory register were preferred, the most practicable wayof proceeding would, I believe, be to embody the terms of resolution (2)with the amendments shown in the Annex, in either a resolution of theHouse or in its Standing Orders and leave it to the House to determinefor itself in this matter, as it does in respect of privilege, whether aMember has offended and if so what consequences should follow.    On this basis, I do not believe it would be either practicable or necessary to reopen the search for a comprehensive and acceptable definition of&quot;financial interest&quot;; we should have to leave the judgment of &quot;interest&quot;and Relevance&quot; to the House itself.8.        It is desirable to bring this to a conclusion as quickly as possible.I think we must leave it to the House to decide, by a free vote, the natureof the scheme to be adopted.    The immediate question for decision,therefore, is whether, though willing to accept whatever conclusion the House may reach, we should initially propose the voluntary scheme onwhich agreement has been reached or - particularly if our own supportersstrongly desire this - a compulsory scheme.    If the Cabinet prefers the agreed voluntary scheme then the next step would be for the conservative opposition to put the proposed resolutions to their 1922 Committee and forus to put them to the Parliamentary Labour Party.    It is desirable that each should consider the proposals at the same time.    I would proposethat the draft resolutions should be put before the Parliamentary LabourParty and the 1922 Committee at meetings on Thursday 9 May.    If theagreement for a voluntary register is then accepted, I would table theresolutions immediately afterwards.    If the Cabinet prefers the compulsory scheme, we should need to consult the Parliamentary LabourParty and to inform the Opposition Parties of what was proposed.    Subjectto the outcome of the consultations, I should then table the amendedresolution.2
9. I invite my colleagues to consider the proposed resolutions for establishing a register of Members1 interests and to decide whetherParliament should be asked to settle the matter on the basis of the agreed resolutions with a voluntary register or on the basis of amendedresolutions and a compulsory register.E privy Council Office30 April 19743
