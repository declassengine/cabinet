OVERHAUL OF CHILEAN AERO-ENGINESMemorandum by the Attorney general. The Legal QuestionsIf the Government adopts the proposals made by the Secretary ofState for Industry in paragraph 7 of his memorandum C(74) 31, the mainlegal questions which will arise will be whether the Government will by so doing, iay itself open either -a. to an action for damages by Chile in our own courts for inducing a breach or (possibly) preventing the performance of the contract between RR (1971) and the Chilean Air Force;  orb. a claim by Chile that we are in breach of obligations owedto them in international law.2.        In order to advise on the first of these questions, it is necessaryto consider the contractual obligations between RR (1971) and the chilean Air Force and also the effect upon these obligations of theexercise of export licensing powers.3. The contractual position between RR(1971) and the Chilean AirForceI am informed that an agreement between RR (1971)jand the chilean Air Force, dated 3 September, 1969, governs the repair andoverhaul of aero-engines and the supply of spares and that this is theonly contractual document which has to be considered.   The legal effectof this agreement is not wholly clear, but as far as I am able to judge onthe information at present available to me, the position would appear tobe as followsOverhaula.      RR(1971) have a contractual obligation to overhaulsix engines at present with them.copy NO    g]C(74) 4415 May 1974CABINET
b. It seems probable that RR(1971) are also under a contractual obligation to overhaul such further engines as the chilean Air Force may send to them for that purpose from timeto time.c. I understand that RR(1971) take the view that they areentitled to determine their obligations in respect of the overhaulof engines by giving three months&quot; notice to the Chileans.   Ithink that that is almost certainly the correct view.    On thatassumption, I consider that if such notice were given byRR(1971) it would only relieve RR(1971) of the obligation tooverhaul any engines sent after the expiry of the three months1notice and that it would not affect their obligation to overhaulengines with them at the date of the giving of the notice orreceived by them during the three months1 notice period.i  -       Il &apos;     II-    ,Supply of Sparesd. It seems probable that RR(1971) are contractuallycommitted to provide spares and other supplies for the enginesfrom time to time ordered by the Chilean Air Force.    Iunderstand that RR(1971) accept that they have no express rightto determine this obligation and again this seems to me to be almost certainly right.    It is, however, possible that a term isto be implied into the contract enabling either party to givereasonable notice of termination.    However, if this is so, I doubt very much whether less than a year&apos;s notice would beconsidered reasonable in relation to a contract of this nature.e. Under the terms of the agreement RR(1971) is relieved of any liability for delay in the manufacture Or delivery ofsupplies due (inter alia) to Government action or labour disputes.The effect of the exercise of the power to license exports onthese contractual obligations of RR(1971) and their performanceThe position would appear to me to be as follows:-a. Export licences are required for the return of theoverhauled engines to Chile.    Such licences have been granted /in respect of six engines v/hich are with RR at present.b. These licences could be revoked and further licences issued in respect of these engines and any other enginesreceived from Chile which only permitted their return in anunoverhauled state.    This would not prevent RR(1971) fromoverhauling the engines, but since it would prevent the return of the overhauled engines to Chile, it might well have the effect2
of frustrating their obligation to do so.    There is, in my view,a bare possibility that the courts might regard Governmentalaction in the circumstances of this case which frustrates theobligations of RR(1971) as being unlawful and thus hold either that the Government is liable in damages or, possibly, that the revocation of the licences is null and void.c, The export of spares to Chile is at present authorised under an open general export licence of 22 December, 1971, whichpermits (inter alia) the export of specialised parts and components of aircraft engines to everywhere except 21specified countries. *d. This licence could be revoked and re-issued with Chilespecified as one of the countries to which these exports are not permitted.    If this were done, RR(1971) would be under noliability in damages to the Chileans for the ensuing delay indelivering the spares, since this would be due to government action and as explained above, RR(1971) are expressly relievedunder the contract from liability for delay in these circumstances.There is again, in my view, a bare possibility of the Governmentsaction in these circumstances being regarded by the courts asunlawful with the same consequence s as I have mentioned in b.above.5. The Question of obligations in International LawI) &apos;I am informed that the part played by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the initial arrangements to supply Hunter aircraft (whichwere powered by Rolls Royce Avon engines) was as follows.    At ameeting between the United Kingdom Minister for Defence equipment and the Chilean Ambassador on 19 June, 1969, the United kingdom minister appears to have assured the Chilean Ambassador that her majesty&apos;s Government would do everything possible to arrange for theRoyal Air Force to release the Hunters which the Chileans wished tohave refurbished and then to purchase.    On 30 July, 1969, a Ministryof Defence official wrote to the Chilean Ambassador; in his letter be referred to the arrangements for the release of aircraft from the RoyalAir Force, and concluded by mentioning that Hawker Siddeley proposedto make a new offer to the Chilean Air Force on these lines and that he hoped that it would be acceptable to the Chilean Government.6. A further letter was sent by a Ministry of Defence official to the chilean Air Attache dated 8 September, 1969.    This letter recalled thatthe Minister for Defence Equipment gave assurances to the ChileanAmbassador in July, 1969, to the effect that a phased release of RAFHunter aircraft had been agreed to meet their requirements.    It went onto say that the detailed programme of releases had been conveyed toHawker Siddeley Aviation, and that it was understood that the Company,3
on the basis of the undertaking that the Ministry of Defence had given them as regards the release of aircraft, would be able to meet the chilean delivery requirements subject to the immediate placing of a contract.7. Neither the record of the meeting between the United kingdom minister and the Chilean Ambassador, nor the subsequent letters fromofficials, makes any mention of overhaul or the supply of spares.    Butwe have feom time to time granted export licences in respect of thisafter-sales service.8. The documents referred to above reveal no evidence of anyexpress contractual undertaking by previous Governments relevant tooverhaul and the supply of spares.9. The fact that export licences have been granted for the export ofoverhauled engines and spares would not, in my opinion, in theabsence of an express agreement or of other special circumstances, besufficient in itself to sustain a contention that there was an impliedagreement that licences for the export of these articles were guaranteed.In the circumstances, therefore, it is very unlikely that the Chileanswould be able to establish that there was any kind of implied agreementbetween the United Kingdom and Chile whereby we undertook to permitoverhaul or the supply of spares for the aero engines concerned.10.       There remains the question whether, because of assurances andthe conduct of previous Governments, the United Kingdom is now estoppedunder international law from preventing the overhaul of the engines, andthe supply of spares.    The documents referred to above show that in 1969Her Majesty&apos;s Government not only approved the supply of the aircraft toChile, but was actively encouraging the sale.    Prima facie, the Chileanscould argue that in the case of sophisticated equipment such as Hunteraircraft this necessarily implied that we would allow the subsequentoverhaul of the engines and the supply of spare parts which, as both governments must have known, would be essential if the Chileans were to enjoy the normal use and life of the aircraft.11.       On the other hand, we gave no specific assurances in 1969 aboutthe future overhaul or supply of spares.    The Chileans would thereforeneed, if they sought to rely on the events of 1969, to be able to demonstrate that a necessary implication of our words and conduct was that we would permit service and spares to be supplied in the United Kingdom.    It maybe that the Chileans could argue that the only source of supply was in thiscountry;  the strength of such an argument would depend upon the factsconcerning the availability of service and spares outside the United Kingdomand the matter in the contemplation of the Government representativeswhen the exchanges took place.    These facts are not in my possession.Nothing however, in the documents so far submitted to me shows that therepresentatives of the United Kingdom and of Chile proceeded on the basis that the United Kingdom was the only source of supply.-      .4
12.       The significant event3 since 1969, in the context of estoppel,have been that the aircraft engines have been overhauled here from timeto time and that spares have been supplied.    The Chileans could argue that the grant of the licences reinforces assurances given in 1969 and the reasonableness of the assumption that we would continue to put no obstacle in their way.    Against this it can reasonably be maintained thatthe grant of licences, even over an extended period involves norepresentation as to the future, and that we are entitled to treat eachapplication on its merits.    Moreover, it can be aigued that since wegrant export licences to the British company concerned this involves no representation by us to the Government of Chile.    In addition, evenif the Company was acting as agent of the Chilean Government, it isclear on the face of each licence that it is issued subject to the condition that it may be modified or revoked at any time without reason given.13.       conclusions.       The contract with RR(I971)RR(1971) have commitments under their contract from which theycannot immediately escape without the agreement of the Chileans.If the Government attempted to persuade them to do so it would belaying itself open to the risk of an action for damages for inducinga breach of contract. There would be no objection, however, toinviting RR(1971) to exercise such rights as they may have tobring the contract to an end.ii.       The Government could, by exercising its export controlpowers, prevent RR(1971) from performing its contractual obligations in relation to the supply of spares and probably makeit very much less likely that they will continue with the overhaulof the engines.    There is a bare possibility that this might laythe Government open to proceedings in our own courts.iii. International claims by ChileIt is very unlikely that the Chilean Government could establishthat there is any kind of implied agreement between the UnitedKingdom and Chile whereby we undertook to permit overhaulsor the supply of spares.iv. We cannot rule out the possibility that the chilean government could sustain a case against us on the ground ofestoppel, arising from past statements and conduct of the UnitedKingdom Government on which they have relied to their detriment.But, on the facts so far known to me, they would have considerabledifficulty in trying to do so, and it seems unlikely that they would succeed.S C SLaw Officers1 Department15 May 1974 5
