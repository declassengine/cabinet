pGSCgSDE1*     The Arj^o-OTrench Agreement of 1962 relating toConcorde (&quot;the Treaty&quot;) imposes upon each of the two -nations an obligation to develop and produce a civilsupersonic transport aircrafto   That obligation can bemore specifically defined as an obligation (a) to share,equally the expenditure incurred by the two governments on development and production;    (b) from time to timejointly to authorise development and production inaccordance with the procedures established under theOJreaty for authorising successive phases of the project\   and (c) to make every; effort to ensure thatthe programme for the project,&quot; as jointly agreed fromtime to time, is carried out*2o - - The position-&apos;which has now been reached xuider thetreaty is that the production of 16 aircraft has been authorised, and is under way but not completed-   JTrance3aas now proposed the authorisation, of the production ofthree further aircraft and a small amount of further development work.to permit the aircraft to carry morefuel and thus to have a longer range o   In determining whether the UcKc is legally entitled unilaterally to cease to implement the project now, it is necessary toconsider the following two questions:
(1)   Is the Uolw under any obligation under the treaty to authorise the production of further aircraft?(2)   Is the TJ^EI. obliged to continue to ensure thebeen authorised, in particular by continuing tosupport it with Government finance?. Before giving our Opinion on these two questionsmake the following preliminary observations(a)   We are satisfied that we now have sufficientinformation, deluding that which derives from recent Anglo-Prench discussions at Ministerial.  - level, to express reasonably firm views on thequestions referred to above   But our advice mustnecessarily be based on such facts and otherassessments as are at present available to us*   -:.It may need to be reviewed if further material-considerations come to light in the course of any future negotiations with Prance or of discussions with, other interested parties.,   In particular,-Prance has not yet given any clear indication of how it regards the legal position^   Any views which Prance may express on this subject could bematerial, in assessing the strength of the UeKo&apos;legal position.,.production of the 16 aircraft which have already(b)   An event has recently occurred which may sensiblyaffect the weight which the Government shouldattach to legal considerations in reaching a
decision on this mattero   In January of this year,Prance withdrew its acceptance of the compulsoryjurisdiction of the International Court of justice and denoun.ced the General Act for the PacificSettlement of International Disputes of 1928*   Inthe absence of any provision in the Treaty for compulsory arbitration or adjudication, it wouldappear that Prance cannot now take the &apos;U*l a to theInternational Court or to arbitration without theU,K. es consents.   If, however, a legal dispute wereto arise and Prance proposed that it should besettled by international adjudication or arbitration,this proposal would require our careful consideration.;In considering this proposal we should need to bearin. mind that our traditional policy ha3 been to.encourage the use of adjudication or arbitration asa weans of settling international disputes, and alsothat, as e:rplained in paragraph 14 of this Opinion,there could be a particular reason for agreeing tosuch a proposal in the circumstances of this case*But, if we were to agree in principle to the disputebeing resolved in&apos;this way, no - adjudication orarbitration could in fact take place until both parties had agreed on the form of the tribunal andon. the questa.ons to be referred to ito   It appearsto us, therefore, to be now less likely than it waswhen, the Law Officers advised on this matter in the
past that legal questions arising under- the treaty will become the subject of international legal proceedings*   Even if there, are to be no legal proceedings, however, our legal, position would remain material;   but the significant question wouldthen be whether the U. o has a position which can reasonably be defended in negotiations with france and  in public debate..- &apos; . -Ue turn now to the two questions^ set out above -(1)   Is the under any obligation underthe Treaty..to, authorise; the production&apos; of further aircraft?1 .&apos;*.&apos;*..v. &quot;1 . . ..        : I;! .       \JI   - &apos;    .     :   &apos;.&apos;^ jCl^tx . i4-*        The Treaty provides in general terms for thedevelopment and production of a civil supersonic transport-aircrafto   Neither., the terms of the Treaty nor the more detailed contemporaneous arrangements between the partiesgive any indication, specific ox capable of estimation, ofthe number of aircraft which are to be produced,,   It can,however, be reasonably inferred from the terms of. theTreaty, from statements made at the time it was enteredinto, from the practice of the parties and from exchanges,between them during the course of the project (inclxxdingin particular the Benn-*Charaant exchange of correspondencein 1968), that the fundamental objective of the &apos;Treaty was
the development and production of a marketable aircraft.,By &quot;marketable&quot; we mean that there should be a reasonableexpectation -that the aircraft will be sold in. sufficient numbers and at a price and within a time-scale which willanable the manufacturers to make an overall profit on.production and, so far as may be practicable, will provide some benefit to the two Governments in respect of their investment in the development of the aircraft * , &quot; &apos;-.5*        &apos;fhe treaty does not set out in detail the steps tobe taken in the implementation of the project but leaves;bhese to be fixed by agreement between&apos; the two countries.on the basis of recommendations made by the Joint&apos; StandingCommittee of Officials (now the Concorde Directing ;Committee) which was set up under Article 5 of the Treaty oPlainly,.&quot;the intention was that the number of i aircraft tobe produced should be determined from time to time by. agreement&quot; between the two countries and should be so determined by reference to the fundamental purpose of the1&apos;treaty, namely the production of a marketable civilsupersonic transport aircraft   It follows, in our opinion,that the basic criterion to be applied in determining whether the UJ * is obliged to authorise further aircraft to be constructed is whether there is a.reasonable prospect that such aircraft would be marketable, ei*bheron their own- or as part of a staged programme of productiono
The Marketability of Concorde -6.        When the last authorisations of production of aircraft were given in April 1972, 74- options datingfrom 1964-63 were held by 16 airlines, and it wasconfidently expected that the competitive threat posedby BOAC and Air Prance placing orders would persuadeother airlines to follow suit-    here was therefore stillreason to believe that there would be a substantial numberof saleso   These expectations have not been realised.On the contrary, since the BOAC and Air Prance orders were announced in June 1972, no other airline has yetplaced an order, and during the course of last year allbut two of these option-holders gave up their options,and the others (Japan Airlines and Air India) agreed tothe negotiations being postponed.   Also, the preliminarypurchase agreement with China and the letter of intentsigned by Iranair have not been converted into orders and the former has in fact been allowed to lapse*   Iheposition would now therefore appear to be as follows:--(a) It is now accepted by both countries that thereis no reasonable expectation that aircraft&apos; within the 2b?eaty8s contemplation will be soldat anything but a-, loss on production.(b) In its recent report the Concorde DirectingCommittee reached (inter alia) the following conclusions:
&quot;It remains probable that no orders will be/received before Air Prance and British Airways,: put the aircraft into service *   In addition,7 however, Air Prance and British Airways service\alone cannot now be expected to generate the competitive pressure necessary to lead tofurther sales. 11&quot;No credible evidence has.been produced as to how any portion of the theoretical demandcould be translated into firm sales, within the foreseeable future.&quot;-In these circumstances, great uncertaintysurrounds the prospects for sales beyond those already made to. British Airways- and Air&apos;. Prancewhatever version is offered to airlines.&quot;Moreover, the manufacturers, who have always beenthe most optimistic of the parties concerned withthe aircraft, now concede that the market for theexisting version of the aircraft is very small.These assessments were not disputed by Prance atthe recent Ministerial meeting..There is no reason to suppose that the modifications which Prance has proposed would substantially:improve the commercial prospects of the aircrafto
7o        On present assessments, therefore, Concorde is nota marketable aircraft.   Moreover, it is necessary to haveregard to the expense of maintaining the programme and tothe fact that it is not practicable to suspend production for a substantial period and thereafter to resume it*   Inview of, all these factors there would not appear to besufficient chance that the position will be altered byfuture events, and in. particular by the putting of theBritish and iiirench airlines&apos; aircraft into service, tojustify deferring a final assessment of marketabilityuntil these events 3iave occurred..Conclusion. .8a      -:She project has now reached the stage at which inour opinion, it is appropriate to make a firm assessment of the commercial&apos; prospects of the aircraft,,   It is apparent on the evidence before us that neither thepresent version or Concorde nor the modified versionproposed by France is marketable,   Ue do not considertherefore that the U,Ko is obliged by the Treaty toauthorise, the production of any further aircraftw(2)   Is the UolL, obliged to ensure theproduction of thei 16 aircraft already authorised, in particular by continuing,to&apos;l suupprt^ it with Government finance?fco*  3 *rt&quot;9
9*        Eha production of the 16 aircraft was duly-authorised by the two countries in accordance with the procedures established under the treaty.   It follows that it is now part of the programme which under Article of the Ereaty the UeK^ is obliged to make every effort to ensure will be carried out.   In these circumstances,the U.K* will, in our view, be entitled to withdraw its support from the production of these aircraft only if itcan establish that it is entitled to do so under the doctrine of international law relating to fundamental change of circumstances.the  Doctrine of Fundamental Change of Circumstances10*      The doctrine of fundamental. change is an acceptedpart of customary international law0   Its principles3iave been embodied in Article 62 of the Vienna convention on the law&apos; of (Treaties which, nay in. many respects beconsidered as a codification of existing customary law onthis subject,, - The- relevant part of Article 62 is asfollows:-- &quot;A fundamental change of circumstsn.ees whichhas occurred, with regard to those existing at- the tine of the conclusion of a treaty, andwhich was not foreseen by the parties, may notbe invoked as a ground for terminating orwithdrawing from the treaty unless:
cSECRET&quot;(a)   the existence of those circumstancesconstituted an essential basis of the.    consent of the parties to be bound bythe treaty;   and&quot;(b)   the effect of the change is radicallyto transform the extent of obligations- .  still to be performed under the treaty.,&quot;Although the Vienna Convention has been signed bythe U.K. (but not by Prance), it is not yet in force andit applies only to treaties concluded after its entry into force.   (Therefore the U6K* case must rest on customaryinternational lav rather- than on the terms of theConvention c p :^damental . change,,and the 16 aircraft- &quot; . &quot; . -11 o       r.Die production of these aircraft was authorised in four batches between December 196? and April 1972*   2hroughou.-.this period substantial sales of the aircraft were beingpredicted and there still remained reasonable grounds for believing that the aircraft could prove to be marketable0The purpose of authorising the production of these aircraftappears to have been both to maintain the momentum of theprogramme and to build up a stock of aircraft under construction to meet orders which were expected but had notyet been received.   Even the most pessimistic forecast atthat time predicted sales substantially in. excess of 16o
It was clearly not envisaged that even before thecompletion of 16 it would become apparent that all reasonable prospect of marketability of Concorde haddisappeared.   Rather was it expected that in response to market demand and the requirements of the production programme further authorisations would be. given in due course.   The giving of authority for the production ofthese 16 aircraft was thus regarded not as a step whichcould be justified in isolation from the programme asa whole, but rather as a stage in the process of imple-menting the fundamental purpose of the Treaty to produce a marketable supersonic aircraft. -12o       In the light, however, of the recent eventsdescribed in paragraph 6 above, it has become apparent&quot;that the aircraft cannot reasonably be expected!) to bemarketable, that accordingly the fundamental purpose ofthe Treaty can no longer be achieved, and that in&quot;consequence there^is no obligation to authorise furtherproduction beyond the already authorised 16..   It is inthe light of this-conclusion that it is necessary to reconsider the justification for continuing to supportthe production of the authorised 16*   It is plain- thatthe fundamental underlying- basis on which the 16 were authorised has disappeared and that the context in whichthey would now be completed would be radically different from that in which they were authorised,.   The productionof 16 and no more could not conceivably make commercialsense.   But the production of more than 16, on the fact as&apos;we understand them, would make even less commercialsenses
Conclusion15-       It is never easy to predict with confidence howan international tribunal is likely to apply theprinciples of international law relating to fundamentalchangea   nonetheless, in the unusual circumstances ofthis case, it is our opinion that the U,.k1 could contendwith a reasonable prospect of success that a fundamental change has occurred entitling it to cease to implement the Treaty now and thus to discontinue its support forthe production of the 16 aircraft.   Certain preliminarysteps would however need to be taken before this rightof cessation could be exercised-   These are discussedbelowo . &quot;Vjhat.....steps ought to be taken before^ theUoIC could withdraw on S^^^^t^l^^^S^^change?14-o       In. order to comply with the requirements of&quot;international Taw,&quot;the TJ,K, would, before seelding towithdraw from implementation of the Treaty on grounds of fundamental, change, be required to give notice to france of its legal grounds, for withdrawal end to allow France areasonable time to make representations.    If Francedisputed our claim, the question of referring the matter to some form of adjudication or arbitration could arise*As we have explained above, France could not now obligethe. &quot;CUE, to go to the International Court *.  But it wouldbe in accordan.ce with the view the U,E, have hitherto
adopted as to the legal obligations of a State seeking to withdraw from a Treaty on grounds&apos; of fundamental   ...change that the TJ.KJ should offer in these circumstances to submit the issue of withdrawal to impartial adjudicationand should not withdraw without making such an offer.15&quot;   At what point in the course of negotiations with france and any ensuing, legal proceedings it would be appropriate for the TJcKe to permit the rundown of theexisting production programme and the form which suchrundown would take, would need to be carefully considered at that stage, if it arose, and if possible agreed-with .Pranceo   The risk involved in taking such action before-the matter is finally resolved would be that if thedispute were to go to adjudication or arbitration andthe U,K. lost, the fact that the -Uolw had withdrawn its support from the production -programme in such a way asto make it impossible or very difficult for Prance tocontinue with the project might aggravate any damageswhich in, that event were awarded against the TJaKtt *The impracticability of suspending production for asubstantial period and then-resuming, to which reference has been made in paragraph 7 above, is also relevant inthis contexto ,      &apos;When should the U*Ka *s legal position beput to Prance?- 13 -
16-       The ti77i3 rig and manner ..of the presentation of ourlegal position to Prance must&apos;obviously depend on the-decisions to,be reached by the Government and on the formof any further negotiations with Prance -   These matterscould have an important bearing on both liability and  -damages and, accordingly, we consider it to be essentialthat we should, together with the Secretary of Statefor Industry, work out the best strategy for negotiation-In the meantime, we must emphasise that if the government wish to - withdraw.unilaterally from the Treaty anyprolonged delay in giving notice to Prance of our grounds for doing so could prejudice pur legal case.   The samemay be -true, though to a lesser extent, of our case forarguing. that we are not obliged to authorise furtherproduction- .   &apos; : -S 6 C O S tP-KoA-25 April, 1974-
APPENDIXScLr\c JSHE QUESTION OF DAMAGESMemorandum by the Attorney-General1o...   The Committee asked me to advise on the amountof the damages for which the U.K* might be liable toFrance if we were held by a tribunal to be in breach of our obligations under the Treaty o20     In this memorandum I am assuming that no breach of our obligations would arise from the mere fact ofrefusal to authorise the production of additional aircraft in excess of the sixteen already authorizedo5o     The Committee will, however, recall the Law IIOfficers1 Opinion that the UoK* could contend with, areasonable prospect of success that it was entitledto cease to implement the Treaty now and thus, without incurring liability, to discontinue its support for
the production of the sixteen aircraft..   For thepurposes of this memorandum I am assuming that thisview is wrong and accordingly that a tribunal wereto hold that we ,ought to have continued to supportproduction of the sixteen aircraft until completionof them,4-o    At the present stage there are so many factorsrelevant to the question of damages which are unknownas to make any estimate speculative *   major points of uncertainty are, for example:-&apos;(a) What course the French would be likely totake in response to unilateral discontinuance of support by. the UoIU; etge whether they&quot;would discontinue the project or proceed;and, if the latter, how many aircraft theywould complete and hov; far they would seek toor could, rely on British facilities*(b) when the arbitration would take place and what the circumstances would then be asregards such Blatters as sales of the  &apos;aircraft produced and production costs.(c) what the actual financial consequences&apos;1 forthe French of the courses they might takewould be;   for instance, we do not know the contractual arrangements with the Frenchmanufacturers governing cancellation or
whether redundancy or similar sums wouldbe payable under French law0   Our present estimates of French cancellation charges are therefore arrived at simply by equatingthem with the charges which the U-K. wouldincur in cancelling the projects5o    Perhaps more important, the grounds upon whichthe XSoKe was found by the tribunal to be liable tocontinue with the project would be an essential starting point for a tribunal assessing damageSo   It is impossibleto predict this with any certaintyIt might be said .that no fundamental change of circumstances had occurredsuch as to justify our action;   or that there had-beena fundamental change, but not such as to justify our action;   or that we had failed to give due notice or tohave adequate consultation before the discontinuance-6*     In these circumstances it is not possible to do more at the present than to indicate -(a), the general principles as to the measure of damages which a tribunal would be likely toapply;(b) a number of broad bases, stemming from1thatprinciple, on which a tribunal might assessdamages, and
(c)   a range of possible figures for each basis*But it must be recognised that there is necessarily a substantial margin of errorin these figurese7*     Th% general principle as to the measure of damages under international law in respect of a breach of a treaty obligation is that the injured party mustbe piitj so far as reasonably possible, in the same position as if the treaty had not been broken,,   Theinjured par &quot;by, for its part, must take all reasonablesteps to mitigate its losseso8*     following these general principles there are,dexjendent. on the facts, at least four possible baseson which a tribunal -might assess damages in the circum-stancGs assumed:(1)   Nominal damages. ,(2)   If the French discontinued the project themselves the cost to them of the discontinuance (:ue6,cancellation charges, redundancy payments, etc)o(5)   If the French continued with the project,the net extra cost to them of producing thesixteen aircraftc(4-)    he cost to the French of the project so farplus cancellation costs,.
9o     As to basis (1), it is possible that the tribunalmight consider that there is no real prospect of makinga profit on the aircraft, so that the effect of ourdiscontinuance would not be to deprive the French of anything of value, but on the contrary would allow them to avoid incurring the substantial losses involvedin the pointless act of completing the sixteen, andthat therefore the damages should be nominal-&quot;  Thiswould in effect amount to a finding &quot;that the UoK-was only technically liable.,   This possibility is onthe whole remote, since in such circumstances it is unlikely that we should be found liable at all-10*   It also seem very improbable that a tribunal would assess damages on basis (4), since the maximumdamages required to put the French in the position inwhich they would have been if a breach had npt occurredwould be those assessed under basis (2)/  Basis (4)seems to me to be inconsistent with any . findihg otherthan one of fraud from the very outset of the Treaty,obligations6   03iere does not seem to me to be anylike.lib.ood of such a contention being advanced, still less sustained-11-   Accordingly, basis (2) end basis (3) are those to which serious consideration needs to be given andI!a broad estimate is made below for each of them-These estimates are at January 1974 prices;   theyare calculated on the assivoiption that -(a)   the costs to the Freiich of a given courseof action are approximately the same asthose to the U-E-, and
(b)   that the estimates of U.k1 costs inI     MC(74) 14- are correctsj120   Under basis (2), given that the tribunal awardedlittle more than the bare minimum of termination costs incurred by the French, the amount would be approximately 100 million^15*   Under basis O) if the French completed allsixteen aircraft, the net amount would be  150 million0&apos; Ms figure assumes that the TJ.k1 would be given credit for the selling price of all saleable aircraft completed and that the selling price is as now contemplated.14e   Tho following might bring the figure awarded abovethe smaller or above the larger of these two amounts:- &apos; il &quot;    o(a) General damages for loss of prestige mightbe awarded under basis (2)Q   In the circum-stances the amount awarded under this headwould probably not significantly exceed 10 million**(b) If the French continued with the project,under basis (3) some credit for the U.K.might be allowed for prestige, goodwillor other benefit accruing to the Frenchsolely, which under the Treaty would havebeen shared between the two governments.C
15*   If the French decided to continue with the project,the action of the U.k1 Government in helping or hinder-ing French execution of the project would be likely to affect the damages awarded.16.   As -between basis (2) and basis (3)j I think thaton the whole basis (3) is the more likely to be theaward.   This is because the French will not wish to weaken their case on liability by following our leadin discontinuing support for the aircraft.   If theywere to do so, they might find it harder to contend that there had been no fundamental change of circumstancesufficient to justify our discontinuing.   They wouldhave to show that discontinuance of support for thesixteen aircraft by oursolves made all the differencebetween saleability and non-saleability of the fiveaircraft, hot&apos;yet allocated.   In view of the history ofoptions, this&apos;would clearly be a difficult task,17*   The moot reliable estimate which I can give,therefore, lies between a minimum of nil damages anda maximum of about  150 million, with a possible inter-mediate figure of  100 million.   The procedures .available would permit of the assessment of damagesafter liability had been established.   Damages could also be a negotiated figure.   In the future discussionsit would be useful to seek out the likely intentions ofthe French in the event of the U.S. discontinuing.Lav; Officers1 Department17th May, 1974-.S.C.S.
