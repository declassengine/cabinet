BUILDING SOCIETIESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for the EnvironmentPRESENT position. As our colleagues will know, we offered in negotiation with therepresentatives of the Building Societies Association (BSA):- to arrange for short-term loan facilities for building societiesof up to  100 million at a rate of 10^ per cent.    The Bank ofEngland are providing these funds at the Minimum Lending rate and the Government will meet the difference between this and10^ per cent.- to arrange for further short-term loan facilities of up&apos;to 400 million at an average rate of  100 million a month.It was subsequently decided that these should be made available on similar terms from public funds.The BSA decided at its meeting on 19 April to accept the offer of loans of up to  100 million from the Bank and rot to recommend any increase in theordinary investment rate and the mortgage rate.    Subsequently the BSAdecided on 8 May to accept a further &quot;tranche11 of loans up to  100 million and again not to increase rates.    They intend to review the position inrelation to future loans month by month.2.        We hope that all or a substantial part of the loans will be repaidwithin the financial year, and in fact building societies may well not need to take up all of the loans if their receipts continue to improve as well asthey have done in the last month.3.        The threat of a mortgage rate increase because of the shortfall inreceipts has therefore now receded.    But there is still a risk that societieswill in the coming months increase their mortgage rates to keep theiraccounts in balance.    The recent increase in personal tax rates has1C(74) 45 COPY NO15 May 1974CABINET
increased the liability of building societies to pay tax on behalf ofinvestors.    This reduces a society&apos;s operating margin, which canadversely affect its reserves.    The BSA representatives thought that a growing number of societies would in consequence feel it necessary toincrease their mortgage rate by up to j per cent.    A handful of smallersocieties have already done so, and there is the possibility that largersocieties will take the same line.    If so, societies generally might followsuit.    We must watch this situation very carefully.HIGH POWERED committee .        The Cabinet also invited us to circulate proposals on theestablishment of a high-powered committee on longer-term questions ofprivate sector housing finance (CC(74) 8th Conclusions, Minute 4; and cc(74) 9th Conclusions, Minute 3).5,        The conclusions of the committee must command the respect if notthe support of the building society movement because in practice the bulkof funds for house purchase - at least in the short-run - must continue tobe channelled through building societies.    Provided that the building societies Association can be persuaded that this is a matter of participationrather than direction - and this should be possible - we would judge thatthe announcement of the committee should not prejudice our attempt toprevent a general increase in the mortgage rate.    It is of the highest importance to avoid affecting the confidence of investors and facing thebuilding societies with an outflow of funds.    We shall therefore have totake particular care over this when we announce the committee;  and anannouncement by a statement in the House of Commons may provide thebest opportunity for reassuring investors.6.        We suggest that the committee should be an independent one withthe following terms of reference:&quot;How best to ensure a stable and adequate flow of funds for private house purchase&quot;.The Committee should consider the proposal for a National housing finance Corporation and the proposed remit would cover this as well asthe basis on which mortgages are advanced (eg index-linked mortgages orequity mortgages),7.        We propose that the Chairman should, if he is available, beMr Charles Villiers, who is Chief Executive of the Guinness Peat group and was Chairman of the Industrial Reconstruction Corporation in1968-71.2
8.        It is important that the committee should comprise a wide and authoritative cross-section of experience and opinion.    We suggest thatit should include an economist;  a housing expert;  a building societyrepresentative; a local authority representative;  an insurance companyrepresentative;  someone with housebuilding experience;  and someone withrelevant experience in Whitehall.    The names we would agree with our colleagues directly concerned.9,        It is improbable that the committee could produce a comprehensive and authoritative report oh a subject with potentially far-reaching economicand social implications in less than six months.    We therefore proposethat the intention to establish a committee should be announced as soon asa Chairman has been found, with the intention that it should begin work by june or July.D KA treasury Chambers15 May 19743
