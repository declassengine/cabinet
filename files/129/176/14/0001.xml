SUPPLY OF WEST LAND WASP HELICOPTERTO SOUTH africa memorandum by the Attorney general. The question upon which I am in this Opinion advising is, put in itssimplest form: would the revocation of a licence for the export to SouthAfrica of a single Westland Wasp helicopter (&quot;Wasp&quot;) be consistent withour legal obligations, whether under domestic or international law?2. Accordingly this Opinion will not be concerned with -a. our general residual obligations under the Simonstownagreements (&quot;Simonstown&quot;);  orb. the political consequences of the action which it may bedecided to take;  orc. the wider question whether a policy of expanding whatbroadly falls under the head of &quot;internationalism&quot; can be consistent with an erosion of respect for the rule of internationallaw.3. The answer to the specific question upon which I am advising isthat in my opinion the revocation of the export licence, whilst probably a lawful exercise of domestic powers, would conflict with our internationallegal obligations.   Accordingly I cannot advise in favour of revocation.4.        Despite what I have said in paragraph 2 a. above, it is necessaryto look at the specific question against the general background ofSimonstown.    I hope in due course to be in a position to comply with therequest made to me at the meeting on 28 March 1974, to advise uponthe extent of our residual legal obligations under Simonstown to supplyarms and equipment and to carry out repairs to the order of theGovernment of South Africa.    For the reasons appearing below I am notyet in a position to do so.5. ,       The Simonstown obligations are recorded in an exchange of lettersin 1955.    The extent of those obligations has been the subject of persistentcontroversy.C(74) 39 COPY NO13 May 1974CABINET
6.        The Labour Governments of 1964-1970 took a narrow view of the simonstown obligations.   The Conservative Government of 1970-1974plainly wished to increase its exports to South Africa of arms and equip-ment.    It is worthy of note that no breach of international law would havebeen committed by the export of arms and equipment in excess of the legal obligations of Simonstown.    Apparently, however, the conservative government wished to be in a position to contend that any such exportsfell within the Simonstown obligations.    Accordingly, having invited theSouth African Government to place orders, it instructed its Law officers to advise on the extent of the remaining Simonstown obligations with the apparent object of supplying only such items as its Law Officers advised that there was a legal obligation to supply.7. The Conservative Law Officers gave their advice, and inFebruary, 1971, it was (contrary to usual practice) published as a white paper (Cmd. 4589).    The House of Commons debated the subject on March, 1971.8.        The Conservative Law Officers1 Opinion took a relatively narrowview of our legal obligations.    Nevertheless the Shadow Law Officers(Sir F. Elwyn Jones and myself) considered that it overstated our legal obligations.    The view of the Shadow Law Officers was expressed in the speech of the Shadow Attorney General during the debate: Hansard, ;vol. 812, columns 1775-1785.    Having reconsidered the conclusions reached in that speech, I adhere to the view which we then held that thoseconclusions correctly stated the legal position.9. The correctness of the conclusions reached in 1971 does not,however, answer the question put to me in 1974.    If it had done so, myadvice in this Opinion would necessarily have been that Simonstown does notoblige us to supply the remaining Wasp.    There are, however, twoprinciples of international law which may affect that conclusion.    Theseare -a. That the way in which the parties to an agreement infact perform their obligations under it may (particularly ifthere are differing possible views as to the meaning or extentof those obligations) be used to throw light upon the truemeaning of the obligations; and b. that in given circumstances the conduct of a party toan agreement may be relied upon to estop that party fromasserting that its obligations differ from those which would    .be consistent with that conduct.10.       The possible effect of these two principles upon the conclusions reached by the Shadow Law Officers in 1971 needs to be examined beforeadvi.ce can be given as to the legal position in 1974.    Accordingly, in orderto comply with the request of the Committee made at its meeting on28 March, 1974, it became necessary to obtain from the Foreign and2
Commonwealth Office full instructions as to all relevant events since february, 1971.    Those instructions were requested by my department on 29 March, 1974.    They have not yet been received.    Without  them cannot safely advise upon the full extent of the legal obligations which exist today and arise out of Simonstown.11.       Meanwhile, I have been asked to advise specifically about the Wasp.This is the seventh and last of a batch of Wasps ordered by the SouthAfrican Government from British manufacturers (Westland) in 1971.My advice is urgently requested.12.       Following the return of the Conservative Government in 1970 theSouth African Government, in response to a suggestion of theConservative administration, expressed its wish to purchase certainsupplies including Wasps.    Following the publication of Cmd. 4589, but before the debate of 3 March, 1971, the Foreign and commonwealth secretary informed the South African Government that &quot;the way was now clear&quot; for South Africa to place its order for Wasps.    The plain meaning of this statement (reinforced by the factors to which I have drawn attention in paragraph 5 above) was that the British Government wasinterpreting Simonstown and the extent of the obligations arising thereunderin accord with its Law Officers&apos; Opinion.13.       Until 10 May, 1974, my Department had no detailed information about the events which followed.    On that date a telex was receivedsummarising the contents of an agreement apparently made in October, 1971,between the South African Government and Westland,    This agreement provided for the supply to South Africa of 7 Wasps, together with equip-ment and spares at a price of some  1.9 million.   The obligation toprovide spares was to expire in October, 1981.14.       Export licences were granted by the British Government and later&apos;renewed.     Six of the 7 Wasps have been supplied and substantially paid for.    The remaining Wasp is due for delivery on 15 June, 1974, and for payment thereafter.    An export licence has been granted and is held bythe South African Embassy.    The agreement protects Westland fromliability for failure to deliver if caused (inter alia) by Act of State or government order or measure.15.      If the export licence for the Wasp is revoked and in consequence itis not supplied, it will be open to the Government of South Africa to contend that both Governments have construed Simonstown and the extent of theobligations arising under it as including the supply of the 7 Wasps; that both parties have acted upon that construction; and accordingly that the contract of October, 1971, particularly in view of the Law Officers&apos;Opinion, can be used to throw light upon the true meaning and effect ofSimonstown.3
16.      It will also be open to the Government of South Africa to contend that it was induced to enter into the contract by the undertakings of theConservative Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, particularly readin the light of the Conservative Law Officers1 Opinion, and that the doctrine of estoppel applies so as to preclude the British government from taking action to prevent the full performance of the contract ofOctober, 1971.17.       Finally, it will be open to the Government of South Africa to contend that, apart altogether from Simonstown, the agreement ofOctober, 1971, can stand alone as an enforceable contract, in respect ofwhich the British Government had so acted as to preclude itself from taking any action to frustrate the performance of the obligations under it.18.      In my opinion these contentions would be-well founded in internationallaw.    Accordingly it would be a breach of international law for the BritishGovernment to revoke the subsisting export licence with the object of preventing Westland from performing its contractual obligation to supply the single remaining helicopter.19.      It might further be contended that a revocation of the export licencewould be null and void in United Kingdom law, on the basis that statutes areto be construed, where possible, in such manner as to avoid a construction which enables a breach of international obligations to take place.    Thatcontention could be made in the United Kingdom courts.    In my opinion there is some chance that that contention would, in the circumstances ofthis case, succeed, but it probably would not.20.       Accordingly the principle danger involved in revocation of thelicence is that the United Kingdom would be held to have been guilty of a clear breach of international law.  There is some danger, though not so great, that the United Kingdom would be held in our own courts to havepurported to revoke the licence in circumstances in which such revocationwas not authorised by the statute and accordingly was null and void,21.      For these reasons I cannot advise that the licence be revoked or :*that any steps be taken to prevent the single remaining Wasp from beingdelivered to the South African Government.
