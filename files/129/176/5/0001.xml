REPEAL OF THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ACT:SAFEGUARDS FOR UNION MEMBERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. I seek my colleagues agreement to drop from the Bill the Clauseproviding machinery for appeals to a special tribunal by union membersagainst unreasonable expulsion or exclusion from a union, and to deferthis matter until the Second Bill.2. The consultative document on the Bill said that consideration wasbeing given to providing, either in that Bill, or in a later one, safeguards against arbitrary exclusion or expulsion from union membership.    Thoughthe issue was always more appropriate to the Second Bill, cabinet favoured, and I favoured, inclusion in the present Bill because of thedanger that if no provisions were made, the Opposition would succeed inwriting in their own (CC(74) 10th Conclusions).3.        It is now clear that the Trades Union Congress (TUC) feel verydeeply on this issue and with good reason and the way we have framed theprovision has done little to allay their fears.    If we were to persist it isclear that we would be left with a damaging breach with them.4. The TUC argue that such a provision is unnecessary.    Theyopposed it when Donovan made a similar recommendation.    They pointout that union members can, in any case, have recourse to the HighCourt if they believe there has been a breach of natural justice.Moreover, the TUC claim that since Donovan they have done a great deal to improve union disciplinary procedures.    They argue strongly that itwould be better to be saddled with an Opposition amendment which couldbe put right in the Second Bill, rather than have the Government commititself by putting forward its own provision.    They are certainly ready toconsider further with us what action might be needed if the matter can be deferred until the Second Bill.1C(74) 30 COPY NO24 April 1974CABINET
5.      There is much force in these arguments,,    We should be chary ofa provision which could mean awards of compensation against unions,where we could run into enforcement difficulties if the TUC arefundamentally opposed to the whole concept.6.        I therefore recommend that we drop the relevant Clause from theBill.    During the passage of the Bill, I would propose to draw on thearguments deployed by the TUC and to take the line that the right course is to consider with them what further action might be needed, including provision in the Second Bill, to supplement existing safeguards for union members.M department of Employment24 April 19742
