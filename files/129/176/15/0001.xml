COPY NO82Signed   JOHN hunt cabinet Office13 May 1974C(74) 4013 May 1974CABINETDELIVERY OF A WASP HELICOPTER TO SOUTH africa note by the Secretary of-the CabinetI circulate herewith a paper by officials, prepared on the Prime Minister^instructions, giving the factual background to the sale of helicopters to south Africa, with reference to the question whether the delivery of theremaining helicopter should be permitted.
SUPPLY OP WESTLAND WASP HELICOPTERS TO THESOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENTThe Issue1o     In 1971 &quot;the South African Government ordered 7 Westland Wasphelicopters.   Six have been delivered.   The seventh, which was due for delivery earlier this year, has been held up by production delaysand is now unlikely to be completed until 15 June.   An export licence,issued in January 1974f is at present with the South African Embassy.It is valid for one year, unless revoked.  ;The helicopter becomesSouth African property when the relevant documents are handed over tothe South Africans by the manufacturers on completion.   At presentthe helicopter remains the property of Westlands.   It seems most unlikely that the South Africans would take delivery of the helicopterbefore it was completed, although this would not of course be impossibleunless the contract specifically prohibited it.   The mechanics of the hand-over are that the relevant documents are passed by Westlands tothe South Africans and that the helicopter, packed at that stage incrates, then becomes the responsibility of the South Africans.Background including statements in Parliament and elsewhere(a)   Up to 19702*    Between 1962 and 1966 the South African Government converted2 former Royal Navy destroyers which had been purchased in 1950 and1952 to carry Westland Wasp helicopters.   Six Wasp helicopters were supplied for these vessels before 1964.3.    The South Africans purchased 3 anti-submarine frigates fromthe United Kingdom between 1962 and 1964,   At that time the frigateswere not capable of carrying Westland Wasp helicopters.   The frigateswere, however, subsequently converted with the co-operation of theAdmiralty to carry Wasp helicopters.   The first conversion was completed in 1969*4*    On 17 November 1964 the Prime Minister announced in the Houseof Commons that the Government had decided to impose an embargo onthe export of arms to South Africa.   Outstanding commitments by theMinistry of Defence would be fulfilled but no new contracts could beaccepted for the supply of military equipment.   Licences for the exportof sporting weapons and ammunition would be revoked and shipment stoppedforthwith.   (Hansard Col 199-200, 17 November 1964).   In subsequentexchanges the Prime Minister confirmed that the statement did not amountto the unilateral denunciation of the Simonstown Agreement, which wouldbe broken only by mutual agreement.5.    A Foreign Office letter of 9 March 1965 to the South african government (who had sought clarification of the Government&apos;s attitude to the supply, inter alia, of &quot;replacement of Westland Wasp helicopterwhich may be written off strength as a result of accidents or wear andtear or augmentation in numbers to meet South African naval requirements&quot;)stated that Her Majesty1s Government would be prepared to supply additionalWasp helicopters to meet South African naval requirements.   The letterexplained that in reaching their decision the Government had taken accountof the fact that these aircraft were integral parts of a complete anti-submarine weapons system supplied to South Africa under the simonstown agreement..1
6,    A contract for 4 helicopters was signed in November 1965 and theywere delivered during 1966.   In the course of a debate in the Houseof Commons on 3 March 1971, Mr Healey said of these 4 helicopters that &quot;thereis no doubt whatever that the 4 helicopters delivered by the Labour Governmentwere requested as part of the Simonstown Agreement to equip the frigatessupplied by Her Majesty&apos;s Government under that Agreement&quot; (Hansard Col 1771,3 March 1971).7.     In December 1967 &quot;the Government announced that their policy as statedon 17 November 1964 remained unchanged.   In December 1969 the South AfricanAmbassador was informed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that HerMajesty1s Government would refuse the supply of further helicopters.8.     In a subsequent communication Her Majesty&quot;s Government informed theSouth African Government that they were unable to agree to licence the supplyof further Wasp helicopters to South Africa and that any assurances containedin the letter of 9 March 1965 had been met by the supply thereafter of 4additional Wasp helicopters. /((b)   After 19709.     In a speech at the 1970 Annual Conference of the Labour Party, Mr Wilsonsaid, on 29 September, &quot;If the Conservatives, for whatever reason - be it anunwillingness to reverse the instant, ideological government ofSir Alec Douglas-Home, be it the pressures of the Monday Club, the Powellites -if they decide to spurn the Commonwealth, indeed to risk its very existence,by a decision to sell arms to South Africa, when whatever contracts they maysign will be repudiated by an incoming Labour Government at the next election.Any shipments arising from them will be embargoed.&quot;10.   The text of the Labour Party International Committee Resolution of 12January 1971, which was sent to each Head of Delegation attending theCommonwealth Prime Ministers&quot; Conference in Singapore, reads as follows:&quot;The Labour Party urges Mr Heath not to flout the views of the vast majority of the Commonwealth countries on the question of Britain&quot;sresumption of arms sales to South Africa.*The Party reaffirms its commitment to a multiracial commonwealth as a force fer world peace,&quot;The Party believes that the legal advice given to the last labour government was correct; there remains no legal obligation for britain to sell arms to South Africa under the Simonstown Agreement,&quot;Such arms sales would defy the authority of the United Nations,weaken the Commonwealth, and align Britain with the white racialistregimes of Southern Africa.&quot;The Labour Party reaffirms, therefore, that the next Labour IIGovernment will repudiate any arms agreement made with South Africa,&quot;11,   On 26 January 1971 Mr Heath said in the House of Commons of Her Majesty*legal obligations under the Simonstown Agreement that they extended to&quot;licensing the purchase of Westland Wasp helicopters to equip 3 anti-submarinefrigates that were purchased under the Agreement and were, with our agreement and assistance, converted to carry helicopters.&quot;   (Hansard Col 324 26 January1971).12, The Conservative Government accepted the opinion of the Law Officers ofthe Crown published as a White Paper in February 1971 (Cmnd 4589) t that theywere.under legal obligations arising from the Simonstown Agreement to permit the supply of the initial complement of Westland Wasp helicopters for the 32
British built frigates supplied earlier to the South African Navy and ofreplacements of the initial equipment and stores and base reserves of these vessels and of any other equipment necessary to keep them &quot;efficient for thepurposes of carrying out the objects of the Agreement.&quot;   Contracts for thesupply of 7 Westland Wasps were   signed later in 1971 and delivery of all but one, for which an export licence was issued by the previous Administration,was completed before the change of Government.   (The legal advice is summarisedlater in this paper),13.   On 22 February 1971 the then Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed the House of Commons that in response to an enquiry Her Majesty1 s Governmenthad informed the South African Government that if orders were placed for Wasphelicopters they would, according to their legal obligations, issue export licences at the appropriate time.   (Hansard Col 34 of 22 February 1971).   Inthe course of subsequent exchanges Mr Healey said &quot;,..the last Government,while maintaining that the Simonstown Agreement was useful, though not essential,also maintained on legal advice that there was no legal obligation to supplythese helicopters.&quot;   (Hansard Col 36 22 February). .Mr Healey later said(Hansard Col 37) that &quot;... the way in which this decision is received by theCommonwealth will depend very much on whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government seesthis ... as the first in a series of deliveries going far beyond our legal obligations, even as defined by the Attorney General or as strictly obligedby the Legal situation.&quot;14.   Subsequently Mr Wilson said (Hansard Col 41) &quot;Is the right hon. Gentlemanaware, one, that we do not accept the advice by the Law Officers in the white paper, contrary as it is to the advice we have on this question by no lesseminent legal advisers?&quot;   Later he said &quot;... there is no justification in law,morality or the interests of this country for supplying arms beyond what wasin the White Paper, even if we were to accept what was in the White Paper.&quot;15.  During a debate in the House of Commons on 3 March 1971, Mr Wilson said(Hansard Col 1719) &quot;The first (part of this motion) refers to the Government&apos;announcement of their intentions to supply Westland Wasp helicopters to theSouth African Government - helicopters which they claim on the basis of theopinion of their own Law Officers, they are legally required to supply underthe terms of the Simonstown Agreement,   We do not accept this argument.&quot;Mr Wilson went on to say &quot;I now turn to the decision announced by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary on 22 February to supply an unstated number of theWasp helicopters which were referred to in the Law Officers&apos; White Paper.   Ihave made it clear that we do not agree about the obligation which the LawOfficers have claimed to detect.   With regard to these allegedly outstandinghelicopters, we did not supply them, we would not have supplied them.   Irepeat - on the advice which we had and the policy which we followed, we wouldhave adhered to the decision which we took on coming   into office in October1964, which was in fulfilment of the decision of the Security Council of theUnited Nations.&quot;   (Hansard Col 1721 3 March 1971).   Later Mr Wilson said&quot;I oppose and deplore the shipment of those helicopters; I hope that I havemade that clear.   I oppose all arms shipments to South Africa.   I support,as I insisted on supporting by our action the day after we took office, theSecurity Council resolution of 1963.   I support it in the terms in which itwas moved, disregarding the unilateral interpretation which right hon. Membersopposite sought to place upon it at that time.&quot;    (Hansard Col 1731 3 March 1971).Legal Statements16,   The question arises whether there is an obligation under the simonstown agreement (ie, the agreement for the defence of the sea routes round SouthAfrica) to permit the export of this remaining helicopter.   There are opposingviews on the extent of the legal obligation to permit the export of helicopters.
The opinion of the Law Officers of the previous government, as set out in theWhite Paper published in 1971, contains the following conclusions which are relevant:-&quot;40*   Our conclusions on the question whether Her Majesty4sGovernment remains under any obligation to permit the supply ofthe initial equipment of the three anti-submarine frigates maybe summarised as follows:1. and 2.   ***********3* Her Majesty&apos;s Government have acknowledged and confirmed(by the letter of 9th March, 1965) that their obligation topermit the supply of the anti-submarine frigates and their equipment extended to the supply of the Wasp helicopters, asintegral parts of the complete1anti-submarine weapons system,4* The supply of the four additional Wasp helicopters in 1966did not discharge these obligations,5, Her Majesty&apos;s Government thus remains under a continuingobligation to permit the export from the United Kingdom of asufficient number of helicopters to equip the three anti-submarine frigates supplied under the Sea Routes Agreement withtheir initial complement of Wasp helicopters (together withreserves) if these are requested by the South african government,&quot;(Paragraph 39 of the Opinion stated that -&quot;If the establishment standards of the Royal Navy were applied,a total of eleven helicopters would be required to provide the initial equipment (together with the reserves) for thesefrigates,)&quot;&quot;51*   We conclude, therefore, that the Sea Routes Agreement shouldbe interpreted as implying an obligation on the part of Her Majesty&apos;s -Government, if so requested by the South African Government, to permit the supply of replacements of the initial equipment and stores andbase reserves for the vessels supplied from the United Kingdom, andof any other equipment, which is necessary to keep these vesselsefficient for the purpose of carrying out the objects of the Agreement.This would include replacement of such a number of helicopters as are necessary to arm and provide a reasonable establishment of reserves for the frigates,&quot;&quot;52.......Assuming that the South African Government makes a request in good faith for the supply of a Wasp helicopter to make good a deficiency in the complement of an anti-submarine frigate, there is an obligation on Her Majesty&apos;s Government to permit the export of thehelicopter if this is necessary to keep the vessel efficient forthe purpose of carrying out the objects of the Agreement.&quot;17*   Sir Elwyn Jones&apos; speech in the debate in Parliament in 1971 on the white paper contains the following passage which is taken to summarise his conclusions about the extent of the obligation to supply helicopters:-&quot;*..the United Kingdom&apos;s legal liability under this agreement,could be limited to permitting the provision of licences for acomplement of four Wasps for three frigates, for the replacementCONFIDENTIAL4
of Wasps lost in accidents or through, mechanical defect in thelight of the circumstances of each case as it is put, that isto say, where blame could reasonably be attributed to the manufacturer, and not otherwise, but not for replacementsrequired by normal wear and tear, and not for Royal Navyestablishment standards in so far as they exceeded either theSouth African claim or the complement of four tnat was supplied.&quot;My conclusion from this is that the liability restingupon the United Kingdom is stated, if I may say so with respect,far too widely in paragraph 39 of the Attorney-General&apos;s Opinion,in that it first overstates the initial complement r secondly,wrongly allocates to the two ex-Rcyal Navy destroyers the fourhelicopters which were plainly supplied in pursuance of the simonstown undertaking to equip frigates, and, finally, wronglyaccepts an open-ended obligation of replacement.   In my opinion,the legal obligations on the United1Kingdom arising under the simonstown Agreement are at the highest shadowy, and a strong case can be made out that they have long since been fulfilledby this country.&quot;(The South African claim referred to was the request for supply of helicoptersin 1967 which sought four helicopters in addition to six already supplied, ofwhich two had been written off).Parliamentary Interest18.   Since the election there have been 2 parliamentary questions about theWestland Wasp helicopters.   In a written answer on 11 April the parliamentary under Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Miss Lestor)said that no decision had been taken on the remaining helicopter and thatthe matter was being examined in the context of Her Majesty&apos;s general reviewof all aspects of policy towards South Africa and of other relevant factors.(Hansard Col 328 11 April 1974)*   On 2 May 1974* in another written answerMiss Lestor stated that 6 Westland Wasp helicopters had been delivered.   an export licenoe for the seventh had been granted before the change of Government.There was nothing to add to what she had said on 11 April regarding the delivery of the seventh helicopter.19.   An early day motion was put down on 9 May by Mr Neil Kinnock and 40 otherIPs in the following terms:&quot;That this House is gravely concerned at the information that consideration is still being given to the export of a WestlandWasp helicopter to the Republic of South Africa, recognises theimportance of such aircraft to the South African Government&apos;smethods of subordinating opposition to the system of apartheid;and calls upon Her Majesty&apos;s Government to revoke the export licence for the helicopter granted by the Conservative administration.&quot;5
