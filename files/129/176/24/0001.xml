ANNEXDEMOCRACY IN THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICEMEMBERSHIP OF HEALTH AUTHORITIESIntroduction1, i The G-overnment announced in the Queen&apos;s Speech its intention to review theworking of the reorganised National. Health Service.     The Secretary of State for social Services has made it clear that the G-overnment consider the system of manage-ment which started to operate in the reorganised Service on 1 April 1974 to beundemocratic and out of tune with the needs of local communities.2.    It would have been quite impracticable for the G-overnment which took office on 5 March to defer the date of operation of the reorganisation.    Arrangements werefar advanced, delay would have caused severe disruption which would have put at risk the health of individual patients and the public to whom our first responsibilitylies.    The Government is also acutely aware of the uncertainties and stresses whichstaff in the National Health Service are inevitably facing at the present time, andhas no wish to add to them.    The G-overnment is therefore not proposing any fundamentalstructural changes in the reorganised Service now, though it will keep its working under review and propose whatever changes seem desirable in the lightof experience.3.    In the short term, however, within existing legislation and without disturbingappointments already made, changes can and should be made to make the Service moreresponsive to the views of the people it serves.    The Government also believes that changes are needed to take greater account of the contribution which all those whowork in the Service can make to its management.    This Paper explains why theGovernment is not satisfied with the present arrangements in England, and sets out its proposals for changes.    The position in Scotland and Wales will be dealt with separately.The democratio process and the National Health Servicek.    The Labour Government published Green Papers, one in 1968 (also covering Wales)and another in 1970, aimed at stimulating discussion on the reorganisation of theNational Health Service in England.    The Conservative Government&apos; published a consultative Document in 1971 and a White Paper in 1972;   separate papers were published for Wales.    These led to the National Health Service Reorganisation Act 1973which covered both England and Wales,    Many features of thi3 Act were controversial&apos;and strongly criticised during its passage through Parliament;   criticism concentrated
on the bureaucratic, appointive and undemocratic nature of the reorganisation.    The local Government Act 1972 for England and Wales, which has had a major influence onthe structure of the reorganised health service, was also controversial and did not follow the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Local Government accepted bythe previous Labour Government.    There has been already, therefore, very extensiveconsultation on many of the central issues.    It is against this background of public!and Parliamentary debate that the proposals in this Paper should be assessed.5.    The National Health Service Reorganisation Act 1973 deliberately separatesresponsibility for managing the health service from responsibility for representing !the views of the public as the consumer.     This representative function is given to new Community Health Councils (CHCs), one for each health district.    Members of CHCslare at present debarred by the Act from serving as members of Area Health Authorities!(AHAs) or Regional Health Authorities (RHAs) and have no executive powers.    the health districts in some cases cover very large areas.     The boundaries have beendefined administratively by central government within the context of health care.The boundaries of the local government district authorities, which are responsible foghousing and environmental health, have in turn been drawn up in the light of local   government considerations.    The health districts and local government districts in Iconsequence bear in many cases no relation to each other, which presents someadministrative problems and makes any direct democratic representation on community health Councils difficult to achieve.    The Government do not accept that it ispossible or desirable to make such a clear-out distinction between management of publflIservices and representation of consumer interests and views.     Our whole nationaldemocratic process a3 it has evolved over the years is a complex interweave of manage!Iment and representation. While there are at times considerable advantages in the oildefinition of responsibility and even the separation of functions, to embark on total!separation is to challenge in a fundamental way the essence of democratic control,6.    The Government&apos;s objective is to develop a structure for the National health i IService which will allow real devolution to those operating the service locally with-1out detailed intervention from Whitehall or from the region. This is only acceptable]if there is a strong democratic element in the local administration to reinforce the national democratic control already provided by the Secretary of State&apos;s responsibililto Parliament. The same principles apply to the region. In marrying national withjlocal democracy, and national responsibilities with local devolution, we need toconsider several inter-related matters - the role of CHCs; the constitution of AHAa Iand RHAs and the role of their members; and the mechanisms through which theSecretary of State&apos;s national responsibilities can best be discharged without2
unnecessary involvement in local and regional affairs or in matters which are primarilythe concern of the health professions themselves.7.    This paper contains proposals on all the subjects mentioned in paragraph 6 except those relating to the Secretary of StateVs national responsibilities.    The settingof standards and redressing inequalities of care and provision in the health and social services are fundamental responsibilities of central Grovernment.    The Secretary ofState needs to be kept informed about the state of the services and the quality of care and to ensure that appropriate action is taken to remedy deficiencies.    There are many different means for doing this.    A major method is the selective allocation of scarcenational resources.    Methods also need to be further developed for providing thoseworking in the field with any necessary advice for improving the services in thepublic interest.     This is relevant not only to the NHS, but also to related services including those which are provided by local authorities.    Proposals on these subjectswill be announced separately as soon as possible for consultation with the interests concerned.Role of Community Health Councils8.    The structure and role of the Community Health Councils is of vital importance.The previous Government extensively revised their original proposals for CHCs, so asto make them more representative of community interests.     The relevant Londonborough, county and district councils, together with the local voluntary organisations(selected by the Regional Health Authority after consultation with the appropriatelocal authorities), now directly appoint five-sixths of the membership of each Council.The Councils are also more independent of the Area Health Authority than originally proposed;   and there is provision in the Act for the establishment of a national body to advise and assist the Councils.    The CHCs have been given powers to obtain information about the health services in their district and to enter and inspecthospitals and other health premises, and they must be consulted before decisions are taken on any substantial development or variation in services.    The District Manage-ment Team (DMT) - a small group of senior health service officers and practisingdoctors which is responsible to the Area Health Authority (AHA) for the management of most health services in the district - is expected to establish close working relationships with the CHC but there is no formal link.    Each CHC has a direct relationship with the chairman and members of the AHA who are required to meet the CHC at leastonce a year.     The CHC will make an annual report on its activities to the regional health Authority (RHA) which the CHC itself will publish, and on which the AHA mustpublish its comments including an account of steps taken on advice or proposals put to it by the Council.    In addition, the meetings of CHCs, AHAs and RHAs will be open3
9.    These are innovations intended to provide a new means of representing publicopinion on the health services to the authorities responsible for managing them, andmore public reporting by the press.    The task now is to develop the CHCs into a powerful forum where consumer views can influence the NHS and where local participatikin the running of the NHS can become a reality.    It will be important to establish a constructive dialogue between the CHC and the DMT of its district.     It is particular]important that CHCs should be consulted about developments in the services in their district at a formative stage when their views can influence decisions.    Both CHCsand DMTs are new concepts and need time to establish their own working methods and mutual relations, which should evolve in the light of experience.    The government does not wish to impose a rigid pattern nor to rule out local experimentation andvariation;   it will however take a particular interest in the ways in which CHCs areconsulted on developments, and will consider in the light of experience whether more detailed guidance on this is needed.10. The Government has already reached oertain decisions which will strengthen the role of CHCs. These, together with proposals for a National Council to advise and assist CHCs, are set out in paragraphs 23-24.Constitution of AHAs11.   The 1973 Act provides for consultation and collaboration between AHAs and localauthorities.     They provide services which are closely related but separatelyadministered.    Given this separation of functions, the new arrangements for joint planning and consultation through statutory Joint Consultative Committees (jCCs),supported by groups of officers, are certainly needed.    But there are fewer electedlocal authority members serving as members of AHAs than were envisaged in 1970, andthe Government consider this to be a serious weakness in the present arrangements.In particular, outside the metropolitan districts and the London boroughs, there areno arrangements for ensuring the appointment to AHAs of members of the districtauthorities responsible for housing and environmental health.    At present most AHAshave 4 members directly appointed by the county, metropolitan district or Londonborough councils;   a few have from 5 to 8.    The Government wishes a third of themembers of each AHA to be members of local authorities, the proportion proposed inthe 1970 Green Paper.    Proposals for increasing the number of local authoritymembers and for providing a direct link with the membership of the CHCs are inparagraph 18.4
12.   The Government also believes that it is essential that the National Health Servishould take more account of the contribution which all those who work in the service can make to its management.     In addition to the development of procedures for effective staff consultation, it would like to see members of AHAs drawn from amongstall who work in the health service in addition to doctors and nurses who already serveProposals to this end are made in paragraph 22.13.   The proposals in paragraphs 18-22 would mean an increase in the size of AHAs,At present most have about 15-19 members, eight have more than 21 and the largest has28,     Implementation of the new proposals would mean that 59 of the 90 AHAs in Englandwould have 25 members or less.    Their strict application would produce a number ofAHAs with more than thirty members.     The Government is conscious of the undesirabilit;of authorities becoming too large,    Por these authorities, a balance must be struckbetween the desirability of increasing the elected membership and avoiding the creatio:of unwieldy authorities;   the Government will give special consideration to this inmaking decisions on their total membership.    There will be opportunity to look again at the total and balance of membership within AHAs when the tenure of those alreadyappointed ends in three years time.Regional Health Authorities14,   The Government is considering urgently the report of the Royal Commission on theConstitution in relation to Scotland and Wales, and will be making proposals.     these may affect the health service.    The Royal Commission^ report will also be studied inrelation to England.    &apos;....*&apos; In view of this theGovernment is making no proposals at present for changes in the functions of theEnglish RHAs.    The number of members drawn from local authorities at present variesconsiderably from one RHA to another.     The Government wishes to secure that each RHAhas about one third of its members drawn from local government.     Proposals for theaddition of more local authority members and of staff are made in paragraphs 20 and 22Role of the Members of Health Authorities15,   The Government does not believe that it would be in the interests of the health service if members drawn from other organisations or groups were to act a3 a lobbyeither within the health authority or within the body by whioh they were nominated.All members of health authorities should participate fully and objectively in thecounsels of the authority and must share equally in responsibility for all its decisions and its use of resources provided by the Secretary of State with the5
authority of Parliament.     It will not be their responsibility to represent localauthority, staff or Community Health Council interests.16. ,Members from local authorities will bring with them their knowledge of relatedlocal government services, and provide a link with the people whom they have beenelected to represent on the local authority.     Cross-membership will enrich the contribution members can make to both the bodies on which they serve, and their firsthand knowledge of each will enable them to promote an informed understanding betweenauthorities.    This will be particularly valuable and will reinforce - but in no way replace - the vital network of working relationships and statutory consultation between health and local authorities in which the Joint Consultative Committees havethe central role.17.   NHS staff members will contribute their individual knowledge and working experience,They will be aware of the views of their fellow workers, and will help to ensure thatauthorities are fully responsive to the importance of staff relations in all aspectsof their work.     They will provide a valuable complement to the statutory professionaladvisory committees and also to the separate arrangements for staff consultation, thedevelopment of which the Government regards as highly important.Proposals(i)   Membership of Health Authorities18.   As a general rule, each CHC should elect two of its own members, at least oneof whom would be a district councillor, to be appointed by the RHA to serve for 2years as a member of the AHA responsible for the CHCs district;   CHCs in single-district areas should elect four of their members including at least two districtcouncillors, providing a minimum of four CHC members for each AHA.     To ensure thatone third of the total membership of the AHA is drawn from local government one ortwo additional appointments should where necessary be made by the local authority or authorities matching the AHA.    As mentioned in paragraph 13 these arrangements will need to be modified in areas where the result would otherwise be large AHAs.19.   The 1973 Act precludes members of CHCs serving on AHAs so that unless the Actwere amended members elected from the CHC would have to resign from the CHC while serving on the AHA;   it would be desirable that they should, nnherever possible, thenbe reappointed to the CHC.    There are arguments for and against a member of a CHCserving simultaneously on the AHA;   the Government would welcome views on this in thelight of which it will consider whether legislation should be introduced to allowconcurrent membership.6
20.   Additional appointments should be made by the Secretary of State to regional health Authorities to ensure that one third of the members of each RHA are councillorsdrawn from local authorities matching the AHAs.     In the first instance it willprobably be necessary to invite nominations from all such authorities which do nothave a member already on the RHA and for the Secretary of State to select those tobe appointed, but the Government proposes that in future the local authorities concerned should arrange among themselves to nominate whatever number of councillors the Secretaryof State determines for appointment by her to each RHA.21.   AHAs already have a minimum of two doctors and one nurse amongst their members,appointed by the RHAs after consultation with the professional organisations.    such appointments will continue but the Government believes that it would be preferable for the professions themselves to elect or nominate the persons to be appointedinstead of putting forward a larger number of names from which the RHA selects.Similar arrangements for appointment of medical and nursing members of RHAs would inthe Government&apos;s view also be desirable.    The Government will welcome the views ofthe professions on this and on methods of election or nomination, which might perhaps be linked to the procedures evolved by these professions for elections to Medical and nursing Advisory Committees under Section 8 of the 1973 Act.22,   Two members drawn from staff employed in the NHS, other than doctors and nurses,should be appointed by the RHA to each AHA and by the Secretary of State to each RHA.The Government will consult staff interests through the Staff Side of the NHS GeneralWhitley Council on methods of choosing these members.     The Government believe it isfor the staff interests to decide whether or not to have direct elections, and if they so wished the Government would arrange for AHAs and RHAs to conduct them.     A maximum of two such members is fixed with regard to the existing number of medical and nursemembers and the need not to make the authorities too large as explained in paragraph 1 3.(ii)   Community Health Councils23.   The decisions referred to in paragraph 10 which the Government has already takento strengthen the role of Community Health Councils are:-(a) Because of the very important part their Secretaries will have in influencinghow successful the CHCs will be, the posts should be filled by open compet-ition so as to give the greatest possible scope for attracting suitablecandidates;(b) One or more spokesmen of the DMT should attend CHC meetings when invited,where they would answer questions in public session;7
(c) In addition to the arrangements described in paragraph 18, CHCs should beamong the bodies consulted by BHAs before making appointments to AHAs;   theGovernment hopes that RHAs will attach weight to prior service on a CHC;(d) In future appointing bodies should not feel inhibited, from inviting NHSemployees or family practitioners to serve as members of CHCs unless theyare also members of Regional or Area Teams of Officers or District Manage-ment Teams;   it will be for each individual to decide whether to accept an invitation;(e) CHCs should have a special responsibility in relation- to hospital closures.The Government is currently reviewing the procedures for consultation on proposed closures.     But the establishment of CHCs enables it to make onechange in the present arrangements without further delay.    Guidance alreadyissued to health authorities makes it clear that CHCs should be consulted about all hospital closures.    At present all closures are subject to specific authorisation by the Secretary of State.    In future where the CHCaccepts the proposed closure this authorisation will not be required.    Ifa CHC wishes to object to closure then it will be expected to make a detaileiand constructive counter-proposal, with full regard for the factors,including restraints on resources, which have led the health authority to propose the closure.These are firm decisions, about which health authorities have already been informed,and are not proposals for consultation.24.   In addition the Government considers that there should be a National Council,with a budget drawn from central Government funds, to advise and assist CHCs.    Itbelieves that such a body could make a vital contribution towards enabling the CHCseffectively to fulfil their role as the local representatives of the users of health services.    It would provide a national voice for CHCs;   it could, for example,arrange conferences for members and staff of CHCs, promote and if necessary financeresearch into methods of ascertaining the views of users of the health services, andundertake or arrange surveys of user opinion on behalf of CHCs.     To be effective itwould need its own Director and this would be a key appointment.    The Governmenthopes and believes that CHCs will welcome the establishment of a representativeNational Council and it intends to enter into discussion with them as soon as is practicable about arrangements to this end.8
Action25.   In the light of comments received on the proposals in paragraphs 18-24 theGovernment will take action as soon as possible, including laving before parliament the orders necessary to increase health authority membership.    Written comments onthese proposals should be addressed to Division HS1C, Department of Health and social security, RoomA5o7, Alexander Fleming House, London, SE1 6BY.     Comments are requested not later than 31 July 1974.9
