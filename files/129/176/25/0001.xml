C(74) 50 COPY NO       8122 May 1974CABINETSPECIAL ADVISERS TO MINISTERS: POLITICAL ACTIVITIESMemorandum by the Lord Presideht of the council, At our meeting on 16 May (CC(74) 16th Conclusions) we discussed the rules governing the political activities of Special Advisers to ministers.    I was invited to circulate a memorandum examining the matter further.    Our general objective was to remove the inhibitionson Special Advisers taking part in political activities solely because theyare paid from public funds while maintaining sufficient defences against a conflict of interest.PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATURE2.        The Servants of the Crown (Parliamentary Candidature) Order I960(copy attached) at present provides that anyone who is &quot;employed in theCivil Service of the Crown, whether in an established capacity or not, andwhether for the whole or part of his time&quot; (other than certain specificallyexcepted categories such as industrial grades) shall not &quot;issue an address to electors or in any other manner publicly announce himself or allowhimself to be publicly announced as a candidate or prospective candidate for election to Parliament for any constituency&quot;.    In practice, therefore,civil servants, including Special Advisers paid from public funds, havebeen required to resign on being adopted as Parliamentary candidates.3. The existence of this Order puts the question of parliamentary candidature in a special category compared with other aspects of political activity.    If Special Advisers who are prospective Parliamentarycandidates are to continue to be paid from public funds, the only solution would be to amend the Order so as to extend to cover Special Advisers theexclusions set out in paragraph 1(2) of the Order.    For this purpose, itwould be necessary to amend or replace the Order; but since it is anOrder in Council made under Royal Prerogative, it is not subject to parliamentary control in the manner of some subordinate legislation,except of course to the extent that Ministers are responsible toParliament for the advice given to Her Majesty.    It would no doubt be appropriate to draw the attention of Parliament to what we proposed   ,jto do.
4. It would also be desirable to explain the situation to the Staff Side,who have never fully endorsed the need for formal restrictions on political activities of civil servants, and might not react favourably to lessrestrictive treatment for Special Advisers in this respect.5. If the rules on candidature are revised, it will still be necessaryfor anyone employed, whether in an established capacity or not and whether for the whole or part of his time, in the Civil Service to resign byNomination Day if he wishes to stand for Parliament.    This is necessary because the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1957 disqualifies civilservants (whether temporary or permanent) from membership of the Houseof Commons and renders void the election of the person who stood whilebeing disqualified.MEMBERSHIP OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES6. The extent to which civil servants may take part in localgovernment is a matter for Departmental discretion.    The mainconsideration is the risk of conflict of interest between the officer&apos;sofficial duties and his local government activities.    In the case of SpecialAdvisers, there is a risk of conflict not only with the duties he carries out for his own Minister, but with aspects of Government policy affecting localauthorities which are the responsibilities of other Ministers.    Moreover,there might be public comment if a decision of the Minister for whom theSpecial Adviser worked appeared to be favourable to the council of whichhe was a member,7.        It would be possible within the discretion allowed to departments to permit Special Advisers to serve on local authorities.    But the decision should be taken in each case by the Minister concerned and he would have toaccept responsibility for ensuring that no questions of conflict arose either with the policies for which he was responsible or those of his colleagues.A Special Adviser allowed to serve on local authorities would have to agreeto observe the following ground rules:-a. He should not speak publicly or in the council on matters forwhich his own Minister had responsibility.b. He should not serve on any committee considering suchmatters,c. He should not take part in deputations or otherrepresentations to the Minister.d. He should declare an interest in relation to anycase or application which comes before the council andin which his Department is involved.e. He should observe great discretion in relation topolicies for which other Ministers are responsible, in orderto avoid causing them embarrassment.f. He should not prematurely disclose to the councilinformation which he obtained in the course of his duties.2
POSITION OF PEERS8.        The Civil Service rule is that Peers in the politically restrictedgroup who wish to take part in a debate in the House of Lords should seekprior permission from their Establishment Officer.    They are barred fromspeaking in any debate that could be considered controversial in a party political sense.    There, is thus no reason why a Peer should not act as aSpecial Adviser provided he does not speak or vote in the House of lords on matters of Party political controversy without permission of his minister.conclusion.        My further study of this matter reveals no insuperable obstacle to the relaxation of the rules governing the political activities of SpecialAdvisers which we had in mind though I think it more likely than not that,notwithstanding any ground rules, difficulties will arise in individual cases.As we tentatively concluded, it would be desirable to discuss the matter with the Opposition before the changes are announced.Privy Council Office22 May 19743
