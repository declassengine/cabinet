NATIONALISED INDUSTRY prices memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The Prime Minister has asked for a review of the proposed phasing of price increases by the nationalised industries.    This paper summarises the present position and the annex shows for each industry the date fromwhich charges will take effect, the dates when consumers will first make payments at the new rates, and the effects on the Retail Price Index.2. Coal - An increase in the price of industrial coal from 1 April was announced before the Budget.    In my Budget Statement I said there wouldbe no summer discount for domestic coal; that the price of domestic coal would rise by 20 per cent on 1 November;  and that there would be a further increase on industrial coal in the autumn to yield  100 million.    It was expected at the time that this would reduce support to the coal industryto about  50 million in 1974-75; the latest indications are that this willbe more like  120 million unless prices are increased still further.3,        Electricity - In England and Wales, the announced increases will begin to affect domestic consumers on bills rendered after 1 August, whichwill increase by about 29 per cent, rising to 32 per cent on bills renderedafter 1 November.    These will leave an estimated deficit of  165 million.No decision has yet been taken about the effect of any autumn coal price increase on electricity prices.    In Scotland, as announced, single stageincreases of 26 per cent (North) and 29 per cent (South) are to beintroduced from 1 July, leaving a deficit of  20 million.4.        Gas - My Budget speech said that we have asked the BritishGas Corporation not to put forward any price increase (by implication,for the rest of this year; domestic gas prices rose by l\ per cent on1 January 1974).    It was then expected that the industry would break even this year, but the deficit is now forecast at up to  90 million (of whichhowever a net  80 million is attributable to changes in depreciationpractices, not all of which may be admissible).1C(74) 28 COPY NO 789 April 1974CABINET
5. Steel - Increases of 25 per cent generally, and 15 per cent ontinplate, were implemented on 28 March,    My Budget speech said thatthe Corporation intend to keep the new prices stable for the rest of 1974,6. Post Office - My Budget speech referred to increases in the summer.It is now proposed, subject to Price Commission approval, to increasepostal charges from 10 June, by increases of -fp and lp on the stamps for second and first class mail respectively, to bring in extra revenue in1974-75 of  65 million.    On the tele communications side, proposed increases averaging 19 per cent - on call charges from 3 June, and onquarterly rentals from 1 July, 1 August and 1 September - would raisean extra  144 million in 1974-75.    Taken together these increases are estimated to reduce the Post Office deficit in 1974-75 to  60 million.Postponement of the increases would add to this by  23 million a month.7. Railways - Subject to Price Commission approval, the increases proposed by British Rail would raise passenger fares by 12-1 per cent and freight charges by 15 per cent in mid-June.    My Budget speech referredto the summer and it is general public knowledge that increases of thissiee are expected in June,    The yield in 1974-75 is estimated to be about 65 million; but the deficit would still be some  215 million.    To post-pone the increases to later in the summer would add to the deficit onpassenger and freight services by   7- 8 million a month.conclusions. I draw my colleagues attention to the following main points:i. Apart from postal and telecommunications charges, allthe increases due to take place before the autumn have eitherbeen implemented or have a date on them which is publicly known.ii. It already appears that we will have to pay subsidies of 600 million or more compared with the forecast of  500 million in my Budget Statement.iii. Any rephasing would increase the bill still further.iv. The effects of the electricity and telecommunicationsincreases will be spread by the processes of billing,D treasury Chambers9 April 1974

As announced in the Budget debate the total RPI effect (direct and indirect) will on present plans be about 2% by the end of the year of which the direct^ffects will be about 1\% - see overleaf for cumulative effects.2.    RPI effects are scored as the consumer becomes liable but the processes of metering and billing mean that the bills are not actually paid until later - the exact time depending on when the particularsonsumer normally receives his quarterly bill.
