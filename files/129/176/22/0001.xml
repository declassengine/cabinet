LEGISLATING FOR THE  10 CHRISTMAS BONUSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for.Social services. At their meeting on 17 May the Social Services Committee were unable to reach a decision on the question whether the Bill needed to adjust the rates of national insurance contribution from April 1975 should include provision for repeating before Christmas the  10 bonus payment made to pensioners in 1972 and 1973.    For contribution purposes, this Bill needs to be introduced shortly after the Spring Recess; but the Chancellor of theExchequer wishes to leave open for some months yet whether there shouldbe a Christmas bonus this year, in relation to Budget strategy.    Moreover,the point was made at the Social Services Committee meeting that therewould be more kudos in announcing a bonus later in the year than therewould be if such an announcement were made at an early date.    It was left open to me to bring the matter before the Cabinet.2.        I am sure that in political terms we have no choice but to providea Christmas bonus - taking into account the expectation built up by whatwas said by our supporters on the authority of Transport House in theElection campaign.    Indeed, the Cabinet last month included this provision in the top priority list for legislation (CC(74) 8th Conclusions, Minute 5).Nor, in view of the criticisms we made in Opposition, can we confine thisyear&apos;s payment to people over pension age - we must include, irrespective of age, people drawing invalidity pension, attendance allowance, nunemployability supplement or widow&apos;s benefit.    This was agreed by the Social Services Committee.3.        I think that, apart from these political considerations, thereare three other factors which tell strongly against delaying the legislation:-i. It is clear that, especially in the present mood of the staff ofmy Department and to a lesser extent that of the Post Office, we shallhave a difficult task in getting them to agree to undertake a furtherbonus payment this year even to the categories covered in 1972 and1973, let alone extensions to further categories which would involvesubstantial additional work.    Prior consultations with the staff ofboth Departments are therefore essential; and I shall need to1C(74) 47 COPY NO 8121 May 1974CABINET
initiate these at the earliest propitious moment.    But, once theyhave been started, the risks of leakage, with all the attendantembarrassments arising from public pressure, and the possibleappearance of concessions under pressure, are very real.    Bycoming forward with our legislative proposals next month we canminimise these risks.ii. To fit in&apos;with the Christmas rush the Post Office would want to carry out their part of the bonus operation in the week beginning18 November.    This means Royal Assent by the beginning ofNovember in any event.    But, since it was made clear at social services Committee that there was virtually no prospect of any bill receiving Royal Assent by the Summer Recess - even if it only contains the contribution changes - to plan on the basis oftwo separate Bills getting on the Statute Book by early Novemberseems to me quite unrealistic.iii. The inclusion of the bonus provisions in the Bill wouldsweeten the contribution increases which it will be imposing.4. I therefore seek the agreement of my colleagues to including provision for the Christmas bonus in the National Insurance Bill to beintroduced before the Summer Recess.    If continuation of the presentstaff troubles makes it unpropitious to raise this issue with them beforethe present Bill is introduced I will consult my colleagues further.B A department of Health and Social Security21 May 19742
