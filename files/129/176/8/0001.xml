STATUTORY PAY CONTROLS:  USE OF MY CONSENT powers memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. Our announced policy is to move smoothly from statutory paycontrols to voluntary methods, using my limited powers of consent to ease the most exceptional difficulties, while getting those who have madesettlements to stick to them and others to settle at much the same level as hitherto.    The Trades Union Congress (TUC) have issued guidance to member unions which accords with this approach.2.        Depending on the passago of the prices legislation, we may have thepower to abolish the statutory controls at any time from mid-June onwards.I have had a number of informal discussions with Len Murray and with individual union leaders, but it will be some time yet before we get to thepoint of deciding with the TUC and others concerned on the voluntary arrangements to replace the statutory controls.    Given the presentprospect that, at the end of the year, prices will stand 15 per cent higherthan a year before and earnings, as the thresholds are triggered, at 19 to20 per cent, we must try to avoid a further upsurge through an explosion of settlements to remedy grievances at the end of the statutory controls.3.        Many of these difficult pay problems are now being put forward forthe limited use of my consent powers and the Ministerial Sub-Committee on pay Negotiations has been considering how best to handle them in order to ease the way to the voluntary arrangements.    In some cases we have foundsolutions without consents.    There are just four small cases so far where we have decided to proceed with consents, though none has yet had to be formally announced.    But there are some big cases of real difficulty whereconsents might be repercussive, particularly where they involvenegotiating on top of Stage 3 settlements already made.    The Sub-Committeethinks that we should be ready to give consents for Government scientists and to the railways and London underground (and we may have to considerextending this to London buses); but they are divided on the question of whether to grant consents for further increases for teachers, nurses andpostmen.    Annex 1 states what is proposed and the cost in each of thesebig cases (including the possible cost of implementing the Pay BoardJsreport on London Weighting this summer).1C(74) 33 COPY NO    * u29 April 1974CABINET
4, Teachers, nurses and postmen have undoubtedly fallen behind in the earnings race in recent years, but we are agreed that we cannotcontemplate authorising a general pay review.    This would be too costlyand too repercussive.    Nonetheless, there are widespread feelings of grievance among these groups and the risk of trouble if we do nothing tomeet their case.    This is not a matter of just waiting until the controlsare abolished because we shall not want a free-for-all then and our aimmust be to get these people to keep to their normal operative dates, unlessany arrangements for special cases form part of the voluntary agreementwith the TUC.    We are therefore looking for something which might helprelieve the intensity of resentment by allowing these people to start tonegotiate and which, with the London Weighting report in prospect at theend of June to help in an area of acute difficulty, might carry them through to their settlements next year.    It is with this in mind that proposals for selective action have been advanced for these three groups - at a public expenditure cost of around  40 million if something were done for all three.Action for one or more of these groups could also help combat theimpression that might be given by consents for the railways that we areusing this power only for those who can injure the economy.5.        There are, however, two schools of thought on this approach.    Onetakes the view that consents for these selective increases, while adding anunwelcome  40 million to public expenditure, would buy little.   All three groups will benefit in full from threshold payments (likely to give 80pa week from end-May, rising to  1, 60 a week from end-June), and the most hard-pressed of them will no doubt get an increase in London Weighting soon afterthe Pay Board reports in June.    Selective increases 3-6 weeks ahead ofthese wider improvements (and affecting in the case of teachers only10 per cent of the teaching force) would do little to allay discontent andmight increase it among those who do not benefit.    The main effect, it isargued, would be to add to the difficulty of holding pay increases generallyat broadly Stage 3 levels for the rest of the pay round and avoidingreopening of Stage 3 settlements.    Many union leaders would privatelyprefer a minimum of consents because &quot;special cases&quot; add to their difficulties with their own members;  and there is a risk of enfilading theposition the TUC have publicly adopted in their recent circular to memberunions.    The Government expect to have to give consents for railwaymen,the London underground and Civil Service scientists, in addition to the fourminor cases.    If three major consents are added to that list it will be hard to convince many other groups that they are not equally special - examplesin the public sector (and affecting public expenditure) include the police,Post Office clerical and executive staff and the electrical power engineers,but the list could soon lengthen.    Avoiding these consents need not precludea sympathetic announcement about the Briggs Report on Nursing.6.        The contrary view is that it will assist a smooth transition if wedeal with some of the hardest cases in a controlled way now; that we cannotaffor,d to operate the Conservative controls less flexibly than they wereprepared to do with their relativities machinery; that positive action2
clearly designed to ease the manifesto rigidities of the present system will help secure industrial peace at a lower cost than inaction;  and that the selective proposals for teachers, nurses and postmen afford a constructiveapproach, taking account of social justice as well as industrial power,which will help us in urging others to hold back.7.        I share the latter view in general, but from private soundings of union leaders I do not think that we can justify consents in all three cases.Unhappily, I fear that the action in view for postal workers would raiseparticularly acute problems for other union leaders who are trying to avoidpressing their claims as &quot;special cases&quot;.    The other two cases should notcause any great difficulties of this nature if the action was presented as animplication of carrying through our social policies on teaching and nursing,rather than as a straight pay increase.    But the action proposed for teachers is so limited and liable to be taken by them as divisive that theuse of my consent power for this instead of a general review might do more harm than good.    Only the action proposed for nurses seems to escapethese objections.8J        I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that I should be preparedto issue consents as necessary in the cases listed in Annex 1 except for teachers and postal workers.    It is desirable that the Secretary of Statefor Social Services should first announce the policy advances which produce the pay improvements for nurses, so that I may then explain to the house the way we are proceeding on the lines of Annex 2, perhaps adapted as an answer to a written Question,,    This would be helpful as a basis fordissuading others from pressing their claims for consents and for avoidingisolation of the Government scientists&apos; case, on which we may have to announce a decision early next week.M department of Employment29 April 19743
ANNEX 1LIST OF PROPOSED MAJOR CONSENT CASESBRITISH RAILWAYSjTwo issues - restructuring and annual pay claim - areseparately    under arbitration.    When the awards are issued,probably in latter part of May,  current differences between thethree unions will probably disappear behind a common resolve tosecure implementation with an early resort to industrial action ifthere is any delay.The main reason for a consent is that it is the only way tosettle the long-standing dispute and avoid futher expensiveindustrial disruption.    A decision to give a consent for an ex-exceptional increase would be presented on the grounds of government policy to  develop public transport,  especially the railways,  the crucial role of the railways in inter-city, urban commuting and bulkcommodity transport and growing shortage of staff due to un-attractive working conditions, and the long-standing commitment inthe 1972 pay agreement to restructure pay.COST.    This would lie between  32m and  90m in the first full year  (depending on the outcome of the arbitrations) and between 13m and  37m this year.    The entire cost would fall on public expenditure.LONDON TRANSPORT UNDERGROUNDA consent for British Railways would also have to coverLondon underground workers  (same job,  same unions,  sharing of trackand facilities).As in BR,  there are two issues - pay restructuring under a9-point plan    and annual pay claim.    ASLEF alone refuse to accepta Stage 3 increase and have gone to arbitration.    LT have agree the 9-point plan with all three unions.    A consent is needed for implementation of any significant part of the plan above Stage 3*The case for a consent rests on Government policy to developurban public transport,  increasing shortages of staff in LT whichare even greater than in other services, and the vital role of the underground to the economy of London.A consent would raise expectations among London busmen and LTare preparing a special deal for them like the 9-point plan.    ItWould be extremely difficult to distinguish railmen from busmenin London and further consideration is being given to thepracticalities of preventing any consent that might have to extend to London busmen from repercussing nationally.
COST. About  6m (22%) - excluding London busmen, SinceGLC have undertaken to hold fares steady in 197^5 any deficitresulting from the pay increases would fall on rates.TEACHERSThe proposal would be to extend the existing system of selective pay additions to improve the staffing of schools instress,  particularly those in down-town areas of cities  (notablyLondon) where turnover,  especially of experienced teachers,  isunduly high.Numbers of schools of exceptional difficulty and in educationpriority areas  (EPAs)  designated under the previous Labour Governmentare reaching a position of crisis.    They are both understaffed andhave difficulty in attracting and retaining experienced and matureteachers.    They serve substantial numbers of children who aresocially deprived.    These difficulties are &quot;compounded by thespecial problems of immigrant children and the raising of theschool leaving age,  the problems of which cannot be resolved ina year.    The unique feature is that most children who fail torealise their full potential are irreversibly affected.    Theproposal would be presented as an advance in social policy in areas under stress.The improvement would not repercuss on other teachers.    Itmight create some pressures from other workers in EPAs but these could be resisted.    By itself it might not repercuss among other employees generally, but if other groups such as nurses and postalworkers also get selective improvements the chance of others re-opening their settlements is bound to be increased.COST.     10 million (l/o)  falling entirely on rate support grant.It will benefit about 45,000  (lOJi) teachers,  8-9,000 of them inLondon.     (A complete pay review for all teachers to bring them into line with average non manual salary increases since 1965might cost nearly  220 million).NURSES .The proposal would be to make selective improvements in pay which would help in (a) remedying the acute shortage of nui-seteaching staff,   (b) attracting the additional 13,000 staff ultimatelyneeded to replace the reduction in work contribution by learnerin the hospital and (c) maintaining the morale and image of thenursing profession, particularly among existing qualified staffin wards and departments who will be closely involved with theclinical training of the new style students.
(confidential)It would be possible to link the announcement of these improvements to acceptance by the Government of the recommendationsof the Briggs Report on Nursing and this present item as part ofan advance in nursing policy.    About k1% of nurses would benefitthrough increases for qualified staff up to ward sister,  introductionof a second level of ward sister and regarding of tutorial staff.These improvements should not repercuss within nursing, butthe related professions  (physiotherapists etc) would also haveto benefit by equivalent improvements.    By themselves the improvementsmight not repercuss among other employees generally, but the chances of this are increased if teachers and postal workers alsoget selective improvements.COST.     18 million (3%), which would fall on public expenditure.(A general pay review for all nurses might cost about  75 million).POSTAL workers the proposed selective improvements would affect in any yearonly a minority of postal workers  (mainly members of the Unionof Post Office Workers).    They would be an increased payment to easeintroduction of new mechanisation procedures,   extra inducements forbank holiday work,  House of Commons staff and on-call allowances,and extra annual leave related to length of service and negotiatedbefore the standstill for junior staff.AH five improvements, which reflect increases delayed by the standstill,  are designed to alleviate conditions that are producing a cumulative worsening effect on Post Office services;  and, particular-ly in the case of allowances,  to improve rates that have fallenwell behind similar allowances elsewhere.The improvments will do nothing to help the clerical/executive staff who are now taking industrial action to achieve,at least,  parity with the Civil Service.    Their case is not so strong and would have to be resisted and they would probably not object to increases to postmen and telephonists:  but it Arould raisetheir expectations.    Junior clerks would benefit from the leaveimprovements.The improvements do not make up a coherent package with ajustification like teachers and nurses, and are more likely torepercuss on other groups  (eg electrical power engineers and gasstaff) who have selected anomalies they want rectified.    If teachers,nurses and&apos;postal workers all get some selective improvement,there is a greater danger of repercussions.    Equally, postalworkers would react strongly if only teachers and nurses secure an improvement.COST.    Estimated to be within  10m (to be compared with llOm for a complete pay review for all staff and  60m for a lessextensive review).
CIVIL SERVICE AND NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE SCIENTISTSVirtually all non-industrial civil servants - except scientistshave received awards based on pay research.    The 16,000 scientistsfailed to secure an award because they have been     in dispute withthe CSD over the method for determining their pay.    A referenceto the Pay Board provided a means of resolving the dispute; bothsides are committed to accepting the Board&apos;s recommendations.The situation is exceptional in that the scientists have aPay Board report recommending criteria for the determination oftheir pay on the same basis as the rest of the Civil Service.They are shown to be substantially worse off than their workingcolleagues employed by the same employer. tThe increases would necessarily also affect 30,000 scientistsin the NHS, Atomic Energy Authority, Research Councils and otherfringe bodies which are automatic followers.    Private sectoremployers of scientists may well criticise the rises.    Other lesswell paid public sector employers might cite this case to  support their claims.COST.    About  11m (10%)  covering all those affected.LONDON WEIGHTINGThe cost of improving London Weighting generally could be considerable,  since 750,000 people in the public sector and250,000 in the private are paid allowances.COST.    An increase of  100 pa in London weighting costs 100m (0.23% of the national wages bull).    We cannot,predict the findings of the Pay Board&apos;s report due at the end of June,  butthe resultant increases might lie between  100 and  200 pa,thus adding, between 0.25% and 0.5% to the national wages bill.Three quarters of the cost of any improvement would fall to public expenditure.(confidential)
ANNEX 2POSSIBLE ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE HOUSE1.    We want to see a smooth transition from statutory controls to voluntary methods,  using my limited powers of consent to ease themost exceptional difficulties.    As I have said before,  we want thosewho have made settlements on the basis of the present arrangements to stick to them and others to settle at much the same level as thosebefore them.     In this we have received the full co-operation of the tuc, who have honoured their pledge not to press any special casebeyond the miners and who have issued guidance to member unions xdiichis fully in accord with the Government&apos;s approach.2.    It is borne in on me daily how many difficulties are created bythe present controls,  but I have no power to-issue a consent savewhere the circumstances are truly exceptional.    Nonetheless,  I am anxious to do my utmost to relieve grievances and inefficiencieswherever this can be justified in accordance with the legislation;and I have made it my task to consider very carefully the manyrepresentations made to my Department in order to ensure that every case is dealt with fairly.3.   Most cases inevitably have to be rejected,  but I have found myselfjustified,  after due consultation with the Pay Board,  in interveningin the case of Glasgow firemen and Hull freezer trawlers where theharsh anomalies created were exceptional,  and I liave one or two other cases of this nature also under consideration       a food distributorto the Shetlands and English China Clays/.4.    The Government have also decided that their social policy incarrying through the new pattern of education and training for nursesin line with the Briggs report requires immediate implementation ofcertain of those improvements which have pay implications.    Here againI believe that the circumstances are truly exceptional and,  if the outcome of the negotiations related to the implementation of theBriggs report leads to  improvements in nurses&apos;  pay and conditions out.of line with the current controls,   I shall consider with the Pay Boardpermitting their implementation through the consent procedure.5.   Many other cases have been brought to my attention.    Most of them know feel that they too have good grounds for special treatment.I understand their difficulties and I sympathise with them,  but I havenot been able to accept that they are truly exceptional and thereforeallow me to use the consent powers provided by current legislation.I hope that they will recognise,  despite their disappointment,  thatI have tried to be fair in selecting cases for consent and accept that the selection made has been based on the most impartialassessment.    I shall of course consider any new cases that are put to me in exactly the same way.(confidential)
