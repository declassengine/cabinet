ASSISTANCE TO THE CHILEAN AHMED FORCESNote by officials   Commercial and Governmental Commitmentsor Obligations in Respect of Overhaul,Supply and training,    The following paragraphs state the position as it is known to officials.   It is possible that some negotiations have taken placeor are in progress between Chilean authorities and firms in theUnited Kingdom, which would not come to the notice of GovernmentDepartments unless contracts were made and applications for licences(where necessary) were made.   It is thought unlikely however that theseunknown projects would amount to very much.   These notes are not concerned to deal with money that may be at risk if steps are takento interfere with contractual obligations eg ECGD loans, or possibleclaims by firms (including sub-contractors) who might consider thatthey had a case against the Government,WARSHIP SPARES2XoBuneroial obligations.

II    Answers to Parliamentary Questions onArms for ChileForeign and Commonwealth Secretary   -   27 March&quot;..... Existing contracts are being urgently reviewed,but we shall not grant new export licences for arms......&quot;Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary  -   10 April&quot;Her Majesty1s Government have now completed the review ofdefence sales to Chile.     As the House is aware, no newexport licences for arms will be granted under the present government&apos;s policy towards the regime.     But the ships already acquired under existing contracts will be deliveredand spares and equipment relating to those contracts willbe allowed.&quot;Defence Secretary   -   30 April&quot;Details of foreign government&apos;s purchases of defence equipment are regarded as confidential by our customersand publicity, if any, is a matter for them.     Notwith-Istanding current interest in Chile, whose major contracts have already become known, it would be damaging to our future sales prospects world-wide if we were to depart fromthe principle of confidentiality.&quot;CONFIDENTIAL- 5 -
