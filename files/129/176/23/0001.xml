CONCORDEMemorandum by the Lord chancellor.       - The Cabinet at their meeting on 21 March (CC(74) 5th Conclusions,Minute 5) agreed that a Committee of Ministers should be formed toexamine all the issues relevant to the future of the Concorde aircraftproject and supervise discussions with the French Government.    these have been interrupted by the calling of the French Presidential Election;but the new Government can be expected to be ready to resume discussions with us early in June,    Before that happens, we should establish our own view of the project and define our objectives.2.        These negotiations will take place against the background that theproduction of 16 aircraft is already well advanced, with three-quarters ofthe work in the United Kingdom completed.    Of these aircraft, two arebeing used in the development programme and are not saleable withoutrefurbishment, four are on order for Air France (AF) and five for british airways (BA); for the remaining five there are as yet no orders.    Thefirst three aircraft are likely to be delivered to AF and BA by about the endof 1975, and delivery of the rest will be completed within about a yearthereafter.    The French Government have refused to consider the option of cancellation and have proposed the manufacture of a further three aircraft,modified to achieve a marginal improvement in range - making 19 in all.&quot;We have suggested to them that the implications should also be examined of completing eight (the minimum operating fleet for each airline) and 11 aircraft(the number for which orders exist).    But the financial benefits of manufacturing fewer than 16 aircraft are relatively modest, and are likelyto be outweighed by the political disadvantages.    The immediate choicetherefore is whether to go on with the existing programme of 16 aircraft or get out altogether.3.        The Committee has accordingly examined the latest estimates of cost for continuing the project, received reports from officials on the implications of cancelling it, and considered representations received from trades unions and other organisations.    These are summarised in the appendices to thismemorandum.    The main factors to emerge are:-181C(74) 48 COPY NO21 May 1974CABINET
a. About 21, 700 people in the United Kingdom are employed on concorde, of whom about 13, 400 are likely to be made redundant ifthe project were to be cancelled.    Officials recommend that in suchan event there should be a special redundancy scheme, at a cost ofabout  20 million.    The adverse effects of employment and industry generally should be containable, though there would be a serious problem at Bristol, for which special measures are recommended(Appendix B).b. Officials consider that the cancellation of Concorde would nothave a significant effect on the future of the aircraft industry(Appendix C).    The industry itself, however, would regard it as aserious blow to our technology and credibility as a reliable partner.c. A decision to cancel Concorde would be vigorously opposed by the unionst which believe that it would be a grave error,- especially the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions.The Economic Committee of the Trades Union Congress supportsthis view (Appendix D).d. BA&apos;s best estimate - which they accept is subject to a widemargin of error - is that their five Concordes would cause them to incur operating losses totalling  100 million over 10 years(Appendix E).The Committee&apos;s discussions have further established:e. The effect on the balance of payments of a 16 aircraft programme is difficult to quantify, but is not likely to be so large as to be a crucial factor either way.f. Once production has ceased it would be extremely difficultto restart, but it might be possible to extend the production programme - at a cost - if there were a prospect of further airlineorders coming forward after the aircraft entered service.    Someorders would be required for production before the end of 1976.g. Concorde!s noise may still prove critical to its chances: it remains uncertain whether it will be given permission to land at new York, Tokyo or Sydney, or to overfly countries supersonicallyon its routes to Japan and Australia.4. The Law Officers have concluded (C(74) 46) that we are under no obligation to authorise more than 16 aircraft, and would have a good prospectof success in defending a decision to discontinue support for production now on the grounds of a fundamental change of circumstances.    The test of sucha change is the aircraft&apos;a &quot;marketability11: they argue that Concorde isunmarketable because it can only be manufactured and flown at a loss andthere are acknowledged to be no commercial prospects for further sales.The response of the former option holders tends to support this.    On theother hand, the French are likely to argue that marketability can only be tested when the aircraft enters service, and to stop the programme before2
then is unwarranted.    If the issue of liability to continue with the projectwere taken to arbitration and decided against us, the most reliableestimate of the amount of damages that we might have to pay lies betweennil and about  150 million, with a possible intermediate figure of 100 million.    Damages could also be a negotiated figure.5.        The new French President has publicly committed himself to continuing the project.    The next French Government can therefore beexpected to resist cancellation;  and a unilateral decision by the UnitedKingdom to withdraw would provoke a major dispute which would have repercussions in other areas of Anglo-French relations, sour the renegotiation of our membership of the European Economic Community,and imperil the prospect of future collaborative projects.6. The latest estimates of cost are set out at Appendix A.    assuming that, contrary to the Law Officers1 view of our prospects, we were heldliable and had to pay damages to the French, the relative costs of withdrawing or going ahead would be affected by the level of these damages.The cost of completing the 16 aircraft programme is about  360 million, if14 aircraft are sold.    If no damages had to be paid the cost of withdrawalnow is about  120 million.   At the upper end of the estimated range of damages, the cost of cancellation could be as much as  270 million.    Tocontinue the programme beyond 16 aircraft would add further heavy costs.conclusion. The view of the Committee is that the realistic choice lies betweencontinuing with the programme to complete 16 aircraft and stopping entirely.The balance of opinion in the Committee would prefer the project to be cancelled; but if the French Government refuse to acquiesce in this,however reluctantly, the Committee considers that the right course wouldbe to complete 16 aircraft.   Accordingly they recommend that we shouldtake an early opportunity of exploring the new French Governments iews about the project and their attitude to the question of cancellation.    In thelight of those discussions we should then make our decision.    I invite theCabinet to endorse these conclusions.E lord Chancellor^ Office21 May 19743

Appendix B2An interdepartmental group of officials examined the social, generalindustrial and regional implications of cancelling Concorde,The group concluded that if a decision were made to cancel Concorde in the summer of 1974, about 13,400 of the 21,700 people employed on the projectwould he made redundant, at Bristol (8,000), Weybridge (2,500) and Burn (400),with a further 2,500 spread throughout tho Country.   In addition,900 consequential residencies would occur in tho Bristol&apos; area anong supplyand service industries.At both Weybridge and Hum the prospects of other employment were goodj &quot;butat Bristol special measures were justified to reinforce the employment andtraining services available.   These should not take the form of grantingassisted area status to Bristol, because of the repercussions this step wouldhave in South Wales and elsewhere.   The group saw no scope for moving other aircraft or defence work to Bristol to provide employment at the Filton works,but recommended that if a decision were taken to cancel Concorde, urgentdiscussions should be held with the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC),Rolls Royoe and the local authorities to ensure that the land and buildings were released to new enterprises as quickly as possible.   consideration should be given to making finance for new buildings available through thelocal authorities and to the use of Section 8 of the Industry Act 1972.   Fora limited period industrial development certificates should be issued inBristol more freely than hitherto.The group recommended that substantial redundancy payments on top of thestatutory entitlement, at a cost to the Exchequer of about  16 to  22 million,should be made to all BAC and Rolls Royce workers made redundant by the cancellation of the Concorde project-as part of the terminal payments underthe contract.   They also suggested that for a period of 6 months after adecision to cancel Concorde the Department of Employment*s employmenttransfer scheme should be applied to Bristol as though it were an assistedarea (at a cost to the Exchequer of about  800,000), and that the ManpowerServices Commission should be asked to consider the introduction there ofany special training programme that might be.desirable.
Appendix CThe Effect on the Aircraft Industry of Cancelling ConcordeAn interdepartmental group of officials examined the effect which a decisionto cancel Concorde would have on the size and shape of the United Kingdomaircraft industry.The aircraft industry employs about 190,000 people in 3 broadly equalsectors - airframest where the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) andHawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) account for 85 per cent of the sector; aero-engines, almost&apos; entirely Rolls Royce (RR71)? and equipment, in 15 major andmany smaller firms.(The group assessed that the immediate effect of cancellation of Concorde in1974 would be -a. Airframes.   The loss of 10,000 out of 63,000 jobs, almost entirely,in the commercial division of BAC8   The rest of the industry would however be unaffected.b. aero engines.   Loss of 3,100 jobs out of 59,000 in RR71.c. Equipment. Loss of 3,200 out of 70,000 jobs; the lost jobs wouldbe dispersed through a large number of firms, which would individuallybe little affected.d. A balance of 5,400 jobs would be lost amongst subcontractors andother firms.The group concluded that the Concorde programme thus represented only asmall part of the load on the aircraft industry, most of whose work would beunaffected by its cancellation.   The longer term future of the industry waBmore uncertain, but depended less on the Concorde programme than on thesuccess of other current project-us, the possibility of finding new civilprojects, and the outcome of the defence review.   The industry seemed boundto contract, but should continue to operate effectively at least for thenext 10 years.   Further study was needed of how this contraction should be handled.   Meanwhile the group recommended that work should be put in handon merging the main airframe interests (reducing the number of design teams),on studies to reduce overheads, mainly through the use of fewer sites, andon obtaining more sub-contract work to make use of surplus productive.capacity.3SECRET
APPENDIX DFollowing -fche Secretary of State for Industry&apos;s statement in Parliament on18 March, representations have &quot;been received from -The Lord Mayor of Bristol and delegation of local interests the Economic Committee of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)The Economic Planning Council for the South West RegionThe Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions (CSEU)The British Aircraft corporation the Society of British Aerospace companies and a number of local industrialists, trade; union leaders, and the Bishop,   Mostsupport continuing with the project:   only 2 - the Anti-Concorde Project andthe Federation of Heathrow Anti-Noise Groups want cancellation.The TUC have strongly urged the need to carry on at least until the aircraftenters   service and the damaging effects of cancellation on employment and theaircraft industry, and have stressed the uncertainties to which BritishAirways1 (BA*s) forecasts of operating losses must be subject.   The CSEUargue strenuously the technological achievement that Concorde represents,challenges BA&apos;s assessment, and warns that the CSEU &quot;will not passively allow the cancellation or rundown of this important project&quot;.   The Economic planning council draws attention to the grave adverse consequences for the region of releasing a large number of skilled workers, either from cancellation or fromclosing the programme at 16 aircraft.
other general arguments advanced in favour of Concorde are -i*     supersonic passenger aircraft will come, even if we pull out now;hut we shall have sacrificed our   lead;ii*   the waste of skilled resources implied by cancellation, and serious damage to our engineering reputation, which would affect many of ourexports5iii, the launching of new technology is always expensive, but thereturn comes over a long period;iv*   our reliability as a partner in collaborative ventures, upon whichwe must increasingly rely for future aircraft projects,, would be severely damaged by a unilateral withdrawal.
APPENDIX EBRITISH AIRWAYS * APPRAISAL OP CONCORDEBritish Airways (BA) have said that they do not disagree with the British aircraft corporation^ claim that Concorde operations hy themselves, and given allfavourable assumptions, could prove   profitable.   In evaluating the effect ontheir finances of operating Concorde they assumed as their basic case thatthey and Air Prance (AP) would be the sole operators, and that favourableassumptions about routes, fares and the reaction of their competitors would all be met.   On this basis they estimate that they would break even on Concordeoperations alone (with a load factor of 55 per cent), but that some Concordepassengers would be drawn from their own subsonic operations, and the effectof this would be to worsen their overall results in a typical year &quot;by about 9 million.   On more pessimistic assumptions, eg if Concorde were unable to offer a competitive service on long-haul routes and if the projected levels of new business failed to materialise, these results might be worsened by up to 40 million in a typical year; BA,s best judgement between these extremes isa deterioration of about  25 million in a typical year.If 16 aircraft are constructed, 5 will be available for other airlines to operate in direct competition with BA.   On that basis, on favourable assumptionsBAfs Concorde operations are estimated to lose  6 million in a typical yearand on less favourable assumptions,  29 million; their best estimate is a deterioration of  27 million.   This amount, adjusted to exclude any allowance for depreciation of capital investment and reduced to 1974 prices, producesthe total loss of  110 million over 10 years quoted in Appendix A.APfs most recent estimate of Concorde operations without supersonic competitionpredicts an operating loss of  16 million in a typical year.   BA estimate, onthe basis of information made known in confidence to them by AF, that theresults of APfs own subsonic operations would also bo l^oraened by about 16 million per annum.
