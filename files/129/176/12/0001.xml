1. The inclusion of the Alkali Inspectorate in the new organisation to be set up under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Bill was discussed at Home Affairs Committee on 3 May.    I was unable to attend; butunderstand that the Committee accepted a proposal by the Secretary ofState for the Environment that the clauses in the Bill affecting theinclusion of the Alkali Inspectorate should be deleted, and that insteadthere should be a power by order to apply the BiU&apos;s provisions at some future date to the field covered by the Alkali Act and Inspectorate.2. This proposal goes considerably beyond what I understood to bethe suggestion put to me by the Secretary of State for the Environment,namely, that those parts of the Bill which affect the work of the AlkaliInspectorate should not be activated until the Working Party on AirPollution which he proposes to set up has reported.3.        I feel strongly that either course would be a serious mistake:a. My Bill is now in Standing Committee.    It follows on thismatter the recommendations of the Robens Report (1972), the consultative Proposals (1973) and the Bill introduced by theprevious Government.    A change of the kind proposed, madeon the grounds that another Inquiry is to be set up, would bedifficult to defend.b. It is true that a Conservative backbench amendment hasbeen put down to delete Alkali Act matters from the Bill.    Thisreflects pressure from certain elements within the CBI (but not all) who have made it plain that they are worried at the prospectof the stronger powers of the Bill being available to controlharmful emissions from heavy industry.    This known attitudedoes not commend itself to the TUC, to our supporters in theHouse, or to the public, who want action now; and who would regard the change as weakening the comprehensiveness and enabling powers of a Bill brought forward by the previous government.COPY NO       -   ,1C(74) 377 May 1974CABINET\HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ETC. BILLPOSITION OF THE ALKALI INSPECTORATEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Employment
c.    To insert in the Bill a power by order to extend its application to the matters covered by the Alkali Inspectoratewould in my view serve only to emphasise that we areundecided and that we have no concrete alternative policies to offer (since the proposed Inquiry by a Working Party, and subsequent consideration   of its Report, are likely to take some considerable time).    We should be openly deprivingourselves of a means of meeting public demands for strongercontrols over unhealthy emissions to the air from industry.And we should be leaving the Alkali Inspectorate isolated,and, together with those with whom they deal, in a protractedstate of uncertainty about the future.    It seems unreasonable to ask Parliament to proceed with legislation on this basis.4. Presentational considerations apart, the arrangements proposedby the Secretary of State for the Environment would in my view produce a thoroughly unsatisfactory position.    It is a fundamental purpose ofthe new legislation that the new organisation should have responsibilityfor ensuring that the health and safety of the public is not injured by the direct effects of industrial activity.   All air emissions (including theparticular ones dealt with by the Alkali Inspectorate) which areprejudicial to health will in any case be covered by the Bill.    The new organisation will require expertise in this field, and if the AlkaliInspectorate do not join it, it will have to build up its own.    The present unsatisfactory division of functions between the Factories Inspectorateand the Alkali Inspectorate will thus be further complicated.5.        As a compromise to meet the concern of the Secretary of Statefor the Environment I suggest the following:-The Alkali Inspectorate, and responsibility for the Alkali Act,should be transferred to the new Health and Safety Commission.The Alkali Inspectorate should remain an identifiable groupwithin the new organisation, and the Commission should beresponsible to the Secretary of State for the Environment fortheir work.    We should, however, say that a general study ofarrangements concerning air pollution will be carried out, andthat this might in due course indicate the desirability of someadjustments in the Commission^ responsibilities.6.        This course would avoid the appearance of indecision, and wouldenable the Alkali Inspectorate to play its part in establishing an effectivenew organisation;  whilst at the same time keeping longer-term optionsopen.M department of Employment7 May 1974
