DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 43v   &apos; COPY NO14 May 1974CABINETTHIRD INTERIM REPORT OF THE TOP salaries review BODYMemorandum by the Lord President of the council at the Ministerial meeting held on 26 April to discuss the thirdinterim report of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) the payment ofconsequential increases arising from the 1972 TSRB: report andincrements far members of Nationalised Industry Boards, it was agreedthat we should agtfee to the last two items and accept the main recommenda-tions in the TSRB;third interim report.    However, we felt that I should ask the Chairman of the Review Body if he would see objection to therecommendation regarding threshold agreements being rejected.2. Those of us at the Ministerial meeting were concerned that theTrade Unions would be unfavourably disposed towards a threshold agreement for the higher paid, and that if we were seen to be agreeing with thisrecommendation, it could make our task of setting up a voluntary incomes policy that much more difficult.3.        I have discussed this question with Lord Boyle.    He explainedthat the Review Body had thought it right to recommend that all theprovisions permitted by the Pay Code should be payable.    He also told :me that, -while he could not speak for the other members and he hopedthey would not over-react, there would undoubtedly be dissatisfaction if,for the first time, one of their recommendations were rejected.    Theother Review Bodies would also be concerned.4. The argument for rejecting the threshold provision is undoubtedly a strong one; however, on balance, I recommend that the(TSRB&apos;s)proposals should be implemented in full.E privy Council Office14 May 1974
