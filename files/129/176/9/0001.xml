RECOGNITION FOR EXTRA EFFORT BY DEPARTMENTOF HEALTH AND SOCIAL SECURITY STAFF INVOLVEDIN UPRATING OF PENSIONS AND OTHER social security benefits memorandum by the Secretary of State&apos; for Social services. My colleagues will remember that, at the meeting cf theCabinet on 25 April, I reported orally my extreme concern at theimpasse that I have reached with the Staff Side of my Department onaccount of the urgent work involved in the pensions up-rating operation(CC(74) 12th Conclusions, Minute 3).    I was invited to hold further discussions with the other Ministers most closely concerned and to makea further report.. .) . 11     it2. The difficulties with my staff reflect the situation that has developed over a long period and is related partly to the distastefulnature of much of the work connected with the administration of meanstested benefits, and partly with the extent to which, under successive governments, the introduction of new benefits or changes in the ratesof existing benefits have put an amount of complex additional work on thestaff of local offices which they were not well equipped to carry.    Thisled to a ban on overtime in the autumn of 1972 because the staff at grassroots were convinced that their numbers were inadequate, and gavespecial intensity and bitterness in this Department to the industrial action over pay in the spring of 1973.    Executive Committees are now more militant in their attitudes than in the past and associationrepresentatives are under instructions not to accept additions ofespecially burdensome work unless extra staff can be recruited andtrained.3. In this situation, a very tight timetable for pensions uprating,(13 weeks instead of 18) at a time of year including the Easter and SpringBank Holidays and the start of the summer leave season, has evokeda particularly unfavourable response.    At the beginning of April theStaff Side put to me a four-point package on which they asked forsatisfaction before their members could be expected to do the amountof overtime work needed for the uprating.    Three of these points1C(74) 34 COPY NO       7930 April 1974CABINET
related to matters (staff numbers, accommodation and career prospects)on which I could offer something but, particularly on the last, not enough to lead the staff to feel that their difficulties were beingrecognised.    The remaining item, a request for a once only cash bonusover and above the normal overtime rates, seemed to present over-whelming difficulties of repercussions elsewhere.    It was for that reason that I sought the alternative of a small amount of extra leave ortime off for those who had to work substantial overtime in connectionwith the uprating.    The Ministerial Sub-Committee on Pay, however,rejected this proposal at their meeting on 24 April, and I thus had too little to offer to the Staff Side when I met them on 25 April to carrythem with me.    That was the situation that I reported to the Cabinetlater that morning, together with the fact that the overtime ban, whichhad started on 22 April, was receiving very general support in mostparts of the country, and especially strong support in Scotland and onMersey side.4. The position feae now worsened significantly.    The Society ofCivil Servants, representing the Executive grades, have decided tomaintain the ban on overtime work connected with the uprating that hadalready been introduced on 22 April, but the Civil and Public ServicesAssociation, representing 70 per cent of the staff in local offices are going further than this and have decided: -a. to ban all overtime work;b. to refuse to co-operate with any casual staffrecruited to help with the uprating exercise;c. to ban work on the uprating exercise even in normal hours.The last of these is obviously especially serious and, if persisted in,can only lead to a sharp confrontation between staff and managementwith the possibility of disciplinary action being necessary.    Such aban, if generally observed and persisted in, would make the wholeup-rating operation impossible until a settlement had been reached.Clerical staff at Newcastle Central Office are already taking the line that pensioners1 13 week order books should not be issued at the newhigher rates, - a situation which could only be remedied sooner or later at the cost of still more extra work by over-stamping them in local offices.5.        Two other features exacerbate the situation:-i.       The Civil Service Department have run into difficulty with the National Staff Side over settling and announcing anew agreement on overtime rates, backdated to 1 January,which would offer a very worthwhile improvement.2
ii.       Both the Society of Civil Servants and the Civil andPublic Services Association have their Annual Conferencesin the week after next, and, if this dispute remains unsettledthen, they may well tie themselves to militant resolutions which will shackle their freedom of action over the ensuingyear.6.        In these circumstances, I have had further discussions with the/i/secretary of State for&apos; Employment and the Minister of State for theCivil Service Department.    They both see continuing difficulties about any grant of leave or time off because of the rvpcmnsulre effects, and because of the political difficulties of making an award of this kind theobject of a special consent.    I understand these difficulties, although I do not accept that they are overriding in a situation in which a centralpart of the Governmenfs social policy is being put at risk.   TheSecretary of State for Employment has suggested that we should examineas an alternative the possibility of getting National Staff Side agreement for the use of a part of the flexibility margin under the Pay Code to beused to help the staff of my Department.    If this could be done, itwould be a way of meeting the request for a cash bonus, but there are considerable difficulties about it, not least because to put such aproposition formally to the National Staff Side would in effect commit usto a cash paymenr, even if they refused to find it from the flexibilitymargin.    I therefore think that we ought not to go down this road but to reconsider the possibility of a leave bonus on the lines already discussed in the Ministerial Subcommittee on pay.7. This is a situation of acute difficulty.    I am most concerned that,if we cannot resolve it within the next ten days, we shall move to aposition where the uprating may be put at risk indefinitely and therelations between Ministers and their departmental staffs may besoured for a long time to come.7.        I invite my colleagues:i.       To take note of the situation.ii.       To agree that every effort must be put into reachingsome agreement during the week beginning 6 May, preferablyby the offer of a leave bonus, coupled, if possible, withannouncement of the new national overtime agreement.B A department of Health and Social Security30 April 19743
