POLICY TOWARDS CHILEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs. In summing up the discussion on policy towards Chile at the defence and Oversea. Policy Committee held on 21 March the Prime Minister asked me to make an assessment of the attitude of the United States Governmentto the situation in Chile, and in particular whether they foresaw andfavoured a return to democratically elected government.2,        I thought it prudent to wait until the Latin American foreign ministers had had their meeting with Dr Kissinger in Washington on17-18 April.    Had there been any impending changes in United States andLatin American policy towards Chile they would have been brought out atthis meeting.    In fact there were none.3.        I attach as Annex A a brief assessment which has been prepared inconjunction with HM Embassy at Washington.L J foreign and Commonwealth Office29 April 1974C(74) 32 COPY NO       f g29 April 1974CABINET
ANNEX APOLICY TOWARDS CHILE:    UNITED STATES ATTITUDES1.     The United States Government&apos;s attitude towards the chilean Government appears to be determined chiefly by thedesire:(a)   not to push the regime further to the right, thus reducing the chances of an eventual return to consti-tutional rule;/(b)   notwithstanding Chile&apos;s internal policies, to includeher in the &quot;good partner&quot; policy for the Americaslaunched by Dr Kissinger last October, which was given further impetus by the meeting of hemispheric foreign ministers, including the Chilean, in Washington on17/18 April.     On that occasion Dr Kissinger observed&quot;The United States will not seek to impose its politicalpreferences and . . . will not intervene in the domestic affairs of its Western hemisphere neighbours&quot;.2.     The State Department consider that the Chilean militaryregard themselves as having been unwillingly forced by eventsinto intervening in politics and are determined to pushthrough their plans for economic reconstruction, before turningthe Government back to the politicians.     Pinochet has spoken of a 5-year minimum period as being necessary for this.However, the Junta have set up a constitutional draftingcommission whose first report provides for a constitutionalframework similar to the previous one (ie under Frei andAllende) except that the Congress would be strengthenedvis-a-vis the executive.     The report also provides for a run-off election between Presidential candidates on theFrench model.3.     The State Department believe that the sooner the economy is put right the sooner are democratic forms likely to be restored.     American economic assistance and military aidwill therefore continue.     The State Department are at presentdrawing up plans for fiscal year 1975 and will be proposing to Congress two further loans for Chile designed to replace those disbursed during the Allende administration.     PL480assistance (subsidised foodstuffs) will also continue.4.     The United States Government have made representations to the Junta about refugees and human rights both throughthe US Embassy in Santiago and via the Red Cross, the UNHigh Commissioner for Refugees and voluntary agencies.     these have been deliberately pitched in a low key since the Juntaare, in the State Departments view, proud and touchy and quite capable of reacting to criticism with still tougher/internal policies.
internal policies.     They have detected some responsivenesson the Junta&apos;s part.     Pinochet and his colleagues recentlyaccepted representations from various visitors, including USCongressmen, to an extent the State Department would not have expected even three months ago.     The State Department expect the current political trials to provoke more adverse publicity.However they doubt if the Chileans, who say they are basingthemselves on legislation in force since 1925 (used also byFrei and Allende) and tend by. nature to be legalistic, wouldbe prepared to modify sentences for the sake of their inter-national image.     We share this doubt.5.     Congressional interest in Chile has been remarkablysmall.     Senator Kennedy&apos;s views are not widely &quot;shared, evenby fellow Democrats.     Liberal circles in the United Statesnaturally deplore all coups, such as that in Chile, butconcern for human rights has in practice been largely directedelsewhere:    eg towards Greece.     Press comment, thoughreasonably extensive, has apportioned criticism fairly evenlybetween the Junta&apos;s excesses and the unwisdom of policiespursued by the Allende administration before its overthrow.6.     Another important consideration for the United states in determining their policy towards Chile is linked with the wider security problem in Latin America.     The americans would be greatly concerned by any outbreaks of hostilities between Chile and Peru or Bolivia and probably see keepingChile within the present political and security framework(of the Organization of American States) as the best guarantee against conflict.7.     The Americans are likely to try to minimise the latentrisk of hostilities between Chile and Peru.     To this endwe believe that they will consider taking steps to maintain a military balance between the two countries.     In thisconnection, Peru has recently taken delivery of Sovietarmour and has a larger air force than Chile.     Chile, onthe other hand, is stronger at sea.     In this connection,the State Department have commented to our Embassy that theDepartment had been relieved to learn of HMG&apos;s recent decision not to cancel defence supplies for Chile already in the pipeline.
