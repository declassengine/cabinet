NATIONAL INSURANCE bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. As announced in the Business Statement on 4 April, proceedings onthe National Insurance Bill (intended to be all stages) are to be the business in the Commons on Wednesday 10 April.    The Bill, as well as providing forthe increases in national insurance benefits and contributions, contains a clause (Clause 5) giving effect to our commitment to link long-termbenefit increases subsequent to the achievement of the  10- 16 level to increases in average earnings; and it provides that the increase due as aresult of next year&apos;s review must come into operation not later than theweek beginning with the last Monday in July - that is 12 months after the operative date of this year&apos;s increases.    Clause 5 does this by amending inour predecessors&apos; Social Security Act 1973 the section - section 39 - which provides for the annual upratings to become effective in the second half ofNovember; but it substitutes the end of July only for 1975, and says nothingabout subsequent years.    This is in accordance with the decision of theCabinet on 28 March (CC(74) 7th Conclusions, Minute 4).2.        As my colleagues are aware it seems likely that the Opposition, inaccordance with the commitment in their Election Manifesto, will put down for &quot;Wednesday an amendment or new clause substituting six-monthlyupratings from April 1975 for our annual ones; and that the Liberals arelikely to support them in this,    (For technical reasons it would not be easy to legislate for six-monthly upratings before April 1975).    The Chief Whipdoes not think that, if such an amendment or new clause were moved, itcould be successfully resisted.    We shall not be likely to see the actualterms of what they wish to put down until next Wednesday, given that all stages are to be on that day; and there is I am advised doubt as to whether anything designed to secure six-monthly upratings would be within the scopeof the money resolution.3,        If the amendment or new clause is ruled out of order, that is the endof the matter, though there would no doubt be a difficult debate on Clause 5stand part.    There is also, I suppose, some risk of a subsequent defeat onthe point in the Lords but in that event, we would need to deal with thatproblem on its merits later.C(74) 26 COPY NO    788 April 1974CABINET
4.        Assuming, however, that the Opposition somehow contrive an amendment or new clause which is in order, the question which arises -and on which I have been in touch with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Chief Whip following the Cabinet&apos;s decision on 4 April - is what should then be our course.    It seems to us that it would, in those circumstances,be inevitable to make the best of a bad job, while attaching the maximum possible odium to the Opposition.    As my colleagues are aware from our discussions on 28 March, there are strong arguments both of principle andof operational convenience for moving the annual uprating back from July tothe autumn; and these arguments would apply also, if we were to move overto two upratings a year, to one of them.    If, therefore, it became the inevitable thing to accept the principle of six-monthly upratings, I think weshould seize the opportunity of the change to the Bill which would be needed for this purpose to provide that the annual uprating in July 1975should be replaced by a commitment to six-monthly upratings in April and october each year starting from April 1975.    I would oppose six-monthlyupratings with the arguments in paragraphs 5 and 6 below, but, if we werenonetheless likely to be defeated, I would propose to undertake to put downin the Lords appropriate amendments to section 39 of the Social SecurityAct 1973 in place of those effected by Clause 5 of the Bill and cf theOpposition^ amendment or new clause (which would almost certainly be technically defective in any event).FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS5. The odium to be pinned on the Opposition to which I refer inparagraph 4 is the extra cost of six-monthly upratings.    This would - asis shown in more detail in Annex I - be  250 million in 1975-76, on theassumption of a 20 per cent a year rise in earnings from this summer;and involve substantial extra sums, depending on the future rate of therise in earnings, thereafter.    Additional contributions would be needed;and other important purposes, such as disability and child endowmentprovision, might be hindered,    I think we should make the maximumimpact we can with these facts.    I should also add that six-monthlyupratings must inevitably mean that the one due to become operative inApril of each year, which would have to be settled by early December,would have to be divorced from the Budget.OPERATIONAL ASPECTS6. The operational aspects of six-monthly upratings are set out in annex U.    This would involve a permanent addition to the Departmentsstaff which is unlikely to be less than 2f 500 to 3, 000 - possibly more when a detailed assessment has been made, including an assessment of the extrawork which the Department may have to undertake in implementing other policy developments.    There will be recruiting and accommodationdifficulties, and to make possible an uprating taking effect next April,recruitment and other preparations would have to start at once, andoverriding priority will need to be given to this.    Even so, there could beconstraints next year on the possibility of accommodating other policy changes which had significant administrative content.
B A department of Health and Social Security8 April 197437.        I invite my colleagues to agree that if, but only if, the course ofevents in the proceedings on the National Insurance Bill on 10 April makesthis inevitable I should announce our intention to amend the Bill in the lords so as to provide for six-monthly upratings in April and October eachyear beginning in April 1975.
COST OF SIX-MONTHLY UPRATINGS1.   Uprating of benefits every six months instead of every year would result in higher expenditure because the rates ofbenefit would be higher in the second half of the twelve-monthlyperiod between normal annual upratings.1975-762.   On the assumption that earnings rise at the rate of about20 per cent a year from the summer of 1974, six-monthly upratingswould cause extra expenditure from the National Insurance funds in 1975-76 of about  250 million.   This is equivalent to about an extra 0.5 per cent increase on the joint rate of contributionpayable under the Social Security Act 1973, to be split betweenemployee and employer (say 0.2 per cent from the employee and 0.3 per cent from the employer).   There would also be an extra  40million expenditure on the non-contributory benefits financed fromthe Consolidated Fund.1976-77 and later years.   The extra expenditure for 1976-77 and later years would dependon the rate of the rise in earnings.   If, for example, earningsrose at a long-term rate of 12 per cent, benefit expenditure inany year would be 3 per cent higher as a result of six-monthlyupratings (ie about  200 million in 1976-77 terms, but increasingeach year). r
ANNEX 2/ This is on the assumption that legislation would have provided for theupratings to be carried out by the affirmative resolution procedure.PEASHILITT OF TWICE YEARLY UPRATINGSTIMETABLING CONSTRAINTS1.    These are:-1.    The length of the programme needed to give effect to changes in rates which for a straightforward uprating, is:-(a) The preparatory period prior to Announcement which is needed to calculate and obtain agreement to allthe subsidiary rates (which can  only be done once the main rates have been fixed). - 2 weeks(b) The time needed from Announcement to the start of the operational period which is needed for overtpreparations (eg the issue of instructions to local offices) and for the introduction of legislation - 2 weeks(c) The operational period during which the new ratesappropriate to each beneficiary are calculatedand new or revised instruments of payment are issued    - 13 weeks2.    The desirability, from Inland Revenue standpoint, that changes intaxable benefits should where possible coincide with the beginningof the tax year.3.    The advisability of spacing the two upratings evenly to avoidpressure for further increases if the period between A-days werelonger in one part of the year than the other.2.    On this basis a typical timetable would be:- /Uprating (l) Uprating (2)Week commencing Week commencingMain rates fixed by: (say) 9 December 9 JuneANNOUNCEMENT (say) 16 December 23 JuneOperation starts (say) 6 January 7 july-DAY (say) 7 April 6 October3*    The above timetable applies to a straightforward uprating.   If therewere any special tasks - such as changes in supplementary benefit disregards -a longer operational period would be needed with a correspondingly earlierannouncement.   This could best be accommodated in the Autumn uprating.
ADDITIONAL STAFF AND OTHER RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING THEIR HECESSARY BUILD-UP4.    Much of the work of uprating benefits and of other special reassessments, egto take aocount of rent, rates changes etc, is at present carried out by casualstaff and by overtime.   It would be unwise, however, to rely on the employmentof casuals on a large scale for a second uprating because students - who aretraditionally used in late summer to do straightforward supplementary benefitupratings - would not be available in the Spring and overtime could not be a substitute in view of the amount which would be required.   It would be necessary,therefore, to convert most of the manpower requirement into permanent posts.The additional staff needed would be subject to more detailed assessment be unlikely to be less than 2500-3000:-LOCAL OFFICESSupp BenCB2500NEWCASTLEBLACKPOOLTOTAL(say)(say)60402600An additional 130,000hours by casual staff and/or overtime wouldbe needed*plus some overtime3.    It takes some time to recruit and train additional staff in these numbers and a lead-time of about nine souths would be needed to bring the Department to astate of readiness for twice yearly upratings.   For example for an uprating inthe Spring of 1975 authority for the additional posts and for the start of recruitment would be needed by about the end of May this year.6.    The accommodation of the additional staff required would present problems in local offices many of which are at present already seriously under-accommodated.Superimposing further increases of the order envisaged in para five would make it essential that, if and when plans and requirements are put to DOE, Ministerialassurances are given that our needs would reoeive overriding priority both as toresources and finance to obtain the additional space, particularly in the officesalready in sub-standard accommodation.* If converted to permanent posts this would amount to 400 staff. However, the much shorter CB operation would mean that it would be difficult to keep themfully employed throughout the year and as much of the work is the routineoverstamping of order books this is probably best left on a casual basis.The Blackpool proposals mean there will be no overstamping of WP and AA order books.   This will be to some extend offset, by the need to uprate I7B and MAorder books but there may ultimately be some net saving in this requirement.
7.    Twice-yearly upratings would increase the Department&apos;s paper usage and urgent printing requirements for order books , forms, leaflets and envelopes.In the present conditions of world paper shortage and pressure in the printingindustry this would increase the already severe strain on EHSO and over-ridingpriority on the available resources would be needed to enable this Departmentto meet a twice-yearly commitment.INTERACTION WITH INCOME TAX8.    As it is desirable for Inland Revenue to apply tax to the new rate of retirement pension etc from the beginning of the tax year, it would seemsensible to ensure that pension rates were increased from the pay day nearest to6 April.3
