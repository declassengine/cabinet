POLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF SPECIAL ADVISERS TO minister&apos;s memorandum by the Prime Minister1. On 2 May last my Private Secretary, on my instructions,circulated a memorandum of guidance on arrangements for the appointmentof special advisers to Ministers,    This memorandum, which had beenprepared after discussion in a group of senior Ministers, included thefollowing paragraph on the political activities of special advisers:&quot;The rules governing the political activities of civilservants are set out in Estacode Ka 45-56.    They will normallyapply to special advisers without exception.    In particular, anadviser must not allow himself to be adopted as a Parliamentarycandidate without first resigning his appointment as an adviser,or having arrangements made to be remunerated from non-public funds.    Special advisers may not offer themselves for election toor serve as members of local authorities whilst they areremunerated from public funds&quot;.2.        Most of the special advisers appointed since the Election are being paid from public funds.    It clearly helps to establish their status in deparments, their access to officials and their value to Ministers if theyare so paid.    But - and this is the point that we had in mind in reachingour conclusions on political activities of special advisers - they are in aprivileged position in relation to Ministers, in which they are ^attractingand will continue to attract some Parliamentary and political attention.We considered it essential that it should be beyond question that their primary and overriding loyalty and duty is to their Ministers and theGovernment, and therefore desirable to minimise the risks of conflict ofinterest and confusion of loyalties, and the risks of public criticism oftheir position which could be politically damaging.PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATES3.        In relation to special advisers who are Parliamentary candidates,we took the view that they required a degree of freedom to dispose of their time, as well as freedom to speak in public, which was not consistent withtheir being or continuing to be paid from public funds.1-81C(74) 41 COPY NO     0 x14 May 1974CABINET
10 Downing Street14 May 197424. In relation to special advisers who are elected members of localauthorities we considered that there were clear and definite possibilitiesof conflicts of interest, particularly for special advisers to Ministers with responsibilities in the field of relations between central and localGovernment.    There must be no ground for doubting that the primary andoverriding loyalty of a special adviser, paid from public funds is to his minister.    We therefore concluded that special advisers paid from public funds could not serve as members of local authorities.5. Two members of the Cabinet have special advisers who are atpresent paid from public funds, on the basis of arrangements made beforethe memorandum of guidance was issued, and who are members of localauthorities.    These Ministers think that the rule is unduly restrictive,and have represented to me that it is not necessary to insist on them eitherresigning from their authorities or being paid from other than public funds.They argue that special advisers are in a different position in this respectfrom civil servants who continue in office on a change of Government.They draw attention to the difficulty of requiring their special advisers to resign from their local authorities or of finding other sources from public funds for their remuneration as special advisers.6.        I understand these difficulties, and I recognise that there is a balance of considerations here, which I must now ask the Cabinet to resolve.7. In considering this matter the Cabinet will wish to have in mind thecase of a special adviser appointed by the last Government to a Departmentwhich does not have close official contacts with local authorities and paid from public funds, who was a member of a county council.    This case wasthe object of questions to the last Prime Minister; I attach a copy of the relevant extract from Hansard (Official Report, 11 February 1971,volume 811, no 82, columns 784-786).    Following that exchange in theHouse, the adviser in question was required to give up his membership ofthe county council.H W
HANSARD - Official Report Volume 811, No. 82, Cols 784 - 786Thursday, 11 February, 1971f       CIVIC SERVANTS (PARTY.   .     POLITICAL ACTIVITY)&apos; &apos;Ql. Mr. Sheldon asked the Primej Minister what action he is taking to ensure; that those appointed to the Civil service by his own authority do not engage ini parly political activity.! Tltc Prime  Minister  (Mr.  Edwardj Heath): There are well-known rules gov-. crning the political activities of civil scr-; Yants which all are expected to observe.V Mr. Sheldon: While not wishing to&quot;limit the useful role played by outsidersI coming into the Civil Service, may II ask the right hon. Gentleman whether heI is aware that the full-time paid employ-j ment in the Civil Service of someone whoj has played a leading part in party politicsi in a prominent local authority is a depar-ture from existing practice?  Should noti this departure be at least notified to theHouse?The Prime Minister: Under past&apos; Administrations people of known political! views and activities have been broughtI into the Government. The rule is veryI clear, and it is that civil servants of thej &quot;grade of executive officer and above may take part in local political activities with: &quot;the permission of their department. &apos; As1 far as I know, this rule has been observed, in every case. If people are taking part&apos; in local government or local activities, itj is with the permission of their department.-Mr. Harold Wilson: Is the Prime&quot;Minister aware that the rules clearly laidii down by Lord Attlee&apos;s Government have&quot; been followed ever since and have beenVery strictly applied? Is he further aware that in the case of an appointment toNo. 10 Downing Street on 1st January,1969, an incoming temporary civil servant,Who was a member of a local authority,not only was required to resign his seaton a local authority immediately, by mydirection, but was not even allowed toattend the following evening to tender his resignation in person? Obviously thereis a .very big difference in the way inwhich this matter is being handled asbetween the Labour and ConservativeGovernments.The Prime Minister: I do not think&quot; that there is any difference at all. I knownothing of the case to which the rightboa. Gentleman refers. But it would: appear that the person concerned mustcither have asked for permission to con-tinus and have been refused cr must havedecided not to go on with his activities.Anyone engaged in local government acti-vities or local political activities is fullyentitled to ask the department for per-mission to continue, and it must be the,department which decides whether he can continue. ...Mr. Wilson: Is the right ban. Gentle-man aware that I should be extremely-happy if he looked up all thi papers inthat case? I will give him all the infor-mation he needs. Perhaps he will say whether anyone who has been at No. 10,in the Cabinet Office or the Treasury, ina senior administrative position, has notbeen required immcdialeiy to resign-any local government appointment he held?The Prime Minister: Obviously Ishould have to search the records in orderto answer that question. But the pointof principle remains that anyone belowexecutive officer grade can continue his activities without permission, and that anyone of executive officer grade or abovemay, under the present rules, ask for permission to continue his activities, andit would rest with the head of the Gov-crnment to decide whether it was appro-priate for him to do so. That policy h3sbeen pursued.Mr, Wilson: The rules have been applied very strictly by all Governmentsfrom Lord Atllee&apos;s day onwards. If itis a fact, as the right hon. Gentleman says,that he is using the discretion of givingor refusing approval in the way that he isdoing, it is a very considerable deterioration-tion in the standards which have been applied by every previous Government. .The Prime Minister: These matters are-decided by the head of the department-and not by me as head of the Govern1ment. As far as I know, no case hasbeen referred to me as head of the Gov-ernment. The decisions have been takenin the normal way by the department concerned in any cases which have arisen.
