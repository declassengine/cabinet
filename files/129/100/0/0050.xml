secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March I960C. (60) 50 Copy No.16th March, 1960CABINET57BROADCASTING IN THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe Home Affairs Committee have agreed that I should submit the following proposals to Cabinet:(a) that an enquiry by an Independent Committee into future broadcasting policy should be instituted during 1960, and(b) that the British Broadcasting Corporation^ Charter and Licence, whichexpires on 30th June, 1962, should be extended to 29th July, 1964, tocoincide with the expiry of the Television Act.2. I am setting out in Annex A the problems on which I should expect theIndependent Committee to make recommendations.3. Many of the television problems will have to be considered against thetechnical background. The Television Advisory Committee are considering whether the existing (405-line) standards of definition will be good enough for thefuture development of television and on the introduction of colour. The Chairmanof this Committee has told me that he will probably report in this coming April.Any decision to introduce an improved standard of definition would, in general,reduce the number of programmes that could be provided from the availablefrequencies. It would be for the Independent Committee to assess the social andeconomic consequences of a change against the technical advantages. But therewould be tactical advantages in the setting up of the Independent Committee beforethe Television Advisory Committee&apos;s Report is published (we are committed toplacing a copy in the Library of the House) so that it could be referred straight awayto the Independent Committee. If we publish the technical report in advance of setting up the Independent Committee then we shall come under pressure to makedecisions ourselves and without independent advice. In view of the many highly controversial problems to be examined, the many conflicting interests involved and the fact that responsible opinion expects an objective review of the whole field,I regard the case for an Independent Committee as overwhelming.4.  The terms of reference suggested by my predecessor in 1958 were:&quot; To review the broadcasting services in the United Kingdom, includingthe dissemination by wire of broadcasting and other programmes and to make recommendations: to advise on the future of the services to be provided bothby the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) and the independent television Authority (I.T.A.), and on the financial and other conditions underwhich these two organisations should conduct their services.&quot;5. These terms of reference were so drafted to make it plain that both theB.B.C. and I.T.A. would remain in being after 1964. In December last, however,the Home Affairs Committee thought these terms of reference might preclude the Independent Committee from considering the possibility of an additionalbroadcasting organisation or organisations.   With this I agree.   I also think it56725
necessary to make it clear that we are not excluding consideration of televisionfor public showing. I therefore suggest revised terms of reference as follows:&quot; To review broadcasting in the United Kingdom and the disseminationby wire of broadcasting and other &quot;programmes, and television for publicshowing: to advise, as regards future services in the United Kingdom, on those to be provided by the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. and on any other services,Qr, and on the financial and other conditions under which the services shouldbe conducted; and to make recommendations.&quot;I am assuming that there is no need for the Independent Committee to review the external Services of the B.B.C.6.   I suggest that the Committee might comprise:Chairman;two Members of Parliament: one Conservative, one Labour; and seven or eight other Members.The composite membership should be balanced to take account of experience in the field of education; trade unionism; commerce and industry; entertainment;and broadcasting; and to have regard to the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irishinterests. I think it important there should be at least one member with considerable technical knowledge to keep the Committee on the rails.7. I give the suggested timetable in Annex B. Some doubt was expressedin the Home Affairs Committee as to whether it was necessary to appoint theIndependent Committee as early as the spring. But if the estimated time for theCommittee&apos;s deliberations proves too optimistic and I think it might the timetable will be tight. The Broadcasting Committee under the Chairmanship ofLord Beveridge took 18 months with only the B.B.C. to consider. The laboursof the new Committee cover a much wider field: moreover, the technicalbackground against which it will have to work is very difficult. To defer a decisionmay well land us into difficulties later on.8.   I seek the agreement of my colleagues to:(a) extension of the B.B.C.&apos;s Charter and Licence to 29th July, 1964;(b) the setting up of an Independent Committee to survey the broadcastingfield and analogous services, with the revised terms of reference as setout in paragraph 5; and(c) an early announcement.J. R. B.Post Office, E.C. 1,15th March, 1960.ANNEX A .Problems on which an Independent Committee on Broadcasting would advise the. future functioning of the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. (including the possibilityof technical co-ordination). There are difficult financial problems associated with both. organisations:(a) the continued financing of the growing needs of the B.B.C. by licence revenue;(b) the criticism by the Public Accounts Committee (P.A.C.) of the I.T.A.&apos;smethod of appointing programme contractors (this is entirely theresponsibility of the IT.A. under the Television Act) and the rejectionby the IT.A. of the P.A.C.&apos;s recommendation.The amount, of advertising, advertising practices, and the I.T.A.&apos;s relations withits programme contractors have all been under attack, as well as the profits beingmade in Independent Television.
Additional Television Programmes2. There are applications from the B.B.C. and I.T.A. for additionalprogrammes, from Welsh and Scottish bodies for separate Welsh and Scottishprogrammes, and from various interests for subscription (pay-as-you-view)television (including requests for experiments). The Board of Trade have urgedthat the Independent Committee should be called upon to pronounce, in advanceof their final report, on the possibility of an early subscription television experiment.3. Whether television viewing hours should continue to be controlled, whetherthey should be extended, and if so, by how much. (The I.T.A. desire an immediate increase of 21 hours per week.)The B.B.C. Sound Monopoly4.   There is renewed pressure for the introduction of commercial sound radio.Development of Television for Public Showing5. No final conclusions were stated in the 1952 White Paper on Broadcasting(Cmd. 8550, paragraphs 29-31). Applications are now being received for particularshowings to be authorised on an ad hoc basis.Services Provided by Wire6. The relay industry is always pressing to be allowed to originate programmes for dissemination over its networks, e.g., playing of gramophone records,subscription television, &amp;c. Such developments would be analogous to provisionof additional broadcasting programmes.7. There are many other problems such as political broadcasting, thetelevising of Royal and State occasions, and so on.March I960.ANNEX BTimetable(a) Time taken by Committee to complete its task andreport ... -     ...      ...      ......      ......(This may err on the side of optimism.
