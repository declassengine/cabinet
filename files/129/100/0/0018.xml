e3CONFIDENTIALthis document is the property of her britannic majesty^ government memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will have seen from the paper circulated by the Minister ofTransport that the Channel Tunnel project is technically possible, should befinancially viable, presents no significant legal problems, is acceptable from thegeneral economic viewpoint and, militarily, has advantages which slightly outweighits disadvantages. Furthermore, it should require no financial participation bythe Government since it is recommended that it should be built as a private venture.2. From the point of view of foreign relations there is a great deal to be said for supporting the project. For over a century the Channel Tunnel has been inpeople&apos;s minds. But attempts to build it have failed, in the main, for lack of support from this country. Now the Channel Tunnel could be made a symbol ofHer Majesty&apos;s Governments desire to draw closer to Europe and of our realisationthat the days of &quot; splendid isolation &quot; are no more. Indeed British support for it,if announced in the right fashion, as part of a general policy of co-operation and against the background of our attitude towards European questions during thepast few months, could have an important psychological impact on opinion inEurope.3. The French Government are known to be in favour. There will be strong support in France and on the Continent generally. A negative or even neutralattitude on the part of Her Majesty&apos;s Government would invite the accusation thatthey are incapable of moving with the times.4. If the Government approve the project, it will be important that theyshould co-ordinate their attitude and their action very closely with those of theFrench Government. The project will offer a field for close Anglo-french -operation on a basis of equality and I hope-we will make the most of it.5. Accordingly, although I have a slight prejudice for emotional reasonsagainst the project I feel it my duty to invite my colleagues on the grounds of public policy:  (a) to agree with the recommendations of the Minister of Transport;(b) to authorise me, in consultation with the Minister of Transport, to consultat the right time with the French Government about the further actionto be taken;(c) to agree that the public announcement of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfssupport should be timed in order to derive the maximum political advantage.Printed for the Cabinet.
