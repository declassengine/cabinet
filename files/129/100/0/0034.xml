this document is the property of her britannic majesty *s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1960C. (60) 3424th February, 1960CABINETFUTURE STATUS OF THE POST office memorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe Cabinet decided in July 1959 that the approved plan for changes in thestatus of the Post Office should be written into the Election Manifesto, and thatthis should be followed by the issue of a White Paper after the Election (C.C. (59)42nd Conclusions, Minute 6).2. A draft White Paper, prepared in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, was approved by the Home Affairs Committee in December 1959,subject to the settlement of two outstanding points of policy, concerned respectivelywith the revenue objectives of the Post Office and services rendered to other government Departments. These have now been settled in consultation with theFinancial Secretary and the Minister of Pensions, and incorporated in the attached draft.3. When these proposals were before my colleagues prior to the Election my predecessor suggested a uniform procedure for fixing all Post Office tariffs by orunder Regulations subject to negative resolution. It was feared, however, thatthis might be taken as a precedent for closer Parliamentary control over changes made by other nationalised bodies. This question has been re-examined by theHome Affairs Committee who share my view that it should be included in theWhite Paper. After all, we are proposing to ask Parliament to recognise thatPost Office expenditure is limited by Post Office income, and to surrender the traditional voting of money for Post Office purposes. By giving Parliament aright to object to tariff changes we should be affording it some overall control which, I believe, it would like to have. The provision has been included inparagraph 26 (/) of the draft.4. The draft has been so worded as to avoid bringing in the nationalised industries, or saying anything which might either anticipate or be incompatible with any future decisions.I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that a White Taper in the formof the attached draft should be published forthwith.J.

The Status of the Post OfficeSUMMARYThe proposals in this White Paper are designed to givepractical recognition to the commercial character of thePost Office. They maintain direct control of the PostOffice by the Postmaster General who will remain responsible to Parliament.These proposals would complete the steps taken bythe Government in 1955.The main features of this Paper are 1. The separation of Post Office finances from theExchequer.2. The abolition of the annual Parliamentary Estimateprocedure and the Treasury control that goes with it.3. Its   replacement  by   effective-but   neverthelessflexible Parliamentary control.4. Post Office staff will remain civil servants.
I.   INTRODUCTIONAn immense trading organisation. The Post Office is an immense national trading organisation. Thepublic spend more than  400 million annually on its postal, telephone and telegraph services. But more than twelve times that amount passes over itscounters: indeed, the other facilities it offers for the remittance of money,for savings, the payment of pensions, and a host of public transactions -involve the handling of more than  5,000 million year by year.Traditional controls are not appropriate2. At present all Post Office revenues are paid into the Exchequer andmonies needed to meet Post Office costs are issued from the Exchequer.It is in direct consequence that the trading activities of the Post Office arestill subject to the traditional controls which, in other Departments, aim toregulate the spending of public money raised by taxation. Yet, unlike those departments, the Post Office lives on what its customers spend on its services.That it should do so is the objective of Post Office financial policy.Proposed Status3. It is now proposed to give the Post Office greater commercial freedomwhile remaining under the direct control of the Postmaster General. its current finances will be severed from the Exchequer and, subject to thePostmaster General&apos;s responsibilities as a Member of the Government andto Parliament, he will be master of his own house in law and in fact.4. The Post Office has many social obligations. But the existence of these obligations does not mean that the Post Office should be run primarily as avast social service without regard to the economic facts of life. Indeed, inmost essential respects it is, and ought to be recognised as and function as a commercial organisation. If, after allowing for its social responsibilities, itfails to approach the problems of management and organisation with a business mind it will quickly become inefficient. The Post Office must be free to make quick decisions: it must be free to use the criteria applied in theworld of commerce for gauging efficiency: it must be free to innovate and develop as a business seeking to meet and anticipate its customers&apos; demands.5. Freedom is a great spur and these proposals, once implemented, will prove it to be so.
II. THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION NOWChanges in 19556. The special case of the Post Office as a commercial organisation was first recognised by the Bridgeman Report of 1932. The arrangements thenintroduced were suspended during the war. But in 1955 the Government againagreed that the Post Office should be responsible for balancing its income andexpenditure and it was encouraged to conduct its business as a commercialenterprise. These principles, and the arrangements to make them effective,were embodied in the &quot;Report on Post Office Development and Finance &quot;(Cmd. .9576), presented in October, 1955. Commercial Accounts were to govern Post Office financial policy. The Post Office was to contribute a fixedsum of  5 million a year to the Exchequer.What remained unchanged7. This change, however, introduced no radical alteration in parliamentary and accounting procedures to accord with the concept of the Post Office asa trading concern. For all revenue is still paid to the Exchequer and all expenditure has to be voted by Parliament in annual Estimates. And theTreasury retains its power of control over it.8. Cash accounts still have to be presented, even though they differ widelyfrom the Commercial Accounts and they do not reflect the true financialposition of the Post Office. These requirements arise because (i) since 1787 all Government receipts from taxation or other sourceshave had to be paid into the Consolidated Fund;(ii) no Government expenditure for any purpose can be incurred withoutthe specific authority of Parliament.III.   WHAT THE GOVERNMENT NOW INTENDSPost Office to remain a Government Department9. In the Governmenfs view, the steps taken in 1955 have proved valuable.They should now be taken to their logical conclusion.10. It has been suggested more than once that the Post Office or at least the telephone service-should become a public corporation. But thecommunity expects its mails to be carried by State employees under the direct control of the Government. And there are strong practical reasons for keeping the telecommunications services together with the mails in a singleorganisation. Therefore, both should remain as parts of a GovernmentDepartment.11. Moreover, the Bridgeman Report of 1932 argued that &quot;the public have a right to the influence which Parliamentary discussion and controlalone can give&quot;. The Government agree that there is real advantage in having the Post Office directly represented by a Minister in Parliament. Withthat reservation-which is important-they have concluded that thecommercial character of the Post Office should now be recognised byParliament in statutory terms.
Staffed by Civil Servants * ;   ,12. Post Office staff will therefore retain, in full, their status as CivilServants.Separation of finances from the Exchequer13. At the heart of the Governments proposals is the establishment of a statutory Trading Fund for the Post Office. This Fund would be quite separate from the Exchequer. The Treasury would have no responsibility for it. Itwould be managed by the Postmaster General. All Post Office receipts wouldbe paid into it. All Post Office payments would be met out of it. The presentprovision for Post Office self-balancing revenue and expenditure would disappear from the Budget.IV.   THE  ACCOUNTING   CHANGESAppropriation Accounts14. As indicated in paragraph 7 the Post Office, in common with otherDepartments, now has to prepare estimates for its annual cash requirements.These cover salaries and wages, purchase of materials, contract payments, andso on. There is a consequential obligation to ensure that money is spentaccording to the sums voted by Parliament, after approval of the Estimate.The final results have to be shown in an Appropriation Account.15. This type of accounting is quite out of place for a commercialorganisation. It gives no indication of the profitability or otherwise of theservices financed by the expenditure. Neither does it show the assets and liabilities of the business. In brief, it does not help either as an instrument ofcontrol for management, or as a source of information for Parliament and thepublic.Commercial Accounts16. The decisions taken by the Government in October, 1955, gave thePost Office greater responsibility for pursuing sound financial policies. Theydirected attention to the Commercial Accounts.17. These accounts, which show the overall trading position for the yearand the profit or loss on the various services, are similar to those which a company would submit to its shareholders. Unlike the cash accounts, which show actual cash received and cash paid out in the year, the CommercialAccounts show income earned and expenditure incurred. For example, the cash accounts show the actual pension payments to former staff, while theCommercial Accounts are debited with the appropriate contributions towardsthe pension rights of the staff actually employed. The Commercial Accountsalso include interest on capital, provision for the- replacement of physicalassets and the annual contribution to the Exchequer. There is also a balance sheet, compiled in accordance with commercial practice.
18. The Commercial Accounts are used to determine Post Office financial policy, including the fixing of charges.The future19. With the new proposals the year&apos;s financial results would be given inthe Commercial Accounts alone. The confusion caused by the present systemof dual accounting cash accounts for one purpose: commercial accounts for another would disappear. A report from the Postmaster General wouldaccompany them. This is in line with modern commercial practice. greater emphasis would be laid on commercial accounting as an instrument offinancial control within the Post Office.V.   FINANCIAL  POLICYRevenue objectives20. The Post Office would be required by statute to secure that its revenuesshould not be less than sufficient, taking one year with another, to meet itsoutgoings properly chargeable to revenue account. In practice a standard of performance appropriate to a sound commercial organisation in the public sector would be expected. For example the policies of providing for depreciation by reference to the current value of the assets and of making fullprovision for accumulating pension liabilities would continue. The PostOffice would also aim to provide appropriate reserves.Contribution to the Exchequer21. The traditional exemption of the Post Office from most forms oftaxation would continue. It would, however, be required to make an annual contribution to the Exchequer approximately equivalent in amount to the taxes it would have had to pay but for this exemption.Capita] Expenditure22. Post Office borrowings of new capital would continue to be authorised by Acts of Parliament. At present the Post Office itself finances through theprovision it makes for depreciation rather more than half its annual needs for the renewal, modernisation and expansion of its system.Obligations to the Community23. Emphasis on the commercial aspects of Post Office business must notbe allowed to subtract from its obligations to the community as a whole,though this may mean giving some services below cost. For example, the dailydelivery of letters to scattered communities, and in some cases the provisionof telephone service for them, is very expensive. Moreover, losses on inlandtelegrams are universal.
VII.   TREASURY  CONTROL27. The 1955 changes, like those which flowed from the Report of theBridgeman Committee in 1932, were calculated &quot; to facilitate a less meticulousTreasury control of the Post Office &quot;. The spirit of these intentions has had agreat deal of influence on relationships between the two Departments in recentyears. Treasury responsibilities have remained, however, because of theconstitutional requirement that all revenue must be paid into the Exchequer,from which money can only be issued under Treasury control.VI.  PARLIAMENTARY  CONTROLNormal Estimates procedure to cease24. There would be no annual authorisation of Post Office expenditure byParliament through Estimates, except for Ministers&apos; salaries.Ample control remains25. But Parliament would still have plenty of opportunities for examiningPost Office affairs and for satisfying itself about Post Office policy and management in general. Indeed, the information to be put before parliament should give it a much clearer picture of what is happening than it gets now.26. The intention is to provide that the Postmaster General&apos;s power todraw on the Post Office Fund should lapse annually unless it is renewed by affirmative resolution of the House of Commons. Moreover, each year (a) Parliament would authorise by Vote the salaries of Post OfficeMinisters in accordance with the normal procedure;(b) the Postmaster General would be under a statutory obligation topresent a Report and Commercial Accounts (in greater detail than atpresent);(c) the Postmaster General would also give Parliament statements on-(i) the prospects for the ensuing year;(ii) the investment programme and the plans for financing it;(iii) the staff employed;id) the Commercial Accounts would continue to be subject to audit by the comptroller and Auditor General and to scrutiny by the public accounts Committee.In addition (e) the borrowing of new capital would have to be authorised by legislation;(/) it is intended to provide that, in future, all Post Office tariffs shall befixed by or under Regulations subject to negative resolution (at presentsome are subject to Parliamentary control and some are not);(g) Post Office Ministers would continue to answer Questions in parliament in just the same way as they do now.
28. Treasury responsibility for the Post Office would cease except in so faras its activities affect the national economy generally, or where Post office staff as part of the whole Civil Service are concerned. In practice this wouldmean that Treasury control over the Post Office would be restricted to threethings (a) pay, grading and conditions of service of staff;(b) investment control, including control of borrowing for the purpose of financing it (as for the public sector generally);(c) foreign exchange control.VIII.   RELATIONS WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS29. All services to and from other Government Departments would be paid for in cash. Where the services are of a kind offered to the public (for example,the provision of telephones) public charges would apply. For other services to Government (for example, the payment of family allowances), the PostOffice would be entitled to recover costs. -30. The Post Office would continue, on behalf of the Treasury, to managethe Post Office Savings Bank, National Savings Certificates and Stamps,Defence Bonds, Premium Savings Bonds and Post Office Register Stocks andBonds. Its expenses would be reimbursed as set out above.31. Any expenses incurred by the Post Office in connexion with Broad-casting would be reimbursed out of the Broadcasting Vote. Broadcastreceiving licence revenue would continue to be paid into the Exchequer.IX.   LEGISLATION32. Legislation to give effect to the proposals will take some time toprepare because of the complexities of the existing arrangements. But theGovernment hope to seek the approval of Parliament for these changes in thenext Parliamentary Session.x.  conclusion33. These proposals are designed to give the Post Office a statusappropriate to its commercial nature. That is right. To achieve this someinnovations are necessary but the innovations are right. The Governmentare confident that, as a result, the public will benefit, partly by a clearerunderstanding of the basis of Post Office operations, but more practicallyfrom the incentive which the Post Office will have to adapt itself to thedemands of the public and to evince an even greater sense of enterprise.Printed and published in Great Britain by her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office56349  Wt. 1328/16332  K     2/60  F.O.F.?- - secret
