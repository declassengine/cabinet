CONFIDENTIAL.this document is the property of her britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.  February I960C. (60) 19; Copy No. 485th February, I960CABINETECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH THE IRISH REPUBLICNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Government of the Irish Republic put to us last summer proposals whichwould involve the extension to agricultural producers in the Republic of certain of the benefits of the United Kingdom agricultural support system in return forwhich they offered concessions in the tariff field. I attach a memorandum by officials commenting on these proposals.2. I have already discussed the proposals with the Ministers concerned andwe have agreed that they are unacceptable. We ought, however, to try to putforward proposals of a more modest kind. The Government of Northern Irelandwere accordingly consulted on a proposition that we should offer the Irish republic the abolition of the differential on attested store cattle and sheep (described indetail in paragraph 7 of the attached memorandum) in return for particularconcessions in the trade field (described in paragraphs 8-10 of the memorandum).The Government of Northern Ireland see strong objections to these proposals onthe grounds that the abolition of the present differentials on store cattle and sheepwould adversely affect Northern Ireland producers. The grounds they advanceappear to be overdrawn.3. We are committed to receive Ministers from the Irish Republic in london on 12th February and, notwithstanding the views of Northern Ireland Ministers, i recommend that we offer to them an arrangement of the sort described inparagraphs 7-10 of the attached memorandum. I also recommend that afterCabinet Lord Brookeborough should be informed of Cabinefs conclusions and given an opening to ask for discussions in London before 12th February.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. I,5th February, I960.

ANNEXECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH THE IRISH REPUBLICAt a formal meeting in London on 13th July, 1959, between United kingdom ministers and those from the Irish Republic the Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, proposedan important step towards the integration of the economies of the United Kingdomand the Irish Republic. His Government subsequently sent us a memorandum which was discussed between officials of the two countries on 10th September, 1959.The proposals amount to a request for an extension to producers in the republic of the benefits given to United Kingdom producers under our agricultural supportsystem in respect of store cattle, sheep, fat animals and carcass meat and some part of the benefits given in respect of eggs, milk products, pigs and potatoes. Inreturn they offered tariff advantages for United Kingdom exports to the Republic,including new or increased preferences.Considerations which Prompted the Irish Republic to put Forward their proposals. Most of the Republic^ exports are of agricultural products and they are dependent on the United Kingdom market for 90 per cent, of their agricultural and70 per cent, of their industrial exports. Although almost all these exports are allowed into the United Kingdom free of duty or quota restrictions, the Governmentof the Republic maintain that the benefits of our Trade Agreement of 1938 havebeen seriously eroded by the expansion of United Kingdom agriculture, and thatthe value of their specific preferences in the United Kingdom market is much reduced by the fall in the value of money. They also fear that the Republic maysuffer a serious loss of trade following the reduction in our duties on industrialgoods and bacon as against our partners in the European Free Trade Association(E.F.T.A.). The Common Market and the formation of E.F.T.A. are making them feel isolated from the rest of Western,Europe. Mr. Lemass is anxious topromote closer co-operation, particularly with the United Kingdom, partly for itsown sake and partly in the hope of creating a more friendly climate of opinion between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Major Difficulties in the Proposals3.   The objections to Mr. Lemass&apos; proposals can be summarised as follows:  -(a) A proposal to introduce new direct subsidies to farmers outside the UnitedKingdom would be very hard to justify to the United Kingdom taxpayer.,. (b) Quite a,small increase in the volume of Southern Irish produce coming on,to our market could have a disproportionately depressing effect onmarket prices generally. In so far as our producers are protected byguaranteed prices a drop in their return from the market would be made good by the Exchequer. If this in fact happened our taxpayers would,in order to support Southern Irish farmers, have to pay large additionalsums to United Kingdom farmers, which our farmers would fear might provoke public criticism of the subsidy system.(c) It would be difficult to justify to Commonwealth countries, and inparticular to New Zealand and Australia, the extension of greater,benefits to the Republic than to those Commonwealth countries.id) Countries in Europe with which we may be in, or with which we may be,negotiating, a free trade area relationship might press us for similar,benefits.(e) In view of the United Kingdom&apos;s general commercial policy multilateraltrading and the removal of discrimination there might also be difficulties in our accepting benefits from the Irish Republic in so far asthey took the form of obliging the Republic to put increased duties onforeign foods.
Reasons Why the United Kingdom Should Give a Sympathetic Response to theIrish Republic. 4. There are, however, substantial arguments in favour of giving a constructive response to Mr. Lemass&apos; approach. The economic prospects of theIrish Republic are not good. The efforts made to diversify the Republics economyby the development of secondary industry have had only limited success. TheRepublic depend, and are likely to depend for as far ahead as can be seen, onselling their agricultural goods to the United Kingdom, but, unless they can greatly increase the efficiency of their agriculture, their prospects of expanding theirmarket here are poor and it is impossible to be optimistic about the future of theireconomy. The Republic are likely to be hit as the E.F.T.A. tariff reductions comeinto effect though we think the Dublin Government exaggerate their vulnerability.Our economic and social relations with the Republic are probably closer than with any other country, foreign or Commonwealth. Our trade with the Republicis roughly in balance at about  100 millions a year each way. It comes eighth inthe list of our world markets and a depression there must to some extent affect our own prosperity.5. Nor ought we to neglect this opportunity of seeking to ease some of thedifficulties which have arisen for us in our trade with the Republic. They have developed over the years since the 1938 Trade Agreement was concluded aconsiderable range of industrial exports to our market, taking advantage of theduty-free entry which was primarily intended to help their agricultural exports,and fostering this industry behind a tariff barrier which, notwithstanding the preferential rate which they afford to us, causes us considerable embarrassment.The contrast in treatment duty-free entry on one side and, in many cases, ahigh protective rate on the other is a source of constant irritation to UnitedKingdom manufacturers. The effect of this falls particularly heavily on someNorthern Ireland industries and the Government of Northern Ireland have made representations to us in the matter on several occasions. A particular difficultyarises from the use of Japanese components in goods manufactured in the Republicentering the United Kingdom free of restriction.6. There are political as well as economic arguments for going such distanceas we can in reply to Mr. Lemass. With the ending of Mr. De Valera&apos;s lengthydominance of the Irish political scene and the emergence of Mr. Lemass, himselfa business man, at the head of a more business-like administration, the politicalatmosphere in the South is changing. This metamorphosis will be neither rapidnor dramatic. But already there have been signs that the Dublin Governmentare anxious to move away from the negative attitudes of earlier administrationsand to improve gradually relations with the North. If the economy of the Republicwere to stagnate and we did nothing to help, its inhabitants might attribute to ourindifference their inability to share in the economic progress of the world. Moreimmediately unemployment and discontent may encourage support for and recruitment to terrorist organisations. If Mr. Lemass, who has publicly committedhimself deeply to seeking an improvement in his country&apos;s prospects by negotiation with the United Kingdom, receives from us a completely negative response, his policy of greater flexibility towards the United Kingdom is unlikely to prosper.Alternative proposals. In view of the difficulty of extending to the Republic in any general waythe benefits of our agricultural support system an exhaustive examination has beenmade of the alternative possibilities. Only one seems practicable, namely, an offer to remove the small differential which at present exists between the guaranteed price paid for cattle and sheep bred in the United Kingdom and that paid foranimals bought for finishing in the United Kingdom, the concession in the caseof cattle being confined to attested animals (i.e., animals which are free of bovinetuberculosis). The fattening of store cattle from the Republic for slaughter is animportant aspect of farming in many parts of Great Britain and Northern Irelandand in the peak year 1957 such store cattle represented about a quarter of our home produced beef. But our farmers are increasingly reluctant to buy stores from theSouth which are not fully attested. At present our guaranteed prices apply to storecattle from the South provided they have been in the United Kingdom for threemonths, the guaranteed price being 3s. 6d. a cwt. less than that for similar home
bred stock. The subsidy is paid to the United Kingdom farmer, who is thus enabled to pay a higher price for the stores than if he received no subsidy. In this waythe producer in the Republic gets an indirect benefit at the expense of the Exchequer.It is this differential of 3s. 6d. a cwt. which might be abolished on fully attestedstores only. This would be a means of helping to ensure an increased productionof attested stores which are essential to the United Kingdom livestock industryand might provide a basis for a trade deal with the Republic. The direct cost(without allowing for any fall in price which might result from extra supplies) of abolishing the differential on attested stores only might be of the order of  150,000in 1960-61, rising eventually to    million as the proportion of Irish store cattlewhich are attested increases, but would be less in so far as the average market prices exceed the guaranteed prices. There is a differential subsidy for importedsheep as well as cattle but the number of imported sheep is very small and thecost of abolishing the differential would be less than  100,000.8. In return we might ask for concessions designed to correct some of thedifficulties caused to us in the working of the existing Trade Agreement. The first charge on any credit which a concession from us will raise must be compensationfor the waiver of the preferences as against our E.F.T.A. partners on canned creamand blue veined cheese which we need for the purpose of our association withE.F.T.A. These preferences are guaranteed to the Republic in the Trade agreement and they have agreed to waive them subject to their waiver being taken into account in our current trade discussions with them.9.   In addition, we should seek the following concessions:  (a) A review by the Republic of their protective arrangements in general, witha view to implementing the intention behind one of the Articles in theTrade Agreement of 1938 under which the Dublin government undertook to restrict their duties to such a level as will give the UnitedKingdom full opportunity of reasonable competition.(b) A reduction (in advance of this review) of a few protective duties in theRepublic which cause us special difficulty, e.g., those on clothing andglass bottles.(c) Some arrangement which, without making a breach in the principle of commonwealth treatment for Republican; goods . or requiringamendment of the Trade Agreement, would help us to deal with casesof difficulty both on the export and import side. The kind of formula which we have in mind would be:  &quot; In the operation of the Trade Agreement difficulties arise for1the United Kingdom Government from the fact that (i) Some goods from the Irish Republic enter the UnitedKingdom either duty-free or at low preferential rates of duty while access for similar United Kingdom goods tothe Republic is restricted by protective duties or quotas.(ii) Some goods from the Irish Republic enter or may enter the United Kingdom free of restriction even though theyincorporate foreign components, on which the UnitedKingdom imposes restrictions.The Government of the Irish Republic agree that they will beready, in the event of special difficulties arising from thesecircumstances, to discuss with the United Kingdom Governmentpractical remedies even if these are not consistent with the1provisions of the Trade Agreement.&quot;Since, the-Northern Ireland Government, have said that they would reject any arrangement which, would give advantages to Northern Ireland manufacturers that were not equally available to manufacturers in Great Britain, we should not seekany concession designed to alleviate the particular difficulties Of Northern Ireland.110. It is unlikely that we shall be able to obtain all these concessions in return,for what we can offer, and allowing for the compensation which the RepublicanGovernment will expect for releasing us from our undertakings on canned creamand blue veined cheese.&apos; To what extent we need to modify or abandon them must,depend on the course of the negotiations.,      .&apos; .&apos;,
11. It will be necessary to draw the attention of Mr. Lemass and his colleagues to the fact that it would be difficult for us to abolish the differential in the guaranteed price for store cattle and sheep from the South except as part of ourAnnual Farm Price Review for the year 1960-61. If therefore they agree inprinciple that an agreement could be negotiated on the basis proposed above, we need to inform the Farmers Unions- in our forthcoming negotiations with themand we would hope that our negotiations with the Republic could be completed in time to enable the concession on store cattle and sheep to come into effect ohor shortly after 1st April, 1960. As we do not normally make alterations in the guarantees between one Review and the next it would be embarrassing to us tointroduce the concessions much later than 1st April. But we ought to avoid giving Ministers of the Republic the appearance of rushing them, as we have takenmany months to consider their proposals.Views of the Northern Ireland Government12. Northern Ireland Ministers, who have been consulted about thearrangements outlined above, raise the strongest objection to the grant, of the fullUnited Kingdom support price for fully-attested store cattle and for store sheepimported from the Irish Republic. The effects of such an arrangement would intheir view fall with disproportionate severity on Northern Ireland producers. they say they could not defend a policy of giving financial benefits to the Irish Republic,which they consider would be to the financial detriment of the agricultural industryin Northern Ireland, against the public and political criticism which such a policy would inevitably arouse; and they therefore urge the United Kingdom Governmentthat, if it is considered that some concession must be given to the Republic, thepossibility should be examined of doing it in some other way. A copy of their letter is at Appendix A and at Appendix B will be found some comments thereon by the Agricultural Departments in Great Britain. It will be seen that theapprehensions which Northern Ireland Ministers have as to the effect on NorthernIreland producers of a removal of the differential appear, in the view of theAgricultural Departments in Great Britain, to be greatly exaggerated. nevertheless it is clear that Northern Ireland Ministers feel very strongly on the subject and full account needs to be taken of this fact.Possibility of the Republic joining E.F.T.A.13. If the Republic were ready to join the European Free Trade Associationthis would involve the gradual dismantling of tariffs between them and the UnitedKingdom and would completely solve the trade difficulties of which ourmanufacturers complain. The Republic have, however, so far shown no desire tojoin E.F.T.A. Membership of the Association would eventually deprive the manufacturing industry in the Republic of protection against competition from theUnited Kingdom, which is their main supplier of industrial goods, to the same extent as would membership of a wider Free Trade Area in Europe, which theywere prepared in 1958 to join on general political grounds; but the long-term economic opportunities which they would gain in E.F.T.A. would be much lessthan they believe they would have in a wider Free Trade Area. The Republic may,however, be more disposed on political grounds to consider joining E.F.T.A. once they appreciate that we cannot accept their proposal for an integration of theireconomy with that of the United Kingdom and it would be premature to urge thiscourse on them at this stage. But if they raise the matter we would tell them thatthey could count on our being ready to use our good offices with our partners insupport of Irish membership or association.Meeting with Mr. Lemass on 12th February14. A further meeting with Mr. Lemass has been arranged for 12th February.It has been arranged that the President of the Board of Trade should lead for theUnited Kingdom with the assistance of the Minister of Agriculture, the economic secretary, Treasury and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations.February, 1960.
appendix ACOPY OF LETTER FROM NORTHERN IRELANDCABINET SECRETARYMinisters have considered the proposals in the Memorandum on economic relations between the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic which Was forwardedwith your letter of 19th January.They are firmly opposed to any arrangement which would have the effect of drawing a distinction between goods of Northern Ireland origin and those ofGreat Britain origin. They would accordingly have to reject any proposal which sought to give advantages to Northern Ireland manufacturers which were not alsoand equally available to manufacturers in Great Britain. This effectively disposesof the query raised in paragraph 20 of the Memorandum.In addition Ministers expressed the view that the formula [outlined inparagraph 9(c) of the Memorandum by officials] which seems to be aimed at sercuring some limitation in the volume of imports of certain items to the UnitedKingdom is likely to have little or no practical benefit for Northern Ireland in sofar as any restriction that might be entertained by the Republic on, e.g., furniturewould probably be related to current levels of trade.As regards the proposal to give the full United Kingdom support price forattested store cattle and for store sheep imported from the Irish Republic, I aminstructed to register the strongest objection against such an arrangement on thegrounds that its effects will fall with disproportionate severity on Northern Irelandproducers.In the case of cattle about one-third of the Southern store cattle imported intothe United Kingdom come to Northern Ireland for fattening. Accordinglyone-third of the cost of the concession will fall on Northern Ireland cattle finishers,and there can be no certainty that this will be fully recouped to Northern Irelandproducers in the price guarantees. The proposal is certain to evoke vigorousprotests from the Ulster Farmers&apos; Union.At the technical level there is some ground for doubting the bona fide natureof some of the attestation certificates furnished with cattle arriving from theRepublic and this gives cause for considerable alarm as to what is likely to happenshould a more attractive price become payable to the Irish Republic producer for imported stores.On sheep, it is stated that the number of imported sheep is very small, andthat the cost to the Exchequer would not, therefore, be great, but it seems to havebeen overlooked that practically all store sheep imported into the United kingdom from the Republic come to Northern Ireland. Increased imports resulting fromthe removal of the present differential are bound to have an adverse effect on the overall market price in Northern Ireland.Our producers would thereby suffer a loss in income which would certainly not be offset by a corresponding increase in the guarantee.Ministers are unable to understand the basis for this proposal at a time when there is already more than an adequate supply of sheep in the United Kingdomand when consideration is now being given to a reduction in the guarantee forsheep to discourage the further increase in production in the United Kingdom.In these circumstances the proposed concession to the Republic in the case ofsheep appears to Ministers to be economically indefensible.By way of general comment on the proposals Ministers feel that while adefinite concession with an immediate and visible value is being offered on theUnited Kingdom side that sought from the Republic in exchange does not committhat Government to any particular course of action beyond the requirement toenter into discussions with the United Kingdom Government.Such an arrangement, if it were to be agreed, could not fail to causeunfavourable comment in Northern Ireland.
I have also been instructed to say that, in so far as Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentin their anxiety to provide financial benefits to the Republic aim to do so with consequent financial disadvantages to the Northern Ireland agricultural industry,there will inevitably be public and political criticism of a policy which Ministers inNorthern Ireland will be quite unable to defend.They would therefore urge Her Majesty&apos;s Government that if they consider some concession must be given to the Irish Republic they should examine thepossibility of doing it in some other way.Appendix BCOMMENTS BY THE AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENTS IN GREATBRITAIN ON THE LETTER FROM THE NORTHERN IRELANDCABINET SECRETARY AT APPENDIX AThe Agricultural Departments in Great Britain agree that if the abolition ofthe abatement in guarantee payments on imported attested cattle and on importedsheep from the Irish Republic were adversely to affect United Kingdom producersit would do so particularly in Northern Ireland. It is also recognised that there might be particular presentational difficulties there and that Northern Irelandproducers might feel that they were adversely affected whatever.the actual effects.But it is not considered that the effects would be those feared by Northern ireland ministers.Attested Store Cattle2. The Northern Ireland fear appears to be that, if the differential were removed the home producer would not be out of pocket when guarantees are payable (he would pay extra for his store imports and be recouped from theguarantee payment after fattening the animals), he would be out of pocket by an extra payment on imported stores when no guarantee was payable on the finishedanimals.3. There is no regular and precise relationship between the prices of stores and fat animals but producers must, by and large, have regard to their expectedrealisation value when buying imported stores. The guaranteed price is normallythe indicator of this. When there are no guarantee payments, it is because the realisation from the market price is higher than the guaranteed price. If any such period was prolonged the market for stores would be strong and the prices paid for them would be the same whether or not there was an abatement in rates of guarantee.4. It is suggested that in circumstances when stores are bought in the expectation that guarantees will be paid on the fattened animals, and in the event the market price for fats proves to be higher than the guaranteed price, part of the extra profit at present made by the producer would be denied him if the abatementof the guarantees were abolished. However, the converse would be equally true,namely that a producer paying prices for stores at a time when no guarantees werepayable, and selling them later on when guaranteed payments were resumed, wouldbe better off under the proposed arrangements, the present abatement beingtantamount to a loss of profit.5. Northern Ireland also see objections to the proposal on animal healthgrounds. The Agricultural Departments in Great Britain feel satisfied that theofficial veterinary certificates issued by the Republic Authorities are reliable. Thereis, of course, some risk that forged certificates might be used but this would not be appreciably increased by the proposal. It is felt that the greatest risk in the animal health field in Northern Ireland comes from the possibility that infected animalswill be smuggled across the border from the Republic and mixed with the infection-free herds in Northern Ireland. But this is a risk which has to be faced in any case.
Sheep - o;b oi tii^^UdoqzVi mi o.* r^r^n &apos;;;-,r--.:\h &amp;:t0yi &amp; ;- &apos;:-6. Northern Ireland fear that the proposal would increase imports of storesheep into Northern Ireland thereby depressing their market prices for finishedsheep. As the same rate of guarantee is payable throughout the United Kingdomthis would be detrimental to Northern Ireland producers. It is also suggested thatsuch increased, imports would be indefensible at a time when it is desired to discourage any further increase in production in the United Kingdom.7. The Agricultural Departments in Great Britain feel that the abatementof Jd. per lb. in the guaranteed price is very small in relation to the very high ratesof guarantee which will be payable during the peak marketing season and that theabolition of this differential would therefore be unlikely to result in any significant increase in imports of sheep from the Republic.February, I960.
