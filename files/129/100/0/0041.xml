ELECTRICITY WAGE CLAIMMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer would draw the attention of my colleagues to the memorandum bythe Minister of Power (W.(60) 14) which sets out the current position on the wage claim in the electricity supply industry.    This memorandum has beenconsidered by the Wages Policy Committee.2.      In December, 1959,   the industry reached agreement on a reductionin normal weekly hours from 44 to 42, without loss of pay, with effect from 1st February, I960.    This settlement will probably cost the industry from 3 -  5 millions a year, or from 4 - 6j per cent on the wage bill, accordingto the number of hours of overtime regularly worked.    Following thesettlement on hours, the unions presented a claim for a &quot;substantial increase&quot; in hourly rates.3.       On 17th February the wage claim was rejected by the representativesof the Electricity Council who said, however, that they would be prepared,without commitment, to look at the matter again in some months&apos; time when a closer assessment of the cost of the recent settlement on hours would beavailable.    The Electricity Council made it clear that they would then consider some re-definition and re-grouping of occupations within theindustry.    The Council have in mind that, in the course of this review, thepossibility of some improvement in pay for a limited number of the mostskilled workers would be considered.4.     At an informal meeting with union representatives on 29th February,the Chairmen of the Electricity Council and of the Central electricity generating Board maintained this position.    The arguments which theyadvanced are set out in paragraph 8 of W.(60) 14.    The next formal meeting between the two sides will take place on 17th March.    Since there is apossibility of g.t least sporadic strike action if the Electricity Councilmaintain their present attitude, the Chairman has asked the Minister of power whether the Government would support him in the stand he is taking.5.     After considering this situation, the Wages Policy committee recommend that:-(a) In view of the unfortunate effect on other industries,particularly engineering, of conceding a general wage increase on top of the reduction in hours, the Ministerof Power should tell the Chairman of the electricity council that the Government support the line that thepresent wage claim should be resisted.-1-IIC. (60) 41 COPY NO.   ^4th March, I960CABINET
(b) The Minister should ask the Chairman to provide assoon as possible an assessment of the proportion of skilled workers concerned and of the wage increasesthat might result from a re-definition of occupations.(c) If (a) is approved by Ministers, the Chairman of theElectricity Council should be asked the extent of thestrike action he thinks likely to result from the rejection of the claim. *(d) Officials should be invited to prepare an appreciation of the emergency arrangements that might be necessaif strike action took place in the electricity supply industry in March or April.6.     I invite the Cabinet to endorse these recommendations.D0 H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.3rd March, I960.-2-
