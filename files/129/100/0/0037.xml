CONFIDENTIAL -M        121(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 37 COPY NO. jCV29th February, I960CABINETFARM PRICE REVIEW, 1960Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at its meeting on 9th February the Cabinet invited the agriculture ministers to propose to the Farmers&apos; Unions a reduction of  15 millions inthe total value of the agricultural guarantees (C. C.(60) 6th Conclusions,Minute 5).    The Farmers&apos; Unions have rejected this and have put forward proposals for an increase of  10 millions.    The Ministerial Committee onthe Farm Price Review have agreed that there should be some concession to the Farmers&apos; Unions but are not agreed either on the total figure or the alteration in the pig guarantee.2.        The Agriculture Ministers consider that the reduction in the total value of the guarantees should not exceed  9 millions.    Even at this figure a determination would have to be imposed.    A reduction of  9 millions isthe most which the Agriculture Ministers would feel able to defend inParliament and with the agricultural industry in view of the strength of theUnions&apos; arguments that incomes in the rest of the community are increasingand that farmers should be left with some share in the gains from theirincreasing efficiency.    With cost increases now assessed at  13 millions, areduction of  9 millions would leave the industry with only  3 millions of theestimated  25 millions gains from increasing efficiency.    As regards pigsthe Agriculture Ministers consider that there should be an increase of 3d. perscore in the guaranteed price in addition to the alteration in the guarantee arrangements (equivalent to an increase of about 6d. per score) previously envisaged by the Cabinet.    They point out that the Government are particularly vulnerable to criticism from pig producers;  our pig breedingherd has fallen while the Danish was last July at a record high level.    Duringthe last quarter of 1959 home production of bacon was 14 per cent below what it was a year before, while imports of Danish bacon were about27 per cent higher.    The Agriculture Ministers are satisfied that in thesecircumstances an increase of 3d. in the guaranteed price, in addition to the alteration in the guarantee arrangements, could readily be defended with the danes.3.        My view is that a reduction of  10 millions is as far as we should go to meet the Farmers&apos; Unions and that even this may not be whollyconsistent with our production objectives.    At the Cabinet meeting on 9th February it was generally agreed that in the course of the negotiationswe should not go below  13 millions or possibly  12 millions.    Since then there has been an increase in costs of nearly  2 millions as a result of theScottish agricultural wages settlement;   a reduction of  10 millions would therefore be consistent with this earlier view.    As regards pigs, my fearis that the proposal to increase the guaranteed price in addition to altering
&apos;     1LLthe guarantee arrangements could not be reconciled with the spirit of our agreement with the Danes and might jeopardise their ratification of theEuropean Free Trade Association Convention.    In addition there are nowsigns that our pig breeding herd is beginning to increase.    Conditionschange rapidly in this field-   and we do not want to provoke a new and expensive pig cycle.4. The Appendix shows Review determinations consistent with thesetwo differing views.    I invite my colleagues to decide: -(a) whether the reduction in the total value of the guaranteesshould be  9 millions or  10 millions;   and(b) whether there should be any increase in the guaranteed price for pigs in addition to the alterations in the guarantee arrangements.D.
