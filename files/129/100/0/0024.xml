Printed for the Cabinet.   February I960C. (60) 24 Copy No.    5812th February, I960CABINETDENATIONALISATION OF STEELMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer it is necessary to instruct the Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agencyas to the steps which they should take, now that the uncertainty created by theGeneral Election is over, to proceed with their unfinished work of returning theiron and steel industry to private ownership as is required under the Iron andSteel Act of 1953. This involves decisions as to whether the Agency is to be instructed to seek to dispose of the whole of the Governmenfs interest in theindustry; the order in which it is to dispose of the various types of holding; andthe speed with which it is to act. Interest Parliamentary, Press and industrial in the future activities of the Agency is mounting and it will I feel sure be necessaryfor us to declare our general attitude in the debate on the Steel Loans Bill on18th February.The Governmenfs Holdings2.   These fall into three parts: - (a) Richard Thomas and Baldwins Limited (R.T.B.).(b) The prior charges (debentures, loan stock and preference shares) still held in companies already denationalised.(c) The remaining 10 (small) companies other than R.T.B. which remain in public ownership.R.T.B.3. The value in the Agency&apos;s books is about  22 millions, of which  21 millionsconsists of equity capital. This understates its market value. The net valueof the assets in the company&apos;s books amounts to about  59 millions, the differencebeing accounted for mainly by the ploughing back of profits while the concern hasbeen in public ownership. At present about 10 per cent, of the total ingotproduction of steel is produced by the company. When the new strip mill projectat Newport is completed, together with the associated developments, R.T.B. willbe one of the biggest units in the industry with net assets of about  180 millions.These new developments, which are to be completed by 1964 but may, possibly, be accelerated, will cost in all about  110 millions towards which the Minister of power has undertaken to lend a maximum of  70 millions.Prior Charges4. Between 1953 and 1959 the Agency sold the equity in companies which represented (in terms of output) about five-sixths of the total companies taken over from the Iron and Steel Corporation. Over the same period, however, the Agencyreduced its investments and obligations in the industry only from  364 millions to 213 millions, a reduction of about 40 per cent. In particular it still holds priorcharge securities of which the nominal value is  158 millions though the current market value is substantially less mainly owing to the rise in interest rates over recent years.this document is the property of her britannic majesty^ government

The Remaining Ten Companies:i5.; Of these the largest is the Staveley Iron and Chemical Company, with abook value of  8 millions. The book value of the remainder is  17 millions. Theyare,&apos; in effect, what remains after the stronger concerns have been sold off and aretherefore not very attractive.Future policy &amp; 6. The Economic Policy Committee have considered the questions inparagraph 1 in the light of the advice of the Bank of England and the Agencythat it should be possible to dispose of the bulk of the Agency&apos;s holdings (equityand prior charges) inside, say, three years, without overburdening the market andwithout serious prejudice to the market&apos;s ability to meet the demands of the industry for development funds and the like.7.   The main points arising out of discussion in the Economic PolicyCommittee are as follows:GeneralThe main aim should be to give full effect to the philosophy of the 1953Act and return the remainder of the industry to private enterprise at as fasta rate as the Agency can prudently achieve, having regard to their statutory obligations to obtain a financially adequate return for the assets. It wouldbe desirable to clear the situation entirely within a period of about three years. if possible i.e., before the question of renationalisation can be revived.R.T.B.This company occupies a crucial position in the disposals problem.The Economic Policy Committee considered some arguments againstearly disposal and perhaps against disposal at all. In favour of delay it might&apos; be argued that in an early disposal it would be difficult to obtain an adequatereturn for the future growth prospects inherent in the present development schemes: and that early and complete financial disengagement by her majesty&apos;s Government was unlikely to be practicable in view of the size ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government^ present stake and commitment. In favour of prolonged and perhaps permanent retention of the company in public ownership it might be argued that the Government would thus have readily available an instrument for creating additional steel capacity when necessaryin the national interest, or at least of bringing more effective pressure on theprivate sector to make such provision.The Economic Policy Committee felt, however, that the considerationson the other side were quite decisive. Deliberate retention of the company in public ownership permanently or for a further prolonged period would be incompatible with the philosophy of the 1953 Act and would need legislation.Any delay in arriving at a decision in principle to sell R.T.B. would createserious difficulties. First, it would upset the legitimate expectations of theindustry, the City and the bulk of our own supporters: and it might wellprejudice the full co-operation of the industry and the City in the rest ofthe disposals programme. Secondly, the market for equities and, inparticular, steel equities is now good. Thirdly,, the problems of marketing maywell increase with the continuing growth in the size of R.T.B.: there is alreadytalk of a further development to cost about  40 millions which, if a sale isdelayed, may involve a further injection of public funds. Fourthly, theobtaining and retention of suitable directors may become difficult if the intended status of the company is left in doubt. Moreover, the Agency believethat, if a decision in principle to sell is taken soon, it should be possible tofloat off the company in the latter part of this year on the basis of a new capital structure which should prove attractive to investors and secure forHer Majesty&apos;s Government some benefit from future growth prospects.Prior charges the continued holding by the Agency of the large amount of prior charges in companies which have been sold to private enterprise gives some ground for the argument that the claim to have denationalised the industry is somewhat
specious. From this point of view the sooner the Agency can dispose of theseholdings the better, although the programme for sale should not be such asto interfere with the disposal of R.T.B. The Agency may well show a loss on the sale of these securities because in recent years interest rates have risenand the value of such securities has fallen. This result may give rise to political criticism, but answers to this will be less difficult to find than answers to attacks on the Governments continued holdings of fixed securities incompanies of which the equity has been returned to private enterprise.The Remaining Ten CompaniesNo special policy problems arise on the disposal of these.   Individualproposals for sale will be submitted to me by the Agency in the ordinary way.conclusions. In the light of the foregoing I invite the Cabinet to endorse the conclusionsof the Economic Policy Committee as follows :  (i) We should give an indication in the near future (probably in connexionwith the Steel Loans Bill) and in fairly general terms, of the intentionto continue the process of returning the industry, including R.T.B., to private ownership in accordance with the provisions of the 1953 Act.(ii) We should authorise the Agency to consult with City advisers on the best methods of carrying out this intention; and, in particular, to preparein such consultation a scheme for the disposal of R.T.B., including provision for securing to Her Majesty&apos;s Government some share in the expected growth of the value of the company.(iii) We should instruct the Agency to take advantage of any suitableopportunities for disposing of their holdings of prior charges and otherinvestments in so far as these operations would not prejudice the R.T.B.disposal and that they should otherwise work to a programme designedto return to private ownership the remainder of the industry andsecurities within a period of three years, at as fast a rate as they canprudently achieve, having regard to their statutory obligations.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,12th February, 1960.
