SECRET &quot; 10(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(60) 3 COPY NO.     nv S15th January, I960CABINETFURTHER REMOVAL OF IMPORT RESTRICTIONSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will recall that I circulated on 23rd October, 1959,proposals for liberalisation of imports (C. (59) 159).   On 4th November thePresident of the Board of Trade announced the removal of quantitative restrictions from a range of imports from countries other than the EasternArea and Japan.   In his statement the President said that the United Kingdomintended to make further progress with the relaxation of the outstandingrestrictions as soon as they could.   On 22nd December the Economic PolicyCommittee considered a note by the Chairman of the Economic steering committee covering a report by officials recommending the further removalof import restrictions on certain items.   The recommendations of theEconomic Policy Committee, which I now invite my colleagues to approve,are set out in the following paragraphs.2.     It would help to head off protectionist measures in the United StatesCongress which is now reassembling if the next step in the removal of restrictions were announced at the end of this month and this were followedby a further tranche in February or March.First List - January3.      It is proposed that the first list should consist of the following items:(i)     Tobacco and tobacco manufactures (other than cigars).The Economic Policy Committee&apos;s recommendation on this itemwas subject to the outcome of consultations between the United KingdomGovernment and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and on the outcoi*neof talks between the Rhodesian growers and United Kingdom manufacturers.The Federal Government, in signifying their agreement asked for a numberof assurances, of which the most important related to the level of preference .We have told them that while we cannot give an assurance that the preference1,will never be reduced we have recognised that it would not be right toask the Federation tobacco growers to face a reduction in preferenceimmediately after the removal of our import restriction on dollar tobacco,and that we will therefore not be ready to consider any request for areduction of the preference in the 1960-61 multilateral tariff negotiationsby the members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
( ii)   Fish, fresh, chilled or frozen.The Economic Policy Committee recognised that the removal of restrictions on this item would be unpopular with the United Kingdom fishing industry since it might appear to be a concession to Canada which was notshowing a sympathetic attitude to our proposals concerning the Law of theSea.   They therefore agreed that for presentational reasons it might bebetter to postpone the removal of restrictions on fish until the second list.Since then the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotlandhave decided that it would be easier for them presentationaily ifliberalisation could be got out of the way well before, instead of just before,the conference on the Law of the Sea opens in mid-March.   They therefore propose that fish should be included in the first listj  and I support this.(iii) Synthetic rubber, of which imports are already licensed freely,so that the removal of restrictions is unlikely to have a significant effecton the volume of imports.   It is desirable to take this step as soon aspossible while the price of natural rubber remains high, and the Malayanauthorities have accepted it.(iv) Transistors.(v) It is proposed that the Anglo-American Film Agreement should bebrought to an end at the same time as the first announcement.   I am satisfiedthat this will not increase the burden on the United Kingdom&apos;s balance ofpayments.   The United States film companies have, as a matter of policy,not been transmitting their profits from the United Kingdom to theUnited States to the extent permitted under the Agreement.Second List - late February or March4.      It is proposed that the second tranche- in late February or March -should consist of -(i)  fresh and processed milk(ii)  dyes and dyestuffs(iii)   canned fruit (other than grapefruit and apples).The exact date for the liberalisation of each of these commodities depends on a different set of circumstances and it is therefore impossible to givea precise timetable at this stage.Cost5.     I estimate that, as a result of freeing the items proposed for thesetwo lists, the net addition to the total import bill of the United Kingdom wouldbe roughly  5-6 millions a year.Canned fruit (other than grapefruit and apples)6.      H. M. Ambassador in Washington (Sir Harold Caccia) advises thatthere will be a severely critical reaction from California if canned fruitis relegated to the second tranche.   It has however been explained to him that this is a rather carefully balanced programme and that liberalisation of canned fruit will cause difficulty in South Africa and Australia.   Inreply Sir Harold Caccia has emphasised that if the inclusion of canned fruitin the first list is impossible careful presentation will be -r-eqiirred to     &apos;   &apos; &apos;-2-
minimise adverse publicity in the United States.   He proposes that majoremphasis in the United States should be given, to tobacco and that someformula be used to indicated that special consideration will be given tofruit and fruit products for the next stage of liberalisation.7.      The Commonwealth Secretary has consulted the Governments ofAustralia, South Africa and Malaya about the proposed liberalisation of canned fruit.   No reply has yet been received from Malaya, but Australiaand South Africa have both asked that liberalisation should be postponed until after the conclusion of the next Southern Dominion canned fruitseason, i. e. until next October.    The industries in all three countries willbe severely affected.   In 1958, Australia sent us  10.3 millions of cannedfruits, South Africa  12.3 millions and Malaya  0.7 millions.   Of thethree, South Africa will be the hardest hit.   Doth Australia and South Africahave mentioned their fears that the United States, which has large standingstockc of canned fruit, will unload these on the United Kingdom marketat cut prices, thus accentuating the blow to the Australian and South Africanindustries.   The Prime Minister will be visiting South Africa from27th January to 5th February.   If liberalisation is included in the February -March tranche, the South African Government will be notified of the rejection of their request at about the time when the Prime Minister arrives.It will therefore be necessary to consult him before a decision is taken.Other Items0.     I should also mention two other points considered by the economic policy Committee.(i) It is proposed to delay at any rate until July, I960 the removal of restrictions on the import of pharmaceuticals, by which time negotiations between the Health Departments and the United Kingdom industry about theproces of proprietory preparations prescribed under the National health service will have ended.(ii) Decisions on the freeing of imports of goods of Colonial interest.will be deferred pending a conference of representatives of the United K.ngdomthe West Indies, the United States and Canada to consider the problems whichwould arise from the removal of import restrictions on goods of interestto the West Indies.   The President of the Board of Trade is taking theopportunity of a visit ito Washington and Ottawa to suggest this course ofaction.   Meanwhile steps are being taken to extend the period during whichimports of fresh grapefruit from the dollar area are allowed to includeMarch I960, and to negotiate to increase from 5s. to 10s. a hundredweightthe preference on West Indian fresh grapefruit.9.     A further move by the United Kingdom at a very early date toliberalise imports is highly desirable in the light of the growing pressures on the United States Government to adopt less liberal and restrictiveattitudes in regard both to aid and trade.   And such a move would give a clear indication to the whole world of the importance we attach to the removalof unnecessary barriers to trade.   I therefore invite my colleagues toagree that -(i)     Liberalisation of the  items listed in paragraph 3 above should be announced during the first week after the reassembly of Parliament,preferably on 27th or 2Cth January, by which date the Prime Minister willhave left the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.-3-
SECRET13(ii) A decision to liberalise the items listed in paragraph 4 should be deferred for further consideration by the Economic Policy Committeein the light of the necessary consultations, including those with commonwealth governments;(iii) The intention to include canned fruit in a future list should be reported to the Prime Minister, who is due to arrive in the Union ofSouth Africa on 27th January.10.    I would propose to discuss with the Commonwealth Secretarywhether some indication can be given on the occasion of the firstannouncement that canned fruit (other than grapefruit and apples) isunder consideration for a further measure of liberalisation.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers,  S.W.1.15th January, I960-4-SECRET
