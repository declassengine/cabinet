C. (60) 48 Copy No. 5215th March, 1960CABINETCARLTON HOUSE TERRACENote by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentFollowing consideration by the Home Affairs Committee, a small committeeof Ministers under the chairmanship of the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment have considered the future of Carlton House Terrace. I agree withtheir report, which is attached to this note.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,14th March, 1960.CARLTON HOUSE TERRACEReport by the Minister of Housing and Local government small committee of Ministers under my chairmanship have been asked toconsider the future of Carlton House Terrace: whether the needs for accommodation for Government Departments will allow us to release it fairlysoon to the Crown Estate Commissioners, to whom it belongs, and, if so, on what conditions.2. The estimated needs in the Whitehall area over the next 10-15 yearsamount to about 1 million square feet of accommodation, to meet which it wouldin course of time be possible to provide about 1J million square feet on siteselsewhere which are actually or potentially available. If both the Nash facades ofCarlton House Terrace are to be preserved, it would be possible to reconstructithe premises as not altogether satisfactory Government office accommodation at something like twice the cost of new building. These two factors togetherhave led us to the conclusion that we should not retain the Terrace inGovernment occupation.3. This raises the question of alternative accommodation for the ForeignOffice staff who at present occupy it. They could be transferred, probably beforethe end of this year, to Queen Anne&apos;s Mansions, the whole of which the Minister ofWorks holds on lease. But the lease expires in 1968 and the Minister thinks it unlikely that he will be able to secure an extension. We are informed that thereis no prospect of housing the whole of the Foreign Office in one building before that date; and it follows that, unless the Minister can buy Queen Anne&apos;s Mansionsby agreement (for retention or subsequent resale), either the Foreign Office willhave to face two more temporary moves-which the Foreign Secretary isunderstandably reluctant to contemplate or we shall have to take the politicallyunattractive course of extending our tenure of Queen Anne&apos;s Mansions (perhapsonly temporarily) by compulsory purchase.56715Printed for the Cabinet.   March I960
4. We do not think that this dilemma should deter us from releasing CarltonHouse Terrace. But we hope that it will be possible, reasonably soon, to work out and reach agreement on a general plan for the use of the various sites which are,or are expected to become, available for Government accommodation in theWJulehall area.155. If the Cabinet agree that Carlton House Terrace should be released, werecommend acceptance of the Crown Estate Commissioners&apos; view th^t the whole area between Carlton Mews and Spring Gardens, including the site of the oldCounty Hall, should be redeveloped on a single, unified plan and that both facadesof the Terrace should be preserved, even though the possibility cannot be excludedthat part of the cost of redevelopment might in that case have to be met from public funds. This last point would depend to some extent on the purposes for whichredevelopment were to be allowed. We do not think that it would be compatible with general Government policy to allow the whole area to be redeveloped as offices.We suggest, therefore, that the Commissioners should be invited to agree theultimate user of the area with the Government and, as a first move, tp put theirown views before us. They have already expressed their willingness to secure thatsome part of the accommodation is made available for Governmerjt purposes, ifwanted.Summary6.   We recommend the Cabinet to agree (a) that, irrespective of any long-term plan for the accommodation ofGovernment Departments, Carlton House Terrace should be releasedas soon as possible to the Crown Estate Commissioners;(b) that we should accept the Commissioners&apos; view that there should be unifiedredevelopment of the whole area between Carlton Mews and SpringGardens, with the preservation of both facades of the Terrace;(c) that the Commissioners should be invited to agree with the Governmentthe purposes for which that area and the Terrace should be designedto be used; and(d) that progress should be made with the preparation of a phased long-term plan for the accommodation of Departments in the Whitehall area.H.
