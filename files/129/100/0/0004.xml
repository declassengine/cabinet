&apos;SECREirTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTFUTURE OF THE EAST AFRICAN LAND forces memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies in my previous memorandum on this subject (C. (60) 1), I invited my colleagues to agree that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should assume full administrative andfinancial responsibility for the East African Land Forces with effect from 1st July,1960, and that local contributions towards the cost of these forces need not besought; but that, if as a matter of principle they should be so required, I shouldbe given discretion to waive the principle (completely if necessary) if I was satisfiedthat it would help secure a satisfactory outcome of the Kenya Conference.2. My colleagues considered that the Chancellor of the Exchequer shouldhave an opportunity for further consideration of the financial implications of thisproposal (C.C. (60) 1st Conclusions, Minute 2). They also suggested that thepolitical aspects were even more important than its financial and administrativeaspects, as, while it would have the advantage of removing control of the east african Land Forces from discussion in the local Legislatures, it could be presented as a reversal of the policy we normally adopted when colonial territories weremoving towards independence. The Prime Minister felt that the weight to beattached to these opposing political considerations should determine the decisionto be taken.3. I asked the three East African Governors for their assessment of theprobable reaction of African politicians to the proposal, and whether they wouldsuspect that they were being &quot; deprived &quot; of their own armed forces in an attemptto defer ultimate independence. In particular, I asked the Governor of Tanganyikafor his advice on whether it would be prudent to sound Nyerere, the leader of the Tanganyika African National Union, informally before the decision was announced.The replies of the Governors are unanimous that the proposal is more likely to be welcomed by African politicians as a measure of financial relief than criticised asa move to delay independence. The Governor of Tanganyika added that he didnot think it necessary to make any informal approach to Nyerere. All threeGovernors emphasise, however, that the change should be publicly represented as a means of giving financial assistance to the East African Governments. extracts from their replies are attached in the Annex. In view of the Governors&apos; reassuringadvice on the likely reactions of African politicians, I do not think we need bedissuaded from carrying out this proposal on these grounds.4. Since our last meeting, I have also discussed with the Chancellor thefinancial aspects of the proposal. 1 understand that the Chancellor still feels thathe cannot agree to this proposal, in view of both the size of the commitment andalso its effect on other forms of expenditure. However, my colleagues decided atthe previous meeting that the political and strategic arguments should be the onesthat were to be decisive in the end and in view of the assurances I have receivedfrom the Governors it seems to me that the case is very strong for making thechange I suggest. Moreover, I feel that it would be best, if we decide to make this change, not to insist on a matching contribution from the three territories.Printed for the Cabinet.  January i960C.

5. I do not wish to seek the agreement of my colleagues to my announcinga decision at the moment. The Kenya Conference is about to begin, and if thecourse of its proceedings suggest the need to play this card, I shall have time toreturn to the Cabinet with a firm proposal.      &apos;recommendation. T;therefore invite my colleagues to agree in principle that:  (i) in view of the unanimous advice of the three East African Governors,Her Majesty&apos;s Government should assume full administrative andfinancial responsibility for the East African Land Forces with effect from 1st July, 1960;(ii) local contributions towards the cost of these forces, need not be sought.I. M.Colonial Office, S.W. 1,15th January, 1960.
ANNEXVIEWS OF EAST AFRICAN GOVERNORS ON LIKELY local political OBJECTIONSGovernor of Kenya:&quot; Political objection is not serious for Kenya. African politicians are inclined to criticise expenditure on the Army instead of on African development and welfare.This mind might develop strongly in 1960 if expansion of African education wasretarded owing to our need to surmount the post-emergency &quot; hump &quot;. If her majesty&apos;s Government take over the heavy East African Land Forces expenditure,politicians at worst might say that we do not need an Army anyway; but if her majesty&apos;s Government make clear that the transfer of responsibility is to enable us to spend more on education, agriculture, &amp;c, criticism will be blunted. It is unlikely in Kenya at the present stage that the point of &quot; deprivation &quot; of theirown armed forces will be thought of unless it is put into their heads. I suggest,however, that point could be met if Her Majesty&apos;s Government said that incidence of expenditure and responsibility would require review in keeping with economicand constitutional advance. I do not see any of the territories in the foreseeable future being in the financial position willingly to reassume expenditure.&quot;Governor of Uganda:&quot; I consider that, though there might be some criticism from those looking for something to criticise, the majority of people in Uganda would regard this as welcome financial assistance from Her Majesty&apos;s Government. However, Iconsider it important first that change should be publicly represented as a meansof giving financial assistance to East African Governments and so making more money available for social services.&quot;Governor of Tanganyika:&quot; The attitude of the Elected Members on armed forces was clearly statedin the course of debate in October last. Baker, who is Deputy Leader of the elected Members, said then that if for strategic reasons Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentdesired to maintain the existing armed forces they should do so but should pay for them.Against this background, I do not think it is necessary to sound Nyerereinformally, particularly if, in public presentation, the point is stressed that in reaching their decision Her Majesty&apos;s Government have had special regard to theterritory&apos;s present financial situation and the need to find more money for social services.I have no reason whatsoever to suppose that proposal, if adopted, would create suspicion that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were up to some Machiavelliantrick. Nyerere&apos;s likely reaction would be to accept the proposal with alacrityand to draw the conclusion that Her Majesty&apos;s Government had recognised theinevitability of a political crisis over the 1961-62 budget if this defence item werenot deleted and had decided to make the best of it.&quot;January I960
