Printed for the Cabinet. January I960C. (60) 11 Copy No.    g g29th January, 1960CABINETACCOMMODATION FOR MEMBERS OF parliament memorandum by the Minister of WorksPressure on accommodation in the Palace of Westminster, principally in theHouse of Commons area, has been increasing for some time and has now reached a point at which measures to relieve it cannot be much longer delayed.There are three possibilities:  (i) Reallocation of existing accommodation within the Palace, to ensure thatit is used to the best advantage.(ii) Provision of additional accommodation within the site of the Palace of westminster.(iii) Provision of additional accommodation outside, but conveniently near to,the Palace.2. Possibilities in the first category, which are intrinsically the most attractive,are hampered through the lack of any direct control by the two Houses, andparticularly by the Commons, over the premises which they occupy. This suggeststhe need to consider first whether the present system of control of the Palace of westminster should or could be changed. Until this is done no specific proposalsfor reallocation of accommodation can usefully be made. The question is discussed in this memorandum, and in addition some proposals for additional accommodationboth inside and outside the Palace are put forward.Control of the Palace of Westminster by the Lord Great Chamberlain3. The control of the Palace of Westminster is traditionally exercised by theLord Great Chamberlain. The precise basis for this control is not clear, but it hasbeen accepted without question for at least 250 years. When the House ofCommons is sitting, it has absolute control of the portion of the Palace which itoccupies, and this control (including allocation of rooms) is exercised by the Speakerthrough the Serjeant at Arms. Allocation of rooms in the House of Lords portionof the building is in the hands of the Lord Great Chamberlain.4. The difficulties of this system of control have become more apparent inrecent years, when the areas allocated to the two Houses have ceased to beproportional to the relative volume of the work which they have to perform.Members of the Commons, particularly in the Labour Party, have not been slow to point out its shortcomings, and to press for the removal of the Lord GreatChamberlain&apos;s powers, and their replacement by a system which would give the commons full control of their own building.5. Judged in the light of present day conditions, it is easy to understand thefeeling that the control exercised by the Lord Great Chamberlain is an anachronism,and that Parliament should be master in its own house; and if pressures on this front are going to increase, as well they may, it might be better for the Governmentto take the initiative rather than to appear to be forced by the Opposition to adopt this document is the property of her britannic majestvs government

a course of which, in fact, they approved. It might be thought sufficient for present purposes to remove only the powers of control which the Lord Great Chamberlainexercises over the Palace, leaving him the ceremonial duties which he performs atCoronations, State Openings of Parliament and other State Occasions. If the LordGreat Chamberlain&apos;s powers of control over the Palace are to be abolished,alternatives will have to be provided, possibly in the form of joint or separate^?afliamentary Commissions.Provision of Additional Accommodation for the Commons within the Palace ofWestminster6. Space for provision of additional accommodation within the Palace of westminster is limited. There is one courtyard where this could be done withoutinterfering seriously with traffic, lighting of existing rooms, or the appearance ofthe Palace. This is Star Chamber Court.Star Chamber Court7. There is room on the West side of this Court (adjoining Westminster Hall)to erect a new building. A permanent building would be extremely expensive, and because of the need to limit interference with the work of the House, would takequite two years to complete, but a temporary building could be erected herewithout affecting Westminster Hall for about  46,000, to provide some 6,700 sq. ft.of accommodation, on five floors. Each floor Could contain either one large room,some 80 ft. x 25 ft. or up to six smaller rooms, each suitable for an office for twoor three members. This building could be ready for occupation not more than12 months after the decision to go ahead.8. As this scheme was regarded as the only effective way of providing shortterm relief for the congestion in the House of Commons, it was considered by theHome Affairs Committee in November and December, 1959. The Committee feltthat, before a decision was taken, the views of both sides of the House of commons should be sought on the type of extra accommodation which would be most appropriate and the extent of the need for it.9. With regard to the principle of providing offices for Members, while I realise that the House is not unanimous, and that opinion in the Labour Partyappears to be more favourably disposed to it than in the Conservative Party, I feelthat the prospect of making some provision of this kind ought to be faced. If thisview is accepted the proposal for a temporary building in Star Chamber Courtcould be regarded as a first move in this direction, and would be a good way oftesting the extent of the demand.Building in New Palace Yard10. Sir Charles Barry&apos;s design for the Houses of Parliament included a schemefor sizeable buildings on the north and west sides of New Palace Yard. Therewould certainly be strong aesthetic objections to this as it would completely enclosethe Yard, but it is possible that a building on the north side of the Yard only, wherethe catalpa trees now stand, might be less controversial. Such a building would need to be very carefully designed so as to harmonise with the rest of the Palace,and for this reason the cost would probably be relatively high; the land would,however, cost nothing. This possibility might offer the opportunity ofproviding a certain amount of much-needed space in a very convenient position.Nevertheless, the fact must be faced that a building in this position will inevitablygive rise to a good deal of controversy. For this reason I am investigating thepossibility of constructing permanent accommodation elsewhere within the Palace.However, I am not optimistic that a solution on these lines will be found, and i therefore feel that I should be authorised to examine more closely the proposalfor a building on the north side of New Palace Yard.Provision of Additional Accommodation Outside the Palace of Westminster11. Shortage of space for extension within the Palace has led in recent years to investigation of the possibility of providing additional accommodation outside,but conveniently near to it. This last requirement has not proved easy to satisfy.
6-7 Old Palace Yard12. A small move in this direction has been taken with the decision to converta part of 6-7 Old Palace Yard for use by Members and Secretaries. This will beavailable in March, and will provide a lounge, an interview room, a conference room, two desk rooms for Members with eight desks in each and accommodation for 15-20 Secretaries.Designation of the Bridge Street Site13. A proposal that the land bounded by Parliament Street, Bridge Street,the Embankment and New Scotland Yard should be developed for Governmentuse was approved by the Home Affairs Committee in July 1959 and, with theagreement of the Prime Minister, steps are being taken to designate the site forthis purpose.Proposal by St. Stephens Club to Sell the Freehold of the Existing Building14. The area to be designated includes the St. Stephen&apos;s Club. The Clubhave not asked for alternative accommodation and have indicated that, with themoney they get from us, they should be able to find this themselves. The Chairmanof the Club, on his own initiative and subject to the approval of his members, hasoffered to sell to the Ministry of Works the freehold of the existing building, withvacant possession in about six months&apos; time. This would provide some 25,000 sq. ft.of accommodation suitable for use, with adaptations, for Parliamentary or other purposes. This proposal is under examination. No commitment has been enteredinto with the Club. If the economic aspect proved satisfactory, purchase of thebuilding could be recommended as a first stage in the designation proposal already described.Conclusions15.   I invite the Cabinet:  (i) To decide if the possibility should be examined of relieving the office ofLord Great Chamberlain of some at least of its powers and responsibilities.(ii) If so, to authorise the Home Secretary and me to examine the extent towhich, and the respects in which, changes might be recommended, with alternative proposals for the exercise of these powers and responsibilities.(iii) To approve the proposal to erect a temporary building in Star ChamberCourt.(iv) To authorise, examination of the possibility of erecting a building on thenorth side of New Palace Yard, or of getting additional permanent accommodation elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster.J. A. H.Ministry of Works, S.E. J,28th January, I960.
