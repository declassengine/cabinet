Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1960C. (60) 45 Copy No. ^,578th March, I960CABINETFUTURE OF THE SUEZ CANAL USERS&apos; ASSOCIATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs would like the advice of my colleagues upon the question of whether the suez Canal Users&apos; Association (S.C.U.A.) should continue on its present basis,viz., dormant but still technically in existence, or whether it should be finallywound up.^ 2. References to S.C.U.A. in Sir Anthony Eden&apos;s Memoirs recently stimulatedReuters to ask the Foreign Office News Department persistently whether theAssociation was still in existence or not. The News Department were authorisedto say that S.C.U.A. had never actually been brought to an end and was thereforestill technically alive. There have been no further questions. The continued existence of S.C.U.A. is however a potential source of embarrassment.3. The present position is as follows: S.C.U.A. has not met since August1958. There is no Administrator, secretariat or office. After it ceased to holdCouncil meetings for discussions of substance, the Association^ Executive Groupused to gather and discuss information about the operation of the Canal. But itsoon became apparent that the Egyptians were running the Canal tolerably well,and there were few complaints to discuss. No matter has since arisen which wouldhave been appropriately handled in S.C.U.A.4.   Arguments in favour of winding it up(a) It is difficult to conceive of a problem which discussion in or action throughS.C.U.A. would help to solve: a major crisis over the Canal wouldprobably go to the Security Council; in minor matters any hope of asatisfactory solution would be destroyed by the mere act of involving the Association, which is irrevocably tainted in Egyptian eyes.(b) The continued existence of S.C.U.A. could be an embarrassment in ourrelations with the United Arab Republic.(c) There are other possible avenues of approach, e.g.(i) The International Chamber of Shipping now has a line ofcommunication with the Suez Canal Authority.(ii) The International Bank is now involved through the conditions forthe operation of the Canal written into the recent loan agreement for Canal development.(iii) There is also the International Maritime Consultative organisation which could be brought into play.(d) There is not likely to be any serious opposition to winding it up, either from our ship-owners or from other member Governments (wxcept perhaps France).5.   Arguments against winding it up(a) It would give the Egyptians an opportunity to claim a propaganda victory.(b) Apart from the recent enquiry by Reuters there is no public interest inS.C.U.A. and the sleeping dog might therefore best be left to lie.56676
6. If it were decided to wind up S.C.U.A., it must clearly be done with theminimum of fuss in order to avoid difficulty under paragraph 5 (a) above. this could probably be achieved by our proposing to the member Governments that itbe wound up without any meeting or announcement. Thereafter enquiries wouldbe answered by saying merely that it was no longer in existence. Before puttingsuch a proposal to members generally we should first want to take confidentialpoundings of the United States and French Governments, and the Minister ofTransport might wish to consult our shipowners.S. l.Foreign Office, S.W.1,7 th March, 1960.
