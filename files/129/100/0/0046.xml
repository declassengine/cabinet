AGRICULTURE ACTS, 1947 AND 1957ANNUAL REVIEW AND determination of GUARANTEES, 1960I.   introduction. The 1960 Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects ofthe agricultural industry has now been held in accordance with Section 2 ofthe Agriculture Act, 1947. In the light of it, and of the long-term assurancesprovided for in the Agriculture Act, 1957, the Government have determined the guarantees for livestock and livestock products for the year April, 1960,to March, 1961, and for crops from the 1960 harvest. These are set out inAppendix VI.ill.   Economic Condition of the Agricultural industry the Course of Production2. Agricultural net output has increased markedly. For 1959-60 it is forecast at 168 per cent of pre-war, compared with 161 per cent for 1958-59,when net output was adversely affected by the bad weather. Net output thisyear is substantially aibove the figure of 162 per cent for 1957-58, thehighest figure previously recorded.3. A new index of agricultural net output has been introduced this year ;details are given in Appendix I. This index is not strictly comparable withthe present one and both will be published for the time being. The new indexis more responsive than the present one to year-to-year changes. For thenew index the average net output of the three years 1954-55 to 1956-57 hasbeen taken as 100. On this basis net output for 1959-60 is forecast at 116compared with 104 for 1958-59 and 105 for 1957-58.4. The total arable area was maintained in 1959, although the tillagearea declined mainly as a result of the poor ploughing season in the autumn of 1958. This was followed by unfavourable sowing conditions but,although in consequence there was a low acreage of cereals, there were recordyields and total production of cereals was greater than ever before. Thedry summer seriously affected pastures and reduced the yields of most rootsand green fodder crops and the production of silage. On the other hand,yields of potatoes and beet sugar were good and the hay crop, though onlyaverage in quantity, was of excellent quality. There has been a further increase in the number of calves retained for beef production. Productionof sheep has continued to increase. There has been a decline in the outputof pigmeat, and a further fall in the pig breeding herd in the United Kingdomdespite an increase in Northern Ireland. Production of milk is rising again and is expected to be higher than in 1958-59; there has been a further increase in sales for liquid consumption. Egg production has continued to expand. The usage of concentrated feedingstuffs, which rose sharply in1958-59, remains at a high level.
Changes in Income5. There has been a satisfactory recovery in actual net income. the forecast for 1*959-60 is  356  million,  41 million above the revised figure for 1958-4?^, and much the same as.the record level of  358 million attainedin 1957-58. When adjusted for normal weather conditions, the forecast for1959-60 is  355J million, compared with a revised estimate of  362 million for 1958-59. Normal net income has therefore been maintained at aboutthe same high level as in recent years......Efficiency6. At the last Review, as previously, the Government assessed, theihdustry&apos;s increasing efficiency at about  25 minion for review commodities,which represents a gain of about 2 per cent per annum on gross output.Only a broad estimate can be made, but in the Governrnent&apos;s view theindustry^ efficiency continues to increase at least at this rate/taking one year with another.Changes inCosis7. There has been a further net increase in the cost -of goods and services used in agriculture, mainly due to the increase in the cost of labour.The net increase for review commodities is nearly  13 million, afterexcluding feed costs for pigs and eggs, which are reflected automatically inadjustments to the guarantees for those commodities. This is a little morethan the net increases last year and the year before.Cost of Agricultural Support8. There has been an increase in the cost to the Exchequer of support for the industry. The total for 1959-60 is estimated at about  259 million,compared with  241 million last year; details are given in Appendix V.This increase is mainly due to greater expenditure on the production grants,but there has also been a net increase in the cost of the price guarantees.The total subsidy bill continues to be a heavy burden on the taxpayer. it also affects relations with the Commonwealth and other food supplying countries.III.  Production and Guarantee Policies9. Production and guarantee policies have been reviewed in the lightof developments during the past year and of the prospects for the industryand for the nation.&apos; 10. The industry&apos;s output has continued to expand. The outlook forthe future must be assessed in the light of the prospective demand for food and the supplies likely to be available at competitive prices. If presenttrends continue, demand is unlikely to increase as rapidly as total supplies,though within this general picture there are- differences between theindividual commodities.Production Policy&apos;11. As the&apos;Government have emphasised in recent years, the industry must increasingly turn its attention to reducing unit costs of productionand to getting the best returns from the market.   This the,industry can
do by improving its methods, by better use of its resources, and where necessary by relatively small and gradual changes in the emphasis on different products. The need to make progress in these directions is allthe greater as the tendency for supplies to outstrip demand continues.Indeed, unless such progress is made, maintenance of reasonable standardsfor those engaged in the industry would not be possible without increasingthe burden on the taxpayer. The industry&apos;s success, both for itself and for the nation, therefore depends now primarily on the extent towhich it can improve its profitability in these ways, and is not to be measured by volume of output alone.12. What is required is a steady and continuing improvement not onlyin farming methods but also in the management and operation of the farm as a business. The way in which unit costs can be reduced will vary from farm to farm. In general there is room to improve resultsby more economical use of labour, machinery and other resources. Oneexample of this is the elimination of wasteful feed practices through more effective use of grass and other home-grown feedingstuffs. It will also paymany farmers to examine more closely the different lines of production on their farms with the object of concentrating on the more remunerativelines at the expense of others. These suggestions may seem obvious ; butin practice to identify and correct weaknesses in management on theindividual farm is not always simple, and much still remains to be donein these directions. The other important aim is to improve the quality and saleability of output by eliminating so far as practicable those grades of produce that bring in poor market returns, and concentrating on produce of the kinds and qualities that best meet market requirements.13. The development of production along these lines is the most effective way in which the industry can equip itself to maintain its share of theslowly expanding market and to increase profitability while reducing depen-dence on financial support from the Exchequer. The industry has a firmfoundation in the Governments guarantee policy and the long-term assurances of the Agriculture Act, 1957, which the Government have under-taken to maintain unchanged for the duration of the present Parliament.Commodity Objectives14. Within the framework of general policy, the particular aims shouldbe as follows:  (i) continuing emphasis on the better production and use of grass asa means towards reducing costs of production.    In general, thiswill call for the maintenance or increase of the area of rotation;v grass; &apos;Hlip3$. mi(ii) although barley and oats are in general to be preferred to wheat,the extent to which particular cereal crops are produced should depend on the economics of the individual farm ;(iii) for milk the aim should be to gear production to a level more closely in line with requirements for liquid consumption, includingthe necessary reserve ;(iv) the output of eggs should be reduced ;530037 a 2
(v) for beef the aim at present should be to maintain the fate of expansion of production now in prospect, with continued emphasis on producing the quality wanted by the market and at reasonable prices;(vi) for mutton and lamb the need is to check expansion and to discourage production of animals less acceptable to the market;(vii) for pigs the aims should be to secure a moderate increase in thebreeding herd, but to avoid an increase to a level which would put an unreasonable burden on the taxpayer.IV.   Long-Term Assurances15. In accordance with the Agriculture Act, 1957, the present deter rminations must be such as to maintain the total value of the guarantees atnot less than 97^ per cent of their total value in 1959-60, after allowing forcost changes that have occurred on review commodities since the 1959Annual Review. In addition the guaranteed price for each commodity mustbe maintained at not less than 96 per cent of the corresponding price deter-mined after the 1959 Annual Review; and, in the case of livestock and livestock products, at not less than 91 per cent of the corresponding pricesdetermined after the 1957 Annual Review.16. The total value of the guarantees (including relevant production grants) for this purpose at the 1960 Annual Review was calculated to beabout  1,270 million, and 97^ per cent of this is  1,238^ million. After theaddition of the relevant cost increase of nearly  13 million, the lower limit for the Governments determination is a reduction of about  19 million inthe total value of the guarantees.V.   Governments Conclusions17. While market prospects differ from one commodity to another, theindustry must seek increasingly not only to reduce costs of production but toget the best returns from the market. The burden on the Exchequer, whichhas. increased during the past year, may otherwise increase still further. Itis also desirable in the interests of trade relations, especially with theCommonwealth, to reduce the dependence of the industry on exchequer support by discouraging the highest-cost production.18. These considerations have to be balanced with the need to enablethe industry to maintain a fair and reasonable level of remuneration inaccordance with the Agriculture Act, 1947. The industryS efficiency con-tinues to increase and its general position appears to be sound. On theother hand, costs have continued to increase and the industryS. net incomeon a normal weather basis is not at present rising.19. While the long-term assurances would have permitted a reductionof about  19 million in the total value of the guarantees, the Governmenthave decided that there should this year be a reduction of about  9 million.
vi.   Determination of Guarantees20. The determinations to be made were those for livestock and livestock products for the year April; 1960, to March, 1961, and those for crops of the1960 harvest. The determinations for the particular commodities are set outin Appendix VI.  The main features are as follows.Milk21. After the temporary fall in 1958-59, the upward trend of milk production has been resumed despite the adverse effect on yields in, the latesummer of 1959 of the exceptionally low rainfalh The increase this year is small but a somewhat larger increase is forecast for 1960-61. There hasbeen a slight increase during the past year in sales for liquid consumption;Even so, the surplus above the requirements of the liquid market, after allowing for the reserve needed to ensure that the market is adequatelysupplied throughout the year, amounts to something between 10 and 15per cent of total output. The forecast for 1960-61 is that this surplus&quot; wiljbe substantially increased. As the Government emphasized in the 1959Annual Review White Paper (Cmnd. 696), production in this country of milk for manufacture in excess of the reserve required for the liquid market is hoteconomic at anything like present costs of production and reduces the averagereturn to producers. The Government have concluded that the guaranteed price should be reduced by 0-25d. per gallon.22. On the other hand, there is every reason to encourage the industryto expand the liquid milk market. This is a consideration which theGovernment have had in mind in discussing with representatives of the producers the policy to be adopted in future for making alterations&apos; in thestandard quantities for the Various milk marketing areas in the UnitedKingdom. They have decided that, as an incentive to the industry tocontinue its successful efforts to encourage liquid consumption, the standard quantity for each milk marketing area should be automatically adjustedaccording to changes in liquid sales in that area from one year to another.Accordingly, for 1960-61 the standard quantity which applied to each area in 1959-60 Will be increased by the amount by which sales of milk forliquid consumption in that area in the calendar year 1959 exceeded thecorresponding figure for the calendar year 1958. This amounts in total fo19-5 million gallons, equivalent to an increase in the guaranteed price of1-17d. per gallon:Eggs23-. Last year the Government repeated the view expressed after the1958 Annual Review that production of eggs should be reduced ; ahd the guaranteed price was reduced for the third successive year. Despite this there has been a further substantial increase in&apos; producfidn. Although pro-ducers&apos; returns have been adversely affected during the past year by thefall in market prices, the efficiency of egg production is still increasihgV Withthe&apos; guaranteed price much above the market price, the total subsidy oneggs has increased, and the rate of subsidy is now more than one-thirdof the market.price. The Governments conclusion is that there, shouldbe a further reduction of T38d. per dozen in the guaranteed price forhen eggs.^730037 a 3
&apos; 24. Experience in the past three years of the working, of the profit and loss sharing arrangements between the Government and the British EggMarketing:: Board has shown that -they may. result in unduly large anderratic fluctuations in producers&apos; prices from year to year. This has dis-advantages: for both producers and the Government. After consultationwith representatives of producers, the Government have decided to introduce in .1960--61 changes in the profit and loss sharing arrangements designedto reduce such fluctuations.  Details are given in Appendix VI.Fat Cattle  &apos;* &apos; r       &apos; &apos; -v25. Output of beef, which declined substantially in 1958-59, is expectedto show a further slight fall in 1959-60, mainly because of a sharp reductionin imports of stores from the Irish Republic. Provided these importsrecover, output of beef should increase in 1960-61, and continue to increasethereafter,. The demand for beef continues strong, with no early prospectof any large increase in total supplies though the outlook in the longer term is less certain. The guaranteed price has been increased substantially in recent years ; and after the 1959 Annual Review the Government gave,through the hill cow and the calf subsidies, further encouragement to therearing;of beef store cattle. The aim now is to maintain the rate of expansion that is in prospect. The Government have decided that the guaranteed price should be left unchanged.Fat Pigs26. Output of pigmeat in 1959-60 is forecast at about 8 per cent belowthe 1958-59 level and at approximately the same level as in 1957-58. TheGovernment have decided in accordance with the commodity objective for pigs (paragraph 14 (vii)) that some encouragement to production is required.The quality premiums payable on pigs sold by grade and deadweight atbacon factories will continue to be paid at the existing rates but in futurethey will be paid in addition to, and will not be included in the calculation of, the general guarantee payment on all pigs. The effect of this is thesame as if the guaranteed price for all pigs had been increased by 6d. ascore and it will remove the disadvantage that a large part of the cost of thequality premiums has fallen on producers of other types of pig for whichit has not been possible to introduce similar premiums. In addition, the-guaranteed price will be increased by 3d. a score, making a total increaseequivalent to 9d. a score.27. The arrangements introduced in 1959 for ensuring more stablereturns to all types of pig producers will be continued but in order to: facilitate the introduction of a system of long-term contracts the stabilisingbands for I960 -61 will be narrowed from 3s. Od. a score to 2s. 3d. a scoreon each side of the guaranteed price.Fat Sheep.   28. Production has continued to expand, though at a slower rate.  With-imports also continuing to increase, total supplies of mutton and lamb areexpected to be about 9 per cent higher than in 1958-59 and a further thoughsmaller increase is expected next year. The subsidy in 1959-60 will be more
than double that for 1958-59, and over the year as a whole the unit rate of subsidy will average about half the market price. This is due in part toabnormally heavy marketings at the peak period ; but the prospect, even with a more normal pattern of marketings, is of continuing heavy subsidy.It has therefore been decided to reduce the guaranteed price for fat sheep byJd. per lb.   ---&apos;!- , ; -    &apos;       -29. In order to provide some further encouragement to the marketing of fat sheep and lambs at lighter weights, the maximum weights in respectof which guarantee payments may be made are to be reduced. The basisof the guarantee is also being modified to exclude those types of animalsleast acceptable to the market.Wool -    - ii Urtippi fe&quot; Sc^ir/jr1 &amp;&apos;,&apos; &apos; 30. The Government^ policy, as reaffirmed in the 1959 Annual review white Paper, is that taking one year with another the wool guarantee shouldnot require continuing Exchequer payments. The guaranteed price has remained above the market price since the first year of the present guarantee arrangements, and the present prospect is of contiriuingsubsidy. On present estimates, the debt from the British Wool Marketing Board to the exchequer at 30th April, 1960, will be nearly  12 million ; under the financial agree-ment with the Board, the Exchequer will have to write off nearly  9 million of this. The Government have decided-fo reduce the guaranteed price byId. per lb.Cereals31. World supplies of cereals are ample; and the Commonwealth is animportant producer of wheat. The subsidies on home-produced cereals are- costly to the Exchequer and high in relation to market value lor all threeprincipal crops. There is little prospect of a reduction in the exchequer cost, save by reduction in the guaranteed prices. Production of all threecrops would, in general, continue to be remunerative even at a somewhatlower level of guarantee. A reduction of 8d. per cwt. is being made in the guaranteed price for wheat; and reductions of 3d. per cwt. in the guaranteed prices for barley and oats.. Potatoes32. Yields from the 1959 crop are above normal and production isexpected to show an increase of about 23 per cent on 1958-59, with- aconsiderable surplus above the requirements for human consumption. as already announced, with the object of helping to maintain prices to. growersat a reasonable level for the.rest.of the season and of avoiding the needfor a deficiency payment, the Government have agreed to bear, a substantialshare of any losses which may be incurred by the Potato Marketing board in a purchasing programme to strengthen the market for potatoes in the exceptional circumstances of the 1959 crop. The Government have under-taken to consider with representatives of the producers, in the light ofthis yearS experience, what action within the framework of the presentguarantee arrangements might appropriately be taken if similar circum-stances arise in future. This consideration will cover the problems; Whichmay arise in Northern Ireland.
33. So long as there is no substantial decline in consumption, thepresent acreage is about right. But the fall in returns from the 1959crop may have an unduly discouraging effect on plantings in I960. Withthis possibility in mind, the Government have decided to increase the guaranteed price by 5s. 6d. per ton.Sugar Beet34- Each ye^r the contract acreage is over-subscribed ; and sugar isin ample supply. The Government have decided to reduce the guaranteed price by 2s. 6d. per ton.Production Grants35. The present subsidy on lime is at the rate of 60 per cent for mostof the year with an increase to 70 per cent for a period of seventeen weeks in the summer. The higher seasonal rate is now tending to concentratetoo much demand in a limited period. Accordingly, the subsidy for1960-61 will be at a flat rate of 65 per cent throughout the year,36. The prices of the bulk of fertilisers sold in the United kingdom have fallen in the last two years and the rates of subsidy now represent on average about 45 per cent of the prices of the principal straight phosphaticand straight nitrogenous fertilisers. Some individual claims already haveto be reduced to keep them within the statutory limit of 5Q per cent of farmers&apos; costs. The Government have therefore decided to introduceslightly lower rates of subsidy from 1st July next, which at the present levelof consumption are estimated to reduce the total fertiliser subsidy byabout  1^ million.VII.   Effect of Determinations37. The determinations now made are soxne  10 million above theminimum assured by the Agriculture Act, 1957. The net income of. theIndustry depends on many factors apart from the level of the guarantees,not least the industry&apos;s ability to adapt itself to changing circumstances.These determinations meet the requirements, of national policy regarding theproduction of the guaranteed commodities. The Government consider thatthey provide a fair and balanced answer to the two-fold problem of, on theone hand, enabling agriculture to maintain its prosperity and, on the, other,protecting the taxpayer from an increasing burden.

These two series of aggregate farming net income are calculated in fundamentally different ways. The &quot; Departmental&quot; estimate is built up fromstatistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot; national&quot; farm, whereas the&quot; raised sample &quot; is based on some 3,600 actual farm accounts, which are expanded or &quot; raised &quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the United Kingdom.

Both series are of value in indicating the general trend in the level of income.Note (Hi),; The figures for aggregate net income in Table A include as profit inrecent years about  9 million on the production of food for consumption in the farmhousehold. In other industries the corresponding sums are not treated as profit andare relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent).Note (iv).

Od.Notes on Price Tables(a) As in 1959-60, the guaranteed price for pigs for 1960-61 in Northern Ireland is subjectto a reduction of Id. per score, to take account of certain expenditure incurred on pig progenytesting stations in that country.(b) The guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep and wheat are average prices subjectto variation seasonally; the guarantee payments for fat cattle arid some fat pigs are subjectto variation according to quality; and the method of calculating fatstock guarantee, paymentsinvolves an element of estimation. Because the marketings of fatstock and wheat cannotbe accurately forecast, producers&apos; average returns under the guarantees for those products in any year may be a little more or less than the guaranteed prices. The prices guaranteedto the British Egg Marketing Board for hen and duck eggs are subject to profit and losssharing arrangements in accordance with the terms of a financial agreement between theGovernment and the Board.(c) As a i result of the change from a fixed tonnage of potatoes for hurnan consumption in 1959-60 to a tonnage based on actual sales in 1960-61 and subsequent years (see para-graph 15 of Part II of this Appendix), there is a. slight narrowing in the definition of &quot;.sales for human consumption &quot;. On this revised basis the guaranteed; price of 254s. Qd. per tonfor the 1959 crop would have been equivalent to 254s. 6d. per ton. .Part II.  Additional Details of GuaranteesFatstock .1. The guaranteed prices fox fat cattle, fat sheep and lambs and fat pigs for. 1960^61are on the basis of a deficiency payments scheme similar to that in operation for1959-60, except as stated in the following paragraphs.2. Fat Cattle. With effect from 28th March, 1960, the maximum weight forheifers, (other than those which have grown not more than two broad teeth and haveretained six calf teeth) that may qualify as Grade I for the higher rate of guaranteepayment will be increased from.9 cwt. to 9  cWt. liveweight (from 600 lb. to 620 lb.deadweight). . . .3; The differential of 5s. Od. per live cwt. between the rates of guarantee payment for Grade I arid Grade II cattle will be applied by increasing the average rate of guarantee payments for home-bred cattle by Is. lOd. for Grade I and reducing it by3s. 2d. for Grade II. The resultant rates of payment will be rounded to the nearest6d. If in respect of any week, the average rate of guarantee payment is 3s..2d. percwt..or less, there, will be no guarantee payment on Grade II animals arid appropriaterates, to be announced separately, will be paid only on Grade I.        -
4. Fat Sheep. The guarantee will apply to fat lambs, hoggets and other cleansheep conforming to the following specification: &quot; If presented at a deadweight centre the carcase must be reasonably wellfleshed throughout. The loins must be well developed, the legs and shouldersmoderately well fleshed but the forequarters may be relatively heavy. Theflesh should be firm. The carcase should be reasonably well finished but it mustnot have such an excess of external fat or carry such heavy kidney knobs as willdepreciate seriously its value. If presented at a liveweight certification centre,the animal must, in the opinion of the fatstock officer, be such as to produce acarcase of at least the standard specified above.&quot;5. As in previous years there will be no upper limit to the weight at which livesheep or their carcases may be certified, but any guarantee payment will be restricted to the following weights: Dressed Carcase Weight^28th March, 1960     27th June, 1960to 26th June, 1960  to 28th May, 1961Lambs    ...      ... 601b. 55 1b.Hoggets  ...... 70 lb. 70 lb.Other clean sheep 801b. 701b.On 29th May, 1961, the maximum weight on which payment will be made onhoggets and other clean sheep will be reduced to 65 lb.* In the case of sales by liveweight estimated d.c.w.In the case of sales by deadweight actual d.c.w.6. Fat Pigs. The guarantee arrangements for pigs for 1960-61 will provide for two rates of quality premium under broadly the same conditions as in 1959-60,except that the quality premiums will be additional to the guaranteed price for fatpigs shown in column (iii) of Table A of this Appendix. Under these arrangements the total average return on eligible pigs sold by grade and deadweight to bacon factorieswill be guaranteed at the sum of (a) the average market price of pigs of the appropriategrade, (b) the deficiency payment (if any) payable on the basis of the guaranteed price for fat pigs and (c) 3s. Od. per score for Grade AA+ or 2s. Od. per score forGrade AA.7. For the purpose of stabilising arrangements, average returns will continue to be calculated separately for (i) pigs sold to bacon curers by grade and deadweight andcertified at approved bacon factories and (ii) for other certified pigs, but the separateweekly returns will be stabilised within 2s. 3d. per score of the guaranteed price (asadjusted in accordance with the feedingstuffs formula) instead of 3s. Od. per score asat present.8. As in previous years, the guaranteed price for pigs in 1960-61 will be subjectto adjustment in accordance with the operation of a feedingstuffs formula. Forthis purpose the guaranteed price for 1960-61 is related to a standard feed price of27s. Id. per cwt.Eggs9. The guarantees for hen and duck eggs in 1960-61 will be on the same basis asin 1959-60 except for changes in the profit and loss sharing arrangements. For eachproduct a flat rate of subsidy will be calculated by subtracting from the guaranteed priceshown in column (iii) of Table A of this Appendix the estimated average selling price to be determined by Ministers on a similar basis to that adopted in 1959-60.The flat rate of subsidy will be payable to the British Egg Marketing Board inaccordance with the provisions of a financial agreement to be concluded between theGovernment and the Board. It will provide for adjustments under revised profitand loss sharing arrangements in any year when the estimated average selling pricediffers from the average realised price for fresh eggs calculated in accordance withthe agreement. Previously adjustments were made only if these prices differed bymore than 2d. per dozen.
; 10. Under the revised profit and loss sharing arrangements, if the average realisedprice for fresh eggs, calculated as provided in the financial agreement between theGovernment and the Board, differs from the estimated average selling price, thedifference will be treated as follows: (i) profits will be shared initially as to 75 per cent to the Board and 25 percent to the Government;(ii) the Board will allocate 40 per cent of their, share of profits (i.e. 30 per cent of the total profit) to a reserve fund and retain the balance for disposal asthey see fit;(iii) this reserve fund will be used to meet losses in accordance with detailed arrangements to be agreed between the Government and the Board;(iv) losses not provided for in (iii) above will be borne on the basis of 60 percent by the Government and 40 per cent by the Board, except that any loss in excess of 6d. per dozen below the estimated price will be borne as to90 per cent by the Government.The ultimate shares of the Board and the Government in profits and losses havebeen so fixed that the guarantees for hen and duck eggs to be provided under the revised arrangements are estimated to be equivalent in value to those which wouldhave been provided under the previous arrangements if they had been continued.11. As in previous years, the guaranteed prices for eggs in 1960-61 will be subjectto adjustment in accordance with the operation of a feedingstuffs formula. For thispurpose the guaranteed prices for 1960-61 are related to a standard feed price of26s. 5d. per cwt.Wool12. The guaranteed price for 1960-61 is an average price per lb. to be receivedby the British Wool Marketing Board for wool (other than skin wool) produced inthe United Kingdom and tendered to the Board during the twelve months commencing1st May, 1960. As in previous years the guarantee will be implemented in accordancewith the provisions of the financial agreement concluded in November, 1955, betweenthe Government and the Board.Milk13. The guarantee for 1960-61 is on the same basis as in 1959-60, except thatthe standard quantities for each area in 1960-61 will be as follows: million gallonsIncrease New StandardQuantityEngland and Wales    ............    17-3 1,678-8Main Scottish Area    ............      0-9 183-9Aberdeen and District............     0-1 19-north of Scotland     ............      0-2 9-2Northern Ireland      ............      1-0 96-0Cereals14. The guaranteed prices for cereals for 1960-61 are on the basis of a deficiency round scheme similar to that in operation for 1959-60.Potatoes15. The guarantee for 1960-61 will be on the basis of a deficiency paymentsscheme similar to that in operation for 1959-60 except that, for the purposes of estimating the tonnage of home-produced potatoes (other than new potatoes) to whichthe guarantee applies in 1960-61, the following classes of sale for human consumption by growers of their own production will be included: (a) In Great Britain(i) sales by growers (including licensed grower-salesmen and licensedmerchants) to licensed merchants;(ii) sales by licensed grower-salesmen and licensed merchants other than to licensed merchants;(iii) sales by growers to the Potato Marketing Board;(iv) sales by growers other than under (j), (ii) and (iii) above but in accordancewith the terms of a licence issued by the Potato Marketing Board.
(b) In Northern Ireland(i) sales by growers (including registered grower-salesmen and registeredmerchants) to registered merchants; .(ii) sales by registered grower-salesmen and registered merchants other than to registered merchants.16. The relevant tonnages will be estimated from returns by merchants and (inrespect of certain sales) by growers and, where necessary, from information supplied by the Potato Marketing Board. An appropriate deduction will be made at the endof the season in respect of exports.17. The average market price will be estimated from returns of the prices per tonpaid to growers for potatoes purchased for human consumption. Prices will betaken on ex-farm or free on rail basis, the buyer providing sacks.18. The arrangements under which a transport subvention may be paid by theExchequer on shipments to Great Britain of potatoes grown in Northern Ireland willbe continued. For the time being arrangements will also be made, if that should benecessary in a year of heavy surplus, to process potatoes in factories in NorthernIreland. In that event the difference between the purchase cost of potatoes forprocessing and the receipts from the sale of the processed product will be a first charge on the Northern Ireland share of any deficiency payment.Sugar Beet19. The guarantee arrangements for sugar beet for 1960-61 will be on a similar basis to those in operation in 1959-60.20. For 1961/62, the contribution by the British Sugar Corporation to the cost oftransporting beet to factories in England and Wales will be for agreement between theCorporation and growers, representatives, in accordance with Section 17(3) of the sugar Act, 1956.(30037) wt.     -Printed in England and published by her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office12,75,83    3/60  D.L.
