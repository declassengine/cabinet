&apos;HT5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Co(60) 8 COPY NO.   \18th January, 1960CABINETIMPERIAL AND NATIONAL SERVICESGRANT TO THE METROPOLITAN POLICEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have carefully considered the case which the Home Secretary puts forward in his memorandum C.(60) 5;  but I fear that I am forced to the sameconclusion as in my own original memorandum C.(59) 140.2.      It does not seem to me to be open to Question that the London ratepayergains more from the fact that London is the capital than he pays in respectof the particular police duties which are attributable to its position as thecapital.   He must derive considerable, though not calculable, financialbenefit from the presence of the Sovereign and Government Departments., inLondon.     In addition, he gains in certain particular respects as follows:-(i) The formula of the general grant is weighted in favour of London tothe extent of nearly  1 million.(ii) The rate deficiency grant confers a further advantage, approaching 500,000 on the metropolis.(iii) Several services, which in other cases would be, in whole or in part,a charge on municipal funds are, in the case of London, financed whollyby the Exchequer;(a) Galleries and museumaj(c.O;Sting over  4 millions a year).(b) The upkeep of the Royal Parks, costing a boat  750,000 a year.(c) The salaries of the senior officials in the Metropolitan police force, together with the salaries of the London stipendiarymagistrates, aggregating over  100,000 a year.3.     I agree that, even allowing for the particular items which I havequoted above, it is not possible to assess precisely the full measure offinancial advantage which London derives from being the metropolis ofthe kingdom and one of the main centres of commerce, tourism and so forth.But, in the light of these considerations, I am convinced that there is no case for an increase in the present level of the grant.   Indeed, I believe thatthe change in circumstances since 1909 has been so considerable and so-1-
greatly to the advantage of London that the grant should now be abolishedaltogether.   I am prepared not to press this point at the present stagejbut at a time when the demands on the Exchequer are mounting far moresharply than expected in respect of many other proposals to which mycolleagues attach high priority in the national interest, I must really ask my colleagues not to press me to accept an additional provision in theforthcoming estimates for a service whose claim is as doubtful as this one appears to be.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.18th January, I960-2-SECRET
