Copy No.C. (60) 3529th February, I960CABINET49FUTURE POLICY STUDY, 1960-70Note by the Prime minister in June of last year I held an informal meeting at Chequers to discuss thepossibility of making a long-range study of our oversea policy during the next decade. My idea was that we should try to forecast what the state of the world would be in 1970 and what role the United Kingdom would be able to play in it.I thought that, if they had this picture before them. Ministers would be better ableto formulate policies for the intervening years which would allow us to continueto play a significant part in world affairs.2. In the light of the discussions at that meeting I asked the Secretary of theCabinet to arrange for such a study to be made by a group comprising the Chiefs ofStaff and the Heads of the Civil Departments directly concerned. This group hasnow completed its task and its report is attached.3. I am circulating this for information to all members of the Cabinet.I propose to discuss the report with the Ministers most directly concerned at aseries of meetings to be arranged over the next few weeks. But, apart from these meetings, I think that the report will provide a valuable background for discussions which we shall have to hold over the months ahead on specific questions of oversea policy.H.

(60) 124th February, I960FUTURE POLICY STUDY 1960-70PART ITHE INTERNATIONAL SETTINGThe Shifting Balance of power. In 1957 the population of the world was about 2,800 million. In 1970it will be nearly 3,500 million an increase of nearly a quarter in 13 years.2. This very rapid growth will be unevenly spread. It will be greatest inLatin America and Asia, middling in the United States and the USSR and least in Western Europe and the United Kingdom. With it will come changes in the pattern of economic (and therefore military) power, again uneven but differentlydistributed. The United States and the USSR will increase their already formidablelead over the rest of the world; the United Kingdom and Western Europe willcontinue to grow, though more slowly; by contrast, the under-developed countries,with their rapidly expanding populations and relatively inert economies, will behard put to it to advance at all, and some may fall still further behind than theyare now. Economic growth in our colonies may, however, continue at a slightly higher rate than that at which the population increases. None of the under-developed countries, with the possible exceptions of China and India, are likelyto develop a significant industrial base.3. The most important comparison is that of the United States (populationabout 204 million in 1970), the Soviet Union (250 million), and the United Kingdom(54 million) and Western Europe (E.E.C. countries 179 million). No predictionof exact rates of economic growth can be made. But the following general pointsseem clear:  (a) The economic growth of the USSR will be faster than that of the UnitedStates. By 1970 the USSR&apos;s consumption of steel and energy (thebest simple measure) will probably have reached the United States&apos;in 1957 and the industrial ratio between the two will fall from about\: 1 to about H: 1.(b) The European Economic Community is of immense potential importance.Their aggregate industrial power is probably greater than that of theUSSR and if they continue to grow at their recent pace they willapproach and perhaps reach the present United States level by 1970.If, therefore, the &quot; Six &quot; achieve a real measure of integration, a new world power will have come on the scene.(c) Even if the Lhiited Kingdom&apos;s economy expands at the rate required to&quot; double the national income in 25 years &quot; (2-8 per cent, per annum),we shall fall still further behind the other groups. Though in absolute terms our economic resources should grow significantly, our relative position vis-a-vis both the United States and Western Europe willnevertheless decline.

4. Of the countries of Asia and Africa, India and China stand out as the^only two which can enter the great Power class. China&apos;s course is very difficui^Pto predict. Although she will need at least a decade to prepare a sound base, shewill probably have reached real industrial strength by 1970 an achievement whichwill outstrip anything that India can do in the time, even with generous Westernaid. India could in the end develop comparable strength. But she can hardlydo more in the 1960s than reach the threshold of a real advance. In the long term the differences in the climate and in the aptitude of the Chinese and Indian peoplesfor hard work will tell heavily in favour of China.&apos;j I) 5. The economic, military and political pull which a State can exert in theworld in peacetime should be measured not so much by its total resources as bythat part of them which its Government and people are prepared to use for defence and other international purposes. Viewed in these terms, only the UnitedStates (because of her enormous resources) and the USSR (because although herresources are smaller a greater proportion of them are at the Government^ disposal)have the strength to provide and sustain a complete power apparatus. The E.E.C.countries could move into this class if they pooled their resources and set about it.No other country or group is anywhere near the required strength (though thevast populations of India and China give them political importance far beyond their industrial power). The United Kingdom, with its relatively stable population and without its former overseas empire, cannot even approach this status.6. The following table illustrates the situation described above. In eachcase the present and predicted future population figures are accompanied by thelatest figures for the two simplest indicators of economic development productionof steel and of electricity.

The United States will continue to be the backbone of Western resistance to Communism. But the Americans will become more rather than less dependentupon the rest of the free world. As their economy expands and their indigenousnatural resources diminish, their imports and so their interest in the continuedsecurity of the raw-material-producing countries will increase; though this willnot have much impact upon United States policies during the next 10 years. Even
gjjrnore important, as the world-wide struggle continues, the United States will^attach increasing importance to the containment of Russia and China both forthe sake of their own security and because, more generally, they cannot afford to appear to be losing the struggle for ideological and political mastery. It istherefore highly improbable that the United States will deliberately adopt anisolationist or &quot; Fortress America &quot; policy. Only the development of neutralistor third-force policies in Western Europe (see paragraph 10 below) might cause the Americans to withdraw their troops and lose interest in Europe, but even thenthey would maintain their interest and their influence in other parts of the world.8. As always, the United States will continue to look for allies who are strong and stout-hearted opponents of Soviet ambitions. They will also expect their allies to do more in promoting the development of backward countries. If disputesor tensions force them to choose between their allies, they are likely to throw theirweight behind the ally for whom they have most respect as an actively powerfulopponent of Russian and Chineseexpansionism,and as a large contributor to the jointaims of the free world. The continued intimacy of Anglo-American co-operation will only be possible provided that we can satisfy these conditions; in the last resort we must be ready to use our available resources in support of Americanefforts to halt a forward thrust by the Communist Powers.(B) Western Europe9. If, as is probable, Soviet policy in Europe remains fairly constant, germany is likely to remain divided and the West Germans firmly attached to the Westerncamp. But the future of Western Europe, and of NATO as a whole, dependschiefly upon two unpredictable factors the policy of France and the future ofGermany. For France there are two main possibilities. The first is that de Gaulleor his successors will decide to push ahead with the economic (and consequentlypolitical) integration of the &quot; Six&quot;. If this happens, the new world Powersuggested in paragraph 4 above will emerge, probably with its own &quot; European &quot;nuclear deterrent. On balance, we need not fear that the Six would then turn to anti-American or neutralist policies; the feelings of inferiority which produceanti-Americanism would largely die away. The emergence of this new unit might indeed in many ways serve to strengthen the free world as a whole and thus toincrease our own security. At the same time however it would pose great problems for the United Kingdom. It would probably replace us as the second member ofthe North Atlantic Alliance (a process already started by the increasing strengthof the West German army), there would be a considerable danger that other european countries would jump on to the E.E.C. band-wagon, and if an economicdivision of Western Europe led to conflict, the United States with their traditionalattachment to the idea of European unity, might even feel obliged to support the six against us, to the great detriment of Anglo-American co-operation. Much will therefore depend upon our ability and that of the Stockholm Group as a whole to reach an economic accommodation with the E.E.C. or on the readiness of the americans to come closer to Europe and work for the creation of a re-invigoratedO.E.E.C. of which they would be full members.10. Alternatively, France may prefer national isolation and the movement towards integration may fail. There are degrees of failure. It might take the lessdamaging form of a slowing-down, resulting by 1970 in a loose economicagglomeration with no real political or social unity. But it might also mean,especially if the Algerian war drags on, the real collapse of West European unity,with France adopting policies of isolation and even neutralism, and using her military nuclear capacity to bolster an illusion of self-sufficiency. Such an outcomewould relieve the United Kingdom of the problems created by a successful E.E.C.But it would be far more dangerous for NATO (even if the failure of integrationwere modified) and therefore for our own ultimate security. Not the least of the dangers then confronting us would be the possibility that the West Germans wouldexchange the failure of their West European policies for an understanding withMoscow, and that, with Germany neutralised or even hostile, the Americans wouldbe forced to leave continental Europe. In so far as &quot; Fortress America &quot; willremain a possibility over the period, it will be so because European, rather than united States, policies may bring it about, e.g., if they tend towards neutralismor disengagement. They would be more likely to tend in this direction if Europeanswere given reason to doubt the determination of the United Kingdom to maintain and contribute to the NATO Alliance.TOP SECRET
(C) The Commonwealth &apos;gm11.   Some Commonwealth members do not regard themselves as part of the^Western Camp.  But the Commonwealth may be considered in this context as anentity both of particular value to the United Kingdom and contributing generally to the stability and survival of the free world.12. The importance of its role in both respects is difficult to assess. Whilethe Commonwealth would not survive if its ties were made definite and tangible,their lack of definition makes their value largely imponderable. But the likelycourse of events over the next 10 years may illuminate the nature of theCommonwealth in the following respects:  (a) It is not and with its present and prospective membership will certainly not become a political or military unit. Indeed, as more colonial territories gain independence or internal autonomy, the formal ties both political and military will tend to become looser. Nor is there anylikelihood of a united policy in the struggle between the Sino-soviet bloc and the free world. Some new members of the commonwealth as well, naturally, as the old, are likely to remain closely aligned with theUnited Kingdom; for instance Malaya and Nigeria. But in Pakistanthere is a risk that the present regime might collapse and a period ofinstability ensue. India, Ceylon and Ghana will follow a policy ofnon-alignment. If, however, Russia and China adopt conspicuouslyaggressive policies a greater degree of Commonwealth political andeven military co-operation will be a possibility.(b) The Commonwealth is likely to become less of an economic unit. We shall probably maintain a high and increasing level of trade with members(although imperial preferences are likely to continue to dwindle), and continued preferential access to the London money market, the tie ofhealthy sterling and sizeable United Kingdom contributions to economic development would help to keep the Commonwealth together. But aBritain which is slipping backwards in relative economic power cannot expect to increase her proportion of the trade of other commonwealth countries, and the next 10 years may see a decrease in this proportion.13.   Those assets of the Commonwealth connexion which are capable ofsurviving are perhaps the following:  (a) Its continued existence can demonstrate to coloured and not least tocolonial peoples the possibility and advantage of an independent butclose relationship with white Western Powers. As the colonial characterof the Commonwealth increasingly disappears, it should be possible to achieve a more wide-spread community of sentiment and fundamentalapproach to international problems.(6) The Commonwealth will continue to provide an exceptional forum in whichadvanced and backward countries can plan economic development on abasis of equality and collaboration. This could be of real importanceif India achieves a measure of economic success and the Commonwealthconnexion is seen to have contributed to it.(c) To be prosperous, the United Kingdom must continue to be a power with world-wide economic, and so political, interests. The Commonwealthcan continue to be a useful instrument for maintaining this world-wide&quot; presence&quot;, though as it loses its colonial character, its military character will also decrease.(d) Intimate co-operation with Canada, Australia and New Zealand is likelyto continue.   The United Kingdom can expect to benefit from theeconomic expansion of these countries.(e) The combination of (a), (b) and (c) above will enhance our general politicalstanding and in particular our value as an ally in United States eyes.14.   These assets may be threatened in various ways over the next 10 years.(a) By 1970 die Commonwealth will consist of 700 million coloured and100 million white people, and the gap between their standards of livingwill have steadily widened. This fact in itself will be a danger to theCommonwealth connexion.
The Soviet Bloc(A) Russia17. Internally the drive for economic advance will probably dominate the scene. The Communist leaders will be as determined as ever to retain all the reinsof power in their own hands; but, subject to this, they will continue to seek ways and means of exercising their power in a less openly despotic manner. the gradual erosion of the Communist autocracy in the USSR is unlikely to have mademuch progress by 1970. Equally distant is the prospect of a Soviet Governmentwhich has abandoned its determination to work for a Communist world.18. Increased confidence in their economic and military nuclear capacitywill make Russian foreign policy more thrusting, but the Russian leaders willcontinue to dread global war and, provided the West makes clear its determination to resist encroachments, will probably therefore avoid pushing to the point wherethere is a serious risk of a military show-down. They will continue to cajole andcourt the under-developed countries (e.g., with economic aid) and to harry and try to disunite the West by alternating crisis and detente. A struggle for the succession to Khrushchev would not necessarily slacken this policy; it might intensify it.19. In Europe the Russians will work persistently to undermine UnitedStates influence and substitute their own. Their main object will be to get theAmerican forces out, and to this end they may offer concessions, e.g., to Germanswanting unification. But these concessions are likely to stop short of endangeringCommunism in Eastern Germany or their hold over their East European empire,and unless there is a radical shift in German policy, Germany will probably remaindivided (though it is conceivable that if the E.E.C. really begins to develop into anew world power, the Russians may be prepared to pay a higher price in orderto entice Western Germany out and so disrupt the organisation). In the rest of theworld the Russian aim will be to destroy Western advantages and influence ratherthan to set up Communist regimes, and they will probably continue to allythemselves with racial, nationalist and if necessary &quot; bourgeois&quot; movements(though if a golden opportunity arose for setting up a Communist State, theymight well take it).^ (b) Anti-colonial and racial disputes could destroy the value of theCommonwealth relationship for coloured people. There is little theUnited Kingdom can do to influence South African policy, which maylead to South Africa leaving the Commonwealth. But the crux for theUnited Kingdom will be East and Central Africa, where failure to solve the problems of multi-racial communities could strain and even destroy the Commonwealth by directly involving the United Kingdom in anirreconcilable division between white and coloured.(c) The defence and economic interests of Canada, Australia and to a lesser extent, New Zealand will involve them increasingly with the UnitedStates. If it ever came about that any or all of these three had to choose between the United Kingdom and the United States in an issue whichvitally affected their security or prosperity, they might well, albeitreluctantly, choose the latter. Aggressive Chinese expansionism wouldaccelerate such tendencies on the part of Australia and New Zealand.id) Any severe weakening of sterling or (as regards the new members) failure by the United Kingdom to provide a reasonable contribution to their economic development would have a damaging effect.(e) India is very important. If India fails to make economic progress andfalls apart or is lost to Communism, all South and South-East Asia islikely to be effectively lost to the West. If the worst comes to the worstand India leaves the Commonwealth, many of the other new members are likely to go too. If, on the other hand, India is reasonably successful,the outlook for Asia and the Commonwealth will brighten.15. Our relations with Eire will continue to be dominated by the issue of partition, but no important changes seem probable.16. To sum up, the future of the Commonwealth over the next 10 years will depend chiefly upon the course of events in India, East and Central Africa and theUnion of South Africa, and the economic strength and policies of the UnitedKingdom. If these go well, the Commonwealth can continue to contribute to themaintenance of our position and to the stability of the free world.
20. The unity of the Communist bloc will continue to be of paramount^importance to Russia. On the whole, a major crisis in the Satellites is unlikerjQpIf there is one, the Russians will successfully suppress it. Nor is it likely that any reduction of tension between East and West will lead to a weakening of the Russianhold over their Satellites. The Russians will attach great importance to maintaininggood relations with China, and will probably succeed. A split between Russiaand China, like Russian evolution towards democracy, is only likely over a longer period, though by 1970 the conditions in which a split will become possible (e.g.,reduced Chinese dependence upon Russia) may begin to emerge.(B) China21. The present regime may be expected to maintain its grip on China.Economic advance will continue fairly rapidly, though strains and misjudgmentsmay make progress spasmodic. At the end of the period China will still be a longway from great Power status in terms of economic strength, and may still to someextent be dependent upon Russian aid, but her immense population (800 million by 1970) combined with her growing industry will make her a Power to be reckoned with in global terms, especially if, as is probable, her land, sea and airpower increases. Western policies towards China during the next decade will,therefore, have to take account of her increasing strength and the probability ofits continued development after the period under review.22. Chinese foreign policy will continue to aim at the erosion of the Westernposition in South-East Asia and the Far East and the extension of their ownsphere of influence. To this end they will probably cultivate friendly relations withthe countries of the area, though they will not hesitate to show the iron fist whenthey think fit. It is improbable that they will risk an open attack on Formosa,where the United States will still support the present regime, for fear of provokinga nuclear counter-attack. But the Chinese may in general be more willing to take military risks, e.g., over the off-shore islands, and less interested in reducinginternational tension than their Russian allies. It is impossible to predict whetherthey will move against Hong Kong in the period under review, but it would be unwise to count upon its immunity.23. Their dependence on the USSR will make the Chinese anxious at least for the next few years to preserve the unity of the Communist bloc. In particular they probably wish to become a nuclear Power, and their ability to achieve any effective nuclear capability will depend upon Russian assistance. But their greateradventurousness, combined with their tendency to assert their ideologicalindependence, may give rise to growing strains in Sino-Soviet relations.The Confrontation of East and West24. It is clear from the foregoing paragraphs that the political, economic andmilitary struggle between the Sino-Soviet bloc and the Western Powers is unlikely to slacken during the next ten years. Indeed, it is likely to intensify as Russia and china increase their relative strength, and the West as a whole may have to make an even greater effort than before to hold its own.(A) Nuclear Weapons and Disarmament25. It seems probable that nuclear testing will have ceased by 1970, wxcept perhaps for small underground tests. There is little, if any, prospect of a comprehensive disarmament agreement, though there may be some progress ofa partial or minor character in particular fields. The United States and the USSRare, and will remain, the only two Powers capable of virtually obliterating eachother and therefore any other country. The probability is that the United &quot;Statesapparatus will be more complete than the Russian, but short of a technologicalbreakthrough of which even the nature cannot be foreseen, the inability of either side to provide an adequate defence against the otheris nuclear attack will mean that mutual deterrence will continue to operate; properly controlled cessation of tests would not change this position.26. It has never been the United Kingdom policy to attempt to provide a substitute for the United States strategic nuclear forces. On the other hand, theUnited Kingdom will, long before 1970, have enough, in terms of megaton warheadsalone, to inflict, by itself, considerable damage upon Russia. We shall thus haveto choose between developing by ourselves a means of delivery which would be
teffective in the circumstances of 1970, or depending heavily on American techniques.(Ko fourth or subsequent nuclear Power is likely to be able on its own by 1970 to dispose of anything approaching the nuclear power even of the United kingdom but changes in American policy might lead to the development of a NATO strategic nuclear force.27. It is difficult to predict how many other individual nuclear Powers will emerge. (In this context a nuclear Power is defined as a country with nuclear weapons whose use is not subject to an external veto.) Nothing is likely to preventFrance, either alone or with United States and United Kingdom co-operation,from developing some nuclear capacity. Other countries which could do so aloneinclude West Germany, Sweden, China, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Canada,India, Japan and just possibly the Argentine, Brazil and Israel. But in most casesthe weapons would be crude and without any effective means of delivery.28. Whether these countries will do so is another matter. An effective testsuspension agreement v/ould be a powerful deterrent (though it is quite possibleto make a crude but effective untested weapon). But if the existing nuclear Powerscan be persuaded to pass on tested designs or &quot; know-how &quot;, the suspension of tests will not prevent the emergence of at least some new nuclear Powers. It seems probable that if one side does this, the other may follow suit. Much also depends on the attitude of France. If she goes ahead with West European integration,her nuclear capacity may in effect merge into a &quot; European &quot; deterrent under jointcontrol. But if she relapses into isolation, the West Germans are likely to press for their own nuclear weapons, and Russia&apos;s allies will probably do the same.Other than France, only China of the countries listed above has indicated any clearintention of manufacturing nuclear weapons. With a determined effort Chinacould probably do so towards the middle of the decade.(B) The Uncommitted and Backward Countries29. On the assumption that there is no general war and no major russian advance in Europe, the main struggle will be for influence and power in thecountries outside Europe. They vary immensely. But certain features are almostuniversal.(a) Most of the uncommitted countries and some of our allies are waiting tosee which side wins. They will die in no last ditches. They have little or no ingrained attachment either to Marxist or, with certain exceptions(e.g., India and Israel), to Western liberal ideas.(b) Nearly all of them are in urgent need of capital for economic development and they will accept it from any quarter without regard to political&apos; alignments.   While Western generosity will probably not by itselfwin new friends for the Western camp, the lack of it may cause -additions to the ranks of our enemies.(c) The gap between the advanced countries of the West and the Soviet bloc,on the one hand, and the under-developed countries of Asia and africa on the other will widen. This is not likely to be conducive to international political stability.id) The dominant political motive will continue to be national independence,and great advantage will accrue in the next 10 years to the side whichsuccessfully represents itself as its champion. This will cut both ways.Colonial Powers which appear to be clinging to their remainingpossessions, or which fail to solve their multi-racial problems, will suffer; but if this can be avoided, the growing awareness of peoples and Governments that Sino-Soviet imperialism is the real threat totheir independence should tell on our side.(e) The trend away from parliamentary government is likely to continue.Africa30. The division between North and Tropical Africa will remain. In north africa events will chiefly depend upon the outcome of the Algerian War. If no solution emerges, there will be a risk that rabid nationalism fomented from russia will pose a grave threat to the southern flank of NATO.31. South of the Sahara, territories which are now colonies will have obtainedtheir independence, but are likely to remain separate States rather than to formcloser associations, pressure for greater unity being frustrated by local rivalries.
20. The unity of the Communist bloc will continue to be of paramount^importance to Russia.

It has never been the United Kingdom policy to attempt to provide a substitute for the United States strategic nuclear forces. On the other hand, theUnited Kingdom will, long before 1970, have enough, in terms of megaton warheadsalone, to inflict, by itself, considerable damage upon Russia. We shall thus haveto choose between developing by ourselves a means of delivery which would be
effective in the circumstances of 1970, or depending heavily on American techniques.gKo fourth or subsequent nuclear Power is likely to be able on its own by 1970 to dispose of anything approaching the nuclear power even of the United kingdom but changes in American policy might lead to the development of a NATO strategic nuclear force.27. It is difficult to predict how many other individual nuclear Powers will emerge. (In this context a nuclear Power is defined as a country with nuclear weapons whose use is not subject to an external veto.) Nothing is likely to preventFrance, either alone or with United States and United Kingdom co-operation,from developing some nuclear capacity. Other countries which could do so aloneinclude West Germany, Sweden, China, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Canada,India, Japan and just possibly the Argentine, Brazil and Israel. But in most casesthe weapons would be crude and without any effective means of delivery.28. Whether these countries will do so is another matter. An effective testsuspension agreement would be a powerful deterrent (though it is quite possibleto make a crude but effective untested weapon). But if the existing nuclear Powerscan be persuaded to pass on tested designs or &quot; know-how &quot;, the suspension of tests will not prevent the emergence of at least some new nuclear Powers. It seems probable that if one side does this, the other may follow suit. Much also depends on the attitude of France. If she goes ahead with West European integration,her nuclear capacity may in effect merge into a &quot; European &quot; deterrent under jointcontrol. But if she relapses into isolation, the West Germans are likely to press for their own nuclear weapons, and Russia&apos;s allies will probably do the same.Other than France, only China of the countries listed above has indicated any clearintention of manufacturing nuclear weapons. With a determined effort Chinacould probably do so towards the middle of the decade.(B) The Uncommitted and Backward Countries29. On the assumption that there is no general war and no major russian advance in Europe, the main struggle will be for influence and power in thecountries outside Europe. They vary immensely. But certain features are almostuniversal.(a) Most of the uncommitted countries and some of our allies are waiting tosee which side wins. They will die in no last ditches. They have little or no ingrained attachment either to Marxist or, with certain exceptions(e.g., India and Israel), to Western liberal ideas.(b) Nearly all of them arc in urgent need of capital for economic development and they will accept it from any quarter without regard to politicalalignments. While Western generosity will probably not by itselfwin new friends for the Western camp, the lack of it may cause additions to the ranks of our enemies.(c) The gap between the advanced countries of the West and the Soviet bloc,on the one hand, and the under-developed countries of Asia and africa on the other will widen. This is not likely to be conducive to international political stability.(d) The dominant political motive will continue to be national independence,and great advantage will accrue in the next 10 years to the side whichsuccessfully represents itself as its champion. This will cut both ways.Colonial Powers which appear to be clinging to their remainingpossessions, or which fail to solve their multi-racial problems, will suffer; but if this can be avoided, the growing awareness of peoples and Governments that Sino-Soviet imperialism is the real threat totheir independence should tell on our side.(e) The trend away from parliamentary government is likely to continue.Africa30. The division between North and Tropical Africa will remain. In north africa events will chiefly depend upon the outcome of the Algerian War. If no solution emerges, there will be a risk that rabid nationalism fomented from russia will pose a grave threat to the southern flank of NATO.31. South of the Sahara, territories which are now colonies will have obtainedtheir independence, but are likely to remain separate States rather than to formcloser associations, pressure for greater unity being frustrated by local rivalries.
African sentiment and (in many independent States such as Ghana and Guinea^practice are likely for the main part to be neutralist. But Nigeria with its 35 million people will be a relatively large and stable community within the Commonwealth,likely to exercise increasing influence in our favour in the rest of Africa. It is,however, early days to predict the attitude of other territories which have not yetgained independence. Much will depend on what happens in East and central africa where there is the complicating factor of the white settlers. The attainment of independence by countries elsewhere in Africa will act as a spur to Africannationalist aspirations in these areas. If we are able to effect a peaceful and satisfactory settlement there, and if we and our friends can produce enough capital to meet their needs, the uncommitted countries may well remain friendly towards us. But if we fail in these two respects they are likely to offer an easy prey to russian blandishments.The Middle East32. While political alignments in the Middle East are unpredictable, Arabunity is perhaps unlikely to progress very far or to find any lasting form. But theurge to unity is likely to remain, combined with increasing radical and nationalistpressures for social and economic reform, neutrality and independence of bothEast and West. Outside the Arab world, Iran may well opt for neutralism andso bring CENTO to an end. In this ferment, Communism has its appeal and willremain a danger. But, in the near future at least, it is likely to be kept under bynationalist, &quot; middle-class&quot;, military regimes. They will be left of centrepolitically and inclined to distrust the Western Powers, especially the UnitedKingdom, as the recent overlords of the area. But their interests are not reconcilable,with those of Russia, and this may become increasingly clear.33. The Palestine problem is unlikely to be solved and will remain apermanent source of danger to Western relations with the Arabs. Another source,more directly involving the United Kingdom, will be our position in the persian gulf, where the radicalism, which will increasingly threaten the Rulers, will threatenus also. If, as seems likely, this radicalism remains hostile and we can find no othersupport than the Rulers for our position, it will appear increasingly anachronisticand we shall be unlikely to maintain it in its present form during the next decade.South-East Asia34. The danger-points are the former Indo-Chinese States and Indonesia,which for different reasons are highly vulnerable to Communist penetration, and singapore, a key position where future stability is uncertain. It is possible thatthe United Kingdom will be able to retain bases there until 1970, but it would be unwise to base policy for the end of the period upon this assumption. In otherparts of the area the struggle seems at present likely to take the form of prolongedeconomic competition rather than of sudden political shifts. The latter cannothowever be ruled out. In particular, while most Asians are firm neutralists, theywill nevertheless watch keenly for any sign of Western weakness. Their policy ismade possible by the existing balance of power; if it alters against us, defectionswill follow rapidly.   Much will also depend oh what happens in India.35. The main forces on the Communist side will be Soviet aid and theambivalent attraction of an increasingly powerful China (although Chinese and russian policies will not necessarily be in harmony). Communist Chinese influence on the overseas Chinese communities, which are important in most of the countries of the area, will probably grow. Forces which should work in favour of theWest will be Western ability to provide capital and appear as the champions ofnational independence. In particular any resources available could exercise a valuable influence in Indonesia. The United Kingdom will be able to play a directrole in Singapore; an indirect one in the Commonwealth countries and Nepal.But for the rest, the United States will be the most important Western Power (with australia taking an increasing part) and our influence on the course of events islikely to decrease.36. The main Power of the area, at any rate towards the end of the decade,will be China. Japan&apos;s population however will reach 100 million and her economic growth will probably keep pace.  In foreign policy, she may seek before 1970 toFar East
play a more independent role, eg,, by promoting trade and some kind of workingrelationship with China, and by adopting a middle position between the two PowerW?locs. But a real rapprochement with China or Russia seems unlikely. Formosais likely, though not certain, to remain independent, with United States support.A weakening of the regime when Chiang Kai-shek goes or a modification of UnitedStates policy if Formosa loses its seat at the United Nations might change thesituation, but this is very speculative. China is likely to have gained possession ofthe Offshore Islands (without a major war) by 1970. The division of Korea andan uneasy situation there seems likely to continue. Hong Kong will constitute a danger-point where trouble might break out at any time.Latin America37. Latin America will grow in importance as a market and producer of rawmaterials, and the United States which alone can produce the necessary capital willcontinue to dominate the scene. By 1970 Brazil may have reached the stage ofpolitical and social coherence and economic development at which a country begins to become a significant military Power. There can be no assured prospect ofpolitical stability in this rapidly expanding area. Communist influence is likely to grow and the Latin Americans will become progressively less ready to follow UnitedStates policy. At the very least, they will be able and no doubt willing to exactincreasing rewards from the United States for their political support. Resentmentof United States dominance would provide the United Kingdom with theopportunity to play a part in Latin America, if we had the capital with which todo so.The United Nations38. The United Nations is likely to grow in influence and activity during thenext 10 years. In particular the smaller and backward Powers, whose ranks willbe swelled by new entrants, will, under the system of &quot; one country, one vote &quot;increasingly be able to make their weight felt in ways which might prove embarrassing for the West, e.g., on colonial matters; and &quot;world opinion&quot; (as opposed to the policy of either Power bloc) may exercise a growing but limitedpower of its own. Correspondingly the office of the Secretary-General, as the agentof &quot; world opinion &quot;, will grow in importance and the great Powers will need topay greater attention to the need to make their policies palatable in the united nations.39. Such developments will have implications for United Kingdom colonial policy and for the use of force in defence of United Kingdom interests. It may alsobe of importance in the East-West struggle where the great Powers may find it increasing convenient to use the United Nations (e.g., by machinery analogous to the U.N.E.F.) as a cushion to soften dangerous disputes. At the same timeinternational economic institutions, such as the I.M.F. and the I.B.R.D., are likely toassume larger roles in the orderly planning of economic development.40. It seems probable that Communist China will have gained admission to the United Nations by 1970, and that the United States will, in the last resort,accept the situation.Conclusions41. Since there is no reason to believe that the period 1960-70 will be anymore predictable than previous decades, any forecast will certainly be mistaken indetail and may well be so even in its whole approach. Certain elements of theabove section those relating, for instance to population changes or industrialdevelopment rest on a reasonably solid base. Other parts are more controversial and sometimes amount to little more than guesswork.42. In general it is believed that the picture of the 1960s presented in thissection one of military equilibrium in the struggle between the Sino-Soviet bloc and the West, with the under-developed countries as a main area of economic andideological conflict represents the least unlikely course of events in theinternational scene.

falsified by some major and unforeseeable disturbance. The chief and mosUdevastating of these would be global war; for reasons given in this paper we djQpnot think that this will happen. There are other possibilities which, though lessdevastating, could also radically change the whole picture and thus anyconsiderations of policy which may arise out of it. A world slump like that of the1930s, though most unlikely in actual circumstances, is theoretically possible andwould let loose large and unpredictable social and political forces throughout theworld. Similarly a limited but protracted war involving substantial forces onthe pattern of that in Korea, though perhaps equally unlikely, could radicallychange the Wesfs military and political thinking and impose significant economicstrain. A possibility which is quite unpredictable is that a major scientificbreakthrough might confer on either side a military or technological ascendancyover the other. Further, a significant political defeat for the West, caused, e.g., bythe collapse or defection of an important country in the free world, could, bydestroying the present balance of power, completely alter the basis of Western and united Kingdom policy.43. A dramatic advance in the exploration of outer space might also in someway falsify the picture. It is not possible, at the moment, to say whether knowledgeof outer space or the operation of earth satellites will substantially modify themilitary balance of power up to 1970, but there may be significant advances in thefield of communications, reconnaissance and perhaps even bombardment. Suchprogress might have civil as well as military importance.44. Changes of this kind or any such major defeat for the West are improbable.Nevertheless, there are a number of key countries which are threatened in various ways, and over a period as long as ten years it is impossible to predict with certainty that none of them will succumb. They include Germany, whose defectionto the Soviet bloc would destroy the balance of power in Europe; Turkey, whosecollapse or defection would open the Middle East to Soviet domination; Indonesia,whose conversion into a Communist State would be a major political and strategicblow to the Western position in South-East Asia; and India, whose failure toimprove living standards under a democratic system would greatly influence thepolitical and ideological attitudes of all uncommitted countries, especially if thisfailure had to be measured against the success of Communist China. These arecountries which need to be watched with special care.45. Subject to these reservations, it is believed that the picture presented in this paper provides the most reasonable basis for planning the future policy ofthe United Kingdom which can be obtained at the present day. certain conclusions seem to emerge:  (a) The struggle in all its aspects military, political, ideological and economic between the free world and the Communist bloc is likely to intensifyrather than slacken. One of the main arenas will be the under-developed countries. The West collectively may find it harder than before to contain the Russians and Chinese. It is clear that the United kingdom will need to make a substantial contribution.(b) The gap between the advanced countries of the West and the Soviet blocon the one hand, and the under-developed countries of Asia and africa on the other, will widen. The West will face increasing pressure to devote a larger proportion of its resources to helping close this gap.(c) The United Kingdom&apos;s relative power in the world will certainly decline,though it does not follow that our status need necessarily do the same.The main problems for United Kingdom policy are likely to be not somuch how to defend our interests by the use of our own resources, ashow to do so by combining with friends and allies.(d) We may therefore before 1970 face difficult choices.   As regards our own resources, there will be a danger that by spreading them too thinlyand too widely, we may fail to preserve our most important interests.As regards friends and allies, we may find that the centre of gravity of our international relationships, has to shift, to the extent that ourlinks with one cannot be greatly strengthened except at the expenseof our links with another.(e) The greatest problems in this context are posed by our relationships withthe United States, the Commonwealth and Western Europe.
mFUTURE POLICY STUDY, 1960-70PART IITHE RESOURCES OF THE UNITED kingdom. This part of the Report considers the economic resources of the UnitedKingdom, their likely development during the next decade, and the claims upon them. The size of the United kingdom&apos;s effort to further its security and itsoverseas policies will depend upon a combination of factors the world economicbackground in which the United Kingdom earns its living, the adaptability andgrowth of the national economy, the enterprise and skill with which the economy is conducted and the willingness of the people to devote their incomes to this effort.A. The Economic background. The course of developments described in Part I, which envisages a rapid growth of world population and production and income, should not be unfavourable to the United Kingdom. It should give opportunities for a continuing expansionof world trade, which is indispensable for our prosperity. But there is always a danger that the structure of international trade and payments may becomeunbalanced, forcing painful and difficult adjustments. If the swing against theUnited States persisted, and forced the United States to take drastic remedial action,this could have damaging effects for the whole free world. If the european economic Community (E.E.C.) were to develop a protectionist and aggressive trade policy, which disrupted the fabric of world-wide multilateral trade, this would docritical damage to the United Kingdom&apos;s trade and national economy. In any event, the period will be one of intensive competition in world markets and wecannot in future rely upon being able to control the rules. These are serious risks.There is increasing international awareness of them and improving international co--operation to prevent adverse conditions from developing. It is upon suchco-operation, rather than independent action, that the United Kingdom must rely.3. If the world conditions are reasonably favourable, the United kingdom should be able to take advantage of them. The national economy has recoveredwell since the war. Our industrial and technological resources are stronger and better attuned to world demand than for a very long time perhaps even since theearly years of the century. The prospects for economic growth in the next decadeprovide a fair expectation that the gross national product in 1970 will be significantly higher than in 1959. There are internal risks as well as external the United Kingdom cannot claim to have solved the problem of combining full employment and rapid economic growth with internal price stability. In orderto earn our living as a relatively smaller Power, subject to the danger that capital and skilled resources will be attracted to the greater agglomerations of economic resources, we have to show greater adaptability and readiness to change our traditional practices than in the past. It is reasonable, however, to suppose that output per worker (i.e., productivity) will continue to increase at about the same rate (2 per cent, per year) as in the post-war period.The Significance of Sterling4. Of all the major Powers, the United Kingdom has the most vulnerableeconomy, because of the weakness of the external financial position the legacyof World War II. The gold reserves are less than one-third of the sterling liabilitiesto other countries precarious backing for an international currency that by its nature must take the strain of political and financial pressures throughout the world.56587
5.   Experience in the last 10 years has shown how vulnerable sterling is a.n&amp;&amp;how damaging sterling crises are to the United Kingdom&apos;s foreign policy AND&apos;military position.  Moreover, sterling provides the currency reserves of the British,and formerly British, countries of Africa and Asia, from Freetown to Singapore,and weakness in sterling strikes directly at their financial and therefore their political stability.6. It follows that the United Kingdom&apos;s first economic responsibility, andthe necessary condition for maintaining our place in the world, is to keep sterlingstrong. This means keeping commitments within resources. If the future claims on the economy are allowed to accumulate so that the prospective increases inresources are already mortgaged in advance, there will be no margin available tomeet unforeseen needs or to cope with adverse changes in circumstances whichare bound to happen some time in a ten-year period. Such overloading, whetherit creates expenditure inside or outside the country, always hits the external financialposition sooner or later.7. Thus, in order to make the most effective economic contribution to thedefence of British interests and those of the free world, the Government muststrike a balance between the risks of doing too little, and those of doing too muchand so creating a situation in which all its purposes are frustrated and its international influence and authority undermined by a further series of sterlingcrises. This does not mean that the Government can never contemplate taking a deliberate risk: there may be occasions on which it would be more dangerous to refrain from spending than to spend. Nevertheless, we must constantly watch the state of the external financial position and the course of the balance orpayments; they are likely to forbid any ambitious expansion of overseas spendingand to limit internal spending too.B. The Burden of Support for Security and Foreign policy. The range of Government expenditures which contribute directly to thesupport of the United Kingdom&apos;s security and its overseas policies includes defence,economic aid, diplomatic expenditure, the overseas information and culturalservices, civil defence, &amp;c.  They are listed in Appendix A.9. These expenditures described subsequently as the &quot; aggregate&quot; are estimated to amount to about  1,750 millions in 1959. This is about 8^ per cent,of the gross national product at factor cost i.e., the national output of goods and services of all kinds (some  21,000 millions).10. The course of these expenditures since the end of the war is summarisedas follows (see Appendix B):    millions	1949-50	1953	1955-57	1959	average		average	Defence        .........	785	1,535	1,530	1,550Economic aid	57	57	85	131Other............	38	173	70	69&quot; Aggregate &quot;       ......	880	1,765	1,685	1,750Percentage of national product	7-7	11-8	9-3	8-4The table illustrates the rapid growth of the burden in the early 1950s, with the korean War and rearmament and stockpiling programmes (the peak was 12-3 percent, in 1952): then came the steady reduction through the period up to 1959.11. Defence expenditure itself has been fairly stable since 1953, of course ina background of rising prices and rising national product. There has been a rapid increase in economic aid ( 94 millions in 1958 and  131 millions in 1959). the category of &quot; other &quot; items was heavily swollen in the early 1950s by strategicstockpiling.12. The reduction in the burden of the aggregate in the last seven years hasfreed about 4 per cent, of the national product for other purposes, and has been one of the most important factors in the recovery and strengthening of the UnitedKingdom economy (and the lowering of tax rates).
 Comparison with our Allies13. There is great variation between the performances of our Allies. Thefollowing are the NATO figures comparing defence expenditure with gross national product in 1958 these are on a slightly different definition of defence from thatabove:  Defence expenditure in 1958	As percentage	of G.N.P.United Kingdom ...	.....        7-9United States	.....      11-2Canada     .......	.....       6-france      ......	......       8-4Germany   ...	.....       3-6  (5-5Holland     .......	.....       4-9Belgium	.....       3-6Norway	.....       4-1Denmark.......	.....       3-italy         .......	.....       4-4Australia	.....       3-0New Zealand	.....        2-3(5-5-2- per cent, in 1959)14. The United Kingdom&apos;s figure for the &quot; aggregate&quot; of Si per cent.(i.e., defence plus overseas expenditure) in 1958 may be compared with a figure ofabout 1per cent, for the United States. In recent years the United Statesproportion has been falling as fast as the United kingdom&apos;s . A country with ahigher income per head can afford to spend a larger proportion of its product onthese purposes, just as a rich man can afford to pay a larger proportion of his income in taxation than a poor man can. Given the fact that the United States&apos; income per head in real terms is 1,-2 times the United Kingdom&apos;s, the relative efforts donot seem out of line.15. The defence and aid efforts of the high-income European countries andof the old Dominions are in general manifestly inadequate in relation to the UnitedKingdom&apos;s. The French have a very large economic aid programme for their overseas territories and their &quot; aggregate &quot; is, taking into account also the cost ofthe military effort in Algeria, at present a larger part of their G.N.P. than the UnitedKingdom&apos;s. The other high-income European countries have relatively very smalldefence efforts and (except for the Belgians, who are now beginning to spendsignificant sums in the Congo) they provide little economic aid. Canada givessome economic aid under the Colombo Plan and her &quot; aggregate &quot; is probablylarger in relation to G.N.P. than any of the Europeans except France but herincome per head is much higher. Australia and New Zealand, also with much higher incomes, are right at the bottom of even the European scale.16. This disparity of burdens endangers the political health of the Alliance.It is also a limitation on the United Kingdom&apos;s (and possibly even the UnitedStates&apos;) defence and aid effort. If one advanced country sustains a proportionatelygreater effort than the others, its balance of payments is likely to suffer. It isimportant, both for the United Kingdom and for the success of the West as a whole,that a better parity of effort should be brought about, and by a process of levellingup rather than levelling down. If this is done, the collective effort of the West canbe greater than it would otherwise be. If Germany and Benelux were devoting8-j- per cent, of their G.N.Ps. to those purposes, the United Kingdom&apos;s fears of thepossible impact upon sterling of its own defence and aid effort would be muchrelieved.17. The size of the effort that the United Kingdom can make over the next decade without running risks to the balance of payments, and thus to the generalstability of the economy and to the foundations of our foreign policy, will dependconsiderably upon whether our NATO partners subject themselves to acorresponding strain.
C-Claims on the Future National Product18. Against the background described above, the following paragraphs assess the implications of the future defence and aid programmes which are discussed later, in Part III, and relate them to the prospective national product and to other claims upon it.Rate of Growth and Productivity19. It is assumed throughout that the output per worker (productivity)continues to increase, as it has done in the post-war period, at a rate of about 2 percent, per year. This would imply a growth in gross national product of about2f per cent, per year in the period to 1965 allowing for an increased working population. The prospects for the later 1960s are less clear, for the size of theworking population is affected by changes in the age of retirement, the tendenciesfor married women to go to work, the school-leaving age, &amp;c, and it is difficult to predict these rationally so far ahead. But it seems clear that the increase in theworking population will be substantially less in 1965-70 than in the previous period and that this will reduce the rate of growth in gross national product.20. The assumption of a 2 per cent, annual growth of productivity is thesoundest basis to take. It might be hoped that the economy could do better thanin the last decade, having got through the difficult post-war adjustments. But thereare potentially serious dangers within the United Kingdom economy itself notablyfailure to prevent inflation and a continued fall in the value of money. Moreover,pressure is beginning to develop for a reduction of working hours, both as normalweekly practice and in the form of longer holidays: working hours in this country are much longer than in the United States and, although much of the presentpressure is really for more overtime pay, demands for real reduction of hours arelikely to increase.21. There are international dangers too. Adverse effects would rapidly result from persistent imbalance in the United States position. The E.E.C. may notrefrain from disruptive trade policies: and even if their trade policy is reasonable,the attractions of the Common Market and the relative absence of similaropportunities in the smaller United Kingdom market, might well divert capitalfrom United Kingdom industry and slow down our rate of growth.22. The rate of growth of productivity here in the last decade has been much less than in Germany, France and Japan, to mention three instances. But bur rateof growth has not been unduly low in relation to that of advanced countries whichwere not physically disrupted by the war the United States, Belgium, Scandinavia.Moreover, the United Kingdom&apos;s worst economic &quot; war damage &quot; the change from being a great external creditor to being an external debtor was particularlydisruptive of prospects of rapid economic growth, for it enforced continuouspreoccupation with the balance of payments and repeated application of the brakeson expansion. This situation still persists, though perhaps less intensively than inthe last decade. But other countries may, in the long run, even have derivedadvantage from the wartime destruction of their capital equipment once theefforts and sacrifices of reconstruction have been borne, the new equipment is better than the old.23. Thus, although it is the objective of all Governments in this country toprovide conditions in which a higher rate of growth can be achieved, it would be unrealistic to base expectations of the future, and the commitments which theGovernment assumes for the future, on a more rapid rate of growth of productivitythan the average 2 per cent, per year.The Growth of the &quot; Aggregate &quot;24. In Appendix A are set out the Departmental figures for defence expenditure in 1965 and 1970 consistent with the lay-out of forces discussed inPart III of this Report; estimates of economic aid for 1965 on the assumption that
^his will be no greater than what is already in sight for 1960-63; and the otherJplevant items in the &quot; aggregate &quot;, such as civil defence, diplomatic expenditure,information and cultural services, &amp;c. Adjustments have been made to theDepartmental figures, on the basis set out in the Appendix, to allow, e.g., for theincrease in defence pay which would be expected to take place in this period, onthe assumption of a 2 per cent, annual growth in productivity and industrial wages,without there being any fall in the value of money.25.   The &quot; aggregate&quot; of estimated claims for 1965, in relation to theexpenditure in recent years, is:    millionsAverage1955-57 1959 1965Defence        ............     1,530 1,550 1,875Economic aid         .........         85 131 170-190Other...............        70 69                  75Aggregate&quot;    .........     1,685 1,750 2,120-2,140If programmes were adopted on these lines, the &quot; aggregate &quot; would represent anincrease of about 21 per cent, in the period up to 1965 given the assumption of2 per cent, annual growth of productivity and stable value of money.26. Experience would suggest that in the event the figures will turn out to bebigger, even if the basic assumptions proved valid. There is no room for contingencies in the estimates that have been made in the defence bill-andcontingencies invariably occur. There will almost certainly be clamantrequirements for economic aid, over and above what is already in sight and includedin these totals.27. To look forward past 1965 to 1970 is highly speculative. TheDepartments&apos; figures for defence indicate a continuing growth in the defence billafter 1965, but at a somewhat reduced rate of increase. For economic aid, thereis no reason to expect lower demands in the second half of the 1960s.28. The possibility of sustaining this growth is considered here in relationto the resources of the whole economy; but this is an over-simplification. defence and overseas claims call for particularly scarce kinds of resources:  (i) Government Money. An increase in expenditure must in the long runbe matched by increased receipts from taxes. [N.B. 6d. on thestandard rate of income tax is  125-150 millions.];(ii) Men and Material. Defence absorbs over one-quarter of our researchscientists and technologists, the energies and efforts in the Forces of550,000 (coming down eventually to about 400,000) active and capableyoung men, and many of the products of our most advanced industries;(iii) perhaps most important, the impact on overseas expenditure about one-fifth of the &quot; aggregate&quot; is direct overseas expenditure (see section D below).These special considerations must always qualify conclusions framed in terms ofnational product.29. The rate of growth of the &quot; aggregate &quot; envisaged above (about 21 per cent,from 1959 to 1965) is rather more than that of the national product which couldbe expected during the period if productivity continued to increase at 2 per cent,per year and if the value of money remained stable.30. The problem of financing these claims would be easier, of course, ifthe national product grew faster and more difficult if it grew more slowly. Butthis would not change the order of magnitude of the problem within the short period of five years, for most of any growth is always absorbed in thecorrespondingly increased needs of consumption and investment.
Other Claims on the Economy .31. From what is known already of the prospective growth of public civflexpenditure implied by existing policies, an increase of 20 per cent, from 1959 to1965 i.e., about as fast as the assumed rate for the national product is a conservative estimate. For public sector investment, which is in effect the capitalexpenditure of the Departments, local authorities and the nationalised industries,the long-term programmes suggest that (allowing some room for the inevitablecontingencies) expenditure by 1965 may have increased from the 1959 level of 1,600 millions to about  1,900 millions. This allows for expansions such as power,transport, hospitals, technical colleges which are already under way; it does not allow for such possibilities as a major new attack on the problems of roads and urban congestion.32. Departments&apos; and local authorities current expenditure is less clearlymapped ahead. The chief items are health ( 750 millions in 1959) and education( 725 millions including school meals). These are certain to grow if Ministersdecide to enact any or all of the Crowther Report, this is where the cost will fall.There are about  500 millions of other basic public services, and probably another 375 millions of general administrative costs. (Cash payments, such as agriculturalsubsidies, pensions, national assistance, are not included here these transfer payments are not made for services performed and do not represent a Governmentalcall on national resources.) About two-thirds of this current expenditure is pay.This inevitably increases as industrial wages rise: and in most of this field thenumber of people at work teachers, nurses, local authority officials, &amp;c. is rising.It is public policy to develop these services, and even without new importantdepartures of policy, expenditure is likely to rise as fast as the national product.33. It would seem likely, therefore, that the whole public sector, defence and civil, will rise as fast as the national product. The question is whether the private sector consumers&apos; expenditure and private investment, which between them takeabout three-quarters of the national product can be accommodated within thisframework. Private investment has been in a lull after a very rapid growth between1954 and 1958 there are signs of a new forward move. Private consumptionhas been growing more slowly than the national product: in the last three yearssaving has been remarkably high and, if this can be kept up, the growth of consumption will be kept in check. But there is a major area of uncertainty here;private consumption is so huge and difficult to predict and control that smallchanges can throw the economy off balance and tilt it over before there is timeto get remedial action.34. It is likely that imports will increase faster than the national product, astrade restrictions are removed. The process of liberalisation of trade is a mutualone which should open wider markets for United Kingdom exports- provided thatthey are competitive. But exports will probably have to grow faster than importsfor two reasons:  (i) The terms of trade have been very favourable in the last two years the10 per cent, fall in United Kingdom import prices compared withexport prices since spring 1957 or the mid-1950s generally has beenworth  400 millions a year to the economy: some reversal in the next five years is likely.(ii) More will be invested abroad (both Government aid and private investment); and the exports will have to rise to match this and, ifpossible, to improve the external monetary position as well.Thus the balance of payments will require more resources, proportionately andabsolutely.35. To sum up, on the assumption that productivity will rise as fast as inrecent years, public sector expenditure is likely to grow at least as fast as thenational product; the balance of payments will require to take more; and thequestion is whether private consumption and private investment will grow a littlemore slowly than the national product and thus not conflict with the other claims.If over a period of years productivity grows faster than in the last decade thisis essentially a long-term matter and movements from year to year are not relevant-the danger of conflict is less: if productivity grows more slowly, the burden ofthe public sector will be heavier.
D. The Overseas Component of the &quot; Aggregate &quot;36. The danger of pressure on sterling arises whether expenditure on the&quot; aggregate &quot; is inside or outside the country.   Direct overseas costs are:    millions	1958	1959	1960-63			averageMilitary expenditure (net of German			contribution) ...      ...      ......	183	182	200Administrative and diplomatic and sub-			prescriptions to international organisation	28	28	30Economic aid   ...      ...      ......	94	130	170-190	305	340	400-42037. This expenditure is of different kinds. Some of the Forces&apos; expenditureabroad is similar in economic effect to expenditure at home; some economic aid isoffset (as far as the balance of payments is concerned) by additional export orders.On the other hand, much of the internal defence expenditure is indirectly at theexpense of the balance of payments: the industrial resources v/ould otherwiseunquestionably be producing for export or for sale on the home market, replacingimports. The differences between overseas countries, from a currency point ofview, are tending to become narrower.38. It is difficult to lay down specific rules about this expenditure that willremain valid for the long periods of time that decisions take to work themselvesout. But the size of the overseas component of the &quot; aggregate &quot; is so large that itcannot be ignored. Any significant increase could create strong pressures on sterling.E. The Main Considerations About United Kingdom Resources39. The &quot; aggregate &quot; absorbed in 1959 about 8-  per cent, of the national product. Programmes of the scale described in Part III would absorb slightly morethan 8-1&quot; per cent, in the mid-1960s, if productivity continued to increase at aboutthe same rate as in the post-war period. The proportion required up to 1970 is not likely to grow less. Arising from this situation there are six important points to note.40. First, a country with the United Kingdom&apos;s productivity and standardof living could, if it wished, afford to devote 8i per cent, of its national product tothese purposes. Indeed, as productivity grows, and with it the standard of livingimproves, this should become slightly easier to sustain from an economic standpoint.41. Second, these purposes are in direct competition for resources with other national objectives higher standard of living through increased consumption,better social services, more leisure, lower rates of taxation. With the programmesenvisaged for the &quot; aggregate &quot;, it is unlikely that the public sector&apos;s share of thenational product would fall in the next five years unless the Government were able to modify its social and other expenditure commitments.42. Third, it would be a major change in the trend of the last few years tokeep the public sector&apos;s share stable up to 1965. Since 1953, the public sector hasshrunk from 29^ per cent, of the national product to 26^ per cent, in 1958. Thiswas brought about by a fall in the &quot; aggregate &quot; from Hi per cent, to 8  per cent.,and the reduction of public housing from 240,000 in 1953 to 140,000 in 1958. the cuts in defence and housing made room for expansion in other parts of the public sector education, nuclear power, roads and railways and left room over for an overall curtailment of the public sector&apos;s share of the national product as well.Much of the strengthening of the economy in recent years and, in particular, the reductions in rates of taxation are directly attributable to this.43. In the next five years, however, there are no declining public programmes to make room for the expanding ones. The defence and overseas claims areexpanding; public investment is expanding; education and health and public services generally are expanding. These are all good claims, and recently there hasbeen a succession of new ones, such as a greatly expanded road programme, the
Crowther Report, and so on. This does not necessarily create a critical situation^But it makes a marked change from the falling proportion of our resources takefjby the public sector and from the falling rates of taxation of the last few years.44. Fourth, if the defence and aid programmes were carried out without thenecessary moderation in private and public spending, the impact would fall on thebalance of payments and on sterling. This is invariably the consequence ofoverloading the economy with large and inflexible commitments.45. The balance of payments and sterling have to take the risks in any caseof an unfavourable change in the economic climate, or of an emergency involvingnew and unforeseen claims. Compared with 1959, there is likely to be more strain on the balance of payments, for a very rapid growth of exports will be needed (inhighly competitive world conditions) to match bigger imports and an increasingdirect overseas component of the &quot; aggregate &quot;.46. Fifth, the bigger the &quot; aggregate &quot; the greater these risks will be unless they are offset by adjustments elsewhere. A sterling crisis would inevitably leadto a cut-back in defence and aid programmes and not only the United Kingdom&apos;international position but also the stability of Asia and Africa (where the currenciesare backed by sterling) would also suffer.47. Sixth, the bigger the defence and economic aid efforts of the NATO and commonwealth partners, the better would be the United Kingdom&apos;s prospects ofbeing able to carry out its programme successfully.
W) APPENDIX ATHE  COMPOSITION  OF THE  &quot;AGGREGATE&quot;  OF  EXPENDITUREIN SUPPORT OF DEFENCE AND OVERSEAS POLICIESI. Defence ExpenditureOn the basis of forecast estimates, but without allowing for increases in defencepay, outlays for 1959 and 1960 and Departmental figures for 1965 and 1970would be:    millions1959 1960 1965 19701,550 1,630 1,735 1,8002. These figures are at the present value of money. But even if throughoutthe economy prices on the average remain stable, defence pay will rise withoutthere being any question of inflation, because defence pay can be expected torise in line with wages in industry and these can rise by the increase in productivitywithout prices rising.3. About half the total defence bill consists of the pay of those directlyengaged (forces, civil servants in defence departments, industrial workers in royal ordnance Factories and Government Research and Development Establishments).This half must be expected to rise in line with industrial wages. The other halfconsists of purchases from private industry. Part of this will benefit from thegrowth of productivity, so that its cost will remain stable even if wages rise. Butanother part, e.g., development contracts, are in effect a purchase of a certainamount of man-hours of work, and the cost of this will rise with industrial wagesalso. For the purposes of making an estimate, it is assumed that about one-thirdof these purchases (making with defence pay about two-thirds of the whole costof defence) would be affected by a rise in wages proportional to the rise in productivity.4. Assuming a 2 per cent, increase of productivity in the period 1960-65, itwould follow that the defence bill in 1965 would be about  140 millions (i.e.,12 per cent, of two-thirds of  1,735 millions) higher:  1,875 millions instead of 1,735 millions. If productivity continued to rise at the same rate until 1970, thedefence bill on a similar reckoning would be about  300 millions (i.e., 25 per cent,of two-thirds of  1,800 millions) higher:  2,100 millions instead of  1,800 millions.Allowing for non-inflationary pay increases of this kind, the figures in paragraph 1above thus become:    millions1959 1960 1965 19701,550 1,630 1,875 2,100II. Economic Aid expenditure . The following estimates show the commitments which have either been incurred already or are regarded as probable for the period 1960-63. No estimatecan be made for 1965 or later years. But it is highly probable that the long-termtrend will be upward.  millions	Average			Average	1955-57	1958	1959	1960-63(a) Government current grants				(i) Colonial development and welfare&quot;!		f 18	20	26(ii) Grants to Colonies to help budgets, f*	34	\		&amp;c.            ............J		I 20	20	13(iii) Grants to Commonwealth countries				(including grants viaI.B.R.D.)	1	6	4	7-5(iv) Grants to foreign countries (includ-				ing    United    Nations   technical				assistance and Colombo Plan)	15	7	9	14-5Total         .........	50	51	53	61

FUTURE POLICY STUDY 1960-70PART iii the MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE UNITED KINGDOMS overseas and STRATEGIC policy a. Aims and Standing of the United kingdom. The ultimate aims of any Government in the United Kingdom must alwaysremain the security of these islands from foreign domination or attack, the prosperity of the British people and the protection of our individual freedom and liberty.The following paragraphs consider how best these aims may be safeguarded overthe next 10 years, in the light of the international situation depicted in Part I andthe estimate of the United Kingdom&apos;s material resources in Part II.2.   In order to fulfil our ultimate aims we must strive (a) to play a full part in the free world&apos;s efforts to counter the growing powerof the Sino-Soviet bloc;(b) to maintain the strength of sterling and to further our trading intereststhroughout the world;(c) to preserve and strengthen the cohesion of the Commonwealth.Whether we like it or not, our interests are inextricably linked with those of thewhole free world. We cannot hope to preserve them by our own independentaction, and we are much too important a part of the free world to be able toretreat into a passive role like Sweden or Switzerland. Our duties and responsibilities will be very different in the future from what they have been inthe past, but they will be no less onerous and no less demanding of our highestefforts.3. By 1970, though our national economy will have expanded, our colonial empire will have shrunk still further. The population and economic, political andmilitary power of the United States and the Soviet Union will grow faster than theUnited Kingdom&apos;s. If the European Economic Community (E.E.C.) consolidatesitself into an effective political unit it will dwarf the United Kingdom, and theUnited Kingdom will be a small Power in comparison with the three giants theUnited States, the Soviet Union and E.E.C. (with the fourth giant, China, movingup fast).4. But despite the contraction of our former strength and resources theUnited Kingdom still has many of the responsibilities of a world Power; and our influence need not shrink in proportion to our material strength. Provided that welive up to our own highest standards, our resources will not lie in material thingsalone. Our leadership of the Commonwealth, the progressive fulfilment of our colonial responsibilities, our special relationship with the United States, our european associations, the legacy of our Imperial past, the maturity of our politicalexperience outside Europe, our national quality of rising to an emergency and ourreliability in the defence of freedom and justice: all these can continue to justifyfor the United Kingdom a leading position among the Powers and a higher placein their counsels than our material assets alone would strictly warrant.5. These intangible assets are real, however, only if the United Kingdom&apos;sperformance causes other countries to value them too. We have the capacity toplay a world-wide role only if we are willing as a nation to devote our actions and resources to this purpose. There are many desirable ways of using our resources at home, especially the improvement of our standard of living through better social services and the increasing of our wealth through productive investment. But wecannot exert influence in the world unless we devote resources sufficient,to underwrite our external responsibilities.6. Our ability to maintain the influence of the United Kingdom- will dependincreasingly upon the way in which the national effort in defence and economic aid is fitted in with those of our friends to further common objectives.   We shall
have less freedom of action to carry out exclusively national policies, and we-shall have to think increasingly in terms of the need of the free world as a wholdfrto contain Communism and to build world-wide prosperity. These tasks canfor a sustained and articulated political, military and economic effort by all the advanced countries, involving new and challenging problems of international co--ordination. The United Kingdom will have to work increasingly as a memberof alliances and groupings, and it may be our role in the 1960s to set an example in making international action of this kind effective.B. World Groups and ForcesOur Friends7. There are three main groups or Powers with whom we must work in concert if the interests of ourselves and of the Free World are to be preserved.The United States8. Our partnership with the United States is an existing source of power andis capable of still further development. It is our first interest that it should remain as close as possible. In many cases, the United States will be the only Powercapable of supporting our interests in the world outside Europe. We shall become increasingly dependent on their support, as perhaps they will on ours, and ourstatus in the world will largely depend upon their readiness to treat us as theirclosest ally. They will be the more ready to do this, if we play our full part inthe international groups to which we belong.9. But Anglo-American partnership is not a law of nature. In the past wehave had sharp differences with the Americans over the Middle East anddivergences over Colonial policy. For the moment these have been largelyresolved, but they could again become acute so long as our interests are not identicaland we have commitments not shared by the Americans. Thus in the Middle east the United Kingdom and the United States share common interests in resistingthe Communist threat and preserving oil supplies for the West, but the americans are more interested in the former than in the latter. And, although the americans are now shov/ing a much better understanding of our Colonial problems, the daymay come when our responsibilities towards the white settlers in Africa mayforce us into policies antipathetic to certain influential sections of United Statesopinion.10.   There are other points where friction might arise:  (a) Our policy towards the Soviet bloc.  At the moment we think alike, butthere is always the risk that we may shake American confidence in ourreliability as an ally by seeming to wish to push on too fast towards adetente. Conversely, it is possible that American opinion could developrapidly and that it would then be we who were acting as the brake andthey who were seeking to come to an understanding with the Russians.(b) Our policy towards China. We do not see eye to eye over China, but wehave not forced the issue and our agreement to differ has, therefore,remained amicable. But Anglo-American relations will run intotrouble if, as will probably happen during the 1960s, the United nations general Assembly insist on taking a vote on Peking&apos;s representation.We might then feel unable to support the United States if, adhering totheir present policy, they pressed us strongly to join them in opposition.(c) Our policy towards Europe.   The Americans despite fears of dollardiscrimination are attracted by the concept of a united Europe, andfor political reasons, anxious that it should be strong. They suspectthat we are hostile to this concept and their suspicions will persist until we have come to a permanent understanding with Western Europe.Europe11. Our main objective is to contribute towards the unity and strength of western Europe. We must prevent its division, with the consequent weakening of the Atlantic Alliance, and ensure that NATO has the necessary strength tomaintain its objective of keeping Western Europe secure.  Politically, we need a
The Commonwealth14. The Commonwealth is neither a military entity nor a source of millitary power comparable to America or Western Europe. But some members make small but valuable contributions to the Free World&apos;s defence alliances and it furnishesbases of the highest strategic importance. Economically, though commonwealth preference will be a wasting asset, Commonwealth countries will be important tous because of the high proportion of our trade for which they account and the network of trading and financial interests based on past associations and on sterling.15. The Commonwealth association is a very important source of political influence which buttresses our standing as a Power with world-wide interests. Itcan make a valuable contribution to the problems arising out of the relationships between advanced and backward countries and between different racial societies.But the fact that it is a conglomeration of often disparate and occasionallyincompatible elements, each with its own interests and points of view, means thatthis influence can rarely be applied directly with any precision. Indeed, politicallyit can sometimes be more of an embarrassment than an asset.  Nevertheless, this a^trong France and must keep Western Germany firmly tied to the Alliance.^Economically we should encourage all members of the O.E.E.C. to adopt liberal andoutward-looking trade policies, and involve the United States even more in thefuture of Europe.12. In the long term the main threat to Western unity lies in the futureof Germany, and this, in its turn, will largely depend on the course of French policy.The long-term danger is of the political upset of the German regime leading to anattempt to bargain reunification against neutralism or to a resurgence of Germanmilitarism. In the short term, however, General de Gaulle&apos;s policy is the mainthreat to the unity of Western Europe. Here the West is faced by a dilemma. Astrong France capable of playing its part in NATO and providing a counter-weight to the growing strength of Germany is essential. But General de Gaulle,who alone seems able to hold France at such a pitch, himself pursues ideals ofFrench individualism and nationalism, which, if carried to their logical conclusion,would wreck the Atlantic Alliance. It can hardly be hoped that he will abandonthese ideals and for the United Kingdom there is at the moment no practicable alternative but to make the best of the situation and to try to mitigate the effects.13. It is impossible to be sure that Western Europe will continue along itspresent path towards integration. Our tactics must, therefore, be adjusted to suitthe needs of the moment. But the development of the E.E.C. will confront theUnited Kingdom with new problems:(a) we shall have to adapt ourselves to the idea of living alongside a very powerful West European group;(b) though it may be inconvenient to us in the short term, the movement towards West European unity foreshadowed in the E.E.C. is to our interest since it is the best means of guarding against Germanneutralisation and a Russo-German rapprochement, an eventualrecurrence of Franco-German enmity, a resurgence of Germanmilitarism or of Communism in Italy, and the disintegration of the atlantic Alliance;(c) it would seriously weaken our own standing in the Commonwealth and inthe Atlantic Alliance and the cohesion of the Alliance itself if we foundourselves excluded from Europe;(d) as a relatively small economic Power, we shall be increasingly vulnerable to the economic and trade policies carried out by the E.E.C., and shallrisk serious damage if we fail to establish a satisfactory association with it;(e) We cannot say v/hether we shall be able to negotiate a European agreement that would give us the advantage of such association and minimise the risks of damage. But we are most unlikely to be able to get such anagreement without difficult concessions in agriculture and horticulture;we should probably have to make concessions also in commonwealth preference (although this is now less significant to our export, tradethan it was 20 years ago, it would still raise political and economic difficulties with the Commonwealth).
unique association of independent nations undoubtedly contributes to worldg^stability.  We should lose much, both in terms of direct economic interest and ofywider political influences, if the Commonwealth association were to disintegrate.Our exclusion from Europe would probably lead to such disintegration or, at anyrate, to a weakening of our leadership.16. The Commonwealth association assumes special importance in theideological and economic struggle for influence and power in the countries outside europe, with the opportunities if offers for the propagation of our ideas and idealsand for intimate association with developing countries in Asia and Africa. It can help to keep away from Communist clutches a very large part of the world&apos;spopulation which might otherwise be more vulnerable.The Balance between Our Friends17. It will not always be easy to retain an equally close relationship withthese three different groupings. One basic rule of British policy is clear: we mustnever allow ourselves to be put in a position where we have to make a final choice between the United States and Europe. It would not be compatible with our vital interests to reject either one or the other and the very fact that the choice was neededwould mean the destruction of the Atlantic Alliance. The continued cohesion ofthat alliance, though not necessarily in its present form, is essential. We must therefore work to ensure the continuation of the United States presence in europe and the development of a wide economic and political community of interestsembracing both the United States and Western Europe. In so far as the UnitedKingdom can help to keep Western Europe steady in the alliance we shall enhanceour own standing in American eyes.18. This is the core of our policy and we must be prepared to adapt our plans and actions to it. If we can uphold it successfully, our influence on the UnitedStates will be considerable and we shall not need slavishly to follow their line,though we should always consider their susceptibilities before making policy decisions. In particular this is true where no essential interests of our own are involved: for example, it might be inconsistent with this policy for us to press forthe admission of Communist China to the United Nations if we were doing soagainst strong United States opposition. Even where essential interests are involvedwe should never ignore the American point of view. Similarly, to secure ourposition vis-a-vis Western Europe, as well as the United States, we must continueto maintain our military contribution to NATO at a level acceptable to our Allieseven if this means a disagreeable strain on our military and economic resources.And we must be prepared to adapt our traditional trading and domestic policiesif, by failing to do so, we should run a serious risk of being isolated from the restof Western Europe.19. All other alliances or groupings are to some extent subsidiary. prima facie, there is no reason why our responsibilities towards the Commonwealth shouldbe incompatible with our place in the Atlantic community. We should do all wecan to ensure that they are not and should try to guide the policies of our AtlanticAllies so that they command the support of the rest of the free world and, inparticular, carry appeal for the uncommitted countries. But if such a clash of interests should arise then we should never forget that the preservation of the atlantic Alliance is, in the last resort, the most basic of all our interests.The Rest of the Free World20. It is most probable that the East-West struggle, in one form or another,will continue over the next 10 years. It will be fought in countries which fall into one of the categories already described as our friends (India), countries boundto us by other regional pacts (CENTO and SEATO), former colonial territories which are friendly or still retain their Western affiliations (Malaya, Ghana and nigeria), and countries completely uncommitted or even tending towards hostility(Indonesia and Guinea). It includes countries whose power and riches are stillpotenial, but which may acquire stability and importance over the next 10 years(Brazil), and countries whose political frailty or poverty seem unilkely soon to be overcome (Laos). The common elements in all these countries are that they are not finally committed to Communism and that they are under-developed: that is to saythat such resources as they have are not yet properly exploited and their standard
*&quot;^f living is substantially below that of Western Europe or the United States. Werryannot hope for much positive help from these countries, but their final loss to theother side would do our cause great damage since the only v/ay, short of a globalwar, in which Communists can achieve their aims is by subverting or winning overso many of the uncommitted countries that the capacity and will to resist of theWest would be finally undermined. The struggle will not be confined solely tothis arena; pressures such as that on Berlin show that more direct assaults on theWestern position are not impossible. But provided that the cohesion of the alliance is maintained these are unlikely to be pushed too far, and howeverdangerous they may seem they should not be allowed to distract us from the essentialstruggle to prevent the rest of the world from passing over to the Communist camp.The Sino-Soviet Bloc21. We have seen from Part I that the Sino-Soviet bloc is likely to presenta more or less united front to the rest of the world and to grow rapidly in strength.Broadly speaking, they will pursue the same tactics in the under-developed countries as we shall: they will seek to win new loyalties by judiciously selected economic aid and an attractive presentation of their political system. The best way for usto compete will not necessarily be to try always to go one better, since aid isunpalatable if it appears to be given not for the sake of the recipient but with the aim of out-bidding an &quot; enemy &quot; offer. Indeed, in certain circumstances Communistaid to the under-developed countries may be of positive advantage to the free world,and, in such cases, our reaction should be limited to pointing out when it is beingangled so as to engage the recipient politically. Our own experience has shownthat to help a country and to mould its economy on one&apos;s own pattern does not guarantee its perpetual loyalty: there is no reason to believe that the Russians and chinese will always experience the contrary.22. The best, perhaps the only, hope for a peaceful end to the East-Westconflict, is that the East should mellow into a bourgeois prosperity where it willlose its urge to win the world for Communism. We have said (Part I, paragraph 17)that it is unlikely to advance far in this direction before 1970. Nevertheless, wemust do anything we can to assist the process. China has not yet evolved to apoint where anything can be done, but Russia presents greater opportunities: visits,meetings, cultural or commercial exchanges are small steps in that direction. Butfor the next decade we shall have to combat a twin challenge: aggressiveCommunist ideology and Russian and Chinese nationalism. The former can best be eroded away by exposure to another system which is shown to be equallysuccessful and more attractive. The latter can best be countered by maintaining the unity and strength of the West, and by bringing the uncommitted world to seeand fear the threat of Sino-Soviet Imperialism and to forget their suspicions of western Imperialism. It is too early to say whether it v/ill necessarily be to our advantage to try to aggravate any divergences which may one day appear betweenthe policies of China and Russia: it is conceivable that, at any given time, we might wish to see the restraining influence of Russia prevailing in Peking or, evenconversely, the more subtle and flexible policy of Russia hamstrung by Chineseintransigence. We should constantly review the position and be ready to adaptour policy if it seems desirable.23. We need not necessarily disagree with the Russians at every point. Therewill be a common interest in controlling situations which could lead to global warand, perhaps, in working for a measure of disarmament. Though we cannot admitit publicly, both sides would gain by avoiding the reunification of Germany. as suggested above there may be occasions when we should positively welcome the giving of aid by the Communists to under-developed territories. Any Soviet gambitshould be regarded with suspicion but it should also be considered on its merits and not treated as inevitably undesirable. To the Chinese, the West should bemore guarded.24. Co-existence does not mean to the Russians what it means to us and though a detente in Europe is desirable on its own merits we cannot expect it tomake our task any easier outside Europe. For the Russians, it will be no morethan a prelude to increased efforts to subvert the rest of the world. nevertheless we should welcome it, but only on our own terms, and should aim to exposeCommunist tactics if they try to impose their own concept on us.
25. In Part I it was said that a major crisis in the Satellites was unlikelyy-\We do not wish to stimulate unrest which Russia would be certain to suppress^/but should work to limit the further consolidation of Soviet domination by encouraging the development of economic independence in the Satellites and trying to improve political and cultural relations with them. At the same time, as a means of discrediting Soviet policy, we should not be inhibited from telling theuncommitted world what is happening in the Satellites.The United Nations26. The final major element in this world pattern is the United Nations. Ithas been said in Part I that the Organisation is likely to grow in power over thenext 10 years. It is unlikely to develop into an instrument either of Western orSoviet policy but will remain largely uncommitted between the two. Irritatingthough we may find its attitude on certain problems, we should remember that the communists probably find it equally unsatisfactory on other scores and that they,as well as the Americans, will have to pay increasing attention to the voice of world opinion as expressed through the United Nations and personified in theSecretary-General. We must be prepared therefore to endure and answerill-informed strictures on our colonial policy, to work patiently for a properappreciation of Communist imperialism and to encourage the Organisation toparticipate more vigorously in those fields where we feel it can do useful work[e.g., multilateral aid to the under-developed countries or the scotching of minorwars before they become dangerous).27. Our own position and influence within the United Nations will, to a largeextent, depend on our success in handling our colonial problems; on our recordin respect of the use of force; and on our attitude towards countries which are&quot; black sheep &quot; in the United Nations. If we fail to maintain a good record in these respects, we shall lose influence rapidly in the United Nations whatever other virtueswe may display.C. Contribution of the United Kingdom Particular Policies28. So much for the general picture. In the light of it, the following paragraphs suggest how the United Kingdom can develop her policies so as best to contribute to the efforts of the West as a whole, while safeguarding particularBritish interests. First there is our defence contribution in the field of strategic nuclear weapons and of NATO&apos;s military effort. Then follow some broadconsiderations suggesting the way in which our policies in other areas should be developed and co-ordinated with our friends over the next 10 years.29. Our defence policy towards the Atlantic Community must be viewed inrelation to the situation likely to develop over the next 10 years, as described inPart I. It is said there that a position of mutual nuclear deterrence betweenAmerica and the USSR will continue to operate over the next 10 years. TheSoviet leaders will avoid risking global war so this is unlikely to occur, but their aim will remain to split the Atlantic Alliance and thus leave Western Europe opento Communism.United Kingdom Strategic Nuclear Policy30. During the 1950s the United Kingdom certainly obtained great advantages from the fact of being a nuclear Power with a significant potential bothin weapons and delivery systems. Smaller than either of the two giants, we werenevertheless seen to have a stake in this field, which dominates the whole positionin the military struggle between Communism and the West. Our influencethroughout the world was enhanced, with the Russians and uncommitted countries as well as with the Americans. That, indeed, in broad terms is how things stand to-day.  What will happen over the next decade?31. It is conceivable that disarmament, in one form or another, might decide for us the problem of our future nuclear policy. But this seems improbable. InPart I it has been said that the chances of a general agreement on disarmamentare small. In planning our future weapons policy we should not forget that thepossibility still exists but should certainly in no way count upon it. Unilateralnuclear disarmament is, of course, within our power.   But, although it could be
&quot;Represented as setting a good example, any such action would be gravely damagingmeo our continued security and would undermine our standing in the atlantic alliance and in the world as a whole.32. In the absence of general or unilateral nuclear disarmament, the maindecisions to be taken are on the purpose of the United Kingdom strategic nuclear force, and the resources to be allocated to it over the next decade.33. A position of nuclear equipoise will shortly be reached between the americans and the Russians when each side can destroy the other and when no real purpose would be served by adding to the striking power of the opposingforces. This poses two important issues for the United Kingdom. First, we must decide to what extent our interests can and will be identified with those of theUnited States throughout the 1960s. Have we to guard against the possibility thatthe Americans might desert us and possibly the Atlantic Alliance as a whole, andadopt isolationist policies that would force us to &quot; go it alone &quot; in the face ofthreats that the United Kingdom, but not the United States, would regard asmortal? The chances of this happening over the next ten years are extremelyremote.34. Nevertheless, the view of one of those associated with this study is that inthe last resort the ability, and the determination, of the United Kingdom on itsown to threaten Russia is a priceless political asset which should not be thrownaway, even if it is considered that we would not in fact, on our own and withoutthe Americans, threaten to use our strategic nuclear force against the Russians inany circumstances except in the last resort against a threat of direct attack on thiscountry. On this view it cannot be taken for granted that the American attitudewill not change (vide paragraphs 7 and 10 of Part I and paragraphs 9 and 10 ofPart III), particularly if the Americans are confronted by the real probability ofa nuclear clash with Russia over Europe. It is very important that we shouldguard, not only against an American defection, but also against a Russianmiscalculation the danger that the Russians might, however misguidedly, think the Americans would not use their nuclear forces except in the event of attack onthe United States itself.35. But, apart from the minority view described above, there is complete agreement on the assumption, which is reflected throughout this Report, that(though there will no doubt be from time to time more or less serious differences of opinion between the Americans and ourselves) the fundamental solidarity ofthe Anglo-American Alliance will be maintained over the next decade, and thatwe should not think in terms of a United Kingdom strategic nuclear force designedto be capable of deterring Russia on its own.36. On this assumption our strategic nuclear forces will be associated with,and complementary to, those of the United States. The United Kingdom andthe United States together bearing in mind the position of equipoise with Russiadescribed above should therefore address themselves to the second major questionof &quot; how much is enough &quot; for the West to deter the Russians. It may never bepossible to establish what constitutes an absolute minimum. But it is significant that both the Americans and the Russians are coming to realise that it is impracticable to maintain more than a retaliatory deterrent. As weapons and delivery systems increase in number and complexity neither side will be able, bystriking first, to ensure the elimination of the other&apos;s strike forces. Therefore,each may concentrate on maintaining, and protecting from surprise attack, strikeforces sufficient to devastate the other&apos;s cities.37. Under present plans the United Kingdom will, by 1962, have developed a nuclear force sufficient in itself to inflict a measure of damage on Russia which,on the assumption so far adopted, may be deemed to be &quot; unacceptable &quot; to theRussians, i.e., 50 per cent, destruction of 44 major Russian cities. This, orwhatever else may from time to time be judged sufficient to deter the Russians,is the essential criterion for what is normally called an &quot; independent Britishnuclear deterrent &quot;. This concept does not mean that it would be necessary to design and produce the entire weapons system in the United Kingdom. Elements,other than warheads, could be purchased from the United States, provided theywere obtained on terms which gave us a measure of control over them such that,in the last resort, we could use them or not use them alone or in concert with others as we thought fit.
38. But the majority do not consider that the concept of an &quot; independer^deterrent &quot; is the right approach to the problem. They consider that we woulwnot, in fact, on our own, and without the&quot; Americans, threaten to use our strategic nuclear force against the Russians in any circumstances except in the last resort,against the threat of a direct attack on this country. We need, however, tomaintain a strategic nuclear force which is accepted by the Americans, and bythe Alliance as a whole, as a significant contribution to the Western deterrent.Without this our standing in the Alliance would suffer and we should lose a valuable means of influencing American policy in the event of a seriousdisagreement with them over the importance of a particular Communist threat.In terms of resources and effort, this concept may not necessarily lead to very different results from that of an &quot; independent deterrent&quot;. In practice, a contribution significant in American eyes must also have significance for theRussians.   Nevertheless, the distinction is important.39. The majority consider that the concept of co-operation in this, as inother fields, offers us political advantages, and may allow for greater flexibilitythan would otherwise be possible in determining what our nuclear strategiccommitments should be over the next decade. On the basis of a significant UnitedKingdom contribution, the Americans will feel that we are serious allies in the fight against Communism and that we are prepared to help them carry the burdenand share the odium that falls on nuclear Powers. Our deterrent should thereforebe, and should be seen to be, such a contribution; but it should not be so large asto prevent us from deploying adequate resources to meet our other defenceresponsibilities in co-operation with our allies. We stand to lose if, by investingexcessively in the strategic deterrent, we are unable to do what is needed andexpected of us as a Power with world-wide interests. In particular we must ensurethat a proper balance is struck between the cost of the strategic nuclear deterrentand that of providing adequate and properly equipped forces as a whole.40. Certain principles emerge which should govern the decisions to be takenabout the United Kingdom strategic nuclear deterrent during the next 10 years.These are as follows:  (a) to retain our status in the Alliance, we must make a significant effort inthe field of the strategic nuclear deterrent. (A minority view is thatthis effort must be sufficient for the United Kingdom on its own to beable to deter Russia);(b) to retain this status, it will not be enough simply to make a scientificcontribution, however outstanding. We must maintain a viable forcein being, under our ultimate control, which is sufficiently large to accomplish our political purposes;(c) we should therefore maintain, at the least, the ability to provide Britishwarheads for whatever weapons systems may be adopted; but(d) we shall have to accept that there will be periods in which our deterrentcannot be maintained at the strength which we are now about to achieveif it would mean introducing costly new weapons systems which wouldbe effective only over a limited period.The size and nature of our strategic nuclear force over the next decade should bedetermined in the light of these principles (when the difference of opinion on thefirst of them has been resolved) and of the separate technical study on weaponssystems, which was called for when this Report was first commissioned.41. Beyond this, there is a further question whether we should advance towards a common Western deterrent under some form of NATO control. If thepresent situation continues, there is a danger that Western Germany will eventuallydemand its own nuclear weapons and that there will be no chance of limiting the waste of resources involved in the present French policy. The possibility of developing a NATO deterrent and of associating Western Europe with it needsurgent study, if only because we know that the Americans are thinking seriouslyon these lines. There is, however, no certainty that the French problem could be solved by such an arrangement. For our part it might mean that we should have only the same degree of ultimate control over our contribution to the strategicdeterrent as we have over our nuclear forces based in the United Kingdom whichare assigned to NATO.
-^ 42. It will be desirable to discuss at the earliest opportunity with the^ftmericans how, in the state of nuclear equipoise, an effective deterrent shouldoe maintained, having regard to the form and size of the British contribution whichwe intend to make. Thereafter, we should be ready to discuss with the Americansthe concept of a NATO deterrent and the question how far Western Europe shouldbe associated more closely with the Anglo-United States nuclear partnership.Our Military Effort in NATO43. The fundamental purpose of NATO is political: to thwart the continuingSoviet aim of reducing Europe to Communism. But it achieves that purpose by military means and the military effort must be maintained if the Alliance is tocontinue to serve its political purpose. Moreover, our own contribution to NATOis not determined by military factors alone for we have undertaken a politicalcommitment under the revised Brussels Treaty of 1954 to retain certain forcesin Europe. For the time being our army forces in Europe are to be kept at a level of seven Brigade Groups. Our airforce contribution is a force of bombersbased partly in the United Kingdom and partly in Germany and fighter aircraft in the latter: the slow build-up of the German Air Force makes it difficult for usto reduce the fighter element as fast as we might have wished. In judging whether these forces best serve the interests of the West in their present location we mustnever forget that our Allies already consider our contribution to be too small.Any sign that British forces in Europe were about to withdraw permanently or make what our Allies would consider a significant reduction would endanger the cohesion and morale of the Alliance. This must be the prime factor in deciding the disposition of our forces. We must be ready to accept even what may seemto us to be over-insurance in Europe if the alternative might do damage to the atlantic Alliance.44. Nevertheless, we should not imagine that this will necessarily lead tothe most logical disposition of our resources in the global struggle againstCommunism. The major Communist threat may switch back to Europe but,for the moment, the emphasis is on their new activities in the under-developedareas. It is beginning to be realised by our Allies that resources employed incountering these activities are as much used for NATO as if expended in Europeitself. But the process still has far to go. To reduce our forces in Europe by8,000 men as was recently contemplated would undoubtedly release resources which could be better employed elsewhere. So would a decision to run downstocks to a level below that which NATO military commanders at present accept as a minimum. It may well be that it would be more sensible to make such decisions. We should like to see the basic strategic concept for NATO interpreted in such a manner as to minimise the present requirement to be able to continueoperations after the strategic nuclear exchange, while still retaining or evenimproving the effectiveness of the deterrent and the Shield. This means that prioritymust be given to the first phase of global war. It may be that the Americans are coming to see the need for such a reappraisal. But the choice, when it comes,must be the choice of NATO and not of the United Kingdom alone. In themeantime we must continue to provide what our Allies can be brought to accept as a reasonable contribution to the security of Western Europe and to make noreductions to our forces which they would feel to be militarily or politicallyunacceptable.Areas Outside EuropeAfrica South of the Sahara45. The general interests of the West will be to check Sino-Soviet infitration,to keep local Governments and populations on our side or, at least, benevolentlyneutral, and to promote trade and economic prosperity.46. Our own policy should be to foster the stability and freedom of theindependent countries, and to establish self-governing societies throughout africa on a basis which will ensure the maximum respect for personal liberties. in territories with multi-racial communities the immediate problem is to reduce theinter-racial tensions, since only when this has been done can there be progress to self-government or full independence.
47.   Our insistence that time is needed to allow integrated multi-racial societies^to develop in Eastern and Central Africa leads us into difficulties with impatierFAfrican nationalists.  This in turn may lead to a conflict with the general western and Commonwealth interest of ensuring that the new countries in Africa retain their Western ties, or at least, remain benevolently neutral.48. Over the next 10 years this area is going to present the West with one oftheir greatest challenges which will impinge on us with particular force becauseof the executive responsibilities which we shall still bear. The tempo of change isgathering momentum and it may not be long before we find ourselves alone withPortugal and Spain in retaining colonial territories in Africa. Pressures may wellso build up that we shall find it difficult to pursue the more orderly and lessprecipitate progress towards independence which we judge to be desirable in Eastand Central Africa.Claims on United Kingdom Resources for Defence and Aid49. Our defence responsibilities in the area will be mainly limited to theprotection of our remaining colonial responsibilities. They will generally be met by local forces, reinforced from the Strategic Reserves; but the theatre reservesbased in Kenya may be called upon, if not committed to their primary role ofreinforcement of the Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula. It is, however,conceivable that one of the recently established Commonwealth Governments inthe area could call on the United Kingdom for military support in the face of alocal threat to its territory.50. The needs of the area for economic aid will, however, be great and,because of our position as a colonial Power, many of them must be met by us.We are committed to provide Commonwealth Assistance Loans to the independent members of the Commonwealth and Exchequer Loans to dependent territories.We shall also have to finance schemes of technical assistance to Ghana and Nigeriaand to provide grants to dependent territories under the Colonial Development and welfare Acts and for other purposes. In all we are likely to have to spend at least 24 millions to  28 millions a year during the period and there is likely to be pressure to increase this figure.Middle East and North Africa51. Western interests which extend over the whole area are the containmentof Russia and the safeguarding of trade and freedom of movement. To ensurethese, peace and order must be maintained. In particular the West is anxious to preserve continued access to oil in new fields (e.g.. Libya and the Sahara) as wellas old.52. The Middle East will remain unstable. It is impossible to say how itwill develop; so many different forces are contending for power both within each country and between the various countries of the area. The United Kingdom must therefore retain as flexible a policy as possible. In general our line should be oneof economic co-operation, non-interference with inter-Arab affairs and, so far aspossible, disengagement from the Palestine problem. We should adopt a benevolentattitude towards Arab ideals and, while continuing to support our friends, shouldnot stand in the way of their co-operation with their neighbours. We should workfor fuller co-operation with our Western Allies and should try to ensure that theyfollow the same general policy as ourselves.53.   The area can conveniently be considered in two sections, lying north andsouth of the Middle East land barrier.North of the Barrier54.   North of the Barrier the United Kingdom at present has three majorcommitments (a) Membership of CENTO. Although the future of this organisation is uncertain its importance is such that we must continue actively tosupport it: without this support it would collapse.(b) Treaty Obligations to Cyprus and Libya. Our Treaty with Cyprus commitsus in partnership with Greece and Turkey to protect the independence,territorial integrity and security of the island.   Our Treaty with Libya
pledges mutual assistance in case of aggression.   It provides us with* certain base facilities in exchange for financial aid and is subject to review in 1963.(c) Moral Obligations to Jordan. We should be happy to terminate these ifwe could do so without automatically causing the collapse of theJordanian State.55. Cyprus provides a base for the support of CENTO and for operations inthe Levant. The primary purpose of our presence in Libya is to protect her fromthe U.A.R. As her oil resources develop, Libya will become more important tothe West and a more tempting target for Egyptian expansion. With the partialexception of Libya, where we have also a particular interest in staging and over-flying facilities, the burden which the United Kingdom carries North of the Barrieris in the general Western interest. Notwithstanding this, it is unlikely that our allies will accept a greater share of this burden. The Americans are as fullycommitted to CENTO as they are ever likely to be and are already contributingmuch to Jordan, though with increasing reluctance. As long as it remains in thegeneral interest that CENTO and Jordan should survive we must continue to give them adequate support though we must be careful not to be left bearing eithercommitment on our own.Military Commitments North of the Barrier56. Our principal military support of CENTO is the light bomber force,with a nuclear capability, in Cyprus. The obligations to uphold the existing regimesin Libya and Jordan are met by stationing forces in Cyprus, Libya and malta and by plans to reinforce the area with naval and air forces and units of the armystrategic reserve. These forces could also participate with the United States, if required, in maintaining the existing regime in Lebanon, or join in possibleoperations South of the Barrier, such as intervention in Kuwait. We cannot,however, be sure that we will be able to preserve our tenure of bases in the areaover the next 10 years.57. If called upon to honour any of our obligations in the area we could ingeneral expect the support of the United States, although in the case of jordan and Libya their active participation might be limited. Indirectly the presenceof United Kingdom land forces in the area and the knowledge that they can be quickly reinforced will continue to be an important factor in strengthening the will of the regional members of CENTO and the Levant countries to stand up to russian or other threats.58. The requirement to be able to intervene on the general scale at present planned is likely to remain though the likelihood of our being called on to intervene in the Lebanon is small and it is doubtful whether we would wish to interveneagain in Jordan to protect the regime.South of the Barrier59. South of the Barrier our interests in the Persian Gulf States and Aden arepredominantly our own, but have implications for the general Western position inthe area. Both the United Kingdom and Western Europe are dependent uponsupplies of Middle East oil, and the general Western interest would suffer if apolitical vacuum in the Persian Gulf area increased the chaos of the Arab world and made Russian penetration easier. To the extent that our position in thePersian Gulf area safeguards the supply of oil and preserves the political status quo,we are serving a general interest. In addition there is a particular United Kingdominterest at stake the profits made by the United Kingdom oil companies fromtheir operations in the area. American companies draw even larger profits fromthe area but nevertheless probably only the fear of Communist domination of thearea would impel the United States into action.60. The proportion of the total Western European oil requirements whichthe Middle East now meets will probably be reduced over the next 10 years as new sources of oil develop (e.g., Libya and the Sahara). But it seems certain that the overall tonnage which the West draws each year from the Middle East will increase
and that consequently Western dependence on the area, at the best, will not^^diminish.   The French, however, seem confident that long before the end of thefprdecade they will be able to meet all the requirements of Metropolitan Francefrom the resources of the Sahara.  If they prove right, it will obviously affect theirattitude in case of a crisis in the Persian Gulf.61. At present the United Kingdom is committed to the protection of the ruler of Kuwait and other Persian Gulf Sheikhs. It is quite certain that if we withdrew this protection or showed our intention of so doing, the local rulerswould hasten to make the best terms they could with their larger neighbours. Itwould be wrong to abandon them without making adequate provision for their protection (the Americans could certainly not take over the commitment) andto do so would endanger our wider interest outlined above. However, any alliedsupport for our intervention in the area would be unlikely except in the improbableevent of the Arab countries combining to cut off the supply of oil. If it were not thought feasible to intervene in Iraq or Iran we could in any case only protect apart of the supplies of the Middle East oil and of our profits from them (annualprofits from Kuwait amount to  45 millions out of a total of about  100 millions for all Middle East oil). The presence of our forces however also protects otherpotentially oil-rich areas (especially Abu Dhabi.)62. These commitments have disadvantages in themselves. For one thingour position in the Persian Gulf is an obstacle to good relations with the rest ofthe Arab world, and, to a lesser extent, with Iran. For another the need to retainsupporting military facilities may become a serious obstacle to the working out ofour Colonial policies in Aden and possibly also in Kenya.63. While we have at present no alternative to maintaining our politicalobligations to the Persian Gulf Rulers, and particularly to the Ruler of Kuwait, itshould be the object of our policy over the next ten years to create a situation inwhich they can be terminated without undue damage to the security of our oil supplies and the general political stability of the area. In view of the large american interests in the area we should try to engage them further in its defence. In themeantime, to prevent revolutionary pressures from building up, we should continueto encourage the Persian Gulf rulers to modernise their regimes.Military Commitments South of the Barrier64. The most important military commitment in this area is the requirement to intervene at very short notice to ensure the security of Kuwait, particularly againstIraqi attack. There are minor commitments to help other Sheikhdoms of thePersian Gulf and to support the local forces in the Somaliland Protectorate, but these are covered by the ability to meet the major tasks.65. To meet these tasks, naval, land and air forces are stationed in the persian gulf and Aden with theatre reserves in Kenya. If not required at the time in thePersian Gulf or Aden, the latter are of course available for use in East or central africa or possibly in the Sudan.66. As long as a requirement remains to intervene at the Head of the persian gulf (as for the protection of Kuwait) with the force and at the speed at present planned, no reduction can be expected in the United Kingdom&apos;s defence effort inthe area. If this requirement were removed but the United Kingdom still retainedcertain military commitments in the area, Aden would remain an essential base andsome small force would probably have to be retained in the Persian Gulf thoughthe need to station land and air forces permanently in Kenya would be less.67. If we could no longer base forces in Kenya, we should have to reconsiderour methods and if Aden also were no longer available, a fundamental revision ofmilitary policy in the area would be needed.  The alternatives would be:  (a) To run the risk that, if operations in the Persian Gulf became necessary,overflying by one or more of the various routes to it would be possible.This would be laying ourselves open to political blackmail either by thecountries of the Middle East themselves or by those of Africa and alsoexposing ourselves to trouble in the United Nations.
(/&apos;) To preserve the means to intervene at short notice in the Persian Gulf by- the permanent maintenance of a balanced seaborne force, an adequatev&apos; proportion of which was constantly within an acceptable sailing time from the Head of the Persian Gulf. As long as Singapore were available it could be based there. The possible development of Addu Atoll as an advance base for a seaborne force is mentioned in paragraph 85 below.(c) To abandon the policy of relying in the last resort on military force toprotect Kuwait and the Persian Gulf oil States.Middle East Claims on United Kingdom ResourcesMilitary68. If the function of the United Kingdom forces in the Middle East is limitedto the tasks set out above, the forces required are not great. To meet the maximumcommitment we are not likely to need reinforcements of more than a total of twobrigade groups, and the duration of any intensive fighting, if it occurs at all, is likelyto be weeks rather than months. If, however, on our own or in association withallies, we are to be prepared to intervene in a country in order to prevent it goingCommunist or to invade it because it had taken some action very harmful to theUnited Kingdom the commitment could be very large. We should have to beprepared not only to overcome the armed opposition of the country itself, but alsoto remain there, holding it clown by force, until a Government which could preserveitself on its own had been established.69.   If our defence effort is to be kept within bounds, we believe that we mustbe prepared to forgo the possibility of engaging in operations of this last kind.With the exception of those and possibly intervention in the Levant, we believethat the United Kingdom should, though trying to reduce her commitments, beprepared to discharge the tasks which she does to-day in the Middle East onapproximately the same scale throughout the period. However desirable it may beto associate allies with us in any action we may take, it is extremely unlikely thatany of them either would or could station land or air forces in the area permanently.Tt is probable that apart from countries in the area itself (e.g., Turkey, Pakistan) onlythe United States will either wish or be able to provide forces to meet specificemergencies. Even in the case of the United Stales there will be both political and practical difficulties in deploying forces quickly, certainly south of the air/seabarrier. We should retain our capacity to intervene alone for the protection of Kuwait (and, conceivably, of other Persian Gulf sheikhdoms) but should not plan on the assumption that we might engage alone in a war with any country in this area on a scale beyond that required for this.Economic70. We have at present certain financial commitments towards the middle east, for example, grants to Jordan ( 2-5 millions per annum) and Libya( 3-25 millions per annum), technical assistance to CENTO ( 0-85 millions perannum) and aid to the Palestinian refugees (about  2 millions per annum). these have been made for special reasons and could lapse after a time, either because theywere no longer needed in the United Kingdom interest or if another Western power could be induced to take them on. The total, however, will probably remain fairlyconstant at about  10 to  12 millions per annum. Indirectly, the need to give aid to the area is somewhat diminished by the huge investments of the oil companies inthe oil-producing countries.Asia and the Far East71. General interests of the West will be similar to those in the Middle East,that is to say the containment of the Communist bloc and the preservation ofnon-Communist societies, especially in India, trade and freedom of movement,and the maintenance of sufficient peace and order to safeguard both these objectives.Our hope of achieving these objectives depends upon our successful containmentof Communist China. It follows from the picture drawn of China&apos;s progress inPart I that we cannot hope to arrive at a general settlement with China.   We must,
and that consequently Western dependence on the area, at the best, will not^.diminish.

General interests of the West will be similar to those in the Middle East,that is to say the containment of the Communist bloc and the preservation ofnon-Communist societies, especially in India, trade and freedom of movement,and the maintenance of sufficient peace and order to safeguard both these objectives.Our hope of achieving these objectives depends upon our successful containmentof Communist China. It follows from the picture drawn of China&apos;s progress inPart I that we cannot hope to arrive at a general settlement with China.  We must,

however, continue to  live with her  and, to that end, should  try  to reach&apos;accommodation with her on any points on which this might be possible.   We must%jbe reasonable but firm, realistic but not provocative.72. This whole area is one in which the responsibilities and commitments of the United Kingdom are largely inherited from our imperial past. Australiaand New Zealand benefit more directly than we do from our defence expenditurein the area and they should contribute more. Australia^ interests in Asia aregrowing but she has not yet assumed commensurate responsibilities. She ispotentially capable of doing much more to keep the area stable and to retainit in the Free World, as, for instance, in Indonesia, the importance of which hasbeen emphasised in Part I. But, if we are to be realistic we must recognise thatit will be difficult to persuade the Australians or even the Americans to do more.Though we must increasingly try to get our Allies to think in terms of inter-dependence in (his area, it seems unlikely that we shall be able to make substantial economies in our own expenditure without abandoning our major interests orundertaking a radical revision of the means by which we protect them. Even so,we should not plan on the assumption that we may have to engage by ourselves in any military action (except conceivably in Hong Kong) but should maintainno greater an effort than is necessary to encourage our Allies, maintain the cohesionof the Commonwealth and make the United States fee! both that we are taking a fair share and that we have a right to be consulted on policy in the area.I73.   In the area of China and Japan, Western power and interests will be;predominantly those of the United States.   This predominance is already more marked here than in the rest of Asia, Africa and the Middle East.   But it will be worth our while to make a contribution (e.g., by maintaining our position in Peking)if only to have a chance of influencing American policy.74. Japan&apos;s strength and influence are both growing but her loyalty to theWest is not fully assured for the whole decade. The combination of her technicalability with Chinese manpower would face us with a very serious threat. her present dependence on America is unpleasant for her to swallow and it will be increasingly necessary for other Western Powers to play their part in binding Japanmore closely to the Western world. In her commercial, diplomatic and culturalpolicy the United Kingdom should do more to this end.75.   The United Kingdom has two particular interests of her own in thearea:  (a)&apos;Short of that, our position is vulnerable to subversion and, on that account, a garrison of eight units is needed there. Without the leased territories the Colony is not viable:the lease expires in 1997 and we cannot hope to negotiate anextension of it. Nor is there any prospect of our being able totransfer sovereignty to an independent Hong Kong, or fit it into anyeventual solution for Formosa. We might in due course consider making a public declaration to the effect that we would stay until 1997and then withdraw altogether. But, in the foreseeable future, such adeclaration would be unwise. We should not even prepare for any new move because this would destroy the confidence on which ourpresent position rests and might prejudice the outcome of any joint anglo-United States review of Western policy in the Far East. Ourposition in Hong Kong may be expected to give us some influence overthe Americans when they are ready to reconsider their policy towardsCommunist China and Formosa. Meanwhile, we have no choice butto remain in Hong Kong and should, without provoking the Chinese,show that we intend to do so.(b) Our colonial territories in the South-West Pacific cost us about  1 million a year for little economic return.   Strategically, their value is greater^ j,    for Auslralia^han for us.   In View of our moral responsibilities it may:.- v - ke difficult to divest ourselves of this burden. We should, however, do all we can to involve Australia and New Zealand in this area though,in the end, the people of the territories concerned will have to decidetheir own future.

w-gxea.76. /n South-East Asia and the Indian sub-continent American predominanceis less marked. Their interest in containing Communism in this area is likely toincrease but it is by no means certain that they will make available resources in proportion. The United Kingdom, by virtue of its imperial history and commonwealth position, plays a role here which cannot be discarded within thenext ten years. We shall have to continue to make a significant contribution, butwe must look for opportunities to reduce the present size of our defence effort in this area. The pace of any change will be limited by the United Kingdominterest in the cohesion and. development of the Commonwealth and the need toretain some influence over United States policy in the area. We must maintain and develop existing Western, British and Commonwealth connexions andrelations with the countries of South-East Asia, especially through economic co-operation, and should encourage the countries of the area themselves to engage in regional economic and defence co-operation. In our relationship with theindividual Governments we should not be unduly concerned if they find&quot; undemocratic &quot; solutions to their constitutional problems, or prefer to preservetheir independence by following neutralist policies. We should, however, alwaysencourage the sort of social reform which will remove the root causes of discontentand instability.77. Our economic aid effort in South-East Asia will principally be devotedto Malaya, where grants and loans are likely to average  7 millions per annum.In addition about  -5 million is set aside annually for expenditure in foreigncountries under the Colombo Plan. Defence questions in Asia generally are discussed in paragraphs 80-86 below.78. In the Indian sub-continent more than in any other area the provisionof economic aid to under-developed territories will prove a heavy burden for us.Indian needs, in particular, are enormous. The Indians are thinking of a Plancosting some  7,500 millions, which would involve a foreign exchange deficit ofsome  1,875 millions, all of which would need to be met out of foreign assistance.On the present pattern of lending we should have to provide  385 millions of this,or  75 millions per annum if India&apos;s needs were to be met in full.79. This is too large a proportion of the total amount which we can make available for economic aid. For the period 1960-63 it is calculated that ouraverage annual contribution may have to be between  35 millions and  55 millions.Pressure for it to reach the higher figure will be great. This would account forbetween a third and a quarter of all our economic aid. The question whetherthe United Kingdom should devote so large a sum to India is difficult. There are other, smaller countries to which a small proportion of this sum would mean a real economic advance and a real promise of political stability. But the considerations of the importance of India, outlined in Part I of this study, leadclearly to the conclusion that this is a sector on which the West as a whole should concentrate over the next decade, and in which the United Kingdom should play a large part, though not to the exclusion of ail other claims. As far as the restof the sub-continent is concerned, Pakistan may need  5 millions per annum and ceylon up to  3 millions.80. We have a special interest in Nepal because the Gurkha troops whichwe recruit there are indispensable to our defence policy in the Far East. At themoment at any rate India seems disposed not to interfere with this recruitmentbut there is a very real threat to the stability of the country through increasingChinese Communist pressure and subversion. The Nepalese will look to us for part at least of their economic needs and there may be strong arguments forgiving aid more substantial than the  -5 million which we plan to spend thereover the next five years. We should work closely in co-operation with the americans and, if possible, the Indians.Claims on United Kingdom Resources for Defence in Asia Generally81. United Kingdom forces in the Far East are mostly based in singapore and Malaya. Our only firm commitment apart from the security of Hong Kong,North Borneo, Sarawak, Brunei and Singapore itself, is to defend the ANZAM
area, which in effect means the defence of Malaya and Singapore. We have toldAustralia and New Zealand that we would provide a division for this purposeif necessary. However, direct attack on Malaya, Singapore, Australia or NewZealand seems a remote possibility and in practice the principal function of theFar East forces is to be available to support SEATO. No firm commitment of force has been made, but present plans do not envisage committing more thanthe Commonwealth Brigade Group and one Gurkha Brigade Group with appropriate naval and air support. Even to support one brigade group on the mainland of South-East Asia for any length of time a considerable number of reinforcements would be required from the United Kingdom.82. Unless we are to devote a considerably greater effort than we do nowto the Far East (which could only be at the expense of other areas) we cannotdeploy more than a very small force on the mainland of South-East Asia without previous reinforcement from the United Kingdom. Furthermore the potentialstrength of China in conventional forces is such that, if she were engaged, wewould be in danger of losing all that we had committed. The larger the forcewe planned to commit the longer would be the delay before we could take thefield. However large the force, there is little prospect of it being able to achievemuch against the size of force which China can deploy on the mainland.83. With these factors in mind and considering that the direct interest ofthe United Kingdom in the area is nothing like as great in proportion as is thatof Australia and New Zealand (who only devote respectively 3 and 2-3 per cent,of their gross national products to defence), it would seem unwise for the UnitedKingdom to become involved in any defence effort in the area greater than thatwhich she now assumes. In any case our whole defence effort in the area nowdepends on our having Gurkha manpower and the base of Singapore at our disposal.   Neither is assured us for the next 10 years.84. A very considerable problem would arise if we could not rely on Gurkhatroops either to support ANZAM or SEATO or for the security of singapore and Hong Kong. Australia and New Zealand, with the manpower which theycould raise by voluntary recruiting, would not be able to find sufficient land forces to act as replacements and the maintenance of land forces in Singapore and hong Kong would only be possible if troops were withdrawn from other partsof the world.85. Even with free use of Gurkha troops the need to be able to ensure theinternal security of Singapore for the purpose of using it as a base for all three services ties up a large proportion of the manpower of the Far East Land Forces.There is a danger that in future the effort involved in maintaining our position in singapore may be out of proportion to our interests in doing so particularly if political developments in Singapore or Malaya were to lead to serious restrictionson the full use of the base facilities. Before the end of the decade we may have toabandon it as a base.86. If this happens no substitute would be entirely satisfactory. To create a major new United Kingdom base in Australia would be enormously expensive and,anyway, it might be too far away. We might be able to maintain some defence effort in the Far East by co-operating with the United States and the Commonwealth,developing facilities in Australia and making greater use of Borneo. Such dispersionwould reduce our dependence on Singapore but might still leave a military andpolitical vacuum which the Americans and Australians would not be able to fill.The development of a forward naval operating base at Addu Atoll in addition tothe existing airfield at Gan would go some way towards redeeming our military position.87. It seems clear that it is in our interest (and in that of the West as a whole)to stay in Singapore for as long as possible. If, however, it were desired for any reason to disperse some of our forces now in Singapore to Borneo or Australia, thisshould be done gradually since the employment that these forces give in Singaporeis an important reason for our being not unwelcome there. In general we should develop close consultation with the Americans and Australians and discuss withthem the form which the Western political and military presence in South andSouth-East Asia should take. But in doing so, we should make clear the radicaldifference which the denial of facilities in Singapore would make to the Westernposition in the area as a whole, unless our friends and allies can find a viable
^alternative. If Singapore were lost altogether to us as a result of Communist(^yxpansion throughout South-East Asia, including Malaya, the political consequencesin the area would be such that our whole position in the Far East should bere considered.Latin America88. Over the next ten years this area is going to grow more important. its population is increasing rapidly and its economic possibilities are enormous.Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Chile are already rapidly expanding industrially--Brazil in particular may become a great Power with influence even outside thesub-continent.89. Since the war all the general interests of the West have been safeguarded by the United States. But their influence is waning and may continue to do so.The Latin American States are in fact beginning to formulate international policies of their own. A new explosive form of radical nationalism has appeared in Cubawhich may well influence policies of other Governments and possibly cause furtherrevolutions. At the moment Cuba provides the only immediate opportunity in thewhole area for serious Communist penetration. Nevertheless Communist influenceis already an important factor in many countries and is likely to spread. For allthese reasons there is a danger that Cuba&apos;s neutralist anti-American example maybe followed by some other Latin American States.90. The growing economic strength of the countries of Western Europe willenable them to provide a larger proportion than hitherto of the credits and capitalso urgently needed by Latin American countries. Western European countries can expect to increase both their political influence and their trade in Latin America.This trend may be crucial in the stable development of the area and the UnitedKingdom must play its part. So far as we are concerned the chief obstacle to increased investment and exports to Latin America is the continued, thoughdiminishing, tendency of manufacturers to ignore the area altogether or to regard it still as of only marginal importance.91. We have a few minor commitments (e.g., British Honduras and british guiana) which involve no essential national interest, yield no significant economicbenefit and tend to act as an irritant in our relations with the Latin Americanneighbours. The United Kingdom would gain if these territories could be broughtinto the West Indian Federation and if Canada could take some responsibility forthe economic development of the territories of which it is composed.The Ideological Struggle92. These areas have been discussed mainly in terms of defence and economic aid. But we must not forget the complementary services in the political field. TheWest believes that its system of government is more benevolent, more consonantwith human liberty and dignity and, in the long run, more successful than theCommunist alternative. But these beliefs and principles will not commendthemselves automatically. By information, cultural and educational work we mustcreate an infrastructure of political and spiritual sympathies without which bureconomic and military effort cannot be fully effective.
FUTURE POLICY STUDY 1960-70PART IVCONCLUSIONS AND recommendations. The international setting, the status and resources of the United Kingdom,our main objectives overseas and the broad principles of our defence policy have all been considered. The purpose of this final part of the report is to draw themost important conclusions and to formulate the general principles which should govern our policies.2. From Part I of the Report emerges a picture of military equilibriumbetween the Sino-Soviet bloc and the West, with the under-developed countriesproviding the main areas of economic and ideological conflict. This struggle willintensify. The economic gap between the advanced and the under-developed countries will widen, bringing with it serious political tension: The main effort of the West will have to be devoted to containing the growfafe of the Communistbloc. This will call for a sustained and co-ordinated political, military and economiceffort.3. The relative strength of the United Kingdom will decline during the next decade. The economic power of the United States and the Soviet Union is likelyto grow faster than ours, for their populations are growing as well as their production per head, while our population will be more or less static. To theextent that the countries of the European Economic Community succeed in combining their resources, they will represent another great centre of economicpower. China will be developing its economic strength, but its production per headwill still be low.4. The essential condition for the success of the United Kingdom&apos;s defence and foreign policy is the maintenance of a strong economy and a sound basis forsterling. Our economy is vulnerable, as the experience of the last decade hasshown, and to keep it strong we shall need active and continuing leadership inorder to contain the nation&apos;s demands private and public, defence and civil within the capacity of the national resources.5. The United Kingdom is now devoting about 8^- per cent, of its gross national product to the support of its defence and foreign policy. If we continueto do this, and if the social and other public expenditure programmes go onexpanding, the public sector will continue to absorb at least its present share of thenational product. In the last six years, this share has been steadily falling, andthis has permitted reductions in rates of taxation. There is a conflict of objectiveshere: if both defence and civil spending maintain their shares of the growingnational product, it cannot be expected that there will be room for lower rates oftaxation.6. Against this background we must make what is seen to be a significant contribution to countering the growing power of the Sino-Soviet bloc. Even thoughour reduced material strength will mean that we must work mainly in combination with our friends and allies, we shall still have an important role to play. Byexerting the strongest influence we can over our allies we can, in concert with them,maintain a better status than we can hope to have on our own. The problem willbe to maintain, and improve, the effectiveness of the main groups in which weparticipate, especially the Atlantic Community and the Commonwealth. Thereare important British interests to be sustained throughout the world, but we mayhave to be more ready to subordinate them to the general interests of the Westin order to carry our friends and allies with us.The United Kingdom&apos;s Foreign Policy7. Our material contribution to the Western effort will consist of two main elements defence and overseas aid but its value will depend largely on our external policies.   Therefore, in considering the broad conclusions which stem
from the earlier parts of the paper, account should be taken of the following principles which it is suggested should govern our foreign policy over the next decade.8. The core of our foreign policy is and must remain the Atlantic Alliance.Whatever happens, we must not find ourselves in the position of having to makea final choice between the two sides of the Atlantic. For this, it is essential thatthe American presence in Europe be maintained. We must continue and develop the Anglo-American alliance, but must never allow ourselves to be excluded from europe. These twin objectives may face us with disagreeable political and economicdecisions, as, for example, over Communist China or our agricultural policy: wemust be prepared to take these in the interests of our basic requirements.9. The value, and the problems, of the Commonwealth association have been described in paragraphs 14-19 of Part III. The Commonwealth can continue tohelp us in applying our policies in the rest of the world. But these advantages willdiminish unless we make a conscious effort to maintain them. It may not always be easy to maintain the balance between the claims of the Commonwealth and ofthe Atlantic Alliance.10. In the New Common wealth countries, and in the rest of the free worldour policies should be governed by the overriding importance of countering the threat from the Communist world. In Africa, the task will be made more difficult by the problem of multi-racial relationships; in the Middle East, by thesusceptibilities of Arab nationalism. In South-East Asia and the Far East therewill be the most direct danger from the power and attractions of Soviet and ChineseCommunism. But in all these areas alike we must foster the stability and freedomof the independent countries, and disengage so far as possible from their internalpolitics and from dissensions between them. While not concerning ourselvesunduly if the individual countries find &quot; undemocratic&quot; solutions to their constitutional problems, we should always encourage the sort of social reformwhich will remove the root causes of discontent and instability. We should not press them unduly to declare themselves as our allies: in many cases benevolentneutrality may be the best v/e can hope for.11. As for the Communist world, we must distinguish between aggressiveCommunist ideology and Russian and Chinese nationalism. The former can best be eroded away by exposure to another system which is shown to be equallysuccessful and more attractive: the latter must be met by the unity and strengthof the West. We should welcome a detente in Europe, but we must guard against it potentially disruptive influence. We must not imagine that it will make our task easier in the rest of the world. We must not let it inhibit us from doing whatlittle we can to limit the further consolidation of Russia&apos;s domination of herSatellites in Europe or from telling the uncommitted world what is happeningin Eastern Europe.The United Kingdom&apos;s Contribution12. As our part of the Western effort to limit the power of the Sino-soviet bloc we must deploy our limited resources as efficiently as we can while at the sametime exerting the greatest possible influence on our allies. It will not always be easy to reconcile these two requirements. Some of the problems involved are discussed in paragraphs 13-28 below.Conclusions on Defence13.   The main defence commitments of the United Kingdom at present are :  (i) A strategic nuclear striking force and its defence.(ii) A contribution to NATO forces.(iii) A military presence in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf and South-east asia; and a capability for reinforcement.(iv) A number of small garrison commitments.If all these commitments, and the plans for the Service Departments to meet them,remain unchanged they will entail a Defence Budget rising from a little over 1,600 millions in 1960-61 to about  1,800 millions in 1970 (calculated on present prices and rates of pay).
14. Within the total of the Defence Budget, expenditure overseas cannot be assessed in figures comparable to those given for overseas economic aid, becausethe forces and their equipment are to a large extent mobile and can be sent whereneeded from the central strategic reserve or transferred from one role or theatreto another. For example, the cost of the deterrent and air defence in the UnitedKingdom is at present about 20 per cent, of the total defence budget; but thistakes no account of the fact that both the bombers and the fighters can also be usedfor limited war operations in overseas theatres. In most cases it is not possibleto identify costs with particular roles performed by the Services in one area or another.15. Within the total defence programme over the next ten years there willbe problems of priority and choices to be made in the allocation of limited resources in terms of money, manpower and scientific ettort. The present study does notaim to consider in detail what should be the size or nature of particular elements.But three general principles emerge:  (a) First, and most important, British influence in the Atlantic community and the cohesion of the Alliance as a whole will gain if the UnitedKingdom continues to make a significant contribution both towardsthe Western strategic deterrent and towards the Shield Forces of nato.(b) Secondly, forces will still be needed to safeguard the most important ofthe British and Western interests outside Europe. There is notnecessarily a conflict between these two principles; the existence of ournuclear deterrent force is a significant factor in the maintenance of ourworld-wide military position. But we must ensure that a properbalance is struck between the cost of the strategic nuclear deterrent andthat of providing adequate and properly equipped forces as a whole.(c) Thirdly, the cost of introducing complex and expensive new weaponssystems should not generally be accepted, in any role, if they will onlybe effective for a limited period. Long-term planning should take intoaccount not only the requirements of the next decade but also theresources (e.g., in scientific effort) required for research and developmentinto weapons and delivery systems likely to be needed after 1970.16.   The following points are of special importance: (a) The Strategic Nuclear Deterrent. Our purpose should be to maintain a strategic nuclear force which is accepted by the Americans, and by the alliance as a whole, as a significant contribution to the Westerndeterrent. Without this, our standing in the Alliance would sufferand we should lose a valuable means of influencing American policyin the event of serious disagreement with them over the importance ofa particular Communist threat. This would not mean (except in theview of one of those associated with this study) that we were aiming toprovide a force capable by itself of deterring Russia. Nevertheless, a united Kingdom contribution, significant in American eyes, would also have significance for the Russians.The size and shape of our strategic nuclear deterrent during thenext decade should be determined on the following principles:  (i) To retain our status in the Alliance, we must make a significanteffort in the field of the strategic nuclear deterrent.(ii) To retain this status, it will not be enough simply to make ascientific contribution, however outstanding. We must maintain a viable force in being, under our ultimate control, which is sufficiently large to accomplish our political purposes.(iii) We should therefore maintain, at the least, the ability to provideBritish warheads for whatever weapons systems may be adopted ;but(iv) We can accept that there may be periods during which our deterrentwill not be maintained at the strength which we are now about to achieve if that strength could only be maintained by introducing costly new weapons systems which would be effectiveonly for a limited period.
We should, as soon as possible, discuss with the Americans how,in the state of nuclear equipoise, an effective deterrent should bemaintained, having regard to the form and size of the british contribution which we intend to make. Thereafter, we should beready to discuss with them the concept of a NATO deterrent and thequestion how far Western Europe should be associated more closely with the Anglo-United States nuclear partnership.(b) NATO. We must not reduce our present commitment of forces to NATOunless we can persuade our allies either that maintaining them at theirpresent level represents an over-insurance or that there is a still morepressing need for them elsewhere. But our allies already think thatour contribution is too small and we should be cautious even in our efforts to win them to our point of view if these might endanger theconfidence and cohesion of the Alliance.(c) Defence Policy of the United Kingdom Outside Europe. Our all-regular forces will be much smaller (400,000) than those of the last decade(850,000 at the maximum). There is a programme for progressiveimprovement in their mobility, for increases in the range and capacityof Transport Command, for the introduction of air-portable equipment,and for the creation of commando carriers. All these measures are designed to support the military presence of the United Kingdom inthe Middle East, Persian Gulf and South-East Asia. It seems certainthat the interests of the United Kingdom, and of the West generally,in these areas will require a continuing military effort throughout thenext decade, though not necessarily on the present scale. There willbe a premium on self-contained forces, highly mobile and transportableover long distances. We must not only retain the ability to transportthese forces to trouble spots quickly: we must also ensure that, oncearrived, they are both operationally and administratively effective.Whatever is possible along these lines we must recognise that the effectiveness of our military effort outside Europe is jeopardised by theinstability of our overseas bases and our dependence on insecure rightsof staging and overflying. Current policy assumes the retention of overseas bases, especially in Cyprus, Aden and Singapore, and our continued use of air reinforcement routes with important staging posts in Libya, Nigeria, Kenya and the Indian Ocean (Gan). There aredangers in this situation which, in varying degree, threaten the interestsof the West as a whole. We should therefore discuss frankly with our principal allies the weaknesses inherent in the present position over thewhole area from Libya to Singapore. The most vulnerable and important base is Singapore. If it were lost, forward bases in Borneo,the Maldives or elsewhere, combined with the use of certain facilities in Australia, might provide a partial substitute. These problemsrequire further study.(d) Limited War. This includes any emergency short of global war likely to arise during the next ten years. If we or the West are drawn into alimited war our aim will be to achieve our political objectives and toavoid any extension of hostilities. The aim of the United Nations willbe to stop the fighting as soon as possible. In these circumstances wewould hope that in a war of this nature major operations could belimited to a matter of weeks rather than months. There can, however,be no certainty about this, particularly in the Far East where fightingmight well continue longer. If it is assumed that this type of operation will be unlikely to take place in airy one of the three main theatres at intervals of less than two years, plans for stocks of equipment andammunition should be prepared with emphasis on speed of deployment of our forces into action rather than on long periods of heavy fighting.So far as possible provision should also be made for these forces toremain poised for considerable periods before or after any actualfighting.(e) Tactical Nuclear Weapons. Detailed consideration has not yet been givento the political, financial and military implications of the equipment ofour forces with tactical nuclear weapons.   However, two essentials
stand out. The introduction of nuclear weapons must not be allowed pe *to go so far as to inhibit the usefulness of our forces in conventional^roles. Outside Europe, at any rate, the ability to deal with minorconflicts by conventional means must be retained. There will, however,be circumstances in limited war when, as in the NATO Strategic concept,the known existence of a nuclear capacity with our forces might act asan effective deterrent. A more thorough study is needed before firmrecommendations can be made on this subject.(/) Manpower.- Whatever improvements are made in the mobility and strikingpower of our all-regular forces, we shall have little if any margin to spare. Any long term or substantial increase in internal1 security duties would impair our ability to meet existing defence commitments. Aserious situation would be created by the withdrawal of Gurkhamanpower in the Far East.Conclusions on Aid17. It is at present estimated that by 1963 the United Kingdom will be givingeconomic aid partly in grants, partly in loans, at the rate of between  170- 190millions per annum. These figures are tentative. On the one hand they will need to be reviewed from time to time in the light of the prospective load on thebalance of payments. On the other, although they include estimates of future requirements which are not yet firm, there is no reason to believe that they areexhaustive. They make no allowance for sudden changes in the political andeconomic scene which might well bring for the United Kingdom new and pressingclaims: on past experience it would be surprising if no such changes took place.Moreover, and perhaps most important of all, they implicitly assume a continuanceof United States effort at its present level and make no allowance for what mightbe required of the United Kingdom if the level of United States aid were to decline.After 1963, the prospect is even more obscure. But the effort required of theUnited Kingdom is likely to increase still further, rather than diminish.18. Three-quarters of this total ( 130- 150 millions out of a total of 170- 190 millions) is expected to go to the Commonwealth. Colonial territories are a direct responsibility of the United Kingdom. The independent Membersof the Commonwealth have a major claim upon our resources, not least becauseother potential donors regard them as being largely our responsibility. Thisallocation of our aid seems justified, but it is possible that over the decade changing circumstances may make it desirable for us to give an increased proportion to countries outside the Commonwealth.19. During the next ten years overseas aid will continue to be provided bythe United Kindom for the Colonies on a bilateral basis. The same will apply tomany of the independent under-developed members of the Commonwealth, though there may be occasions when it will be found appropriate for aid to them as toother Commonwealth members to be channelled multilaterally, either throughinternational organisations or by consortium arrangements. It should be our aim to adopt, so far as possible, arrangements of this latter kind for aid to foreigncountries, though occasionally bilateral aid will alone bring the full political advantage to the United Kingdom. In general multilateral aid is most likely tobring forward the maximum contribution from other countries. Further it reduces the economic risks to ourselves by giving the best opening to our exports.Experience shows also that it may be more acceptable to the recipients and thuspolitically more effective.Balance in the Allocation of Resources20. Broadly, there are three main elements in the resources allocated to defence and overseas policies. In 1959 defence itself cost  1,550 millions (plusabout  20 millions for home defence). Economic aid cost  131 millions.Diplomatic information and cultural activities cost about  35 millions. All these claims are complementary. Basically they all have the same object that of keeping the free world out of the Communist camp. All are charges on economic resources and on our balance of payments. Given the fact that we have limited resources to devote to the support of our security and foreign policy, they are in competition.
P 21. In this competition, diplomatic information and cultural expenditure has*a special place.   It has an importance out of proportion to its size.   But because it is small, the main rivals for the allocation of resources are defence and economic aid.22. In practice, this competition relates primarily to the world outside Europe.Some form of strategic nuclear deterrent and our contribution to the forces of nato are essential on any reckoning. What is in question is the best way ofmaking our contribution to the general Western cause in the Middle East, in africa and in Asia.23. Economic aid has some particular arguments in its favour. First, wehave both political and humanitarian obligations to under-developed countries, andpublic opinion is becoming increasingly inclined to accept this fact. Secondly, in contrast to expenditure on defence, aid can bring us economic returns. On theother hand, economic aid is a direct burden on the balance of payments. some military expenditure overseas is also a direct burden but it is more properlyconsidered as part of total defence expenditure, which imposes an indirect burden on the balance of payments through its claims on the economy as a whole.24. In practice no amount of economic aid will do our cause any good ifCommunist arms are unopposed. For the West as a whole, defence must comefirst. This has special implications for United Kingdom policy since we and, ina different way, the Americans have widespread military commitments outside europe which no other Power can take over and which, if they were abandoned,would leave dangerous vacuums. It is important that our allies should give uscredit for our world-wide effort.25. It is difficult to determine at any given time the right balance betweendefence and aid. There are no precise criteria for measuring the risk involved in reducing one commitment or the advantages to be gained from increasing another.The problem is long-term and global in character: it will rarely if ever pose itself in simple terms as, for instance, whether the presence of our troops is of morevalue to Malaya than the help we give under the Colombo Plan. In order todetermine whether the present overall balance is about right, it is necessary toconsider what the effect of changing it would be. What would be the risks andadvantages at stake in switching a significant block of resources from defence to continue aid between now and 1965?26. Certain preliminary considerations stand out. For political and economic reasons flexibility in our expenditure is limited. Changes would have to bemade gradually: for instance the sudden abandonment of any of our defence commitments might start a chain reaction which we should not be able to check.Changes would also have to be co-ordinated in advance with our allies; in certain cases we could only afford to give up or reduce one of our commitments if someoneelse was prepared to take it on. Nevertheless the possibility over a period of timeof switching resources from defence to economic aid without complete dislocation of our policies undoubtedly exists.  The question is whether it is right.27. If such a switch were being considered it would be necessary to decide which part of our defence effort should be cut. It can be argued that theraison d&apos;etre for our forces outside Europe is, in the last resort, less convincingthan the case for the strategic deterrent and our contribution to the NATO shieldforces. In a sense our military presence outside Europe is the residue of the large forces which we deployed in those areas in the post-war decade and indeed of thepre-war period, when the Indian Army was the mainstay of our defence in theMiddle East and the Far East. Part III of the Report has shown the risks inherent in our Far East position Gurkha manpower and the uncertain tenure of singapore as a base. Whatever representations we may make to them, Australia and NewZealand are unlikely to add much to the small defence contribution they aremaking at present. The picture of the future is perhaps less precai-ious in theMiddle East, though taking into account, for example, what has been said inPart III about the uncertain future in the Persian Gulf, the capacity to fulfil ourpresent commitments in that area cannot be guaranteed.28. But there is another side to this. There is an increasing need to maintainmobile, self-contained units able rapidly to meet threats to British or WesternInterests in any corner of the globe.   Our presence in the Middle East and Asia
and our possession of a chain of bases means that we are specially qualified tccprovide such forces. By doing so we support the Atlantic Alliance. Moreover^it seems hardly feasible in practice that the Americans or any other member of the alliance could, even if they wished, relieve us of all these commitments duringthe next decade.29. The previous paragraphs only touch on a complex problem. Even if thebalance between defence, aid and other overseas activities is rightly struck at aparticular time, the situation is always liable to change, either because theSino-Soviet bloc change the direction of their threats or because of some majordislocation in the taut and over-extended framework of our own commitments.If we are to hold a proper balance in the forward planning of resources allocated to these purposes, the position should be kept under regular review.General Conclusions30. Underlying all these problems of the size and nature of our contributionare certain fundamental conclusions which have recurred constantly in the threeParts of this Report and apply to every facet of our policy. It is these which should determine our actions over the next 10 years:  (a) We must work increasingly with and through our friends and allies.   our defence and overseas policies must be adapted to this concept.(b) The core of our policy is the Atlantic Alliance.   Our main task in thenext decade will be to maintain and make more intimate theassociation between North America, the United Kingdom and thecontinental countries of Western Europe. We must therefore workto ensure continuation of the United States presence in Europe,effective co-operation between ourselves and the continental countries,and the development of a wide economic and political community of interests embracing both the United States and Western Europe.(c) We must do all we can to strengthen the Commonwealth, which can be a valuable instrument for maintaining our influence as a Power with world-wide interests and for propagating our ideas and ideals, and can form a bridge between the Western world and the developing countries of Asia and Africa.(d) The main area of conflict will be the under-developed countries.  To keep them in the non-Communist world will call for a sustained and expensive effort of economic aid and the complementary political,information and cultural activities. The United Nations can be ofpositive assistance, but to ensure this will call for a careful approachby the United Kingdom.(e) All this aid could be wasted if it were not backed by an adequate defence effort by the West.(/) The total burden on the United Kingdom is unlikely to get lighter. If weare to maintain our present external policies we cannot expect toreduce the 8-2- per cent, of the Gross National Product now devoted to defence, aid and other overseas activities. Part II shows that if thepublic can be brought to accept the implications the burden can becarried. In the light of Part III, the inescapable conclusion is that itshould.(g) To lighten it as far as possible we must make the best use of our resources material, intellectual and scientific. Our effort must be selective,and we must rely more heavily on interdependence with our allies ifwe are to make do with our limited means.(/?) The ability of the United Kingdom to play its full part in meeting the commitments of the West over the next decade will largely depend onthe co-operation of our friends and allies. If they do not makecomparable efforts, in defence and aid, our prospects of carrying out our own programmes will be jeopardised. Most of them are doing lessthan their fair share and we must aim to make them realise this and do more.
iR-yCabinet Office, S.W. 1,24th February, 1960.(/) Our economy must be kept strong and in balance if the required effort isto be maintained. This will call for restraint on the part of the public.If these are to be accepted, the policies of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill need to be presented in such a way as to command the widestmeasure of understanding and support.(/&apos;) The main problem is to keep the balance right between the competing claims, domestic and external, on the national resources and, withinthe resources applied to the support of external policy, between theclaims for defence, for economic aid and for other overseas expenditure.(k) It is recommended that this Report and its conclusions, as finally approved,should be kept under regular review.(Signed)       NORMAN BROOK (Chairman)MOUNTBATTEN OF BURMACHARLES LAMBEFRANCIS FESTINGD.
