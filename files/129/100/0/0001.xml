secret this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1960C. (60) 1 Copy -No.    SO75? January, I960CABINETFUTURE OF EAST AFRICAN LAND forces memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies in July 1957, in consequence of the recommendations in Sir Gerald Templer&apos;sReport on Colonial Security, 1955, administrative and financial responsibility forthe East African Land Forces (E.A.L.F.) (the King&apos;s African Rifles and supportingunits) was transferred from the War Office to the three East African Governments,who established the East African Land Forces Organisation for this purpose.Operational control remained with the G.O.C. East Africa Command, who is appointed by the East African Governors and is answerable to them. The whole cost of the E.A.L.F. (apart from the Mauritius Garrison, which will be withdrawnby June 1960) is met from funds voted annually by the Legislatures of Kenya,Uganda and Tanganyika.The Need for a Change in policy . Recent developments in East Africa have made it clear that it will become increasingly important for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to insure against the risks of advance towards responsible government. Our position in East Africa may be gravely prejudiced if we have no effective means of controlling constitutional development in Kenya (and to some extent Uganda), or if our decision to go moreor less with the tide in Tanganyika goes badly wrong e.g., through Nyerere, the leader of the Tanganyika African National Union, losing control.3. The internal security forces in East Africa, i.e., the police as well as theEast African Land Forces, are the foundation of the Governor^ authority and themeans by which it is possible to resist unconstitutional and illegal pressures for ourquick exit from the region. The military forces are organised under one centralcommand (and not territorially) and can be swiftly deployed between the three territories if the need arises. The probability that political advance towards self-government will have to be faster than we think ideally right makes it all the moreimportant that we should, as a brake on that advance, do all we can now, before itis too late, to insulate all the internal security forces of the territories from local political control. So far as the police are concerned it would be politically impossible to do more than resolve to maintain our control first by includingresponsibility for the police in the portfolio of an official Minister and at a later stage if necessary through the maintenance of ultimate control in the hands of theGovernor. In respect of the Land Forces there is now an excellent opportunity tomake a radical change. The fact that it will not be possible, to divorce theadministration of the police altogether from local politics does not fortunately affectthe local value of this change as our unfettered control of the military forces willgive the Governors the necessary backing in the event of serious trouble and restoreto Her Majesty&apos;s Government one political counter of great value.4. Our control of the East African Land Forces is at present endangered bythe fact that they depend on funds voted by territorial Legislatures which are likely
to become increasingly controlled by local politicians. This presents the followingdangers:  (i) The budget of the military forces may be cut for political reasons to thepoint where they are so short of men (including British secondedpersonnel) and equipment that they are unable to fulfil their roleefficiently.(ii) As providers of the funds, the local politicians will inevitably regardij 3 defence as within their scope and may seek to interfere with the useof the forces. The Governors power to employ these forces for any purpose he thinks fit, particularly to combat threats to law and ordercreated by the local politicians themselves, will be progressivelyinhibited, and, as this happens, Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ powers of resistance to local political demands for quicker progress will be prejudiced.(iii) The central control and organisation of the forces will be prejudiced bydemands that each territory should have its own army, which would diminish the strategic mobility of the E.A.L.F. and make the task of preserving law and order much harder. Demands of this kind are bound to grow in strength under the present arrangements as territoriesassume more and more responsibility for their internal government.5. When submitting proposals relating to future policy in East Africa to hiscolleagues in the Colonial Policy Committee, my predecessor expressed the view(which I share) that no time should be lost in trying to devise a method by which her Majesty&apos;s Government might retain for a considerable, if not indefinite, periodsome control in the area in matters of vital concern. My basic assumption is thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government will have certain vital interests to safeguard in thearea for some considerable time after the dates when we shall be bound on general political grounds to grant independence to Tanganyika and Uganda. As my predecessor suggested, there are four possibilities which will deserve carefulconsideration:  (i) To maintain ultimate power in the vital matters in Kenya for an indefinite period, leaving the other (mainland) territories to.become fully self-governing.(ii) To maintain control by Her Majesty&apos;s Government over Zanzibar,including Mombasa and the coastal strip, leaving the rest of kenya and the mainland territories to become fully self-governing.(iii) To develop all the mainland territories, and possibly also Zanzibar, as full self-governing territories but associated under a Federal-type structurecontrolled (for a time at least) by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.. (iv) To abandon the idea of working towards any of these &quot; physical&quot;solutions, but to allow these territories to develop normally towardsfull self-government and rely on defence and other agreements for the securing of any interests which might still be vital to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.I am examining the matter now and am not yet ready to make definite proposals,I have, however, already announced my intention of discussing with the Governorslater on the working of the High Commission, and any decisions then reached maywell have a bearing on what may eventually emerge in terms of constitutional machinery or in other ways as a means of ensuring a continued position for her majesty&apos;s Government in the area. Although it would be clearly premature forme now to express a definite view on the right course to take, I feel certain that inconnexion with our long-term planning it is important to have previouslyorganised the administration of the local forces in East Africa on a centralisedbasis paid for directly by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. In other words, even ifdevelopments over the next years prove our fears about losing our control over theforces to have been groundless, there would nevertheless be considerable advantage in assuming the cost of the local forces so as not to prejudice any new arrangements that might be devised or indeed so as to prepare the way for such arrangements.Present proposals. I therefore propose that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should (throughthe War Office) resume administrative and financial responsibility for the E.A.L.F.,in order that this vital weapon in the preservation of law and order should be
firmly in the hands of the Governors and out of reach of the local politicians.The War Office are willing to undertake this task, which will incidentally enable a more efficient command organisation to be established in East Africa. Thefinancial issues have been fully discussed between my officials and those of theChancellor of the Exchequer whose position has been reserved.7. The annual recurrent cost of E.A.L.F. is  2-4 millions while capital works are likely to be about  500,000 per annum. I have considered very carefully whetherit would be desirable to ask the territories for a fixed annual contribution related totheir ability to pay. In the case of Tanganyika and Uganda such a contribution would no doubt be more than offset by the financial assistance which they will be receiving from the United Kingdom. It may therefore be difficult to make themunderstand why a contribution should be required and this in turn may increasethe degree of acrimony in debates in their Legislatures on the subject of the annual contribution to the cost of the land forces. In the case of Kenya some contribution from their own funds is clearly possible but even if, for fornfs sake, contributionsare taken from the other territories, it will be clear that Kenya is alone making an effective contribution and this too may well lead to increased bitterness in debate in the Legislature. I am therefore doubtful about the wisdom of seekinglocal contributions. If my colleagues nevertheless consider that it would be advisable to seek local contributions (and 1 recognise that there are strong arguments in favour of this course) then I will of course do so.8. Although the reason for this proposal is political, it will be necessary toavoid presenting the change to the public, and especially the public in East Africa,as being made for this reason. On the other hand, to minimise embarrassingrepercussions in other territories outside East Africa, it would be desirable toavoid claiming that the reason was primarily financial. I therefore propose thatthe direct financial benefits should not be played up and thatsome reference bemade to organisational improvements resulting from the change. Any public announcement would state that, in deciding on this step, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had had regard not only to the present budgetary position of the territories but also the desirability of bringing on to a more centralised basis allthe arrangements governing the control and administration of these forces.9. There is, however, one further important consideration which affects thequestion of contribution (paragraph 6) and also that of the timing of any announcement. It is clear that the forthcoming Kenya Constitutional conference is going to be difficult. I have told the representatives of. political organisationsin Kenya that, while I shall strive to the utmost to assess and conciliate divergentviews, I shall not necessarily impose my own solution in the event of the differingKenya views proving irreconcilable. There are many reasons why the rate of constitutional advance must be slower in Kenya than in the other two territories.This will doubtless be a bitter pill for the Kenya African leaders to swallow.I have no wish to make their position any more difficult than it need be and I am sure that if I am able to demonstrate my readiness to make available increasedfunds for the development of agriculture and African education this may wellgive me a good chance of securing agreement at the Conference on lines acceptable to Her Majesty&apos;s Government. I therefore seek authority to announce, at an appropriate time during the Kenya Conference, that Her Majesty&apos;s government proposes to resume administrative responsibility for the East African Land forces and to meet their cost (either in whole, as I would wish, or in part) thereby releasingfunds in Kenya for further African development.10. I have mentioned possible repercussions of my proposal on other territories with local forces. It is to be expected that other Governments willmake what use they can of the arrangements proposed for East Africa.Governments most likely to do this are Singapore, Sierra Leone and the west indies. The West Indies is already in receipt of a block grant-in-aid over a five-year period from the United Kingdom in respect of some of the unit territories andthe funds of the Federal Government are strictly limited by the Constitution itself.There is already a one battalion local force (the West India Regiment) and it isdesirable that before long it should be increased to two battalions. The adoptionof the proposal in respect of East Africa may well result in a demand from theFederal Government for United Kingdom assistance towards the annualmaintenance cost of at any rate the two battalion force. I do not say that it wouldbe impossible to resist such a demand, but the East African proposal might make
Qit more difficult to do so. Singapore has already lodged requests for financial help from us, one being that we should take over the cost of financing her local forces.We expect a request from Sierra Leone for financial assistance to meet theincreased recurrent expenditure, of which defence expenditure would be a part,likely to result from independence, if granted.11. Although the East African arrangements may induce these governments to press their requests for financial assistance in the form of contributions fromthe United Kingdom towards the cost of local forces, I do not think that theEast African precedent as such would involve us in providing substantial additionalfinancial assistance to other Governments over and above that which we should probably have to provide in any case. But it might mean that more of the helpwe had to give would take the form of assistance towards the cost of upkeep oflocal forces than would otherwise be the case.Timing of Transfer12. Events are moving swiftly in East Africa and urgent action is necessary if the opportunity to take over administrative and financial responsibility for theE.A.L.F. is not to be missed. Operational control will of course remain withthe G.O.C. under the direction of the Governors acting in their discretion. Fortheir own reasons (connected with the command and organisation of the strategic reserve in Kenya) the War Office are anxious for an early decision. The nextEast African financial year begins on 1st July, 1960, and I propose that the change should take effect from that date.Recommendation13.   I invite my colleagues to agree that:  . (i) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should resume administrative responsibilityfor the East African Land Forces with effect from the 1st July, 1960.(ii) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should assume full financial responsibility forthe forces from the same date.(iii) Local contributions towards the cost of the forces need not be sought(which I strongly prefer); but that if as a matter of principle they shouldbe required I be given discretion to waive the principle (completelyif necessary) if I am satisfied that a satisfactory outcome of the KenyaConference is not otherwise possible.I. M.Colonial Office, S.W.1,31st December, 1959.
