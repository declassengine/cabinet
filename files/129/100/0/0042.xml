Printed for the Cabinet.   March I960C. (60) 42 Copy No.   g &quot;J7th March, 1960CABINETCOMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH Japan Memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Economic Policy Committee considered my memorandum (E.A. (60) 13)which dealt with two major issues of policy arising in connexion with Anglo-Japanese commercial relations, viz.:(i) The proposed Commercial Treaty.(ii) Article XXXV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.2.   The paper recommended that:(i) We should resume negotiations for the Treaty and be willing to considerthe inclusion of a clause giving Japan most-favoured-nation rights in thematter of quantitative restrictions, provided that it is qualified bysafeguards which will enable us to protect United Kingdom industriesfrom disruptive competition from Japan.(ii) We should be ready to consider ceasing to invoke Article XXXV if asatisfactory Treaty can be concluded, provided that arrangements aremade to ensure that, in the matter of quantitative restrictions, theTreaty with its safeguards is overriding.3. The Economic Policy Committee agreed on the political advantages ofending our present discrimination against Japanese products; and suggested thatto do so might also provide a basis for approaching the United States about areduction in their restrictions on imports from Commonwealth countries.4. The selection of the industries for which continued protection under theproposed &quot; safeguards &quot; will be necessary will clearly be a matter of difficulty andwe shall have to take into account many varied considerations, such as the size and strength of the industry; its location and degree of concentration; the probablestrength of Japanese competition; and the existence of special factors, such as theemployment of a high proportion of disabled persons. Moreover, it will be forconsideration whether there are sensitive industries in the Colonies whose interestin the United Kingdom market ought to be protected against Japanese competition:&apos;and whether, if imports of any goods from Commonwealth countries are stillrestricted when the time comes, they must continue also to be restricted from japan. However, these are detailed problems on which immediate decisions arenot required and which can be the subject of further study.5. The Economic Policy Committee came to the conclusion that it was desirable, on balance, to enter into negotiations with Japan on the basis suggested and I now ask my colleagues to endorse this recommendation. I shall of coursekeep them informed of the progress of negotiations.R. M.       iBoard of Trade, S.W. 1,7th March, I960.56671
