This statement was welcomed by the Nigerian Federal Prime-Minister and the Regional Premiers, who expressed their desire that onindependence Nigeria should become a full member of the Commonwealth nnd1that there should continue to be close co-operation between Britain and Nigeria,2. The Nigerian Federal Legislature was dissolved at the beginning OfDecember and fresh elections to a new, enlarged House of Representatives tookplace on .12th December. The results were much as expected. The largest party,with 142 seats, was the Northern People&apos;s Congress (N.P.C.), the conservative&apos;Muslim party which is in effect restricted to the Northern Region. The next largestparty, with 89 seats, was the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons(N.C.N.C.) and their allies, led by Dr. Azikiwe. The Action GrOup, led byChief Awolowo, with 72 seats, came third. This result was preferable to an overallmajority by any one party, since the only party which could have expected sucha victory was the N.P.C. and one-party rule by the N.P.C. might well have reopenedold divisions between the North and the South. The Federal Prime Minister,Alhaji Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa (N.P.C.) was reappointed Prime Minister andhas formed a coalition Government of the N.P.C. and the N.C.N.C. The ActionGroup now form the official Federal Opposition.3. On 16th January, the day after the Federal House of Representatives had heard an address from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Nigeria&apos;sFederal Prime Minister proposed a motion as follows.-1 &quot; This House authorises the Government of the Federation of Nigeria to request Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom as soon aspracticable to introduce legislation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom,providing for the establishment of the Federation of Nigeria on 1st October,1960, as an independent sovereign State, and to request Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom at the appropriate time to support withthe other Member Governments of the Commonwealth Nigeria&apos;s desire tobecome a member of the Commonwealth.&quot;The resolution was carried unanimously and with enthusiasm. It wasconcurred in unanimously by the Federal Senate on 25th January. The resolutionhas now been formally transmitted to me by the Governor-General, with the requestof the Nigerian Federal Government that effect should now be given to it.4. My predecessor^ undertaking was unqualified and binding. There wouldin any case be no reason to hesitate before honouring it.

nevertheless, firm bonds of friendship between Nigeria and ourselves have beenforged and are to-day as strong as ever. We are not likely to have a firmer friendamong our former colonial territories in Africa.5. The British Cameroons will have to be separated from Nigeria pendingUnited Nations decisions on its future.r. 6. The drafting of a defence agreement is at an advanced stage and it is abouti&amp; %e put tojNigerian Ministers. I do not expect that it will provoke any serious difficulty. I understand that the Prime Minister was impressed, when he was inLagos in January, with the extent of Nigerian anxieties aboutvthe security Of theirborders after independence, especially in view of the troubled situation in theRepublic of Cameroun. The Defence Committee is to discuss the question ofUnited Kingdom help to Nigeria in this field as part of the defence agreement.7. I suggest that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in May mightbe told informally of the prospect of Nigerian independence on 1st October, andof the Nigerian Federal Government^ wish (supported by all members of theFederal Legislature) to become a member of the Commonwealth. Nigeria&apos;s formalapplication for membership will have to await the Royal Assent to the NigerianIndependence Bill, probably in August or September this year.8. I now seek my colleagues&apos; approval for the proposal that I should send,on behalf of Her Majesty V Government, a reply to the Governor-General of nigeria welcoming the resolution passed by the Federal House of Representatives,and saying that (i) Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be glad to introduce legislation at an appropriate date to enable the Federation of Nigeria to become fullyindependent on the 1st October, 1960; and (ii) the Nigerian desire for membership of the Commonwealth on independence will be communicated informally to theCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in May and a formal application will be transmitted to Commonwealth Governments on Nigeria&apos;s behalf after the royal assent has been given to the Nigerian Independence Act.9. I should hope to introduce the necessary Bill after Whitsun. There willalso be a large Order in Council setting out the constitution as agreed at the conferences held in London in 1957 and 1958.I.
