(60) 38 Copy No.4th March, 1960CABINET55UNITED KINGDOM ASSISTANCE TO OVERSEAS territories memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate for consideration by the Cabinet a draft White Paper on UnitedKingdom Assistance to Overseas Territories. Subject to the approval of mycolleagues, the White Paper will be published on 14th March to precede the references which the Prime Minister will, no doubt, be making to this subject inhis speech to the Commonwealth and Empire Industries&apos; Association on thefollowing day. A series of Press hand-outs in different parts of the world willsupplement this publicity by stressing particular themes with local interests inmind.2. The Economic Policy Committee have considered the draft White Paperagainst the background of a general report by officials on development policy, andthe attached draft takes account of amendments agreed in the Committee. TheCommittee intend to discuss further the broader aspects of the scale, nature and direction of our assistance to overseas countries when two additional reports areavailable, namely, one on balance of payments prospects and another on projectedUnited Kingdom external investment in the period 1960-63. It is clear, however,from the probable trend of our balance of payments, which is already apparent,that we should not be justified in giving an assurance in the White Paper that theUnited Kingdom intended to continue to expand her overseas assistance. Thatwould stimulate hopes which might be difficult to fulfil.3. The subject of overseas assistance for development raises fundamentalquestions of financial, economic and overseas policy, and of public relations, and itis my intention to bring the matter before the Cabinet again for a wider discussionwhen the further reports on the balance of payments and external investment areavailable.4. In the meantime the Economic Policy Committee concluded that it will be useful to publish this White Paper, which sets out the facts regarding the present scale of our assistance to overseas development.D.

DRAFT WHITE PAPER ON ASSISTANCE FROM THE UNITEDKINGDOM FOR OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENTAIMS AND METHODSThe Aims1. The Queen&apos;s speech on 27th October, 1959, contained the following passage:&quot; The improvement of conditions of life in the less-developed countries of the world will remain an urgent concern of my Government. Theywill promote economic co-operation between the nations and support plans for financial and technical assistance.&quot;The Government of the United Kingdom has thus reaffirmed its continuinginterest in the welfare of the poorer countries overseas and its intentionto go on helping them and to co-operate in international plans directed to that object.2. Malnutrition is the common lot of millions in the poorer countries ofthe world. Housing is frequently primitive, transport and communications are very limited, basic social services that we take for granted are almostnon-existent. Two-thirds of the world&apos;s population live in countries whichface problems like these. In India, for example, there are eight times as many people as in this country: their average income per head,  23 a year,is one-sixteenth of ours. There is a growing determination in the poorercountries to rise out of poverty through economic development. They aremaking great efforts themselves, and the larger part of the money they arespending on capital development comes from their own resources. Butadditional resources, and in particular foreign exchange to buy plant and materials from abroad, are an essential supplement. There is a challenge tothe advanced countries to help them to help themselves.3, The purpose of this Paper is to describe the part which the UnitedKingdom is playing in the provision of assistance for overseas development.Although private capital has been, and in general still is, the main source of finance from the United Kingdom, many of the poorer countries cannotunder present conditions attract all the private capital they need. They arelooking increasingly for help from Governments and from the international institutions which have been established with Government funds. The paper is therefore concerned partly with private investment but primarily with theassistance provided from the United Kingdom Exchequer sometimes directly and sometimes through these international institutions for the less-developed countries of the world.Private Investment4. The United Kingdom is prominent among the small group ofindustrially-advanced nations from which funds for investment abroad are provided by private individuals and companies. These funds are investedthrough a variety of channels, and one organisation, the commonwealth development Finance Company, has been specially established to facilitate the investment of private capital in the Commonwealth. Information aboutthe extent of United Kingdom private investment overseas is at present notprecise, and measures have recently been taken to improve our knowledge.On the information at present available it is estimated that the total has5
averaged over the last seven years  300 million a year.* This estimateincludes sums averaging about  55 million a year that have been raised onthe London market by the Governments of independent Commonwealth and colonial countries and by public corporations and companies.5. The investment of this money is frequently accompanied by the availability of United Kingdom knowledge and experience of industrial and commercial business. Intangible assistance of this kind cannot be evaluated,but it is an important additional contribution.6. A large amount, in total, of commercial credit is extended by UnitedKingdom exporters to overseas importers of United Kingdom goods inaccordance with normal trade practice. Much of this is under guarantee bythe Export Credits Guarantee Department; and much of it is in respect ofgoods supplied to the less developed countries. Such credit is, in general,however, of a short or medium-term nature and is not therefore included inthe estimate of  300 million for the amount of private investment overseas.7. A large part of the  300 million is invested in the more developedCommonwealth countries, where a basis for industrial expansion already exists and where their rate of growth influenced for example by immigration is more rapid than they can finance from their own resources and offers an attractive prospect for investment. It is estimated that something of the orderof  100 million a year has been invested in less-developed areas. this includes some re-investment of locally earned profits but information aboutsuch re-investment is incomplete and the figure of  100 million may be too low.Government Assistance8. The aid given from the United Kingdom Exchequer for overseas development is authorised by Parliament in its approval of the annualAccounts and Estimates. Excluding military assistance and refugee relief,the total amounts paid from the United Kingdom Exchequer for this purposeover the eight financial years from 1st April, 1951, to 31st March, 1959, andthe estimate for 1959-60, are as follows:  Table IGrowth of United Kingdom Government Assistance  millionYear Total1951-52     ..............,       611952-53     .............      ...       491953-54     ...............       52-1954-55     ..........,.,........       771955-56     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...       831956-57................      ...       761957-58     ......      ...      ...      ...       811958-59     ...      ... ... HO1959-60 (Estimate)        ....... 143&apos; * This figure differs from the figure usually quoted for balance of payments purposeswhere a net figure, allowing for the investment of overseas funds in this country, is relevant.   The net figure in recent years has averaged  200 million.
9.   This assistance takes the form of:(a) grants and loans, and payments for technical assistance, under arrangements made directly with the recipient country (&quot; bilateralassistance &quot;);(b) contributions to international bodies working in this field(&quot; multilateral assistance &quot;).For the last three financial years the figures in Table I may be sub-dividedas in Table II below. The figures show the actual or estimateddisbursements, and represent entirely assistance to less developed countries,with the exception of sums of  3-7 million in 1957-58,  2-2 million in1958-59 and  3 million in 1959-60 which represent disbursements to theUnion of South Africa under International Bank loans for which part ofthe United Kingdom subscription was used.10. United Kingdom emergency assistance to Malaya, Kenya and cyprus is shown separately in Tables II and III. This does not include the basic pay and allowances of the United Kingdom armed forces which were involved, since these have been met from the Defence Departments Votes.A substantial part of this assistance has been used for strengthening thelocal administration and relieving the local budget of expenditure in various forms, thus enabling them to devote their own resources to economic and social expenditure.Table IIMake-up of United Kingdom Government Assistance4Bilateral Assistance  million	1957-58	1958-59	1959-60			(Estimate)Grants..........	35-0	33-3	39-6Loans   ...      ...	10-9	36-7	64-9Technical assistance ...	4-1	4-4	5-2Total    ......      ...	500	74-4	109-7Emergency assistance	13-3	11-7	12-5Total bilateral assistance	63-3	86-1	122-2* These categories and the sums involved differ from the presentation given in theWhite Papers on the United Kingdom Balance of Payments.   The differences arise(a) because the Balance of Payments&apos; estimates do not make a precise distinctionbetween economic assistance and other types of Government current expenditure,(b) because of timing (disbursements from Exchequer Funds are on a Financial Yearbasis), and (c) because some types of transactions included as Exchequer aid do not enter into the balance of payments.

For independent countries of the Commonwealth the primary source of United Kingdom capital has been private investment, including sumsraised on the London Market. More recently some of them (especially somewhich have only recently become independent) have been unable to raiseenough money in this way. The importance of helping them (and theColonial territories) was recognised at the Commonwealth EconomicConference in 1958, when the intention of the United Kingdom to introduce a new policy of Commonwealth Assistance Loans was announced. these loans are now available to help to provide capital for programmes of sound economic development which cannot be financed in other ways.12. There are no formal rules governing the circumstances in which commonwealth Assistance loans are granted to independent commonwealth countries. The amount depends on the particular country&apos;s needs and onthe means that the United Kingdom has from time to time for meeting them.The loans are made to independent Commonwealth countries under theprovisions of Section 3 of the Export Guarantees Act, 1949 (as sinceamended).. Loans have so far been made to India ( 28J million in December,1958;  3 million in June, 1959 and  19 million in November, 1959) and to pakistan ( 10 million in February, 1959) and Malaya ( 2^ million). Inaddition loans have been approved in principle for Ceylon ( 2\ million) and nigeria for use after independence ( 12 million). . Figures for drawings onthese loans, together with drawings on the Section 3 loan of  10 millionmade to Pakistan in 1954 and on a Section 3 loan made in July 1958 toIndia in connection with the Durgapur steelworks, are included in the tables.Colonial Territories- ... 13. The United Kingdom Government has a special responsibility forthe Colonial territories and financial assistance to them is provided on.capital
account for economic development and, where necessary, on current account tohelp their general budgetary position. Under Section 1 of the colonial development and Welfare Act both grants and loans are provided, mainly for public development programmes, and altogether  220 million was madeavailable for the period 1946-60. Of this about  45-5 million was unspentby 3.1st March, 1959, and recent legislation has provided for an additional 95 million for the period up to 31st March, 1964, giving a total of 140-5 million for expenditure in the years 1959-64. In addition grants and loans from Departmental Votes are made available to colonial governments which heed help either to balance their current budgets or for specific purposes such as emergency expenditure or hurricane rehabilitation.14. Colonial territories have also been able to raise loans in the london market; but to the extent that this is not possible, loans from the Exchequerhave been made available to them also since the Montreal Conference tohelp to fill the gap. Powers to make such loans have been taken in Section 2of the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1959, under which such loanscan be approved up to a ceiling of  25 million a year within a total of  100million for the five-year period 1959-64. It is expected that loans up to  20million will be approved during the current financial year, but it is not expected that the whole of this sum will be spent in the period. An estimateof  15 million has been included in Table III below. Loans made include 1 - 5 million to Kenya,  1 - 5 million to Sierra Leone and  3 million will bemade to Nigeria before independence.15. United Kingdom Government funds are also used to assist theeconomic development of the Colonial territories through the medium of theColonial Development Corporation, set up by the Overseas resources development Act, 1948. The Corporation undertakes agricultural, industrial and other types of projects on a commercial basis, generally in partnership with private enterprise or Colonial Governments. It has powers to borrowup to  150 million long-term ( 130 million from the Consolidated Fund)and  10 million short-term. Its capital requirements have so far been supplied entirely by issues from the Consolidated Fund which at presenttotal  68 million. Issues of  3 million in 1957-58,  5-8 million in 1958-59and  4-2 million in 1959-60 have been included in the Tables.Newly Independent Members of the Commonwealth16. Colonial territories which become independent members of theCommonwealth continue to receive, as required, sums equivalent to theamounts outstanding in respect of projects already approved under theColonial Development and Welfare Act. The Colonial development corporation are able to continue projects approved before independence and,if necessary, to invest additional funds in them. The countries in questioncease to be eligible for Colonial Exchequer loans, but become eligible for commonwealth Assistance loans on the same basis as other independent commonwealth countries and technical assistance continues to be available.Ghana has received since she became independent  350,000 outstandingunder the Colonial Development and Welfare Act and also technical assistance. Malaya is receiving the unexpended balance of her colonial development and Welfare allocations amounting to  3 - 7 millions the
Commonwealth Assistance Loan of  2J million mentioned in paragraph 12above, grants totalling  7 - 6 million for emergency expenditure, and  310,000for the University of Malaya. A Commonwealth Assistance Loan of  12million has, as also mentioned in paragraph 12, been agreed upon for Nigeriafor use after independence.Education17. Education is an indispensable condition of development; it is essen-tial not only for material prosperity through technological changes, but forthe training of leaders and led in Government, industry, the professions andother aspects of a nation&apos;s life. In this sphere, even more important thanmoney is the personal contribution of trained men and women the supplyof teachers and other educational experts from the United Kingdom and theprovision here of facilities for training teachers and others from overseas,18. About 2,500 teachers from this country go annually to serve in commonwealth countries and some 500 to foreign countries, on interchangeschemes, short-term contracts, or permanent emigration. An important element in the work of United Kingdom teachers abroad is the teaching of english. The work of the British Council in this field has been expanded inrecent years, and further proposals for strengthening their activities are nowbeing carried out.19. The United Kingdom provides substantial numbers of places for overseas students at Universities, Technical Colleges, Teacher TrainingInstitutions and other training establishments, including places for trainingin both private and nationalised industry and in commerce, nursing andmany other occupations. There are at present approximately 40,000 studentsfrom overseas, most of them from the less developed countries of theCommonwealth, undergoing a full-time course of instruction in the UnitedKingdom. Only a small proportion of these students are financed directly by scholarships from H.M. Government, but the United Kingdom Exchequermeets a large part of the cost of their education here in other ways.20. The Commonwealth Economic Conference at Montreal gave a newimpetus to plans for assistance by the United Kingdom in this field. Aspart of a co-ordinated new effort a number of fresh proposals were workedouj. at the Commonwealth Education Conference at Oxford in July, 1959.These include the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan underwhich the United Kingdom Government has agreed to make available forstudents from other Commonwealth countries, including Colonial territories,500 scholarships tenable at any one time in United Kingdom universities, &amp;c.With the co-operation of local eduction authorities, teachers&apos; associations,and others concerned, the United Kingdom also proposes to provide from1960 some 400 additional places, with fees and maintenance paid from united Kingdom funds, at Teacher Training establishments;, to make avail-able a proportionate share of the new places provided under the currentplan to increase the total number of places in Technical Colleges by some70 per cent, by 1970; and to encourage industry to accept yet; larger numbersof overesas students for training, financial and other measures are also being.
taken to promote the recruitment of additional United Kingdom teachers for service.overseas. It is expected that the United Kingdom Government willspend  6 million over the first five.years.on this form of assistance.Technical Assistance21. In all less developed countries, technical assistance in the form ofthe provision of experts, advisory services, training facilities and technicalequipment is necessary both as a preliminary to and in conjunction withcapital investment. Technical assistance given by private enterprise to theless developed countries usually forms an integral part of investment ortrading projects and its full extent, though very great, cannot be assessedseparately or accurately.22. The United Kingdom Government provides technical assistance for colonial territories through the Colonial Office, and to independent countries of the Commonwealth and to other countries under arrangements madedirect, under the Colombo Plan, and through the Foundation for mutual assistance in Africa South of the Sahara and the Central Treaty Organisation.23. An example of the technical assistance provided by the ColonialOffice is the training of officers in the public services of the colonial territories. Out of 2,181 such officers attending training courses in theUnited Kingdom in 1959, the cost of training 473 was met from colonial development and Welfare Funds.24. Other United Kingdom Government Departments provide a wide range of free services to overseas territories. For example in the last fiveyears the Post Office has trained over 1,000 people from overseas in postal,telephone and telegraph operations and in telecommunications engineering.The Post Office also gives specialist advice and information to many countries on request, and in engineering matters it not only advises but often acts in aliaison capacity between the overseas territory and British industry.25. In the field of scientific research there are advisory bodies dealingwith many subjects, including medicine, agriculture, forestry, social science,roads, tropical products and pesticides. The Colonial Medical research committee, for example, advises the Colonial Office and the Medical research council jointly. The Tropical Products Institute advises the Colonial office on matters concerning the greater use of Colonial plant and animal products.There is in addition the recently established Overseas Research Council,which is an advisory body and co-ordinating body exercising a generaloversight of the United Kingdom&apos;s scientific research in and for all overseas countries and in particular the newly independent countries of theCommonwealth.26s In the field of surveys the Directorate of Overseas (Geodetic andTopographic) Surveys and the Directorate..of Overseas Geological Surveysundertake surveys in the Colonial territories and advise the Colonial office on all related matters. &quot;27.   In addition, the Colonial Office has a large number of professionaladvisers and advisory bodies dealing with such subjects as education, health,labour, co-operative societies, housing, engineering, fisheries and tropicalagriculture who are able to give expert advice in teach field of activity., iAmOng the advisory bodies the Inter-University Council for Higher Education11;)
Overseas and the Council for Overseas Colleges of Arts, Science and technology occupy, a somewhat special position in that they are concernedwith autonomous institutions of higher education in the Colonial territories and operate with a large measure of independence.28. All the facilities described in paragraphs 25, 26 and 27 above areavailable if required to the independent countries of the Commonwealth aswell as to the Colonial territories. The amounts shown in Table III astechnical assistance to Colonial territories include the sums provided for research, surveys and training.The Colombo Plan29. The Colombo Plan is the name given to the whole sum of theco-operative effort which the countries of South and South-East Asia,helped by capital aid and technical assistance from member countries outsidethe region, are making to develop their economies and raise the living standards of their peoples. There is no master plan but each country of the region in carrying out its own development programme has the benefit of the consultation which takes place in the annual meetings of the Colombo PlanConsultative Committee and makes its own bilateral arrangements with other member countries lof the Plan for giving and receiving assistance. the cumulative total of assistance given by the United Kingdom Exchequer toColombo Plan countries since 1951 has reached nearly  150 million, anamount which has been taken into account in drawing up the Tables in this paper. An integral part of the Colombo Plan is the Technical Co-operationScheme and the amounts provided by the United Kingdom under this scheme in the form of technical assistance are included under the heading technical assistance in Tables II and III.Distribution of Bilateral Assistance30. The following Table shows how much economic assistance from united Kingdom Government funds has been given in the form of grants,loans and payments for technical assistance to Colonial territories, theindependent Commonwealth, and other countries. The figures representactual or estimated disbursements. The Table does not, however, includeloans made out of the United Kingdom&apos;s subscription to the international bank much of which, as explained in paragraph 34 below, was allocated tothe Commonwealth.Table IIIDistribution of United Kingdom Bilateral Assistance  million	1957-58	1958-59	1959-60Colonial Territories			(Estimate)Grants ...      ...      ...      v	28-1	26-8	31-8Loans   ...      ...      ...	..        3-9	10-9	22-7Technical assistance ...	3-0	3-0	3-1Emergency assistance ...	-      10-3	8-7	9-6: Total Colonial Territories    .	..      45-3	49-4	67-2

A full country by country breakdown of United Kingdom bilateralassistance is contained in the table annexed to this Paper.Use of Assistance,32. Table III above includes drawings on loans made under Section 3 ofthe Export Guarantees Act, 1949. These drawings amounted to  5-7 million in 1957-58,  21-7 million in 1958-59 and  43-8 million in 1959-60. the loans in question are available for the purchase of United Kingdom goods and services and the provision of related works and services in the borrowingcountry. The borrowing countries are, however, usually left to choose for themselves on which United Kingdom goods the money is spent. Only asmall proportion of the total ( 15 million in 1958-59 which was spent onthe Durgapur steelworks in India and  2 million of the estimates for 1959-60which will be spent on equipment for a pipeline in Assam) has been tied tothe purchase of specified United Kingdom exports. The other grants and loans from the United Kingdom Exchequer are untied though they frequentlylead to the placing of new orders in the United Kingdom and in any casethe United Kingdom benefits indirectly from the stimulus to international trade.
CONTRIBUTIONS  TO  INTERNATIONAL  ORGANISATIONSInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development33. The United Kingdom gives full support to the work of theInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development. This is by far the largest and most important of a number of international organisations concerned with economic development. It exists to finance sound projectsundertaken by countries within the Bank&apos;s membership. There is now along list of major enterprises that have been facilitated or made possible by the help which the Bank has given. The Bank&apos;s loans are financedpartly from the subscriptions of the member countries (the major amountcoming from the industrial countries, including the United Kingdom) andthe rest from funds which the Bank itself is able to borrow by the issue ofbonds for public subscription and in other ways. The United Kingdom&apos;ssubscription was originally $1,300 million, but it was increased in September1959 along with those of other countries and is now $2,600 million.34. Under the Bank&apos;s rules part of this subscription, $26 million, was paid in gold when the Bank was started in 1946. A further sum equivalentto $234 million has been paid in sterling. The effective expenditure of thissterling subscription has taken place, not when the subscription was paidto the International Bank, but when the Bank has used it to makedisbursements under loans to member countries. The arrangementsgoverning such disbursements have been settled from time to time betweenthe United Kingdom and the International Bank and most disbursementshave been for loans to Commonwealth countries. The rest of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s subscription is not payable except if required to enable the Bankto meet its obligations for funds borrowed by the Bank and loans guaranteed by it. Together with the uncalled subscription of other countries it providessecurity for the Bank&apos;s own borrowing. The United Kingdom&apos;s contributionto economic aid through the medium of the International Bank is thusmeasured by the rate at which disbursements are made from the sterlingsubscription.   Figures for these disbursements are given in Table II above.35. In addition, the I.B.R.D. has received private capital from theUnited Kingdom on three occasions through the issue of bonds. The issues were  5 million in 1951,  5 million in 1954 and  10 million in 1959.International Finance Corporation36. The International Finance Corporation is an affiliate of theInternational Bank, concerned solely with investment in private enterprisesin member countries. Its authorised capital is $100 million, and subscriptionsto this are paid entirely in gold or dollars by member countries on joining.The United Kingdom&apos;s subscription of $14-4 million was paid during1956-57, and is included in Table I.Proposed International Development Association37. It has been proposed that an International Development Associationshould be established, with initial resources of $1,000 million, as a close
affiliate-of. the International Bank, to supplement its lending operations.Her Majesty&apos;s Government have given this proposal full encouragementfrom the start and have announced that if the proposal proceeds they will seek the approval of Parliament for a United Kingdom contribution of about 50 million towards the initial resources of the Association.United Nations38. The United Kingdom contributes to the United Nations ExpandedProgramme of Technical Assistance and to the United Nations Special Fund.Her Majesty&apos;s Government have announced that the contribution to theExpanded Programme for 1960 has been increased from $2 - 24 million to $3 million and to the Special Fund from $1 million to $5 million. these increases are not reflected in the figures for 1959-60.. 39. Most of the work of the United Nations specialised agencies is inthe less developed countries of the world. The Food and AgriculturalOrganisation advises on agriculture, forests and fisheries and provides expertsand assistance in these fields and for the improvement of distribution. TheWorld Health Organisation assists countries to strengthen and improve theirhealth services by providing visiting consultants, public health experts,demonstration teams for disease control; the organisation also providesadvisory services to its members. The United Nations Educational, scientific and Cultural Organisation seeks to broaden the basis of world education andto increase mutual understanding; it assists countries to institute primary,secondary and technical education services, provides fellowships and promotesinternational exchanges. The International Labour Organisation aims atraising the standards of living by setting labour and social standards and byaiding countries to achieve social progress through technical assistance andby the distribution of information of social and economic interest. TheInternational Atomic Energy Authority seeks to spread the knowledge of atomic energy for peaceful purposes to enable countries to use atomic powerto improve their standards of living; the Authority provides material,equipment and facilities for training to this end.40. The United Nations Children&apos;s Fund (UN1CEF) is a voluntaryfund devoted to the welfare of mothers and children, to which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will contribute  335,000 in 1960, an increase of  100,000 over their contribution for 1959. The Fund works largely through the specialised agencies which carry out programmes of aid and instruction in the fieki ofhealth nutrition and general welfare.41. Figures showing the United Kingdom subscription to theseinternational agencies are included in Table II above;AID IN RELATION TO UNITED KINGDOM RESOURCES42. This paper has shown that assistance from United KingdomGovernment funds to less developed territories has risen from about  80million in 1957-58 to over  140 million in 1959-60.   Including private
investment of about  100 million approximately 1  per cent.* of the national income of the United Kingdom goes to benefit the less developed countries.Since the war the total amount devoted to those countries from UnitedKingdom sources in the form of private investment or Government assistancehas been some  2,500 million.43. The United Kingdom therefore has a creditable record amongst themore industrially advanced countries who are sharing the responsibility ofproviding finance for the social and economic progress of the rest. Thereis an urgent need to continue, and if possible increase this effort. In so faras this assistance comes from the Exchequer, it is a cost to the British peoplewhich is borne because of the need it meets and the benefit it brings. But itcannot be provided at all unless the economy of the United Kingdom itselfcontinues to develop on sound lines. The export trade will need to expandat a rate sufficient to provide an adequate margin of funds to be used for overseas assistance without calling on the gold and foreign currency reserves.The expansion of consumption out of the United Kingdom&apos;s rising productionmust not exceed a rate which leaves sufficient goods available for this increase in exports, and the general level of prices here will have to be such that overseas orders for these additional goods will be readily obtainable.* This and other figures given in the present paper are on a different basis fromthose in paper Cmnd. 237-The United Kingdom&apos;s Role in Commonwealth Development-because they exclude investment in certain Commonwealth countries which do notrank as less developed but include amounts spent in such countries outside theCommonweatlh.
