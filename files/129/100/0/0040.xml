Printed for the Cabinet. March I960C. (60) 404th February, I960CABINETCOUNCIL ON PRICES, PRODUCTIVITY AND INCOMESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer wish to consult my colleagues about the future of the Council on Prices,Productivity and Incomes.2. There were some hopes last autumn that the Council might, whenreorganised, serve more fully its original purpose of an independent and impartialbody of high standing, whose advice and guidance particularly on the inter-dependence of productivity, prices and incomes would command respectthroughout the community. There was a possibility also that it might become in course of time the body which could indicate with authority what general increaseof wages would be compatible with the anticipated advances in national productivity(i.e., the so-called &quot; guiding light&quot;). But Ministers felt that it would be useful tohave the views of industry on the future of the Council before any decision wastaken.3. My colleagues will remember that from the beginning the Trades union council (T.U.C.) adopted an attitude of hostile detachment, particularly after thefirst report of the Council. More recently the T.U.C. has still declined to give theCouncil any sort of formal endorsement, and they are likely to maintain thatattitude, even though their active hostility to the Council has been modified. Amongemployers&apos; associations there was at first a good deal of reserve about the usefulnessof the Council. But the second and third reports commanded more general acceptance and the Federation of British Industries indicated a few months ago thatthey hoped the Council could be continued because they felt that its reports hadhelped to bring home to many in the community the risks of inflation in thecircumstances of near full employment and the need for restraint if price stabilitywere to be achieved.4. Thus, from the standpoint of acceptability, the present position of theCouncil can probably be said to be better than at any other time. But a cynic might say that that was because it had done nothing for a long time. Indeed thechairmanship has been vacant since last summer. It has been very difficult indeedto find someone of the requisite standing and experience, and with the rightqualities of judgment and impartiality, who would be willing and who would havethe time to undertake the responsibility of the chairmanship. I have had two orthree refusals from people who would have been suitable and although I now have in sight someone who would be quite a good chairman and whom I could probablypersuade to take the appointment he would not in any event be able to begin workuntil September.5. All this has made me reflect further on the question of whether, despitewhat is said in the latter part of paragraph 3, the Council is still needed or whetherit would not now be right to let it die. On the whole I have now come to the viewthat the second course would be best. I think that to discontinue the Council while no doubt to do so would expose us to some complacent levity on the part of theOpposition would not bring into question the importance which the Governmentattaches to price stability. (Indeed, on this point, for us to keep the Council in being but in effect to have it continue in complete inaction until September wouldCopy No. 5756654
not carry much conviction of any urgency or importance about its work and i cannot hold out any hope of being able to find an alternative Chairman in theperiod before September.) But my main reason for thinking that we might do best- to discontinue the Council now rests in my belief that to a substantial extent it has done all a Council so constituted can do in this field. Their work was, in my view,largely educational inculcating a greater awareness among industrialists and othersofy^e interdependence of prices, profits and wages and arousing a greaterconsciousness of the risks of inflation in circumstances of near-full employment,unless policies of conscious restraint were followed.. I would not wish to imply thatthose lessons had been fully learned by all sections of the community, but I would think that public awareness of the issue involved was much greater now than wasthe case two or three years ago. And I am not sure that a revived Council wouldbe able to find things to say and report on which would either throw new light onthe basic problem or bring it home more effectively to men&apos;s business and bosoms.Certainly I would not find it easy to suggest new and relevant lines of study for theCouncil. I fear therefore that much of their effort would inevitably be repetitiveof that of Lord Cohen and his colleagues and would therefore not perhaps makea marked impact on the community.6.   The disappearance of the Council would no doubt mean that theGovernment will have to be prepared to show itself more ready to give positiveguidance on these matters: but that is a separate issue on which I shall wish tovconsult my colleagues further.7. The future of the Council was discussed at the meeting of the economic policy Committee on 2nd March, and in the light of the considerations set outin the preceding paragraphs, the general view of the Committee was that on balanceit would be desirable to bring the Council to an end. I now seek the approval ofthe Cabinet to this course. If this is to be our decision I would suggest that weshould explain it by means of a pre-arranged question and answer (written) in theHouse, on the lines of the attached draft.Q. Whether he is now in a position to make a statement about the future ofthe Council on Prices, Productivity and Incomes.A. Yes, Sir. I have been giving much thought to this question. The council was set up in August 1957 with terms of reference which required it, having regardto the desirability of full employment and increasing standards of life based onexpanding production and reasonable stability of prices, to keep under reviewchanges in prices, productivity and the level of incomes (including wages, salaries and profits) and to report thereon from time to time.The Council&apos;s three reports have been of much value in inculcating in thecommunity a greater awareness of the interdependence of prices, profits,productivity and incomes, and of the crucial importance of price stability. I amyery grateful to Lord Cohen and his colleagues for their work and for what they.have done to promote public recognition of the basic causes and dangers of inflation. Given what has been achieved, the Government have come to theconclusion that the Council has now done as much as a body of this kind can doin this field in present circumstances and that its functions should therefore for thepresent at any rate be suspended. I must emphasise, however, that the fundamentalissues discussed in the Councils reports have lost none of their significance forus all.D. H.
