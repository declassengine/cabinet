It will be remembered that a basic condition of theLondon Agreements was that we should retain two areas as military bases under full British sovereignty.2,        To serve as military bases,  the Sovereign Areas must beof sufficient size to include existing military installations;to accommodate reinforcements in an emergency;    to includeadequate water sources;    and to provide some &quot;elbow room&quot; for future expansion,  new installations, and for installationswhich are, at present, outside the proposed Sovereign Areas.3,       At the time of the London Conference,  it was thought thatit would be necessary to retain areas in which about 16,000Cypriots resided, amounting to about 170 square miles.    Wewere told that the Cypriots were much more concerned about thenumber of Cypriots who would be within the Sovereign Areasthan about the actual size of the Sovereign Areas.    Our firstformal statement&apos;of our requirements related to an area of152 square miles,  including a Cypriot population of only4,500.    There are no grounds for regarding an area of this size, which represents about 4,1 per cent of the total area of cyprus, as in any way extravagant.The 122 square mile proposals.       By drastically pruning our requirements,we then agreedto reduce the areas to a total of 122 square miles.    this represented a reduction of about 20 per cent with a consequent increase in the area ceded to the Republic of Cyprus from95.9 per cent to 96,6 per cent of the total area of the island.5.       The Archbishop&apos;s present proposal that we should limit the total area of the sovereign bases to 80 square miles wouldmean a reduction of our requirement as first formally stated by about one-half and a reduction of our drastically prunedrequirement, by one-third.    The effect on the Republic of cyprus would be to increase the proportion of the total areaof the island ceded to them from 96.6 per cent to 97.8 per cent.The final reduction to 105 square miles6,       There is no reasonable case for further reducing the total-1-
size of the sovereign base areas below 122 square miles.Nevertheless, if,  for political reasons,  it is considered necessary to make some further concession to the Archbishop, Ibelieve that we could reduce the total area to about 105 square miles without it being quite plain that the sovereign baseareas would no longer meet our essential military requirements.This further reduction could only he achieved by a number ofsmall reductions in various parts of the areas, all of whichwould mean a further sacrifice of &quot;elbow room&quot;.    these reductions,  in descending order of acceptability,  comprise thefollowing (see attached maps):-square miles(a) west of Athna 1.56(b) north of Episkopi 11.32(c) north and south-west of Pergamos 1.93(d) north of Akrotiri Salt Lake 2.0016.81This further reduction is,  from a military point of view,  neitherreasonable nor prudent and can only be regarded as acceptableif it is the necessary price of obtaining a settlement of the cyprus problem.    Even so, we could only give up this furtherarea on the understanding that we should retain in it all thefacilities we might require.    This figure will need a good dealof explanation to the House of Commons.7,       To reduce the size of the sovereign areas to the archbishop&apos;s figure of 80 square miles would mean a further reduction of 25 square miles,  that is to say a further reductionby about one-quarter below the figure which I,and my military advisers regard as the absolute minimum.    If we made this reduction,  it could no longer be claimed that the British sovereiareas would meet our essential military requirements.    When we came to operate the bases, this would become painfully evidentand would lead to constant friction with the Cypriotauthorities.conclusion.       What matters about the final settlement of the base areas is whether we can defend it as still making good military sense.We cannot further squeeze the area and make this claim.    WhilstI reluctantly agree that if we can clinch an agreement withthe Cypriots we should reduce the size of the sovereign areas to 105 square miles or thereabouts in accordance with theproposals set out above,  I ask my colleagues to agree thatany further reduction would not he acceptable either on military or on political grounds.h.W.Ministry of Defence,  S.W.I.7th March,  1960.-2-
