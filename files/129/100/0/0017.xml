confidential this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   February I960C. (60) 17 Copy No.   6 45th February, I960 -CABINETPRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES: EUROPEAN FREE TRADEASSOCIATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsArticle 35 (1) of the European Free Trade Association Convention requires that a Protocol should lay down the legal capacity, privileges and immunities to berecognised and granted by Member States in connexion with the Association.2. I propose that the scale of immunities and privileges should be as outlined in the Annex. They have been carefully considered in relation both to the precedents existing in the cases of other international organisations (particularly the specialised Agencies of the United Nations) and also to the provision of whatseems necessary to ensure the effective operation of the European Free trade association (E.F.T.A.). This would be within the limits imposed by theInternational Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950. An Order inCouncil would therefore be sufficient to give effect in the United Kingdom to a protocol granting such a scale.3. If this is agreed, the draft Protocol which has been submitted by the ForeignOffice to the Working Party on Privileges and Immunities of the Steering Committeeon International Organisations for their comments would be communicated to ourE.F.T.A. partners. We should then seek to secure our E.F.T.A. partners&apos;agreement to it.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,5th February, 1960.56493
