(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 49 COPY NO.15th March, I960CABINETTHE CROWTHER report memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Home DepartmentIntroductionThe Education Policy Committee have now considered themain recommendations of a report of the Central Advisory council for Education (England) under the chairmanship of Sir Geoffrey Crowtherand with the agreement of the Minister of Education the Secretary ofState for Scotland and my other colleagues concerned I submit for theapproval of the Cabinet the Committee&apos;s conclusions.   The report is to be debated in the House of Commons on 21st March and in theHouse of Lords on 23rd March.   Paragraphs 8-11 below give the line which it is proposed should be taken by the Education Ministers.2. The report, which is closely reasoned and lucidly presented,has made a considerable impact upon public opinion and has been widelyacclaimed for its boldness and vision.   It amounts, in the words of itsauthors, to&quot;a consistent programme for the development, during thenext twenty years or so, of English education for young people between the ages of 15 and 18.   V/e cannot in conscienceadvise that anything less is necessary if the nationaleducational system is to meet the requirements of thistumultuous and dynamic century&quot;.3. The recommendations which have aroused the greatestinterest and are the most likely to be used by the Opposition as a test of our good intentions are that we should;-(i) re-affirm the principle of compulsory full-time educationup to the age of sixteen, and announce now that we will raise the again 1966, 1967 or 1968;(ii) re-affirm the principle that there should be compulsorypart-time education up to the age of eighteen for all those not at school,and undertake to introduce county colleges for this purpose within four or five years of the raising of the school leaving age.Both these principles are embodied in the Education Act of 1944 and sowe are being asked to agree to a programme that will fully implement the Act.-1-CONFIDENTIAL
The supply of teachers4. The most pressing need of the education service today isa reduction in the size of classes.   We are committed to this by theEducation Act of 1944, by repeated declarations of policy since 1951,and by pledges given in the General Election that over-size classeswould be eliminated by 1965.5. However we strain effort or resources we must realise that we cannot easily carry out these pledges.   If we were to provideno more training college places, we could not fulfil them even in the life of the next Parliament, and we could only raise the age if we wereprepared to see three-quarters of a million children still in over-sizeclasses.6. If we put in hand now the provision of 8,000 extra places,then we can either eliminate over-size classes, or put ourselves ina position to raise the school leaving age by 1970, without an intolerableslowing down of the process of reducing class sizes.7. More generally, we should, for the first time since the war,gain the initiative in teacher supply and be able to meet further demands upon it (including those from the Commonwealth), which all past experience suggests we should expect.8. These additional places would involve a capital cost ofabout  12. 5 millions spread over four years starting in 1962, and are current annual expenditure of about  4. 5 millions from 1965.It is estimated that without the additional places the total bill for education will, as a result of our existing policies, be increasedby about 50 per cent by 1969-70:  the cost of the new places and of the teachers who would emerge from them would add to this a further to 2 per cent.   About two-thirds of all this expenditure would fallon the Exchequer.9. The Committee on Education Policy are satisfied that theseproposals are realistic and justified, whatever decision is taken onraising the leaving age, and recommend their approval.The raising of the school leaving age10. The Committee accept that we should re-affirm theprinciple of compulsory full-time education up to the age of sixteenand that we should announce now that we therefore propose to intensifythe campaign to recruit more teachers and to expand the training colleges by 8,000 places.   This expansion will also enable us beforethe end of this Parliament to make a decision about the school leaving age.   In the meantime, we should do all we can to encourage voluntarystaying on at school.   We should say that the year from 15 to 16 willfor some boys and possibly girls be better spent in a full-time course in a technical college rather than in a school.-2-
Compulsory part-time education in county colleges11. On this the Committee consider that changes in social conditions since the war, the earlier maturity of boys and girls andthe great increase in voluntary attendance at part-time day classeshave significantly altered the situation.      They expect that developmentsduring the next ten years or so will accentuate those changes.12. The Committee also consider that the development since1956 of local colleges of further education which provide all types of course for the under twenties makes it desirable to modify the objective of a complete and separate range of institutions calledcounty colleges.   If numbers in the less vocational courses growvery fast, there may be a need for some institutions wholly devotedto such classes, but, in general, the Committee consider that thelocal colleges of further education (of which 300 are already available)form a natural focus for the development of &quot;County College&quot; work.Together with village colleges (on the Cambridgeshire model), youthclubs, Outward Bound schools, short residential courses, etc. , therewill then be available a wide variety of opportunities for further education on a voluntary basis to catch the imagination of the modernteenager.13. In the light of these developments Her Majesty&apos;s government consider it desirable to re-assess the Original conception of CountyColleges when we are nearer achieving the objectives set out in theearlier paragraphs of this paper.   Further when progress has beenmade on the lines of paragraphs 11 and 12, a fresh look on the compulsory aspects of the original plan may be desirable.   Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment think that meanwhile we should do all we can to developpart-time education on a voluntary basis and that we should examinewith industry and the local education authorities the possibility of introducing legislation to give the young worker a right to claim releaseon one day a week for this purpose.Presentation of Government1 s decisions14. By these decisions we should be coming close to rejectingCrowther&apos;s two main recommendations, set out in paragraph 3 above -and so laying ourselves open to the charge of not implementing the1944 Act.   We must therefore be seen, as a first and essential step,to be acting with vigour to eliminate over-size classes.R. A. B.Hom-e- Office, S. W. 1.15th March, I960
