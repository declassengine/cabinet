Report on Defence 1960POLICY1. The policy of the Government, in co-operation with our Allies, js toprevent war. Disarmament under satisfactory controls is the best means of achieving this end, but we do not intend to drop our defensive guard untilpractical results show that comprehensive disarmament can be secured.2. During the third year of the Five-year Plan for Defence, theGovernment^ broad defence policy has undergone no major change. our task must still be to contribute in the most efficient and effective way possible,with our allies, to the maintenance of world peace. Our Defence effort mustbe flexible, since the threat of war takes many and changing forms, and itmust be expected that there will be shifts of emphasis from time to time tomeet changing circumstances.KEEPING THE PEACE3. This country makes an important contribution to the preservation ofpeace by strengthening the nuclear power of the West. This is only onecomponent of the deterrent. Because of the need to meet local emergencieswhich could develop into a major conflict, conventionally armed forces area necessary complement to nuclear armaments. In short, the deterrent to aggresion must be comprehensive.4. Against the continuing Communist military threat, the corner-stone ofthe defence of the free world is a complex of collective security alliances.Great Britain plays her part in NATO, CENTO and SEATO, and in additionprovides a military presence to help preserve stability in politically sensitiveareas for which she has a particular responsibility. The maps on the centrepages show how these alliances interlock and how the United Kingdomparticipates in them as part of our world wide military responsibilities. Themaintenance of the strength of these alliances is a vital part of our defence effort.5. Our concern for maintaining the strength of this country&apos;s contributionto NATO and our other alliances has recently been shown by the decisions ofthe Government to retain for the time being seven Brigade Groups in theBritish Army of the Rhine, [and to defer the withdrawal of certain fighter squadrons from R.A.F. Germany.]5SECRET56419 c*
THE HUMAN FACTOR6. By the end of the current Five-year Defence Programme Britain willhave reduced her Service manpower from nearly 700,000 to around 400,000.In the smaller all-regular forces, the individual will have to work, train andfight at maximum efficiency. To enable him to do this, he must be provided with conditions in which he can give of his best. He must be well paid and well housed, and his services must be efficiently and economicallydirected.Technical Requirements and Training7. Weapons inevitably become more complex as their power and efficiency increase. This trend is illustrated by the greater demand uponelectrical supplies now made by the ancillary equipment fitted in aircraft,tanks and ships. Whereas a Wellington bomber of the last war needed some5 kilowatts of electrical power for this equipment, a modern V-bomber needsabout 140 kilowatts. The Matilda tank had a f kilowatt generator: thelatest Centurion has a 3 kilowatt generator with a separate engine to drive it.The new aircraft carrier H.M.S. Hermes is capable of generating twice asmuch electrical power as the wartime aircraft carrier H.M.S. Illustrious: theair defence system of the Hermes contains some 9,000 valves as against lessthan 500 in the air warning system of Illustrious. Increases such as these in the energy requirements of our aircraft, tanks and ships are essentially ameasure of the technical developments that have occurred over the past10 years in radar, automatic control and fire power.8. There is thus, a greater need than at any previous time for the men andwomen who service, maintain and operate these equipments to possessscientific and technical knowledge and skill. The Services have accordinglygreatly improved their training resources. Each year, about 200 officers andofficer cadets are being sent on courses of degree standard in science and engineering the equivalent of about 25 per cent, of the total annual officercadet entry. In the last five years, the proportion of highly skilled tradesmenin the total strength of the Army and the RAF. has gone up by 50 per cent.The 2,000 places which were available in Army apprentice schools in 1948have been increased to 3,200, and will build up to 4,000 by mid-1962.9. An important consequence of this spread of scientific and technical qualifications in the Services is that retiring servicemen can command betteremployment in civilian life, and consequently contribute more to the national wealth.Manpower Economy10. Work study and allied techniques are in use on an increasing scale in all three Services. Such progress has been made that the United states navy have sent work study teams for training at the Royal Naval WorkStudy School at Portsmouth.11. Widespread results are being obtained. Studies in aircraft servicingin Bomber Command have increased aircraft availability by 10 per cent, and
resulted in much higher utilisation of manpower. The time taken to refuel,reload and check a Hunter aircraft in Fighter Command has been cut by half,and the number of men required reduced from nine to six. In the royal navy, improvements in the system of power loading of torpedoes insubmarines has reduced the time required by over a third. Work study ofthe repair of wireless sets in an Army workshop has increased productivityby a half without any addition of staff.The Women&apos;s Services12. A number of jobs in the operation of control equipments are particularly suitable for women. In addition, women are now employed on many tasks in the Services traditionally done by men; women are working,for example, as skilled vehicle mechanics, airframe mechanics, engineerdraughtsmen and instrument makers. By releasing men for more active dutiesthey are making an essential contribution to efficiency.Pay and Pensions13. The Advisory Committee on Recruiting recommended in 1958, andthe Government agreed, that there should be an automatic biennial review of pay and pensions which would take into account movements in civilianearnings. The first review has been completed and the results have been announced in Cmnd.Officer Career Structures14. Another recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Recruitingwas that the career structure of officers should be redesigned so that, as faras possible, they should have the choice of retirement before 40 or employment to 60 or so.15. The changes in career structure and improvement in retired payalready announced in Parliament go a long way towards meeting thisrecommendation. The Government regard these as a reform of majorsignificance for the future of the Services.16. The success achieved in resettling the many thousands of officers who have retired since the introduction of the Five-year Defence Plan should give much encouragement to those officers who may leave before they are 40.Service Accommodation17. At home about  19 million is expected to be spent in the coming financial year on new accommodation and houses for Service families,compared with about  10 million during each of the last two years. Duringthe current financial year some 800 new married quarters, and barracks forsome 3,600 men, will have been completed, in addition to extensiveimprovements to existing premises. In the next twelve months a further8,000 houses and new barrack accommodation for some 21,000 men will be under construction.564197SECRETc* 2
18. Overseas, a substantial building programme is being pressed forward. In the past year, nearly  6 million has been spent on workwhich includes about 400 new houses and modern barrack accommodation for some 1,500 single men and women. In the coming year, expenditure on overseas building is expected to total some  10 million. Major projects dueto be completed include a substantial part of the Malacca cantonment, some200 married quarters in Kenya, and single accommodation for nearly 1,500men, some 270 new houses and two new schools in Aden. Other major projects under construction during 1960 will be living accommodation for troops and families in Cyprus and Kenya, 120 flats and houses in Gibraltar,and improvements to existing accommodation in Libya.19. New ships for the Royal Navy will incorporate modern standards ofliving accommodation. These are also being introduced as far as possibleinto other ships of the active Fleet.Recruiting20. In 1959, the number of recruits on long-term engagements was 45,000.This compares with 47,000 in 1958, which was an exceptionally good year.If the 1959 rate continues, the strength of the forces will be a little under400,000 at the beginning of 1963.The Future of the Services21. Whatever changes may come about in Defence policy as the resultof either technical developments or disarmament, the Government cannotforesee a time when this country will not need highly trained professionalforces to play our part in world affairs. In a more peaceful world, these forces might eventually take on a wider international role, but the need forthem will remain.WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT22. The strength of the all-regular forces will lie not so much in their numbers but in their ability to act quickly and decisively wherever they are needed. They have, therefore, to be armed with weapons and equipment which are highly mobile and second to none in quality. Some examples of equipment now in service or coming into service are given in the following paragraphs.23. The weapons of the future will depend on research work now inprogress. For example, the problems of high-speed flight and kinetic heatingare being studied with the help of the Bristol 188 stainless steel aircraft,which will make its first flight soon; the Short S.C. 1 research aircraft and the hawker P. 1127 are being used to investigate vertical take-off; and theproblems of defence against ballistic missiles are also being examined. Allthe first five firings of the research rocket Black Knight have been successful.
24. In all defence research work the Government^ Research andDevelopment Establishments play a large part. They are excellently equipped and staffed by scientists and engineers of the highest quality. The maintenanceof the strength of these establishments is a vital feature of our defence plan.Land25. The development of the new main battle tank is well up to schedule.This tank will incorporate several new principles of design and promises to beas outstanding in its class as is its predecessor, the Centurion. A series of newmulti-fuel vehicle engines which promises great economy and flexibility inperformance has been demonstrated at the Armoured Fighting VehiclesResearch Establishment at Chobham.26. The new 105-mm. tank gun is about to be issued to units, and hasalready been ordered in quantity by the United States and Sweden.27. The Australian designed and produced Malkara has been adopted as the first anti-tank guided missile of the British forces. This is a fineexample of co-operation within the Commonwealth.28. The Canadian Beaver has been chosen as a light liaison aircraft insupport of the Army.29. In accordance with the policy of NATO interdependence in armsdevelopment and production, the Italian 105-mm. pack howitzer hassuccessfully undergone trials for acceptance by the British Army and a production order is being placed.30. In anti-aircraft defence, Thunderbird Mark I has been adopted as theArmy&apos;s first surface-to-air weapon and is now coming into service.Sea31. The first of the Tiger Class cruisers has joined the Fleet. She isarmed with 6-inch and 3-inch guns which are a great advance in bothaccuracy and fire power in the non-nuclear field.32. The building programme of conventional submarines of advanceddesign is continuing. The keel of the nuclear-propelled submarine H.M.S.Dreadnought was laid by His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh last june, and an order for the first all-British nuclear submarine is expected to beplaced in the coming year.33. The aircraft carrier H.M.S. Eagle is being modernised. The new aircraft carrier H.M.S. Hermes, equipped with the latest air defence andcontrol arrangements, is about to join the fleet.34. At the same time, the striking power of the Fleet has been greatlyincreased by the entry into service of the Scimitar single-seat day fighter/,
strike aircraft and the Sea Vixen two-seat all-weather fighter armed withFirestreak missiles. A production order has been placed for the N.A. 39,which promises to be an outstanding strike aircraft.35. Trials of Seaslug, our main ship-to-air guided weapon, and Seacat,our ship-to-air low-level weapon, have continued successfully. Theconstruction of the County class ships which will carry Seaslug is proceedingwell.Air36. The V-bomber force remains the United Kingdom&apos;s main contributionto the strategic nuclear power of the West. The improved engines of the mark II Vulcan and the Mark II Victor will give these new aircraft bettertake-off performances and will allow them to fly further and at greater heights.Arrangements for refuelling in flight will increase their range still further.The readiness of bombers in this country will be improved and their dispersalincreased, and measures will be taken to make it operationally easier to deploythem overseas. Supplementing the V-bombers is the Thor missile which hasjoined the operational front line of the R.A.F. during the year. arrangements are being made with the United States Authorities which will provide aballistic missile warning system for this country.37. One of the aims of research and development in the field of the strategic deterrent is to devise a means of delivery that is invulnerable to the opposing defences. The development of the British ballistic missile blue streak is continuing. However, it may be decided not to rely exclusivelyon fixed-site missiles as the successor to the medium bomber armed with the stand-off powered bomb. Therefore the possibilities of mobile launchers,whether aircraft or submarines, for long-range delivery of nuclear warheadsare being investigated.38. Considerable progress has been made with the detailed design ofthe T.S.R. 2 aircraft for the strike and reconnaissance role.39. The Lightning supersonic fighter is now being flown by R.A.F. pilots and will enter regular squadron service within the next few months.40. Development work is proceeding on a trainer version of this aircraft and it has reached the stage of being flown. The Gnat trainer is being developed for advanced jet training.41. The surface-to-air guided weapon Bloodhound is being deployed in service with the R.A.F. This weapon is also being adopted by the Australianforces, and by Sweden, as their surface-to-air guided weapon.42. Throughout the programme of development of guided weapons, the range at Woomera in Australia, operated as a joint project by the australian and United Kingdom Governments, has been indispensable. It has been usedfor testing Firestreak, Thunderbird, Bloodhound, Seaslug, Malkara, BlueSteel, Blue Water, and the research vehicles Black Knight and Skylark.
Mobility43. Rapid mobility has become of the greatest importance, so thatreinforcements can be brought to trouble spots before the trouble has timeto spread into a major conflict.44. The military version of the Britannia went into squadron service inR.A.F. Transport Command during the past year, and a second squadron willhave come into service by the end of 1960. The strategic force will be furtherstrengthened in due course by deliveries of the Britannic, for which an order is being negotiated, to carry exceptionally heavy or bulky freight. the tactical transport force will be fortified when deliveries of the military version,of the Argosy, now on order, begin. A contract has been placed for thedevelopment of the Rotodyne, and a production contract is being negotiated.There is little doubt that this aircraft can have great value as a specialisedtactical transport. In addition, helicopters are to be provided for the quickmovement of troops within the tactical area; Whirlwinds will meet part ofthis need, and deliveries of a new order will begin next year; a more advancedtype will be developed for the balance of the requirement.45. Another means of moving troops to the scene of trouble is thecommando carrier, which is now coming into service. The commandocarrier Bulwark has just joined the Fleet. She is designed to carry OneRoyal Marine Commando equivalent to an infantry battalion together withhelicopters, landing craft and vehicles to enable the commando to land acrossbeaches and operate well inland. It can be sustained with supplies fromthe carrier for several weeks. She is fully air-conditioned and can maintain a commando at instant readiness for long periods in any area where troublemay threaten.   She will normally be deployed east of Suez.new organisation for supply46. The principal purpose of the creation of the Ministry of Aviationwas to bring together under one Minister all the Governments responsibilities for civil aviation and for the supply of both civil and military aircraft. Thenew Ministry has also been given responsibility for the supply of guided weapons, including ballistic missiles, of much radar and other electronicequipment, and of nuclear weapons.47. Responsibility for the supply of other warlike stores needed by theArmy (for example, guns, tanks, ammunition) and for general equipment,such as vehicles and uniforms, has reverted to the Secretary of State for War.He has become responsible for most of the Royal Ordnance Factories.48. Certain scientific establishments have also been transferred to theWar Office along with the functions to which they are related. Every careis being taken to ensure that the scientific and technical resources, and the unity of professional staffs, which have been progressively developed over recent years are preserved under the new arrangements.
THE ALLIANCES WITHIN THE FREE WORLD
PRINCIPAL BRITISHDEFENSE COMMITMENTS
INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION49. If we are to maintain the efficiency of our defensive alliances at abearable cost, then we must make the best use of the scientific and industrial resources of the free world. It is the Governments wish to promote a widermeasure of co-operation in defence research, development and production,both in the Commonwealth and in Europe. Such a policy means the closestco-operation with America in both these spheres. There are, of course, many difficulties to be overcome, but such a policy would do much to holdtogether the pattern of free world alliances, and, by bringing about mutualdependence, increase the extent to which decisions on armaments are deter-mined by international discussions.CIVIL DEFENCE50. The main task for civil defence remains that of maintaining and developing the existing organisation and resources as a framework for further expansion if that should ever be necessary. Progress has been made, andwill continue, with essential research, the provision of up-to-date equipment,the strengthening of communications and the development of the warningand monitoring system; and a start will be made with the prodxiction ofadditional public warning devices.51. Some 142,000 volunteers have been recruited for the Civil DefenceCorps during the last three years. About 130,000 members have gone fromthe Corps over the same period, but this was largely the result of the removal from the registers of the inactive and untrained. Particularly encouragingis the progress that has been made in the recruitment and training of volunteerswith scientific qualifications to act as Scientific Intelligence Officers.52. Close co-operation between the Services and the civil defenceauthorities continues at all levels. Under the arrangements announced in lastyear&apos;s Defence White Paper, a number of major Territorial Army units havebeen trained in civil defence techniques and by the end of the year half the designated units will have received this specialised training.THE DEFENCE BUDGET53. Before deducting expected receipts of  12 million from the federal republic of Germany, the Defence Estimates for 1960-61 amount to 1,629 - 83 million. This is some  115-7 million higher than the Estimates for1959-60. This increase is in part due to an extension of the scope of theDefence Budget to include certain expenditure hitherto borne on Civil Votes.Further details of the Defence Budget in statistical form are in the Appendix.
Current division of expend!-ture on manpower, research and development;MANPOWERRESEARCH ANDDEVELOPMENTPRODUCTION,etc.Manpower 49 per cent.   Research and Development 14 per cent.Production etc. 37 per cent.54.   The Defence Budget is divided up in the following way:  id) nearly half the Defence Budget is spent directly on Service personnel and civilians working with the forces-some of these civiliansdoing work which is purely civilian in type, and some doing workfor which otherwise servicemen would have to be recruited. Thesecosts cover pay, allowances, retired pay, food, clothing, housing and transportation. In 1960-61 they will amount to 49 per cent, of thewhole. The cost per head has tended to rise, and is likely to risefurther, partly because of the change to all-regular forces, and partly because the standard of life in this country is rising;(b) 14 per cent, (in 1960-61) goes on the research and development of the weapons of the future;(c) of the balance (37 per cent, in 1960-61), the greater part (28 per cent,in 1960-61) goes on the procurement of weapons and equipment foruse now. This represents what the Service Departments pay in cashduring the financial year, mainly for weapons, equipment and stores
delivered to them in the period. In addition to these deliveries, largenew commitments have continually to be met by orders which must be implemented over several years. The remainder (9 per cent, in1960-61) is miscellaneous expenditure which is a function partly ofmen, partly of activity, training or action, partly of equipment; andpartly it is overheads. It covers such items as storage, operationalworks, fuel for aircraft and ships and so forth.55. Looking at the Defence Budget in this way, it can be seen what alarge part of it is spent on services which cannot be curtailed at short notice.56. A principal aim of the Five-year Defence Plan introduced in 1957was to give stability to the Defence programme and so to avoid wastage both of effort and expenditure. This remains the Governments policy. None the less,adjustments in long-term plans cannot be avoided in a world in which therate of progress of science and technology is always accelerating and in whichthe international scene is constantly changing. The problem of reconciling the need for stability with changing requirements is seen in its most acuteform in the Defence sphere.
APPENDIXDEFENCE STATISTICS, 1960-61Manpower1. An analysis of the active strengths of the three Services is given in annex I, Table 1.2. In 1960-61 the armed forces will need about 84,000 male entrants.This figure includes men called up for national service, those who enter uponregular engagements and those who enter as boys, apprentices and juniors.Of this total, some 32,000 will come, either regulars or national servicemen,from the age groups liable for call-up for national service in the calendar year 1960. These will be divided among the three Services approximately asfollows:  Royal Navy: 250.Army: 24,800.Royal Air Force: 7,000.3. An analysis of the volunteer reserve and auxiliary forces and nationalservice reserves for the three Services is given in Annex I, Table 2.finance. The estimated cost of the Defence programme, before taking intoaccount the German contribution towards local costs of British forces inGermany, is:    million(a) as estimated for 1959-60   ............      1,514-13(See Annex II to Defence Statistics, 1959-60)(b) as estimated for 1960-61    ............      1,629-835. In 1960-61 the German contribution towards local costs of british forces in Germany will be the Deutschmark equivalent of  12 million and thishas been appropriated in aid of Army and Air Votes. This will be the lastyear in which such a contribution will be received.6. The estimated cost of the Defence programme after deducting receipts from Germany for 1959-60 and 1960-61 is thus:  (a) as estimated for 1959-60: 1,514-13 million less  12 million- 1,502 13 million;(b) as estimated for 1960-61: 1,629-83 million less  12 million - 1,617-83 million.
7. The division between Departments for 1960-61 and the comparablefigures for 1959-60 are shown below:  Before deducting receipts from Germany  million	Original Estimate	Estimate	1959-60	1960-61Admiralty      ......	370-70	397-50War Office     ......	441-35	487-45Air Ministry......	492-80	529-46Ministry of Supply  ...	191-80	Ministry of Aviation ...	 	198-85Ministry of Defence ...	17-48	16-57	1,514-13	1,629-83After deducting receipts from Germany in		accordance with paragraph 6 (a) and (b)			  million		1959-60	1960-61Admiralty      ......	370-70	397-50War Office     ......	431-35	477-45Air Ministry......	490-80	527-46Ministry of Supply  ...	191-80	 Ministry of Aviation ...	 	198-85Ministry of Defence ...	17-48	16-57	1,502-13	1,617-83An analysis of the 1960-61 Estimates is at Annex II.8. The increase of  115-7 million over last year&apos;s Estimates is due inpart to a change in the statistical basis of the Defence Budget which has been referred to in paragraph 53, as a result of which additional expenditure,amounting to about  27 million, hitherto borne on Civil Votes has been incorporated in the Defence Budget. In addition, the transfer of functionsfrom the former Ministry of Supply to the War Office has had some slightnet effect on the Defence Budget, as also has the transfer from the admiralty to the Ministry of Transport of responsibility for merchant shipbuilding and repair. The effect of all these changes may be summarised by saying that had they not taken place, Defence Estimates for 1960-61 would have stood at about  1,602 million. Had they occurred a year earlier, last year&apos;s defence estimates of  1,514-13 million would have risen to about  1,545 million.9. In the financial year 1960-61   million will be provided for defence expenditure by Civil Departments (including loan expenditure bythe Post Office) as compared with  18 48 million in the estimates for 1959-60.An analysis of the proposed expenditure is given in Annex III.
