(60) 131st February, I960CABINETTHE COST OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the-Lord chancellor the Soxial Services Committee discussed at two meetings lastweek the finances of the National Health Service.   The estimated nettcost of the Service in the current year is about  47 millions higherthan the cost in 1950/59 and the Estimates for 1960/61 already show afurther nett increase of about another  25 millions.   To this is likelyto be added a large sum resulting from the recommendations of theRoyal Commission on the remuneration of doctors and dentists in theNational Health Service, under the chairmanship of Sir Harry Filkington,and other pay awards, so that the nett cost of the Service may be foundto have increased over two years by anything from  100 to  120 millions.This figure needs to be looked at in the context of an aggregate increasein next year&apos;s Estimates of the order of  365 millions.2.   Faced with this, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has proposed thatthe National Health Service  element in the weekly contribution should at once be increased by ls.Od. (I0d on the employee and 2d. on the employer).   This would bring the employee&apos;s share   of the total contribution up to 10s. 9d. a week (2s. 0-f-d. for the Health Serviceelement).3.   As the Committee understand it, the reasons which have led theChancellor to this proposal are;-(i)   That it would yield  36 millions in the first year ( 40 millions in a full year), which would materially ease a very difficult budgetarysituation at a time when our general policy of relieving, or at leastcontaining, taxation is going to be exceptionally difficult to fulfil.(ii)   That it is important to demonstrate, from the moment the estimates are published and before the Eudget, that the Government are takingimmediate steps to meet the rising cost of the Service to the Exchequer.(iii)   That, apart from the immediate situation, it is wrong in principlethat for two years running the Exchequer should be expected to bear the whole of the increased - burden of a service whose cost must inevitably go up.-1-
4.   The Committee felt, however, great difficulty in accepting thisproposal;-(a) To increase the weekly contribution without any increase in benefitsmight release irresistible pressure for an increase in pensions whichmight otherwise have been deferred until after the new pensions schemecomes into operation in April, 1961.   Put another way, the spring of 1961is a long time to wait for fulfilment of our Election pledge that the pensioners should share in the benefits of an expanding economy, andthe political awkwardness of this would be greatly aggravated by increasing the contribution for another purpose.(b) To hypothecate to the National Health Service at this stageany part of whatever we may decide is the maximum acceptable increasein the total contribution during the next year or two would makepractically impossible any satisfactory solution to the problem of apension increase.(c) The Exchequer-borne proportion of the cost of the Service(73 per cent) is lower than ever before and to make a further increasein the Health Service contribution  (which would amount to an increaseof 300 per cent over a period of three years in which other forms of tax had been reduced) could be justified only if the financial andeconomic position of the country was at least as bad as on the occasionsof the last two increases - September, 1957 and July, 1958.(d) There was some feeling in the Committee - not, I think, shared by the Chancellor - that it would be inequitable further to increasethe contribution, which is a form of poll-tax paid not by the whole community - it is in fact paid by the working population - to finance a service which is open to all.5.   The Committee gave some consideration to the possibility of anincrease in the contribution in the context of a radical reorganisation of the financial structure of the Health Service.   On this the chancellor has proposed a system by which the distribution of the cost between theExchequer, the contributions and the charges recovered from patientsshould be in permanently fixed proportions.   This proposal raises wideand complex issues,    which the Committee are disposed to have investigated by a working party of officials.   But a change of this kind cannot be worked out and introduced in a short time and would not, therefore,help the Chancellor in his immediate difficulties.6.   In the absence of agreement in the Social Services Committee,the   Cabinet are invited to decide the question of an early increase ofIs. Od. in the National Health Service element of the weekly contribution.K.House of Lords, S. W. 1.1st February, I960-2-o
