ECONOMIC MEETINGS IN PARISMy colleagues will know that after the Western Summit Meeting in Paris astatement was issued, on 21st December, 1959, which summarised the economic discussions between the four Heads of State and Government. (The text is &quot;at annex A.)2. Following that Meeting, the four countries concerned (the United States,France, Germany and the United Kingdom) called an informal Meeting of thirteencountries who participate in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation(O.E.E.C.) Executive Committee and Steering Board for Trade with the additionof the European Economic Commission (E.E.C.). This Meeting was to considerthe need for, and methods of, continuing consultations on: problems of aid andof trade.3. The Meeting duly took place in Paris on 12th and 13th January. On the14th January I took the Chair at meetings of the 20r Governments and of theO.E.E.C. Council. (On 12th, 14th and 15th January there were also meetings ofthe Ministers of European Free Trade Area (E.F.T.A.) countries.) The UnitedKingdom was represented throughout by the President of the Board of Trade and myself. We had four days of exhausting but (in the end) not unsatisfactorydiscussions.4. These were entirely taken up with procedural issues. The moment wouldnot, in any event, have been propitious for any discussions of substance even if wehad wanted to pursue them. And although the Americans confirmed their resolveto move to fuller-participation in discussions of European economic problems(especially in their impact on wider trade issues) they were unable at this junctureto indicate whether this would have some definite new content, e.g., a fresh tariffinitiative. Clearly anything of: this kind must wait until after the United&apos;Stateselection.5. In the event, three projects were launched (by the decision on 14th Januaryof all the O.E.E.C. member-Governments plus the United States and Canada andthe E.E.C.):-(a) A New Group to Discuss Aid QuestionsThis will consist of &quot; donor &quot; countries and should be a useful body onwhich the Americans and we can, e.g., bring pressure on Germany to play a fuller role in aid. We succeeded in heading off any suggestion oLJapanesemembership, but there is provision for the possible invitation of other capitalexporting countries to participate in the work. The Americans are likely to propose that Japan should be brought into consultation in this way.(b) New Consideration of European Trade ProblemsThis is to be undertaken by working parties to be established under the aegis of the 20 Governments (O.E.E.C. members plus the United States and canada), together with the E.E.C., following on a meeting of officials whichwill probably be held in mid-March. We had great difficulties over termsof reference (which the Six wanted to be completely vague), but finallysucceeded in securing a reference to &quot; the need to examine, as a matter of priority, the relationship between the E.E.C. and the E.F.T.A. &quot;.(c) Arrangements for Review of the O.E.E.C., A working group of four officials will prepare an initial report on the adaptation (not the replacement) of the O.E.E.C. for consideration by aconference of senior officials of the 20 Governments and the european communities, to be held in April. Later on there will have to be a Ministerialconference to review full plans.6.   The texts of the three resolutions which were passed are at Annex B.
7. The continuing differences between the Six (except for the Dutch) andthe Seven were very evident, though personal relations were friendly enough.Mr. Dillon was conciliatory and helpful behind the scenes and made a most usefulspeech (particularly in its clear support for the O.E.E.C. as a live and worthwhileinstitution). Although some doubts linger in the E.F.T.A. about American motives,I feel that in the months ahead American and Canadian help is likely to be useful to us, e.g., in bringing pressure on the Six to lower their common tariff.8. Although these meetings did not take us any nearer in substance to asolution of the problem of the Six and the Seven, we can legitimately takesatisfaction from the following:  (a) The meetings helped to consolidate E.F.T.A., and there was no weakeningby any of the Seven, although some (especially Switzerland and denmark) remain very unhappy about the poor prospect for tradetalks. We were warmly thanked for our efforts on behalf of the group.There is no doubt that the creation of E.F.T.A. has been of advantage to us and the other Member Governments in these European economic questions.   Our combined voice carries greater weight.(b) We were able to collaborate effectively and pleasantly with the Americansbehind the scenes. The Americans have taken an important new initiative which, we hope, will bring them much more closely intodiscussion of economic problems in Europe. We wanted to make sure that this initiative did not get lost, or watered down, and thiswas achieved through the adoption of the three resolutions referredto above.(c) We wanted to set up a forum in which the Six-Seven problem could bediscussed as a matter of priority. This will be done in the proposedtrade committee. The fortuitously chosen committee set up as aresult of the Summit communique will cease to exist. (This will bea great advantage since there was not only much unrest among countriesnot represented on it, but the risk that it would continue as a rival tothe O.E.E.C.)(d) The much talked of aim of &quot; killing the O.E.E.C. &quot; was not realised.Mr. Dillon went out of his way in his speech to emphasise the valueof its work and the importance of doing nothing to diminish its standing in the interim period before the review is completed; and emphasis inthe review will be on strengthening and adaptation, not on replacementby a wholly new body.February, I960.
ANNEX a communique ON EUROPEAN ECONOMIC QUESTIONS,21st DECEMBER, 1959The Heads of State and Government have discussed the important changes that have taken place in the international economic situation. Recognising the greateconomic progress of Western Europe, they have agreed that virtually all of theindustrialised part of the free world is now in a position to devote its energies in increased measure to new and important tasks of co-operative endeavour with theobject of:  1(a) furthering the development of the less developed countries, and(b) pursuing trade policies directed to the sound use of economic resources andthe maintenance of harmonious international relations, thus contributing to growth and stability in the world economy and to a general improvement in the standard of living.In their view these co-operative principles should also govern the discussions on commercial problems arising from the existence of European economic, regional organisations, which are or will be constituted within the framework of the GATT,such as the European Economic Community and the European Free trade association. Their relations both with other countries and with each other shouldbe discussed in this spirit.The Heads of State and Government, recognising that the method offurthering these principles requires intensive study, have agreed to call an informalmeeting to be held in Paris in the near future. They suggest that the members andparticipants of the Executive Committee of the O.E.E.C. and the Governmentswhose nationals are members of the Steering Board for Trade of the O.E.E.C.should be represented at this meeting. It is proposed that an objective of such a group should be to consider the need for and methods of continuing consultationsdealing with the above mentioned problems.ANNEX BRESOLUTIONS BY THE SPECIAL ECONOMIC COMMITTEE,13th JANUARY, 1960, AND BY THE 20-COUNTRY COMMITTEE,14th JANUARY, 1960, SITTING IN PARISRESOLUTION ON DEVELOPMENT assistance the Special Economic CommitteeHaving been informed of the desire of the Governments of Belgium, Canada,France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United States, andthe Commission of the European Economic Community, who, in addition to their contribution to international organisations, are making available or may be in aposition to make available a significant flow of long-term funds to under-developedareas, to discuss among themselves the question of techniques to facilitate such flow of funds, taking into consideration other means of assistance to developing countries.Notes that these eight Governments and the Commission of the european economic Community intend to meet together to discuss various aspects ofco-operation in their efforts, and to invite other additional capital exporting countries to participate in their work or to meet with them as may from time totime appear desirable, and to consult with such multilateral organisations as theInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the EuropeanInvestment Bank.
