Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1960C (60) 31 Copy No.   c5722nd February, 1960CABINETREPRESENTATION OF THE VATICAN IN THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that I submitted to them on 20th January, 1959(C. (59) 8.) a copy of a letter from the Duke of Norfolk to the Prime Ministerurging the acceptance of an Internuncio (with the rank of Minister) as Vaticanrepresentative in this country, together with a memorandum summarising someof the factors that have had a bearing on this matter in the past. It was concluded by the Cabinet that the balance of advantage appeared to be against acceding tothe Duke of Norfolk&apos;s proposal at that time.  (C.C. (59) 2nd Meeting, Minute 6.)2. The Prime Minister and I will be visiting Italy in March and will callofficially on the Pope on 24th March. It may therefore be desirable to look at thisquestion again.3. There has been no change in the facts of the situation and I would stillsummarise the arguments as I did in 1957, as follows:  In favour of an Internuncio:  (a) It is a logical measure of reciprocity to the Vatican.(b) It would please Roman Catholics at home.(c) It would please certain Western European and Latin American countries.Against an Internuncio:  (a) There is no pressing demand for it.(b) It might relight the flames of a religious controversy which (for example,in Liverpool) has died down even within my own lifetime.(c) It would offend some Protestants in the United Kingdom.  In Ulster, itmight have a serious political effect for a time.4. To the arguments against the idea I should perhaps add the furtherconsideration that it would set a precedent which might cause some embarrassment to the United States and those Commonwealth countries who, like ourselves, donot receive any diplomatic representative from the Vatican. On the other hand,I have seen it suggested that some of the Commonwealth Governments mightwelcome it if the United Kingdom were to give them a lead in this matter.5. The Vatican have made no approach to Her Majesty&apos;s Government inthis matter. Indeed, I am assured by our Minister to the Holy See that althoughit is certainly the Vatican&apos;s ultimate objective to be diplomatically represented inevery foreign capital, it is most unlikely that they would make a direct request to Her Majesty&apos;s Government to alter the status of the Apostolic Delegate, though they might well encourage Roman Catholics in this country to raise the issue.I have in fact quite recently had a letter from Mr. W. Teeling, writing as theConservative Roman Catholic M.P. with the longest service in the House ofCommons, setting out the case for the appointment of an Internuncio and urging that the time was now propitious for making such a change. Mr. Teeling saidthat he was being asked by many people to raise the question in the House and56566this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government
added that Her Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude was arousing considerable feeling in Rome. This last point is not borne out by a recent statement by our Ministerat the Vatican that he had never heard any complaints in Rome on this score.6. The issue is narrowly balanced and the decision must be influenced very considerably by domestic considerations. But from the point of view of the.Fojeign Office, I feel there are good arguments in favour of agreeing to theappointment of an Internuncio. The present position is an anomaly and open tojustifiable criticism It is illogical that, at a time when we can be virtually certainthat the ideological struggle between East and West will continue at least for some considerable time to come, we should refuse to accept a diplomatic representative one of the staunchest members of the anti-Communist side, while we welcomeAmbassadors and Ministers from a whole series of countries in the Sino-soviet bloc. And although our present relations with the Vatican are excellent, and I donot think that they would suffer if we were to maintain the status quo, a decision onour part to accept an Internuncio would obviously gratify the Vatican and put ourrelations with them on an even firmer and more desirable footing a point whichmay not be without advantage to us in the difficult years to come.7. One reason why it was considered better to take no action when we discussed this matter a year ago, was, I think, because it was felt that it would be unwise to take such a step in what, it was expected, might well be an Election Year.These considerations no longer apply on the contrary it can, I think, be argued that if, as is more than likely, we are to be faced with this issue with increasingfrequency during the next few years, the present time is the best moment to makethe change. There is also another consideration which should be taken intoaccount The Italian Government are most anxious that The Queen should payHer return State Visit to Rome before much longer and it may be that Her Majestywill decide to make it in the course of 1961. If so, this will no doubt give rise to increased pressure on us to accept an Internuncio in circumstances in which itmight be embarrassing to resist.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,22nd February, 1960.
