o9 9&amp; fa(THIS L ..CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(60) 715ch  January, I960COPY NO. -*s VCABINETAIRCRAFT FOR POLANDMemorandum by the Minister of AviationTrade negotiations with Poland were considered by the Cabineton 15th December last.   It was then explained that the Poles would probablybuy from us three Viscount aircraft, provided that the quota for Polishcanned ham was  increased.   However, in view of the difficulties whichthis presented to British agricultural and canning interests, it was decidedinstead to offer the Poles an increase in their butter quota.2.     It has since been found that the Poles would not be interested inan increase in their butter quota-   and the negotiations for a new trade agreement have been suspended.   In addition, the Poles have now notifiedBritish European Airways that they will not be allowed to fly Comets intoWarsaw until the Polish airline had been equipped with modern aircraft.We have learnt that they are beginning discussions in Moscow about thepurehase of Russian aircraft.3.     The value of the order (including spares) would be aboutS.Z\ millions.   But, what is much more significant, it would be our firstbreak-through into the markets of the Soviet bloc and might well lead tofurther sales of British aircraft behind the Iron Curtain.4.     In view of the importance of this matter, I must ask the Cabinetto consider re-opening the negotiations with Poland.D.S.Ministry of Aviation, W. C. 2.15th January, I960
