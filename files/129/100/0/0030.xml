Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1960C. (60) 30 Copy. No.    ^23rd February, I960CABINETPARLIAMENT: TELEVISING PROCEEDINGSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentEver since Mr. Aneurin Bevan&apos;s suggestion in the debate on the Address last november, there has been sporadic pressure for televising the proceedings ofParliament in one form or another. The Home Affairs Committee have consideredthe question and I have myself taken certain soundings on both sides of the House.2. While the idea is, to my mind, not without attraction, I am satisfied thatat least for the time being the objections are overwhelming. I believe that thereis little real demand for it in the House and even less outside; and that its introduction in any form would, on the contrary, arouse considerable antagonism.3. The Home Affairs Committee were, moreover, in no doubt not only thatit would bring the forms of Parliamentary government into discredit rather thanthe reverse but also that it would have an unfortunate effect on the conduct andthe whole character of our debates. Back-bench Members could not be expectedto resist the temptation to address the wider audience, ignoring the House andthe previous course of the debate, and to compete for the opportunity to make their speeches at peak viewing hours. This conclusion is borne out by the actualexperience of Parliaments in other countries.4. Some of these objections might be overcome by the showing of an editedand condensed version of the proceedings, prepared from a film and broadcastat the end of each day&apos;s programmes; but I doubt whether even this would beworkable, since Parliamentary proceedings do not lend themselves to thereproduction of short visual excerpts. A perfectly feasible alternative would be a programme consisting solely of a summary and quotations by a commentator,on the lines of &quot; To-day in Parliament &quot; but this would not, of course, constitute the televising of Parliament in any sense.5. In order to complete the picture, the Postmaster General, after consultationwith the British Broadcasting Corporation, has provided a report on the technicalfacilities which would be required (Annex A). It will be seen that the requirementswithin the House might not be wholly intolerable but would at best be veryinconvenient; and that to provide any kind of &quot; Parliamentary service &quot; additional to the existing television services would (at least in my view) be out of the question.6. But the Home Affairs Committee felt that the objections in principlewere so strong that it would be preferable to base the Governments attitude onthese rather than on the technical difficulties. I therefore propose that the PrimeMinister might be recommended to make, in reply to a Question already put down for next Tuesday, 1st March, a statement on the lines of the draft at Annex B.R. A.

2confiden ti alANNEX AREPORT BY THE POSTMASTER GENERAL ON THE TECHNICALASPECTS OF TELEVISING parliament.T have been invited to report on the technical problems associated withtelevising the proceedings of Parliament.2.   It may be convenient to consider them under three heads:  (i) Facilities required within the House of Commons, irrespective of the typeof programme envisaged.(ii) Frequencies and communication links required if a nation-wide broadcastoutside the present British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) and independent Television Authority (I.T.A.) programmes were to becontemplated,(iii) Cost.Facilities within the House of Commons3. I asked the B.B.C. to report to me in confidence on the facilities thatwould be required. They tell me that proceedings could be covered by means of four cameras situated as follows :  Camera 1   In the corner of the Officials&apos; Box nearest to the Speakers Chair.Camera 2   An exactly similar position in the Members&apos; accommodationbehind the Speakers Chair and under the Press Gallery.Camera 3   At the back centre of the Strangers&apos; Gallery behind the window.Camera 4  A position close to the wall under the Gallery and directly behind the Serjeant-at-Arms.The cameras could be concealed by new woodwork in positions 1, 2 and 4 blendingwith the existing woodwork; for position .3 in the Strangers&apos; Gallery a cabin wouldbe required. The B.B.C. state that neither the cameras nor the operators wouldbe visible to Members. It is right that I should add that the camera operators inpositions 1, 2 and 4 would be working in very cramped positions: even so, their presence would involve a loss of seating which in the official Box in particularcould be unfortunate. In my view difficulty might also arise in the Box whencameramen changed over.4. Although cameras could be operated from the Strangers, Press and SideGalleries, it would be more difficult to conceal them and, furthermore, the steepangle of view might not provide very flattering pictures of Members.5. The Corporation are not satisfied that the present lighting would besufficient to guarantee satisfactory television pictures at night. In the view of theirengineers some ancillary sidelighting would be necessary. In order to decide thisquestion practical tests in the House would be necessary and these could not takeplace before Sunday, 28th February.6. The B.B.C. have suggested that if the Government are likely to come downin favour of the proposals and only in such circumstances would I recommendthis-the Corporation should be allowed to make a practical trial by installingcameras in temporary enclosures and making a complete record of the proceedings for, say, one week on film. They would like to edit this and prepare from it ashortened version suitable for broadcasting daily.Frequencies and Communication Links7. One objective could be to show a very short version of parliamentary proceedings included within the present framework of B.B.C. programmes(presumably after the close of Parliamentary business when viewing is falling off).On the other hand, the objective might be to provide a &quot; Parliamentary &quot; service,
additional to and broadcast at the same time as the existing B.B.C. programmes;this would involve:  Frequencies(i) Using the channels (in Band III) capable of being received on existingsets and which are at present being held in reserve for an additionaltelevision programme or to extend and improve the B.B.C. and IT.A.coverage, or other purposes. So far we have taken the stand that, solong as there are so many unresolved questions in the television field,it would be unwise to enter into any further commitment in Band III(beyond providing near national coverage of the present IT.A. service).It would be difficult to make an exception in favour of the present proposal.(ii) As an alternative it would be possible to share the use of these channelson a time basis with other programmes.(iii) No other channels capable of use with existing receivers are available.Links and Transmitters(iv) One or other of the existing broadcasting organisations would have toinstall new transmitters and build new aerials, &amp;c. The Post Office wouldhave to provide cable or radio links connecting London to the distanttransmitters. All this would take from 3 to 4 years before a nearnational coverage could be given.cost. Capital expenditure of broadly  4 to  5 millions by the broadcastingorganisation and of  1^ to  2 millions by the Post Office would be necessary for a&quot; Parliamentary &quot; programme outside the existing programmes. The annualrunning costs would be around  1 million.9. For a very short version of the proceedings of the Commons within an existing programme the costs would be comparatively small, probably around 250,000 capital and  60,000 annual.10. I have no doubt that, if it were decided that the B.B.C. should enjoyfacilities to televise these proceedings, the I.T.A. would at once demand parity. Itis inconceivable that either the B.B.C. or the I.T.A would accept the production ofthe other, and clearly we could not find accommodation for a second set ofcameras. This would lead to a revival of the controversy about the respectiverights of the two organisations.General Post Office,February, I960.ANNEX draft STATEMENT by THE PRIME minister mr. Donnelly: To ask ithe Prime Minister whether he is now in a positionto make a statement regarding the practicability of televising ithe proceedings ofParliament.Suggested Reply :From a preliminary technical report the Government have received, it seems that the facilities required in the Chamber for the televising of some part of itheproceedings of Parliament would be likely to cause some inconvenience to members and others, although they would seem to be not wholly impracticable. As I have said in the House recently, the question of the televising of its proceedings is primarily for the House itself. But after giving careful thought to the whole question and doing their beat to ascertain the present state of opinion, the Government donot feel it would be right to propose any televising of the proceedings of parliament at this stage.
