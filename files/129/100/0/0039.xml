Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1960C. (60) 39 Copy No.    5 64th March, 1960CABINETPROBLEMS OF THE NATIONALISED industries memorandum by the Paymaster-GeneralThe Home Secretary reported to the Cabinet in July 1959 on the problemsof the nationalised industries (C.C. (59) 42nd Conclusions). He then circulated a report making a number of recommendations for increasing the financial responsibility of the Boards of the nationalised industries, and also for structuralreorganisation of the National Coal Board (N.C.B.) and the British transport commission (B.T.C.). The general view was that the financial and organisationalchanges recommended might provide a valuable basis for future policy towardsthe nationalised industries, but that the Cabinet would need to give furtherconsideration to a number of problems, in particular that of control over pricepolicies, before negotiations could be undertaken with the Boards.2. The Committee on Nationalised Industries have been giving furtherconsideration to these problems. The reorganisation of the B.T.C. is beingconsidered separately as a matter of urgency, and the view of the Committee isthat discussions about the reorganisation of the N.C.B. should be left until afterthere has been a Government statement on the B.T.C. The Committee have therefore concentrated their attention on the financial and economic obligations of the Boards. The Committee take the view that greater financial responsibility on the part of the Boards can best be achieved by getting them to accept a clearinterpretation of their economic and financial obligations. The method we proposeis to set precise financial targets for each of the nationalised industries.3. The first step must be to discuss this idea with the Chairmen of the Boards.Except for the Minister of Transport (who wishes to defer a talk with the B.T.C.while the present talks about reorganisation are going on) the Ministers concerned are prepared to talk now to the Chairmen of their Boards and see how far theGovernments ideas are acceptable and practicable. Given the state of the finances of the nationalised industries generally, there is every advantage in getting ahead with these discussions. Since the matter is complicated and we wish the Chairmento give our ideas serious study, it would be advisable to give them an aide-memoire.This would have the added advantage of making it clear to each Board that theGovernment were making a co-ordinated approach to the nationalised industries and were not picking on any one of them for special treatment. A copy of the note which it is proposed should be handed to the Chairmen is at the Annex tothis paper.4. There is one further point I should mention. At their last discussionof these problems the Cabinet thought that further consideration should be givento price policy. Although the present aide-memoire says nothing about price policy the question will inevitably be raised by the Chairmen in discussions. We cannot expect the nationalised industries to accept financial targets which may be disclosed to Parliament, and at the same time be subject to secret directions by Ministers on prices. If questioned by the Boards on this point, Ministers will say that they are aware of the problem and would like to have the views of all the Boards before coming to a conclusion.5. I recommend that discussions with the nationalised Boards (other thanthe British Transport Commission and the Air Corporations) should now proceed on the basis of the note at the Annex.M.Office of the Paymaster-General, S.W. 1,7th March, 1960.56661b

ANNEXPRELIMINARY THOUGHTS ON THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMICOBLIGATIONS OF NATIONALISED BODIESMore than 10 years have elapsed since the passing of the statutes which broughta number of industries into public ownership. During that period there has been much general discussion on the industries and there have been several enquiriesby the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries and by outside committeessuch as the Herbert and Fleck Committees. There has, however, been so far no general review of the way in which the financial and economic principlesestablished in the nationalising statutes have worked out in practice. TheGovernment believe that the time is ripe for such a review.2. The Government are, therefore, holding consultations with each of the nationalised industries about the statutory obligations as they stand and theirapplicability for the future. The Governments general and preliminary viewson these matters are indicated later in this paper and they would wish to havethe views of the industries themselves before development of further governmentalthought on these matters.3. This review is not intended as a criticism of the nationalised industries,The Government are well aware of the pressure of national and social obligationsupon the finances of the industries and they appreciate the value of the services which the industries and all those who work in them have rendered to thecommunity.4. The performance of the industries is affected by many matters which were dealt with . in the Nationalising Acts their organisation and structure, the irrelations with the Government and Parliament, their relations with the workers and with consumers, and their obligations to the community. These are all of great and continuing importance, but the Government believe that particularconsideration should be given to the industries&apos; economic and financial basis;because unless this is sound and practical, their performance and morale are boundto be impaired.The Existing Framework5. The industries which were subject to the nationalisation measures of theyears 1946-50 differed then, as they still do, considerably from one another in theirhistory and their prospects; their economic strength differed and they had to carryvarying burdens of social, and generally unprofitable, obligations. Their economicand financial rights and obligations, however, as prescribed by the nationalisingstatutes, followed a fairly standard pattern. This was based on the concept thatthey were neither straightforward commercial concerns nor social services, but a combination of both: and on the expectation that the ability to borrow at government rates would enable them to meet the limited financial obligationsprescribed by statute; and also to carry out their national and social obligations.For a variety of reasons (many of which have been outside the control of the undertakings themselves) their financial performance has generally fallen short of the original expectations. This suggests need for clarification of their financialduties, and responsibilities.6. The undertakings were expected in common parlance to &quot; pay their way &quot;.Their statutory obligations are that their revenues should, on an average of good and bad years (or some similar phrase) be not less than sufficient to meet all itemsproperly chargeable to revenue, including depreciation and also the redemption ofcapital and the provision of reserves. The undertakings were thus required tomake some profits in the ordinary sense of that term in order to accumulate reservesfrom them.7. It was envisaged that in some years the nationalised undertakings mighthave a surplus and in other years a deficit. But if deficits are incurred in someyears, surpluses must be accumulated in good years; arid the period over which56661
an average of surpluses and deficits is struck must be definite and not undulyprolonged.8. The wording of the Acts implies that the industries should provide out ofrevenue not only for payment of interest on capital but also both for depreciationand the redemption of capital. If these requirements were stringently interpretedthey would impose upon the industries the responsibility not merely of providingfrom revenue for the maintenance of their capital assets but eventually of riddingthemselves of capital liabilities. In practice, with the agreement of successive governments, the industries,, like their predecessors, have not been expected tomake provision on this scale.9. Their practice has varied according to their economic strength, theirtraditions and the precise nature of their individual statutory obligations. Ingeneral, they calculate the provision for depreciation in their accounts on the historic cost of their assets. Most of the Boards recognise in their reports that,following the practice generally adopted by industrial concerns, it would be prudent to make some additional provision out of revenue to meet the difference, whichemerges when prices rise, between depreciation at historic cost and at replacement cost and as a reserve against obsolescence.10. The Acts also provide for the building up of.general reserves and in most cases give Ministers power to issue directions as to the amounts. Although someof the undertakings show general reserves in their balance sheets these are in somecases entirely obliterated by accumulated deficits on revenue account. In general,the total undistributed income of all these, industries (including supplementarydepreciation provisions, capital redemption funds and reserves) has not been sufficient to provide for the replacement of assets used up in the production process.11. Another aspect of this matter emerges if one looks at the return on publiccapital in the nationalised undertakings and at the return on capital in the private sector, although there are clear limits to the usefulness of any comparison of thiskind because of the very different background of public and private undertakings.The financially most successful of the industries (electricity) has on average earnedless than 5 per cent, on its capital after depreciation at historic cost and mostof the nationalised industries earn significantly less than this on average. Thereturn on the private sector over the. past six years or so has on the other handbeen about 15 per cent. The public undertakings have onerous national and socialobligations: some of them are public utilities with traditions of restricted prices and low returns on capital: and there is continuous pressure of public opinionagainst increases in prices even when costs have gone up. The government believe, however, that the gap between the return on public capital and on private capital is too wide, that it may lead to distortion in the use of national resources,and that it ought therefore to be diminished.12. The financial results of the nationalised industries as a whole (the resultsof recent years are summarised in the Table attached at Appendix) have led to increased drawings by these industries on the savings of the rest of the communityfor their growing requirements for development and other finance.13. The Government think that all these considerations emphasise the needfor a new approach to these problems.A New Financial Framework14. In the Governments view there would be no advantage in altering the basic financial and economic principles which the nationalised undertakings are by their statutes required to observe. If, however, these principles are to providea satisfactory basis for their operation in the public interest they need to be interpreted more precisely in the form of specific financial requirements to beexpected of the nationalised undertakings generally. Some suggestions to thisend are made in the following paragraphs. The Government recognise that these requirements would call for modification to take account of the circumstances of individual industries; some of them are at present in no position to meet them.They would need to be reviewed periodically in the light:of, events both inside and outside the industries. In the Governments view, however, they.would provide ageneral standard against which the performance of the individual undertakingscould be viewed.
15. The Government suggest that the revenue obligations of the nationalised undertakings under their statutes should now be in general interpreted on thefollowing lines:id) Surpluses on Revenue Account should be at least sufficient to cover deficitson Revenue Account over a five-year period: in arriving at the surplusesand deficits for each year there should be charged against revenue the items normally so chargeable (including interest and depreciation).&apos;ib) Provision should also be made from revenue for:(i) An amount to cover any excess depreciation at replacement cost over depreciation at historic cost that has developed in thecourse of the year.(ii) A regular allocation to reserve which would normally be 1 per cent.per annum on net assets, but could be more in special cases,e.g., businesses which are expanding rapidly and requirerelatively large amounts of new capital, or businesses in whichthere are special risks.16. These requirements would be consistent with the statutory obligations.In terms of return on capital employed they would be equivalent to the earningof about 8 per cent., this percentage figure being net after deduction of depreciationon an historic cost basis but before payment of taxes. This required return on capital would be about one-half of the return on industrial and commercial capitalgenerally. A lower general standard of financial performance by the nationalised industries could hardly be regarded as justifying the judgment that they were&quot; paying their way &quot; in any meaningful sense of the term.17. In regard to the capital account the procedures for discussion andauthorisation of matters concerning investment and borrowing might be codifiedas follows:(a) The Government would discuss with the undertaking and approve thegeneral lines of its long-term plans for development and capitalexpenditure.(b) The Government would fix a short-term limit (covering normally a periodof two years ahead) on the investment expenditure of the undertaking.(c) The Government would approve proposed borrowing on the basis of anannual reasoned estimate submitted by the undertaking.id) The Government would require to be kept informed of the extent to whichthe undertaking was proposing to invest new capital in projects whichare from the outset expected to yield a relatively low return.18. These requirements flow from the Government&apos;s responsibility to keeppublic sector investment generally within the nation&apos;s resources, as well as from theGovernment^ role as provider of public capital. The Government would aim atavoiding scrutiny of the detailed investment proposals of the undertaking providedthat they were generally satisfied that there was an effective procedure within theorganisation itself for scrutinising and approving new capital expenditure projects.19. The existing arrangements, under which capital expenditure in excess ofthe approved ceiling, or borrowing in excess of the estimates, are subject to investigation and discussion between the undertakings and the Departments, would continue. It might be possible also to give Parliament each year more detailed information about the estimates of investment and Exchequer borrowing, and to notify Parliament of the reasons for any marked variation between the estimate andthe out-turn.20. The degree of governmental supervision of the affairs of each undertakingwould vary according to the extent of its success or failure to achieve the standardsset out in paragraph 15. Failure, or likely failure, to fulfil the requirement inparagraph 15 id) would be regarded as falling so far short of the undertaking^obligations that it would have to submit to the Minister detailed plans for rightingthe position and in the meantime the Government would take a closer interest in its financial affairs generally. In particular, the undertaking would be required tosubmit to the Government its annual revenue budget for scrutiny and details of allsubstantial investment proposals for approval.   Even if the undertaking were
fulfilling the requirement in paragraph 15 (a), inability to carry out the obligationsset out in paragraph 15 (b) also would, although less serious than failure under paragraph 15 (a), be regarded as inadequate performance and a matter of concern:In this case, the Minister would have to be informed of the general plans of theundertaking for preventing the situation from deteriorating further and for making up the leeway.21. The Government recognise that there are other matters which affect thefinancial performance of the industries and in particular the scale and nature ofnational or social obligations. It is recognised in particular: that significantsubsequent changes in these obligations might vitiate the Boards&apos; estimates of thefinancial obligations which they could reasonably be expected to carry. TheGovernment would welcome any comments or suggestions on this aspect.March 1960.
