SECRET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 10 COPY NO. fcj &apos;S1st February, 19 60CABINETGERMAN REQUEST FOR permission to MANUFACTURE WARSHIPS AND INFLUENCE MINESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 26th January I informed the Cabinet that the Federal GermanGovernment had asked for an amendment to the limitations on armsproduction in the revised Brussels Treaty, to permit them to manufacturewarships up to 6,000 tons displacement and influence mines.   GeneralNorstad, Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, would be prepared tosupport this request on military grounds but has first asked whetherother governments of the Western European Union (W. E, U. ) would agree.V/ ar ships2.    Under the Treaty Germany has undertaken not to build &quot;warshipswith the exception of smaller ships for defence purposes&quot;.    Theseare defined as;(a) Warships of more than 3,000 tons displacement.(b) Submarines of more than 350 tons displacement.(c) All warships which are driven by means other than steam,diesel or petrol engines or by gas turbines or by jet engines.3.   Naval plans of the North Atlantic Alliance call for a german contribution to SACEUR&apos;s naval forces of inter alia twelve destroyers .The Germans wish these destroyers to be armed  with modern surfaceto air missiles.   For this purpose their displacement must be greaterthan the 3,000 tons laid down in the Treaty.4.   The Chiefs of Staff accept this.   Our own guided weapon destroyerswill be of about 5,900 tons displacement.   But the Chiefs of Staff pointout that whereas such missiles are designed to be defensive they couldbe converted to offensive use by the fitting of nuclear warheads andby low angle fire.   Their range might be 65 miles or more.   TheSoviet Union have some of these missiles on 4,000 ton destroyerswith a range of 300 miles.   The Chiefs of Staff consider that we shouldmake it clear that we could not agree to the supply of nuclear warheadsto weapons mounted in these ships.   I would of course like to make this reservation but I doubt its feasibility in view of the fact that we areallowing the Germans to have other nuclear weapons under the key ofthe cupboard procedure with ranges of several hundreds of miles.
SECRET315.   The Germans also wish to construct a repair ship of5,000 - 6,000 tons and two supply ships of 4,000 - 5,000 tons.    Thisis agreed to be a reasonable request.Influence Mines6.   Under the Brussels Treaty the Germsn have also undertaken notto manufacture influence mines.   These are defined as &quot;naval mineswhich can be exploded automatically by influences which emanate solelyfrom external sources&quot;.    The Germans say that they require an advanced type of influence mine to perform their North atlantic alliance missions in the Baltic area.   They maintain that they cannot get them from elsewhere.7.   The Chiefs of Staff admit the German requirement;  but considerthat they should be able to get the mines they need from United states or British sources.   If this should be impossible the Chiefs of Staffsuggest that a co-operative project might be arranged.   They would not wish the Germans to be able to make influence mines of whose mechanismwe had no knowledge.0.   On this basis I propose with the agreement of my colleagues,to follow the course that I outlined orally on 26th January.   That is thatI should seek the agreement of the French and if possible the otherW. E. U. powers to an identical reply to General Norstad that weshould allow the Germans to build their ships up to 6,000 tons butrefuse them permission to make influence minea unless the Germans canshow that there is no alternative way of getting mines suitable for their purpose.   I may have to make minor changes in the exact terms ofthis reply to reach agreement.   I will of course consult the Minister ofDefence in this event.S.
