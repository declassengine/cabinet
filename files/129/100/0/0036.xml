(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (60) 36 COPY NO.   $ I29th February, I960CABINETFEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NYASALANDMemorandum by the Lord President of the Counciland Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations will circulate as soon as I can an account of my talks in salisbury with the Federal and Southern ihodesian Governments but it mayassist the Cabinet if I indicate their views on the main subjects discussed and the problems which arose.(a) The Federal Government1 s views on constitutional advance inNyasalandThe Prime Minister of the Federation, Sir Roy Welensky, and hiscolleagues are quite prepared to see political advance in Nyasaland butthey attach considerable importance to the proviso that the result of anynegotiation   should not place Nyasaland ahead of Northern Rhodesia.   Theywould certainly accept a franchise Qualification of  100 a year income andit is just possible the Colonial Secretary could get acquiescence to a slightly lower figure.   I am doubtful if it would be wise now to press for african Ministers but if Dr. Banda was not in the running it is possiblethey would not be difficult on that.(b) Attitude to the release of Dr. BandaBoth the Federal and Southern Rhodesian Governments genuinelybelieve that to release Dr. Banda in Nyasaland is &quot;criminal folly&quot;.   Theyinsist that his first target is to smash Federation and his second to wreckany chance of partnership between African and European and his third to end British administration and make Nyasaland into a Ghana.   They feelthat we are deliberately putting him in a position to do all these things.Their contention is that directly he is released all the Africans who havebeen loyal, moderate and co-operative will be convinced that violence paysand only violence is rewarded - they will be intimidated and victimised and finally will join the extremists.       They regard this as a disaster in nyasaland but are perhaps even more concerned at the effect on the race relations in Southern Rhodesia which are at present reasonably good.They feel we have made a complete miscalculation of Dr. Banda&apos;scharacter, intentions and capacity for evil and they have a lot of evidence on their side which comes from a security service which I should judgeto be very efficient.   Apart from his speeches before detention, of whichthe extracts attached are typical, they know that the Malawi Party which is organised and waiting for him is recruiting particularly among the nyasaland African police;  they claim to know that orders have been given that the tobacco crop should be burned and government rules regardingsoil conservation and husbandry should be disregarded and that lists-1-SecreT
are being made of loyal and co-operative Africans who are to be dealtwith when Dr. Danda is released.   I cannot say whether the conclusionsthey draw are right because so much fact is clouded by emotion, butthere is certainly a lot of evidence which is corroborated from other sources.   Mr. Holland-Martin, M. P. , had been to Nyasaland and adeputation of African railwaymen had come to him begging for physicalprotection for themselves and their families.   Against this we had quite a lot of evidence to suggest Dr. Banda might be willing at any rate to start talks.   I am clear  that, keeping in mind the wider political objectives, we must release Dr. Danda in Nyasaland but we must beprepared to deal with a very dangerous situation if he proves non-co-operative.   Order could Quickly deteriorate into a state of violencewithout Dr. Banda himself being guilty of an act  which broke the law.We should then be faced with a political decision as to whether anythingshort of prolonged detention or even banishment would restore order and African co-operation with the government.The plan for release on 1st April will allow the Central AfricanAdvisory Commission under the chairmanship of Lord Monckton to hear the loyal and moderate Africans before they are got at and the programmeof the Colonial Secretary&apos;s tour will give time for him to assess these risk and advise us on future action.   In the implementation of this plan the Federal Government will play their full part in controlling thesecurity situation.   They will expect us to make any necessary contribution in the form of police reinforcements from   neighbouring territories.They remain however adamantly opposed to the use of United kingdom troops.(c)       Southern Rhodesia&apos;s attitude on constitutional advanceAt the moment the European population is charged with emotionand there will be a very loud outcx*y on Dr. Danda&apos;s release.   It is quite clear that if the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Sir Edgar Whiteheadwas to go to the country on a platform of secession he would get a large majority.   He does not wish to do this because he believes in federation and in pursuing a liberal policy towards Africans as fast as he dares.   Hisachievements are quite impressive and his proposals for the future goodbut he must work prudently;   otherwise there will be a sharp reaction from the European and advance for the African will be brought to a halt.He is in office on a minority vote . and has a majority of only two so he hasto proceed with great care;.   The Dominion Party are not only in favour of secession but would associate themselves in some form with the Unionof South Africa,   If the Colonial Secretary can achieve political advance in Nyasaland either agreed or imposed, then it will be necessary tomake a compensating move for Southern Rhodesia.   It may indeed benecessary to do this anyhow in the summer or autumn in order to hold the confidence of Europeans at all, following Dr. Banda&apos;s release. i will provide a paper for my colleagues on possible lines of advance whichmight be broadly acceptable.     For instance I believe Sir Edgar Whiteheadwould agree to a Second Chamber with powers to review all Bill s andsafeguard individual rights which would consist of equal numbers of africans and coloured people on the one hand and Europeans on the other.This would not be elected on the predominantly White franchise but bya system of electoral colleges to be devised.   Although he hates it, Ibelieve I could persuade him that the essential clauses in a revised
SECRET-    120constitution dealing with rights and safeguards could not be alteredwithout the consent of the United Kingdom Government.   He comes herein April and we can then judge how best to proceed.(d)       Future Outlook for the FederationIf the Monckton Commission has a peaceful passage and reports in favour of some sort of Federation and if we can prevent theSouthern Rhodesian Europeans from taking some irrevocable stepunder the influence of powerful emotion then we will get throughbut it is a situation fraught with hazard and we have only just scrapedthrough the first of many possible crises in Federal affairs during I960H.Commonwealt Relations Office, S. W.T.29th February^ I960ANNEXExtracts from speech by Dr. Banda &apos;&quot;All countries who have attained independence did not get their freedom through moderation but only through the action of extremists,and it was only the extremists who were rewarded in this fashion. &quot;&quot;I will be the leader of your Congress.   If they send me to prisonin Dlantyre, I am ready for gaol, am ready for everything.   To Hell withFederation!    If they kill me, my ashes will fight for freedom.   If I goto Hell, I will return as a ghost to fight for freedom.   My bones willfight for freedom.&quot;
