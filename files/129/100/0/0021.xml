CONFIDENTIAL      \&amp;c\ .0 ( j(THISDOqUMENTISTm PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEINMENT)C. (60) 21 COPY NO.-9th February, I960CABINETTHE AIRCRAFT industry note by the Minister of aviation on 17th  December, 1959, the Cabinet approved my proposal thatthe aircraft industry should be encouraged to concentrate its resourcesinto five major groups - two making fixed wing air frames and guided weapons, one making helicopters, and two making aero-engines(C. C. (59) 64th Conclusions, Minute 4).   The reorganisation is nowvirtually complete.   Subject, where necessary, to confirmation byshareholders, the five groups are:Air frames and guided weapons(i) Vickers, English Electric, Bristol (excluding helicopters)and Hunting.(ii) Hawker Siddeley (embracing Hawker, Gloster,A. V. Roe and Armstrong Whitworth), De Havilland,Blackburn and Folland (and possibly also HandleyPage and Scottish Aviation).Helicopters(iii) Westland, Saunders Roe,   Fairey Aviation and theHelicopter Unit of Bristols.Ae ro - engine s(iv) Rolls Royce (who are negotiating for the purchaseof Napier aero-engines)(v)     Bristol Siddeley (which will probably absorb   thede Havilland and Blackburn engine companies).2.        In view of the Government shareholding and their location inNorthern Ireland, Short Brothers and Harland present a special problem.I have not, therefore, as yet taken any steps to associate this firm with either of the major groups..3.        I have, with the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,informed the manufacturers concerned of the nature and extent of thefinancial assistance which they may now expect from the Government. Thiswill follow the general lines indicated in my paper C. (59) 185.   The projects which it is proposed in the first place to support include the following:1-
Hawker Siddeley GroupD. H. 121 (Airliner) and Argosy (Civil Transport)Vj ckers GroupV. C. 10 and Super V. C. 10 (Transatlantic Airliners)and V.C.11. (medium range airliner)Westland GroupFairey Rotodyne.4.        It is now necessary for me to inform Parliament about theGovernment&apos;s policy towards the atircraft industry.   I attach a draft statement which I propose to make in reply to a question on the Order Papr on 15th February.5.        I ask the Cabinet to take note of the progress made in there organisation of the aircraft industry and to approve a Parliamentarstatement on the lines of the att ached draft.13,   L3,Ministry of Aviation, W. C. 2.9th February, I960-2-
Draft Parliamentary statement the Government regard it as essential that Britain should maintain a strong and efficient aircraft industry, capable not only of providing the Armed Forces with aircraft and guided weapons, but also of playinga prominent part in the worldwide development of civil aviation. ;2.        On my appointment as Minister of Aviation four months ago,I discussed fhe whole position with the aircraft industry.   I emphasisedto them that, the increasing cost and complexity of modern aeroplanestogether with the intensification of foreign competition now made itnecessary for manufacturers to possess much greater financial andtechnical resources than hitherto.   For this reason, I asked them toconsider creating stronger units by the amalgamation of suitable firms.I explained that the pattern I had in mind would consist of five majorgroups - two making fixed wing airframes and guided weapons, one makinghelicopters, and two making aero engines.3.        I found a ready acceptance of the need for a radical reorganisation;and I wish to express to the industry my appreciation of the prompt mannerin which they have acted.   In fact the initial process of regrouping isnow virtually completed, though naturally much remains to be done bythe new groups to consolidate and rationalise their resources.4. The Government will do all they reasonably can to help theindustry develop markets at home and overseas.   This will be muchfacilitated by the recent reorganisation.5.        In order to provide a sound technological foundation, theGovernment will for the present continue to maintain a substantialprogramme of aeronautical research.6. Except where specialised requirements or public policy make itnecessary to do otherwise, we intend to concentrate Government orders on the five major groups.   At the same time, we shall seek to harmonisethe characteristics   of military and civil types of transport aircraft.7.         In view of the growing importance of the civil market, theGovernment intend to provide increased support where appropriate, forpromising civil aircraft projects and aero-engines.   The nature and extentof the assistance will vary.   The Government may contribute towards thedevelopment, tooling or other initial costs of launching a new type.   Inorder to enable earlier delivery dates to be offered, the Government may also in suitable cases, take a share in the risks involved in producing alimited number of aircraft beyond those for which firm orders have beenreceived.   In addition, the Government may be prepared to contribute towardsthe cost of proving a new type of civil aircraft and of introducing it intoregular service.   Suitable arrangements will, of course, be made for theGovernment to participate in the proceeds from sales.8.        Concentrated in a small number of strong units and adequatelybacked by the Government, the British aircraft industry will now bebetter fitted to meet the needs of modern defence, and will   be-better able tosecure for Britain an important share of the expanding market for civil aircraft throughout the world.Febiuarv, I960-3-
