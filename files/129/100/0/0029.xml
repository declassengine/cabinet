Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1960C. (60) 29 Copy No.    4919th February, 1960CABINETPARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS ON THE NATIONALISED industries memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentWe are under some pressure to agree to an extension of the scope ofParliamentary Questions on the working of the nationalised industries. Hithertoit has been generally accepted that Ministers should answer Questions relating onlyto those matters for which they have statutory responsibilities in relation to theindustries (e.g., accounts, capital investment, borrowing, repayments) or to matters where they have or might have issued directions. After consultation with theMinisters concerned, I am satisfied that we cannot depart substantially from this principle, at least until such time as we may have worked out some re-definition ofthe relation between Ministers and the boards of the industries. But, in order tomeet what I believe to be a genuine sense of frustration among Private members in obtaining information to which they are entitled on the working of the nationalised industries, I think there may be some small scope for broadeningcurrent practice at the discretion of the Ministers concerned. I propose, therefore,to make an early statement on the lines of the draft annexed. If the Cabinet agree,I should consult Mr. Speaker before making the statement.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,19th February, 1960.DRAFT STATEMENTHon. Members have recently enquired about the scope for questions on the nationalised industries.The Government have given this matter most careful consideration, but have come to the conclusion that they must adhere to the view that Ministers can answer questions only on matters for which they have a recognised responsibility.Otherwise they would inevitably find themselves encroaching upon the managerialfunctions entrusted to the Nationalised Boards.Ministers would of course answer for the matters which the industries arerequired by statute to lay before them, and for appointments, finance and matterson which they themselves have statutory powers or duties. In addition they may from time to time be concerned with other questions of broad policy affectingthe industries. There is no hard and fast formula by which these matters couldbe identified and opened to questions in the House, but provided questions relateto Ministers&apos; responsibilities for matters of general policy, they will consider sympathetically the extent to which they can properly reply.February 1960.56562THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
