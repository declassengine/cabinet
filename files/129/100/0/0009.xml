o(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)THE ALDEMARLE REPORT ON THE YOUTH service memorandum by the Minister of education the Educational Policy Committee agreed on 19th January thatthe Government should accept all the main recommendations of theAlbemarle Report, &quot;The Youth Service in England and Wales&quot;, and thaton 3rd February, when the Report will be published, I should make astatement in the House of Commons of the Governmenfs decision.2.   A summary of the recommendations of the Report as they affectthe Government is given in Annex 1..3.   A draft of the statement to be made to Parliament is given in annex 2.   I would particularly draw my colleagues&apos; attention to theproposal in paragraph 12 for a Youth Service Development Council.   this raises difficult problems.   At present about one million young peoplebetween the ages of 15 and 20 use the Youth Service in some form.   TheAlbemarle Report tells us that this figure should be doubled by 1964,particularly having regard to the prospective increase in this age group.To achieve anything of this order .quite novel experiments will haveto be tried out, since the existing types of clubs, etc. , are not attractive to more than a third of the teenagers.   Therefore, I shall need all the help I can get frorn a Development Council, the members of which willhave to be selected for their ability to throw up new ideas and, under myguidance, to stimulate voluntary organisations and local authoritiesto fill in the gaps in the service as it exists today.4.   The relations between such a Council and myself require further thought and I shall be ready to make an oral statement on this point tothe Cabinet.C.(60) copy NO. ^ -is22nd January, I960CABINETD.

ANNEX draft Statement to be made in the House of commons on the Albemarle report with your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, Ishould like to make a statement concerning the Youth Service.2.   In November, 1958 my predecessor appointed a Committee underthe chairmanship of Lady Albemarle to review the contribution whichthe Youth Service of England and Wales can make in assisting young people to play their part in the life of the community, in the light of changing social and industrial conditions and of current trends inother branches of the education service.   The Committee&apos;s report has been published as a Command Paper today, and was availableto hon. Members in the Vote Office this morning.   It makes valuable and timely proposals for dealing with the changing needs of young peopleabout which Parliament has shown that it is greatly concerned.   Onbehalf of the Government I should like to thank Lady Albemarle and her colleagues for the speed and excellence of the work they have done.3.   We accept in principle all the main recommendations forGovernment action.4.   The Youth Service today is an alliance, without adequate resources,between the. Ministry of Education, the. local education authoritiesand the voluntary youth organisations.   We have therefore much todiscuss with our partners before deciding precisely how to act onthe Albemarle recommendations.   The necessary discussions willtake place urgently.5.    We must also co-ordinate the expansion of the Youth Service withaction that may be taken on the Crowther Report and also with theimprovement in other facilities for using leisure which we have inmind.6.    The Youth Service itself requires more voluntary and paid workers,more buildings, more money and more enthusiasm.   The Governmenthas decided that these deficiencies must be made good, though everythingcannot be done at once, and the will to succeed must come from thelocal areas at least as much as from the centre.7,   The following are the important steps that we shall take.8.   The Committee recommended that the present strength of 700full-time youth leaders should be increased to 1,300 by 1966.   TheGovernment will finance most of this expansion by Exchequer grant,and I hope that an emergency training college will be open by 1st January, 1961.9.   The recruitment of leaders will turn on the salaries offered andthe opportunities for transfer to other careers after a period in theService.   I shall ask the interested parties to examine with me how wecan carry out the Committee&apos;s recommendation on this matter.-3-
10. Much of the accommodation used by the Youth Service today isshared with other forms of educational activity;   given proper design and planning this can be an advantage and should be encouraged.   Butthe need for new bmildings is urgent and we propose to work out a five-year programme.   In the next two years &quot;starts&quot; will be authorised for building by the local authorities and voluntary organisations upto  3 millions.   Grants to voluntary projects will be increased.11.  Turning to current finance, grants will be increased for theheadquarters1 expenditure of the voluntary organisations and also forapproved experiments in attracting young people now not using the youth Service.    Some organisations will get larger grants, otherswill receive grants for the first time.12. The Committee recommended that a Youth Service development council should be appointed of some twelve  persons chosen fortheir special qualities and experience.   A Council of this nature willhave to work very closely with the Minister, if only because the jobto be done is urgent and largely experimental.   I need a little more time to consider its composition and functions.13. The Government believe that as these proposals are translated into action enthusiasm for the Service will grow.   We look forward to full co-operation with the local education authorities and believe thatvolunteers and voluntary funds will increase on a scale that will ensure the success of the drive for expansion.-4-
