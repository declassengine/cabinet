[This document is the property of her dritannic majestvs government)C. (60) 27 COPY NO. -JcX16th February, I960 ,CABINET -NY AS ALAND:   PISCU5&amp;IQN3 with SIR ROY WELSNSKYMemorandum by f, heSecretary of State for the colonies the proposals which the Cabinet agreed on 4th January(C. C. (60) 1st Conclusions, Minute 5) for the early release of Dr. Bandahave brought a sharp reaction from the Prime Minister of the Federation,Sir Roy Welensky; and in consecuence it is now proposed, with thePrime Minister&apos;s agreement, that the Commonwealth Secretary should visit Salisbury immediately for further discussions with him. This papersets out our joint proposals for the handling of these discussions.2.       We have assumed that our colleagues will agree that we should adhere to the decision that there must be an early move in regard to constitutional advancement in Nyasaland, ahead of the Federal Review.The purpose of this would be to give Africans in Nyasaland, before theFederal Review, the prospect of political advancement in the territorialsphere and thus help to reconcile them to the idea of Federation.   (It willin my view also be necessary to give some assurances regarding Africanrepresentation at the Review Conference.)   It is essential to such a movethat constitutional discussions should be initiated with Dr. Banda as a free man.3.      The aim with Sir Roy Welensky should therefore be to secure hisacquiescence in a variant of the plan originally put to him, which will maintain this objective.   If Sir Roy Welensky1 s agreement can be obtained,I would hope that my intention to visit Nyasaland could be announced inthe week beginning 22nd February;   and I would then propose to leavethe United Kingdom on 2cth February and to reach Nyasaland on 5th March,after calling in at Salisbury and Lusaka.   Dr. Banda v/ould be released in nyasaland on 10th March for immediate discussions with myself.4.      We think the general line of approach to Sir Roy Welensky shouldbe to try to separate in discussion the two issues of constitutional advance in Nyasaland and the release of Dr. Banda.   It seems that the security risks involved in the early release of Dr. Banda may have been the immediatecause of Sir Roy WelenJsky&apos;s reaction;   but from recent messages it appeaz-that he is at least doubtful about making any constitutional move in nyasaland in advance of the Federal Review and his dislike of this may prove to be a considerable obstacle.   Whether or not there should be suchan advance is as crucial as the release of Dr. Banda.5.      Gn this point, a concession might be made to Sir Roy Welensky-^view to the extent of agreeing that, whilst constitutional talks on Nyasaland1-
should be initiated as soon as possible, no constitutional change wouldin fact be implemented before the Federal Review Conference.Sir Roy Welensky could be assured that in my preliminary talks withdraw. Danda. in Zomba, I should not commit Her Majesty1 s Government toany definite and detailed constitutional changes, although I should haveto give him a broad indication of the kind of constitutional progress thatmight now be made, if there were to be any chance   of securing his co-operation.   My purpose would be to open up sufficient prospect of advance in his mind to keep him out of mischief until further constitutional talkscould be held, possibly in London, in M.ay or June.   Thereafter it shouldbe possible to keep him occupied in the intervening period before theFederal Review Conference, provided that in the initial talks I could also put it to him that, although for purely practical reasons it would notbe possible to bring any agreed constitutional chang.e   into effect in advanceof the Federal Review, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would certainly beprepared to anticipate the results of this change- in making arrangementsfor African representation at the Federal Review Conference.6.      If I am to make any impression at all on Dr. Banda, it is essentialthat I should in this way be able to convey to him some assurance that he himself may expect to participate in the Review Conference as one of the nyasaland representatives.   Sir Roy Welensky may not like this, tothe extent that it might be held to prejudge the whole question of representa-tion at that Conference (on which Her Majesty&apos;s Government have not sofar gone beyond the statement which I myself made to Parliament thatit would be wrong to assume that membership of delegations would be confined to members of the Legislative Councils or the Government benchesBut it is necessary to face the facts so far as Nyasaland representationis concerned and, if possible, to obtain Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s agreementwithout at this stage opening up the whole issue for argument.7.      Although Sir Roy Welensky can be assured that Her Majesty&apos;sSovernment have formed no final ideas on what the next constitutional step in Nyasaland might be, and that as discussions develop during the courseof the year they will naturally consult the Federal Government at theappropriate time, in accordance with the undertaking given in Cmd. 6753,paragraph 33, it will no doubt be necessary for the commonwealth secretary to give him informally some general indication of whatHer Majesty&apos;s Government consider to be the minimum requirements ifthis move is to have any appreciable effect on African opinion.   My own views on the kind of advance that might now be made are set out in the annex.   I am consulting the Governors of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesiaon these suggestions;   and I hope that before the Commonwealth Secretaryleaves I may have their agreement to them as the general frameworkupon which the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s discussions in Salisbury,and my own later with Dr. Banda, may proceed.   As will be seen, I thinkthat there will undoubtedly have to be considerably increased Africanrepresentation in both the Legislative and Executive Councils, althoughHer Majesty1 s Government might not feel it either practicable or desirableat this stage to abandon an official majority in both Councils.   Thus far ourideas might be acceptable to Sir Roy Welensky;   but what is likely to meet with his objections are the franchise arrangements which are contemplated.In the light of decisions in Tanganika, Uganda and Kenya, Dr. Danda willbe able to press for something a good deal wider than Sir Roy Welenksy islikely to contemplate with equa.nirnity.-2-
8.      There is a possible variant of the plan described above, i.e.that my talks with Dr.  Banda should take place with him in detention,and not after release.   My view however is that there would be no prospectof making any impression at all on Dr. Banda in such circumstances;-and that to try to tackle him whilst still in detention would merely be to invite him to use his release as a bargaining factor.   I do not thereforesee any possible concession to Sir Roy Welensky could be made on this point.9.      A third variant would be to postpone my visit and the release of dr. Banda until after the Central African Advisory Commission under thechairmanship of Lord Monckton have left Nyasaland (i. e. the latter partof April).   It appears however that a postponement of this nature wouldnot really go any way to meet Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s opposition to the early release of Dr. Banda;   and the further delay in his release (particularly with the incidental result of refusing him even the option of meeting theMonckton Commission in Nyasaland as a free man) is likely both tomake it more difficult thereafter to secure his co-operation in discussions on constitutional advancle- and to increase the likelihood of securitytrouble during the Mcmckton Commission&apos;s visit.   I would propose in mytalks with Dr. Banda to concentrate on the constitutional issue and not make much play with the question of his co-operation with the monckton commission.   But if my approach had the incidental effect of disposinghim to appear before the Commission, that would be a considerable gain.10.      Finally, I am convinced that no variant involving the release of dr. Banda to the United Kingdom is practical politics.   If he camehere under any kind of restraint (the legal basis of which is in any eventdubious) designed toy prevent his return to the Federation, that wouldneither satisfy the agitation for his release nor substantially reduce therisk of disturbances in Nyasaland.   If he came here without restraint,he could not be kept in play for more than 2-3 weeks at the outside andhe would almost certainly have to return before the Monckton Commissionleft the Federation, if not Nyasaland itself.   To attempt to open up theconstitutional discussions by talks in London would involve calling some kind of formal conference, since other interested parties (includingEuropeans) could not be excluded.   The first approach must clearly be through informal and separate discussions, starting with Dr. Banda;this can be done by a visit by myself to Zomba, but not by invitations toLondon.   Bringing Dr. Banda to London under restraint would offer no prospect of making any political impression upon him.11.     I recommend therefore that we should attempt to secureSir Roy Welenksy&apos;s agreement to the release of Dr. Banda on 10th Marchduring a visit by myself to Nyasaland, and his acceptance of the under-standings regarding the nature of my initial talks with Dr.   Dandaasindicated in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.I.M.Colonial Office, S.W.L16th February, I960--3-SECR.ET
ANNEXCONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN NYASALANDThe present constitutional position in Nyasaland is as follows:-(a) The Royal Instructions provide for a Legislative Council with theGovernor as President, the Speaker as Vice-president, fourteen official members, seven African elected members and six non-African elected members.   The non- African elected members are elected by persons onan electoral roll confined to non-Africans for which the oualificationswere, inter alia, an income of  240 a year and literacy in English.   the african elected members were elected by the African Provincial Councilsbut by additional Instructions of 7th August, 19 59, nomination by theGovernor was substituted for election for all African seats then vacantor subsequently becoming vacant.(b) The Executive Council consists of the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary ex-officio and such other persons as might be appointed by Royal Instruction.   Six such nominated members have been appointed, viz, two officiate, two non-African elected membersof the Legislative Council and (since August, 1959) two African &quot;elected&quot;members of the Legislative Council.   The non-officials do not holdportfolios, but the African members have been &quot;associated&quot; with the workof groups of Departments.2.      The Colonial Secretary in his speech at Leeds on 7th January saidthat he was clear in his own mind that &quot;the time must soon come whenthe question of constitutional advance in Nyasaland must be tackled again&quot;.The Governor has agreed that this must be done in advance of the reviewof the Federal Constitution and can only be done effectively in discussionwith Dr. Banda.3.      This Annex deals with specific amendments to the constitution whichmight be exposed as a &quot;broad general indication of the kind of constitutional progress which might now be made&quot; both in the forthcoming discussions with Sir Roy Welensky and subseouently with Dr.  Banda.4.     (a) Executive Council(i)     The first nuestion for decision is whether we should go so faras to offer a ministerial system, including non-official Ministers.   B.eportsof the progress of the two African members associated with departments are not encouraging, but the choice of these Members of the ExecutiveCouncil, which would have been very restricted at any time, was furtherrestricted because many of the more able Africans were either in detention or so committed politically that they could not be considered.With the release of the majority of the detainees it should become possibleto find a small number of Africans potentially of Ministerial calibre.There would be advantage in continuing the &quot;association&quot; arrangements undewhich the African members of the Executive Council are at presentgaining experience, but it can be argued that persons of the right calibrewill learn to take responsibility with the support of good permanent secretaries.   On balance it seems best to maintain in any new constitution the existing &quot;association&quot; arrangements though, if it helped to seekS EC RET
agreement with Dr. Banda, there might be advantage in conceding alimited number of full &quot;Ministerial&quot; posts or promising to consider theintroduction of such posts after the association arrangements had beengiven a trial.(ii) Whether or not non-officials are given portfolios it would be premature at  this stage to abandon the majority of officials in theExecutive Council over non-officials and there seems no good reasonto increase the size of the Council.   There may be in fact be practicalobjections to this course but, if necessary, it might be possible to concede an Executive Council of three officials ex-officio and threenominated officials together with five unofficials.(iii) On this basis the initial proposal should be that the ExecutiveCouncil should continue to be composed of three officials ex-officio andtwo nominated officials, together with four unofficials.   The governor has warned us that it is not possible to get non-Africans in Nyasalandto accept Ministerial responsibility and whether or not we are publiclycommitted to contemplate a Ministerial system at this stage, we oughtto have this in mind as a longer-term objective.   In addition to this it will of course help with the Africans if we can increase their shareof the &quot;elected&quot; seats in the Executive Council.   We might thereforeoffer to divide these in the ratio of three African to one non-Africanmember.   Alternatively if we went as far as five unofficial members wecould include another non-African.(b)   Legislative Council(i) The Governor must be able to ensure that there is a majority available tocarry on the Government.     This is normally secured by giving the Governorpowers of nomination but in Nyasalana it would be best to do thisby maintaining a majority of officials over unofficials in the LegislativeCotsmcil.   This in practice sets a limit to the size of the LegislativeCouncil since it would be difficult, though not impossible, to find morethan the present fourteen officials for the majority.   The Governor is inany event opposed to any idea of relying on the votes either of non-Africanelected members or of African members for a majority.   Furthermaintenance of an official majority might in the circumstances be more acceptable to the Federal Government because it would retain governmentin the hands of &quot;responsible men&quot;.(ii) If the official majority is to be maintained, there are strong reasons why the balance of unofficials should be shifted as far as possible in favourof the Africans.     Certainly there can be no retreat from the presentposition which gives the Africans a majority of one over the non-Africans.Indeed that advance was intended to be reassuring to African opinion inthis respect.   Moreover if unofficials are not to have a majority ofnumerical balance of representation of particular interests it becomesof less importance so long as minorities have some representation.   Theactual numbers might depend on convenient distribution of constituenciesbut the sort of balance which would be suitable in Nyasaland at presentwould be ten seats held by Africans and three seats held by non-Africans.- J-
(c)   Franchise(i) In order to secure representation on this basis it is not suggestedthat seats be reserved to the communities by name by to devise franchisearrangements which will produce such a pattern.   To secure the non-African representatives this means arranging for three constituencieson a higher electoral qualification, which, it is suggested, should be theFederal qualifications for the General roll - which range from an income of  300 a year with four years&apos; secondary education to  720 a year withsimple literacy.   (In 1957 it was estimated that this would enfranchise in1956 some 2, 500 Europeans, 250 Asians and 85 Africans, and in 1963 some3, 500 Europeans, 750 Asians and 750 Africans.)   Because electors wouldbe unevenly distributed, it might be necessary to make one constituencyof the Northern and Central Provinces, and two out of the Southern Province.Alternatively the whole Protectorate might become a three-seatedconstituency.(ii) The return of African representatives to the extent proposed wouldrequire a lower oualification.   What this should be raises particular difficulties.   The qualifications for the Federal Special roll - basically 150 with simple literacy or  120 with two years&apos; secondary education -were adopted in 1958 for Northern Rhodesia, partly for the advantages which uniformity with the Federal level provided, and partly because,in order to secure the return in each constituency of candidatesresponsible to a multi-racial electorate, it was desired to limit Africaninfluence on the poll.   But in Nyasaland the population ratio - African 275to Asian 12 to European 9 - would make special arrangements of this kind,impracticable.   There is therefore no need to introduce so complicatedan arrangement as in Northern Rhodesia.   In 1958 it was contemplated that the qualification in Nyasaland for the election of African members might be set at  120 annual income with a literacy test.   This, it was estimated, would enfranchise   immediately 1,000 Asians and 12,000Africans, rising by 1963 to 3, 500 Asians and 10,000 Africans.(iii)    In terms of the qualification above this would not be a   substantialdeparture from the Northern Rhodesian level.   On the other hand since1958 lower franchises have been agreed for Tanganyika which set out the pattern for &quot;African states&quot;.     The introduction of universal adult suffragein the Congo will make it difficult to hold even this level, and it isdoubtful whether in Nyasaland conditions there would be any substantialdifference in the type of member returned, if the franchise were set at 120 or at any figure below that.   The arguments therefore so far asNyasaland above is concerned point to offering the Tanganyika modelwhich provides for the following alternative qualifications:-I.   Ability to read and write own language (or is over40 years of age).II.   Office holder in wide range of scheduled posts.III.   Income of  75 per annum.If we cannot do this, we shall be seriously prejudicing our aim of reconciling the Nyasaland Africans to Federation, and to hold out against it would      very soon give rise to the argument that the Nyasaland Africanwas being held back simply because he was in the Federation.   All the
arguments are therefore in favour of paying this price, in the interestsof Federation itself, if that would clinch African co-operation in theGovernment of Nyasaland, even though it may give rise to demands fora similar reduction of qualification in Northern Rhodesia.     In the initial talks with Dr. Banda however no more need be said than thata low franchise   qualification is contemplated.5.      The main difficulty is the possible general repercussions inNorthern Rhodesia and therefore by extension in the Federation.   such changes in Nyasaland may well lead to demands for further constitutional advance   in Northern Rhodesia.    If the implementation of any reformsin Nyasaland is put off until after the Federal Re view, however, it mightbe possible to hold the position for some time further.   Furthermore itcould be argued that Nyasaland would still be under &quot;civilised control&quot;because of the existence of official majorities in the Legislative and executive Councils.   (These of course do not exist in Northern Rhodesia.)On there arguments, it would be hoped that Her Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe able to maintain for as long as possible their publicly stated position that no further constitutional advance can be contemplated in northern rhodesia for the time being, and until the present constitution has beengiven a fair trial.   If the pressure became very strong, it might be contained by an underts-king to take another look at the Constitutionafter the Federal Review Conference:   but we should not go beyond that.February, I960-7-
