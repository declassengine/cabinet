Wehave, however, been unable to reach agreement on the amount of the reduction inthe total value of the agricultural guarantees which we should take as our objectiveat the Review.The Economic Condition of the industry. (a) Output and IncomeNet output in 1959-60 is forecast at 68 per cent, above pre-war comparedwith 61 per cent, in 1958-59 and is well above the previous highest figure of62 per cent, in 1957-58. The actual net income of the industry for 1959-60is forecast at  3564- millions as compared with  315^ millions for 1958-59.This increase of  41 millions is very largely due to the different weather conditions in 1958 and 1959. On the assumption of normal weather in bothyears the relevant assumption for the purpose of the Review it is estimatedthat the net income would have shown a fall from  362 millions in 1958-59to  355^ millions in 1959-60. Table 1 of Annex A shows the movement of net output and net income in recent years.(b) Exchequer SubsidiesThe Exchequer subsidies to agriculture fell from  284 millions in 1957-58to  241 millions in 1958-59 but, mainly because of increasing use of theproduction grants, rose again to an estimated  258 millions in 1959-60. with no change in the present level of the guarantees, the latest estimate for 1960-61is about  260 millions. Particulars of the estimated unit rates of subsidy on individual commodities are given in Table 2 of Annex A.(c) Costs and Efficiency, and the Long-Term AssurancesThere is a net cost increase of  11 millions on Review commodities, mostof which is due to the recent wages and hours awards in England and wales and Northern Ireland. If a similar award were made for Scotland, it would add about  1J millions to the cost increase on Review commodities. Underthe long-term assurances provided by the Agriculture Act, 1957, the maximumreduction which may be made in the total value of the guarantees on this occasion is about  20J millions. Against the net cost increase of  11 millions,we shall argue as in previous years that the gain to the industry from increasing efficiency may be set at  25 millions a year.Production Objectives3. The general objective remains that production should be more economicand that the industry should improve its competitive position so that it may secure a reasonable level of remuneration and at the same time&apos; be able to reduce its

Against the net cost increase of  11 millions,we shall argue as in previous years that the gain to the industry from increasing efficiency may be set at  25 millions a year.Production Objectives3. The general objective remains that production should be more economicand that the industry should improve its competitive position so that it may secure a reasonable level of remuneration and at the same time&apos; be able to reduce its
dependence, on Exchequer support. The Farm Price Review Committee haveagreed that, at the present level of support for some of the more important commodities, there is a danger of increases in production that would be uneconomicin relation to prospective demand. While in some cases the maintenance or evenan increase in the present level of the guarantees may be justified, the commodityconsiderations point, in general, to the need for a reduction in the total value of the guarantees.4. The Agricultural Ministers and I are agreed about this need, but theAgricultural Ministers also consider it necessary to leave the industry with.aminimum part of the gain from increasing efficiency and believe that this can bedone without impairing our commodity objectives. They propose therefore thatthe reduction to be made in the total value of the guarantees should not exceed 11 millions. My view as Chancellor of the Exchequer is that a reduction of this amount will not achieve our commodity objectives and that we cannot afford any risk of further encouragement to uneconomic production. This would be likelyto increase the Exchequer cost of support alarmingly; and indeed for some commodities an increase in output could mean a fall in producers&apos; net returns. Ishould therefore like to see something very close to the maximum reduction ofabout  20+ millions.conclusion. The alternative proposals which we ask our colleagues to consider aretherefore:  (a) That we should aim to reduce the total value of the guarantees bysomewhere about  20^ millions. As this is the maximum reductionpossible under the Act, this must be our opening proposal to the farmers&apos; Unions; in the subsequent negotiations we should aim to keepclose to this figure.(b) That we should aim to secure a reduction of about  11 millions. On this basis we might open negotiations by proposing a reduction of say  14millions, leaving scope for subsequent negotiation down to  11 millions.The changes in the individual commodity guarantees and production grants whichwould be involved in reductions of  20+ millions and  11 millions are set out in annex B.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,5th February, 1960.
