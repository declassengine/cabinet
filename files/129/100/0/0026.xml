Ishould be able to make a statement.Complexity of the Problem, 6. The question involves the rights and interests of manufacturers,distributors and consumers and has wide social and political implications. Resale
price maintenance is strongly supported by some manufacturers, notably the makersof branded textiles, and also by retail chemists, the majority of (but by no meansall) small shopkeepers and by shopworkers, all of whom consider that it protectstheir livelihood. The ending of resale price maintenance enforcement might indeedaccelerate the disappearance of many small retailers and wholesalers. This wouldprobably benefit the economy but it would cause some hardship and resentment.1*,, -Possible Course of Action7. As I am known to be studying the matter, some Government statement isexpected. The possibilities are:  (i) To announce a decision to take no action on the ground that it is too early to judge the effects of the 1956 Act: This would postpone the problem and be consistent with the line we have taken on suggestions for revisionof Part I of the Act providing for the registration and examinationof restrictive agreements. But the excuse for delay is not convincingin the case of the resale price maintenance provisions. How they work is already evident: all that is lacking is the more detailed information,which an enquiry would produce, on the extent and effects of thepractice. The probable effects of removing them would be, even withsuch information, a matter of opinion. We could not hope to justifyany long delay on this ground, and in the meantime would remain underpressure from opponents of resale price maintenance while leaving its,supporters in suspense.(ii) To propose forthwith the repeal of Section 25. This would, in the opinion&apos;of most people, bring resale price maintenance to an end. To do this without giving a full hearing to those who believe that their interestsdepend on it is, I am sure, out of the question. In any case, I amcommitted to consider representations from the Branded Textiles Groupbefore deciding on this course, and I could not refuse to consider the representations which other interested parties on either side might wish&apos;to make.(iii) An Inquiry. I believe, therefore, that our best course is to hold an inquiry.;Whatever our decision it will be strongly opposed in some quarters.It is,, therefore, important that interested parties should feel that they,have had a full and fair hearing. The choice is between:  (a) An Independent CommitteeThe present legislation on retail price maintenance was based onFv outside inquiries (by the Committee on Retail Price Maintenance under- the chairmanship of Sir George Lloyd Jacob which reported in 1949,and the Monopolies Commission) and the public would expect anychange to be similarly based. The findings of an independent body would be likely to command public respect and setting it up would remove the immediate pressure from Ministers. There might be difficulty in choosing a committee that would be recognised as independent, and there would be a risk that its recommendations might,not be acceptable. This could not, I believe, be avoided by limiting theterms of reference to ascertaining the extent and the effects of thepractice. The report would be bound to include some assessment ofthe relative importance and extent to each of the effects, both good andbad, and would inevitably point in one direction or another. The risk that we might wish to decide against the trend of the committeeVfindings could not be eliminated, while a decision which flowed logically \from the report would be easier to defend if it were supported bypositive recommendations. *(b) A Board of Trade InquiryIt would be possible for the Board to carry out a fact finding ;inquiry, by advertising the subject and inviting oral and written evidence as to the present facts. This would avoid the risk of unacceptablerecommendations. But it could not provide a statement of opinion which would be accepted as independent and on which the government decision could be defended.
(c) Public Inquiry by One PersonA single person (preferably a lawyer) could collect evidence aboutthe prevalence of the practice both at home and in other industrial countries, weigh the arguments advanced on both sides and form a viewof the likely consequences of the ending or restriction of resale price maintenance on the economy as a whole, on consumers generally andon particular sections of the public whether traders or consumers. Itcould be left to him to decide whether or not to express his own personaljudgment on the matter. His report would be published. This would avoid the difficulty of finding suitable people to form an independent committee, and would produce a report which would carry more weightwith the public than one by the Board of Trade.conclusion. I do not believe that we can do nothing. This would involve us in publicdefence of the existing situation which, to my mind, is impossible. On the otherhand a decision to abolish individual resale price maintenance without any further enquiry would be unjustifiable and would arouse much resentment. Of the threeforms of enquiry suggested in paragraph 7 (iii) above, I think that an outsideCommittee would be best, but there would clearly be difficulty in choosing onewhich would be recognised as independent. I am therefore inclined to favour a one-man enquiry. This would avoid the problems of picking a Committee, andthe results would, I believe, be accepted as objective without tying the Governmentshands.recommendation . I invite the Cabinet to agree that I should try to secure the services of aneminent lawyer to enquire into the extent and effects of individual resale price maintenance and the practice of recommending resale prices, and to report to me.R. M.Board of Trade, S.W. I,18th February, 1960.
