C. (60) 15 Copy No.     &amp; 45th February, 1960CABINETACCOMMODATION FOR MEMBERS OF parliament memorandum by the Minister of WorksOn 3rd February, the Cabinet asked me to consider the relative merits of atemporary building in Star Chamber Court and the present St. Stephen&apos;s Clubpremises as a means of providing temporary accommodation for Members ofParliament.2.  The advantages of the Star Chamber Court scheme are:  (i) It could be completed quickly (within 12 months of a decision to go ahead).(ii) It would provide the type of accommodation most needed (private offices for two or three members) in a most convenient position.(iii) Its cost would  be  reasonable  ( 46,000 for 6,700 square  feet  of accommodation).3.   Places for some six parked cars would be lost in Star Chamber Court.4. The alternative proposal to use the existing St. Stephen&apos;s Club lacks these advantages, for the following reasons:  (i) There is at present no certainty at all that anything will come of it. Thewhole project is still uncertain agreement on the price has not beenreached (and this is still far off). The approval of the Club membersmust be obtained; the proposal has been made on the initiative of theChairman, and has not yet been put to members.(ii) It would take time to carry out even the minimum amount of adaptationafter agreement had been reached.(iii) The Club building is not well suited to provide the small individual officeswhich are the most pressing need and which the Star Chamber Courtbuilding would give. Although it has about four times the area ofthe proposed Star Chamber Court building, at most only some 35suitable small rooms could be found, mostly on the 3rd and 4thfloors, compared with 30 small rooms in the Star Chamber Courtbuilding. The lower floors are entirely given over to large public roomswith high ceilings, and could not be converted to provide small officeswithout extensive adaptations.(iv) Until I have received a report on the minimum amount of work necessaryto adapt and bring the building up to the standards necessary for use by Members of Parliament, I cannot say whether this would be a bettereconomic proposition than the Star Chamber Court Scheme but Ithink it is unlikely.(v) Although the Club is not far away, it cannot compare in convenience oflocation with a Star Chamber Court building.(vi) If the Club building is taken for use by Members of Parliamentnow, its use will be lost to them while the redevelopment of theBridge Street block is taking place.5. I feel that the Star Chamber Court proposal offers the best, and indeed the only firm hope of meeting the more pressing needs of Members quickly, andI therefore recommend that I should be authorised to proceed with it.J.
