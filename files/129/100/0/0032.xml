SECRET       1 *H *       108(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0.(60) 32Ci19th February. I960 COPY NO.       o *CABINETLAW OP THE SEA;    ICELANDMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and PoodIn accordance with the conclusions of the Cabinet (GO (60)5th Conclusions,Minute 2)l saw the leaders of the fishing industrylast night.    They have made an unexpectedly generous offer.    they propose that for the duration of the Law of the Sea Conferencethey should withdraw their trawlers entirely from the Icelandicfishing grounds and send then: elsewhere.2.      The advantages of this offer are:-(i)    It would avoid any implicit recognition of the 12-mile limit round Iceland by withdrawing only just beyond it.(ii)    It would prevent any possibility of incidents just withinor without the 12 miles, and there would then be no need to maintain Naval protection vessels in the area.(iii)    It would be a handsome and imaginative gesture on thepart of the industry towards the Conference.3.      The disadvantages are: -(i)    It would mean an early announcement so as to enableowners to issue new sailing instructions to their boats.(ii)    There would be greater fishing pressure on other grounds,and this might be resented by Norway and Denmark.(iii)    There would be a shortage of fish and the gap might be filled by foreign trawlers, including Icelandic vessels.There might be refusals to unload. Icelandic fish, giving rise to incidents in our ports.(iv) It might be suggested that by withdrawing entirely, the fishing industry was showing that they could do withoutthe Icelandic grounds, including&quot; the Continental shelf.k&apos;      We need to consider this offer urgently.    In doing so weshall have to keep in mind the position of the good officers and what further part, if any, they can play.    If the offer were to beaccepted, the fishing industry would need to start making arrangements very soon.    There is, too, a real danger of theproposal leaking out.    Because of the time factor I am, with theLord Chancellor&apos;s agreement; circulating this paper direct to theCabinet.J.H,Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food,  S.W.I.19th February, i960.
