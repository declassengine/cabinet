(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER DRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(60) 26COPY NO.16th February, I960CABINETCONSTITUTIONAL ADVANCE IN SOUTHERN RHODESIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations in November, 1959, Sir Edgar Whitehead, Prime Minister ofSouthern Rhodesia, came to London at his own request to put forward proposals for the removal of the restrictions in the 1923 Constitutionof Southern Rhodesia which amounted to complete independence in theTerritorial sphere.   (A note on the elements of subordination in theSouthern Rhodesian Constitution and the measures which sir Edgar Whitehead proposed for their removal is at Annex A tothis paper.)     I told Sir Edgar Whitehead that I could not commitHer Majesty1 s Government to granting any constitutional advance,or even promising it, to Southern Rhodesia in advance of the I960Review of the Constitution of the Federation, but that if he would put forward detailed proposals, these would be considered.        Whenhe left London he expected to forward his detailed proposals inFebruary, I960.2.        This question has been brought to a head by the strongreactions of the Prime Minister of the Federation, Sir Roy Welensky,and Sir Edgar Whitehead to our plans for releasing Dr. Eanda andproceeding to discussions of constitutional advance in Nyasaland.Sir Roy Welenksy has hinted to me that the main opposition comes from Sir Edgar Whitehead, and that agreement might be possibleover our plans for Nyasaland if we could at the same time giveSouthern Rhodesia substantial satisfaction on her claims for&quot;independence&quot; in the Territorial sphere.3.        There is a certain flavour of blackmail about this.   Butwe shall certainly be faced very soon with the problem of removing the restraints on Southern Rhodesia.   If by dealing with it nowinstead of later we can avert a major crisis developing in ourrelations with the Federal and Southern Rhodesian governments as a result of our policy in Nyasaland, the price is not an excessiveone to pay.4.        There are positive reasons for agreeing now to tackle theproblem of the Southern Rhodesian Constitution:-(a)       Our decision that a measure of constitutional advanceshould be conceded to Nyasaland before the I960 Federal constitutionalreview, even if it does not take effect until after the review, make sit difficult to maintain the attitude that we adopted towardsSir Edgar Whitehead&apos;s request in 1959.   It must be borne in mind-1-
that the Southern Rhodesian Constitution goes back to 1923.In any case, it can be argued that,, at the time of the Federalconstitutional review, each Territory should be able tosee the constitutional shape of the other two Territorieswith which it is asked to continue in Federation.(b) Feeling is bad amongst the Europeans in the federation as a result of the concatenation of various recent events.   our high Commissioner in Salisbury reports as follows :-&quot;It is difficult to assess opinion in the Federation sincethe Prime Minister&apos;s visit as process of digestion still continues.But there is no doubt that uncertainty and uneasiness amongEuropeans have been brought up to a head during past week or two.Prime Minister said nothing new to frighten them, but factthat things he said were said by him and in Federation madethem pull their heads out of the sand.   They do not much likewhat they see;   Africans as left as Orton Chirwa paying tributesto some of Prime Minister&apos;s statements, probable release ofBanda, imminence of Monckton Commission, Whitehead1 s talk of secession, Kenya talks and course of events in Belgian Congoand Algiers.   All these developments coming at once have madethe man in the street anxious about his future and there is alot of defeatist talk based on fear that political wind in Britainand elsewhere is blowing in favour of African Nationalism.Prime Minister&apos;s reference in his Cape Town speech to need&quot;to come to terms&quot; with African Nationalism has been seizedon in this context. &quot;In a subsequent letter to me he comments: -&quot;If something can be agreed on the lines of Welensky&apos;proposed compromise, this will give a big boost to Europeanmorale and help us to carry them over the Nyasaland hurdle. &quot;Of course, the substance of these fears derives from a situation of fact which is outside anybody&apos;s control.   But an advance in theSouthern Rhodesian Constitution which appears to give the(so far entirely European) Government freedom to manage theirown affairs might be welcomed as a gesture of our continuedconfidence in the white population and could have a steadyingeffect.5. The elements of subordination in the Southern RhodesianConstitution were designed to prevent discrimination against the indigenous Africans and to safeguard their land (see Annex &apos;A&apos;for details).6. The influence which the United Kingdom Governmentand Parliament can exert as a result of these provisions isin practice limited.   They give us no positive power to insist on improvements in the lot of the African.    They have in factonly been exerted in the background to encourage the southern rhodesian Government to greater liberality.   Their existence-2-S EC RET
has no doubt in some instances discouraged the Southern rhodesian government from putting forward legislation of a retrograde kind.But in the last resort, if we disagreed with a measure which wasadopted by the Southern Rhodesian Parliament and to which theSouthern Rhodesian Government attached importance, the use bythe United Kingdom Government of their powers under theConstitution to disallow it would provoke a major crisis in relations,and in fact this has never happened.7. From a practical point of view, therefore, it wouldprobably make little difference if these restraints were replaced by some kind of &quot;built-in&quot; safeguards in the Constitution.Sir Edgar Whitehead has in mind the idea of a second Chamberwith delaying powers (see Annex A).   This would need careful examination and working out, and, in particular, the composition and method of election of a second Chamber would be important considerations.    But on the face of it this could be an acceptablealternative to the present system of United Kingdom control.   Iwould, however, propose that amendments to those parts of theConstitution which embody the new safeguards should continueto require United Kingdom approval.0. Nevertheless, there will undoubtedly be criticism ofany decision to abandon our restraints over Southern Rhodesia.When the prime Minister met a number of representatives of african opinion in Salisbury in January the latter impressed upon him their opposition to any surrender of the reserved powersto the Southern Rhodesia Government, as at present constituted.It was apparent that, whatever the real value of the safeguardsif it came to a showdown, the politically conscious Africanshave some faith in their efficacy.   Opinion in this country would represent that we were bargaining our responsibilities towardsAfricans in Southern Rhodesia against Sir Edgar Whitehead&apos;s agreement to constitutional advance in Nyasaland.   It would beLoth politic and right that if we agree to Sir Edgar Whitehead1 demand for constitutional advance, we should try to get from him at the same time some positive measure of reform in favour ofthe African.9. An obvious step that we could ask for is an improvementin the franchise to include more Africans.   (The present Assemblyof 30 is all European.   Details of the franchise are in Annex &apos;B&apos;;the franchise is not embodied in the Constitution.   the electorate numbers about 64,000, of whom under 2,000 are Africansthough probably up to 17,000 are eligible.)   Alternatively,we could ask him to agree to some measure of land redistributionin favour of the Africans.   (At the present time about 43 per cent of the land - and generally the poorer land at that - has tosupport the major part of the African population of about two anda half millions, while about 48 per cent is set aside for occupation by Europeans, who number about a quarter of a million.   the african population is already pressing on the available land. )  Itwill not be at all easy to persuade Sir Edgar Whitehead to take action in either of these directions;   they are both matters on whichthe Europeans feel very strongly.-3-SECREf
10. If there are to be constitutional discussions with southern Rhodesia, the question will arise whether we should dealsolely with Sir Edgar Whitehead, whose United Federal Party holds17 out of 30 seats and polled 17,000 votes at the last election.The Dominion Party holds 13 seats and polled 1L,000 votes.    the pattern of procedure, which has been followed when other dependent territories are about to achieve constitutional advance, has beenthat all shades of political opinion and all significant communitieshave been, by means of round-table conference and/or a generalelection, enabled to express their views.    The result of a generalelection on the existing franchise would not be regarded here as an expression of African views.    This points to a constitutional conference with Southern Rhodesia.    But, if we insist on that, weshall be faced with the question whether to settle with the two(European) Parliamentary Parties alone, or to insist on the participation of Africans, or persons who can claim to representtheir views, such as Mr. Garfield Todd&apos;s Central African Party.At present the Africans in Southern Rhodesia are not politicallyorganised.    The Southern Rhodesia African National Congress hasbeen proscribed and its leaders are in detention or exile.    to insist on African participation will lead at once to additionaldifficulty with Sir Edgar Whitehead.    The minimum that we should agree to is a Southern Rhodesian delegation with representatives ofthe three main political Parties, including the Central AfricanParty.11. On a balance of all the considerations, and bearing inmind the importance of breaking the political impasse in Nyasaland,my view is that we should be prepared to concede toSir Edgar Whitehead the substance of the constitutional changes forwhich he asks.    As is proposed in the case of Nyasaland, these changes should be agreed in advance of the Federal ConstitutionalReview but should not be implemented until after it.    Provided thathe (and Sir Roy Welensky) are prepared to withdraw their oppositionto our plans for Nyasaland and Dr. Banda, I would propose to seek agreement with him on the following lines:-(a)  An announcement would be made as follows:-(i)   The United Kingdom Government are prepared toconsider the removal of the existing restraintsvested in the United Kingdom Government overSouthern Rhodesian legislation and administration,provided that adequate alternative safeguards to fulfil the purposes of those restraints can be devised and entrenched in the Southern RhodesianConstitution.(ii)  A Constitutional Conference will be held / inLondon in June, 1960/ to decide whatconstitutional changes would be necessary forthese purposes.    The Southern Rhodesiandelegation to this Conference would be widely representative of opinion in Southern Rhodesia.(iii)   The amendments in the Constitution so agreed wouldtake effect after the conclusion of the FederalConstitutional Review.-4-
(b) The timing of this announcement should be as nearly aspossible simultaneous with.that of the release of Dr. Danda.(c) I would indicate to Sir Edgar Whitehead (though it need notbe said in the published statement) that we should probably have to insist that any changes in the relevant parts of the amendedConstitution should continue to reauire United Kingdom approval.(d) In order to make the proposed changes palatable to parliamentary and public opinion, we must pressSir Edgar Whitehead to agree to some early measure of advance-ment for the Africans, e.g. , an improvement in the southern rhodesian franchise or some re-di stribution of land.    It would be unreasonable to expect him to make any promises in connectionwith the announcement under (a), but I should warn him that weshould probably have difficulty in getting the constitutional changes which may be agreed in June through Parliament unless we canpoint to some positive action of this kind by the southern rhodesian Government.H.Commonwealth Relations Office,S. W.l.16th February, I960.
ANNEX LA&apos;CONSTITUTION OF SOUTHERN RHODESIAUnder the existing constitutional arrangements, Southern Rhodesiaranks as a self-governing colony, but is, nevertheless, subject tothe Parliament and Government of the- United Kingdom in a number of ways of which the following are the most important:-(a) The Governor is appointed on the advice of United kingdom ministers.(b) Generally, the Governor is required to act in accordancewith the advice of his Executive Council, but he is subject to directionsissued by The .^ueen on the advice of the Secretary of State and may,if he deems it necessary, act in opposition to the opinion of theExecutive Council in which case he must report his reasons for so doing to the Secretary of State.(c) The Legislative Assembly may not amend or repeal certainkey provisions   of the Constitution (i. e. the power to make laws, theprovisions regarding reservation of legislation, certain matters connected with Native Administration, especially native land), but may amend the other provisions of the Constitution by a two-thirds majority.(d) The Governor has discretion to reserve or to assent orwithhold assent t) any Bill, but is required to reserve certain categories of Bill (see below) unless he has receive previous instruction to assent or unless the law contains a suspending clause.(e) Where a Bill is reserved, The :,*ueen is advised by theSecretary of State.(f) The Crown has a power of disallowance.(g) Without the prior approval of the Secretary of State, nosubordinate legislation can be made which discriminates againstnatives in a manner not authorised by the parent Act.(h) The principal categories of Bills required to be reservedby the Governor are those which contain provisions:-(i)   discriminating against natives (except in respect of thesupply of arms, ammunition or liquor);(ii) repealing or amending the Land Apportionment Act;(iii) amending the Constitution;(iv) establishing a second Chamber;(v) contrary to treaty obligations.-6-
(i)     In regard to Native Administration, the principal restrictionson the Government of Southern Rhodesia are:-(i) the Secretary of State nominates and appoints the chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Board of Trustees in whom thenative reserves are vested;(ii) the Head of the Native Affairs Department is not removablewithout the approval of the Secretary of State;(iii) the approval of the Secretary of State is required in connectionwith several of the Board&apos;s activities:  the exchange of landbetween the Native Reserves and other areas;   any occupationof Native Reserve land by a non-native;   and the regulations governing the use of the revenues of the Native Reserves.(iv) the provisions governing the compensation due to any dispossessednative are laid down in the Constitution.(j)     Under the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, Southern Rhodesianlegislation is void to the extent that it is repugnant to any UnitedKingdom law applicable to the Colony.(k)     Parliament has full power to legislate for the Colony thoughby convention this is not done without local consent.2.     In a memorandum which he sent to the Commonwealth Secretary,Sir Edgar Whitehead put forward the following proposals in relationto these powers.(a) He proposed that amendment of the Constitution shouldbe within the power of a two-thirds majority of the total number of themembers of both the Legislative Assembly and the LegislativeCouncil (the second Chamber, the establishment of which is permitted under the existing Constitution, but has never been carried out.)(b) The repeal of those sections of the Constitution relatingto the reservation and disallowance of Bills.(c) The repeal of those sections of the Constitution dealingwith native administration and the safeguarding of African land rights.(d) The exclusion of the colony from the operation of theColonial Laws Validity Act and, except in relation to external affairs and the power to make laws having extra territorial effect, placedin the same position as the Dominions.3.      In the course of his discussions with the Commonwealth Se cretarySir Edgar Whitehead suggested that an alternative form of safeguardmight be a second Chamber elected on a different basis from theexisting Assembly with powers to delay legislation during a parliament,although racial representation as such would be a departure from thenormal practice in Southern Rhodesia.   He was prepared to contemplateit in relation to the second until substantial African representation in the lower Chamber, which he regarded as inevitable on the basisof the present franchise, came to pass.   He would be against the-7-
imposition of a special duty on the second Chamber to safeguardAfrican interests but he would be prepared to give them duty of protecting all minorities, including eventually even perhaps EuropeanHe thought he could assume the support of his electorate for an UpperChamber consisting at this stage of perhaps five Africans, one Asian,one Coloured and eight Europeans so elected as to ensure-they would carry out their special charge of protecting minority rights.   BothChambers in his view should be elected and dissolved together andthe parties in the Lower House might each appoint members of thesecond Chamber in order to ensure that the eight  Europeans wouldbe unable to form a solid voting block.    Sir Edgar emphasised that he had not reached finality in his thinking on this question andthat further study was necessary.Another possibility which Sir Edgar was prepared to considerwas that the Constitution should be capable of amendment onlyfollowing a referendum of all those on the electoral roll.February, I960-o-
