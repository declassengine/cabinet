secret this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1960C. (60) 16 Copy No.5th February, 1960CABINETINDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ON MERSEYSIDEMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade as my colleagues know, the Ford Motor Company are planning to establish a large car plant on Merseyside with Government assistance. It will employ8,000 people by 1965, but if the development is successful Messrs. Ford hope thatin 10 to 20 years&apos; time 20,000 people will be employed on the site. The StandardMotor Company have already decided to go to Merseyside, also with assistance,and their plans provide 4,500 jobs. They hope for considerable further growth.2. Messrs. Vauxhall Motors Limited have been pressing me for permission to undertake the whole of their next phase of expansion in Luton and Dunstable,but I have told them that this is impossible and they have now decided that themost suitable development district for them to go to is Merseyside, across the riverfrom Messrs. Ford. They would employ 3,500 people there by 1963, probablyrising to 7,000 by 1966.3. Merseyside is a less unattractive location to Messrs. Ford than scotland or the North-East because it is less remote. They are relying on paying lowerwages than in Dagenham or the Midlands to offset the higher costs of manufacture in Merseyside on account of transport and other factors. However, if their competitors also expand on Merseyside this advantage may soon disappear.4. Merseyside has a population of 1 - 3 millions and a working population of640,000. It is clear that the labour requirements of the car industry will growthough I cannot, of course, make guesses about the relative success of the differentfirms over 15 or 20 years. On the other hand, Merseyside has a young population and a high birthrate; unemployment has run well above the average ever since thewar in spite of something like 40,000 new jobs in that period; and about 3,500 newjobs a year are required over the next 3 to 4 years and thereafter about 2,500 ayear to prevent unemployment increasing. There has also been some emigrationfrom the area to the Midlands, which would stop.5. I have told Messrs. Ford that while no Government could give a bindingassurance about the future, I see no reason why they should not be able to getindustrial development certificates (I.D.Cs.) for their expansion over the next 20years. Messrs. Ford have been promised I.D.Cs. now covering their first five years&apos;programme.6. I do not think that I should protect their future position further bypreventing Messrs. Vauxhall from going to the area. We cannot be certain thatit will not become industrially congested, but there is a great deal of leeway tomake up and the population is rising. In any case, Merseyside is an area of high unemployment and I do not think it would be right to prevent new firms goingthere and so keep people unemployed for some years until Messrs. Ford decide that they need them.7. The alternative course would be to decide that although we still wantmore industry in Merseyside it should not be the motor vehicle industry. IndeedI should be very happy if we could get Messrs. Vauxhall to go to the north-east.56489
But this would mean directing Messrs. Vauxhall to go to&apos; an area where they believe production would be less economic and would commit us deeply to apolicy of planning the &quot; proper distribution &quot; of the motor car industry. This is what the Opposition would like, but I do not believe it is a sensible policy.8. I conclude that I should not give Messrs. Ford any assurance that theywill be protected from competition, but that when these three motor vehicle cases are settled I should at once consider removing Merseyside from the list ofdevelopment districts. Other firms would not be prevented from going there butwe should not give them financial assistance.R. M.Board of Trade, S.W.1,5 th February, 1960.
