Although the n.U.R. alone l^hIf the three railway Unions has so far decided to strike, thelithdrawal of n.U.R. labour could well lead to a more completeIreakdown of services than the 1955 strike of members of theIssociated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (A.S.L.E.F.),lince it would involve specialists such as signalmen who could not &apos;|e replaced by untrained workers, and for whom the Services could l^hlot provide trained replacements.     A strike by n.U.R. would alsole liable to cause a breakdown in the normal Irish and cross-liannel packet services and those from Harwich;    and BritishIransport Commission ports (including the South Wales ports,jouthampton and Hull), would together handle one-third of allInports and exports, might also be seriously dislocated. Thislislocation would extend to the movement and distribution of oil.me possibility that bus crews, particularly in London, would alsoItrike cannot be ignored.

Regions,    Arrangements have been made, as contemplated in paragraphs 6id. 7 of the report by officials circulated to the Ministerialsmmittee on 27th January, 1958,  (E.C.58(1)), to strengthen regionaltaffs in an emergency.     It would be desirable for the officialsw have been appointed Chairmen of the Regional Emergenciesbmmittees to go to their regions for full-time duty in advance ofhe strike, and the timing of this move would be determined by thePficial Committee in the light of developments.      It is not thought[kely that Ministers who have been appointed to represent thekvernment in the regions would be required to take up their posts[ the early stages of a strike. | , The Official Committee onlergencies and its Transport Sub-Committee would meet daily, andle regional committees would meet as necessary, as soon as theled for emergency action became apparent.

WT]                    SECRET IIEmergency Powers ^LWM3. A railway strike would require the proclamation of an ^-utemergency under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, as soon as thestrike began, and draft Regulations have been prepared conferring w\%mon Ministers the powers necessary to meet foreseen contingencies. mmmCopies of these draft Regulations are being prepared and will be ^Lmmavailable at the meeting of the Ministerial Committee on ^L^Lm10th February. ^L^LXThe Regulations would relax certain statutory restrictions on ujMmthe use of motor vehicles (including public service vehicles) in ^Lmmorder to enable the fullest use to be made of alternative means ^L^LMof transport. They v/ould restrict the obligations placed by ^L^Mstatute on the British Transport Commission, the PostmasterGeneral and electricity and gas undertakings.     They v/ould enable ^L^Lmthe Minister of Power to control the distribution and consumption ^L^Lmof electricity, gas, oil and solid fuels, and the Minister of wMmMAgriculture to control the distribution of food and animal m\^-\feeding stuffs.     They would not provide for the rationing either ^L^Lm| of oil or of foodstuffs. The Minister of Transport would have ^^flj power to direct any person carrying on business as a carrier ofgoods by road to carry particular goods from and to such place ^L^-as may be specified in the direction, and to control home tradeshipping.     Where necessary, Ministers would have power torequisition chattels and land, subject to payment of compensation.The Regulations would also contain the usual provisions as tooffences, employment of police forces, powers of arrest, etc.The Regulations would have to be laid before Parliament as^^fl          soon as possible and would not continue in force after the ^L^MWMj,          expiration of seven days after they were laid unless they were mMM^L^L\ continued by a resolution of both Houses.
