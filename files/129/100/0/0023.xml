THE INTERNATIONAL BODY TO KEEP THE PEACEI. IntroductionWhen presenting the United Kingdom disarmament proposals to the plenary meeting of the Fourteenth Session of the General Assembly on 17th September, theForeign Secretary proposed that, in the first stage of the plan he put forward,1 a jointstudy be made of &quot;the nature and functions of the international control organwhich will not only have to control disarmament measures, but also will haveincreasing responsibilities, within the framework of the United Nations, to preserveworld peace as purely national armaments diminish.&quot;2. The present paper is addressed to the problems posed by the wordsunderlined above. These are considered in relation to two different sets of circumstances:  (i) Those of Stage II of the United Kingdom disarmament plan, during whichit would be necessary to begin to develop the capacity of the international control organ to keep the peace, but the disarmament process wouldnot be complete.(ii) Those of complete disarmament.II. Terminology3. Throughout, this paper the following expressions are used as definedbelow:  (a) &quot;Disarmament Control&quot;. The collection and verification of intelligenceon armaments, by whatever means, under the terms of the DisarmamentTreaty or Treaties, and all procedures up to the point at which it ispossible to establish formally that a breach of the relevant international agreements has occurred.(b) &quot; Disarmament Enforcement&quot;. The process by which, once a breach ofthe disarmament agreements has been formally established as in (a)above, compliance with the terms of the agreements is restored.(c) &quot; The Great Powers&quot;. The five permanent members of the security council.(d) &quot; The Major Powers &quot;. A looser term including the Great Powers and allother Powers possessing substantial military and economic potential and able to exercise an important influence on events.(e) &quot; Complete Disarmament &quot;. The state of affairs in which all countries aresupposed to have reduced their armaments in conformity4, with existingTreaties to the level required for the maintenance of internal securityonly.  (See also paragraph 4 (/) below.)III. Assumptions4.   This paper is based on the following assumptions :  (a) The present general pattern of national boundaries and Governments ismaintained, although the possibility of some changes, including the emergence of new economic groupings forming new and greatersovereign entities, is not excluded.(b) Unless otherwise stated, the United Nations continues to exist with itspresent constitution, functions and methods of procedure generallyintact, although possibly with considerably increased membership.(c) A nuclear tests control organisation has been successfully established.(d) The major Powers have decided in principle on a plan for comprehensivedisarmament and are progressively giving effect to their decision bymeans of Treaties or similarly binding international instruments.(e) The major Powers are agreed on the need, within the same framework, for new international machinery to keep the peace.(/) The phrase &quot; armaments . . . and military manpower . . . required for . . .the fulfilment of the obligations of signatory States under the terms ofthe United Nations Charter&quot; mentioned in the Final Stage of the
United Kingdom plan will be dropped as no longer applicable underthe peace-keeping arrangements now envisaged under comprehensivedisarmament.IV.-The Nature of the Peace-keeping Function5. Although the conclusion of international agreements on the level ofarmaments to which all the major Powers are party, and the progressive reductionof armaments and military forces under an effective system of disarmament control,should by themselves do much to establish confidence and reduce tensions, the avoidance of dangerous international situations cannot be achieved by this meansalone. The fundamental causes of international friction will remain, and in certaincircumstances (for example, where fear of military reprisals has been a brake onprovocative action) effective disarmament could exacerbate rather than reduce theireffects.6. States which are called upon progressively to relinquish the means todefend themselves by military force against external threats to their security willrequire to be assured that effective international machinery exists to provide, where appropriate, physical protection for their interests and that any breach of theDisarmament Treaties will be followed by prompt and effective action to restoreproper compliance with their terms.7. It is thus possible to distinguish three functions of the peace-keepingmachinery in its final form:  (a) Disarmament enforcement.(b) Protection of disarmed States from external threats to their security otherthan those arising from breaches of the Disarmament Treaties.(c) Settlement of disputes which may threaten the peace.These are discussed in more detail in paragraphs 8 to 12 below.(a) Disarmament Enforcement8. This would be distinguished from (b) and (c) in paragraph 7 by theexistence of solemn international covenants under which breaches would beestablished and compliance enforced to the greatest extent possible bypre-determined automatic procedures established under the covenants. A breach of the Disarmament Treaties would thus be clearly specified and the enforcementmachinery would be concerned with the application of the prescribed remedies.9.   These remedies could be brought about in either of two ways:  (i) By provision in the Disarmament Treaties for a series of automatic stepsdesigned to bring increasing degrees of pressure to bear on the offendingState, to be interpreted and applied by an independent and purelyexecutive authority.(ii) By reference of cases to an intergovernmental or judicial authority whichwould decide on the measures to be applied.10. It is, however, difficult to imagine either method being entirely self-sufficient. However automatic the Treaty provisions under (i) may be (and it isdifficult to see how, in the field of general disarmament, they can be made asautomatic as in, say, the largely technical sphere of nuclear tests control), theycould scarcely cover all contingencies without possibility of appeal by the offendingState. Some court of appeal, preferably judicial rather than governmental, wouldappear to be essential. On the other hand the authority under (ii) could scarcelycommand confidence unless it were to be bound by some general criteria or otherguidance formally established beforehand by the relevant Treaty. The eventualarrangement therefore seems likely to lie at some point between the two polesformed by (i) and (ii). Since our present aim is to achieve as high a degree aspossible of automatic application of disarmament measures, it is, however, assumed in the remainder of this paper that an arrangement as close as possible to (i) is adopted.(b) Protection of Disarmed States11. The essence of this function would be to provide a service to replace, by international action, the physical protection (against threats arising other than from breaches of the Disarmament Treaties) of disarmed States, and of their
nationals, commercial ships and aircraft outside their frontiers, which in an armedworld would be afforded by national forces or by those of other States under some formal or informal international arrangement. In the great majority of casesthis service would be provided at the specific request of the threatened State;but it is possible to imagine circumstances in which it would need to be providedwithout prior request, and some protective functions might best be exercisedcontinuously, e.g., by patrol or other activity.12. The giving of protection will require decisions on a wide variety ofdifferent situations. In principle the choice between &quot; automaticity &quot; and political control discussed in paragraph 9 above also applies to control of this function.The problem of devising sufficiently exhaustive automatic criteria for interpretationby an executive body, seems, however, to be formidable.(c) Settlement of Serious Disputes13. The nature of this function will not change materially in a disarmedworld; but, if the regime of the Disarmament Treaties is not to be seriously strained,it will be important to ensure that no dispute is allowed to reach a stage at whichthe States concerned may be driven to forcible remedies. If this is to be ensuredin all circumstances, more effective international machinery than now exists mustbe established by which a graduated range of techniques, from good offices, throughconciliation and compulsory arbitration to coercion including, in the last resort,coercion by armed force, can be applied as needed.V. Machinery required for the Peace-keeping Functions14. The three functions each seem likely to require the following international machinery:  (a) Disarmament Enforcement(i) An executive body to interpret the Treaty and apply enforcementmeasures.(ii) A World Court of Appeal.(iii) An International Security Force at the disposal of the executivebody.(b) Protection of Disarmed States(i) An executive or political body to receive requests from threatenedStates and to decide, on request or otherwise, whether and howprotection is to be afforded.(ii) Negotiation, conciliation, arbitral and judicial machinery for removing external threats by peaceful means where appropriate(see (c) below).(iii) An International Security Force to give physical protection fromexternal threats.(c) Settlement of Serious DisputesIt can be assumed that, as at present, the great majority of differences between States will be settled by normal bilateral means. On the breakdown of bilateral negotiations, or on reasonable request of the parties, the followinggraduated series of services seem likely to be required:  (i) Good offices.(ii) Conciliation machinery (advisory).(iii) Voluntary arbitration arrangements.(iv) Compulsory arbitration (for matters lying outside then existing international Law).(v) Judicial machinery a World Court (for matters covered by then existing International Law).Coercive machinery to be applied at the instance of the World Court orother appropriate authority when (i) to (v) above have been exhausted wouldbe necessary to any complete peace-keeping system.(vi) Machinery for application of peaceful sanctions and other measuresshort of armed force.(vii) An International Security Force for application of armed force.
VL-Organisation of the Peace-keeping Machinery15. For reasons of efficiency and economy it would clearly be important asfar as possible to combine the various organs required under the three headings inPart V. (There may, hov/ever, be political and practical difficulties in the wayof combining &quot; automatic &quot; functions such as those governed by the DisarmamentTreaties and others which, although similar, may still depend on normal bilateralor multilateral machinery.)   The following are the main possibilities:  (a) The executive bodies required by the &quot;automatic&quot; provisions of thedisarmament enforcement and protection machinery (Part V) could be combined into a single entity.(b) The World Court required by all three functions could be a single entitywith multiple jurisdiction.(c) The International Security Force would be a single entity responding to various authorities in accordance with a clearly defined system of priorities as follows:  (i) Disarmament enforcement.(ii) Protection of disarmed States.(iii) Enforcement of decisions of the World Court in intractable disputes arising in other ways.(iv) International disaster relief and rescue work.(It would also seem logical to combine to some extent the InternationalSecurity Force and the disarmament control organs, e.g., by drawing the staffs of inspection teams from the Force, using common air services, &amp;c.)(d) The conciliation and arbitration machinery required under Part V (b) and(c) would clearly be a single system.VIL- The Question of Supervision and General ConsultationSupervision16. But however successfully the main peace-keeping functions are performedindividually it is extremely difficult to conceive of any effective world system which does not provide for formal co-ordination and supervision of the whole range of activities which keeping the peace involves. The Disarmament treaties with proper arrangements for enforcement will represent a substantial jump towards a regime of world law, but at any foreseeable time there are likely to be greatlacunae - in the body of formal agreements which must be filled by normalintergovernmental decisions on the present pattern. And even if, eventually, a fairly comprehensive system of peace-keeping law could be set up, this law, like anyother, would have to evolve with changing conditions, requiring a deliberative,legislative body of some kind.17. In the foreseeable future the practical choice of arrangements forco-ordination and supervision seems to lie between:  (a) The Security Council.(b) Some other international grouping, including the Great Powers, selected from those States which have accepted the provisions of a DisarmamentTreaty or Treaties.Three of the Great Powers at present have a general mandate from the united nations for reaching agreement on nuclear tests control, and, together with a fourth and six other States, responsibility for negotiating the first steps which may leadto more comprehensive disarmament measures under safeguards. In Stage II ofthe United Kingdom plan, when the organisation for keeping the peace cannotbe fully developed and the process of disarmament is still concerned mainly withthe major Powers and is entirely dependent on their will to continue with it, some limited grouping of this kind would probably continue to be effective.Consultation18. It seems doubtful, however, once the matters to be dealt with under adeveloping disarmament system begin to require compliance and co-operation ofall States in a wide field, whether such a limited grouping of by now largelydisarmed States can expect the remainder of those concerned to accept without
demur its decisions, either for further steps towards complete disarmament orarising out of the need for supervision of existing peace-keeping procedures, unless some form of deliberative machinery, in which all States have a chance to express their views on each step at a formative stage, is set up. Such deliberative machinerycould be created, on the basis of paragraph 17 (b) above, by electing a number of states parties to the Disarmament Treaty or Treaties to serve on it, for a period orpermanently.19. Use of the Security Council, or of some other limited body including theGreat Powers and answerable in some degree to the Security Council, which in itsturn would automatically report to the General Assembly, might go some way tosolving these difficulties. Whether this solution is adopted must, however, depend largely on measures adopted in the intervening stages of the disarmament controlnegotiations to secure the general approval of world opinion for what is done.These are discussed in Part VIII below. It must be borne in mind that effective use of the Security Council in this field would involve amendments to the united nations Charter which might be difficult to secure.VIIL-The Intermediate Stages20. Parts IV to VII of this paper have dealt largely with the logicalrequirements of a complete peace-keeping system. But the form of arrangementfinally adopted will clearly be influenced to a considerable extent by the earlyevolution of disarmament, whether along the lines of the United Kingdom planor otherwise.21. The present section examines the requirements of Stage I and Stage II ofthe United Kingdom plan, and traces a possible line of evolution to the final stage of complete disarmament.22. Stage I of the United Kingdom plan provides for the establishment of aninternational disarmament organisation concerned purely with disarmamentcontrol matters, i.e., in that stage, the collection of intelligence on arms includingmissiles and satellites and the supervision of storage depots for surplus armaments.In later stages its control functions would expand as other measures were put intoeffect. The organisation would thus at the outset require to establish a body of executive personnel for continuous operations both at headquarters and in the field.23. Stage II provides for further development of the Organisation includingadaptation and expansion of the control machinery to digest an increased intake of information on, e.g., the manufacture of conventional arms and fissile materials;and to carry out such functions in the field as on-the-spot control of missilelaunchings, the supervision of the transfer of fissile materials to peaceful uses,and inspection in connexion with any agreement on surprise attack measures.24. Thus by the time the first stages of the establishment of the international body to keep the peace can be undertaken an expanding executive body possessinga considerable field organisation will be in active existence.25. At this stage continued progress towards any workable international system must still depend basically on the united will and support of the major powers. They will effectively take the place of the enforcement &quot; executive body &quot;mentioned in Part V until the latter begins to function (see paragraph 27 below).26. Since the major Powers will also continue to control the only considerablemilitary resources, it would appear logical that they should provide an interimsolution to the problem of founding an International Security Force either bysubmitting military forces to international control on a stand-by basis, or by placing them under the direct day-to-day control of an international executive body on the lines foreseen in Part V. But it would seem essential to build up theinternational element proper in the form of a standing force so that its strengthand efficiency develop progressively pan passu with the reduction in armamentsforeseen in Stage II and the Final Stage. By the end of the latter stage theInternational Force must command sufficient strength to be more than a matchfor any existing military force or possible combination of existing forces. To ensurethis it would be essential to equip it with nuclear weapons, as well as the capacity to counter effectively the use of any form of military technique including rocketsand satellites. In the early stages this equipment can be obtained from the products of the disarmament process: but in the long run equipment to a newly establishedinternational standard would constitute an additional safeguard against abuse.
27. The establishment of the &quot; executive body &quot;,. which will progressivelyassume responsibility for administering the &quot; automatic&quot; Disarmament treaty provisions seems likely to constitute the most difficult single problem of Stage II.An &quot;automatic&quot; solution would call for rigid exclusion from its deliberationsand actions of any element outside the letter of the Disarmament and other Treatiesconcerned, and the highest degree of universal confidence in its capacities andjudgments. Personnel of the highest calibre would therefore be essential. It isdifficult to imagine the successful launching of an autonomous body of this kindexercising virtually paramount authority in anything resembling the presentclimate of international politics; but by the end of Stage II the need for it willbe urgent if the danger of day-to-day political interference in the implementation of the &quot; automatic &quot; provisions of the Treaties is to be eliminated.28. The World Court, and reinforced conciliation and arbitral machinery,can perhaps be approached at more leisure, particularly if, with increased great power harmony, the existing wide powers of the Security Council can be made more effective. In the longer term some solution involving a special conciliation and arbitral arm of the World Court machinery might well recommend itself.29. General acceptance without reservations of the jurisdiction of theInternational Court of Justice would go a long way towards providing the Courtof Appeal required by the&apos; automatic provisions of the Disarmament Treaties(Part V). Success in using the Court for this purpose could lead to steps for the extensive strengthening of the Court and its machinery which would be requiredin order to enable it to shoulder the burdens of a World Court. On the otherhand a new body could be devised.IX. Relations with the United Nations30. Throughout the early stages of disarmament the United Nations willcontinue to bear its existing responsibility for maintaining world order. The united nations Disarmament Commission, comprising all members of the United Nations,will probably also continue to exist. It will be important to avoid any action which appears to undermine United Nations prerogatives because this may reduce the willingness of the broad mass of member States to co-operate in measures for the detailed implementation of disarmament and peace-keeping arrangements in the later stages.31. There seems to be no reason why the present arrangement, whereby the10-Power Disarmament Committee will report at intervals to the United NationsDisarmament Commission, should not continue to apply throughout the early stages of the disarmament process. But when the peace-keeping body, togetherwith the International Security Force, come to be formed some means of relatingthem to the United Nations will have to be devised. One solution would be to givethe peace-keeping body autonomous status within the United Nations framework.It would report, but not be directly responsible, to the Security Council.32. A solution of this kind would leave the conciliation and other advisoryfunctions of the Security Council intact, while assigning the hitherto ineffectivepeace-keeping functions to another body. The Great Powers would form a link between the two. The General Assembly could if necessary provide the purelydeliberative body mentioned in paragraph 18.X. Conclusions33.-(a) Disarmament control machinery must be supported by arrangementsfor disarmament enforcement and protection of the disarmed States, as well as byreinforced world conciliation, arbitration and judicial machinery, if the peace isto be effectively kept.(b) Under the provisions of the Disarmament and related Treaties an executivepeace-keeping body of high calibre, an International Security Force answerable to it and a World Court of Appeal should be in existence by the beginning of theFinal Stage of the United Kingdom Disarmament Plan.(c) The executive peace-keeping body should be an autonomous entityreporting to the Security Council, but not directly responsible to it and assuming the executive peace-keeping functions of the Council in so far as these are coveredby the provisions of the Treaties.
id) The Security Council should retain its present advisory functions. Itcould play a useful part in initiating general action required for the settlement ofintractable disputes not involving matters covered by the Treaties.ie) Reinforced conciliation and arbitration machinery should be set up either by extension of the present powers of the Security Council or by forming a newelement attached to the World Court.(/) The nucleus of a World Court should be set up, if possible during Stage II,either by forming a new entity or by reinforcing the International Court of justice to shoulder these functions. As a preliminary step it would be important to ensurethat all States agree in principle to accept the jurisdiction of the Court, withoutreservations which would hinder the process of enforcing the Disarmament treaties and of keeping the peace.February, I960.
