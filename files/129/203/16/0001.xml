CP(78)91 copy no 8018 September 1978CABINETRHODESIAN SANCTIONS:  FURTHER INQUIRYMemorandum by the Prime minister- At Cabinet on 7 September we had a preliminary discussion about theneed for a further inquiry following the Bingham Report.    Since then I havegiven the matter further thought and this note sets out my conclusions.2. There will undoubtedly be Parliamentary pressure for some furtherinquiry in the light of the Bingham Report disclosures.    I do not howeverthink that my colleagues ought to underrate the problems to which it will giverise.    Unlike Bingham a new inquiry will inevitably be directed primarily to considering the actions of Ministers and civil servants in relation to oilsanctions.    As such it carries considerable political risks, even though there can be no doubt that our attitude towards sanctions was always a morerobust one than that of the Conservative Government.    The circumstancestoday are different from those of the 1960s and an inquiry will necessarily involved judgment by hindsight on the sort of questions which are now being asked - eg were successive Governments sufficiently assiduous in satisfyingthemselves that the spirit and the letter of the sanctions law were beingobserved?    Was there a dichotomy between what Governments thought andknew and what they said?    Were some or all Ministers misled and if so by whom?    And were Governments sufficiently open with Parliament?Furthermore such questions could not be satisfactorily resolved without theProduction of Cabinet documents (and probably a much wider range than was seen by Bingham) with all the wider risks that this precedent would entail in both the domestic and international contexts.    Moreover colleagues willrecall that overseas Governments (including Zambia) and also foreign oil companies refused to co-operate with the Bingham inquiry.    They would nodoubt do so again.    So the more we wash our soiled linen in public, the morewe shall be placing the United Kingdom in a dock which should properly be occupied by others who were not, like us, trying genuinely to make sanctionswork.    Finally it also goes without saying that a further inquiry wouldprobably prevent prosecutions for breaches of the Sanctions Orders. Thiswould certainly be so in the case of a wide-ranging inquiry sitting in public:and even in the case of an inquiry with narrower terms of reference and sittingxn private it would probably be necessary to grant immunity to witnesses.
3. Nevertheless the Cabinet may decide that an inquiry is inescapable.If so, my conclusions on the terms of reference and nature of such an inquiry, together with my reasons for arriving at them, are set out in thefollowing paragraphs.TERMS OF REFERENCE4. Bingham has already examined in depth the actions of british petroleum (BP) and Shell up to the present and, subject to the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary1 s advice on the latest allegations by the Sunday times, it seems that the field of inquiry which remains relates mainly tothe actions of Ministers and civil servants from 1966 to now.    I thinktherefore that the terms of reference of a further inquiry might bet-following the Report of the Bingham inquiry, to consider the part played by those concerned during successive Administrations inrelation to the development and application of the policy of oilsanctions against Rhodesia, and to report&quot;.FORM OF AN INQUIRY5. In the light of paragraph 2 above, it seems to me that any new inquirymust be sufficiently authoritative to carry conviction and that some at least of its members should approach the matter with political understanding and experience.    It ought also to be capable of completing its task within areasonable period.    At the same time while it will be necessary to produceCabinet documents to the inquiry it would be most undesirable on general grounds for these to be published.    The same will apply to confidentialcommunications with other Governments.6. With these considerations in mind my view is that the best form of inquiry would be a Royal Commission sitting full-time and comprised ofPrivy Counsellors.    I have it in mind that it might be headed by Lord Scarmanwho would sit with two Labour and two Conservative Privy Counsellors: andthat Mr Bingham would be available to assist the inquiry as necessary. Asmall body of this kind should be able to carry out its investigation quickly and thoroughly.    It v/ould combine the right elements of impartiality andpolitical understanding.    Making it a Royal Commission would underlinethe seriousness with which we viewed the matter.    A Royal commission would have the advantage that the Royal Warrant would give power to call for^formation, documents and witnesses: it would not give the power of enforcing this but witnesses would hardly refuse.    The fact that theCommission^ members would be Privy Counsellors would make it easier to produce Cabinet papers.    It might be sensible to leave it to the inquiry to decide whether any of its hearings should be in public having regard tol* the desirability of avoiding the prejudice of prosecutions if possible and11 * the need to preserve confidentiality of Cabinet documents.    I will tell mycolleagues orally whom I have in mind as the Labour members of such an inquiry.2
7. In arriving at this conclusion I have of course considered other types of inquiry.    My colleagues may find it helpful to know the objections to them:a. A Tribunal of Inquiry under the 1921 ActThere is a widespread belief, which I know some colleagues share,that Tribunals under the 1921 Act are unsatisfactory in a number ofrespects.    For present purposes, however, the main objection isthat it would proceed under an inquisitorial procedure with manywitnesses being legally represented.    It would not therefore be an appropriate body to make a subjective, and &quot;political&quot; in the non-Party sense, judgment on the efficiency and integrity of the internalGovernment machine.    It would sit in public and it would take a very long time.    It would therefore be the course most likely to involve usin continuing embarrassment with other countries.b. A Select CommitteeThe Salmon Royal Commission on Tribunals of Inquiry convincinglyruled out Select Committees as a method of investigating allegations of public misconduct (for which in any case they had not been usedsince the Marconi case in 1921).    The overriding objection is thatalmost certainly any such Select Committee would be likely very quickly to divide on Party lines and thus defeat the purpose of adispassionate objective inquiry.    And producing Cabinet papers to a select Committee would establish a very significant and dangerous precedent, eg would it be possible thereafter to refuse the expenditure committee permission to see the relevant Cabinet papers underlyinga policy decision?c. A further inquiry by Mr BinfthamIn the cover note to his Report Bingham emphasises that his terms ofreference were confined to finding out how oil had reached rhodesia and whether the Sanctions Orders were breached;  and that he did not therefore investigate or pass judgment on &quot;contemporaneous political,diplomatic aid economic events&quot; although any judgment on what hediscovered &quot;requires close attention to the context in which itoccurred&quot;.    It could be argued that since Bingham has alreadymastered much of the relevant material he should conduct the furtherinquiry.    I do not however believe that he would be regarded as a sufficiently weighty public figure to pass what would be a subjectiveand non-legal judgment on the functioning of Government, and thatthe right course is to make him in effect an assessor to the newinquiry.3
8. I conclude therefore that, if we are to have a further inquiry, ourpurposes would be best served by a body on the lines set out in paragraph above and with terms of reference as set out in paragraph 4 above.LJC10 Downing Street18 September 19784
