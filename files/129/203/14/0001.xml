CP(78) 89 COPY no. 5 September 1978CABINETRHODESIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for foreign and Commonwealth affairs. I kave been working in the close at contact with .Mr   Cyrus Vance, the United States Secretary of State, President Kaunda ofZambia and the former Nigerian Foreign Minister, Mr   Joe Garba, to helparrange, at Mr. Joshua Nkomo&apos;s request, secret direct talks between him and Mr Ian Smith which we knew Mr Smith also wanted.    As is now known,these talks took place on 14 August.    A second stage secret meeting between mr Mugabe, Mr Nkomo and Mr Smith was planned to take place soon after.Mr Mugabe, however, had second thoughts and, despite Nigerian pressure,eventually managed to persuade Presidents Nyerere (Tanzania) and Machel(Mozambique) to support him in his opposition to such a meeting.Presidents Kaunda, Khama (Botswana) and Neto (Angola) are in favour of asecond meeting, as are the Nigerians.2. The Front-Line Presidents1 meeting in Lusaka ended without agreement and the same grouping are due to meet this coming Saturday.    There areadvantages in Mr Nkomo and Mr Mugabe attending a second meeting withMr Smith hut without some sign that Mr Smith accepts for the Transition a united Nations (UN) presence, a Resident Commissioner and integration ofthe forces there is little chance of Mr Mugabe attending, or PresidentsNyerere and Machel agreeing.    Mr Smith and Chief Chirau are prepared toaccept Mr Nkomo as Chairman of the Transitional Council with Mr Mugabeserving under Mr Kkomo.    Mr Si thole may be persuaded to go along withthis but Bishop Muz^rewa, who has the most to lose, will prove hard to shift.3. Mr Smith has always wanted to split the Patriotic Front. Reluctantlyhe may now accept that Mr Mugabe has to come in with Mr Nkomo but thereis no sign that he is yet prepared to accept Mr Nkomo1 a negotiating position,which is a Council with 4 for the Patriotic Front and 4 for the ExecutiveCouncil with the Chairman, Mr Nkomo, being the ninth member, decisions to be taken by majority vote.    Nor do we know if he is prepared to acceptthe concept of a Transitional Constitution with a British resident commissioner having complete power over law and order, and a UN presencefor a period of approximately three months leading up to a referendum to endorse the Transitional Constitution, an outline Independence constitution and a date for an election (probably 9 months away).    If the people of1
Rhodesia as a whole endorsed such an arrangement, a second Order-in-Council would be made under an enabling Act (which the British parliament would already have passed).    Independence would follow automatically andthe British Resident Commissioner would be withdrawn.    Bishop Muzorewawill not like this arrangement because it postpones early elections in whichhe would hope to do well, and giving Mr Nkomo the chairmanship of theCouncil makes it more likely that Mr Nkomo would emerge in any electionas the President,    The main political problem for Britain is that by givingindependence before elections there could be no absolute guarantee thatelections would take place.4. The option Bishop Muzorewa would probably prefer is for the resident Commissioner and the UN to stay until an election could be held,as was originally proposed in the Anglo-American Plan (AAP).    Apart fromthe difficulty of negotiating this, the danger is that since the nationalistleaders want a Council which has executive and legislative powers duringthe Transition, and are only prepared to leave the Resident Commissionerwith control over law and order, Britiah could find itself theoreticallysupervising an election but powerless to prevent the Council from taking decisions which might affect the fairness of the election,5. Annex A contains an explanation of the Transitional Constitution,Annex B the first Order-in-Council that would be necessary for theimmediate restoration of legality   and Annex C the draft Security council resolution to appoint a Special Representative and to establish a UNpeacekeeping presence.6. A new development is that the Rhodesian National Joint OperationsCommand (NJOC), which includes all the military commanders, are seriously contemplating a coup followed by a renunciation of the unilateral declaration of Independence (UDI).    They are becoming totally dis-enchanted   with the internal settlement, with the black nationalist leaders and with Mr Smith.    If there is no chance of persuading Mr Nkomo tocome into the government, there is a possibility that they might act. Theyhave already sounded us out privately on our attitude.    We have told themfirmly that their first responsibility is to pressurise Mr Smith to negotiateso as to come to a serious agreement with Mr Nkomo and Mr Mugabe, Wehave told them they are wrong to make the assumption that the mere transferof power to Britain following a renunciation of UDI insulates us in Britainfrom the need to come to an accommodation with the Patriotic Front, Wehave therefore discouraged them now from taking this course, which hasthe gravest dangers, pointing out to them that an accommodation withMr Nkomo and Mr Mugabe which has Mr Smith&apos;s imprimatur will help theconfidence of the whites and that the Patriotic Front are more likely to compromise in negotiating a settlement than if they feel cheated by beingpresented by a fait accompli and, as they will see it, a colonialist Britain.We cannot, however, rule out that the NJOC might take this action without consultation during or in the immediate aftermath of an election.    If theydid invite Britain in, some in Britain would argue that we should immediatelydespatch the Resident Commissioner backed by a British military force.2
Others, more sensibly, might accept the need for involving the UN but still argue that Britain should act in anticipation of any UN approval. Ibelieve that both these courses should be rejected.    Despite our protestationsabout our intention to implement the AAP, and however genuine they were,to act in anticipation of UN support is to run a serious risk of putting us atodd8 with the international community and to find ourselves in a dispute with the Patriotic Front when the future for their armed men has not been negotiated and a ceasefire not guaranteed.7, I do not believe we should contemplate any action which does nothave as its basic premise going first to the Security Council and seeking the support of Africa and the international community.    If we wererebuffed in the UN by Soviet veto or intransigence then we might, and Istress might, have to face the issue of action without UN endorsement.I realise that we would face strong political pressures in Britain from someto go immediately into Rhodesia and assert our colonial responsibilities.To forestall this pressure it will be necessary for the Government to havea contingency plan for immediate action so that we lead public opinion fromthe outset.conclusion. I ask the approval of my colleagues:-a. to continue to try to bring About a negotiated settlement onthe basis of the AAP as elaborated in discussion between all theparties over the last year, and in particular to endorse, if it canbe negotiated, the Transitional Constitution in Annexes A and B;b. to continue to make it clear that a unilateral renunciation ofUDI changes nothing, unless it is clearly acknowledged that thefirst priority is a negotiated ceasefire and a settlement between all the parties;c. to treat a unilateral renunciation of UDI which is not based onthis acknowledgement, and on acceptance of the AAP as a basis for negotiation, as merely the transfer of power from one illegal regime to another illegal regime, and to demand negotiations andconvene a conference between the new regime and all the other parties;d. to welcome a unilateral renunciation of UDI only if it werefirmly based on acceptance of the broad principles of the AAPand agreement to negotiate a ceasefire.    In such circumstances:i.       to act by immediately calling an Emergency Meetingof the Security Council, circulate the draft UN Resolutionattached at Annex C for consultation with the Front Line andthe Patriotic Front, and immediately to puhlish the draft order-in-Council attached at Annex B;3
ii.       to recall Parliament immediately or, if an electionwas in progress, to discuss our action with all political parties in Britain;iii. to offer to contribute urgently to any UN peacekeepingforce at least one and possibly two battalions to addcredibility to the force and demonstrate our own commitment to our proposals;iv. to put in place a Resident Commissioner only when theSecurity Council and Parliament have endorsed our actionwhen there was a reasonable prospect of a genuine ceasefireor at least the clear assurance that Mozambique and Zambia,the host nations of ZANU and ZAPTJ respectively, would clampdown on any continued fighting.D A L OForeign and Commonwealth office September 19784

The Declaration of Rights
G.   The Declaration of Rights1*   The Transitional Constitution will contain aDeclaration of Rights substantially identical with theone which is to form part of the Constitution of Zimbabwe.2*   Subject to paragraph 5 of this Section, all laws inforce in Rhodesia, both those which are continued inforce as from the commencement of the TransitionalConstitution (see paragraph 1(a) of Section M) and thosewhich are made thereafter by the Council, will be valid0D-ly to the extent that they are consistent with thedeclaration of Rights, and all governmental actions andadministrative practices which are carried out thereafter^11 be lawful only to the extent that they are soconsistent.3*   The references in the Declaration of Rights which isto form part of the Constitution of Zimbabwe toCitizens of Zimbabwe1 will be replaced in the corres-Ponding provisions in the Transitional Constitution byReferences to 1 citizens of Rhodesia1 (or in some contextsto 1persons who are either citizens of Rhodesia or are,at the commencement of the Constitution, ordinarily andlawfully resident in Rhodesia&apos;).For the purposes of that provision in the Declarationof Rights which makes it permissible to derogate from cer-tain fundamental rights (and in particular to authorisedetention without trial) during a period of public emer-geacy, such a period will be deemed to exist during any period when there is in force a declaration to that effect made, before Independence, by the ResidentCoDimissioner or, after Independence, by the Council.h declaration of emergency will be deemed to be in force attQe commencement of the Transitional Constitution but may,of course, be revoked at any time thereafter.5&apos;   The effect of paragraph 2 above is that, in additionto the laws which will in any case cease tc have effect at the commencement of the Transitional Constitution inaccordance with paragraph 1(e) of Section M, all existing/security8

Similarly, any existing discriminatory law which.hasnot been expressly brought to an end as provided for.inparagraph 1(f) of Section W will prima facie be sutornabi-cally invalidated as from the commencement of the transitional Constitution because of its inconsistencywith the Declaration of Rights,   However, for practical reasons (as explained in paragraph 9(a) of Annex 15 toCmnd 6919) it may nob be possible to devise and introduce the necessary replacements for all such laws innediabelybn the comnencement of the Transitional Constitution, or indeed even at a later starve of the transition period.Accordingly, and without prejudice to the binding rocon-mentations of bhe Commission on Hunan nights (nee pnra-^raphs 7-10 below),  bhe Transitional Consbltuti&apos;&quot;: willprovide -(a) that it will be the duty of the Council, at thecirliesb date which it judges practicable, Un repealor, as the cane may require,  bo amend any law ro-riis-inr; in force after the oomnpnoemenb of the transitim-ilConstitution which appears bo bhe Council to ho dis-crininatory either of itself or in it5; effect; butOb) that in the meantime any such, law (or an;- subse-quent law amending it or roplacirj;; M* which *lo*s hrroliintroduce a greater degree of discrimination than pre-vioualy existed) will bo -saved from invalidation unW??hthe heclarabion of Rights dicing tlie six months trrin:biun period.7. There will be a Commission on Human Kightn, consisu-iug of ri Chairman, who must be a person jualified bn beappointed as a judge of the High Court, and .....other mborn.   The Members of the Commission will be appointed bybhe Council *
8. Once appointed, a member of the Commission will not be removablefrom office except on grounds of physical or mental disability (in which case the Council will be able to remove him on the advice of a tribunal,presided over by a High Court judge, which it has appointed to enquire into that matter).     If a member of the Commission is removed fromoffice or dies or resigns his office, the Council will appoint areplacement.9. It will be the duty of the Commission to carry out,during the transition period, an urgent examination ofaH laws and administrative practices which were in force at thecommencement of the Transitional Constitution and have notsubsequently been terminated or appropriately amended andwhich the Commission consider may -(a) be incompatible with the Declaration of Rights;or(b) be otherwise unnecessarily harsh or repressive;or(c) involve discrimination which would, but for the provisiondescribed in paragraph 6(b) above, be invalid as incompatible with the Declaration of Rights, and to make recommendations assoon as possible to the Council concerning the laws and practices which it considers should be terminated or amended.10*   On receipt of the recommendations of the Commission, theCouncil will be obliged to enact, as soon as possible, legislationgiving effect to those recommendations and to take, as soonas possible, any other executive action which the recommendationsCall for or which the Council considers necessary or expedient to implement them.    It will be the specific duty of the Councilto take all necessary steps to ensure that any action required a recommendation of the Commission is made effective not later than six months after the commencement of the Transitionalinstitution except that, in the case of a discriminatory law0r Practice, the Commission may recommend that its termination0r amendment should take effect from some later date (not in any circumstances later than two years)after the commencement of the/Constitution10

Wbern ibn  Cowijijf priori has recommended net:ion by a Inter date,  the duty In tatfethat action will be adjusted accordingly, and T.h&apos;n thedate falls after the commencement, of the Const.&apos; tut action of  Zimbabwe, the duty.will be left to be discharged bythe Government established by thajt Constitution. (ItIs proposed that the Independence.of Zimbabwe should provide that all discriminatory laws and practices,whether   or not they have been the subject of n recom-mendation by the Commission, will in any event beinvalidated not later than two years after the commencennnt of that Constitution.)11.   The rights guaranteed by the Declaration of Tligbtrwill be fully justiciable and the High Court will, hnvoall necessary powers and jurisdiction for that purpose./II.    The Public Service11
H.      The Public ServiceAll powers concerning appointments made to public offices, disciplinary control over persons holding oracting in such offices and their removal from office will be vested in the Council or, subject to the general direction and control of the Council, in such minister as the Council may for the time being designate for thatpurpose.    Subject to any law   made by the Council, theywill also be exercisable by the like authorities and inthe like manner, as nearly as may be, as they were immediately before the commencement of the TransitionalConstitution but the exercise by those authorities ofany such power will be subject to any general or specialdirection which the Council, or the Minister for the timebeing designated for that purpose, may give. Thisparagraph does not apply to Judges of the High Court(who are dealt with in Section F) or to members of any military or air force or police force (who are dealt within Section I).2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of this Section, theCouncil may at any time require any public officer (otherthan a Judge of the High Court) to retire in order tofacilitate the reconstruction of the public service. Anyofficer so required to retire will then qualify to receivethe special privileges in respect of retirement benefitsthat are described in sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 3 ofthis Section.3. The retirement benefits payable in respect of theservice of any person in a public office will be protected as follows:(a)    The law regulating the payment of such benefitswill be the law in force on a specified date (insome cases the date of commencement of the TransitionalConstitution and in other cases the date on which theservice began) or any later law not less favourable tothe person concerned./(b)
(h)    All such payments will be a charge on the consolidated Revenue Fund.(c)   Public officers who, under paragraph 2 of thisSection, were required to retire in order to facilitate the reconstruction of the public service will betreated for retirement benefit purposes, as if theyhad retired on abolition of office, and the benefitspayable in their case will be freely remittableabroad.Sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) will apply in respect ofservice as a Judge of the High Court, service in a military or air force or police force, and service in the employmentof certain statutory corporations in the same way as they apply in respect of service in an ordinary office in thecivil service, and they will apply in respect of service before the commencement of the Transitional Constitution(including service since 11 November 1965) as well as inrespect of future service.4.     The Position as regards the status, as from the commence-ment of the Transitional Constitution, of persons who wereserving as public officers immediately before then is dealtwith in paragraph 4 of Section M./I.
