SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(78) 83 COPY NO gQ19 July 1978CABINETPAY POLICY AFTER JULYNote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer\* I attach a revised draft of the White Paper:  &quot;The Attack onInflation:  The Future Course&quot;.2* I shall be circulating as soon as possible a draft of the statement which I would propose to make on Friday, 21 July, at 11.00 am, when theWhite Paper would also be published.     The statement will give opportunity*or some points of political presentation which may be less appropriate inthe White Paper itself.In revising the draft White Paper, I have adopted the suggestion ofthe Secretary of State for Transport, supported by several other colleagues,for a crisper introductory passage, incorporating the key figure and this hasinvolved considerable recasting of other parts of the earlier draft.    As faras possible in the revised structure, I have taken account of other detaileddrafting suggestions and am grateful to colleagues for the comments they made.dividends^* The revised draft incorporates (paragraph 30) a substantive passageon dividend control.    I have had further consultations with David Steel; he thinks the Liberals will abstain or even support us if we propose new legislation to prolong the statutory control on dividends providing this is done in the context of a firm pay policy.    In these circumstances, I thinkthat the best course is to prolong the existing statutory controls for a further*2 months.    After consultation with the Lord President, I propose to publish the necessary Bill on Friday 21 July, the same day as the White Paper; itcan then be taken in the House of Commons on 27 July and the House of lords on 28 July.^* I propose that the extended controls should be as they are now,except for a new provision which is briefly described in paragraph 30 of theattached draft. This will relieve pressure in cases where the presentcontrols bite very severely. Only companies which are very successful inProfit terms from now on will be able to take advantage of it, and it will not permit the very large proportional increases in dividends associated withPayment of accumulated backlog which we fear would occur if controls cameof* altogether.D WHAreasury Chambers18 July 1978SECRET
DRAFT :  18 JULY 1978THE ATTACK ON INFLATION : THE FUTURE COURSEIntroduction1. In the past year, inflation has come down from 17 per cent the lowest for almost, six years. .to around o per cent/. This dramatic success has been partly dueto a higher exchange rate and static world food prices. TheGovernment&apos;s monetary and fiscal policies have also played a vitalrole.    But it was the firm pay policies over the past three years, and.the responsible co-operation by employers andin observing themtrade unions/,whicn made the achievement possible.2. These policies have gained wide support as people have experienced the real advantages to be gained from a sustainedattack on inflation.    Reducing the rate of inflation by negotiatingmoderate pay settlements does not mean tightening belts and making sacrifices.    Real living standards have been rising.Moderate gains in real wages have been supplemented by tax cutsand better child benefits for those in work.    Those who dependon pensions and other social benefits have more than held the realadvances they have gained since 1974.3. Taking account of all the fiscal changes from last Octoberonwards, for a family with two children under eleven, mother notworking and father earning  75 &amp; week the fiscal changes alone willprovide an increase in net income of some 6     per cent, rising to over8    per cent when the Child Benefit increase comes in during november.    For the same family where the father earns  50 a week,just overthe increase is greater;/ cl  r oer cent up to the Child Benefit- /ST 4-     i? with.no childrenincrease, when it rises to/11     per cent.    For a married couple/,just .under 5wife not working, the fiscal changes are worth /     per cent if the.overhusband earns  75 a week and/6     per cent if he earns  50 a week.&apos; For pensioners, the increase in the married couples1 retirement pension to  28 last November has meant an improvement in purchasing
power of over 15 per cent since the previous Government1s lastuprating in October 1973-    Those dependent on other social benefitshave also experienced an improvement in real terms over the sameperiod - some 7 per cent for single parents receiving long-termsupplementary benefit for example.   Short-term supplementary benefit for a family for two children is now 4- per cent higher in real terms.And there will be further increases in all these benefits in November./Tor all these groups the slowing-down of the rate of inflation means a very great deal.create more jobs and4. A lower rate of inflation is also essential if we are to/keepBritish goods competitive, both at home and abroad.In the past year, at a time of great difficulty in world markets, British exports have more than held their share of theworld total.    Over most of the last year, the trend of unemployment has been slowly but firmly downwards.    These improvement mustbe continued if we are to achieve a high wage, high output, highemployment economy.5. Although at around 8 per cent our current inflation rateis about the average for industrial countries and lower, forexample, than that of France and Canada it is still considerably higher than some of our most active competitors like Germany and japan.    The inflation rate is the product of changes in severalfactors.   V/e can have little influence over those which are external,such as basic commodity prices, but these are the same for our competitors.    The rate of exchange and the level of taxation requiredto sustain the social wage themselves depend to a large extent onthe rate of inflation as well as contributing to it.    The othermain factors, which are within our power as a country to influence,are dividends, productivity and labour costs.    Our proposals regarding dividends are set out in paragraph 30, and productivityis the subject of paragraph 20.    The latest indications are thatunit labour costs in the United Kingdom are now growing faster than in other major countries, while productivity overall remainslower despite the gains made in some cases in the current round.2
Unless there is a noticeable improvement in the growth of productivityor a substantial decrease in the growth of money earnings - andpreferably both - unit labour costs in the United Kingdom willcontinue to grow too fast and inflation will once again start onan upward spiral.6. Our gains so far will all be lost if we fail to build onour success.    12 months ago, the Government set a guideline forthe growth of earnings of 10 per cent - very much lower thanthe increase in the RPI over the previous year at that time. In factearnings will prove to have risen somewhat higher than this.Part of the excess has arisen from self-financing productivitydeals and will not raise prices;    on the contrary, it will contribute to that improvement in our industrial performancewhich is our prime objective.    But if we do no better in thecoming year than in the past year, inflation will be driven back into double figures, the competitiveness which we are only justholding will be undermined, and we could all too easily seeprices and incomes spiralling upwards again, dashing our hopes of reducing unemployment.7. So the earnings target for next year must be substancially lower.   Only in this way can we be sure of making the presentsuccess a lasting one.    The Government has therefore decidedto adopt a pay policy to apply from 1 August, 1978 in which theguideline will be set at 5 per cent.8. This may seem an ambitious objective.    But in many of ourcompetitor countries settlements have been at or below this level.With determination there is no reason why we cannot return to thesame standards ourselves.9. It is the Governments view that the country should aim. at a long-term approach in which collective bargaining is basedeach year on a broad agreement between Government, unions and employers about the maximum level of earnings which is compatible3
Wltu keeping inflation under control in the following 12 months.^e Policy for next year has been shaped so as to permit atransition to such longer term arrangements.J2Z8-79 Pay Round10The Government has discussed the coming pay round with thefpTT/iwhose partnership in the attack on inflation has been of vitallmPortance.    These discussions have taken place in the contexto feconomic and social policy as a whole. The Government has foundSuoh consultations valuable in widening its understanding of thes point of view and achieving a broad measure of consensus0n economic and social objectives.    The Government intends to keepln close and continuous consultation with the trade union movement0n the whole range of its economic policies.    The CBI and otherko-uies have also been consulted and their views too are reflected111 Parts of this White Paper.    There was general agreement amongstconcerned on the economic objectives to be pursued for jobs,prices and output.11( *   Moreover, the Government has an inescapable responsibility tolndicate the level of growth in earnings which it considers to be appropriate for the coming pay-round and consistent with preventing.   lncrease in the rate of inflation.    It is itself directly or^^rectly involved in pay bargaining for the public sector - somebil^61, cent of the labour force - and it has overriding responsi--^y for  -ne economic welfare of the nation as a whole.    It wouldneither fair nor practicable for the Government to set a guide-for earnings growth in the public sector and leave the private^ctor subject only to the constraint of market forces. Britain0fS a highly structured and interlocking wage system, each sectionit W^Cn has repercussions on others.    These considerations makenecessary for the Government to give guidance for the wholeeconomy.
;ers is12.   In these circumstances the Government&apos;s duty is to advocate aPolicy which provides the best possible foundation for a further reduction in inflation, an increase in jobs and output, and an improved standard of living.   In achieving that end what matte.-^e total increase, from all sources, in the average earnings ofthe group concerned and other costs required to be taken intoaccount.   Settlements must be assessed for this purpose on the basisor past experience.   In the Government-s view, the total increase for any group compared with the previous year (apart from thoseexceptions described elsewhere in this White Paper) should not be&quot;ore than 5 per cent.1 XIn formulating its policy the Government has had to reconcilettle need to contain inflation with the need for flexibility in payiiD v* *Saming.    Each of the last two rounds of pay policy has been moreexible than its predecessor.    The rigid  6 round was replacedy Qne with a guideline of 5 per cent, within a floor of  2.50 andj Cei^ing of  A.    This in turn gave way to a guideline of 10 per cent^   &quot;the 10 per cent round the kitty principle enabled negotiatorsstructure their settlements in whatever way suited theirCll,cumstances and many used this flexibility, for example to0nsoliua-te into basic rates the supplements outstanding from thef^eV^0US ^wo rounc*s-    ^e Government wishes to continue this^^^ility and has framed the earnings guideline accordingly. But^vernment cannot ensure that the flexibility it offers is fullyUsed * 4.: this is the responsibility of employers and unions, who shouldpe their settlements in a way best suited to meeting their specialaeeds.14% in varying degreesJ-he pay policies of the past three years have/ inhibitedthe adjustment of internal pay structures and externalej-a&quot;tivities that would otherwise have occurred.    However, evenwbere h^        desirable, such adjustments must not be allowed to promotehogging claims.    Where they are absolutely necessary the
flexibility which is provided by the provisions in this White paper and which was largely present in the previous guidelines - notably the ability for negotiators to adjust internal pay structures withinthe overall limit on increases for the group or groups concerned -offers an effective means for dealing with many of them progressively.This flexibility should be increasingly used for this purpose.15. Nevertheless, the Government has recognised in a small numberof cases - firemen, police, the Armed Forces, others covered byReview Bodies, and university teachers - that some exceptionalincrease is needed.    The pay of the groups concerned is traditionallydetermined very largely by external comparisons and this processwas interrupted by the introduction of the  6 policy in July 1975-In each case the necessary increase has already been identifiedand quantified on the basis of independent recommendations, and thebalance over and above the guidelines increase in the current roundis to be paid in two equal stages on the next two annual settlementdates for the group concerned.   Each stage is estimated to resultin total in an increase in national earnings of the order of only0.15 per cent.16. It may be that there is a small number of groups in a similarposition for whom like treatment might be appropriate whenthey reach their settlement date.    If so, theremust be priorclearance through the Department of Employment or, for public sectorgroups, through sponsor Departments.    It would be self-defeatingif more than a few groups were accorded such exceptional treatment,and the Government will therefore examine   any proposals put forwardvery critically to see how far the same considerations apply.Clearance will normally be given only if the pay for the groupconcerned has traditionally been determined by objective externalcomparisons with the pay of other groups doing comparable workrequiring comparable degrees of skill;    and if the application ofsuch comparisons on thebasis of independent recommendations showsthat the traditional relativities have been interrupted by theintroduction of the  6 policy in July 1975-6
V.   Although families on low incomes will benefit significantlyfrom the general reduction in the rate of inflation, the Government^cognises their special needs.   However, the recent report of theRoyal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth showed that only some 40 per cent of lower incomes families have income from earnings.   For those dependent on State benefits, the arrange-*ents already in force ensure that these benefits are protected against inflation, and in some cases are increased in real terms.10 help the lowest earners, however, the Government would see noobjection if the minimum rates prescribed by statutory Wages Councils*ere to be increased by rather larger percentages where relativelysn*ll cash sums were involved.   The Government expects those on higher earnings in the same or other industries to accept the^sequential relative improvement in the position of the lowestPaid..Sgtti Sent dates18*   Responsible collective bargaining must preserve an orderlyDa*tern of settlements through the maintenance of existingPractices as regards the date of settlements.19 p-&quot;or these reasons the Government looks to those concerned^termination in the public and private sector to respecteir existing annual settlement date.    Theremay be an exceptionale where a highly fragmented bargaining situation needs to bea^0nalised.    The Government will be prepared to consider such a casethe basis that the overall level of the settlement takes accountof a*ny costs involved,^ctiyit;The Industrial Strategy is dedicated to increasing Britishry s share of home and overseas markets by improving productivity0Ur COm^e^^tiveness through higher investment and better use ofReductive resources.    By supporting investment projects under1
Section 8 of the Industry Act 1972, the Government has made a ma0o.contribution towards improving the level and direction of ^estmentin British manufacturing industry.   But the evidence from the Sectorirking Parties shows also that major improvements must be made m^e way industrial assets are used.   Pay policy has a role to play in achieving these improvements.   First, the flexibility providedhy the kitty principle makes it possible to adjust pay structuresWithin the overall limit to meet changing technological -quxxements^condly, in the current pay round there have been examples of markedincreases in productivity through self-financing productivity deals.*he Government has therefore decided to continue providing for suchQeals in the next round, on the same conditions - that any dealthis nature should never increase unit costs and so far as pos-ibleshould reduce them.   It must be demonstrated to be self-fmancingbcfore any payments are made, and payments should continue only iX^SUlar checrconfirm that it is still self-financing.   The savxngsgenerated by such deals should be shared between the workers, the enterprise, and consumers, so that they may contribute towards thecest of other pay increases, assist investment and restrain prices.&apos;   Much attention has been focussed on the possibility of^Qg working hours and the contribution this could make to^Uc .       ^        opportunities.    The Government welcomes the recentlnitiative on the reduction of overtime working. There^Pears to be significant scope - particularly in those areaserQPloyment in which overtime has recently increasedVo k.   t:*&quot;a&quot;^y &quot; :for additional jobs in substitution for overtimeln6 at no increased cost.    There could also be scope foruion in working hours without loss of individual earningsrevised shift arrangements or other working practices makein additional job opportunity with a corresponding increase^Put, and overall unit costs are not increased.    In many areas8\
industrial plant is less intensively and effectively used inthe United Kingdom than in some competing countries, and moves inthis direction could contribute towards the high-income, high output,high-employment economy which is our objective.The introduction to this White Paper has emphasised theimportance of our unit costs, particularly labour costs in relationto Productivity, by comparison with those of other countries, andthe question of hours generally is an important element in theseCosts.   if more people were employed to produce the same outputWlthout any reduction in individual earnings, labour costs wouldlQevitably be that much higher.    For example, a reduction from 4-00 39 hours, other things being equal, would result in an increaselri labour costs of over 2-J- per cent.    The consequent price increasesWoulH moreuj-q- reduce sales and lead to/unemployment even if our mainC0D1Petitors in home as well as overseas markets were adopting^ilar changes.    The Government has indeed taken the initiativediscussions within the European Community to encourage parallelesi but must emphasise the dangers for the UK in increasing0sts through reductions in hours in advance of our competitors.^3. *   In general, therefore, the Government can accept a reductionhours as part of a normal pay settlement on condition that its ^onstrated that the settlement as a whole does not lead toanyQCrease in unit costs above what would have resulted from a^ight guideline settlement on pay.    Indeed the cost of any0vement in conditions of employment such as holidays, hoursxringe benefits must count towards the level of settlements -pe ^SC^ ^0        same exceptions as in the current round for improvedSlon benefits, sick pay, job security, etc. - save in so far asLQst involved is fully offset by increased productivity, in which case. 4.-L,-mis must be subject to all the conditions applied to otherctivity deals, including regular checking.
 hg &quot;Public sector the Government will do everything possible to secure that full account is taken of the guidance in this White Paper throughoutthe public sector.    The cash limits for 1978-79 have already been published in Cmnd 7161 and no general changes in them are planned*s a result of this White Paper.    For 1979-80 the assumptions^ed for the cash limits will reflect the Government&apos;s policy on pay.?heITivate sectorIn the private sector the Government relies on employers and unions to act responsibly and moderately, as the CBI and the TUChave given assurance they will.    In the light of these assurances^he Government trusts it will not be necessary to use its^scretionary powers in support of the guidelines.    However, these powers will still exist and they will be used if necessary. the clauses in existing Government contracts will remain in force,nd they will continue to be included in new contracts.Th^^Sgjiuneration^ Charges and Grants Act, 1975^*   The provisions of the Remuneration, Charges and Grants Act^ s expire on 31 July 1978 and the Government does not proposeo^ Seek their renewal.    It is recognised that in some cases^servance of the guidelines in this White Paper may conflict with^   sting contractual obligations.    This should, however, be muchess widespread in the coming pay round than in the past three^    0%    where such cases arise it is open to the parties concernedtoake the necessary modifications by mutual arrangements andSe ^ overnment would expect them to do so.   The provisions ofl0n 1 of the Act are therefore no longer required.The Government regards continuing price control as anant part of the Attack on Inflation.    The Price Commission10
Act 1977, which has been in force since last August, replaceda detailed and inevitably inflexible Price Code related to additionalcosts with a policy under which the Price Commission reportsselectively on individual companies and industries whose pricingPntna facie justifies investigation.    We are now seeing the resultsof this new policy.28-   Between August 1977 and June 1978 the Price Commissionlnitiated 24- investigations into pricing by individual enterprises,0^ which 18 have been completed.    In 15 of these the price increasesSoUght were wholly or partly restricted during the investigation;ln 9 cases prices are being held or restricted for variousperiods after the investigation.    At the same time action has beent^ken to follow up Price Commission examinations of sectors oflndustry.    This has led to reductions or restrictions in the pricestea, coffee, and beer.    In the nationalised industries, assewhere, price increases have been far lower than for several*^s*   Rebates worth  100m have been returned to telephoneeribers.   No major increases are expected in nationalisedlridustry prices for the remainder of this year.^*   Over the coming months the Price Commission will maintainetive programme of investigations into individual companies,will also examine, at the direction of the Government, pricingnces m different sectors of industry.    In addition, theto    existence of the Price Commission encourages companiesexamine carefully the justification for price increases.0raPanies may be induced to withdraw or reduce notified increasesavoid investigation.   All this in turn influences leading^competitors, suppliers and trade customers of the enterpriseerned.   At the same time the Price Commission is required by-*-av/ 4-Q^   0 discharge its functions in a way which takes account of other^^^-^es in our national economic policy.    The Commissioninv   ^aVe reSard, among other matters, to the promotion of newstment and technological innovation, the encouragement of11
industrial efficiency, the appropriate level of profits and dividendsand the interests of consumers.   Thus the Commission not only hasa duty to identify excessive price increases and to recommend the steps needed to correct them, but also in doing so to take full account of the wider economic background against which such price increases are put forward.30.   The present statutory powers to control dividends expire on31 July 1978    The Government intends to introduce a Bill toe*tend the statutory control for a further 12 months from&apos; August 1978 on the present basis and with the present provisions for exceptions and with one addition.    This is that from 1 August 1978 no company will beSquired by the controls to increase its dividend cover above the^Bhest level achieved since the current controls began. This wille^ble companies to increase their dividends in line with profits0r ^ line with the statutory limit, whichever is the higher, but will not be permitted to distribute funds accumulated m theA separate announcement giving details of this provisionvill be made.31. lris moderation is not exercised in the coming round inflation^ certain to increase, with consequences for confidence and exchange rate which would be highly damaging to our economy.Vernment could not stand aside in such circumstances. It0Uld -koe obliged to take fiscal and monetary action to removefuel from inflation.    Such action would inevitably haveeri r,be    US e:L^ec&quot;ts on output.   A large number of companies could in eX^ectcc* to S0 bankrupt;    there would be a substantial increase&quot;U unemployment-J-0YDient;    and there might well be a step change to a-Level of economic activity from which it would be difficult12
to recover.   This is an unappealing course, which the Governmentwould follow with extreme reluctance.   But it would have no choiceif the alternative was a return to the spiralling inflation of1974-75;   for that would be even more damaging to output andemployment and would also offer no hope of escape in the rising inflation would bear particularly hard on those sectionsthe community which are least able to defend themselves.32-   The guidelines set out in this White Paper offer a faroetter course - the opportunity for pay negotiators to use thexrfreedom in reaching settlements with responsibility and -o^ratxonto consolidate the success of the last three years.   They can do so&quot;ith confidence that this, within the framework of the Government seontinuing monetary and other policies, will build on the solxdfoundations which have already been laid for economic growth.Jt will encourage the regeneration of industry, guarantee Ixyxngstandards and make possible a continuing fall in unemployment,Paging lasting benefits to all sections of the communxty.13
