Section I: introduction. The purpose of this White Paper is to report developments in theEuropean Community in the period from 1 January to 30 June 1978, inaccordance with the recommendation of the Select Committee on european community Secondary Legislation in its second report of the 1972-73 Session.The report gives a factual account of events and developments duringthe period of the Danish Presidency of the Community.2. The main theme of Community activity in the six months coveredby this report continued to be the fight against inflation and unemployment.Following the Prime Ministers definition in March of a Five-Point plan for action on the world economy covering higher growth, improved currencystability, energy, trade and long-term capital flows including aid, the EuropeanCouncil agreed at Copenhagen on 7-8 April to develop a common strategy for tackling the adverse trends in the Community&apos;s economic and socialsituation, with the specific objective of a growth rate of A\ per cent by themiddle of 1979. Work on the various aspects of the strategy was pursuedurgently in a number of Councils Finance, Foreign Affairs, Energy, social affairs, Development as well as in other Community bodies. The Presidencyreported on progress to the Foreign Ministers who were able to identify the outstanding issues in preparation for the European Council meeting in Bremen in July. The Bremen meeting itself fell outside the period covered in this report, but the conclusions reached by Heads of Govera-ment across the whole range of issues covered by the common strategyvindicated the concerted and carefully organised preparations that hadbeen made.3. In the commercial and industrial sector, the main preoccupations ofthe Community continued to be the problems of key industries such as steel and textiles which had been affected by recession and over-capacity. TheCommission gave approval for a modified Temporary Employment subsidy in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom continued to benefit fromloans from the European Investment Bank and the European Coal andSteel Community, as well as from grants made available from the regional development and social funds. New provisions introduced as a result oflast year&apos;s review of the tasks of the social fund came into force on1 January. The Finance Council completed its work on the details of thenew Community borrowing scheme to aid investments which had beenapproved in principle by last Decembers European Council.4. The Government continued to pursue the aim of reform of theCommon Agricultural Policy with particular emphasis on the need to reducesurpluses. The common agricultural prices for 1978-79 agreed by theCouncil of Ministers in May reflected the lowest average increase in commonsupport prices since United Kingdom accession to the Community about per cent. Other key features of the package of measures agreed in theprice settlement of importance to the United Kingdom were arrangements for safeguarding the future of the milk marketing boards, and the extension of
the Community-financed butter and school milk subsidies. The UnitedKingdom had already obtained agreement in the Council in January to a1\ per cent devaluation in the green pound. Negotiations on both internal and external fisheries arrangements continued throughout the period: therewas some progress in external arrangements, but regrettably little sign of readiness on the part of other Member States to move towards an acceptablesettlement of the internal regime.5. The European Council at its meeting in Copenhagen agreed that thefirst direct elections to the European Assembly should take place between7 and 10 June 1979, and adopted a declaration on the democratic principles which are regarded as essential elements of the European heritage for both present and future members of the Community. In the UnitedKingdom, the European Assembly Elections Bill completed its Parliamentarystages and became law in early May.6. Enlargement of the Community continued to be a main theme of theCommunity&apos;s activity, and progress was made in the substantive negotiations with began in February on the terms of Greek Accession. The Commissionissued its Opinion on the Portuguese application for membership in Mayand the Council agreed that negotiations with Portugal should start assoon as practicable after the summer break.7. Work began during this period on preparing the Community&apos;s position for the forthcoming renegotiations of the Lome Convention. The Communityalso contributed within the United Nations Framework to continuing workon the North-South Dialogue, and was engaged in intensive discussions withother main participants in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations, which are intended to be completed by the end of the year.Section II:   Political Co-operation8. Member States continued discussion of a wide range of foreign policy issues, including the Middle East and Cyprus. The Nine consulted closelythroughout the Belgrade follow-up meeting to the Conference on security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and frequently adopted common positions on the major issues involved in negotiating the Final Document. following the meeting, which ended on 9 March, the Nine embarked on a series of joint studies covering various aspects of the CSCE process. These studieswill form part of the Nine&apos;s preparations for the second CSCE follow-upmeeting which will open in Madrid in 1980.9. The Nine continued to develop a common approach towards Africa.They determined to work for peaceful change in South Africa and consideredwhat further practical measures they might adopt to achieve this. Theydiscussed the arrangements for putting into effect the Code of Conduct forcompanies with interests in South Africa adopted last September; on 25 May,the British Government published a White Paper setting out the UnitedKingdom&apos;s arrangements. The Nine supported the Anglo-American initiativeon Rhodesia and the proposals on Namibia of the five Western members ofthe Security Council.
10. The Nine considered how to acquaint the prospective new membersof the Community with the procedures and substance of Political Co-operation.A first step was taken when, at the 7th Ministerial Session of the Greekaccession negotiations on 26 June, the Presidency made a formal statement to the Greek delegation on the subject of Political Cooperation. Similarcommunications will be made to Spain and Portugal when their accessionnegotiations begin. The three applicant states will not become full participantsin Political Co-operation until after ratification of their respective accessiontreaties.11. At the same time the Nine considered how to strengthen contacts with turkey over matters covered by Political Cooperation. Ministers agreed on12 June that there should be a reciprocal exchange of information with Turkeyon these subjects.Section III:   Enlargement, External Relations, Trade and AidEnlargement12. Substantive negotiations on the terms for Greece&apos;s entry into theCommunity began in February. Meetings of the e.c./Greece NegotiatingConference were held monthly at Ambassadorial level and there were twoMinisterial meetings. A good deal of progress was made, although thediscussions did not at this stage cover some major sectors such as agriculture.The Commission tabled in May its Opinion on Portugal^ application for membership. The Council considered the Opinion in June, when it decidedto open negotiations with Portugal as soon as possible in the Autumn.Work on preparing the Commission^ Opinion on Spain continued. TheCommission submitted in March a report on the general implications ofenlargement (the &quot; fresco &quot;).General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GAIT): Multilateral TradeNegotiations13. Following the tabling of substantive negotiating offers in January bythe Community and other major participating countries both on tariffs andon non-tariff measures, the Community played an increasingly important and very active role in both the formal and informal discussions which charac-terised the negotiations. There was substantial progress amongst the majorparties on many of the issues including a selective safeguard mechanism,on the texts of several codes including customs valuation, standards,government procurement and subsidies and countervailing, and on the framework for arrangements for dairy products and meat. Negotiationsproceeded in parallel on an arrangement for wheat, including a new food aid convention, and for coarse grain. At the Council of Ministers on 27 June,the Community agreed its stance for the final phase of negotiations.Textiles14. Arrangements with Mediterranean suppliers, which are less clearly defined than those with countries which have initialled bilateral agreementsunder the renewed Multifibre Arrangement, gave rise to a general problem
in the period under review. As a result consultations took place withPortugal, Spain and Greece with a view to tightening these arrangements.Particular regard was paid to the levels of imports and the possibility ofsafeguard action.Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)15. In the 1978 GSP, the least developed group of countries was givenespecially favourable treatment. For textiles, the arrangements for the first six months of 1978 were renewed and will apply similarly to the last sixmonths of 1978.Japan16. The Community maintained its efforts to develop a closer relationship with Japan and to resolve the current trading problems which continue to cause concern in the Community. Discussions in the first three months ofthe year led to high level consultations in March during which the JapaneseGovernment outlined its economic targets for the next financial year: progress was reviewed at the high level consultations in June.Association of Sooth East Asian Nations (ASEAN)17. The Community agreed that, as part of the dialogue with ASEAN,there should be a meeting at Ministerial level with the ASEAN countries inNovember.China18. A Trade Agreement between the People&apos;s Republic of China and theCommunity was signed in Brussels on 3 April. The Agreement is intendedto develop trade and economic relations between the Community and Chinaand provides for most-favoured-nation treatment. A Joint Committee was setup to monitor the agreement and examine new opportunities for trade.Yugoslavia19. The Commission opened negotiations with Yugoslavia on the formand content of a new agreement to replace the existing e.c./YugoslaviaTrade Agreement which was due for renewal in August 1978. The Councildiscussed in June a broadening of the negotiating mandate to assist theconclusion of a satisfactory agreement.Relations between the Community and the Council for Mutual economic assistance (CMEA)20. Further discussions with the Council for Mutual Economic assistance on an e.c./CMEA agreement took place in Moscow in May. The establish-ment of direct communication between the two organisations which began in 1974 should lead to a better working relationship with both the CMEAand its Member States.Lome Convention21. The Third ACP/e.c. Council of Ministers meeting was held in brussels on 13-14 March. Ministers reviewed the whole range of currentLome&quot; business, and had a useful exchange of views on matters arising fromthe North/South dialogue.
22. The ACP/ e.c. Joint Committee, a subordinate body of the ACP / EECConsultative Assembly, held its third meeting in Grenada from 29 May to3 June. The Assembly debated a number of matters relating to the presentConvention and its impending renegotiation.23. Preparation began in April of the Community&apos;s position for the renegotiation of the Lome Convention which was formally opened in July.Mediterranean24. Two supplementary protocols with Cyprus were signed during thisperiod, covering a new set of arrangements for agricultural exports from cyprus to the Community. Negotiations continued with Spain, on a new agreement to replace the existing e.c./Spain trade agreement which datesfrom 1970.Latin America25. The latest session of the Community&apos;s Dialogue with the latin american countries took place at Ambassadorial level in Brussels on 29 June.Approval was given to a preliminary analysis of e.c./Latin America tradetrends over the past twenty years, and the Joint Working Party of Expertson Trade Questions was instructed to produce a final report by the time ofthe next session of the Dialogue at the end of 1978. There was also ageneral discussion on developments in the world economic situation and thestate of relations between the e.c. and the Latin American countries.Australia26. The Commission held talks on 8-9 June with the Australian Ministerfor Special Trade Representations. One of the main items for discussion was an Australian memorandum handed to the Commission in October 1977containing requests mostly relating to trade in agricultural produce. Mostof the issues raised by both sides will be pursued in the Multilateral trade negotiations as well as in further bilateral contacts.North/South dialogue27. The Community made a substantial written and oral contributionto the first meeting in New York from 3-13 May of the new United nations committee set up with representatives of all member countries by theGeneral Assembly last December to take an &apos; overview&apos; of the North/SouthDialogue (the United Nations Committee of the Whole). The Communityalso contributed to the Ministerial meeting in Geneva from 6-10 Marchof the Trade and Development Board of the United Nations Conferenceon Trade, Aid and Development (UNCTAD), where agreement was reached on an important resolution on the debt and development problems of the developing countries.Aid to non-associated developing countries28. On 25 April the Council of Ministers agreed on a regulation to govern financial and technical aid to non-associated developing countries,subject to conciliation proceedings with the European Assembly.  Aid is to510933 b*
go in general to the poorest countries, and their poorest people, with priority for rural development and improving food production. The Council also agreed on general guidelines for the 1978 programme for non-associates.29. The Commission released its proposals for the re-organisation of community food aid management. Essentially they foresee a CouncilWorking Group for food aid policy questions and a Management Committeeto assist the Commission in the day to day running of the programme.30. The Council of Ministers agreed an allocation of 31,000 tonnes ofdried skimmed milk and 12,700 tonnes of butter oil this year to helpdevelop the dairy industry in India under Operation Dairy Flood II, withintotal programmes of 150,000 and 45,000 tonnes respectively.Section IV : Agriculture and FisheriesCAP price fixing31. The Commission^ proposals for common prices in 1978/79 and related measures were presented in December 1977, considered at each subsequent Council, and debated in the House of Lords on 20 March andthe House of Commons on 21 March. A settlement was reached at theCouncil meeting on 8-12 May which held the average increase in commonsupport prices to just over 2-1 per cent. This is the lowest increase sinceUnited Kingdom accession to the Community. In several Member States,however, the increase was enhanced by green rate changes. When combined with the 7\ per cent green pound devaluation which was agreed at theCouncil meeting on 31 January, the effect of the settlement was to addabout 0-5 per cent eventually to the Retail Price Index while UnitedKingdom producers benefited from an increase in support prices of about10 per cent.Monetary arrangements32. During the period under review Ministers agreed to 6 per cent and5 per cent devaluations of the Italian green lira; 1*2 per cent and 7-1 percent devaluations of the French green franc (although the latter was partlydelayed until the 1979/80 marketing year for sectors other than pigmeat); a6 per cent devaluation of the Irish green pound; and a 1\ per cent devaluationof the United Kingdom green pound. The German green mark wasrevalued by 0-3 per cent.33. At its meeting on 8-12 May the Council concluded its discussions onthe Commission proposal for a 7-year schedule of green rate changes byagreeing simply that it should have as its objective, &quot; steady progress towardsthe reduction of monetary compensatory amounts in the light of a satis-factory price policy and the development of a more stable relationship between Community currencies&quot;. At the same meeting, the Commissionaccepted the case for a 10 per cent cut in monetary compensatory amountsfor certain processed goods.
Milk and milk products34. As part of the CAP prices settlement, support prices in the dairysector were increased by 2 per cent, and a decision was taken to reduce theco-responsibility levy on milk producers from 1 - 5 per cent to 0 - 5 per cent of the target price. Measures were also adopted to help improve the balance between supply and demand in the dairy sector. These included anextension of the Community-financed butter subsidy for the United Kingdom;an increase in the level of the school milk subsidy and in the range ofeligible products; and improved incentives to dairy farmers to give up milk production.Milk marketing boards35. At its meeting on 8-12 May the Council agreed to measures whichfully and permanently safeguard the position of the United Kingdom milk marketing boards.Beef and veal36. The examination of the Commissions report on the relative merits of beef premiums and intervention continued. As part of this review itwas agreed, in the context of the CAP price fixing negotiations, that the intervention system should be modified to allow it to operate more flexibly,and that the beef premiums scheme should continue for the 1978/79marketing year.Pigmeat37. In June the Council agreed to reduce the intervention price forpigmeat from 85 per cent to 78 per cent of the basic price. The effect ofthis was to reduce monetary compensatory amounts on pigmeat by about per centMutton and lamb38. In April the Commission published proposals for common arrange-ments in the market for mutton and lamb. The Council discussed therequirements for a common organisation in June, when the United Kingdomstressed that if there had to be a common market organisation theproposals provided a reasonable starting point for negotiation; but thatany measures agreed should protect the interests of producers and consumers and put no new restrictions on imported supplies. Theproposals were referred to experts for further examination and forconsideration of any legally viable alternative.Cereals39. As part of the price fixing settlement, the Council completed the finalstage of alignment of feed grain prices; from 1 August 1978 there will bea common single intervention price for common wheat, barley and maizethereby establishing more satisfactory intervention arrangements for cereals.710933 b* 2
Mediterranean agriculture40. The Council continued its examination of the problems of theMediterranean areas of the Community. In May, agreement was reached on a five-year programme of structural reform for agriculture in the poorerMediterranean regions of the Community.Pesticides41. In June, the Council adopted a directive setting common standardsfor the risk classification, packaging and labelling of the more hazardoustypes of pesticide. Member States have until 1 January 1981 to implementthese provisions.Improvement grants42. At its meeting in May, the Council agreed to make available in 1978a sum of  45 million for grants towards the cost of individual projects for theimprovement of agriculture and fisheries production.Producer groups43. In May, the Council adopted a regulation promoting the formationof agricultural producer groups in regions deficient in producer organisation.The regulation will apply initially in Italy and (for some products) in belgium and part of France.FisheriesInternal regime44. During January the Commission produced a revised set of proposals on the internal regime covering Member States&apos; quotas for 1978, conservationmeasures, control and enforcement measures, structural measures, fishing plans and financial assistance to Ireland and Denmark for additional enforcementcosts. Amendments to structural proposals together with some minor revisionof the quota proposals were tabled in April and June. A proposal toestablish fishing plans for the herring fishery off the west coast of the irish republic and a proposal for a ban on fishing for herring west of Scotlandcombined with the other herring quotas as tabled in January, were putforward by the Commission in June.45. At an informal meeting in Berlin on 29 January, which was notattended by the United Kingdom, Ministers of the other eight Member Statesdiscussed the January package of proposals. On 30-31 January the Councilmet and failed to reach agreement on the internal regime; the other member states declared their intention to observe certain elements of the Commission^January proposals. The United Kingdom Government announced that theywould maintain in force, on a national basis, the existing conservationmeasures and undertook to observe agreed Community procedures in intro-ducing, on a national basis, any further measures. The Council had nosubsequent substantive discussion of the internal regime until the Councilon 20-21 June, which also failed to reach agreement on the internal regime.
External regime46. The Council, at its meeting on 30-31 January, authorised theCommission to continue negotiations with third countries. In February, theCommission reached agreement with the Faroe Islands, Sweden and Norwayon reciprocal fishing arrangements for 1978. These arrangements had notbeen formally approved by the Council by the end of June but the arrange-ments in them were being applied on the Community side on a provisionalbasis. Spanish fishermen were also continuing to fish under licence inMember States&apos; waters in accordance with quotas granted for short periodsat a time.Section V:  Economic, Monetary and Budgetary QuestionsEconomic and Monetary Co-operation47. The Council discussed the economic situation in the Community at its meeting on 20 February and asked the Commission to prepare a paper on a common economic strategy to respond to current economic and monetaryproblems. There was a discussion of this paper at the 20 March council which paved the way for the April European Council. The European council meeting in Copenhagen agreed that the Community should adopt a commonstrategy designed to reverse the present unsatisfactory trend in the Community&apos;economic and social situation. The strategy would concentrate on economicand monetary matters, but would also cover employment, energy, trade,industrial affairs, and relations with the developing world. Specifically, theEuropean Council endorsed the view that it was essential for economic growthto reach A\ per cent by the middle of 1979. There was further discussionof the economic and monetary aspects of the common strategy at the April,May and June Finance Councils on the basis of which a report to theEuropean Council meeting in Bremen was agreed. These discussions coverednot only the contribution which various countries might make to achievegrowth of 4  per cent but also the principles on which a new Europeancurrency arrangement might be constructed.48. The Finance Council, meeting in May, adopted a common position ona Commission proposal for a new Community loan instrument of 1,000million European units of account to assist industrial investment. Under thisscheme, money will be borrowed by the Commission and on-lent and managed by the European Investment Bank. The decision establishing this scheme will be finally adopted when the conciliation procedures with the european assembly are completed. The May meeting of the Finance Council also considered a report by the Monetary Committee on the possible doubling ofthe joint Community Borrowing facility for balance of payments&apos; assistance forMember States.49. The specialist economic and financial committees of the Communitystudied the Commission communications on improving the co-ordination ofnational economic policies and the prospect of economic and monetary union and prepared reports which were submitted to the Council. The Councilalso received reports on the first year of the five-year action programmesproposed by the Commission which are designed to make progress towardseconomic and monetary union.
50. Other Council business included a quarterly review of the economicsituation in the Community in March, when Ministers took note of commission communications on the economic policy guidelines for 1978and the degree of convergence of Member States&apos; economic policies in 1977,and, in April, prepared a common Community position for the meeting ofthe Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund in Mexico.Budgetary questionsFinancing the Budget51. It had been intended that the full own resources system should operatefrom 1 January 1978. This would have involved the replacement of theGNP-related financial contributions made by Member States by the revenueobtained from applying a Community rate of value-added tax not exceeding1 per cent to a base established in a uniform manner in accordance with the sixth VAT Directive. However, this did not prove possible because the sixth Directive was not implemented in time by the necessary minimum ofthree Member States. As a result, the residual part of the Communities, 1978Budget after payment of all established agricultural levies and customs dutieswas financed, as in previous years, by GNP-related contributions. By theend of June, the Sixth Directive had still only been implemented by twoMember States Belgium and the United Kingdom. On 26 June 1978, theCouncil therefore adopted a Ninth Directive on VAT requiring the remainingseven States to implement the Sixth Directive by 1 January 1979 at the latest.The VAT own resources system should therefore operate from that date.The 1979 Community Bodget52. In accordance with the decision of the European Council in December1975, a Joint Meeting of Foreign and Finance Ministers was held on 3 April1978. The Council discussed the development of the Community budget and general priorities for expenditure. There was general agreement on theneed to direct resources where they could be used most efficiently andconstructively, particularly in the economic and social sectors.53. The Preliminary Draft Budget for 1979 which was presented by theCommission to the Council on 15 June 1978 amounted to 13,859 millionEuropean Units of Account (EUA), equal to about  8,730 million, for paymentappropriations; this represented an increase of 1,497 million EUA (about 943 million) on the 1978 budget.Fiscal questionsHarmonisation of the structure of excise duties54. As a result of a Commission initiative aimed at speeding up progress on harmonisation of the scope and structure of excise duties, considerationresumed during this period of three directives on alcohol (includingbeverage spirits and fortified wines), beer and table wine. These proposals were originally submitted to the Council in 1972 and 1973 but until thisyear little progress had been made.
Export credits55. Since March 1977 the Community and most other Members ofthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)applied certain guidelines governing the extension of officially supportedexport credits on terms of two years or more. The guidelines, which are intended to restrict destructive competition between credit-supplying countries,were reviewed by all participants at the beginning of this year. As a result,the Council agreed on 4 April 1978 that the Community would apply theslightly modified guidelines until 31 October 1978 when they will again be reviewed. All members of the OECD except Turkey and Iceland nowobserve the guidelines.Section VI:   Regional and Industrial AffairsEmergency aid56. In January, the Commission offered assistance to the UnitedKingdom, France and Belgium, the member states worst affected by last winter&apos;s bad weather. One million European units of account (EUA),approximately  630,000, were provided for England and Wales. It was left to the United Kingdom Government to decide how the assistance shouldbe distributed. Subsequently a further 500,000 EUA (approximately 315,000) was allocated to Scotland following severe blizzards. The moneywill be used to assist farmers and local authorities in the most severely affected areas.European Investment Bank57. The European Investment Bank approved loans in the UnitedKingdom to the value of  51-55 million. The National Water Councilreceived loans of  16 million towards the financing of water supply and sewerage schemes in Yorkshire and Humberside. The Grampian RegionalCouncil were granted a loan of  5 million for road schemes and sewerageworks. A loan of  8-5 million was approved to the Lothian RegionalCouncil for the construction of a dam, acqueducts and sewerage schemes.BICC Metals Ltd received a loan of  5 million towards the financing of anew electrolytic copper refinery.58. Also included in the amount granted to the United Kingdom were two loans under the exchange risk guarantee scheme. DJB Engineering Ltd.received a loan of  2 million for the provision of additional plant and machinery to increase capacity for manufacturing heavy articulated dumptrucks and a loan of  0-05 million was granted to Morgan Marine Ltd forthe expansion of manufacturing capacity of glass fibre kiosks and marineinstallations.European Coal and Steel Community59. Loans totalling  5 million were approved for the United Kingdom&apos;ssteel industry and loans to the value of  95 - 2 million were approved for thecoal industry.
European Regional Development Fund60. The Council reached agreement on the Regional Development fund for 1978-80. The United Kingdom quota will be 27-03 per cent and 5 percent of the Fund will be allocated by the Commission outside the quota.The value of the Fund in 1978 will be 581 million EUA ( 366 million).1Steel61. The United Kingdom steel industry benefited from the measures taken by the Commission to counter the effects of the world steel recessionon the Community steel market. These include mandatory minimum prices for some steel products and guidance on prices and deliveries within theCommon market as well as agreements with major supplying countriescovering the prices and volume of their sales to the Community. But theweak state of demand continued to put pressure on steel prices; theGovernment supported the Commissions efforts to ensure the effectiveness of its measures.62. The Commission began a revision of its longer-term forecasts ofsteel demand and supply preparatory to the formulation of plans forrestructuring the Community steel industry. Both the restructuring plans and any related measures will have to be further developed by theCommission in consultation with the Member States.Shipbuilding63. The fourth directive on aids to shipbuilding was adopted by theCouncil of Ministers on 4 April 1978. This directive provides that aids toshipbuilding shall be permitted provided that they are granted in order to alleviate serious crises in the industry or in response to acute social problems.Such aids are to be accompanied by measures aimed at making the industrymore competitive and capable of operating without aid; controls are provided to ensure that the aids granted do not distort intra-Community competition.The United Kingdom Shipbuilding Intervention Fund was regarded ascompatible with the terms of this directive and negotiations took place withthe Commission regarding the continuation of this scheme after 30 June 1978.64. The communication on re-organisation of the Community ship-building industry which was submitted to the Council in December wasconsidered further. Whilst there was general agreement on the Commission^analysis of the present state of shipbuilding in the world as a whole, therewere fundamental disagreements between Member States about the form any future Community shipbuilding policy might take. In the meantime,Member States continued to co-operate closely and to pursue their commonapproach to the shipbuilding crisis in line with policy guidelines agreed inthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Aircraft construction industry65. In June the Commission submitted a communication to theCouncil of Ministers in pursuance of the resolution of March 1975 and theCouncil statement of March 1977 relating to concerted action on aircraftprogrammes. The communication reviewed the current state of develop-ment of the main European aircraft projects in the growing European
market and the role which the Community might play in supporting further development. This role, it was suggested, should include promotingdiscussions between manufacturers and airlines, and examining the possibilityof wider financial participation. Looking further ahead, the Commissionsuggested Community action to create a larger internal market for civil aircraft, the possible provision of e.c. financing for new aircraft projects and back-up measures in the fields of trade and technology. discussions on a further Communication entitled 44 Action Programme for aeronautical research &quot; also took place but no final decisions were reached on these documents.-Company law harmonisation66. A Companies Bill is being prepared, for introduction as theopportunity permits, which will implement the second directive on theformation and capital of public companies. Further legislation will berequired by mid-1980 to implement the fourth directive on companyaccounts which was adopted at the Council of Ministers meeting on 27 June1978. Work continued on draft directives on internal mergers, prospectuses,collective investment undertakings for transferable securities (unit trusts), the admission of securities to official stock exchange quotation and on theEuropean Companies Statute. A draft directive on the qualification ofauditors and a revised draft of the Regulation on the European Co-operationGrouping were published in April. Consideration also continued of proposalsfor draft directives on the canvassing of transferable securities, the dis-closure of information for listed companies and the dissolution or liquidation of limited companies, and for a Convention on International Mergers, thedraft Bankruptcy Convention and the freedom of establishment for stock-brokers and jobbers.Insurance67. A report on the progress of negotiations was considered by theCouncil in April 1978. The Community co-insurance directive was adopted on 30 May 1978. The draft directive on life assurance on an establishmentbasis neared final adoption, but progress on the draft directive concerningthe sale of non-life insurance across frontiers was slow.Industrial property68. Work continued on the steps necessary to implement the CommunityPatent Convention. Consideration was given to the possible creation of a community Trade Mark; the Government reaffirmed their desire to see theCommunity Trade Mark Office situated in London.Section VII: Environment and transportEnvironment69. The Council of Environment Ministers met on 30 May 1978 and agreed to directives on the lead content of petrol (reduction of maximum permissible lead content to 0-4 grammes per litre by 1 January 1981) and on
water quality requirements for freshwater fish. They also adopted aresolution on fluoro-carbons, which called for a co-ordination of nationalresearch on the subject pending reconsideration during the second half of1978 of the line the Community should adopt. The Council agreed to theopening of discussions with the United States on the implications of theUnited States Toxic Substances Control Act. Discussion was resumed onthe proposed directive on bird conservation, but the Council was unable toreach agreement on it.Transport70. The Council of Ministers met on 12 June. They approved in principlea directive on the adjustment of national taxation systems for commercialroad vehicles; approved the terms of a statement on the introduction asfrom 1 July 1978 of a tax on road goods transport going to or throughAustria; adopted a proposal for a regulation laying down uniform costingprinciples for the international transport of goods carried by rail in fulltrain loans; noted a Commission report on progress achieved in thepreparation of a programme of co-operation among railways in the Com-munity and authorised the preparation of further measures by the Commission;took note of the Commission^ intention to carry out a three-year experiment in monitoring traffic between the freight markets of Member States; and agreed that the directive on combined road/rail transport at present in force for an experimental period should be made permanent.71. The Commission issued a reasoned opinion on 15 February callingon the United Kingdom to comply with e.c. regulation 1463/70 ontachographs within two months. After considering the Governments reply,which explained their difficulties in this matter, the Commission made anapplication on 7 June to the Court of Justice of the European Communities.72. On 10 March the Commission gave notice that in their view the UnitedKingdom scheme for type approval of motor cars involved arrangementsfor imported vehicles which amounted to a quantitative restriction on themand that the fees charged for certification of such vehicles were in thenature of an import duty. In a reply sent on 11 May, the United Kingdomresisted this view.Shipping, maritime safety and pollution73. In the wake of the Amoco Cadiz disaster in April, the Communitydiscussed a number of measures concerning maritime safety and pollution.The Environment Council on 30 May endorsed a Community action pro-gramme on oil pollution, consisting of proposals on the role which can usefully be played by the Community in this area; and the June transport council agreed to recommend Member States to ratify relevant international conventions within a specified timescale. The Transport Council alsoadopted a decision enabling the Community to monitor the activities offleets of countries whose practices threaten Community shipping. There isalso provision for the possible subsequent use of concerted countermeasures.
Civil Aviation74. The Transport Council agreed a priority list of civil aviation topicsfor further detailed study. They also agreed that it would be useful toestablish links between the Community and the European Civil AviationConference and the International Civil Aviation Organisation.Section VIII: Social AffairsUnemployment75. Unemployment remained a major preoccupation in the Community.Two meetings of the Standing Committee on Employment representingmanagements, unions and Labour and Social Affairs Ministers, were held andtwo of the studies in the joint work programme agreed by last year&apos;sTripartite Conference were discussed : work-sharing and the creation of jobsm the tertiary sector (including the public sector). The other two mainstudies in the programme, on the relationship between investment andemployment and on international factors affecting growth and employment,were examined by the Economic Policy Committee in conjunction with thesocial partners.76. In December 1977 the Commission formally expressed its concern thatthe United Kingdom Temporary Employment Subsidy in the form in whichit then existed was incompatible with the competition rules of the Treaty of rome. They did not oppose the principle of the Temporary EmploymentSubsidy but objected to a number of its features, in particular its concentra-tion in the textile, clothing and footwear sectors. After intensive discussions with the Commission, agreement was reached on limited modifications tothis subsidy to make it compatible with the Treaty and to allow it tocontinue for a further year. The main effect of this agreement with theCommission was to require employers to submit reorganisation plans toensure the longer-term viability of supported jobs, to set limits to theproportion of the work force that could be supported in establishments inthe textile, clothing and footwear sectors, and to require prior notification of major individual cases to the Commission. In May, the Governmentintroduced arrangements for the support of short-time working for the textile, clothing and footwear sectors to provide support for those workersthreatened by redundancy who would otherwise have been covered by theTemporary Employment Subsidy.European Social Fund77. At a meeting on 29 June Labour and Social Affairs Ministersdiscussed the Commission^ proposals for a new category of aid under theEuropean Social Fund to promote employment of young people throughsupport for recruitment subsidies and job creation programmes. Althoughthe great majority of Member States including the United Kingdom were able to accept a compromise proposed by the Danish Presidency, no final agreement could be reached at that meeting.
78. The Commission reported to the Council on 29 June that they were examining the possible use of the Social Fund for alleviating the adverseemployment effects of measures for industrial restructuring.Social Affairs79. At the Council meeting on 29 June, Labour and Social AffairsMinisters agreed a directive designed to protect the health of workers exposed to vinyl chloride monomer. They also agreed a resolution on an actionprogramme on safety and health at work which calls for a number of measures in this area to be taken within the four-year period to the end of1982. These measures will aim to improve the working situation, knowledgeabout the assessment and control of risks, and human attitudes to occupationalhealth and safety.80. An agreement was signed on 7 June by the Commission and theEuropean Trade Union Confederation regarding the setting-up with Com-munity support of the European Trade Union Institute, which is expected to open formally later in the year.Illegal migration and illegal employment81. The Commission produced a revised version of its draft directive onillegal migration and illegal employment. This aims to harmonise the laws of Member States so as to reduce the illegal employment of third-countrynationals and to safeguard certain rights of employees in this situation.Social security82. On 31 December 1977 the Commission presented their proposals forthe adaptation of the Council regulation on the application of social securityschemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community,to extend it to self-employed persons and their families. Discussion of thesecomplex proposals continued throughout the period under review.Section IX: Education83. The selection of projects for inclusion in the Community programme on the transition from school to work was completed in March. There willbe five projects in the United Kingdom. Each of the pilot projects dealswith a particular aspect of the transition from school to work. In inner london, eight schools and five further education colleges will take part ina project involving a two-year bridging course for pupils who are thought tobe under-achieving. A bridging course will also be developed in Strathclyde,Scotland, for young people who leave school at 16; special attention will bepaid to the provision of counselling and careers guidance, and to the links between education and industry. In Sheffield, three comprehensive schools will be trying out ways of improving the provision made for low-achievingpupils in the last two years of school, in close co-operation with further education colleges, the Careers Service and other services. In Bradford, a one-year programme will be developed to meet the special needs of west indian and Asian young people who are unemployed on leaving school.
A project to be run by the National Institute for Careers Education andCounselling will develop methods of on-site in-service training in careerseducation in schools and further education colleges in Bedfordshire, Haringeyand Knowsley. Finally, a project in Mid-Glamorgan, Wales, providing abridge between school and work for handicapped young people will be associated with the Community programme of pilot projects.84. A Handbook for Students was published by the Commission to provideuseful information for students wishing to take a higher education course in another Member State. The Commission also issued information on schemesof grants for 1978/79 to finance short study visits by higher education teachers and administrators, local and regional administrators, and specialists invocational education and guidance; and to promote the development of jointstudy programmes.European Foundation85. The European Council on 7/8 April agreed to the establishment ofthe European Foundation to promote cultural and social contacts in theCommunity, as foreshadowed in the Tindemans Report. The EuropeanFoundation is to be situated in Paris. Detailed work on the legal base,structure and functions of the Foundation continued in the light of theEuropean Council decision.Section X: Research86. Following earlier Council decisions on the siting and organisationalstructure for the Joint European Torus (JET) project under the Communitythermonuclear fusion programme, the Council formally set up the necessaryjoint undertaking and decided that it should be given certain privileges and immunities.  Orders in Council to this effect were laid before Parliament.87. The Council adopted programmes of research covering aspects of primary raw materials, uranium prospecting and extraction and the recyclingof paper and cardboard, as well as concerted actions (i.e. projects consistingin the exchange of information about national programmes) relating to thegrowth of large conurbations, the effects of processing on the physicalproperties of foodstuffs and, in the field of medical and public health research,the registration of congenital abnormalities, cellular ageing and the artificialoxygenation of blood.Section XI: Energy88.

The Councilalso had a general discussion on nuclear questions and considered a statementof Community energy policy objectives for 1985.
89. The Council agreed on the regulation on demonstration projects inenergy saving and on the framework regulation on demonstration projects inalternative energies. These regulations will not, however, come into force until the Council adopts regulations setting financial limits for the aid to begiven under each scheme, and the first group of projects under each scheme is approved. No agreement was reached on the other items.Section XII: Institutional AffairsDirect elections90. The European Council meeting in Copenhagen on 7-8 April decidedthat direct elections to the European Assembly would be held on 7-10 June1979.
