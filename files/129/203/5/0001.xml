DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY-S GOVERNMENT.. 80COPY no cp(78) 8013 July 1978CABINETBRITAIN, GERMANY AND THE PROPOSED EUROPEANMONETARY system memorandum by the Secretary of State for Energy1. The Franco-German determination to go ahead with a EuropeanMonetary System (EMS) whether or not Britain agrees, threatens to split theEuropean Community.    This initiative places us in a difficult situation. Ifwe accept the proposals we shall become locked into a form of union whichmay ruin our long-term economic future and destroy our remaining political independence.    If we refuse, we may be blamed for wrecking the community and perpetuating a highly unstable situation which damages all countries.2- Since we cannot in the end accept a union which would be disastrousfor us, the time must be coming for a British &quot;non&quot; of Gaullist clarity andresonance. We have the indisputable right to veto a major development ofthe Community which is strongly contrary to our interests.3.        If the &quot;Non&quot; is to be effective it must be accompanied by a clearanalysis and counter-proposals.    An agenda of demands for minor reformis not enough because it leaves us wide open to compromise concessions which would force us to concede the main issue.4- The British position, at present, appears to be that we could accept an EMS if it were accompanied by a system of redistributive transferswithin the Community.    Transfers might seem to be to our short-termadvantage in so far as they would temporarily improve our balance ofPayments and raise our disposable income.    But in the long term transfersare even more dangerous than an EMS because they could easily become a substitute for any attack on the fundamental problem of unequal productivecapacity and competitiveness.    They would make us permanently and directlydependent on the financial charity of Germany as the richest member of theCommunity.    The Germans might be willing to subsidise social provision in Britain.    But the last thing they want is to subsidise less competitiveBritish industries to compete against their own industries.    They would be bound to use their contribution to Community transfers as a lever to enforce
competition policy and hence, within an EMS, to enforce continueddeindustrialisation of the United Kingdom.    All this means that byproposing major redistributive transfers within the Community we arebuilding a trap for ourselves, which is just as dangerous as the EMS andwhich, in combination with EMS, could lead the United Kingdom to ruinwithin one or two decades.5. The British &quot;Non&quot; has to be based on an insistence that thefundamental problem is unequal competition.    It is this which gives riseto worsening unemployment and exacerbates exchange rate and inflationtrends which damage us all.    Speculation makes exchange rates harder to manage but it is a symptom, not a cause, of the Community1 s real disease.Linking currencies firmly to the European Currency Unit might suppressthe exchange rate symptom but it will make the disease itself worse.6. Britain&apos;s counter-proposal must be for a direct attack on theproblem of unequal competition.    We must seek an agreement on concerted action and thereafter to go it alone if our demand is not met.    The basis of britain&apos;s proposals should be a partial suspension of the competition andtrade policy of the Community.    No-subsidy, free trade rules should been forced more strictly on the stronger countries and regions while weakcountries and regions should be encouraged to give discriminatory aidsand protection to their industries.    We might propose a European industrial conference to co-ordinate the industrial and trade planning of member countries.7. So far as financial instability is concerned, the main need is forregulation of capital movements.    This could be done on a co-ordinatedbasis by the Central Banks (as was envisaged in the early american proposals for the International Monetary Fund).    It would have to involvethe Americans as well as Europeans in order to bring offshore bankingunder control.    But there is no reason why the Europeans should not actjointly to take the lead in negotiations.8* We need to develop the United Kingdom&apos;s bargaining position alongthese lines very urgently.    I propose that a Ministerial group should be setUP to do this immediately and to report back within a few weeks.    We musthave a defensible and agreed position by the beginning of September to carryus through domestic and international events of the autumn.A W Bdepartment of Energy!3 July 19782
