CP(78) 99 COPY NO10 October 1978CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE, 1979-80 TO 1982-83Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. On 6 July (CM(78) 25th Conclusions, Minute 4), Cabinet decided that public expenditure should be limited to the total announced in last January1 white Paper for 1979-80 and 1980-81, and an annual growth rate of 2 per centin each of the following two years.    Within this limit, I was to discuss withthe spending Ministers their additional bids and scope for offsetting savings,and in particular to re-examine the cost and treatment of the proposed short time working scheme.2. In the light of the discussions which I have since had I now inviteCabinet to take decisions on the individual programmes, for publication inthe White Paper:  firm decisions for 1979-80, as the basis, among other things, for the Parliamentary Estimates and for next month&apos;s rate support grant negotiations; more provisional decisions on the plans for later years.HEADROOM AND BIDS3. The essential figures are in Table 1.    Line 1 is the initial headroomshown in my July paper.    The figures in line 2 provide for various revisions,some favourable, some unfavourable, in the demand-responsive services or those affected by price movements;  Table 2 gives details.    Line 3 shows the headroom now available for allocation to programmes or to the contingency Reserve.4. Departments&apos; original proposals for additional expenditurs as recorded in the survey report are summarised in Table 4.    There is room for only afew of these proposals, those of the highest priority.    I suggest theallocation listed in section 4 of Table 1.    The Appendix gives notes on the implications for each Minister&apos;s programmes.SHORTFALL5. In the course of my bilateral discussions I asked colleagues againwhether they could reduce any of their programme figures. Someprogrammes have been underspent in the last two years, and total underspending1
has been higher than we have been accustomed to expect.    Certain ministers have indicated that they can make offsetting savings on this account to absorbat least some part of their priority bids.    But colleagues have not been ableto suggest sufficient reductions in their programmes to accommodate majorincreases elsewhere.1979-80 AND 1980-816. The problem is most acute in 1979-80 and 1980-81.    In allocating thevery limited headroom available, the Cabinet agreed in July to give priority to the short-time working scheme.    I have re-examined this scheme inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Employment, and my proposals is to allow  200 million for this or alternative schemes in 1979-80, 425 million in 1980-81 and  460 million in subsequent years.    The Secretaryof State for Employment has not felt able to reduce his earlier estimate of 230 million in 1979-80 and  460 million in each of the later years, but inview of the uncertain timing of the legislation and the delays which oftenoccur in getting these schemes going, I propose that we plan for the loweramounts I suggest in the next two years, recognising that if additionalamounts turn out to be needed, they will have to be provided if offsetting savings are not available.7. This eases the problem in 1979-80 and 1980-81 a little, but it can onlybe solved by using the scope provided by the larger programmes forabsorbing additional requirements.    I suggest that some rearrangement oftheir programmes should enable the Departments of Industry, Transport,and Education and Science to manage within their existing provisions forthese years.    In addition, I suggest a net saving of  50 million in theDepartment of the Environment programme next year and a small net saving on defence which would still be consistent with the North Atlantic treaty organisation 3 per cent growth target for these two years.8. There is a particular issue for decision on the education programme which is what increase in the school meal charge should be planned for theautumn of 1979.    This decision is needed for the rate support grant negotiations as well as for the White Paper.    The bid in the survey report was to cover under-provision of  103 million in 1979-80, which was based onan assumed increase in the charge of 3p next autumn, from 25p to 28p. TheDepartment of Education and Science have identified over-provision in otherparts of the Education programme, and I propose that this should be utilisedto cover the extra requirement for school meals and some small increaseselsewhere in the programme.    The problem could however be diminished tosome extent if the charge were raised by more than 3p:  for example anincrease of 5p would reduce the under-provision in 1979-80 to  90 millionwhile an increase of lOp would reduce it to  73 million.9. If my proposals on these large programmes are agreed, there will be room for some modest extra provision in areas which my discussions suggestare of the highest priority.    Some increases are needed for health, and for 
law and order, to help maintain standards.    We can also accommodatesome relatively small proposals for extending eligibility for mobilityallowance, family income supplement and industrial injuries compensation,and some limited increases on energy and consumer protection.1981-82 AND 1982-8310. In these later years there is more headroom, but still far less thanthe additional bids.    My proposals envisage significant increases in a numberof programmes.    There is no need to settle now the allocation of theremaining headroom:  this is better left for decision nearer the time, in thelight of the priorities which emerge.CONTINGENCY RESERVE11. I propose Contingency Reserves over the four years of  900 million, 1, 500 million,  2,100 million and  2, 500 million.    In all but the second year, this represents a slight increase on the proposals made in July . Mybilateral discussions have identified a number of probable requirements for additional expenditure for which there is no provision in the programmefigures now proposed but which, if they come about, in the absence ofoffsetting savings will have to be met from the Contingency Reserve. Wemust have enough in the Reserve to cover these items, as well as otheradditions to expenditure on which we may want to decide later.PRIORITIES12. As I have indicated, the figures do not permit us to provide for manyof the additional proposals put forward by the Ministers concerned. Manyof these are in themselves highly desirable.    I am troubled by the difficultyof finding reductions in expenditure of lesser priority to make room for them.I believe that in the longer term we should consider a more radicalreappraisal of priorities with this in view, but it has not been possible to achieve it this year.CONCLUSIONS13. I invite the Cabinet -i. to approve the allocations proposed in Table 1 for 1979-80and 1980-81, and ii. to agree the allocations provisionally proposed in Table for 1981-82 and 1982-83, leaving the remaining headroom to be allocated nearer the time.3
14.        In the light of these decisions, I will arrange for the public expenditure white Paper to be drafted and brought to Cabinet for consideration in due course.j treasury Chambers10 October 19784

APPENDIXPROPOSALS ON INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMES(  million at 1978 survey prices throughout)This ajpendix summarises the broad effects of the proposed net changesin programmes set out in section 4 of Table 1.   All these changes are measured relative to the baseline figures in the survey report.2. Ministry of Defence.     The proposals in Table 1 provide for small reductions in the figures for the defence budget in 1979-80and 1980-81 and no change in the two succeeding years. Withthese adjustments, the defence budget would grow by exactly 3 percent in 1979-80 and 1980-81, as already intimated to NATO, andwould remain virtually flat thereafter.     The Secretary of state has proposed an extra 217 of defence spending in 1981-82 so thatwe can continue to adhere to the NATO guideline of 3 per centannual growth in defence expenditure.   He has also proposed on a provisional basis a similar increase in 1982-83.    The figures inTable 1 do not include these items.3. Foreign and Commonwealth Office.    The Department haveagreed to   make reductions in provision for the diplomaticestate so as to offset the extra expenditure on the UK&apos;s contri-bution to the UN Middle East peace-keeping forces and yield smallnet savings in 1979-80 and 1980-81.   The Department may incurextra expenditure on the UN Force in Namibia and the BritishIndian Ocean Territory; but the amounts and timing are uncertain.4. Ministry of Overseas Development.   The proposals envisageannual growth of 6 per cent in the aid programme over the next three years, followed by a provisional 8 per cent in 1982-83.This would mean that the aid   programme would grow much faster than any other   programme, and more than three times as fast as public expenditure as a whole, over the survey period.
5. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food/Correspondingdepartments in Scotland and Wales/IBAP.    The figures in Table 2exclude agricultural support related to e.c. contributions butinclude Northern Ireland.    There are increased estimates for the thames Tidal Barrier and two or three other minor items whichare virtually unavoidable.    The proposals also allow for a small amount of extra expenditure on food research in the two finalyears.   If a case is established for extra expenditure on thefood stockpile, this would have to be a claim on the contingency reserve.    The extra requirement in 1979-80 for support for potatoesis included in the figures at Table 2.6. Forestry Commission.    The small extra amounts shown arerequired to enable the Forestry Commission to carry out the government&apos;s declared policy for planting 22,000 hectares a year.7. Department of Trade.    The Table 1 proposals envisage asmall amount of extra expenditure on tourism and on certain civilaviation projects, including the Birmingham air terminal. further provision for investment in this part of the programme should beleft for consideration in the next survey.    The figures allow for expected savings in certain areas of the Departments programme,including shipping and aviation services and the Patent Office.8. Department of Prices and Consumer Protection.    The Table 1 propo-sals include provision for continued support for Citizens1 AdviceBureaux and to maintain the level of assistance to ConsumerAdvice Centres, pending a wider review   of advice services. some additional provision is also required in connection with legislation already agreed.9. Department of Industry.    The proposals envisage provisionof an extra 22 in 1981-82 to cover developments in the industrialstrategy, including support for micro-electronic applications.It is not yet clear whether the requirements of British Leylandand Rolls Royce will be capable of being met within the Nationalfiaterprise Board&apos;s existing allocation for 1979-80.   To the extent that the requirements cannot be met by rephasing of expenditure and increased private sector financing, there may have to &quot;be a claim on the contingency reserve.
confidential10. Department of Rnployment.   The extra provision included inTable 1 relates to the proposed short time working scheme, oralternative schemes in 1979-80 (see main paper, paragraph 6).Provision will also be needed next year to continue the jobrelease scheme and the small firms employment subsidy beyondMarch: this will be a claim on the contingency reserve.11. The social security programme proposals provide for introducing fortnightly payment of unemployment benefit nextyear.   This will cause an extra week of benefit payments during1979-80 at an estimated cost of  13 million.    It is proposedthat the Secretary of State for Employment should find room for this by reducing the figures for programmes other than the short time working scheme by a comparable amount, bearing inmind the record of heavy shortfall on these programmes.12. Department of Energy.    Extra provision is required for NationalSmokeless Fuels   and residual expenditure from this year&apos;s winterfuel scheme.    Further provision may be needed for the coalindustry; but it would be premature to provide for this before we have the results of the energy review now in progress. Anyextra requirements for coal or the nuclear programme would haveto be met from the contingency reserve.13. Department of Transport.    The proposals assume no change inthe existing provision for roads and transport.    This means thatrequirements for increased expenditure in areas such as portsinvestment and any extra requirements for the Port of london authority will have to be financed from savings elsewhere in theprogramme.14. Department of the Environment.   The proposals at Table 2envisage that the Department&apos;s total allocation should be increasedby two-thirds of the additional cost of housing subsidies arisingfrom higher interest rates.15. The proposals at Table 1 envisage that the Secretary ofState should make reductions elsewhere in his programme to offset the remaining one-third of the increase on housing subsidies and
the extra expenditure on local environmental services whichit seems certain local authorities will incur, as well as off-setting some other increases which he has already undertaken to accommodate within his total allocation.   Since the standardof housing provision in this country is now high relative toother social services, and the actual level of new housebuildingapprovals for both Labour and Conservative councils has fallenwell below planned levels in 1977$ aiid again in 1978, theSecretary of State might be asked to accept a net reduction of50 over his programmes as a whole in 1979-80, followed by nochange in 1980-81.   At the same time,     the proposals envisagethat we should find room for some increase in the department sprogrammes in the two final years of the survey period.16. Consideration is being given to the problem of how to handleadditional expenditure on the option mortgage subsidy which may result from the introduction of a reduced rate band of incometax and the consequent switching from tax relief to optionmortgages.    We shall need to consider this problem in relationto the draft White Paper.17. Home Office.       Increased   provision for law and order is included to cover essential capital and current items (notablyfor prisons).    This is not however large enough to meet all theHome Secretary^ proposals for improvements, particularly forcourts and police capital items.   No provision is included atthis stage for the implications of the Edmund-Davies award for police manpower and equipment: the amounts are uncertain and willbe a claim on the contingency reserve.18. Nothing is included for the fourth television channel; butthe timing of the legislation is uncertain, and here againprovision will be needed in future surveys or from the contingency reserve.   No provision is included for additional expenditure ongrants to local authorities with a high concentration of ethnicminorities.   HS Committee have agreed in principle to the proposalbut without commitment to the additional expenditure thought necessary.   If this is to go ahead it will need to be financed from savings   within other programmes.
19. Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department.    The savings in the early years result from the withdrawal of legal aid from undefendeddivorce cases.    But the Lord Chancellor considers himself committed to make improvements in legal aid, and the suggested net increases in the programme in later years reflect this.20. Department of Education and Science.    The proposal is that,assuming that the school meal charge is raised by 3p i^ autumn1979 and in line with inflation thereafter, the resulting under-provision of about  100 million a year should be covered bysavings elsewhere in the Education programme (see paragraph 8of main paper).   In addition there is a strong case for some small increases elsewhere in the Secretary of State&apos;s programmes and for giving priority to extra expenditure in support of micro-electronics, as recommended by the Industrial Strategy team. Butthe savings on other parts of the programme are likely to go beyond the amount required to make good the provision for school meals, especially in the later years, and they could be used to offset other increases.   It is unlikely however that there willbe room to accommodate the proposed scheme for mandatory awardsfor 16-18 year olds in full-time education.21. DHSS ; Health and personal social services.    The proposalsinclude provision for consequentials of the increased expenditureon the National Health Service announced in the last Budget. Forthe later years, it is proposed that we should plan for expenditure to grow at 2 per cent a year.
