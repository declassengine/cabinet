There have also been some other drafting changes:-Paragraph 29 - delete from &quot;The Policy we adopt ...&quot; to &quot;... theMiddle East&quot;.Paragraph 33 - delete the first sentence.Paragraph 34 - delete the last sentence.Paragraph 39 - the first sentence should now read:   &quot;Clearly many members of the Home Civil and Diplomatic Services have, and shouldhave, a great deal in common with each other, but this . . . &quot;.Paragraph 52 - add at the end of the paragraph the following sentence:&quot;The Government will do all it can to encourage recruitment from a wider base which corresponds to our national system of education&quot;.Paragraph 54 - line 4, delete the words &quot;or seeming to become&quot;.Paragraph 55 - delete all after second sentence.Paragraph 57 - line 4, delete &quot;frequently&quot; and insert &quot;if need be&quot;.
Paragraph 79 - add at the end of the paragraph the following sentence:&quot;In particular it is important to sustain and, where possible, toextend the work which is done in spreading the knowledge of theEnglish language and in promoting its cultural, commercial and diplomatic use&quot;.3- There have also been minor changes to the last sentence ofParagraph 72 and the first sentence of paragraph 81, which deal with theCentral Office of Information and the British Council.    These changes havebeen cleared with the appropriate Ministries.4- The Prime Minister has now agreed that the White Paper should bepublished before the House rises.    It would therefore be desirable to have thefinal views of colleagues this week.    Subject to the Prime Minister^ final approval, it may not be necessary in view of the extensive Ministerialconsultation that has already taken place to spend time on the White Paper at cabinet itself.    I hope that colleagues can agree it in correspondence. Ishall therefore assume that I have the agreement of colleagues if I hearnothing to the contrary by 5. 00 pm on Wednesday 26 July.D A L O* oreigu and Commonwealth Office25 July 19782
DRAFT WHITE PAPERBRITISH INTERESTS AND OBJECTIVES OVERSEAS1. The geographical and economic facts of life make it inevitable that today, as in previous centuries, Britishinterests should extend round the world.   The government believe that Britain has the assets to defend her interestsand effectively to promote her objectives.     These assetsinclude our economic and military strength as a nation; ourhistorical ties with many members of the internationalcommunity; the binding force of the English language; ourunquestioned standing in the arts and science and our contribution to the world1s cultural heritage; the example of British values and our country1s democratic way of life;but above all the influence which we derive from cooperativeand co-ordinate action with our partners in democracy.2. Politically, too, the position which we occupy in thePrincipal areas of international affairs gives us a more thanadequate springboard for an imaginative and effective foreignPolicy, and our resources can support the system of overseas representation which such a foreign policy entails.   By the1980s we shall be the only member of the European community to be self-sufficent in the increasingly scarce and expensivecommodity of energy.   The challenge is to use effectively,efficiently and economically the benefits of North Sea oil sothat we can re-invest in our industrial base and so help remedy the deep-seated structural problems of British industry.3*     Britain&apos;s objectives overseas are:(a) to safeguard the security of our country;(b) to promote its prosperity;(c) to uphold and extend the basic values and freedomsof our democracy;(d) to honour our commitments and obligations;/(e)
(e) to work for a peaceful and just world;(f) to contribute to the achievement of the aboveobjectives by providing assistance to developing countries.*.   Economic matters are inextricably part of British foreignPolicy.   We import half our food and more than half of our rawAerials.   The exports which go to pay for these constitutebetween one-quarter and one-third of our Gross National Product.Britain&apos;s needs and interests as a trading nation will, for the foreseeable future, inevitably continue to be a decisiveinfluence on our foreign policy.5.    The importance of economic and commercial activity must bestressed: our overseas representation has to be geared to. the promotion of Britain&apos;s economic interests and export opportunities,^t this does not mean that export promotion should be a pre-eminent requirement of overseas representation in all countries ofthe WOrld; the safeguarding of our prosperity also depends onthe effectiveness of our contribution to solving the problemsof world economic management in ways which promote our mterests.^e parallel importance of our security and political interests,both in their own right and as an influence on our economicfortunes, must also be taken into account.   We shall not beProsperous unless we are secure.     In Southern Africaor the Middle East for example Political and economic issuesa*e inextricably connected.   The standing of this country m^e eyes of the world is bound up with our stand on human rights0^ how far we can make our values, political, social and cultural,^oerstood.   Our assessment of our interest cannot therefore be confined either generally, or in any one country, to economic orexPort considerations alone.6-    The relevance of our objectives will vary from country toCountry and over time.   The aim is to focus our resources on those countries where our interests are greatest and where ourerforts will pay the greatest dividends.   The detailed determm-ation of British interests and policy   overseas, and the^sequent detailed mix of overseas representation, require usto look at each country individually.
V.     This said, there is a sense in which the pursuit ofeconomic objectives takes precedence over all others. our ability to safe-guard our security; to be a reliable ally in theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation; to be a constructivePartner in the European Community and the Commonwealth; to honour our international commitments and obligations; andto contribute, not laaet by our aid programme, to the building of a peaceful, ;just and prosperous world, from which we shallbenefit as much as anyone else, depends in the last resorton our economic strength.II THE FUTURE PATTERN OP BRITAIN&apos;S OVERSEAS REPRESENTATION8.     Foreign policy is about what has to be done; diplomacyabout how to do it.   Diplomacy normally has to be conducted in confidence and with discretion.   To achieve our foreign policyobjectives entails complex and delicate negotiations, frequentlycoordinated with our Allies or Community partners.   Many ofthese negotiations would stand little chance of success ifconducted in the public eye.   Yet, without greater public^formation and debate, there can be little chance of thenecessary public understanding: it is essential that the basicaias of British foreign policy should be supported and under-stood by the people of Britain.9-    This is why the Government, in support of their overallobjective of providing a more open and accessible administration,**e making a special effort to explain publicly the objectives of our foreign policy.   This is done in Parliament, through the*edia and in a multiplicity of international bodies on the mamar*as of activity - Southern Africa; disarmament and non-Proliferation; East-West relations; the North-South Dialogue;oovelopment assistance and cooperation; and the European Community,^he Government are also publishing two new series of papers:foreign Policy Documents and Background Briefs.   These are^signed to increase the flow of available public information aboutthe formulation and the conduct of our foreign policy.
10. The problem of encouraging greater public understandinghas been compounded by the growing complexity of internationalas of domestic affairs.   There is a necessarily increasingcall for specialised expertise: at home for instance in economic and statistical skills; abroad in international tradeand finance, in European Community matters and so on. the corollary has been an ever-growing number of meetings attended by officials at national and international level. the increasing tendency to replace negotiation between individualstates with negotiation between groups of countries or in international organisations    called multilateral diplomacy -and the proliferation of international organisations themselves have led inevitably to a certain bureaucratization of the conductof foreign affairs, with important negotiations bogged down indetail or settled into unimaginative routine.11. To some extent there are general developments affecting all areas of government.   The growth of bureaucracy is not uniqueto international affairs.   The problem is inherent in contemporarysociety and present a central challenge to government, not onlyin Britain but in all other democracies.   The growth of impersonaland distant government machines is a challenge to democracyitself,   if we can make government more accessible and sensitiveto the needs of the people and their democratic representatives,We strengthen the democratic base of Western societies.   The coreof the government&apos;s approach to the whole issue of British overseas^presentation is that it must, in as far as this is humanly^Possible, reflect faithfully British society in the round - itsattitudes, style, values, interests and concerns.12The Government recognise that a number of organisationaland structural changes will be necessary if this objective is toachieved and britain&apos;s overseas representation is to beef f   , .active and relevant to our future needs as a country. InCaching the following decisions the Government haue carefully considered the detailed analysis and recommendations provided by report of the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS); and theePorts of the Select Committee on Overseas Development, the/General
General Sub-Committee of the Expenditure Committee of theHouse of Commons,and its Defence and External Affdirs Sub-Committee,(DEASC).   The Governments detailed responses to the recommend-ations set out in the reports of the CERS and the DEASC are summarised in tabular form in the Annex.
13. The Government have identified five major and overlapping areasin which reforms will be introduced and new guidelines laid down.The aim is:(i)   to increase specialised knowledge in our overseas representation;(ii)   to build a closer working relationship between the diplomatic Service and the Home Civil Service;(iii)   to improve the coordination of our overseas representation, and of the resources devoted toit, both in Whitehall and abroad;(iv)   to have a Diplomatic Service fully responsive togovernment and British society;(v)   to maintain a wide but cost-effective system of residential representation overseas.Where changes in current practice are envisaged, there will beconsultation as appropriate with the Staff Sides concerned, andtheir views will be taken into account.Interchange and Expertise14. The great extension of government activity since the War in western Europe means that inter-governmental relations and european community business now cover subjects that were previously handled by private enterprise or not at all.     The conduct of external affairsrequires the constant reconciliation of domestic, Community and wideroverseas interests.     As the spread of traditionally domestic issueshas been increasingly drawn into international negotiations, so moreand more members of the Home Civil Service have been drawn intodiplomatic activity and more and more Diplomatic Service Officersinto home affairs.     A survey of overseas visits made by staff fromthe Departments of Trade, Industry and Prices and Consumer Protectionduring 1975 showed a total of 3*528 visits abroad, of which 186involved Ministers or Permanent or Deputy Secretaries.     Roughly halfof all the senior staff at the Office of the United kingdom permanent Representative to the European Communities, includingthe Deputy Permanent Representative, is drawn from Home Departments,who provide 62% of the Counsellors and 61% of the First Secretaries.15. Clearly many members of the Home Civil and Diplomatic services have, and should have, a great deal in common with each other, but/ this15
this does not mean that they should he merged into a single service,which would tend to isolate both the management and the ^xcySection of staff engaged on the external work of Home Departmentsfrom the domestic aspects of the same work.   The Government: haveVoided to make no change in the present balance of ^ste^and Departmental responsibilities, but to respond to the growingintegration of domestic and external policies by increasingsubstantially the interchange between the Home Civil Servxce and^ Diplomatic Service.   They are determined that staff workingoverseas should have a better understanding of the concerns and priorities of the Home Departments;   and that the diplomatic service as a whole should strengthen further its knowledge of^d expertise in the specialised commercial and economic functions*hich are a normal part of the responsibilities of overSe*SPresentation.   A wide process of interchange will be estabUshedbetween the Departments of Government.   This will be supplementedhy short-term attachments and the joint training of Home CivilServants and Diplomatic Service Officers.   It would be desirableif the process of interchange could be extended to industry,co*merce, banking and the trade unions.   The Government willeonsider ways in which this might be achieved.Of the options put forward by the CPRS, that involving^egration between the Diplomatic Service and the Home CivilService and the creation of a Foreign Service Group was, a&quot;er^eful consideration, rejected by the Government     They f It thatthe CPRS&apos; third alternative - interchange - had, if effectivelyaPPUed, the overriding merit of preserving the flexibility of a-U, efficiently-run and-professional Diplomatic Seme vteall the benefits that this entails in terms of firmCo*trol and tightly monitored expenditure.   It was also felt thatla*6uage specialisation and the other skills acquired within theSomatic Service could easily suffer from integration    A further^deration was the consequential disruption and morale problem.VIII.*h could stem from a controversial administrative change.The Home Civil Service should benefit from interchange as much88 ^e Diplomatic Service.   Many Home Departments need greater63*erience either of dealing with foreigners on their own ground,0t of various aspects of external relations in which the loreign^ C0mmonwealth Office has a highly developed expertise.   There isCONFIDENTIAL /-/no
no intrinsic reason why members of the Home Civil Service shouldnot become Ambassadors and senior members of the diplomatic service occupy equivalent positions in Home Departments.\%.     These considerations apply with particular force to exportpromotion. . Until 1965 the then Board of Trade provided staff forthe Trade Commissioner Service, which was responsible for exportpromotion in Commonwealth countries.    Since 1965 there has been a unified export pron^t^o^^servic^ganned by staff from the diplomatic service, working closely the Department of Trade,other Government Departments, and semi-official and private bodies concerned with the export trade.    The BOTB and other businessmenare agreed that the unified export promotion service has led to a major improvement in the standard of service at posts overseas, andthe Government haYt decided against any organisational change inthis area.    However, with the passing of time fewer people dealingwith export services in London have direct experience of conditionsoverseas.   An extended programme of interchange would do much to overcome this.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is drawing upa scheme to improve export services skills among diplomatic staff.This will entail increasing, within existing manpower and costceilings, the resources and time devoted to training, withparticular emphasis on practical work.    Greater interchange,particularly between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and theDepartment of Trade, will provide more coherence and a widerspread of the necessary expertise.1%    To meet the need for more interchange in this and other areas,the Government are setting up a programme, the aim of which is tosecure some 200 interchanges - 100 in each direction - over thenext four to five years, in addition to the /88 which already exist.    SixTu/w      Whitehall Departments will take part in this programme, with the main burden being carried by the Trade andIndustry Group and the Ministry of Overseas Development.   Most ofthem already have some experience of interchange.   Secondments willbe directly arranged between the Foreign and Commonwealth Officeand the Departments concerned.   The Civil Service Department willmonitor the programme.    The Government envisage that about two-fifths/of
of the programme will he completed by the end of its second year of operation, at which time it will he evaluated hy Ministers,Problems considered and a path mapped out for completing thesecond stage.*0   The proposals involve considerable personnel problems, someof which may require modification of existing arrangements forremuneration and allowances of home-based staff if they are to be tackled successfully.   Greater precision in career planning for^1 concerned will be. necessary.   It will be important thatinterchange should be of real value in terms of increased expertise** relevant experience abroad for members of the Home Civil Serviceaad at home for members of the Diplomatic Service, rather than beingPartaken simply to meet the targets.   A major effort will have tomade to increase the number of places available for the second-*ent of members of the Diplomatic Service into the Home Civil^rvice.   At present there are 1*0 secondments from the Home CivilService to the Diplomatic Service and only      in the other direction.^ any event the ratio must not be allowed to deteriorate further;* Possible, it should be brought more into balance.   The government also recognise that, given the comparatively small size of the diplomatic Service and the limits which this places on its capacity*o absorb secondments, a proportion of those Home Civil Servantsbonded should serve in London in the Foreign and Commonwealth0ffice.   Difficulties may well arise over the fact that service a^oad hy members of the Home Civil Service is expected in mostc*ses to he on a voluntary basis, relying on the attractiveness of^erchange within a well-planned career to produce a sufficient***er of volunteers.   Care will therefore have to be taken thatHo*e Civil Servants are appointed to a representative cross-section0f Posts abroad, without excessive concentration in those postsWhe*e the Home Departments are already well-represented.AH this can8 for a high degree of cooperation, mutualC0l*incidence and flexibility in Whitehall, and a considerable^ease in the numbers of Home Civil Servants volunteering for6ervice overseas.   The Government are, however, determined to giveth6 Programme the necessary priority for it to be successful.
Coordination at Home and AbroadAA    The responsibilities of most Government Ministers have a significant overseas dimension and each must take this overseasdimension, like any other factor, into account in formulatingPolicy.   In many fields, the Minister with the predominantfunctional interest, even though it may he primarily domestic,should and does take the lead abroad.   Experience at Councilmeetings of the European Community in Brussels shows that thisis not incompatible with a coordinated British approach across^ wide spectrum of policies.   Overall coordination of UnitedKingdom policy in the Community is provided by the Cabinet Office,^is said, the Government believe that the precondition for a^operly coordinated and integrated approach is that the overallconduct of overseas relations in the broadest sense of the termshould continue to be the responsibility of a single cabinet minister, namely the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth^fairs.   This arrangement, within the framework of the Cabinet scollective responsibility, offers the most effective means ofProviding the right level of political input and control.   It isa responsibility exercised through the direction that the SecretaryQf State gives to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and British&quot;issions overseas;   and, in relation to the European Community,through the Secretary of State-8 close working relationship with european Secretariat of the Cabinet Office.   This has developedi*to an effective mechanism for coordinating at official level all^european Community activity, and will continue.^   The responsibility of the Secretary of State for Foreign andCoamonwealth Affairs in relation to the European Community includes the development of political cooperation between the member countries.   This lies outside the Treaty of Rome and is an inter-80vernmental mechanism by which major international issues - forSample, the problems of the Middle East and Southern Africa -**e discussed and common Community positions developed.
^   Within this overall structure there is room for improvementln the coordination of policies and in the joint identificationof* and agreement on, priorities.   Country Assessment Papers,which provide the basic policy guidelines for each country where^britain is represented, will in future be prepared by the Foreign*nc* Commonwealth Office in association with all relevant GovernmentePartments.   This new system has already begun operating. Itprovide a more effective means of reaching agreement betweenappropriate Government Departments on the scale and nature ofesources to be devoted to our overseas representation in each0Untrya    jn addition, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and^Qer Departments from time to time produce joint major policyPapeT,R r .-&quot;-a on areas and issues of major importance; where possibleu* these documents will be published in the Foreign Policy^nent series.Similarly, missions abroad should reflect the concerns andfry es Qf the Government as a whole.

The Government, having carefullyvarious recommendations, believe that the present/integrated
integrated staffing of posts abroad brings benefits immeasurablygreater than those whioh might flow from separate export promotionor aid administration services.The Diplomatic Service27.     Over the last thirty years, those who have representedBritain overseas - whether in the Diplomatic Service, the home civil Service, the Armed Services, the British Council - have carried out their task during what has been one of the mosttesting periods in British his^oy.   In general the job has beendone effectively, enthusiastically and with dedication. Theforeign and Commonwealth Office and the Diplomatic Service, whobear the brunt of representing Britain overseas, have, in addition,already undergone and successfully adapted to a number of ma0orstructural and organisational changes flowing from the Duncan andBlowden Reports.   A single Diplomatic Service was created in 1965,through the amalgamation of the Foreign Service, the CommonwealthService and the Trade Commission Service; the Foreign and commonwealth Offices were brought together in a single office in1%8.   Export promotion and commercial work have become increasingly integrated into the duties of the Diplomatic Service,^is is in addition to the major operational changes which havealready taken place in the conduct of Britain-s external relations,to take account, for instance, of our membership of more than 120international bodies, not least the European Community, and the*ay in which they has modified the traditional pattern of bilateralnegotiation.28-    Recruitment to the Diplomatic Service has also changed overthe last generation.   It now comes from a-much broader base of^itish society.   In the 1950s, one in seven of new administrative^ade entrants came   from state schools; in recent years, thefi8nre has been just under one in two.   The equivalent figures fornon-Oxbridge universities are one in ten and one in three. Newderations of recruits have changed and with them attitudes arehanging too.   The Government will do all it can to encouragePruitment from a wider base which corresponds to our nationalSystem of education.
29. But there is a continuing need to adapt to changing circumstances.   Those who represent us overseas must expect tofind their activities subjected to greater publicity than in thePast and to closer scrutiny on the part of the public and parliament.   The meshing of foreign and domestic affairs is boundto generate greater public interest in external issues as it becomes increasingly clear how far the prospects for employment,Prosperity and our way of life in Britain can be affected by events and negotiations overseas.   This is increasingly the pattern, for instance, in our dealings within the european community.30. The requirement to serve abroad - which ensures that our overseas representatives have a wide and necessary knowledge ofthe many different countries with which they have to deal -carries with it the risk of their becoming distant from theattitudes of the British Government and people.   This is a^versal occupational hazard of all those who serve abroadfor any length of time, whether in or out of Government. In*e case of Britain the risk of losing touch has been compoundedthe profound and rapid changes which have taken place mthe last thirty years in British society, in Britain&apos;s placein the world and in international affairs generally - changesw*ich the nation as a whole has found difficult to assimilate.51 -   Frequently, for instance, a genuine dilemma arises inthe need to balance a style of representation appropriate to tne&quot;nited Kingdom in the last quarter of the 20th century with one^ich will help promote British influence and interests in thehost country.   These two considerations are sometimes contra^Victory.32-    The Diplomatic Service has high morale and traditions ofVhich it is justifiably proud.   These are national assets whichlt *ould be foolish to discard or under-estimate.   It is aS*ecialised service with its own important and often under-rated8kills, not least the ability to speak foreign languages and to^erstand foreign countries throughout the world.   The DiplomaticSe^ice employs some 5,000 people, fewer than 2,000 of whom are/what
what are conventionally thought of as diplomats; itscommunications experts, archivists, secretaries and securityofficers all accept the same obligation to serve anywhereoverseas; they are as essential as the diplomats to the efficient working of the Service;   and their loyalty and sense of dedicationare just as great.33. The question is one of balance.   We need to ensure thatthe qualities which distinguish the Diplomatic Service - a strongcorporate spirit and readiness to serve anywhere in the world,if need be at little notice and in difficult conditions - are notoffset by a detachment from the rest of government and of Britishsociety.A World-Wide System of Overseas Representation34. The nature of international relations and of Britishinterests in the world is such that in principle there is now agreater not a lesser need for effective overseas representation,w^en Britain was an imperial power we could and did on occasionsenforce our will.   Today the defence of our interests is mainlya matter of patient persuasion and skilful negotiation,bilaterally, multilaterally, within and through the european community.   Thus it is precisely because our power as an individual nation is diminished, while our interests remain global,that britain&apos;s future is more dependent than ever on theskills of those who represent us abroad.   There can therefore beno question of deliberately reducing the calibre of those whoare recruited for service overseas.
35.   As a permanent member of the United Nations, and because ofour special commitment to the commonwealth  /ealth, there are strong arguments for the United Kingdom to be represented even in some countries where our economic interests seem negligible. closure of missions is probably the most clear-cut way of making economies.In a small country, for example, this can save around  150,000 perannum in running costs.   Yet our capacity to influence othergovernments is severely handicapped once resident missions are withdrawn.   Even the economicr. can be illusory.   The closure of onemission in one foreign country, and the subsequent closure of thatcountry&apos;s mission in London, led to a net loss on the balance nfpayments.   We need to put our overseas expenditure on missionsabroad in proportion.    Over  P60 million vaa spent/by foreigncountries on their diplomatic representation in London as againstforeign and Commonwealth Office expenditure overseas of  137 million.None of our main industrial partners spends less than we do on overseas representation.    There are at present        British postsabroad with UK-based staff:    this is broadly in line with thenumber of posts maintained by comparable countries.    Once a missionhas closed re-opening is a costly and time-consuming business.This said, there is room for manpower and cash economies, andthe more flexible and cost-effective use of resources. Missions,even if slimmed down, tend to grow again in size and in workload.37   The introduction of mini missions with only two or a Few more people can provide useful representation at minimal cost.    It alsofacilitates a more rational deployment of resources, so that we canfocus on those countries and areas which will repay the effort made.This is now going ahead in certain countries where our interests are real but limited.   As a general rule it is preferable to with-drawal or representation from another capital.    Besides the UnitedKingdom&apos;s /33 missions there are 89 subordinate posts. Ascommunications develop, posts of this kind can sometimes be more easily closed, and 34 have disappeared since 1970.    Following a review a further six subordinate posts will be closed.    Five moreare under consideration.
3J.   There is clearly room also for further reductions in the size of missions, and of subordinate posts where this would not lead to a reduction in essential services.   Close scrutiny isbeing given, for instance, to our missions in. other community countries where officials from the Foreign and commonwealth office and from Home Departments have increasingly direct contacts with their opposite numbers, and where there may be a reduced needfor some of the resident staff on the spot.   The burden of a mission&apos;s duties and priorities varies from country to country,Oust as conditions in each country frequently change with all thatthis entails for the resources deployed.   In some cases the workload may have to be cut to match any reduction in numbers. Thereis no alternative, therefore, to a system of regular and rigorousinspection of missions and of deciding on a case-by-case basis onthe wisdom or otherwise of redeploying staff and effort. similarly the regular Inspection system will, as part of its normalresponsibilities, scrutinise the grading of posts.    There is nothingimmutable about the grading of a post or the number of posts in a given grade.y\.   An important consideration bearing on the size of missions and the number and size of subordinate posts is the question of consular services.   The Government believe that there would be widespread and justifiable public criticism if protection services were withdrawn from many posts, and that public demand for these services is bound to increase with the continued growth ofcommercial effort overseas and of tourism.    Consular services-ill therefore be maintained on approximately their present level.But consular work will in future be self-financing by increases in consular and passport fees in line with costs. Repatriationpolicy will continue to be stringent and every effort will be madeto ensure that money advanced is recovered.40.   These questions underline the crucial importance of CountryAssessment Papers (see paragraph Z4- above).   Missions and subordinatePosts are inspected at three-yearly intervals.   The Inspectors will use newly-prepared Country Assessment Papers.as working briefs. Thenew model Country Assessment Papers, incorporating the views of allthe other Government Departments concerned, should therefore ensurethat Inspectors are working to the most comprehensive and up-to-date/assessment
Assessment possible of our needs in any given country. Since* ^681 Foreign and Commonwealth Office manpower at home and overseas has been reduced by 9%* while expenditure on salariesiQri allowances at constant prices has been held steady. over this period there has been no reduction in the higher grades*rom One to Four, which have shown a slight increase.   The sametrend to retain the more senior management jobs is evident in^Qe Home Civil Service.    The Diplomatic Service will considerscope for reductions in the number of higher grade jobs.^ is also important that the decision to accept world-widecoverage with the introduction of mini missions does not contribute^0 any overall.increase in the number of higher grade posts. the diplomatic Service Inspectorate will continue to scrutinise allstablishments at home and overseas.   The Inspectorate^ task isnot, however, always to cut down;    on occasions there&quot; is a good case for increasing the priority and effort given to a particular country.11 *   The Government attach importance to ensuring that the career^ructure of the Diplomatic Service provides for flexible recruit-^^t and retirement.   A detailed review has been started which willr the manpower needs of the Service through the 1980s, takingQunt of training margins and any reductions made in the size ofPOstq A0*   An examination is in-progress of the contribution whicherent forms of recruitment, including short service contracts,make to attracting staff with relevant experience in industry,Cice and other areas of national economic life for part of^    ^ career and in improving promotion flows in the middle grades.flexibility in appointment procedures for the senior gradeseing considered.   Consideration should also be given to a^   u 1ntroduction of annual leave, both to reduce any sense of^0^eness from the United Kingdom and to ensure that Heads ofv- Sl0n and other officials in key positions can be in close touchthVerament Departments and need not be absent from their posts*s   SUCl1 lon6 periods as can occur under the present system whenCc\*       as three and a half months&apos; leave can be accumulated.S\lT 4.   j .tation is taking place with the Staff Side on these and* structural issues.
^J,   In three areas the Government have concluded that the continuous process of inspection needs to be reinforced byspecific reductions:   these are research, information and defence work.4i.   Research Work.   The Research Department of the foreign and Commonwealth Office maintains a comprehensive bank ofinformation, drawn from official and non-official sources, onforeign and Commonwealth countries;   on the DK^s relations withthem;   and on their relations with each other.   Research Departmentsupports the geographical and functional departments of the foreign and Commonwealth Office in their operational work by conductingresearch into issues as required by them and by generallyproviding a collective memory and continuity.   Research Departmentalso prepares on its own account studies in depth on particularissues.   It has the further responsibility of preparing material for public release in the Foreign Policy Document series, and inthe form of more general background studies.ff.   The role of this Department has been reviewed in the light ofcertain recommendations made by the Central Policy Review Staff.The Government are satisfied that the high quality work which itdoes is important and should continue.   But they believe thateconomies should be made.   The Government will therefore reducethe establishment of Research Department by 17% from 110 to 91*45.   Information Work.    Both the Duncan Report in 1969 and that ofthe Central Policy Review Staff last year concluded that we werecommitting too many resources to information work.   In the aftermathof the 1969 Report, there had been by the end of 1975 a reduction ofmore than 40% in our information staffs overseas.   Since January1976, when the Central Policy Review Staff started work, further reductions have taken place.44.   Information work is an area of our overseas effort where it isnotoriously difficult to quantify results.   The information servicesof the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Central Office ofInformation are designed to defend and promote overseas the currentPolicies of the Government, including the whole range of exportactivitits.
47.      The British Overseas Trade Board and other prominentbusinessmen have stated that the creation of the rightclimate of opinion overseas about the British economycontributes to the selling of exports.     Moreover, it isthe developed countries which are our more important markets,and which could provide much of the new investment we need.If our real performance is bad, this cannot be mitigatedeven by the best information work;   but our missions mustcorrect distortions where they can and present the positiveaspects of Britain&apos;s performance which are often overlooked.Government Ministers and members of the BOTB, Heads of&quot;ission and Consuls-General play a major part in this. Butat a lower level use also needs to be made of visual, statisticaland other material to demonstrate British inventiveness,nigh quality technology and general industrial stability andvigour.    information activity is also required on occasion to support specific political and economic objectives indeveloped countries.The Government are determined to maintain the effect-iveness of our information effort, especially in priorityareas such as trade.     However, as a result of a detailedReview post-by-post of our information effort, reductions inonr information staff of some 16.5% (Diplomatic Service) andlc-5% (locally-engaged) will shortly be implemented. There*iU have been a reduction of more than 26% in all information8taff Sin0e the CPRS started their Review.     This includes aEduction from 68 to 45 in the staff of the British information services in New York, which will still remain by far thela*gest single information unit overseas.     In addition there&quot;ill be a detailed scrutiny of information work in all**ure Inspections.     Some savings in the Information departments of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office may follow in dueConrse.    Significant reductions in the services provided to0v*rseas posts by the Central Office of Information have takenPlace Since the CFRS started their Review and further streaa-lining win ^e considered.
Defence Work.    There has already been considerable rational-nation of defence work.   In the last four years the number ofservice Attaches and supporting posts has been cut by 10%. The^umbers of British defence staff in Washington - our largestdefence establishment attached to any mission overseas - have beenreduced by 35% over 12 years.   There is still an important require-^fct for Service Attache posts in support of defence cooperation,^fence sales, information gathering and a combination of thesetasks.   But there is also scope for further reductions..      It has been decided that the precise savings possible will be^^ned on a post-by-post basis;   but the Government have set aviQgs target of 25%, and the Defence Secretary will seek to ensure^    it is met by examining critically the level of staffingeluding the possibility of replacing resident with visiting^    f and single Service Attaches with a Defence Attache); theflection of defence information;   the deployment and* selectionfo ^e^ence attaches;    the provision by missions of support staffsAttaches;   and the possibility of seconding Attaches andPorting staff to the Diplomatic Service.^ -*s was noted in paragraph ZZ t the work of most Departments has^^^i^icant overseas dimension, to which our overseas represent-must contribute effectively.   The following paragraphs containVernment1 s views on export services, education and cultural&apos; ^ne BBCfs External Services and aid, which make up ancant part of our integrated overseas representation effort.^gPort Services.   The Government have decided after careful8^ ation that the present structure and organisation are broadly5e   S^satisfactory, and the Government will continue to provide export?QS*   The British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB), set up in 1972,*ea C^8es strategic control over the export effort and is primarily^    8i&amp;le for coordination between Government and industry.0^o^^r^Nationalists are in the majority on the Board.   The Area Advisoryi^. t of the BOTB, made up of businessmen with wide experience inco**    Ua* markets, make a major contribution.   The BOTB has runV ft     Ces on export development in 17 regional centres, attended^,000 companies, and the staff of the Board have, over the/past
past year, made about 10,000 visits to companies.   There havebeen over 7,000 participants in Fairs and Exhibitions under B0TBsponsorship and some 2,500 participants in the Board&apos;s OverseasTrade Missions.   The Department of Trade has recently introducedimprovements in the coordination of export promotion services:a Trade directorate has been set up to strengthen links between those sections responsible for trade policy, export promotion,and export credit guarantees.   Some restructuring of the divisionsconcerned with export promotion has also taken place and a newExport Policy Branch has been set up.   A Paid Technical Cooperation^it has been established in the Ministry of Overseas Development.53.   Market and product concentration is already part of thePractice of the export promotion services.   The Government agreed with the DEASC that the export promotion services are most effectivewhen they support and augment activities which firms or sectors ofindustry believe to he in their commercial interest.   The government also agree with the DEASC&apos;s assessment of the importance to the^itish economy of invisible earnings, and confirm their commitment^ allocate resources at home and abroad in a way which takes full account of the requirements of firms involved in invisible exports,^graphically, there has been a significant redeployment of^sources towards the oil-exporting countries since 197*, and^other changes to concentrate resources more on particular markets of Products will be based on the B0TB&apos;s on-going consultations with industry, and in response to opportunities as they arise. TheBQTB has close links with the Sector Working Parties, and will paypa*ticular attention to suggestions arising in the context of theindustrial strategy.*   The deployment of export promotion staff overseas, and thenat*re of the export effort itself, will vary from country toCou*try.   In countries where political and economic decisions^ the hands of a small group, the role of the mission as aVhola, and their ability to secure access to and influence overthia ruling group, will be critical to the success of the exportirive.   In the state trading countries, commercial officers inEssies have an important role to play in familiarising business-106,1 *ith what may at first seem an impenetrable bureaucracy. This/is
f! not so necessary in developed, free market economies, where firms are moreQlailiar with the market; but even here they often need help over introduc-*0ns, local rules and regulations, and the many non-tariff barriers to trade,a^ in such markets the export promotion services have a major role to playfathering and disseminating information about market opportunities and in^ing arrangements for British exporters to be strongly represented at fairs and similar promotions.Educational and Cultural Work.     The value of this category of aci.tivityaQnot be quantified, but the Government believe that it plays a distinctive&quot;Valuable role in projecting Britain abroad, in furthering relationships^    other countries and in stimulating the use of the English language.^Parative figures for expenditure are hard to obtain, but it is clear^    France and Germany spend more than the United Kingdom in this field.v^ational aid too has an important part to play in our relationshipdeveloping countries and is often a welcome and useful form ofstance.    In particular it is important to sustain and where possiblee*tend the work which is done in spreading a knowledge of the English^gUage anci ^n promoting its cultural and diplomatic use.^0 maintain a coherent policy, governmental involvement and supportindispensable.    The Briitsh Council is one of the instruments throughoritam&apos;s longer-term national interests are, and will continue to be,re 1110tad.   The Government do not accept the Central Policy Review StaffOtoniendation for the abolition of the Council.   But they consider that0seraHd      Coordination is required with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,^   also v/ith the Ministry of Overseas Development and the EducationCo^rtments.   It is particularly important that the Council&apos;s valuable^^ri^ution in the field of   educational aid should be implemented fullyln the scope of aid policies determined by Ministers.^    ^here may be further scope for rationalising our educational andoVe^   a^ activities; and for intergrating them more effectively into ourOf ^ eas ^presentation as a whole.     A country-by-country examination^       far separate British Council offices abroad could be merged with0      QS is being conducted on the presumption that mergers, particularly*ea ^^istrative support, should be effected unless there are goodIor the retention of separate establishments. Considerationsvary from country to country. ./in
In some, for example, a separate British Council office haseasier access to schools and colleges than a diplomatic missionwould have.    In others it has &quot;been useful at times to be able tomaintain a separate British Council presence in countries wherediplomatic relations have in the past been broken off.58.   The Government believe that it would be desirable for theBritish Council&apos;s structure and administration to be looked atcarefully, and a Management Review is to be undertaken.   In advanceof this Review, and as a basis for it, Ministers after consulting the British Council will formulate a clear and considered view ofwbat they believe the Council&apos;s role and areas of activity shouldbe.SI.   In the area of education aid, the Government see a continuing*ole for the British Council and for the Inter-University council which provides a useful channel for our own universities tocontribute their expert knowledge.   They are considering the nationalisation of the activities of these bodies and of thetechnical Education and Training Organisation for overseas countries and their relationship to the Education Departments^d the Ministry of Overseas Development.BBC External Services.   The Government agree with the CPRS^d the Expenditure Committee that the nation benefits from the^que reputation of the BBC&apos;s External Services as a well-informed^d unbiased source of world news and comments, and from theattention which is therefore paid to the information they provideabout Britain and British policies.   Their complete independencefl,om the Government means that they can be more effective andinfluential than the Government&apos;s own information service. the bbc&apos;s External Services are a proven success and represent aNational asset which we should be careful to preserve.t!*   The Government have decided that the World Service in EnglishwiU continue to be broadcast for 24 hours a day.   To abandon the round-the-clock service would damage our national interests anddeputation out of all proportion to any financial savings thatmiSht be derived.
Cuts can however be made in some of the vernacular services.The pattern of vernacular services should not be regarded asimmutable.   A review of all the vernacular services is beingcarried out in order to examine ways of concentrating resourceswhere they can be put to the best use.   But financial savings madein this area will be small in comparison with the increase in capital expenditure which is now necessary to maintain the ExternalServices1 audibility.   The Government have authorised planning toDe undertaken to maintain audibility within the BBCs estimate ofwnat it considers technically essential.   The necessary capital investment programme is expected to cost some  20 million (at 1977Prices) over the next five years.t3-   Aid.    Some considerations of aid and trade have been covered in the Government&apos;s White Paper in answer to the Report of theSelect Committee on Overseas Development (Crond 7213)i which wasitself prepared against t^e background of relevant recommendations in the CPRS Review.   The^Review itself broadly endorsed currentaid policies and procedures, while suggesting that there should bea Management Review to take account of the increased size and complexity of the Aid Programme since the foundation of the^nistry in 1964-.    Our aid strategy continues as set out in the^75 White Paper &quot;More Help for the Poorest&quot; (Cmnd 6270). The^location of United Kingdom aid is based primarily on the concept of need, while also taking into account a number of other consider-ations reflecting our wider interests and historical links. these include political and commercial factors.About two-thirds of our aid is disbursed direct to individual countries;    the remainder indirectly through multilateral organis-ations.    Bilateral programmes need to be carefully related to thecircumstances of the recipient countries, and for this reason therels often justification for very small programmes despite theirsometimes relatively high administrative costs.   The government accept that a critical eye should be kept on this, in the liRht ofthe CPRS Review.    It is also agreed that the Ministry of overseas development will be included in the programme of Management reviews of Government Departments which is now under way.    Other importantproposals in the/Review which have been adopted include the making^ /of
of further efforts to simplify the terms under which technicalcooperation officers serve abroad and the rationalisation ofschemes under which students are brought to and supported inthe United Kingdom.   The Government have decided to allow asmall proportion of the bilateral aid programme to be availableto give higher priority to the commercial and industrialimportance of a limited number of developmentally sound projectswe identify in developing countries for which there is no prioraid allocation available.fc5.   Control of Entry into the United Kingdom.   A separate white paper is being published in response to the report of the SelectCommittee on Race Relations and Immigration, and will cover someof the recommendations made by the CPRS.   The Government&apos;s response to the other recommendations is given in the Annex,CONCLUSIONS
jji CONCLUSIONStt.   In the last fifteen years there have been three major reviews of our overseas representation:   the Plowden Committee reported onrepresentational services overseas in February 1964;   the DuncanCommittee published its report on overseas representation in July^969;   and most recently the Central Policy Review Staff in 1977Reviewed both the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and all aspects0r British representation overseas.   In 1971 the House cf CommonsExpenditure Committee formed the Defence and External Affairs Sub-Committee which has produced a number of repoite relating to over-Qeas representation and most recently published in March 1978 itsreview of the Central Policy Review Staff Report.   The frequency ofall these reviews has been a clear reflection of britain&apos;s needrapidly and radically to adjust to the new and hitherto constantlyevolving demands of the post-War world:   to the creation of the atlantic Alliance, to the dismantling of the finpire, to the with-^withdrawal from east of Suez.   In 1973 perhaps the most far-reaching0^ all the post-War re-Orient at ions of British foreign policy tookPlace - entry into the European Community.   More than any other8lngle factor, this has altered the international framework withinwhich British foreign policy operates.   Now that the initial fiveyear period of our Community membership is completed, the need toreapprai8e today our overseas representation is as relevant as itWas in 1963 or 1969:^   The detailed measures to which this reappraisal has led or will*ead, and which are set out in detail in the preceding chapter, cansummarised as follows:(l)   There will be a programme of interchange between theForeign and Commonwealth Office and  &amp;uttu*w GovernmentDepartments.   The programme will achieve one hundred additionalsecondments in each direction over the next four to five yearsand will be supervised by Ministers.   The programme will be supplemented by short-term attachments and/The joint trainingof members of the Home Civil Service and Diplomatic Service. The/Government
Government will consider the feasibility of extending inter-change to industry, commerce, banking and the trade unions.(2) An intensive review of training for Diplomatic Servicecommercial officers is nearing completion.(3) A system of wide but cost-effective representationoverseas will be established with mini-missions in countries where British interests are limited.    The Government willtake steps to ensure that this does not lead to an increasein the number of higher grade posts.OO   Mini missions apart, there is a clear need for further reductions in the size of posts.   There will be a criticalexamination of the size and grading of missions.(5) Six subordinate posts will be closed and the closure of five more is under consideration.   Reductions in the size of subordinate posts will also be considered.(6) The establishment of Research Department in the foreign and Commonwealth will be cut by Y?% from 110 to 91.(7) As a result of a post-by-post review there will be a cut in information staff serving overseas of some 16.5$ (diplomatic service) and 10.5* (locally engaged).   Savings in theInformation Departments of the Foreign and Commonwealth Officefcay follow, and reductions in some of the services provided bythe Central Office of Information are under consideration.(8) The Government aim to cut defence staff abroad by 25$.The precise details will depend on a post-by-post review.(9) A detailed review cf the long-term manpower needs of the diplomatic Service has been set in hand.   The emphasis of this review will be on flexible recruitment and retirement. a review of different forms of recruitment to the diplomatic service is in progress and will cover, among other ttlngs,^ort-term contracts.   More flexible appointment procedures/for
for senior grades are being considered, as is the phasedintroduction of annual leave to ensure that diplomatic service personnel serving abroad keep in touch with home departments and are not absent from their posts for over-long periods because of accumulated leave.(10) There will be joint consultation and agreementbetween the Foreign and commonwealth  /ealth Office and the relevantHome Departments on the priorities, policies and resources to be deployed in any given country.    This will be effected by means of jointly produced Country Assessment Papers.There will from time to time be major policy papers on external issues produced by the Foreign and commonwealth office in conjunction with the relevant Home Department.(11) The Government will publish two new series of papers:Foreign Policy documents and Background Briefs.    These willbe designed to increase the flow of available publicinformation about the formulation and conduct of foreignpolicy.(IP)   A country-by-country review has been put in hand tosee hov; far separate British Council offices abroad can be merged with missions, on the presumption that mergers shouldbe effected unless there are good reasons for the retentionof separate establishments.(13) The British Council&apos;s role, structure and administration will be reviewed.(14) The Government are considering possible ways ofrationalising education aid activities of the british council, the Technical Education and Training organisation for Overseas Countries and the Inter-University Council,and their relationship to the Education Departments and theMinistry of Overseas Development.(15) The BBCs world-wide service will be maintained on s24-hour basis.   All the -vernacular -Services will be reviewed.
(16) The Government have authorised planning to beundertaken to maintain audibility within the BBCsestimate of what it technically considers essential.The necessary capital investment programme is expectedto cost some  20 million over the next five years.(17) Smaller aid programmes will be critically examined.(18) There will be a Management Review of the Ministryof Overseas Development.Against the background of these changes, some of the main features of the present system of overseas representation willbe preserved in their essentials.    Responsibility for the overallconduct of overseas relations in the broadest sense of the termwill continue to be vested in a single Cabinet Minister, namely&quot;the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, sothat the right level of political coordination and input ismaintained.    There will continue to be integrated staffing inPosts abroad, under the control of the Hend of Mission, to reflect^e authority exercised by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs in the conduct of Britain1a external relations,A separate Diplomatic Service will be maintained because of its^vantages as a small, flexible and professional service. TheGovernment will continue to provide export and consular protectionservices.    The British Council will continue to be one of the instruments through which the United Kingdom&apos;s longer-term interests are promoted.W     Taken together, the changes and new guidelines set out above,if implemented steadily over the next five years, will enable our0verseas representation effectively to meet the challenges of thelast quarter of this century.   These changes are deliberatelyevolutionary in character.    They aim to build on that which isalready good, efficient and of proven value;   yet also to establish a Pattern capable of adapting to the future on the basis of a realistic but confident assessment of Britain&apos;s role in the world.
