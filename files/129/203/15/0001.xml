QCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 90COPY no 6 September 1978CABINETTHE BINGHAM ENQUIRYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for foreign and Commonwealth affairs* We hope to publish the Bingham Report next week, subject to thenecessary consents from those who gave evidence.    If any of these arewithheld, we shall have to let it be known that it is not the government who are delaying publication.2. The main findings of the Bingham Report are:-i.       During two periods (1966-68 and 1972-76) a British registeredcompany, Shell Mozambique, was intermediary in the supply of oil which was delivered to Rhodesia.    The company is jointly owned by Shell and British Petroleum (BP).ii.       In the first period, the London management of the oilcpmpanies were initially unaware of this involvement, and put anend to it as soon as it came to their notice.    In the second periodcertain London-based executives became aware of the renewedinvolvement in 1974;  they gave orders that it should cease;  the BPexecutive concerned believed (wrongly) that the orders had been implemented;  btftt the state of knowledge of the Shell executive is less clear.iii. Her Majesty&apos;s Government were told after the event of theinvolvement of Shell Mozambique during 1966-68, and accepted asolution which, while taking the British-controlled company out ofthe line of physical supply, did not diminish the supply of oil to rhodesia.    Ministers recognised that the South African subsidiaries of Shell and BP would continue to fulfil and conclude contracts withcustomers in South Africa, as they were required to do by SouthAfrican law, even if there was strong suspicion that the customerswere forwarding their supplies to Rhodesia.iv. Her Majesty1 s Government did not know of the involvement ofShell Mozambique during 1972-76.1
v.       A small number of Shell and BP executives in London know of the continuing business between the South African subsidiaries of the two companies (which are not of course subject to UnitedKingdom sanctions legislation) and forwarding agents acting forthe Rhodesian purchasing organisation.    Between 1968 and 1975an estimated 1, 880, 000 tons of product were supplied.vi.       It is probable but not absolutely certain that since 1976 theSouth African subsidiaries of Shell and BP have not sold to anyintermediary known to be selling on to Rhodesia.3. Mr BinghanVs terms of reference directed him towards the mechanicsof the oil trade and possible breaches of British sanctions legislation. Hewas not directly concerned to analyse discussions within Whitehall but wasgiven access to a large volume of Government papers.    These included asmall number of Cabinet Committee documents for the years 1966-68.4. In the Report Mr Bingham sketc&amp;es in the general political background to Ministerial decisions, although he is scrupulous in avoiding reference to cabinet papers or to specific discussions in Cabinet Committees. Hestresses that all decisions of policy towards Rhodesia were takencollectively:&quot;All significant questions concerning British policy towardsRhodesia and the enforcement of sanctions were the subjectof consideration and decision at the highest levels ofGovernment.&quot;Lord Thomson1 s evidence (quoted in the Report) makes the same point.5. In view of the intense Press speculation we will have to decide ifany further action should be taken to ensure that the Whitehall background to the oil sanctions issue in 1966-68 is fully understood, and to deal with questions about the discrepancies between what Bingham says about theextent to which Ministers were then involved, and what has been said inrecent public statements.D A L OForeign and Commonwealth Office6 September 19782
