DQCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(78) 81 COPY NO8017 July 1978CABINETCONTINGENCY RESERVE 1978-79Note by the Chief Secretary, Treasuryl- The Cabinet will wish to know where we stand on the contingency reserve for the current year.    Annex A summarioes the figures.2.        We began with a Reserve of  750 million at 1977 Survey prices, whichtranslates into a figure of  815 million at 1978 Survey prices.    (All figures are at 1978 Survey prices unless otherwise stated).3- We have now used up  624 million, mainly on items announced in,0* before, the Budget (see Annex A).4- The balance remaining is therefore  191 million.5- The Budget forecasts assumed that actual spending would be some*2 billion below the White Paper figures.    Reductions identified so far havebeen small.    We have also not been able, through the national insurancesurcharge,&apos;to recoup fully the revenue lost through amendments to thefinance Bill.6- There is therefore very little margin for manoeuvre.    We shall need^ husband the remaining Contingency Reserve carefully to meet genuinecontingencies and other requirements which may emerge later in the year.The Cabinet will want to take this into account in considering the proposal in cp(78) 82 for a winter fuel scheme.J treasury Chambers17 July 1978
