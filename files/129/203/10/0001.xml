THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78)85 COPY NO 8025 July 1978CABINETDEBATES ON COMMUNITY legislation memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilINTRODUCTIONI have discussed with colleagues in the Ministerial Group on debates on Community Legislation (GEN 138) the alternative proposals for aResolution of the House set out in my minute of 18 July.PRESENT POSITION2. In my written answer of 4 August 1976 I gave a formal undertakingon behalf of the Government that Community legislative proposalsrecommended for debate by the Scrutiny Committee would be debatedbefore Ministers agreed to them in the Council unless:either a. the Scrutiny Committee recommended that they could beagreed without waiting for a debate;orb. the Minister concerned saw fit to give his agreement inadvance of a debate, in which case he would subsequently explainhis action to the House.This undertaking is quoted in paragraph 1 of the Annex and has been honouredwithout difficulty.DISCUSSION3. In the light of the Group&apos;s discussion I do not at this stage press my view that a Minister1 s agreement in the latter case (2 b. above) should be conditional on the subsequent approval of the House, rather than a mereexplanation of his action.
4. I therefore seek the agreement of Cabinet that I should move a motion converting the existing undertaking as it stands into a resolution of the House as shown in paragraph 2 of the Annex.    A majority of mycolleagues in the Group could accept this if they could be assured that wecould carry it without amendment.    I will report orally to Cabinet on whether this condition can be met.5. Some of my colleagues in the Group were opposed to this proposal on the ground that the undertaking would become far more binding ifconverted into a Resolution of the House on a Government Motion;  and would create a precedent for future Parliamentary encroachment on Ministerialpowers.    Others shared my view that the precedent could be limited andthe commitment justified on the ground that the approval of Communitylegislation is a use of Ministerial powers in the legislative area, whichwould otherwise be within the competence of Parliament.6. If my enquiries reveal that we cannot be sure of carrying myproposed Motion unamended or if my colleagues cannot agree to it, theonly other way of redeeming my promise of a debate would be a Motion fora Resolution approving the undertaking, as in paragraph 3 of the Annex.We might be outvoted on amendments withholding or qualifying Parliament&apos;approval but they would not directly affect the terms of the undertaking.recommendation. I will make a final recommendation to Cabinet as between the courses set out in paragraphs 4 and 6 above in the light of consultations with our own backbenchers, other Parties and the Scrutiny Committee.M FPrivy Council Office25 July 19782
