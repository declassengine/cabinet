CP(78) 9225 September 1978CABINETTHE QUEEN&apos;S SPEECHES ON THE PROROGATION and opening OF parliament memorandum by the Lord President of the council. I attach drafts for The queen s Speeches on the Prorogation and opening of Parliament (Annexes A and B).    They have been considered byThe Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QF) and they also take account of contributions and comments by Departmental Ministers whoare not members of QF.2. The Prorogation Speech is reasonably straightforward, and I invitemy colleagues to approve it.3. QF considered that we should aim for an Opening Speech which wouldmaximise support from the minority Parties, and that we should avoidmaterial which would be unnecessarily provocative even though it might be welcome to our own supporters.    At the same time it must demonstrate afull programme of worthwhile legislative and administrative measures. Asregards presentation, QF considered that it should bring out three or fourpositive themes to which particular measures would be related: our discussion on 14 September is relevant here (CM(78) 31st Conclusions,Minute 4).4. The draft has been prepared with these points in mind.    Some of thematerial is still provisional, since it requires collective approval of thepolicy or agreement to the public expenditure which would be involved: thesepassages are indicated by square brackets.    I hope decisions will be obtained,either in Cabinet itself or in the appropriate policy committee, before thedraft has to be submitted to The Queen.    My colleagues may also wish tohave a further opportunity to consider particular aspects of the draft - either in Cabinet or QF - after the Party Conference.copy NO
a. The references to additional finance for the Scottish and welsh Development Agencies and to legislation on short-time working(page 9, first paragraph);  to the timing of the Bill on industrial democracy (page 9* last paragraph);  and to the Bill on organicchange (page 10, second paragraph) are still subject to policy clearanceand the form of words may need to be adjusted when the policy isfinally defined.b. The draft reflects the view of some members of QF that weshould commit ourselves firmly to legislation on Section 2 in thecoming Session and to fresh action towards more open government(page 10, first paragraph).    I recognise that some of my colleagueshave different views and I hope we can reach at least provisional agreement before the party Conference.c. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has proposed legislation to require all local authorities to issue free school milk to children in junior schools (page 10, last paragraph).    The chief secretary, Treasury, considers that a decision on this proposal should be taken as part of our discussions on public expendituregenerally, since it would involve forgoing savings which would bemade under the present discretionary system.    A Bill for thispurpose would however be an attractive proposal to include inThe Queen&apos;s Speech if agreement can be reached in time.d. The Lord Chancellor has proposed a reference to the Bill onlegal aid (page 11, first paragraph).    This Bill is part of the programmset out in CP(78) 79 but again it does not yet have financial cover.Similar considerations apply.e. The Secretary of State for Social Services has proposed a reference to a Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill (page 11,first paragraph).    The need for this Bill has emerged since thelegislative programme was drawn up, but he considers it to be urgent.The proposal- are subject to collective policy clearance and Cabinetagreement to the Public Expenditure Survey bid relating to mobilityallowance.6* QF also considered that material which should be omitted fromThe Queen&apos;s Speech on grounds of length or because it would be unnecessarilyProvocative to the minority Parties might nevertheless be included in thePrime Minister1 s speech in the debate on the Address if, for example, itwould be particularly welcome to our own supporters or if the Government&apos;sproposals might otherwise be thought to have been abandoned. Exampleswould include legislation on Post Office workers&apos; right to take industrial action the reorganisation of the electricity supply industry, broadcasting and films.2
a. Approve the draft of the Prorogation Speech as at Annex A.b. Give provisional approval to the draft of the Opening speech at Annex B, subject to any necessary further consideration of thepolicy issues indicated in paragraph 5 above, and to any finaldiscussion which may be needed after the Party Conference.c. Note the material which it is suggested should be includedin the Prime Ministers speech.M FPrivy Council Office25 September 19783
