THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 79 COPY NO13 July 1978CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1978-79Memorandum by the Lord President of the council. This memorandum and its Appendices set out a possible legislative programme for the 1978-79 Session.    It reflects discussion in The queen speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QF) and points made in subsequent correspondence with colleagues who are not members of QF.It is based on the assumption that next Session will be the last of the present parliament, and in view of the uncertain Parliamentary situation it includesin Appendix IV a list of Bills to which we might wish to affirm, or re-affirm,our commitment in The Queen&apos;s Speech, while not necessarily expecting to enact them in the course of this Parliament.    These Bills could of course be brought forward for enactment if circumstances proved favourable.Otherwise the suggested programme is based on the usual division intoEssential, Contingent and Programme Bills (Appendices I - III), with separate lists of Bills suitable for Second Reading Committee procedureor Scottish Grand Committee, which do not make significant claims on floortime in the House of Commons (Appendices V and VI).    For completeness,I have added a list of those Bills for which Departmental Ministers originallymade bids in the Essential or Programme categories but which QF do not recommend for introduction next Session (Appendix VII).2. In a Session of normal length, we could in my view expect to enactall the Bills listed in the Essential and Programme categories, togetherwith any in the Contingent list - for example, the Deep Sea Mining Bill -which became Essential in the course of the Session.    As always, andespecially in present circumstances, the earlier a Bill can be introduced the more chance it has of reaching the Statute Book, so I would again urgecolleagues to press ahead with obtaining policy clearance, where this hasnot already been done, and to have their Bills drafted as soon as possible.I have already told colleagues that I am ready to give drafting authority forBills in the Essential, Programme and Second Reading Committeecategories, and for those in Appendix IV, as soon as collective policyapproval is obtained.1
3. There is no reference in the suggested programme to legislation on industrial democracy.    This is because we are unlikely to want to proceedwith a Bill on this subject in the present Parliament, although colleagues will be aware that work is proceeding on the preparation of legislation aspolicy decisions are taken.4. I recognise that, in addition to the Bills listed in the Appendices,there may be additional bids to consider in the light of events - for exampleon the repeal and replacement of Section 11 of the Local Government Act 1966.5. Finally, I have been conscious of the work of the ad hoc group onthe Wider Implications of the Industrial Strategy, with its emphasis on theneed to avoid placing additional burdens on industry.    Some of the Bills inthe programme will have this effect, and colleagues will wish to consider this aspect in framing the detail of their legislative proposals; but it doesnot seem to me that any of the proposed Bills should be abandoned on that account.6. I invite my colleagues to endorse the attached proposals for nextSession1 s legislative programme.M FPrivy Council Office13 July 19782
