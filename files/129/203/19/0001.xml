CP(78) 94 COPY NO27 September 1978CABINETRHODE SI AN SANCTIONS:  FURTHER INQUIRYNote by the Prime Minister1. Subsequent to the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 21 September (CM(78) 32ndConclusions, Minute 4) the Attorney General has received a preliminaryconfidential report from the Director of Public Prosecutions.    I think mycolleagues should be aware of the conclusions which the Attorney General hasdrawn from this report.    These are attached at Annex A.2. At Annex B I attach a note to me by the Secretary of the Cabinetdealing with two factual points raised &quot;during last week&apos;s discussion.LJC10 Downing Street27 September 1978
ANNEX ANote by the Attorney general  draw the following conclusions from the preliminary confidential report tome from the Director of Public Prosecutions:-a. Publication of Bingham (minus Annex 3) has not created suchprejudice that prosecutions cannot be contemplated.b. It would be wrong to prosecute in respect of the events of 1966-68,which were substantially condoned in 1968.c. There is a prima facie case against companies and directors inrespect of breaches commencing in about 1971 in clear disregard toearlier assurances.d. Whether and to what extent these later breaches were condonedby Government is not apparent from Bingham and may not become apparent in advance of the study of the then Administration^ papers.e. Apart from possible condonation, there is a substantial case for normal enforcement of the law by prosecution;   strong public interestwill be needed to override it.f. Summary prosecution would not measure up to the seriousness of the offences;  trial on indictment is appropriate.g. In view of the time required for police enquiries and the normalperiods required for committal proceedings and trial, trial is unlikely to take place within a year.h. If a 1921 Act Tribunal of Inquiry or any other form of public inquiry were to be held, prosecutions would be virtually ruled out.i. If a Royal Commission or other inquiry of a similar characterwere establiLhed, even if it sat in private, wide terms of referencewould virtually rule out prosecutions.j.       If a Royal Commission or other inquiry of a similar characterwere established, with narrow terms of reference, and if it satsubstantially in private, the possibility of prosecutions would notnecessarily be ruled out from the start;  it might still be found,however, that the inquiry could not properly perform its function inthe absence of a grant by myself of immunity from prosecution.
k.      If such an inquiry as is contemplated under j. were announced, Ishould as soon as practicable discuss with the Chairman the questionwhether immunity from prosecution was required to enable the inquiry to perform its function;  this question would be kept under review if no immediate decision were practicable.1.       On any basis, therefore, the establishment of an inquiry could result in the abandonment of police investigations with a view toprosecution, even if they were at an advanced stage.The decisions -i. whether to grant consent to prosecutions for breach of the sanctions Order; and ii. whether to grant immunity from prosecutionare decisions for the Director and myself as Attorney General.
Note by the Secretary of the cabinet a SPECIAL COMMISSIONDuring the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 21 September (CM(78) 32nd Conclusions,Minute 4) reference was made to the possibility of establishing a special commission on the lines of those set up in 1888 to enquire into &quot;Charges andallegations made against certain Members of Parliament&quot;, and in 1916 to enquire into &quot;The origin, inception and conduct of operations of war in theDardanelles and Gallipoli, and into the origin, inception and conduct of operations of war in Mesopotamia&quot;.    I have looked at these precedents. Ineach case the inquiry was set up by specific legislation and each was givenwide power8 including &quot;all such powers as are vested in the High Court ... inrespect of ... enforcing the attendance of witnesses . . . compelling theproduction of documents;  and the punishing of persons guilty of contempt&quot;.Nevertheless in the case of the Dardanelles Commission the Governmentrefused on general grounds of principle to produce the records of WarCommittees and this problem was finally resolved by showing them to theChairman of the Commission only.     The subsequent judgment of mosthistorians seems to have been that the Commission was not in fact able toadopt a wholly judicial attitude and that its findings were coloured by theemotions of the time.    The decisive point seems however to be that Acts ofParliament were required to confer powers because the Tribunal of Inquiry(Evide nee) Act 1921 was not on the Statute Book.    One of the purposes of thatAct was to replace Special Commissions.DISCLOSURE OF CABINET DOCUMENTSI have considered the authorisation that would be required for the disclosure of Cabinet documents.    There is no precedent for what would be involved butI think there are two aspects, law and convention.    So far as law isconcerned, if an inquiry is given power to call for papers and asks to see cabinet papers the Government would have to produce them unless it claimedCrown privilege.    By law there would be no formal need to consult a previous Administration.    The statement at the head of each Cabinetdocument that &quot;This document is the property of Her Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment&quot; in practice means that it is the property of the Crown and thepresent Government rather than that of a Government which no longer exists.The long-established convention is however that a Government does not have access to the Cabinet papers of a previous Administration of a differentpolitical complexion.    It is arguably difficult to produce papers to which one has not had access.    Both convention and courtesy would therefore indicateconsultation with the Opposition if Cabinet papers of the 1970-74 conservative government are to be produced.    The next question is consultation with whom?    You may decide to consult Mrs Thatcher about the form of anyfurther inquiry:  but I am clear that agreement to produce the papers of the
1970-74 Administration is a matter for Mr Heath and that it would be a matter for him to decide whether he wanted to consult any of his former colleagues.In so far as the papers of the 1964-70 Government are concerned, theconvention about papers of a different political Party does not arise:  but itwould be a courtesy to consult Sir Harold Wilson.
