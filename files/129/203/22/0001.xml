CP(78) 97 COPY NO0 &apos;J9 October 1978CABINETCHRISTMAS BONUSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services and theMinister for Social Security1. A Christmas Bonus is not high among our social priorities, but inthe present political situation colleagues may like the opportunity of considering its attractions.    This paper accordingly considers a  10payment, although there may be pressure for a higher amount.COVERAGE2. Past bonuses have principally covered long-term beneficiaries -retirement and supplementary pensioners, widows and the long-term sick.To cover those categories again would cost  105 million, including 3 million for administration.3. In our view, however, there is a strong case for extending any bonusto other groups in financial need.    Payment to recipients of the long-termrate of supplementary benefit (SB) would cover many one-parent families.It should also go to people who have been drawing family income supplement(FIS) or the short-term rate of SB for a minimum period.    FIS coveragewould help the hardest-pressed families among the working population; halfof them would be one-parent families.    Extension to recipients of SB at the short-term rate will help compensate them for the fact that next month&apos;suprating of short-term benefits (based on the Treasury forecast of 7.1 percent price increases in the 12 months since November 1978) will clearly notmatch actual price inflation, now expected to be 8. 8 per cent.4. To extend the bonus to people drawing SB at the long-term rate, and tothose who have been receiving either the short-term rate or FIS continuouslyfor 12 months, would cost an extra  7 million, including  1 million for administration.    But a 12-month qualifying period would not permit the bonusto be paid to many people who have been unemployed for a year, since it is common for the contributory benefits payable to an unemployed person to keephim above the SB level for six months.    Thus, in order to cover nearly all theunemployed people who have been claiming benefit fer more than a year, we
propose that the condition for the bonus should be continuous receipt of SB (orFIS) for six months. This would add a further  2 million to the benefit cost.Extra administrative costs would be negligible.5. We acknowledge that there are drawbacks to a bonus which is payablemore widely than to last year&quot;s categories:-i. We should be heavily dependent on staff goodwill for a majorclerical operation at a time when many offices will be under pressurebecause of the uprating and the start of the new pension scheme.ii. Even with full staff co-operation, payment of the bonus to thenew categories - which would begin in December, when payments aremade to pensioners - might extend into January or even February.iii. There could be complaints of rough justice (for example, wherethe previous six months contained a very short period off SB whichdebarred someone from the bonus).    Further, the greater number ofqualifying benefits would increase the risk of duplicate payment.Nevertheless in our view it would be both fairer and politically more attracted-tive for any bonus this year to include the principal groups of poor people whohave been excluded in the past, and we so recommend.DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS6. About 40 per cent of total expenditure on the bonus will go to house-holds in the lowest 20 per cent of the income distribution, corrected forhousehold size and composition.    A further 27 per cent will go to householdsin the next highest 20 per cent and the remaining 33 per cent of expenditure will go to households in the top 60 per cent of the income distribution, mainly to retired persons with higher pensions and other income.    The  10 bonuswill represent approximately 30 per cent of the average weekly disposableincome of recipients in the lowest 20 per cent of the income distribution.There will remain, however, some 38 per cent of households in this lowestquintile, an estimated 1.4 million households, who will not receive the bonus.These will be mainly the working poor who do not qualify for FIS, and those on short-term benefits.MANPOWER AND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE IMPLICATIONS7. Our proposals above would mean that a bonus would go to pensioners and others covered last year - 10. 2 million in total.    It would be extended toabout 700, 000 recipients of SB and nearly 70, 000 families on FIS.    The totalcost, including administration, would be  114 million.    This would have tocome from the contingency reserve and would reduce the uncommittedbalance for 1978-79 to around  42 million.    Any further unavoidable require-ments arising in the remainder of the financial year would have to be met
predominantly from savings already identified (or to be identified) in the programmes concerned.    Provided that this is accepted, the reserve couldaccommodate a bonus of  10, but no more.    As last year, the bonus would come from voted monies, with a Money Resolution drawn so as to preclude,as far as possible, amendments to increase the sum or further widen itspayment.8. The administrative cost of the bonus (included in the  11 million above)would be  4 million.    To the Department of Health and Social Securityadministration cost of about  3 million for paying the bonus to last year&apos;scategories (which includes the cost of some 165 man years) the proposedwidening of coverage would add a further  1 million (including an extra155 man years).    This addition to the Department of Health and social security administrative costs cannot be met without raising our cash limit for administration for 1978-79 by  4 million.    As no manpower provision wasmade to enable the Department to service a Christmas Bonus in 1978, and theDepartments manpower forecasts indicate that there would be little or nothing to spare, authority would be needed for the total of 320 man years forcasuals and overtime required for a bonus payment.TIMING9. Royal Assent would be needed by Friday 24 November if the PostOffice is to pay pensioners in the week beginning 4 December.    It will there-fore be essential to introduce the Bill as soon as the new Session begins.CONCLUSION10. The views of Cabinet are sought on the expenditure from the contin-gency reserve of  114 million (and the provision of an additional 320 man yearsof staff work within the Department of Health and Social Security) for a 1978Christmas Bonus, payable in the week of 4 December to pensioners, widows and the other groups covered last year, and as soon as possible thereafter tothose on the long-term rate of SB and to those who have been drawing short-term SB, or FIS, for six months or more.    If Cabinet approved such a bonus,its immediate announcement by the Secretary of State  for Social services would be desirable so that preliminary work can start now:  this would reducethe risk of staff troubles leading to delay in payment and to difficulties for thepublic.D ES ODepartment of Health and Social Security9 October 1978
