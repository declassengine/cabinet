The Eighth Report of the Expenditure Committee, Session 1977-78,was published in July and comprised an introduction by the main committee and chapters prepared separately by the specialist sub-committees.    The subjects covered by the chapters were: defence expenditure;   regional and selective assistance to industry; housing;provision for museums, galleries and libraries;  health and personal social services and social security;  and Central Office of Information and home publicity.    The chapters varied considerably in content:   some dealtwith policy;   some with presentation in the public expenditure White Paper;and some contained both kinds of recommendations.2. The attached response has been prepared by the Treasury and otherDepartments concerned;  and has been agreed at official level.    Since it ismade on behalf of several Departments, it is proposed to publish it as a white Paper.    Because of industrial action at the Stationery Office, a date for issuing the response cannot at present be arranged.    Subject toany comments from colleagues by close on Friday 6 October, I will arrange a date for issue as soon as the situation allows it.3. If the industrial action persists, it will if necessary be possible toissue the White Paper in typescript.    I will ensure that the Departmentsconcerned are notified of the date of issue when it has been arranged.J treasury Chambers2 October 1978
SELECTED PUBLIC EXPENDITUREPROGRAMMESOBSERVATIONS BY THE GOVERNMENT ON THE EIGHTH REPORT FROM THE EXPENDITURE COMMITTEE,SESSION 1977-78Production1-   In their Eighth Report of the 1977-78 Session, the Expenditure Committee made^commendations concerning a number of expenditure programmes in Part Two of the^test White Paper on the Governments expenditure plans (Cmnd 70^9).   The Govern-^at have given careful consideration to these recommendations.   The Governmentglad to note that in the Committee&apos;s view the exchanges between the Committeethe Government last year led to improvements in the White Paper.SiJPTERI: DEFENCE EXPENDITUREXt vould be prudent to revalidate the decisions (on the   Army Youth Teams and the^hdrawal of the Women&apos;s Royal Voluntary Service from Germany) in the light ofthe latest information about the extent of the underspend on Defence Votes andthe likelihood of its occurrence in future years (paragraph 10).2.The Government agree that, where the prospects for expenditure change after^isions on particular subjects are reached, it may be desirable to review thoseCl6ione to ensure that they remain valid.   However, where scope arises for^-lons to programmes, first priority must be given to measures which willl!QProve combat capability.^SSendationGovernment should make notes (relating to forecast expenditure in previous years)ln future White Papers more meaningful by including details of the major items**fected (paragraph 11).l%    The Government agree that it is desirable to make the notes to the White Paper* &quot;teaningful as possible, subject to security considerations and the avoidance
of excessive detail.   They will continue to be ready to respond by way of written andoral evidence to any further requests from the Committee for supplementary information on such matters.RecommendationConsideration should be given to the feasibility of making contingency arrangements with firms which would enable additional orders or new contracts to be placed at short notice (paragraph 12).4.     Contingency arrangements of the type proposed offer a welcome degree of flexiD1lity but are most likely to be practicable for products already available which can ^be diverted to the Ministry of Defence.   For much defence equipment capacity constrain ^limit the extent to which expenditure can be increased in the short time scales cono^h forThe Government will bear the Committee^ comments in mind in the continuing searcwgreater flexibility in the use of monies voted for defence.   They remain determineapply such monies as fully as possible to the maintenance of an effective defencecapability.RecommendationWe recommend that the Ministry should continue their efforts to be allowed to carryforward the amount of the cash limit underspent, where this has arisen throughcircumstances outside their control (paragraph 1*0.5. The Government note the views of the Committee. The Ministry of Defence andTreasury are continuing their examination of the problems.RecommendationConsideration should be given to increasing the cash limit to the extent that itdoes not cover the increased pay bill (paragraph 15).6. The Government are monitoring the progress of defence expenditure closely-No reductions have been made in defence expenditure programmes on account of theForces Pay Award.the
CHAPTER II:    REGIONAL AND SELECTIVE ASSISTANCE TO INDUSTRYGeneral&apos;*    The Government welcome the Committee&apos;s broad endorsement of the value of thePresent regional and selective assistance measures.   The Government concur, too, withtne Committee^ view that these incentives do not rival in importance appropriate&quot;lacro-economic measures, nor do they diminish the need for industry to improve its performance.^ figures for &quot;future industrial support&quot; should be a realistic estimate of whatf*other provision is expected to be needed, not merely for individual schemes whichCa* already be foreseen but in general terms to implement the policy of selective^assistance until a decision is taken to discontinue it.   We recommend that futurefi8ures should be presented on that basis (paragraph 7).8%    The Government accept the view underlying this recommendation that an overallProvision for regional and selective assistance based solely on the requirements of
existing measures and schemes and which declines over the White Paper period, can bemisleading.   It is for this reason that the programme of &quot;future industrial support  wintroduced in Crand 70**9 to indicate that further support was planned, and that thedecline was not as sharp as provision related only to existing programmes would sugge6It is difficult to make other than highly provisional estimates of futurerequirementsbut the new programme for future industrial support will be subjectilike other programmes, to annual review.RecommendationSave to the extent that the need can be clearly foreseen, we think it i6 probablybetter not to try to predict the unpredictable (future rescue cases ), but to omitsuch provision from the figures and to let the reader form his own judgement. 1*should, however, be clearly stated in the White Paper that this is being done:this year1s White Paper fails to do so (paragraph 9).9.   The Government agree and will make clear in future White Papers that no attempt is made to predict possible requirements for major future rescue cases.recommendations we welcome the Departments suggestion that they should make the results of the wool Textile and other studies available to the Sub-Committee (paragraph 16).of tneParliament needs, however, to be put in a position to assess the effectiveness o*programmes more accurately than has hitherto proved possible, and the results of current and continuing studies, and any other relevant information should be furnished to the Sub-Committee as they become available (paragraph 17).10.   Studies of the effectiveness of sectoral or other schemes of industrial supPd bwill take some time.   Many of the schemes, for example, have only recently close &apos;as   assessments are completed reports will be made to the Committee.
SSiSanis housing*   While this chapter contains no formal recommendations, it makes some observationsa response from the Government may be helpful.0n whichFirst, it is suggested in paragraph 3 that there is an inconsistency in the^aper over the level of housing improvement activity in the private sector1976.   This observation appears to be the result of misunderstanding, and anyfX.tcoming in the presentation of information which may have contributed to thate8ult is regretted.    Paragraph 11 on page 5** of Crand 70^9-11 and the accompanying^le on page 55 are concerned not just with improvements in the private sectorwlth improvements generally, ie for both the private and the public sectors.third sentence refers to the 1976 results, indicating an upturn in improvementv*ty which is illustrated in the final column of the table.   An increase is shownin thp- overall number of dwellings improved in the public and private sector as comparedlth 1975 (from 160,000 to 169,000).   As the Sub-Committee was informed in oralence, the comparable provisional figures for 1977 087,000) show that this improvement&quot;*s maintained.econdly, paragraph 9$ setting out the Committee&apos;s conclusions, refers to the^endations about the provision of additional information on housing which wereln the Committee&apos;s Ninth Report, Session 1976-77.   The Government welcome thectee&apos;s view that the provision of additional information in the housing chaptere Public expenditure White Paper on the lines it recommended has provedUa&amp;le and will continue to look for opportunities to improve the information givennd It.UB presentation.ne Housing Analysis and Monitoring Unit referred to in the Government&apos;s earlierJ nas now been established and the Government reaffirm their intention to publish.      Llnie to time material which will bring together relevant information about.     nS and update that in the Housing Green Paper and its supporting volume.^*    f ^lorm and timing of publication must depend on experience of when and int form relevant material can be produced - a period of experiment and evolutionu   0 be expected. Work has now been put in hand.   This materialsupersede or duplicate other Departmental publications, for example Housinginstruction Statistics, which already provide much valuable information onln8 policy and progress.
15. In August 1978 the Scottish Development Department published the first edition ofa new statistical and information series,  &apos;Scottish Housing Statistics&apos;, which is designed to bring together in a convenient form the basic information about Scottishhousing which is needed for constructive debate on policy.16. The Government will continue to keep under review the extent to which furtherinformation about housing progress attributable to previous years&apos; expendituremight usefully be provided in the public expenditure White Paper.    On the question 0forecasting progress to be achieved by proposed expenditure, the Government pointedout in their previous reply that detailed projections would not be practicable, sinceunder the new Housing Investment Programme (HIP) and Housing Plan systems the preci5eallocation of resources and objectives depends ultimately on the decisions which loC8housing authorities take in the exercise of their power to switch expenditure betweenprogrammes within defined limits.   For this reason the White Paper showsexpenditurefigures for future years in blocks. It remains the Government&apos;s intentionto give further consideration to this question as more experience is gained of thesystem of capital allocations.17. Thirdly, the Government have taken careful note of the Committee&apos;s views on theoperation of the HIP system and will give them full consideration in the futured development of the system.CHAPTER IV:    PROVISION FOR MUSEUMS, GALLERIES AND LIBRARIESRecommendationThe Department of Education and Science should consider carefully the relevant c0made to the Sub-Committee in evidence, and provide more detail, in particular to distinguish territorially between the recipients of funds (paragraph 6).18. As was stated in evidence, the Department already makes available each year*particularly to the Library Association, detailed information about the programmefunding summarised in programme Chapter 10 of the White Paper, showing separatesfunding of the relevant central and local government services in England and^a^e6Consideration will&apos; be given to including at least some of the details in the white paper in future.recommendation the DES should set up a Committee to examine as a matter of urgency the whole .g$relationship between the Department, national, public,university and other lib1&quot;and library advisory councils (paragraph 15).
19.   It is the function of the two Library Advisory Councils set up under the PublicLibraries and Museums Act 19M to advise the Secretary of State for Education and science and the Secretary of State for Wales not only on their functions in relationto the public library system but also on any other library question.   The Secretaryof State for Education and Science looks to the Library Advisory Council for England,*hose membership includes people from all library fields, for independent advice ontl*e relationship between the national library, the local authority public libraries,the university libraries and other libraries.   The Council have recently, at thesuggestion of the Department, embarked on a comprehensive study of long-termdevelopments affecting all parts of the library system, including questions of organisation and the relations between the different parts of the system. TheDepartment will bring to the attention of the Council the evidence given to theExpenditure Committee when it is published.^ commendation^e Library Advisers in the Department of Education and Science should be givengreater status and influence (paragraph 15).^   The standing and influence of the Library Advisers is derived to a very greate*tent from their own experience and personal qualities.   Since their posts wereCfeated in 19M they have had a Civil Service status equivalent to that of Principal;tne Senior Library Adviser has an additional allowance, which will be shown in theCivtt Service Year Book in future.   Their grading has been determined by the level oftheir responsibilities in relation to those of other grades in the Civil Service.Inrecent years it has become difficult, as a result of developments in salaries^ career prospects in the local library service, to recruit Advisers with widee*Perience at senior level.   The Government will keep the situation under review.-e^ommendationSent consideration should be given to the effect of the anomaly over the levyVATOf*at on the export of works of art, and to the removal of discrimination againstrchasers in this country (paragraph 25).VAT is a broadly based tax on consumer expenditure.   Reliefs are strictlymited and are confined for the most part to items of expenditure which arelDlPortant in family budgets.   But even among these by no means all are relieved.ASsirist this background it would be difficult to justify relief from the taxWorks of art.   Moreover it would inevitably lead to pressure for similar reliefother goods and services in the
cultural, leisure, sport and entertainment fields, and even more widely still, with thcstrong possibility of a substantial loss of revenue; this would have to be made upeither by increasing the rates of tax, or by taxing some of th^ goods and services which are at present relieved.   As for the possibility of zero rating supplies topurchaser^in this country, this is excluded under the e.c. Sixth Directive on VAT, which prevents Member States from introducing new zero-ratings on any significant scale.22. As regards exports, it is a normal rule with taxes on consumption such as VAT tn*they should apply to goods traded within the jurisdiction of the tax authority and notsupplies of goods for export.    Exported items will normally be charged at the rateprevailing on import to the country to which they are exported.   The contrast betweensupplies for domestic use and relief for exports is thus not an anomaly, but a basicprinciple of the indirect tax system.    Relief for exports similarly applies in all member States of the e.c., and is also a basic requirement of the e.c. Sixth Directive*23. The increases made in the purchase grants of the national museums and gallerie5(and the central Government special funds for assisting local museums1 purchases)* de**^from 1973 took account of the increased prices of works of art because of the inciof VAT.    In practice however the incidence of the tax on the price of works of artof museum quality is generally quite small because if works of art are purchased fr0a dealer under the special second-hand scheme tax is only levied on the dealer&apos;smargin.    If they are bought at auction tax is only chargeable on the auctioneer1^commission, provided that the seller is not a registered VAT trader.2h.   The Government agree with the House of Lords Select Committee on the Europeanto tb*Communities which commented in its 31st Report (paragraph 16) that the solutionproblem must be sought elsewhere than in pressing for amendment of VAT law.RecommendationThere should urgently be a review of the problem of divided   responsibility for 0f&quot;rescue archaeology&quot; between the Department of the Environment and the DepartmenEducation and Science with a view to establishing clear-cut responsibilities (pa25).-25.   The responsibilities of the two Departments are already clear.   The DOE giveSgrants on a selective basis towards expenditure on   rescue   archaeology, that *6investigation of threatened sites, the examination of finds and the publication 0 .treports.   The DES has no direct responsibility in this field.   Some museums pardirectly in excavating and some accept site records and finds for storage.   Whi^e tDES finances national museums directly and contributes to other museums indirecfor each museum to decide in the light of the resources available to it and thevarious demands upon those resources   what contribution it should make to the
archaeological work described above.   Neither Department accepts a general responsibility for the storage of archaeological material or endorses the view heldb* some archaeologists, and quoted by the Committee, that all excavated material8*ould be preserved indefinitely.   Many finds need some   conservation   to prepare^em for examination and storage.   Such work is undertaken by the Ancient MonumentsOratory of the DOE not only on finds from sites in the Departments care but^so to some extent on finds from   rescue   sites.   In the past year the DOE has provided contributions on a   pilot   basis, in two museum areas, towardsth* conservation of certain finds from rescue sites which have been accepted bylocal museums.CHAPTER V;    1978 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE WHITE PAPER CHAPTERS 11 AND 123$*jth and personal social servicesRegional health authorities should have the right to switch a higher proportiontheir allocations from revenue to capital (paragraph k).*   The Government accept that there may be occasions which require greater flexi-^ity between revenue and capital allocations within the health programme than the**esent limits provide.   Regional health authorities have been informed that the^department will consider specific proposals from any region which foresees either a* to switch a higher proportion of their allocation between revenue and capital0r for a strategic shift of resources over a number of years.^SSfrendation.^ntinued effort should be devoted to the task of producing a meaningful analysis of6 Unit costs of treating patients and personal social services clients (paragraph 6).$7, ^-The Government accept this recommendation.^ggSendation^ fJHSS should follow up their analysis of unit costs for residents in home6^ by local authorities and for those supported by local authorities, in homesother organisations, in order to draw conclusions from comparative costs***graPh 8).A&apos;    to      meaningful comparison of costs must take account of the financial arrangementsjn^rUnning the voluntary homes and also of the levels of dependency of their residents,th C***on6 are that residents in voluntary homes are generally less dependent than^n local authority homes.   The Government will look into the possibility ofaimXn6 further information from additional analyses of existing data.   In the light^t they will consider whether a fresh study i6 worthwhile.9
Social SecurityRecommendationThe Department should review the policies underlying the calculations for the upratingallowance, and provide Parliament with an analysis of alternative policy options(paragraph 1*0.29-   Current uprating policies are based on the present statutory provisions. TneGovernment agree that the policies should be reviewed and will consider how best tobring before Parliament in due course an analysis of alternative policy options.recommendation for &amp;The Government should publish as soon as possible a full analysis of the reasonslarge rise in invalidity benefit shown in the latest White Paper (paragraph 16)*30. The rising trend in expenditure on invalidity benefit is already under examinain the Department of Health and Social Security who will make known their finding6the reasons as soon as the necessary enquiries have been completed.recommendation the Government should in future supply Parliament with the assumptions about futurelevels of unemployment and the expected growth in real earnings on which the social security expenditure figures are based (paragraph 18).31. The Government will provide this information in the next public expenditurePaper.RecommendationIt .is essential for Parliament to be informed of the total cost of unemploymentsocial security programme and not just that proportion of it which falls underheading of unemployment benefit..The White Paper figures should be supplemented by a presentation of expenditureclient groups.   As a minimum, the figures for supplementary benefit should be ,disaggregated to show spending on the elderly, the unemployed and other client(paragraphs 19 and 20).32. With the exception of supplementary benefit, which is a general incomemaintenance benefit, the contributory and non-contributory benefits in the eoC^^&apos;security programme can at present be identified as relating to the aged, thethe sick, the unemployed etc.   As requested, however, a supplementary table **

CHAPTER VI:    CENTRAL OFFICE OF INFORMATION AND HOME PUBLICITYRecommendation^he common services the COI provides for Government departments should be0n repayment terras (paragraph 12).The Government have said in response to the Committee1s Eleventh Reportthat they intend to review a6 necessary, for common services individually,tfte balance of advantage in charging user Departments.   The Government arenot persuaded that in the case of the COI a change from the present system^allied services would be beneficial administratively or cost-effective,they will review the case further in the light of the Committee1s^cific recommendation.RecommendationA*y Department should be free, subject to the permission of the Civil ServiceApartment, to place its advertising directly.   The Advisory Committee shouldMonitor such placings for three years and report its findings.   It should^eo assess the results of the National Savings Committee&apos;s present policy of placing advertisements directly (paragraph 13).This recommendation  is inconsistent with the Departments commonaervice role and would go against the trends of recent years to centralise,0r* the advice of the Advisory Committee on Advertising, purchasing and creativeand management of Government advertising in order to achieve economies in funds and staff.   The Government believe   that the balance of advantage^es in maintaining responsibility for all the expertise involved in thisfi*ld with a common service department.   ACA   is already studying the National^vings Departments policy of direct     buying of its advertising and theApartment has provided information for this purpose.
recommendation the composition of the Advisory Committee on Advertising should be alteredso that people with experience of buying advertising constitute a majorityof the Committee (paragraph 15)*36. The recommendation that people with experience of buying advertisingshould form a majority of ACA is accepted.   The present constitution ofthe Committee fulfills this requirement. The Government thinkthat ACA should also include persons with experience of the media:the two objectives are reconcilable.RecommendationA code of practice should be drawn up by the COI and the broadcasting authorities to clarify the arrangements for transmission of government publicity on radio and television (paragraph 18).37. There is already a de facto code of practice.   Fillers are produced for both television and radio;   the same material is made available to theIndependent Broadcasting Companies and the BBC.   Subjects acceptable for f*eetransmission are restricted to those falling within the broad headings ofhealth, safety and welfare.   However, the suggestion for a fresh examinationof this scheme is accepted.   The Central Office of Information will start tal^6with the broadcasting authorities.Recommendation.The selection board to recommend the appointment of a Department&apos;s ChiefInformation Officer should always contain a majority of officers from theDepartment concerned and the board should consult the Departmental Ministerduring the selection process (paragraph 20).38o   The Committee&apos;s recommendation is accepted as a general principle.
