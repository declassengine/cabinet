CP(78) 86 COPY NO31 July 1978CABINET80BRITISH NATIONAL OIL CORPORATION EXEMPTION FROMPETROLEUM REVENUE TAXMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. This paper sets out why in my view we should, as part of the petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) package we are now contemplating, withdraw the British National Oil Corporation^ (BNOCs) exemption.    This was themajority view in the Ministerial Group on United Kingdom-United StatesDouble Taxation Treaty (GEN 137) and there are a number of sound reasonsfor so doing.2. First, the background.    The original decision to exempt BNOC wastaken at a time when it was envisaged that PRT would be relieved forlicensees who accepted participation.    This decision was not subsequentlyreviewed despite radical changes in the participation arrangements until theCommittee Stage of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Act, by which time it had become an entrenched provision on which we were then unwilling to make what would at the time have been seen as a major concession. Infact the arguments in favour of the exemption had by then already become very thin and the remaining ones - that we should not prejudice BNOCschances of breaking even at an early date, or risk it reaching its borrowinglimits sooner than might otherwise be the case - are no longer valid given theCorporation18 healthy financial position.3. Second, there is no doubt that the situation is irritating to the oil companies, and it worries them because they suspect that despite assurances given by Ministers BNOC may in the past have taken, and even more so mayin the future take, an unfair advantage of their exemption.    Clearly theincrease in rates which we propose would accentuate this.    The deviceadopted at present of annotating the Corporation&apos;s accounts is not an effective one, and does not in fact enable one to see the position that wouldhave obtained had the Corporation paid tax.4. Third, as an extension of the point about removing suspicions of unfair competition, I understand that BNOC themselves would be content to see theirexemption go.
5. Fourth, it is not quite true to say that removal of the exemptionwould make no difference to Government revenue overall.    It would in factgive us a small gain because at present excessive reliefs can in some circumstances be achieved by companies who are in partnership with BNOC.6. I do not think that a removal of BNOCs exemption would necessarilyundermine its wider national role.    It will still remain, in accordance withthe statute, the Governments adviser on oil matters.    It is, of course,already liable to corporation tax, and this does not affect its wider nationalrole;  nor should liability to PRT.7. Finally, and most important, I think that removal of the exemptionnow is very desirable if we are to get anything like a smooth passage for our proposals as to the change in regime.    What we are discussing are bigchanges, but in my view necessary if we are to receive the right public/private balance of benefit from the North Sea.    In my view Parliament andthe public - with the natural exception of the oil companies themselves - will see them as fair.    But if we continue the BNOC exemption we leave a sharppeg which the oil companies will certainly capitalise on and which could allowour proposals to be attacked in a way which would certainly not be helpful tous.8. To summarise, whatever the situation when the exemption was granted, there are now sound arguments on merits for withdrawing BNOCsexemption from PRT.    In addition, to continue the exemption while we seek to change the regime as we propose could jeopardise those changes, and atthe least could lead them to be presented in an unhelpful light.    This was theview of a large majority of us in GEN 137 and I think we should stick to it.J treasury Chambers28 July 19782
