CP(78) 87 COPY NO 0U31 July 1978CABINETBRITISH NATIONAL OIL CORPORATION EXEMPTION FROMPETROLEUM REVENUE TAXMemorandum by the Secretary of State for EnergyINTRODUCTION1. The original decision to exempt the British National Oil Corporation(BNOC) from the Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) was taken before the petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Bill had reached its Committee stage andalthough the proposal was fought hard by the Opposition, Ministers were unwilling to make what would have been a major concession.2. Exemption was defended on the grounds that the whole of BNOCsrevenue would flow to the National Oil Account from which any surplus maybe transferred to the Consolidated Fund.    It was therefore not necessary to collect PRT separately.3. Although opposition was substantial no amendments were made. Butassurances were given in Committee that BNOC would behave commerciallywhile, as a result of an undertaking given in the Lords, the requirement thatBNOC should show in its annual report and accounts the PRT they would have paid had they been liable, was given statutory form.ENDING OF THE EXEMPTION4. Ending BNOCs exemption would neither increase Government revenuenor prevent BNOC making a profit.    The case for doing so is partly that theoriginal justification for it, which was concerned with our participationpolicy, has disappeared and more importantly that it irritates the oil companies and that changes in the fiscal regime would be more palatable ifthis concession were made.    BNOC themselves believe that withdrawal ofthe exemption would improve their commercial standing by indicating thatthey were not going to retain an apparently privileged position.1
5. However there are several arguments against ending the exemption.First we must expect and stand up to criticism of BNOC from those whoseinterests cannot always be expected to coincide with our own; this criticism will not be silenced by the futile exercise of collecting PRT fromthe Corporation.    Secondly it would emphasise BNOCs commercial role asagainst its national role; this would be wrong when we have alwaysrecognised that the Corporation will have a special role to play in thedevelopment of the United kingdom s offshore oil and gas resources. Thirdlyand most importantly, BNOCs exemption was forced through againstsubstantial opposition.    To retreat now would indicate a weakness on theGovernments part and an admission that we had been wrong would be highlyembarrassing.conclusion. I consider that the advantage lies in retaining BNOCs exemption from PRT and I invite my colleagues to endorse this.A W BDepartment of Energy31 July 19782
