CP(78) 93 COPY NO26 September 1978CABINETZAMBIAMemorandum by the Prime Minister1. The Cabinet will wish to know the outcome of my talks withKenneth Kaunda, which were held urgently at his request on22-23 September, at Kano in Nigeria.2. The President was profoundly worried about possible developmentswithin and around Rhodesia and about the implications for the integrity and security of Zambia.    He feared that an intensification of the guerilla war would soon provoke a fierce retaliatory attack by the Smith regime not onlyon the guerilla bases operating from within the Zambian borders but upon theheartland of Zambia itself, including Lusaka.    Apart from his concern atthe prospective loss of life in that event, he foresaw irresistible pressure to enlist military support from outside Zambia, which would lead to an all-outwar.    Concurrently, he is beset by economic problems:  the Zambianeconomy is unbalanced, and too dependent upon the copper mining industry,which is suffering both from the fall in the world price of copper and fromthe dislocation of transport which prevents its export.    The international monetary Fund assessment is that the economy can scarcely be brought back into balance in less than a year: in the meantime, a shortage of foreign exchange is such that there is a real risk that fertilisers and seed necessaryfor the maize planting in October/November cannot be brought into thecountry.    The President said that he would have to take early decisions aboutnis future course of action and asked whether the Western powers had any proposals for an immediate initiative.    Our own sources of information, andthe briefing by our High Commissioner to Zambia, supported the view thatthe situation is critical.3* The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and I had several hours ofdiscussion with President Kaunda from which we concluded that it was right for the United Kingdom Government to offer immediate support to the resident and the Zambian people - politically, economically and by way of*nilitary equipment and training.    We also judged that it was right to maketnis offer there and then, notwithstanding that there had been no time to consult the Cabinet.    The heart of the matter is, of course, the Rhodesian1
situation and we agreed with President Kaunda that the situation made itnecessary to convene as soon as possible - and no later than October - anAH-Party Conference (APC) for the purpose of implementing the Anglo-American Proposals (AAP).    We judged that the risk of failure wasoutweighed by the inevitable consequences of a rapidly escalating war.We also agreed that in the event of failure, whether because some of those concerned would not come or because agreement proved unattainable, theright course would be to proceed immediately to the Security Council of theUnited Nations and there seek endorsement of the AAP for a settlement ofthe Rhodesian situation which the international community would support.4. We also agreed to support Zambia at this time with military andeconomic assistance.    We have promised that the Overseas Military Adviser(General Fursdon) should go to Zambia urgently to assess what is requiredto bring the Zambian defences, and in particular the air defence of Lusaka,up to standard;  and we have offered to consider, in the light ofGeneral Fursdon&apos;s report, what advice, training and hardware could beprovided to make good immediate deficiencies.5. On the economic front, we have undertaken to proceed as quickly aswe can to help with the restoration of the railway system through Zairewhich has already begun.    This is necessary to renew Zambian exports of copper via the West coast.    The Minister of State for Overseas Developmentbad also begun diccuscions some time ago with a view to offering additional aid and I was authorised to make a further offer of  20 million.    In theaftermath of the Bingham Report, this did not seem an appropriate time todo so.    As an alternative and in order to deal with Zambia&apos;o immediateforeign exchange problem we undertook that the United Kingdom Governmentwould finance the immediatepur chase of  20 million of Zambian copper stocks at current prices, for delivery at a forward date to be arranged.6. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Secretary of State for defence, and the Minister for Overseas Development, will pursue thesernatters, in consultation with the Departments principally concerned, and Ihave asked that they should bring their detailed proposals forward urgentlyfor consideration by the appropriate Committees of Ministers.7* The detailed working out of these arrangements will take a little timeand I have agreed with President Kaunda that, in the meantime, we shoulddisclose no more than that we had discussed the problems of Southern africa as a whole and further contact would be made to deal with particular issues.8. I invite my colleagues to support the action which we have taken.I will add orally to this account at Cabinet.LJC10 Downing Street26 September 19782
