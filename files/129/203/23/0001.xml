I        CP(78) 98 COPY NO $O9 October 1978CABINETRHODESIAN SANCTIONS:  FURTHER INQUIRYNote by the Prime Minister1. At the end of our discussion on 28 September (CM(78) 33rd Conclusions,Minute 4) the Secretary of the Cabinet was instructed to prepare a draft white paper including a factual summary of the contents of the Bingham Report; a section on the wider background to the sanctions policy;  and a discussion ofthe possible forms of a further inquiry, including their l^gal implications.2. I attach this draft herewith.    I suggest that on 12 October the cabinet should concentrate on three questions:-a. Having seen the sort of thing that can be produced, do they still favour a White Paper?b. Do they still favour the idea of having a section on the widerbackground to the sanctions policy?c. Do they wish to give any guidance for further redrafting?LJC10 Downing Street9 October 1978
(confidential)introduction the origins of the current public debate on the supply of petroleum and petroleum products to Rhodesia lie in the decision of the Government, inApril 1977i to establish an independent inquiry into these matters, and inthe finding of that inquiry.2. The Report on the Supply of Petroleum and Petroleum products to rhodesia, by Mr T H Bingham, QC, and Mr S LI Gray, important, was published bythe Foreign and Commonwealth Office on 19 September 1973.   For conveniencehowever the conclusions of that report are reproduced in Part I of this white Paper with the addition only of certain explanatory footnotes.3. The Bingham report emphasised that in telling their story its authorsdid not attempt to relate it to contemporaneous political, diplomatic andeconomic events because these were outside their terms of reference. they recognised however that any judgment upon the story requires close attentionto the context in which it occurred.   Part 2 of this White Paper thereforecontains a brief account of events affecting Rhodesia, and in particular the question of oil sanctions, from 1964 onwards.4. Part 3 deals with the next steps and the form of any further inquiry.f
part 1CONCLUSIONS14.1 In this Chapter we summarise our main Tactual conclusions t ve summariseand review the major arguments advanced on behalf of the Shell and 3P Groups andve make certain concluding observations.14.2 Ve refrain from expressing any opinion as to whether any company orany individual has or may have at any time committed any criminal offence underthe Sanctions Orders.   Our Terms of Reference do not in our opinion permit,/not publishedjstill less require, us to do so.   We have, however, in Annex HI,/gatheredtogether information and references which may be of relevance in considering whether criminal offences have been committed:   the information a&quot;d referencesthere given relate to the more important companies which feature either in theorganisation charts referred to in Chapter I, paragraph 1.45 or in the chain of supply to Southern Africa described in Chapter I, Section C.A.     FACTUAL CONCLUSIONS14. ^     It is convenient that we should summarise our main conclusions * In&quot;I.r.a. rig this summary ve would emphasise(a) that a proper understanding and fair appreciation of the factssummarised require reference to the indicated passages in thefull text.(b) that the summary is of facts now known:   many of the facts nowsummarised were not contemporaneously known to one or otheror both of the Groups in London;   some were not known untilthe relevant documents were assembled from many sources for presentation to us;   same came to light in the course of the investigation.   It would be wrong to assume that all the eventsnow summarised were known to the Groups in London at the timethe event8 were taking place.Our ma in conclusions are these:(i)   Shell notified the Rhodesian Government before UDI tnat the
Shall and 3? Groups would continue to perform their contractual obligations3Qleas or until force majeure prevented them doing so.   There may have beenformal expressions of opinion to the effect that sanctions were unlikely to be* iapoaed and, if imposed, were unlikely to be effective.   The Groups didaot deliberately encourage the Rhodeaian Government to make ita illegal declar-*tion of independence and did not assure that Government that it would maintain^PPliea if sanctions were imposed. (Chapter IV, paragraphs 4-3 - 4-16).(ii) it seems very likely that in the weeks preceding promulgation of1965 Sanctions Order stocks in Rhodesia rose above the normal level. We40 not think that any major concerted effort to that end was made, and limita-^iona on storage capacity precluded substantial stockpiling.   We doubt if the^Sin by which stocks were increased significantly affected the subsequentCo^ae of events-(Chapter IV, paragraphs 4-17 - 4.23).(iii) It appears that stocks of refined producta in Zambia immediately^or to the 1965 Sanctions Order were at a very low level.   It may be that***** vaa some interception in Rhodesia of supplies intended for Zambia, or* deliberate failure to consign to Zambia supplies which would otherwise have**** consigned, but the evidence available to ua doea not show that this was,0* (Chapter 17, paragraphs 4.24 - 4-28).(iv) We are satisfied that Shell did not, in the weeks immediatelyCeding the 1965 Sanctions Order, negotiate with the Portuguese to vary thetQ** of documentation for imports in transit through Mozambique with a view tobaling the destination of producta consigned to Bhodesia in the event of^argo. (Chapter IV, paragraphs 4-29 - 4-33).(v) Upon the mating of the 1965 Sanctions Order Shell on behalf of^UdaW ^ad the Shell and BP Groups acted promptly to notify the Consolid-companies in South Africa, Mozambique and Bhodeaia of the terms of the* and to seek the compliance of those companies with its terms.     A cargoC:*ilcn the high seas en route for Hhodesia was diverted.   Farther suppliesOfC?tlQ3 were stopped.   Orders suspected of being for Rhodesia were rejected.pt*r V, paragraphs 5-2-5.5 and 5-43J.s*e:(l* A vfolding company jointly owned by bp and Shell in equal shares, which managedeU/bp marketing companies in South Africa.

No crude oil has reachedthe Refinery since that date and it remains closed down. (Chapter 17,paragraph 4.22 and Chapter 7t paragraphs 5.49 and 5.74).(vii) The Consolidated management immediately stopped the despatch of products from the Durban Refinery and the Luboil Blending Plant and (after apause to aaaess the legal position) acted to prevent the supply from SouthAfrica to Rhodesia of products which had traditionally been supplied from the consolidated companies in South Africa to their affiliates in Rhodesia.(Chapter V, paragraphs 5-3t 5-8t 5-23 and 5-25).(viii) Oil products began to reach Rhodesia by the road route overBeit Bridge at a rate rising from about 35, OCO gallons per day in February upto about 100,000 gallons per day in May 196c.   Subsequently the quantitiesentering Rhodesia by this route declined.   Supplies were sent partly by SouthAfrican supporters of the Rhodeaian regime and partly by South African andRhodeaian contractors, and were increasingly obtained by GEJTA (the Shodesianoil procurement agency).     Transport belonging to the South African Consolid-ated marketing companies was not involved.   Some transport   belonging or leasedto Rhodeaian contractors but painted (or previously painted) with the coloursof the Shodesian Consolidated companies waa used to obtain supplies;   some ofthese companies1 own transport may also have been used.   It is certainlyPossible, though not proved, that the Rhodesian Consolidated companies activelyParticipated in the procurement of supplies by road from the Transvaal.Another Rhodesian marketing company did so.   The source of the productscarried to Rhodesia by road cannot be clearly ascertained, but it ia likelytaat they derived from al3 the South African marketing companies. (Chapter V,Section C^(is)     The local management of the Consolidated companies in SouthAfrica waa impeded in its initial efforts to restrict the flow of oil to rhodesia by the insistence of the-South African Government that there should^ ootnote:(2)    Rhodesia&apos;s only refinery at Umtali.
k** no embargo within South Africa, on supplies to Rhodesia and by the strongPro-rhodesian sympathy of virtually &quot;all white South Africans employed by thecompanies.   Despite these impedimenta the local management of Consolidated triedspring about the first six months or so after the 19^5 Sanctions Order toprevent or reduce the flow of oil to Hhodesia. (Chapter V,Section D).(ac)   In February 1966 oil producta began to be carried by rail from south Africa via Mozambique to Bhodeaia.   This traffic reached a peak in May^966 and thereafter declined, ceasing altogether in March 1967.   The quantityQ  all products carried by this route during i960 amounted to some 87,000 tons.*t seems highly probable that industrial customers of all the South AfricanMarketing companies bought rail tank cars of product surplus to their require-5en-a and re-consigned them to Rhodesia.   It seems clear that Parry Leon and^^yhoe Limited bought rail tank cars of product and re-consigned them to^nodesia.   The figures suggest that a substantial proportion of this trafficCQQsiated of purchases by Parry Leon and Hayhoe from the Consolidated marketers*^ South Africa, and that some members of the South African management must have^^ovn of the destination of   these products.     (Chapter VII, paragraphs 7-2 - 7*57.60 - 7.62).(zi)   In December 1966 Shell Mocambique delivered about 3,000 tons of products free on rail at Lourenco Marques to Parry Leon and Hayhoe pursuant&quot;Q contracts made between Shell South Africa and Parry Leon and Hayhoe In^channesburg.   &quot;nwrt^g 1967 about 150,000 tons were so delivered.   Shell South^*ica was under strong pressure from the South African Government, if notlegal obligation, to make sales to South African buyers able to pay the^-ce,which is what Parry Leon and Hayhoe were.   While the product probably****3ed technically through the ownership of Shell -Mocambique, it was supplied^ the Consolidated marketing companies in South Africa and was in the main^^Ported to Mozambique from South Africa.   Parry Leon and Hayhoe sold these^cucts to GE2JTA and consigned them to Rhodesia.   Additional quantities mayVe^l have been similarly delivered to Parry Leon and Hayhoe for carriage to-4-^ootnote:^   A British-registered company jointly owned by Shell and BP.
the Transvaal. (Chapter I, paragraph 1.71, Chapter III, paragraphs 3-3 - 3.5,Chapter 7, paragraphs 5.28 and 5.81 and Chapter VII, paragraphs 7.18, 7.37(ii)and (iv), 7.39, 7-58 and 7-59(ii)).- (4)(xii)   When Mr. Yasconcellos in Mozambique appreciated that goods deliver-ered to Parry Leon and Hayhoe, or some of them, were being carried to Rhodesiahe raised the matter with the top management in South Africa.   He vas told(in effect) to continue making such deliveries.     The management in South Africavas however concerned to avoid the affixing of rail tank car labels showing aHhodeaian destination within the Shell Mocambique installation and was insist-ant that no consignments were to be made direct to Hhodeeian destinations.(Chapter VII, paragraphs 7.29, 7*30, 7.33 and 7*36).(xLii)   Mr. Walker&apos;s personal position as a South African citizen andGeneral Manager in South Africa with overall local responsibility for Mozambiquewas a difficult one because he could not faithfully comply at the same timeboth with the policy of the 1965 Sanctions Order that supplies should be denied to Rhodesia and with the policy of the South African Government that SouthAfrican traders should be free to trade with Rhodesia.   He believed it was arguable that since neither he nor Shell Mocambique knew for sure that anyparticular consignment was destined for Rhodesia there was no contravention of the 1965 Sanctions Order.   (Chapter 711, paragraphs 7.25 and 7.37(v)).(xiv) Mr. Walker informed the British Embassy in South Africa of his view that oil for Rhodesia was going through various intermediaries from allthe companies supplying South Africa, probably in about the same proportion as their share of the South African market, and that he believed the other companies would make good any shortfall in supplies made by the Consolidatedmarketing companies.   (Chapter VII, paragraph 7.58(iii)).(xv) Until January 1968 the Shell and BP Groups in London believedthat no sales were made by the Consolidated marketing companies in South africa and Mozambique to customers who were known or thought to be selling the productson to Rhodeaia.   That belief was based on information and assurances given bythe General Manager in South Africa, Mr. Walker.   These assurances were passed-5-Footnote:(4)    Then Sales Manager of Shell Mocambique.
on-    HMG which, until towards the close of 1967. fully accepted them.(Chapter VI, paragraphs 6.31 - 6.33. 6.35 and 6.39).(xvi) From about May 1966, when&apos;the scale of the supply to Rhodesiabecame known, EMC was very much concerned to stop that supply.   During 1967a number of schemes were explored and diplomatic moves made to that end. HMGoame to believe that without the co-operation of South Africa and Portugal,and in the absence of a restricted crude supply by the CFP Group5io theSQHaRSP Refinery,6 ^the supply to Rhodesia could not (without an embargo on&quot;^PPlies to South Africa and Mozambique) be stopped altogether.   The attentionof EKG was then concentrated on achieving a position in which it could trulyb* laid that British companies were not engaged in supplying Rhodesia and that110 British oil was reaching Rhodesia.     Towards the end of 1967 HMG began to8u*P*ct that customers to whom goods were delivered free on rail at LourencoM**qaea by Shell Mocambique were consigning them to Rhodesia.   (Chapter 71,^^grapha 6.7 - 6.10,6.15 - 6.30. 6.39 and 6.72).(xvii) Information given to Shell in London in January 1968 led theto believe that Parry Leon and Eayhoe, to whom goods were delivered***e on rail at Lourenco Marques, might be consigning them to Rhodesia. A*i paid to South Africa and Mozambique by representatives of Shell in^on confirmed that belief.   (Chapter VI, paragraphs 6.42 - 6.52 and 6.55).(xviii) In about February 1968 Shell South Africa made an arrangementTotal South Africa that orders for products to be delivered free on rail* Wrenco Marques, placed on Shell South Africa by customers suspected of^^iag on to Rhodesia, should be fulfilled with product supplied by Total^ Africa from its Matola installation^ exchange for an equivalent quan-Ut* of product supplied to it by the Consolidated companies in South Africa* * convenient point or points in that country.   (Chapter VI, paragraph 6.59^ ^pter Till, paragraphs 8.2, 8.6 and 8.7).(xix) On the 21st February 1968 representatives of the Groups dia-^ to the Commonwealth Secretary that deliveries had in the past been made^ on rail at Lourenco Marques to customers who had re-sold to Rhodesia and-6-^ote.:Compagnie Francaise des Petroles. the parent company of the Total Group.fMozambique1 s only refinery.^ear Lourenco Marques. ,
that arrangements had been made for orders placed hy suspicious customershenceforward to be met from.non-British sources at Lourenco Marques.   It mayhave been indicated that the CFP Group was the most likely non-British sourceand that a product exchange was involved.   The details of the Total exchangearrangement were communicated to HMG in the course of the following year if noton that occasion.   HMG considered that this was the best arrangement which couldbe made in the circumstances but realised that it would not of itself prevent or reduce the quantity of oil reaching Rhodesia.    (Chapter 71, paragraphs 6.75*6.76, 6.80 and 6.83).(xx) The Total exchange arrangement was implemented and operated fora period, *rr*Hwg which orders placed on Shell South Africa by Parry Leon andHayhoe and (after 1569) Freight Services were physically met with product sup-plied and handled by Total South Africa at Lourenco Marques against an equiva-lent supply elsewhere.   This arrangement was superseded by an arrangement underwhich products supplied by the Consolidated South African marketing companies were handled through the Total installation at Lourenco Marques for a fee andthen delivered by Total to Freight Services.   This arrangement with Total endedat about the end of 1971.   (Chapter VIII., paragraphs 8.3 - 8.12).(xxi) After the ending of the arrangements with Total orders placed byFreight Services an Shell South Africa were met from products supplied by the consolidated South African marketing companies and delivered by Shell Mocam-bique at Lourenco Marques.   Most if not all of these products were consignedby Freight Services to Rhodesia. (Chapter 711, paragraph 7.37(ii) and ChapterVIH, paragraphs 8.16 and 8.23 - 8.25).(xxii) It was known to the top management of the Consolidated companiesii South Africa and (after the event) Mozambique that the arrangements withTotal South Africa       come to an end.   It was known to the top management in both countries that deliveries to Freight Services at Lourenco Marques werehandled by Shell Mocambique. (Chapter Till, paragraphs 8.12, 8.13 and 8.29).(xxiii) During visits to South Africa in early 1974 it came to theattention of Mr. Francis (Shell) and Mr. Sandford (BP) that the Total exchangearrangement        ended        that Shell Mocambique was hand! ing deliveries to
freight Services.   Mr. Francis told the local management of SERVTCOor Shellfcuuth Africa, that steps should be taken at once to remove Shell Mocambiquefrom the chain of supply to Freight Services.   This waa not done before the closure of the Mozambique/Rhodesia border in March 1976, although the quanti-ties delivered by Shell Mocambique to Freight Services diminished following the opening of a direct rail link between South Africa and Rhodesia inSeptember 1974.   Mr. Francia discussed the matter with his immediate superiorMr. de Liefde and thought that he had effectively communicated an unstanding of the problem.   Such was not the case:   Mr. de Liefde did not appreciate thatShell Mocambique might be in jeopardy nor that there waa any departure from*3aangement8 notified to EMG.    Mr. Francis did not make any report on thisaatter to any other member of the Shell management nor ascertain whether his instructions to SERYICO or Shall South Africa had been carried out, althoughwaa led to believe for a time that Freight Services traffic to Rhodesia hadswitched from Lourenco Marques to the new rail link.   Early in 1975 he learned that some Freight Services supplies to Rhodesia were still being handled byShell Mocambique in Lourenco Marques but thought that these were minor residual^Uveriea which gradually petered out.   Mr. Sandford informed his immediateVerier Mr. Robertson what he had learned in South Africa and of the concerntijat he felt about it, but Mr. Robertaon knew very little of the eventa in 1968*ad misconceived the status of Freight Services and did not communicate anya*one of urgency or to the moat senior levels of BP management or toShell.   Mr. Sandford pursued the matter with Mr. Francis but in October 1974CQacluded (wrongly) that the new rail link had attracted the Lourenco Marques0U traffic and thus solved the problem.   Thereafter he did nothing before his**Urement in September 1975.   (Chapter Till, paragraphs 8.38, 8.42 - 8.44,8&apos;55, 8.60, 8.69,8.70 and 8.72 - 8.74).(xriv)   The quantities of product delivered to Parry Leon and Hayhoe411(1 Freight service a free on rail in Lourenco Marques, either by Total South***ica (during the exchange/throughput period) or after that period by Shell^caBbique, pursuant to orders placed on Shell South Africa (or BP Southern?0otnote:^)   Shell and BP Services Company.
Africa), and thereafter sold to GENTA and consigned to Rhodesia, were duringthe cal endar years 1968-1975 inclusive probably not less than the following:196a -   165,000 tons1969 180,000 tons1970 190,000 tons1971 220,000 tons1972 275.000 tons197 3 300,000 tons1974 300,000 tons1975 250,000 tons(Chapter YIH, Section C).(xxv)   When the business formerly conducted under the ConsolidatedAgreements in South Africa came to be split between the Shell and BP Groups,BP insisted on obtaining and obtained half of the business with Freight Services.Its chief local representative in South Africa knew what that business con-sis ted of.   So, with varying degrees of comprehension, did a small number ofofficers in London.   (Chapter VIII, paragraphs 8.33, 8.39 and 8.60 - 8.63).(zzvi)   From March i960 until the independence of Mozambique in June1975 ships entering Beira with cargoes of oil or oil products were subject toscrutiny by patrolling vessels of the Royal Navy.   The volume of refined productsreaching Rhodesia through Beira between the 1965 Sanctions Order and the clos-ure of the Mozambique/Rhodesian border in March 1976 was inconsiderable. No.crude oil reached Rhodesia by this route.   (Chapter IX).(xxvii)   Throughout the period since the 1965 Sanctions Order some minorproducts have reached Rhodesia from South Africa by means of the railway linethrough Botswana.   No attempt was made to intercept these supplies within thatcountry either before or after the independence of Botswana because it was believed that Botswana was economically dependent on the railway line andvulnerable to economic retaliation by Rhodesia, and also because of SouthAfrican insistence that the line be kept open.   The South African Governmentand the Consolidated marketing companies in South Africa were made aware ofHMG*s wish that supplies to Rhodesia by this route should be kept to a minimum.We are satisfied that the volumes of oil products carried by this route were
-eat, never reaching 10,000 tons in any year for which figures are available(1966-i969).     There ia no evidence that volumes increased thereafter.(Chapter X).(xzviii)   Throughout the period from the 1965 Sanctions Order until the(9)Present, minor products such as lubricants, base oils, greases, SBPs andbitumen have in the Mia reached Rhodesia direct from South Africa. G2TCAwere probably not involved in the procurement of lubricants and base oils,but Freight Services and at least one other intermediary (DL Petroleum) were involved in these sales. The procurement of minor products other than lubricantsand base oils may have been handled by GESTA but we think it more likely thatGOTTA procured bitumen only.   Freight service a acted as intermediary in aalesof all these products also.   (Chapter xl).(aadx)   During 1975 an increasing ahaxe of supplies to Freight Serviceswaa made by SASOL OX SASBAF1 direct from the Republic of South Africa by the newrail link.   The supplies came from SISBEP. 2 At about the time of the Mozam-*que/Rhodeaia border closure in March 1976 SASOL or SASRAF took over all ree-Ponsibility for the supply to Freight Services of those main producta (in par-ticular motor gasoline and gasoil) which NATRKF produced.     The South AfricanMarketing companies who had previously done business with Freight Services were,** to 85&amp; of the business ao lost, compensated by increased access to theHATHEF area of the Transvaal.   So far as we have been able to ascertain, this situation has continued up to the present.   It seems probable that neitherthe Shell nor the BP marketing companies in South Africa axe now selling toheight Services or to any intermediary who is known to be selling on to rhodesia. (Chapter EH, Sections A and D).(ttt)   After a lapse of some years contact between HMG and the Shell*hd BP Groups concerning the enforcement of sanctions was renewed in the summer of 1976.     In a letter to HMG dated the 30th June 1976, following publicationof The Oil Conspiracy in the United States by the Center for Social Action ofthe United Church of Christ, disclosure was not made of the deliveries by Shell-10-^ootnotes:(9)Special boiling-point spirits.(10) A company owned and controlled by the South African Government.South African and Iranian interests (52. 5% and 17. 5% respectively) in theSasolburg refinery near Johannesburg.(12)The Sasolburg refinery.
Mozambique to Freight Services between 1972 and March 1976 and the impression was given that the situation &quot;&quot;had remained substantially unchanged since Feb-ruary 1968.     It was known to Mr. Francis (who drafted the letter) that suchdeliveries had been made, although he thought that they ^d begun later andstopped earlier.   It was not appreciated by Mr. Francis&apos; superiors in Shellthat such deliveries had been made at all:   Mr. Francis        discussed the matter with Mr. de Liefde but   the latter had not grasped the situation. It is not en-tirely clear whether the contents of this letter were disclosed to 3F beforethe letter was sent but BP received a copy of the letter subsequently and approved of it.   The responsible senior management of BP at this time (June1976) had not been involved In the discussions with EMG in 1968-1969 and didnot appreciate the changes which had occurred in the arrangements then notified to EMG nor the possible implications of such changes. &apos; &quot;(Chapter A111,paragraphs I3.I8 - 13.23).(ttt-; )   Since a date very shortly after the 1965 Sanctions Order the consolidated marketing companies in Rhodesia have been subject to directionby the illegal Hhodesian Government on pain of criminal penalty for nan-compliance.   It has never been suggested to the Shell and BP Groups by HMGthat they should liquidate those companies or suspend their operations; hadeither of these courses been attempted the Hhodesian Government would have appointed a Custodian of the companies.   The Groups have received information concerning these companies sporadically, but not concerning procurement ofsupplies.   Directors of the companies resident in Rngland have played no partin their management.   Shell (as the channel of communication under the Consolid-ated Agreements) have remained in contact with the companies and have been ableto influence some policy decisions, but neither the Groups nor Consolidatedhave enjoyed any effective power of control.   (Chapter IH, paragraphs 3*H and3.14, Chapter V, paragraph 5.4 and Chapter XH, paragraphs 12.4-12.11 and 12.24-12.25)(xrxii)   The primary role in procuring main products for consumption onthe Hhodesian market was played (a- least so far as the Consolidated companies
&quot;0&quot;*e concerned) by G2HTA, which appears to have allocated the available aup-t- -oq to the existing Rhode a i an marketers roughly in proportion to their marketahares.   So far as we know, Caltex Oil Rhodesia played no part in procuringapplies save in the early months of i960.   There is some evidence that the consolidated companies in Rhodesia did,      probably to a minor extent, partici-Pate with GUrTA in procuring supplies.   We have had no direct evidence concern-iag Mobil and Total.   (Chapter I, paragraphs 1.74, 1.75 and 1.77, Chapter 7,Paragraph 5*81, Chapter 711, paragraph 7*57, Chapter 7IH, paragraphs 8.39 and-66(ii) &amp; (vi) and Chapter XXX, paragraphs 12.15 - 12.19).(mi 1 i)   At the time of UDI, total consumption of all petroleum products in Rhodesia was running at an annual rate of about 410,000 tons.The total fell after UDI but was restored to the old level by about 1969 and thereafter increased until it now stands at about 800,000 tons. (Chapter XII,Paragraph 12.12).B. SUBMISSIONS(l) SHELLAt the outset of our Investigation Mr. C.C. Focock, Chairman of The&quot;Shell&apos;1 Transport and Trading Company Limited, stressed to us that the prin-ciple of delegating managerial authority to local Shell companies was one in*hich the Royal Dutch/Shell Group really believes and which it fully practises.Apart from certain business principles which must always be observed, andBlatters such as financial policy and management appointments which are of direct concern to the shareholder, the business of management is entrusted tothe local management.     As a letter circulated to Shell companies in NovemberA976 put it, &quot;Fullest practicable managerial autonomy resides with each shell company&quot;.     Ve are satisfied that in practice very considerable managerialautonomy was granted to Group companies in SouthemAfrica during the period^der consideration, although their performance was carefully monitored inkoadcn and non-routine decisions were the subject of consideration there.^d&amp;6     it vas s&quot;tressed, secondly, that chief executives and local staffs^thia the Group are expected to obey the laws of ccun-ries where they live
BOand work.   This formed part of a Statement of General Business Principlesdrawn up by the Group and circulated to companies in 19761&quot;Companies should endeavour always to act commercially,operating within existing national laws in a sociallyresponsible manner, and avoid involvement in politics&quot;.This recommendation reflected OECD guidelines accepted by HMG in 1976 (seeInternational Investment.     Guidelines for International Enterprises, Cmnd.6525, 1976).   Sir Prank Mciadzean, himself a former Chairman of &quot;Shell&quot;Transport and Trading, laid particular emphasis on the importance, In his view, of local companies so far as possible avoiding involvement in nationalpolitics.   Ve think that both elements of this principle, compliance with local law and avoidance of corporate political commitments, formed part ofthe Group&apos;a philosophy and practice in Southern Africa throughout the period.li.7    It the conclusion of our Investigation SIPC made to us a detailedwritten submission drawing attention to a number of factors which, it was said,must have affected the ainda and conduct of those in Shell who were concernedwith handling the many and difficult problems caused by sanctions. InShell contended(l)   that its belief from the outset was that sanctions could not prevent supplies of oil reaching Rhodesia because ample supplies would be forthcoming from South Africa:   the withholding ofsupplies to South Africa by Shell would have caused grave damage to British commercial interests there (including the sequestra-tion by the South African Government of Shell1 a own assets) butit would not have stopped the flow of oil products to Rhodesia,(ii)   that Shell was the subject not only of a conflict between the policies of the British and South African Governments but also of an irreconcilable conflict between the policy of the SanctionsOrders (which Shell thought could only be safely complied with by cutting of supplies to South Africa) and the policy of EMG thatthere should be no economic confrontation with South Africa:
given   the   duty to comply with the local law this gave rise to the most acute practical problems,(ill)   that acceptance of the Total exchange by HMG was inevitableif confrontation with South Africa was to be avoided, but itwas felt by Shell to be a fairly transparent device since it involved continued contractual relations by Shell South Africawith (and facilitation of supplies to) Parry Leon and Hayhoe,who were known to be supplying Rhodesia;   the only change wasthat the product supplied to Parry Leon and Hayhoe now belonged to Total South Africa who in exchange received products(supplied by Fngliah-incorporated Shell and BP trading companies)elsewhere in South Africa,(iv)   that those concerned naturally and foreeeeably interpretedHMG&apos;8 concern as being to have a technical defence to the accusation that British oil was reaching Rhodesia, that defencebeing based on a narrow construction of the Sanctions Order,(v)   that between 1966 and 1972 talk of a Rhodesian settlement wasfrequently in the air:   since South African help was sought in persuading Mr. Smith to compromise there was an added reasonfor avoiding confrontation,(vi)   that those who knew of the Total exchange must have appreciated that closure of the Mozambique border would necessarily haveended the Total exchange as arranged in 1968.lA&apos;Q    This submission raises certain questions involving the evaluation ofgovernment policy upon      ch we do not feel entitled under our Terms of Refer-*Uce to comment.     But it also raises factual issues upon which the evidence given to ua doee enable us to make observations:(a)   Shell did from the outset consider that sanctions against Rhodesiacould not be effective unless South Africa also were blockaded.Within EMG also there was appreciation of difficulties whichthe sanctions policy faced.    (Chapter V, paragraph 5-3)*
(b) Sir Frank McFadzean told us that it vaa his view and thatof Mr. Berkin at the time of the 1965 Sanctions Order thatif Shell had refused to supply South Africa the South Africanswould have sequestrated Shell&apos;s assets;   they also thoughtthat the South Africans had enough engineers and that therewas enough crude oil available to enable the South Africansto run SAFREF without Shell&apos;a co-operation.   Ve have notInvestigated this matter, but have no reason to doubt SirFrank and Mr. Berkin&apos;s contemporary judgment.(c) in a practical (as opposed to a legal) sense there was an obvious conflict between the policy of HMG that oil trade to rhodesia should be reduced as much as possible and the SouthAfrican Government &apos;s policy that South African buyers shouldbe free to buy oil within South Africa irrespective of the useor destination to which they intended to use or send it.(Chapter XXX9 paragraphs 3*3 - 3*5 and Chapter 7, paragraphs.6 - 5.33).   For British citizens subject to the laws ofboth countries there was a conflict of jurisdictions in a legal sense.     (Chapter II and Chapter III, paragraphs 3.3 - 3*5).(d) shortly after the 1965 Sanctions Order Shell expressed the viewthat the only sure&apos; way of avoiding a breach of the Order wasto cease supplying the South African registered companies.(Chapter 7, paragraph 5*17)*(e) it was the policy of HMG in the yeaxs I965-I969 at all costs toavoid economic confrontation with South Africa (Chapter 7, para-graph 5.21 and Chapter 71, paragraphs 6.16, 6.20, 6.26, 6.27.6.36, 6.72 and 6.85).   Ve have received no evidence as to policyin later years.   It was recognised on all sides that the cutting off of supplies to South Africa by Shell and BP Groups was likelyto provoke such confrontation.   At his meeting with company repre-sentatives on the 21st February 1968 the Commonwealth secretary said that there were no doctrinaire or ideological objections to
trade with South Africa, save in the arms field, and&apos;other similar statements were made on other occasions.   (Chapter VI,paragraph 6.75).(f) the Consolidated marketing companies in South Africa and their employees faced very severe problems in seeking to give effectto the policy of the Sanctions Orders (Chapter III, paragraphs.3 - 3-5t Chapter 7, paragraphs 5.89 - 5-93 and Chapter 711,paragraphs 7.25 - 7.27).(g) the effect of the Total exchange was as summarised   in Chapter vui,paragraph 8.7*(h) the companies were initially doubtful as to the legality of theTotal exchange but did not disclose those doubts to HKG (Chapter71, paragraphs 6.65 - 6.68 and 6.75(iv)).     On the 6th February1969 Sir Frank McFadzean expressed the view that the exchangeseemed &quot;pretty thin!&apos; to him but &quot;legally sound&quot;. (Chapter 71, para-graph 6.83(iii)). HMG was of opinion that &quot;the legal position wassound and could be defended&quot;, and was never prepared to counten-ance what it regarded as breaches of the Orders by British ccmpan-ies.   It was appreciated within the companies (as was the case)that HMG regarded it as important to be able to assert that british oil was not reaching Rhodesia. (Chapter 71, paragraph 6.33(iii) and&apos; 6.86).(i) there were two or three occasions over the years 1966-72 when itwas widely believed that a political settlement with Rhodesianight be imminent:   for example, at the time of the talks onEMS TIGER and EMS FEARLESS, and at the time of the Douglas-Homeproposals in 1971.(j)   since the Total exchange (as arranged in 1968) involved delivery of refined products free on rail in Lourenco Marques before onwardcarriage of some or all of them to Rhodesia, the arrangement couldnot survive closure of the Mozambique-Rhodesian border. (ChapterTill, paragraphs 8.3 and 8.7).have endeavoured to take full account of this submission by S.I.P.C, both
in reaching and formulating our factual conclusions and In making the observations which we do in Section C of this Chapter.(2)   3.P. &apos; ,14.9 The position of BP was in same respects the same as that of Shell andin some different.   The main difference was that during those periodswhen and in those areas where the Consolidated Agreements were in force BPwere, even as compared with Shell in London, one step further removed fromdirect involvement in the business operations of the local companies (except,in the case of Mozambique, from 1st September 1975 onwards).   We have treatedthis subject at greater length in Chapter I, Section B.   The role of BP wasnecessarily subsidiary.   Another difference, which would seem to have influ-experienced BP1 a conduct on occasion (for example, in favouring immediate disclosureto EMG in February 1968), was the large Government shareholding in BP.BP were, however, at one with Shell in their approach to the principleof managerial autonomy.   The point was put by BP in this way:&quot;The South African subsidiary companies were not createdor used aa a sham to enable English companies to evade therequirements of English law.   Their creation occurred manyyears ago.   The autonomy which they enjoyed was conferred anthem bana fide, and was a response to a problem which con-fronts every major business operating in many countries,namely, that the host governments insist that enterprisesoperating in their country be to that extent identifiedwith the national interest of that country, and in particu-lar that commercial policy be not dictated by the politicalpolicy of the group&apos;a home government.   These are the con-ditions in which the BP Group trades in South Africa.&quot;14.10 BP would endorse the principle that local companies should comply with local laws and, as the foregoing quotation makes clear, base their decisions on commercial rather than political grounds.14.11 BP,s overriding submission was that the Group management in Londonconsistently co-operated in the enforcement of sanctions whenever its assist-once was requested by HMG, and that where on occasion it was not able toassist its position was very fully explained to HMG.   This is in our opiniontrue of the early years;   but for various reasons summarised above there wasnot a full (or indeed any) explanation to HMG of the situation found to exist
In early 1974* and. when the South African business vas split BP showed no^luctance to undertake, half the Freight Services trade.C. OBSERVATIONS14.12   In offering observations upon certain of the facts recounted and .sum-marised above, we wish to reiterate that we are excluding from our considerationquestions aa to whether any criminal -offence has been committed by any company or any individual-14.1&quot;^   Ve think it unfortunate that Mr. Walker should, aa General Manager inSouth Africa with responsibility for Mozambique, have failed between aboutthe        of 1966 and February 1968 to lay the facts known to and suspected-byhim before his superiors in London and that he should have given categoricalassurances which those facts did not warrant.   The Shell and.BP Groups InLondon and HMG were as a result led to misunderstand the means by whichRhodesia obtained its oil supplies.   Because of this misunderstanding both the groups and HMG unwittingly adopted false positions at that time.14.1A    The easiest course for Mr. Walker personally would have been to dia-close his knowledge and suspicions to Shell Centre and let others bear theburden&apos;of deciding what to do.   It has not become clear to us why he -did not do ao.     He may have wished to avoid embarrassing the Shell management inLondon.   He may also have wished to safeguard the business he was running laSouth Africa.   Awareness of the very stringent South African official secretslegislation may have played a part.   We do not think these considerationsjustify his conduct even if they explain it.1*1.1^     In rnqfc-^g this criticism we bear in mind the submission made to usagainst attributing blame to relatively Junior individuals.   We are also acute-ly aware of the difficulty of Mr. Walker&apos;a position as a South African living in a society very unsympathetic to the policy of the Sanctions Orders.   But as general Manager of the Consolidated operation in South Africa Mr. Walker wasfcot in a junior position, and it must in our view follow that if fullest prac-
ticable managerial autonomy is to reside in each local company then themanagement of that company must be regarded as responsible for the decisions which it makes.14.16 Given the prevailing management philosophy, the information receivedfrom local sources and the knowledge that existed in the Groups of local polit-ical attitudes in South Africa and Mozambique, we do not think the Groups axeto be criticised for failing during 1966 and 1967 to send a team from Tendonto investigate methods of rhodesian supply directly.   When, in January 1968,suspicion deepened, such a team was sent.   Ve axe surprised that the report made by that team did not cause some dissatisfaction with the information pre-vioualy supplied from South Africa, but we have not heard that it did. Thereason is, we think, that the facts were not, even in February 1966, known tothe Groups nearly as fully as they axe now.14.17 It was in our view a proper course for the Groups, once apprised of thefacts, to disclose them and the proposed solution to EMG and seek HMG1 b accept-ance of that solution.   Ve axe unsure whether the proposed solution was fullycommunicated in February 1966 but during the year following EMG was given suf-ficient information to enable a fair judgment to be made.   The contrary hasnot been suggested to us.   The proposed solution was. accepted.     It was there-after reasonable for the Groups to proceed upon that basis.14.18 The Total exchange arrangement plainly did not have the effect of deny-ing supplies of oil products to Rhodesia.   That an arrangement having this deficiency was accepted by HMG had, we think, an important consequence. Itinduced among some of those most directly concerned (notably Mr. Francis andMr. Walker) a belief that compliance with the Sanctions Orders was to beregarded as a matter of form rather than of substance,   that it was the letter which mattered, not the spirit.   The failure to communicate to or within ShellCentre certain matters which, aa we think, should have been communicated maybe traceable to this belief.
. 14.19     Ve think- it possible also that, because of their differing viewpointsd backgrounds, HMG and the Groups may have seen the Total exchange ratherdifferently.   To HMG the arrangement was acceptable because it took British oil companies out of the line of supply to Rhodesia and enabled it to be said thatBritish oil was not reaching Rhodesia.In the light of. Britain(s primary inter-national responsibility for Rhodesia, that seemed an object worth achievingeven though the arrangement would not deny oil to the illegal regime. Tocompany representatives, familiar with product exchanges as an everyday fact of the international oil business, the exchange might, like other exchanges,have appeared to be merely an alternative means of Biking a supply, wapproach may, we think, have coloured the thinking of same oil company employees.LA. 20     When, following the Total exchange,official pressure an the Groupseased, there was a marked reduction in the prominence given to the wholequestion of Rhodesian sanctions among those within the Groups who were concernedwith the affairs of Southern Africa.   This had a consequence of its own inthe inadequate briefing on this subject of some key executives who came freshto the Southern African scene after 1966:   on the Shell aide, for example,neither Mr. de Liefde an appointment aa Regional Coordinator nor Mr.McCutcheonon appointment as Managing Director of SEH7IC0 was Instructed aa to the pastoiatory or the Group policy on this subject;   the same was in varying degreestrue an the BP side of Mr. Laidlaw when he became Regional Managing Director,Mr. Robertson when he became Regional Director of BP Trading, Mr. Savage whenbe became Regional Co-coordinator, Mr. Milne when he became the BP representa-tive in South Africa ariri Mr. Trechman, either when he went to Mozambique asSenior Assistant in 1973, or when he became the local General Manager inSeptember 1975.     Bearing in Bind the. information given to HMG in February-56a and HMG&apos;s request recorded in Sir Frank Mciadzean1s note of that meeting*bat it should be informed of any change in the situation, we think it clearthat the Groups should not have allowed this subject to slip so far into the background.   Those responsible for keeping HMG informed of any change in the
situation could not do ao without a reasonable working knowledge of what thesituation was.14.21 It was plainly the duty of Mr. Walker as General Manager in SouthAfrica, knowing as he did the outline of what transpired between HMG and the groups in early 1968, to inform Shell Centre of the anAi-ng 0f the Total exchange and the procedures adopted thereafter.     Again ve are unclear why he did not do so.    Again we think the considerations listed in paragraph 14.14 aboveplayed a part.   We think also (despite his denial) that he was probably in-fluenced by the lack of official and company concern currently apparent inrelation to questions of sanctions enforcement.14.22 When Mr. Francis and Mr. Sandford (both of whom had detailed knowledgeof what transpired between HMG and the Groups in 1966-1969)    learned in early1974 of the ending of the Total exchange and of the arrangement a which had followed it, their duty was in our opinion to make sure that the change inthe arrangements notified to HMG was fully appreciated by the responsiblemembers of the senior management of their respective Groups.   While it was for the senior managements to decide whether a further approach to HMG was indicated and whether any (and if so what) action ahould be taken to stopsupplies, those managements should have been put in a position to make thedecision.   Both Mr. Francis and Mr. Sandford raised the matter with theirsuperiors, but neither effectively communicated the important fact that a systemof supply was in force which significantly departed, in the renewed involve-ment of Shell Mocambique, from the arrangements notified to HMG in I968-I969.This was unfortunate.14.25    It was further, we think, the duty of Messrs. Francis and Sandford,after learning the true facts in early 1974* &quot;to take steps to satisfy them-aelvea, directly or indirectly, that Shell Mocambique had been removed fromthe chain of supply to Freight Services (or, if it had not, to seek some alter-native expedient).   While the detailed steps to be taken could reasonably beseen as a matter for the local management, achievement of the result was
Learly a matter of direct concern to the Groups themselves in view of their-relations with HHG and the obligations of same companies and individuals underthe Sanctions Order.   Although for a time Mr. Francis believed that supplieshad switched to the new rail link, he learned in early 1975 that some (as hethought, residual) deliveries were continuing to be made by Shell Mocambiqueto Freight Services.   He waa never positively told that these deliveries hadceaaed and should not, we think, have let the matter rest.   Ve do not doubt the genuineness of Mr. Sandford1 a belief formed as a result of his visit toMatola in October 1974 that the Freight Services traffic had switched fromLourenco Marques to the direct route from South Africa, and we bear in Bindthe action which Mr. Sandford had already taken (see Chapter 7TH, paragraph.38 ) and the fact that BP were at this time still two steps removed fromformal responsibility for management of marketing in South Africa;   even so, wethink Sandford was easily satisfied..1*1.24    ffa^ the Groups in London appreciated that a change of obvious signifi-cance       occurred In the arrangements notified to HMG in 1966-1969, we thinkit clear that HMG should have been told and consideration given to what (if any)action should be taken to ensure that the Sanctions Orders were complied with.&quot;Their failure to tell EMG       be excused only on the basis (which we accept)Qf their ignorance or inadequate appreciation of the change which had occurred.14.25     Once it was appreciated by the Groups in January 1966 that a situation had arisen in Mozambique of which the Groups had not previously been fully informed and which was not regarded as acceptable, it should in our view havebeen seen as unsatisfactory (a) for the British-registered company in Mozambique^o be managed locally by Portuguese citizens not subject to the 1965 SanctionsOrder and (b) for that company to report through and to be operationally sub-ordiaate to a management in South Africa which waa inhibited in giving full effect to the policy of that Order.   BP did at this time ask that the General*^aaager in South Africa should be relieved of responsibility for Mozambique.sheil had reasons for resisting the proposal and it was not pursued.   It seems
to us that this was a pxscaution vhich could and should have been taken andthat the introduction of the Total exchange should not have been regarded asobviating the need  for it. &apos;Vhen, in 1975* BP appointed an expatriate general manager in Mozambique, immediately ansverable to BP in London, the appointment was unfortunately made without consideration of Rhode a i an supplies: deliveries to Freight Services accordingly continued to be made until the Mozambique/Hhodesian border was closed, the General Manager having no instructions to thecontrary.14.26 The letter written by Shell to HMG following publication of the UCCReport in June 1976 was in our view bound to convey the impression, as it did,that the arrangements disclosed in 1966-1969 had remained continuously inforce  until closure of the Mozambique/Rhodesia border in March 1976. SinceSir Frank McFadzean as signatory of the letter had not been informed to thecontrary and believed this to be the case, he cannot be blamed.   But we thinkthat Mr. Francis, as author of the letter, who knew that it was not the case,should not have allowed this Impression to be given.   11though we fully accept that he had no thought or Intention of misleading either his superiors or HMG, wethink that even (or perhaps particularly) at this late stage the need for fulldisclosure should have been apparent.14.27 The criticisms which we have made have related in the main to failuresto disclose, either within the Groups or by the Groups to HMG.   We do not regardthese failures as in any way unimportant.   The Groups should have been able to base their actions and determine their conduct vis-a-vis H2C on the basi3 ofsuch full and accurate information as was available.   In the context of therelations prevailing between it and the Groups, EMG should have been able to has its policy towards the Groups and to determine its conduct internationally on a clear understanding of the salient facts so far as these were known to the groups.     In the event both HMG and the top management of the Groups, save for limited periods (the early months of i960, the period of 2-3 years afterFebruary 1963 and perhaps the period after March 1976), were ignorant of facts
oich should have bean the subject certainly of consideration and possibly of-jtian.     This Ignorance led HMG and the top management of the Groups unwit-tingly to make statements and give assurances which they would not have done with fall knowledge of the facts.
^UI.&apos; iOj.lii.ljPART 22.1 This section is an account of events affecting Rhodesia from October 1964onwards, and is primarily concerned with the question of sanctions, moreparticularly oil sanctions.    It is necessarily brief, and does not pretend togive a full account of an issue to which an enormous amount of time and effort was devoted.    In particular, the political developments of the periodare mentioned only in so far as they have an -important bearing upon sanctionspolicy.   As explained below, convention requires that the account which follows should concern itself largely with the views of Labour governments in the period in question.    If more attention has been given to the events of 1964-70, this is in part because Mr Bingham&apos;s observations on that periodhave aroused particular interest.2.2 The new Labour Government came to power in October 1964 with a slendermajority.    It was immediately faced with the increasingly intransigentproblem of Rhodesia where the ruling Rhodesian Front under Mr Smith wasdemanding immediate independence on the basis of the 1961 Constitutionwhilst clearly determined to deny Africans any hope of majority rule.Despite the Prime Minister&apos;s warning on 27 October 1964 of the serious consequences for Rhodesia of an illegal declaration of independence (lDl)*white Rhodesian opinion tended to harden behind Mr Smith:    first in the referendum on independence held in November 196*4? and secondly in a generalelection in May 1965? in which the Rhodesian Front won all fifty of the &quot;A&quot;Roll seats and thus were assured of the necessary two-thirds parliamentaryMajority needed for certain constitutional amendments.2.2     Up until 11 November I765 the British Government sought to achieve a- negotiated settlement consistent with the five principles.*   But withthe illegal declaration of independence on 11 November Rhodesia became aeolony in rebellion against the Crown.    The Rhodesian Ministry was dismissed* The sixth principle was formulated later in January i960.251
by Her Majesty acting thrmigh the Governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs. Britain,for its part, introduced appropriate enabling legislation and began toimpose sanctions.    Sanctions were intended to.-achieve quick results bycompelling the illegal regime to return to legality and to   resume negotiationsfor the implementation of the six principles.    Oil sanctions were imposed in December 1965-2.4     Inevitably consideration of Rhodesian policy had to take account ofinnumerable factors:   the implications at any given time for the prospects of successful talks with the regime, United Nation considerations, relationswith the Commonwealth and particularly its African members, the UnitedKingdoms economic difficulties, the situation in the Middle East after thewar of June 1967* which had closed the Suez Canal and caused oil tankers tobe re-routed round the Cape, the maintenance of British commercial and investment interests in South Africa, and that country^ capacity to exerciseamoderating  influence on the Rhodesian regime, the lack of enthusiasm ofseme of 3ritainfs main allies for any measures designed to intensify sanctions,and in particular for any attempt to monitor and if necessary control the flow of oil through Lourenco Marques, to name but a few.   While the government wished to leave the door open for further talks with the regime, it sawlittle or no chance of reaching a settlement, especially following themeeting in HMS Tiger, which would satisfy its six principles or which wouldbe consistent with the principle of no independence before majority rule.As time passed it was increasingly assumed that a long haul was inevitable.In these circumstances the role of sanctions policy was to maintain pressure on the regime and on Rhodesians generally until the situation in Rhodesiachanged.    The Government was therefore at pains to seek to identify any wayof tightening sanctions in general, and oil sanctions in particular, provided&quot;that such measures were feasible and likely to be effective, and that no economic confrontation with South Africa would ensue.26/1/VMI.I! TflTIUmT A T
confidential*5      In June 1965, the Commonwealth leaders met in London and RhodesiaWas the subject of heated debate.   There were demands that Britain shouldforce.   The British Government, however, ruled out the use of forceand made this decision public.*   Although the option of force was to be^considered from time to time, the general view remained that the obstaclesfacing such an operation were so formidable, logistically and politically,*8 to rule it out as impracticable.2.6      An alternative to the use of force lay in the imposition of a variety0? sanctions.   Duringythe early months of 1965 contingency plans were drawn*P for action in the event of an illegal declaration of independence.*t the same time it was felt vital that no action should be taken which could provide a breakdown or offer the hardliners in the Rhode si an government ane*cuse for making the break.   It was also generally believed that early andWsh measures might prove counter-productive by driving moderate white opinion111 Rhodesia to support the Rhodesian Front.   Indeed by late April 1966, afterActions measures had been steadily increased, it was privately acknowledgedLondon that a side effect of these measures had been precisely this.2*7      The first British sanctions measures had the effect of freezing*todft8iacfl sterling reserves, of removing Rhodesia from the sterling area,^4 of blocking Rhodesia&apos;s access to the London money market.   ECGD coverf0r Rhodesian imports and exports was removed.   Commonwealth preferences*Sre withdrawn and a ban was placed on the major Rhodesian exports of tobacco and sugar.   Arms supplies were also banned.   Subsequently additionalfinancial controls were progressively introduced including the withdrawalof all banking facilities, the blocking of interest payments on British^vernment stocks, and the appointment of British officials to take chargeof the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia.   Early in December 1965 a whole range of^odesian goods were (or were, soon to Be&quot;) banned from entry into Britain including^oes-cos, copper, meat products, and iron and steel products.&quot; By the spring of^66 the prohibition on Rhodesian exports-to Britain was virtually-total.mos-G authoritative statement on this issue was that made by theP*ime Minister in the House of Commons on 1 November 1965-   There -were, however,0*ier statements to this effect including a press statement by the commonwealth secretary f* Boilomlev^ in Accra on .10. August 1963.   Subsequently it was ^eea- TJSLi the ^0^troop/, at the request of a legal government of Rhodesxa,the event of a breakdown of law-and order.
The aim was to restrict Rhodesia^ export ability and to cripple her capacity to earn foreign exchange.   This was a wholly British operation, achievedtinder British legislation.   Although other states were asked to supportBritish sanctionsf enforcement abroad was essentially voluntary and a matter for each state individually, until selective mandatory sanctions were introduced in December 1966.  These covered the major Rhodesian exports and certain key imports, including motor and aircraft spares and oil.The scope of mandatory sanctions was still further extended in May 1968with the introduction of a comprehensive mandatory sanctions resolution in the United Nations Security Council, and further measures have beensubsequently introduced.   A summary cannot do justice to the width orcomplexity of all these measures.2.8 it must be said, however, that the effective enforcement of sanctionsvaried from country to country.   At a very early stage two countries, SouthAfrica and Portugal (which then ruled Mozambique) , made it plain that theywould have nothing to do with sanctions on grounds of principle. ThisSouth African and Portuguese attitude established from the start a crucialSap in the effectiveness of sanctions enforcement.   Moreover the exposedPosition of Zambia, and her economic dependence on Rhodesia, especiallyfc-r the export of copper, subsequently caused special longer-term problems?or Britain as a member of the Commonwealth with close links with Zambia.*2.9 The main purpose of this section is, however, to recount the historyof oil sanctions.   It is therefore necessary to turn once more to a consideration of events in November 1965*   It was realised in London thatreta liatory measures taken immediately after IDI might not prove8^ficient in themselves for the short swift campaign then envisaged.Studies were therefore undertaken of possible additional economic sanctions,111 particular oil.   In the meantime steps had been taken to persuade theBritish oil companies to delay deliveries to the pipeline at Beira, atl*ast as a temporary measure.   This could of course do no more than defer^ arrival of such tankers since, in the absence of legal constraints, thecompanies could not claim force majeure and would be in breach of contract.Gambia formally announced the closure of her border with Rhodesia only*h January 1973.
The conclusions reached in London by the end of November 1965 were that withoutinternational co-operation, and in particular the support of the USA, Britishaction alone would be ineffective.   American support was essential both foran embargo on oil and also for the major support operations (including anairlift of P.0 Ji.) to assist Zambia once oil supplies through Rhodesia were out off.   Contingency studies also pointed to the need for Portuguese andSouth African co-operation:   the alternative being a  naval interdictionof the whole of the southern African coast.2.10 At first, the American reaction was not encouraging.   In addition be cane known that in the very near future BP and Shell tankers wouldoe   en route to Beira.   By the second week in December, however, therewere encouraging indications of American willingness to support both an embargo and a large airlift of. POL supplies to Zambia.   The Prime Ministerdeparted for Washington on 15 December, leaving his colleagues to decide onthe merits or otherwise of a suitable instnment which would ban the supplyof oil to Rhodesia and which would as a consequence go some way to meetthe American and the companies1 need to justify a claim of force majeure.^e decision to introduce a Petroleum Order in Council was taken on thesane date and the Statutory Instrument was made on 17 December 1965(SI 1965 No.2140) .   This marked the start of oil sanctions.2.11 The early weeks of the embargo were generally more successful thankad been expected. No oil entered Beira after 17 December 1965 and noneCached the Peruka refinery at Umtali after 31 December. By mid-Januarytfce refinery was reported to have been closed downt The view in London*as that the oil embargo had been extremely effective and that Rhodesianstocks had been reduced to six weeks&apos; supplies only. Sanctions generallywere having a considerable impact on Rhodesia.**12.   Certain longer term factors were, however, less encouraging. ByJanuary rumours of &apos;pirate1 tankers were beginning to circulate. . Moresignificantly, by the end of January various voluntary organisations inSouth Africa had started to organise a campaign of supplies for Rhodesia,*1&apos;he   Umtali refinery has remained closed since then.
particularly gifts of petrol; and this was to reach sizeable proportions byFebruary 1966.   The significance of this -particular gap in oil sanctionswas appreciated in London by the middle of the month although press reportsconcerning the volune were thought to be greatly exaggerated.   More worryingto London were reports that pirate tankers were preparing to sail forBeira,   Contingency plans were therefore drawn up in London for the interception of vessels with the prior authority of the flag states concerned.Naval vessels - and subsequently aircraft - were moved to the vicinity of&quot;tile Mozambique Channel,   On 17 March 1966 the first suspect tanker was intercepted and turned back with the co-operation of its flag state. but other tankers were on their way and by 2 April the Joanna V was off Beira,anortly to be followed by the &quot;Manuela1 .2.13 In this situation arrangements for interception, based on flag stateconsent, proved inadequate.   Britain therefore on 6 April sought anemergency meeting of the Security Council and on 9 April 1966 secured thePassage of Resolution 221 which authorised British warships to prevent,if necessary by the use of force, vessels carrying oil for Rhodesia from^tering Beira.2.14 Attention in London was also focussed on the need to check the flow of oil through South Africa or to persuade the South African authorities toagree at least to limit it to the level obtaining before IDI.   The South African&quot;^iew was however that business should continue as usual. Nevertheless*nere were signs that sanctions generally were still a good deal more effective than was publicly thought.   Unfortunately there were alsoEarnings that sanctions were beginning to impose a serious and unwelcomeourden on the British economy and the balance of payments.^*&quot;*5     In August 1966 a further review of options once again ruled out the^e of force.   The possibility of transferring the Rhodesia problem to the^aited Nations was considered and rejected.   This led to the consideration01 mandatory sanctions either on selected exports or on oil alone. The&quot;^al risk, as perceived in London, was that such action might fail to be .decisive whilst leading inevitably to sanctions against South Africa, Theconsequences 1 either way, were likely to be disastrous for the 3ritishEconomy,   While it was thought to be physically possible to stop oilSoing through Mozambique, it was accepted that the flow would probably switch30fifiWPTnTTNTT AT.
to South Africa with little or no interruption.    This would bring the dangers of an economic confrontation nearer, and it was the Governmentsconsidered judgement that Britain could not face the consequences of oilsanctions against the Republic.    Sanctions had however forced Mr Smith to turn once more to the negotiating table.2.16 In September 1y66, Commonwealth heads of government met in London.After stormy discussions they agreed to a further period for negotiationbut on condition that if this failed some form of mandatory sanctions wouldbe introduced and that Britain would withdraw all terms for settlement short of ITIBMR.   At the same time Britain made it clear that she would not undertakean economic confrontation with South Africa.    It was at first hoped in london that in the event of a mandatory resolution on oil being introduced it couldbe limited to Mozambique; but each time that the question   was considered this was seen to be unrealistic.    Consideration was then given to limiting the resolution either to selected Rhodesian exports or to a general banon oil, whilst reserving the British position over enforcement. Whilstenforcement against Mozambique alone seemed possible, the economic risk for britain of enforcement against South Africa was too great.    It was recognisedthat should mandatory sanctions be embarked upon and prove ineffective, then the probabilities of being drawn into an economic confrontation with SouthAfrica were much closer.2.17 Negotiations with the regime made considerable progress during theautumn of 1966 and the Prime Minister met Mr Smith on board HMS Tiger or.2 and 3 December.   Mr Smith then returned to Salisbury to consult? hiscolleagues before rejecting the proposals.    In accordance with the ccramit-nients made at the time of the Commonwealth Conference Britain prepared to go&quot;to the United Nations for a resolution imposing selective mandatory sanctions.Those most immediately concerned were still aware that it was vital not&quot;to allow such action to develop into economic warfare against South Africa.The assessment in London was that the new measures would have a seriousout not necessarily crippling effect on Rhodesia if South Africa continuedher policy of normal trade and refused to comply with mandatory sanctions.The 3ritish        must therefore be to bring sanctions to a pitch of maximum efficiency subject only to the proviso of avoiding economic confrontationwith the Republic.   At the same time there might be scope for unobtrusiveconsultation with South Africa in an effort to persuade her to bring pressures&quot;to bear on Rhodesia: South Africa&apos;s ability to exercise a moderating influence on rhodesia was generally recognised in London.
2.18     On 16 December 1966, the Security Council adopted Resolution 232imposing selective mandatory sanctions on Rhodesia1^ major exports andon certain key imports including aircraft and vehicle parts and oil. TheBeira Patrol Resolution (221/1966) remained however unaltered, and britain responsibility for naval action was still restricted to the port of Beira,2*19    The United Kingdom immediately introduced appropriate Orders inCouncil to give Resolution 232 full effect in law.   It was at this stage that those concerned with policy became aware of a critical legal loopholewhich stemmed from the doctrine of the separate legal personality ofsubsidiary companies and from Britain&apos;s consequent inability to applyUnited Kingdom domestic law extraterritorially to the activities of foreignsubsidiaries of parent companies registered in the United Kingdom, Therewas as a consequence a considerable internal debate on this issue, but no generally acceptable solution could be devised to meet the problem. Thelegal problem therefore remained unresolved.2.20 In the years 196*7-^ Ministers considered a ub&amp;a variety of ways inwhich oil sanctions against Rhodesia might be intensified.   In February 1967it was suggested that a further demarche be made in Lisbon to urge thenecessity of ending the flow of oil supplies through Mozambique to Rhodesia,^t was thought that if Portugal could be persuaded to comply with the december 1966 Security Council resolution, South Africa might possibly not^ake up any resultant shortfall in Rhodesia&apos;s supplies.   It was judgedthat the French Government would not wish to associate itself in any approach*0 Portugal, in part because of the Compagnie Francaise de Petroles&apos; (CFP)Position as a amjor supplier of crude and refined cil to Mozambique.2.21 Despite its opposition to sanctions and to the denial of goods in transit to a landlocked country, the Portuguese Government: appeared todelicate that it might be ready to accept a rationing scheme provided thatMozambique&apos;s own supplies were not affected and that Portugal was not&quot;2ciUired to police any such scheme.   This in itself, however, would not have^solved the difficulties of enlisting the co-operation of Mozambique&apos;s oilauPpliers, and of making suitable arrangements for the supply of oil to&quot;those parts of the Transvaal, as well as Swaziland and Botswana, traditionallytouted through Lourenco Marques.   Further talks with the major foreign oil
companies and their Governments were therefore necessary; and during the summer of 1967 the Prime Minister raised the matter personally withGeneral de Gaulle.   General de Gaulle undertook to look into the matter,but nothing transpired.2.22     In July 1967 the question of oil sanctions was again considered.It was by then assumed that CPP would not cooperate in any scheme to rationsupplies to Mozambique.   It was also believed that the greater part of refined products reaching Rhodesia were either supplied directly from the refineryat Lourenco Marques, or were imported and then re-exported by Portuguesecompanies in Mozambique.   Consequently, while the Government remained anxious&quot;to avoid a confrontation with South Africa, it was also prepared to study the practical implications of a naval blockade, whether by the UnitedKingdom or by the United Nations, of Lourenco Marques as well as Beira.2*23     It became clear, however, that such a blockade would be extremelyQJ^difficult to organise.   The South African Government had recentlyindicated that it would not be willing or able to prevent oil suppliesreaching Rhodesia from South African suppliers, should suppliesthrough Mozambique cease.   The United kingdom s relations with Portugalwould be seriously affected; and the United States and French Governments^re judged most reluctant to agree to any blockade.   A complete navalbio ckade would be particularly controversial; but a blockade which sought to ration imports of oil or oil products by limiting them to the needsof normal customers (the Transvaal, Swaziland, and Botswana included)other than Rhodesia would be almost impossible to administer and would lead to constant disputes with suppliers.   The operation would be farlarger and costlier than the Beira patrol.   In short the argumentsgainst a blockade appeared overwhelming, and in October 1967 itwas reluctantly decided not to pursue the idea.   It was, however,believed that CFP might be brought to reconsider their position giventhe strong views of many African Governments on the regime1 s continuedability to import oil.33
2.24    At this stage the question arose of possible supplies of oil to rhodesia by United Kingdom oil companies.   For some time the portuguese government had complained, when asked to take effective measures to haltthe supply of oil to Rhodesia, that UK oil companies were providing by far the greater part of Rhodesia^ imports.   The oil companies had rejected these allegations, and had informed the Government that theirsubsidiaries were under strict instructions not to supply oil to Rhodesia.The Portuguese authorities had not produced firm evidence, such as a listof rail link oil tankers carrying oil to Rhodesia.   The British Government&apos;sown investigations had suggested that any refined oil products delivered toLourenco Marques for bulk storage by US and UK companies - themselves only a relatively small proportion of&apos;oil imports into Mozambique - were largelydestined for the Transvaal.2*25    While in principle there would have been much to be said for seeking to divert the Transvaal trade through a South African port rather thanthrough Lourenco Marques, so as to put the performance of UK oil companiesabove all possible criticism, it was recognised after further study thatthere were practical, political and economic objections to such a course.It was thought possible, however, that some of the companies1 customersVere reselling-oil to Rhodesia- - The Commonwealth -Secre-tary- (*ir-ueorge Thomson)-Consequently informed his colleagues that he intended to-,meet the directors of Shelland BP to discuss with them the problems surrounding the supply of oilthrough Lourenco Marques, and to press for yet stronger evidence that thetwo companies were not involved in trade with Rhodesia. Mr Thomson duly net the  directors of Shell and BP on 11 December 1967, and the latter agreedto seek further information from their South African subsidiaries.2-26     These developments took place at a time when sterling had been devalued,^d when the Commonwealth Secretary^ talks with the regime had shown that thelatter1 s position had hardened in the year since the meeting in HI-IS Tiger,^t was believed that support in many countries for the maintenance ofSahctions would decline;   and while Ministers were determined to maintainPressure upon the regime, they were reluctant to embark upon new sanctions
measures which might prove ineffective and which would give rise to endlessdifficulties with other Governments.   Indeed, it was argued that the UnitedKingdom should disengage from the Rhodesian problem by renouncing sovereignty over Rhodesia and by transferring it in some way to the United Nations, whichwould itself assume more responsibility for the enforcement of sanctions by all member states.   While this possibility was under study, Ministers instructed thatthe consideration of the intensification of sanctions, including the preventionof the supply of oil to Rhodesia through Mozambique, should be deferred. In&quot;the event, the question of disengagement was not pursued, and it was recognised&quot;that Britain had no option but to soldier on.   Optimism about the early effective-ness of sanctions, however, had given way to a realisation that they would yieldresults only over time.2.27 The first months of i960 also saw increasing discussion of the possibilityof imposing comprehensive mandatory sanctions against Rhodesia.   The UnitedKingdom had already gone far in this direction, and the substance of a possibleSecurity Council resolution providing for comprehensive mandatory sanctions didno&quot;t give rise to any insuperable difficulty except in so far as it was judgedthat South Africa, Portugal and some other countries would not heed it, and thati&quot;ts results would be relatively meagre.   Nevertheless the imposition of conpre-kensive mandatory sanctions would demonstrate to Rhodesians that the internationalcommunity remained determined to restore legality.   As discussions, at theBaited Nations and elsewhere, of comprehensive mandatory sanctions proceeded,Specially after the executions of March 1966* so consideration in London of theParticular question of oil sanctions receded.2.28 This was nevertheless again discussed in March 1963.   By that time theexecutions in Rhodesia had aroused wide-spread indignation, and it was agreedtilat, whatever the longer-term considerations arguing for radical changes in^itish policy, the situation had altered and a reaction by the internationalcommunity to the executions was inevitable.   The main issue was that of compre-^ersive mandatory sanctions; but it was agreed that consideration should beSiven once again to negotiating with Portugal the introduction of a scheme tocontrol the entry of crude and refined oil into Mozambique.   Given Rhodesia&apos;sdatively small needs, and the probability that some countries would not co-operate*he difficulties were evident.   There was, however, some hope that the portuguese government might now accept a rationing scheme in the light of the pressuresGilding up at the United Nations for comprehensive mandatory sanctions.* A number of Africans who had been sentenced to death in Rhodesia were executedin March i960 despite the exercise of the Royal prerogative of clemency.35CONFIDENTIAL
2.29 It seemed clear that the bulk of Rhodesia^ oil supplied derived both from the refinery at Lourenco Marques, and from refined products imported into Mozambique, passing in both cases through the hands of intermediaries.While it was still thought that most of the oil reaching Rhodesia derivedfrom CPPf as the major supplier of oil to Mozambique, it was accepted that&quot;the oil reaching Rhodesia probably came from supplies delivered to Mozambiqueby all the major companies, including Shell and BP.   It was also thought that&quot;the oil companies might have some idea of what was going on, but that theirdenial of responsibility for the arrangements was made in good faith. Bythat time those Ministers most directly concerned were aware of the outcome of the 6ommorrwealth Secretary&apos;s second meeting with the directors of Shelland BP on 21 February 1968 and of the arrangements proposed by the two companies,in general terms, to remove their subsidiaries from the direct line of supply.2.30 In considering a rationing scheme, it was again accepted that itWould not be possible to deny oil to Rhodesia except by limiting imports into Lourenco Marques to a level below the normal demands of Mozambiqueand the Transvaal, and that this in turn would entail enforcement measures against Mozambique and South Africa.   To proceed by co-operation, on theother hand, would require the acquiescence both of the international oil companies and of the Portuguese and South African Governments, since otherwise the latter might meeely make good the shortfall of supplies to rhodesia.   There seemed no possibility that CFP, which had substantial interestsin both Mozambique and South Africa, would join in a rationing scheme,and it was thought that measures aimed at Mozambique would lead inevitably to demands for similar measures against South Africa, which Britain, and itwas assumed other countries too, were not prepared to contemplate. nor was the South African Government likely to act to curtail supplies from south Africa to Rhodesia.   The point was made that the new information concerning the past activities of United Kingdom companies would give rise&quot;to considerable embarrassment at the United Nations.36COirFTDEinTAL
C01TFTDS27TIAL2*31     This analysis, together with a number of other sanctions issues,was considered in late March 1968.   It was judged that rationing byagreement was not feasible, and that any attempt on Britain&apos;s part to&quot;tighten oil sanctions would be both ineffective and likely to harm Britishinterests in South Africa.   No further study of the question was made during this period, and attention increasingly shifted to the negotiationsunder way in Hew York on a Security Council resolution imposing comprehensivemandatory sanctions.   Thereafter the question of further talks with the regime, culminating in the meeting of October 1968 in HMS Fearless,dominated discussion of Rhodesia until the steps towards the introductionof a republican constitution there put an end to talks with the regime.2.32     Sanctions meanwhile remained in force.   In May and June 1969,consideration was once more given to a general review of British sanctionspolicy and of the maintenance of the Beira patrol.   Those Ministers and departments primarily concerned had been informed of the outcome of theMinister without Portfolio&apos;s* meeting with the representatives of Shell andBP on 9 February 1969.   This consideration took place against the background of the forthcoming: referendum in Rhodesia (17 June 196*9) on the adoptionof a republican constitution.   The conclusions reached were that existingsanctions policy and the Beira patrol should both be maintained, althoughit was appreciated that the latter would become an increasingly difficult task after the completion of withdrawal of British forces east of Suez,due in 1971*   Consideration was given to additional sanctions measures;hut these were thought likely to be ineffective and therefore likely to&quot;bring overall sanctions policy into disrepute.   It was recognised that themoves in Rhodesia towards republican status might increase pressures for new action.   Britain, however, could not afford the cost of an economicconfrontation with South Africa and&apos; Portugal, and it was agreed that anystep in that direction would have to be resisted.37*Mr George Thomson
2*33   No further general review on sanctions policy took place before the 1970General Election,   There was some discussion of the proposed ban on communications with Rhodesia, to which Britain was opposed, and a largely successful effort wasaade to persuade other countries to close their Consulates in Rhodesia following the proclamation of a republic there in March 1970.   The question of sharing theBeira patrol with other countries was also considered; it was however concluded&quot;that Britain must continue to shoulder this burden alone.2*34   Convention does not permit a similar analysis by the present government ofthe preoccupations of the Conservative administration between June 1970 and february 1974*   It would instead be appropriate to review briefly the developments in Rhodesia policy during that period by reference to statements by government spokesmen in the two Houses of Parliament.2*35   Immediately upon entering office the new Government declared their intentionQf making &quot;a further effort to find a sensible and just solution of the RhodesianProblem in accordance with the five principles&quot;.    (The Queen&apos;s Speech, 2 July 1970.Official Report, House of Lords Vol 311 Col. 10.)   On 6 July 1970 the SecretaryQf State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Sir Alec Douglas-Home) told theHouse of Commons &quot;We shall in due course explore the possibilities of an acceptablesettlement in Rhodesia.   Meanwhile sanctions, including the Beira Patrol, will&quot;Qe continued.&quot;    (Vol 803, Col 322).2*36   On 9 November 1970 the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs told Parliament that contact had been made with the Rhodesian authoritiesto establish whether there was a realistic basis for a negotiated settlement:&quot;in the Government&apos;s view sanctions should continue during this attempted nego-negotiation&quot; (Vol 606 Col 35).^37   After lengthy exploratory exchanges the Secretary of State for foreign and Commonwealth Affairs visited Salisbury between 16 and 24 November 1971 for discussions with Mr Smith.   Before his departure he reaffirmed to Parliament (or.10 November 1971) that &quot;sanctions remain in force while we see whether agreementls possible&quot; (Vol 825 Col 1090).   It was announced in Parliament on 25 November1971 that proposals for a settlement, agreed with Mr Smith, would be put beforejptoe people of Rhodesia as a whole in a test of acceptability.
2.38 3etween January and March 1972 a Commission under Lord Pearceconducted a test of opinion within Rhodesia.   The Governments policy on sanctions during this period was outlined in the House of Lords bythe Lord Privy Seal (Sari. Je-iiicoe)j &quot;It is in fact &quot;bur established, and^- longstandingpolicy to resist the widening of sanctions ..... because we believethat the implementation of existing measures by the international community,particularly those countries professing to enforce controls but failing to do so conscientiously! would have far greater effect than the introductionof new measures&quot;.   (Vol 327 Col 265) *2.39 On 23 May 1972 the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs announced the conclusion of the Pearce Commission that the peopleof Rhodesia as a whole did not regard the proposals before them as an acceptable basis for independence.   It was suggested that there shouldbe a &quot;time for reflection&quot; on the implications of the concusions.   In themeantime sanctions, including the Beira Patrol, should be maintained. On12 June 1972f the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary re-affirmed theGovernment.&apos;s policy on sanctions in the following terms:   &quot;Her Majesty1 sGovernment are already taking every step open to them to make existingsanctions effective by strict enforcement within Britain and by reportingsuspected breaches to the Security Council.   Sanctions evasion, however,is still widespread.   There is no need for new machinery:   what is required is a stricter enforcement by the international community of existingmeasures&quot; (Vol 838 Col 967) .   In a House of Commons debate on the PearceReport which took place on 15 June 1972 an Opposition amendment calling uponthe Government to &quot;intensify and strengthen the present policy of sanctions&quot;was defeated.2*40     During the concluding months of the Conservative administration,while the Government waited to see whether contacts between political partieswithin Rhodesia would create conditions for settlement negotiations, sanctionspolicy remained essentially unchanged.   On 13 June 1973 the Minister of Stasefor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Lord Balniel) stated that the Governmentwere &quot;prepared to consider any practical proposals for the more effectiveenforcement of existing sanctions.   However, while these are not beingenforced fully we see no purpose in introducing new measures&quot;. (Vol 857*Written annex col 318) .   The Government adopted a similar position on
8 November 1973 in advocating a further renewal of sanctions legislation:it was noted that the Pearce Commission had reported African opinion withinRhodesia to the effect that sanctions were a price &quot;the Africans were readyto pay&quot; (vol 863 Col 1317) *40CONFIDENTIAL
PART 3NEXT STEPS AND THE FORM OF ANY&quot; FURTHER INQUIRY&quot;3.1 The next step is for Parliament to debate the Bingham Report and toexpress its view on the desirability, purpose and form of any furtherinquiry, bearing in mind that any inquiry would have to satisfy threeconditions:    it must be effective;    it must be credible;   and it must be fair.   The need for fairness would apply as much to matters of reputationas to questions of legality.3.2 i The purpose of the inquiry could be to consider the part played by those concerned during successive Administrations in relation to thedevelopment and application of the policy of oil sanctions against Rhodesia.3.3 In considering the different forms of inquiry which would be possible,Parliament should be aware of certain legal consequences.   The matters dealtwith in the Bingham Report have already been referred to the Director ofPublic Prosecutions and it will be for him to decide, after any necessarypolice investigations, whether any criminal prosecutions should be brought.Whilst publication of the Bingham Report has not created, and is unlikely to create, unacceptable prejudice such as to rule out prosecutions, thequestion of prejudice will need to be considered again in the light of anyfurther inquiry that may be instituted.   A wide-ranging inquiry might wellcreate such prejudice.   If the terms of reference were sufficiently narrowand if the inquiry were held in private the risk of prejudice would bereduced.   Even in the case of inquiries held in private, however, it hasoften been considered essential to grant immunity from prosecution towitnesses.   Without such immunity persons would be reluctant to come forward as witnesses or to answer questions which may incriminate themselves, andthus an inquiry would be impeded from arriving at the truth.   Of course,the more narrow the terms of reference of any further inquiry the more itmay be possible to proceed without recourse to the evidence of the potentialdefendants.3.4 The rest of this section considers the various possible forms ofan inquiry.
confidential*5      A Select Committee.   Both Houses of Parliament are able, separatelyor jointly, to establish Select Committees which have many of the necessary powers and facilities for an Inquiry.   Their normal procedure is inves-tigative and they proceed by examination of witnesses, in public or in private.   They are however normally used to investigate general matters arising from departmental policies.   The members of the Committee, whosecomposition reflects the political balance of the House are responsiblefor the conduct of the inquiry, for determining the line of questioning,and for pressing it home.   They are also responsible for weighing theevidence, formulating conclusions and, in normal cases, making recommen-dations to the House.   As with many other forms of special inquiry, they therefore combine the roles of inquisitor and judge.   Select committees were once used extensively for investigations into fthe alleged misconductof Ministers or other public servants&apos; in the words of the Salmon Commission.But they were not on the whole successful when used for this purpose. Forexample in 1911* a Select Committee was appointed to look into the Marconiscandal despite pressure from the then opposition for a judicial inquiry.It divided exactly on party lines.   A majority report exonerated theMinisters concerned while a minority found them guilty of gross impro-priety.   A debate in the House of Commons led to a vote on similar lines.As the Salmon Committee recorded, the difficulty of using Select committees for this type of investigation was recognised as long ago as 1888, when an act was passed creating a Special Commission to investigate one such caseof this kind;    and following the Marconi inquiry, no further Select committees were appointed for this purpose.3.6      A Select Committee would therefore have mixed advantages and disad-vantages.   It would meet the political demand for an early and thorough investigation.   It would be composed, by definition, of experiencedpoliticians, though not necessarily of Members with experience of government or the law.   It would have the usual powers to send for persons and papers,but a Select Committee of one House could not compel the attendance of amember of the other without that House1s consent.   3ecause it would combineinvestigative with quasi-judicial functions, witnesses could reasonably seek the right to be represented by Counsel, as they were at the time of the marconi Inquiry.   But Select Committees (unlike Private Bill Committees) donot normally now operate in this way and changes to Standing Orders might berequired if Counsel were to be allowed to cross-examine witnesses.42
3*7      A Special Commission set up by Act of Parliament *   In the period upto the first world war, a number of Special Commissions were established byAct of Parliament to conduct inquiries of this kind.   Typical examples werethe special Commission appointed by the Act of [1916*] to inquire into various aspects of the conduct of the military campaign in Gallipoli and Mesopotania.This Act, like earlier ones, made express provision for membership of theCommission the enforcement of attendance of witnesses, compelling theproduction of documents, punishment of persons guilty of contempt and theissue of commission or request to examine witnesses abroad.   However when in 1921 it was felt necessary to appoint a similar inquiry to investigateinto allegations against the Ministry of Munitions, the practice of havingseparate Acts was abandoned and reliance placed on permanent legislation in the form of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act of 1921.3.8 A Tribunal under the 1921 Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) act the Act of 1921 makes provision for the setting up of a Tribunal by resolution of both Houses of Parliament to inquire into a definite matter of urgentpublic importance.   The Act itself provides that any such Tribunal shall havethe necessary powers to demand the attendance of witnesses and the productionof papers, and makes a number of supplementary provisions which flow from this.It does not lay down the procedure of the Tribunal, but it provides that itmay exclude the public from its hearings if it is in its opinion expedientso to do;    and it allows (but does not require) the representation of wit-nesses by Counsel or Solicitors.3.9 The Salmon Commission considered carefully the justification forfurther tribunals of this kind.   It concluded that the procedure should beretained for matters of &quot;rumoured instances of lapses in accepted standards of public administration and other matters causing public concern whichcannot be dealt with by ordinary civil or criminal processes&quot; providedcertain principles were observed in its administration.   These principleswere listed as follows -a. Before any person becomes involved in an inquiry, the Tribunalmust be satisfied that there are circumstances which affect him andwhich the Tribunal proposed to investigate.43
b. Before any person who is involved in an inquiry is called asa witness he should be informed of any allegations which are made against him and the substance of the evidence in support of them.c. He should be given an adequate opportunity of preparing his case and of being assisted by legal advisers.d. He should have the opportunity of being examined by his ownsolicitor or counsel and of stating his case in public at the inquiry.e. Any material witnesses he wishes called at the inquiry should,if reasonably practicable, be heard.f. He should have the opportunity of testing by examinationconducted by his own solicitor or counsel any evidence which may affect him.3.10 The Salmon Commission also drew attention to the problem of representation of the Tribunal itself.   Since, as in the case of a SelectCommittee, the Tribunal acts both as inquisitor and judge, Tribunals have in practice had the services of a distinguished lawyer to conduct the case before them.   In the past the Attorney General has appeared.   The SalmonCommission thought that this would put the Attorney General (or in scotland the Lord Advocate) in an invidious position especially where the Tribunalwas investigating the conduct of a Government of which he was a member.They recommended that in future the Tribunal should select its own Counsel.The Government did not however accept this recommendation and it was told that a Tribunal should consult the Attorney before deciding whether or nota Lav/ Officer should appear.3.11 Despite the strict observance of these principles, the procedure ofthe 1921 Act was criticised following the inquiry into the collapse ofthe Vehicle and General Insurance Company.   As a result of those criticisms,it is now generally accepted that in inquiries of this kind, all witnessesfrom the public services as well as the Government Departments should havethe right to be individually represented from the start of an inquiry, incase criticisms of their conduct emerged in the course of its investigation.These principles have been followed in the most recent Tribunal to beestablished, that into the affairs of the Crown Agents, constituted in[February 1978].44
3.12 An inquiry under the 1921 Act, subject to the safeguards identifiedby the Salmon Commission, would be an effective instrument for ascertaining the facts if it were conducted by suitably qualified people.   It is lessclear that it would be an appropriate body to pass a political (in anon-party sense) judgement upon the political handling of these facts.The composition of such a Tribunal would therefore require careful thought.Although the 1921 Act does not require it it might be assumed that a tri-bunal should be headed by a judge as the Salmon Commission recommended, Butthere is nothing in the Act to prevent his being joined by other persons,perhaps those experienced in government and administration, or indeed by others drawn from a wider circle.   The sole requirement would be that theyshould command public confidence and respect.   Such confidence would be most likely to be forthcoming, however, if they were known to have suitable andrelevant experience, and yet not supposed to be biased on this account.3.13 A Judicial Inquiry without statutory powers.   In 1963, Lord Denning,Master of the Rolls, was appointed by the Government to conduct an inquiry into the Profumo Affair.   That Inquiry was not conducted under the 1921 Actbut on a non-statutory basis.   The Inquiry was conducted behind closed doors.None of the witnesses heard any of the evidence given against him by othersor had any opportunity of testing such evidence.   Lord Denning had in effectto act as detective, solicitor, Counsel and Judge.   The Salmon Commissionsadd that the Denning report commanded public acceptance only because of hisrare qualities and high reputation and recommended that future inquiries ofthis kind should be avoided as being inferior to an inquiry under the 1921 Act.3.14 A Royal Commission.   Another possibility, listed by the SalmonCommission but not used for this purpose in recent years, would be a RoyalCommission.   Salmon pointed out that they are normally appointed to make recommendations on matters of broad policy;   they do not normally sit full-time, and while they have power to call for evidence and they do not havepox-jer to enforce this demand.   For these reasons the Salmon Commission didnot see a Royal Commission as a practical alternative to a M921 Act1 Tribunal.3.15 A non-statutory Inquiry.   Proceedings under the 1921 Act are protractedand complicated.   Partly as a result, a number of recent Inquiries have been of a less formal kind, composed of one or more people appointed by theGovernment to investigate, for example, allegations of misconduct or45
incompetence.   Their members may be lawyers or laymen. Technically-qualifiedexperts may be added as members or as assessors.   They have no formal powers;in particular they cannot compel the attendance of witnesses or the productionof documents.   Evidence is not given on oath.   They depend for their effec-tiveness on the co-operation of all parties and on their wish for fulldisclosure of all the relevant facts.   Apart from the Denning Inquiry referredto above, which was a special case, it is not a procedure which has been usedfor major investigation processes, particularly where questions of criminalliability may be involved.3.16     A Committee of Privy Counsellors.   Certain types of allegation,particularly those involving security matters, are often dealt with by aCommittee of Privy Counsellors.   Such a body could function quickly andflexibly.   Its composition could combine judicial and political experiences:and the fact that its members were Privy Counsellors would make it easier toproduce communications from foreign governments and other sensitive material to them.   Such a body could be given the added status of a Royal Commission.Such an inquiry would be, by its nature, be the least ,open* of the optionsdisplayed in this White Paper, but it might most readily reconcile the conflicting requirements of the wider national interest and the protectionof the individual.9 October 197846CONFIDENTIAL
