SECRETS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(78) 76 COPY NO11 July 1978CABINETPAY POLICY AFTER JULYNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer. On the basis of a series of discussions with leading members of theTrades Union Congress (TUC), and with the help of colleagues directly andclosely concerned in the operation of the current round of pay policy, I have prepared the attached draft of a White Paper on pay policy after July.2. It is clear that the TUC will not enter into any overt agreement withthe Government on pay policy after July;  nor will they - as they did last year with the 12-month rule - be able to offer helpful and positive guidance them-selves.    At the same time, I believe they are anxious to avoid causingembarrassment and will therefore avoid openly challenging our policy.3. The general structure of the policy builds upon the successes of thecurrent round, but with a much lower target whose achievement would lead toa substantial further reduction in the rate of inflation.    Wherever possible inpresentation and on some points of detail, account has been taken of views expressed by the TUC.D W treasury Chambers11 July 1978SECRET
fcz CIR b t j   n July 1978THE ATTACK ON INFLATION  : THE FUTURE COURSE1.      The Government is working with all concerned in industry toimprove Britain&apos;s economic performance so as to produce a high wage,high output, high employment economy.    We cannot achieve this objective unless we get the rate of inflation down at least to that ofour international competitors and keep it there.    That is why forthe last three years we have given first priority to reducing therate of inflation.    Our success has been dramatic.    In March 197^inflation was running at an annual rate of 13.5 per cent compared with12 months earlier and 18.1 per cent compared with December 1973. Thethreshold provisions of the pay policy then current were due to betriggered 11 times by October 197^ and the fact that the money supply had increased in 1972 and 1973 at twice the rate of money GDP made asubstantial further increase in inflation inevitable.    The rate of inflation as measured by the year-on-year increase in the retail price Index has now fallen to around 8 per cent - under a third the peak rate of 26.9 per cent reached in August 1975 and under half the17.6 per cent rate of July 1977 a year ago.    The Government&apos;smonetary and fiscal policies have played an important role in thisachievement.    But the key to our success has been co-operationbetween the Government, the unions and employers in moderating theincrease in wage costs through responsible collective bargaining.2.      In July 1977 the Government set the guideline for the growth in earnings at 10 per cent - very much lower than the increase in theRPI over the previous year.    It now seems likely that earnings will grow by rather more than 10 per cent over 1977-1978 as a whole. Partof the excess will arise from self-financing productivity deals andwill not raise prices;    on the contrary it will contribute to thatimprovement in our industrial performance which is our prime objective.Overall, output per man has been lower in Britain than in other major industrial countries for many years and has also been growingmore slowly.    There is general agreement in industry that the flexibility permitted in the current pay round for self-financingproductivity deals is helping to reduce this weakness in our industrial performance.3. The last twelve months have produced impressive proof of theadvantages which working men   and women can gain by keeping wage
(secret;costs down.      The halving of the rate of inflation hasmade it possible for the Government to make substantial reductions in income tax and increases in social benefits. Asa result, living standards have already increased during thecurrent pay round by some 5 per cent.4.      The cuts in taxation announced over the last twelve months will also help to increase output and employment.    Allowing forseasonal variations, unemployment has been falling slowly forthe last nine months.      The temporary employment subsidy andother special measures have made a substantial contributionover the last two years and the reinforcement to these measures announced on the 15 March should raise the number of jobs or training places thus provided to ^400,000 by March 1979. Buta return to high employment can be achieved only by fastereconomic growth.      The 12\ billion tax cuts proposed in thisyear&apos;s Budget are already contributing to the improvement in living standards.      They will also lower unemployment in britain - but only to the extent that those who receive themspend their money on British goods.      They cannot be expectedto do so if the price of British goods is higher than that offoreign goods.      So we shall get the increase in output andemployment at which we aim only if we press home the attackon inflation so as to maintain and extend the gains we havemade in recent years.5.      Although our current inflation rate of around 8 per centis about the average for industrial countries and lower, forexample, than that of France and Canada it is stillconsiderably higher than some of our most active competitorslike Germany and Japan.      Moreover, if excessive labour costsstart inflation moving up again in Britain, pressure on the  sterling may lead to a further increase in our inflation rate and that in turn to a further increase in wage costs, sorecreating the vicious circle from which we have so recentlyescaped.      The latest indications are that unit labour costs in the United Kingdom are now growing faster than in other majorcountries, while productivity overall remains lower despite the gains made in some cases in the current round.

Unless thereis a noticeable improvement in the growth of productivity or a
(SECRET)substantial decrease in the growth of money earnings - andpreferably both - unit labour costs in the United Kingdom willcontinue to grow too fast and inflation will once again starton an upward spiral.6. The nation&apos;s spectacular success in bringing the rate of inflation down to its present level faces us with a choice.We can either, as so often in the post-war period, letourselves go and enjoy a temporary boom in earnings followedby a further period of severe restraint.      Or we can learn fromthe lessons of the last few years and look forward to a steadygrowth in living standards, output and employment throughcontinued responsibility in pay bargaining.7. Everyone knows that excessive pay increases generateinflation and that inflation destroys jobs.      With inflation athalf the level of a year ago and living standards much improved,the climate of pay negotiation is likely to reduce the pressure for excessive pay increases.      We should aim at a long termapproach in which collective bargaining is based on a broadagreement every year between Government, unions and employersabout the maximum level of earnings which.is compatible withkeeping inflation under control in the following twelve months.The Government&apos;s policy for the next round has been shaped so asto permit a transition to such longer term arrangements.Consultations8. The Government has discussed the coming pay round with the tuc, whose partnership in the attack on inflation has been of vital importance.      These discussions have taken placein the context of economic and social policy as a whole. TheGovernment has found such consultations valuable in widening itsunderstanding of the tuc&apos;s point of view and achieving a broadmeasure of consensus on economic and social objectives. TheGovernment intends to keep in close and continuous consultationwith the trade union movement on the whole range of its economic policies.      The CBI and other bodies have also been consulted
(secret)and their viev/s too are reflected in parts of this white paper.      The Government has been grateful for these contributions and will continue to welcome the suggestions of all concerned.The 1978-79 Fa?/ Round9. In formulating its counter-inflation policy the Governmenthas had to reconcile the need to contain inflation with the needfor flexibility in pay bargaining.    Each of the last two roundsof pay policy has been more flexible than its predecessor. Therigid  6 round was replaced by one with a guideline of 5 per cent,within a floor of  2.50 and a ceiling of  4.   This in turn gaveway to a guideline of 10 per cent.    In the 10 per cent round thekitty principle enabled negotiators to structure their settlementsir.whatever way suited their circumstances, and many used this flexi-bility.    In some cases it enabled the supplements outstandingfrom the previous two rounds to be consolidated into basic rates.    In others, it allowed larger percentage increases to be given to some than to others     within the same bargaininggroup - for example, to ease the compression ofdifferentials or to help the low paid.   The Government wishes tocontinue this trend towards greater flexibility.   But theGovernment cannot ensure that the flexibility it offers is fullyused:    this is the responsibility of employers and unions, who should shape their settlements in a way best suited to meetingtheir special needs.Productivity10. The Industrial Strategy is dedicated to increasing Britishindustry&apos;s share of home and overseas markets by improvingproductivity and competitiveness through higher investment and better use of our productive resources. By supporting investment projects under Section 8 of the Industry Act 1972, the Governmenthas made a major contribution towards improving the level and direction of investment in British manufacturing industry. Butthe evidence from the Sector Working Parties shows also thatmajor improvements must be made in the way industrial assets are used. Pay policy has a role to play in achieving these
(secret;improvements.   First, the flexibility provided by the kittyprinciple makes it possible to adjust pay structures withinthe overall limit to meet changing technological requirements.Secondly, in the current pay round there have been examples ofmarked increases in productivity through self-financingproductivity deals.     The Government has therefore decided tocontinue providing for such deals in the next round, on thesame conditions - that any deal of this nature should neverincrease unit labout costs and wherever possible should reducethem. It must be demonstrated to be self-financing before any payments are made, and payments should continue only if regularchecks confirm that it is still self-financing.   The savingsgenerated by such deals should be shared between the workers,the enterprise, and consumers, so that they may contribute towards the cost of other pay increases, assist investment andrestrain prices.Settlement dates11. Responsible collective bargaining must preserve an orderlypattern of settlements through the maintenance of existingpractices as regards the date of settlements.12. For these reasons the Government looks to those concernedwith pay determination in the public and private sector to respecttheir existing annual settlement date.     There may be an exceptional case v/here there is a special reason for change.If so, negotiators should adjust the overall level of theirsettlement to take account of any costs involved in moving tothe new settlement date.Hours13. Much attention has been focussed on the possibility of reducing working hours and the contribution this could make to increasing job opportunities.   The Government welcomes the recentTUC initiative on the reduction of overtime working. there appears to be significant scope - particularly in those areasof employment in which overtime has recently increased substantially - for additional jobs in substitution for overtime
(secret)working at no increased cost.    There could also be scope for reduction in working hours without loss of individual earningswhere revised shift arrangements or other working practices make possible additional job opportunities with a corresponding increase in output, and overall unit costs are not increased.In many areas industrial plant is less intensively and effectivelyused in the United Kingdom than in some competing countries,and moves in this direction could contribute towards the high-income, high-output, high-employment economy which is our objective.The introduction to this White Paper has emphasised theimportance of our unit costs, particularly labour costs in relationto productivity, by comparison with those of other countries,and the question of hours generally is an important element in thesecosts.    If more people were employed to produce the same outputwithout any reduction in individual earnings, labour costs would inevitably be that much higher.   The consequent price increases would reduce sales and lead to unemployment unless our maincompetitors in home as well as overseas markets were adoptingsimilar changes.   The Government has indeed taken the initiative in discussions within the European Community to encourageparallel moves, but must emphasise the dangers for the UK in increasing costs through reductions in hours in advance of our competitors.15.    In general, therefore, the Government can accept a reductionin hours as part of a normal pay settlement on condition thatit is demonstrated that the settlement as a whole does not leadto any increase in unit costs above what would have resulted from a straight guideline settlement on pay.     Indeed thecost of any improvement in conditions of employment such asholidays, hours and fringe benefits must count towards the levelof settlements - subject to the same exceptions as in thecurrent round for improved pensions, sick pay, job security, etc.- save in so farasany cost involved is offset by increased productivity,..in which case this, must be subject to regularchecking like other productivity deals.6(secret)
(secret)Growth in earnings16. The Government has an inescapable responsibility to indicate the level of growth in earnings which it considers to be appropriate for the coming pay-round and consistent withpreventing an increase in the rate of inflation.    It is itselfdirectly or indirectly involved in pay bargaining for the public sector - some 30 per cent of the labour force - and it has over-riding responsibility for the economic welfare of the nation as awhole.      It would be neither fair nor practicable for the Governmentto 3et a guideline for earnings growth in the public sector and leave the private sector subject only to the constraint of marketforces.      Britain has a highly structured and interlocking wagesystem, each section of which has repercussions on others. these considerations make it necessary for the Government to giveguidance for the whole economy.17. The growth of earnings in the whole economy over the comin&quot;:year must enable us to consolidate the success already achieved in reducing the rate of inflation.     Earnings make up the major part of labour costs, which in turn account for about half ofthe cost of production in the United Kingdom.      Increases in earnings which are not offset by improved productivity aretherefore likely to raise prices.      Moreover other production costs, such as imported materials, machines and semi-manufactures,are highly dependent on the value of the   sterling v/hich in turn reflects the rate of inflation in Britain relative to thatin other countries.      We cannot expect, during 1979, the advantageswe enjoyed in 1978 as the result of earlier reductions in labour costs and previous increases in the value of sterling. Iflabour costs continue to increase at their present rate, the combination of all these factors would result in the level of inflation beginning to rise again.18. Living standards have been improving substantially over recent months,when take-home pay for most people has increased much faster than prices.7(secret)
(secret)Taking account of all the fiscal changes from last October onwardsfor a family with two children under eleven, mother rot working andfather earning  75 a week the fiscal changes alone v/ill provide anincrease in net income of some 6.1 per cent, rising to 8.5 per centwhen the Child Benefit increase comes in during November.    For thesame family where the father earns  50 a week, the increase is greater;    8.1 per cent up to the Child Benefit increase, when itrises to 11.3 per cent.    For a married couple, wife not working,the fiscal changes are worth *J. 9 per cent if the husband earns  75 aweek and 6.6 per cent if he earns  50 a week.19-    In these circumstances the Government1s duty is to advocate apolicy which provides the best possible foundation for a further reduction in inflation, an increase in jobs and output, and an improved standard of living.    To achieve that end settlements in thecoming year (apart from those exceptions described in otherparagraphs of this White Paper) should be such as will not, on thebasis of past experience, lead to a total increase from all sources in average earnings of the group concerned, and other costs requiredto be taken into account, of more than 5 per cent as compared withthe previous year.Lower Incomes20. Although families on low incomes will benefit significantly fromthe general reduction in the rate of inflation, the Governmentrecognises their special needs.    However, the recent report of theRoyal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth showed that only some 40 per cent of lower incomes families have income fromearnings.    For those dependent on State benefits, the arrangementsalready in force ensure that these benefits are protected against inflation, and in some cases are increased in real terms.    To help the lowest earners, however, the Government would see no objectionif the minimum rates prescribed by statutory Wages Councils were tobe increased by rather larger percentages where relatively smallcash sums were involved.    The Government expects those on higherearnings in the same or other industries to accept the consequentialrelative improvement in the position of the lov/est paid.Exceptional Increases21. The pay policies of the past three years have inhibited tovarying degree the adjustment of internal pay structures and external0(secret)
(secret)pay relativities that would otherwise have occurred.    However, even where desirable, such adjustments must not be allowed to promoteleap-frogging claims.    Where they are absolutely necessary the flexibility which is provided by the provisions in this White paper and which was largely present in the previous guidelines - notably the ability for negotiators to adjust internal pay structures withinthe overall limit on increases for the group or groups concerned -offers an effective means for dealing with many of them progressively.This flexibility should be increasingly used for this purpose.22. Nevertheless, the Government has recognised in a small numberof cases based on the recommendations of an independent body -firemen, police, the Armed Forces, others covered by Review Bodies,and university teachers - that some exceptional increase is needed.The pay of the groups concerned is traditionally determined verylargely by external comparisons and this process was interrupted bythe introduction of the  6 policy in July 1975-    In each case thenecessary increase has already been identified and quantified on thebasis of independent recommendations, and the balance over and abovethe guidelines increase in the current round is to be paid int wo stages on the next two annual settlement dates for the groupsconcerned. Each stage is estimated to result in an increase in theAverage Earnings Index (new series) of the order of 0.15 per cent.23. It may be that there are a smaller number of groups in asimilar position for whom like treatment might be appropriate whenthey reach their settlement date, but few groups will legitimatelyqualify for treatment of this sort.    If so, there must be priorclearance through the Department of Employment, or sponsor departments for public sector groups.    Such clearance will normally be given only if the pay for the group concerned has traditionally been determinedby external comparisons with the pay of other groups doingcomparable work requiring comparable degrees of skill;    and if the objective application of such comparisons shows that the traditionalrelativities have been interrupted by the introduction of the 6 policy in July 1975._9_(secret)
(secret)The public sector2i\.    The Government will ensure that full account ij?taken of the guidance in this White Paper tliroughoutthe public sector.   The cash limits for 1978-79 have already been published in Cmnd7161  and no general changes in them are plannedas a result of this White Paper.    For 1979-80 the assumptionsused for the cash limits will reflect the Governments policy on pay.The private sector25. In the private sector the Government relies on employers and unions to act responsibly and moderately, as the CBI and the TUChave given assurance they will.    In the light of these assurancesthe Government trusts it will not be necessary to use itsdiscretionary powers in support of the guidelines. However,these powers will still exist and they will be used if necessary.The pay clauses in existing Government contracts will remainin force, and they will continue to be included in new contracts.The Remuneration, Charges and Grants Act, 197326. The provisions of the Remuneration, Charges and GrantsAct 1975 expire on 31 July 1973 and the Government does not propose to seek their renewal.     It is recognised that in somecases observance of the guidelines in this White Paper mayconflict with existing contractual obligations.   This should,however, be much less widespread in the coming pay round thanin the past three years.   Where such cases arise it is opento the parties concerned to make the necessary modificationsby mutual arrangements and the Government would expect themto do so. The provisions of Section 1 of the Act are therefore nolonger required.Prices and Dividends2 7.   The Government regards continuing price control as animportant part of the Attack on Inflation.    The Price CommissionAct 1977, which has been in force since last August, replaceda detailed and inevitably inflexible Price Code related to10(secret)
(secret)additional coats with a policy under which the Price Commissionreports selectively on individual companies and industrieswhose pricing prima facie justifies investigation.   We arenow seeing the results of this new policy.28. Between August 1977 and June 1978 the Price Commissioninitiated 2k investigations into pricing by individual enter-prises, of which 18 have been completed.    In 15 of these theprice increases sought were wholly or partly restricted duringthe investigation;    and in 9 case3 prices are being held orrestricted for   various    periods after the investigation. Atthe same time action has been taken to follow up Price Commissionexaminations of sectors of industry.    This has led to reductionsor restrictions in the prices of tea, coffee, and beer.    In the nationalised industries, as elsewhere, price increases have beenfar lower than for several years. Rebates worth  100m havebeen returned to telephone subscribers.   No major increases areexpected in nationalised industry prices for the remainder of thisyear.29. Over the coming months the Price Commission will maintain an active programme of investigations into individual companies,and will also examine, at the directionofthe Government, pricingpractices in different sectors of industry.    In addition, thevery existence of the Price Commission   encourages companies to examine carefully the justification for price increases.Companies may be induced to withdraw or reduce notifiedincreases so as to avoid investigation.   All this in turninfluences leading competitors, suppliers and trade customersof the enterprise concerned.   At the same time the price commission is required by law to discharge its functions in a way which takes account of other objectives in our national economic policy.    The Commission must have regard, among othermatters, to the promotion of new investment and technologicalinnovation, the encouragement of industrial efficiency, theappropriate level of profits and dividends and the interestsof consumers.   Thus the Commission not only has a duty to identify excessive price increases and to recommend the stepsneeded to correct them, but also in doing so to take full account11(secret)
of the wider economic background against which such price increases are put forward.30. [Dividends to follow].Conclusion31. If moderation is not exercised in the coming round inflationis certain to increase, with consequences for confidence andthe exchange rate which would be highly damaging to our economy.The Government could not stand aside in such circumstances. Itwould be obliged to take fiscal and monetary action to remove the fuel from inflation.    Such action would inevitably have serious effects on output.    A large number of companies couldbe expected to go bankrupt;    there would be a substantial increasein unemployment;    and there might well be a step change to a^lower level of economic activity from which it would be difficultto recover.    This is an unappealing course, which the Governmentwould follow with extreme reluctance.    But it would have no choiceif the alternative was a return to the spiralling inflation of197^-75; for that would be even more damaging to output andemployment and would also offer no hope of escape in the future.Rising inflation would bear particularly hard on those sections ofthe community which are least able to defend themselves.32. The guidelines set out in this White Paper offer a far better course - the opportunity for pay negotiators to use their freedom in     reaching settlements with responsibility and moderation,to consolidate the success of the last three years.    They can do so with confidence that this will build solid foundations for economic growth.    It will encourage the regeneration of industry, guarantee the living standards of working people and make possible a continuing fall in unemployment, bringing lasting benefits to all sections of the community.12A(secret)
