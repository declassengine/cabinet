(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)SECRET&apos;CP. (46) 4166th. November ,  1 946COPY NO.CABINETINTERNATIONAL ORGAN I SATIONSMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council1. The President of the Board, of Trade, in hismemorandum on the Site of the International TradeOrganisation (CP. (46) 413).  touches on some importantquestions going beyond the immediate scope of his paper.I feel that in considering his conclusions it would bevaluable to take into account the wider background,particularly since the Foreign Secretary according to&quot;The Times&quot; has uttered a notv of warning in an interviewimmediately after his arrival in New York, when he saidthat &quot;The United Nations would do well not to try toaccomplish too much too quickly.      It should do what  itcould as thoroughly as possible rather than try to solvethe problems of humanity.&quot;2. The current mushroom growth of internationalorganisations and the expansion of their agenda suggeststhat they are working on the dubious principle that themore international problems are tackled at once the moresuccess is likely to be attained.      The only other obviousexplanation is that the growth and agenda of these bodiesare getting out of hand and that the attempt to maintainsome sense of proportion and of priorities is being defeated,by the ease with which any vociferous, group in any countryinterested in any subject can secure the creation of aninternational organisation to enshrine its ideals,  or at thevery worst can secure a separate commission or sub-commissionof U.N.O. dedicated to the causes which it holds most dear.3. I propose, therefore,  that our spokesmen should gosomewhat further than the President of the Board of Trade&apos;suggests and that they  should seize every opportunity ofimpressing on all concerned that:-(a) There are certain tasks in front of theUnited Nations on which their success orfailure and the winning or losing of peacewill depend in the fairly short run;notably the peace  settlement,  the creationof military and political security,  andthe creation of world, economic  order.If  these tasks are not successfully completedwithin a comparatively short time allother successes of U.N.O.  - like thesuccess of the League in dealing with thewhite slave traffic and the trade inharmful drugs - will be pointless.

(b) The trained and effective man-power availableat all levels, Ministerial and official,for these vital priority tasks is dangerouslysmall.      The more inessential or secondaryproblems are forced on the internationalagenda,  the more man-power and. otherresources.are dissipated from the toppriority problems and the more risk thereis that these top priority problems willnot be solved in time.(c) Both the  central organisation of the UnitedNations and the organisation of itsspecialised agencies are full of graveweaknesses,   some of which the Presidentof the Board of Trade has pointed out. -A high proportion of the staffs are pre-occupied with personal, financial and otherdifficulties due to the choice of the mostexpensive spot on earth as headquarters andthe continual removals with consequentialhousing and other difficulties for allconcerned.      The number of top rankadmininstrators who have so far joined thestaffs of U.N..O.  or its specialised agenciescan be described without fear of exaggerationas very small indeed.      Those internationalofficials who are struggling with theseproblems, and who cannot be adequatelyreinforced owing to the lack of man-power inthis and other countries,  should be protectedagainst an agenda which raises everything andtherefore can solve nothing..     They should begiven more opportunity to consolidate andperfect their own machinery, which ideallyshould work with something like the smoothnessand efficiency of our own Cabinet Secretariat.U.   m -       The results so far of locating the Pood and AgricultureOrganisation in the United States have been most disappointing.The progress registered by the F.A.O. beyond the point reachedat the Hot Springs Conference as long ago as 1943 isremarkably small,  and officials who cannot safely be sparedfrom tackling, the still urgent problem of world famine areonce more pulled away to Washington for long discussionsabout a hypothetical World Food Board while the InternationalEmergency Food Council, which might do something to meet thereally important problems of this and next crop year,  isapparently being allowed virtually to fade out.5. Difficult as it is for us to find the necessaryman-power and contributions for this welter of internationaldiscussionsj^-rt is obviously far more difficult for thesmaller countries, whose few available economic andadministrative experts are kept flying up and down the worldinstead of putting their own countries in order.      Thisclearly must and does react on the speed of domestic recoveryin the countries concerned, which could produce more food,more materials and more economic stability and progressgenerally,  but for this factor of absentee administration.-We coula, therefore,  expect widespread support in taking astand for more concentration on essentials and in fact if

-    174such a atand is not taken soon there is grave danger that theUnited Nations Organisation may fall into discredit as amere talking-shop to which a number of countries will notbe prepared to  send their best men.6. I would:,   therefore, propose  that  in addition tokeeping the site question open, as suggested by thePresident of the Beard of Trade in paragraph 8 of CP. (1+6) h13,the Cabinet should also (subject to the Foreign Secretary&apos;sviews):-(i) Urge on the United Nations more concentrationon essentials for the critical period ahead.(ii) Invite Ministers to use every possible effortto minimise the number of questions notof strategic importance for winning thepeace which are to be placed on the agendafor international discussion, at least tillthe end of 19L.7.(iii) Take all possible  steps to ensure priorityfor the discussion of,  and provision ofman-power and other resources for,  the mostvital problems of international securityand international economic recovery andorder.H.M.Office of the Lord Presidentof the Council.6th November,  19h6.
