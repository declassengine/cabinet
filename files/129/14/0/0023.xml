IfllS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)JggSECRETCP. (46) 42315th November,  19U6COPY NO.CABINETPROPOSABS FOR SUPPLYING INDUSTRY WITH FUELDURING- THE WINTERMemorandum by_the Minister of Fuel and Power1.. As arranged at yesterday&apos;s Cabinet (CM. (46) 96thConclusions, Minute 5)  I have prepared the present papersetting out my proposals for supplying industry with fuelduring the coming winter.2. First of all let us be quite clear about the presentposition.      Total weekly output of coal is now running atabout 3.9 million tons or 1 per cent, higher than a yearago.      So far so good.      But consumption today is runningat a rate of 4.8 per cent,  above that of twelve months ago.Thus the increase in consumption has more than offset thegain in production.      We are therefore faced with thelikelihood that total supplies this winter will fall shortof total requirements by something between 2 and 5 milliontons.      The situation is aggravated by the breakdown in thetransport of coal by rail which has already led to a curtail-ment of output at a number of pits.3. The question which we have to ask ourselves istherefore not &quot;Shall any cuts be made in the supplies offuel to industry this winter?&quot;, but &quot;How shall  steps be takento secure that our fuel difficulties cause as littleinterference as possible with industrial activity?&quot;4. The plan agreed on the official level which Icirculated under cover of CP. (46) 4I9 was based upon theassumption that there would be differential cuts as follows:-(1) No tcut s for (a) iron and steel (including foundries),bl coke ovens,  (c) railways, canals and docks,colliery consumption, and (e) (for purelypractical reasons)  small users of coal who do notreceive a weekly allocation.(2) Cuts of only 3 per____   ^     cent. for certain high priorityindustries scheduled in the Annex to theOfficials&apos; Plan;     (The F.B.I.  have expressed theview that a cut of this size can be met by fuelefficiency without appreciable loss of output).(3) Gjuts-of12JLper cent.  for________^_______ all industries other thanthose included in (&quot;1 ) and (2) above.      (One-fifthof this cut would serve as a &quot;pool&quot; from whichassistance would be given on an ad hoc basis tomeet hard cases).

5. Since the scheme was drawn up,  certain of mycolleagues have indicated that they cannot accept the schemeas applied to their Departments.      This has inevitably ledother Ministers concerned to state that,  if exceptions areto be made for certain Departments,  they could not acceptthe scheme as applied to their own Departments.6. It must be realised that some plan is necessary,for otherwise we should be faced with exceptionaldifficulties after the turn of the year.      It is forMinisters to decide from what industries the necessaryeconomies shall be obtained.      If we take action now,  therewill be much less disturbance to industry than if we waitedtill the Pew Year when the required economies would have tobe found over a period of about 12 weeks instead of beingspread over about 21 weeks47. As I have already indicated^ I do not agree withcertain aspects of the Officials&apos; Plan, which I considershould be amended in the following respects:-GOAL(1) It would,  in my view, be a mistake to reduceweekly allocations as proposed in the Officials&apos;Plan, for this would introduce an element ofrigidity into the scheme which would be highlyinconvenient if later it were found possible toincrease the quantities which could be madeavailable to industry.      The existing practiceis that allocations are fixed for each industrialundertaking on the basis of its stated requirementsand that actual deliveries are based on the coalsupplies available.     &quot;This practice  should becontinued with the exception that,  as regardsthe non-exempted industries, deliveries would bereduced by  (a) 5 per cent,  and (b)  10 per cent.&apos; (instead of 12-g- per cunt,  as proposed in theOfficials&apos; Plan) according to the category inwhich the industries concerned are placed.      Eachfirm should be notified of  the extent to whichexisting deliveries are to be reduced,  so that thefirm may avoid running down its stocks unduly.(2) The  above modification of  the Officials&apos; Plan hasthe advantage that no public announcement needbe made.      I am strongly opposed to such anannouncement,  since it  is,  in my view,  quiteunnecessary and would be. calculated to have aseverely depressing political effect.GAS APD ELECTRICITY(3) The Officials&apos;  Plan for dealing with gas andelectricity was that a general Direction shouldbe issued to all industrial consumers requiringthem to reduce by 10 per cent,  the rate ofconsumption which they would have incurred if ithad not been for that&apos; Direction.     Their plan(which was suggested by the F.B.I.  in substitutionfor a scheme for limiting consumption to90 per cent,  of what was consumed in November)seems to me to offer no guarantee that anyeconomies would in fact be secured.      Moreover

no such scheme could possibly be  enforced inthe Courts.(a)  I am most anxious to secure  that there should beas little interruption as possible with gas andelectricity supplies and,  after reviewing the- position most carefully,  I have come to theconclusion that we may reasonably hope to supplythe necessary coal if we secure that gas andelectricity consumption does not rise above theaverage weekly consumption in November.(5) I accordingly propose that we  should issue a generalDirection to ail industrial consumers, other thanthose proposed (in paragraph h(1 ) of the presentpaper) to be given total exemption, requiring themto secure that their weekly consumption in thefour months December 19h6 - March 19h7 shall notexceed their weekly average consumption inNovember as recorded, in the first meter readingafter November.      The jjirection would alsorequire consumers themselves to take and recordmeter readings weekly and to keep such recordsavailable for inspection at  any time by officialsof my Departments.(6) A public statement of our decision in this matterwould be necessary but I see no objection to this:-(a) because public opinion is already aware ofthe dangerous heights to which consumptionof gas and electricity is rising and maybe counted upon  to  support a scheme designedto check further increases in this classof con sump t i on;(b) because part of the need for a gas andelectricity scheme arises not from coalshortages.but from the limitations imposedby shortages of plant.8. Hotels,  clubs and places of amusement:    The P.B.I.have represented strongly that,  if  the fuel supplies forindustry are to be cut,  there should be a similar cut forhotels,   clubs and places of amusement.      I agree with thisview, for many of these places are known to be- mostextravagant in their use of fuel.       I propose,  therefore,that deliveries of coal for them should be cut by 10 per cent,and also that thejr should be  subject to the proposedDirection as regards consumption of gas and electricity.9. Estimated economies obtainable:    I estimate thatthe modified scheme which I recommend would produce economiesbetween 1st December 19h6 and 30th March,  19U7S  amounting .to2,4-50,000 tons  (coal as a solid fuel,  1 ,600,000 tons;  coalfor electricity works, 650,000 tons;    coal x or gas works,200,000  tons).      This is considerably more than I should lookfor from the Officials&apos;  plan,   since,  as I have said,  thatPlan offers no firm prospect of securing a reduction of coal

by gas and electricity undertakings.      A saving of the ordersuggested above would go a long way towards closing thepresent gap between anticipated supplies and anticipatedrequirements and would do so on an equitable basis and withthe least interference to our general economy.E.Ministry of Puel and Power,7, Mi1lb ank,  S.W.1.15th November,  1946,
