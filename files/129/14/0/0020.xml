DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT)SEC R,IjJTQ.P. ( .c)  h-201 2th November,  1 9lj6.CABINETTP^NSPORT^ILLMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council1* In view of the short time available, the Ministerof Transport&apos;s memorandum (C. P. (1+6) i+08)  covering the draftTransport Bill was circulated- simultaneously to the Cabinet andto the Socialisation of Industries Committee.      The Committeehave examined the questions raised in the Minister&apos;s memorandumand have gone through the draft Bill:    and it may be of assistanceto other members of the Cabinet to have a short summary of theconclusions we reached.2. On the questions specifically raised in the Ministerof Transport&apos;s mem or an dura, our recommendations are- briefly asfollows:-Clause 18:      The Minister of Transport proposes,  shortlybefore the introduction of the Bill,  to send- a confidential letterto the railway and. canal companies warring them againstunjustified death-bed. dividends.      Ho should be authorised,  as heproposed,  to say in Parliament that,  if unjustified dividends aredeclared before the Bill is passed,  the Government would introducea clause authorising reduction of the compensation payable to thestockholders who had. benefited.Clause 22 necessarily raises,  on the acquisition - of a singlemunicipally owned canal,  the general question of the compensationto be paid to local authorities whose undertakings are taken overunder socialisation legislation.      The basis of compensationproposed is net outstanding liabilityThere may be pressureto make concessions to preserve the position of local authoritieswhich have derived, revenue in aid. of rates from their undertakings.Such concession would, be open to the objection that it wouldreward the improvident local authority who has aided the ratesrather than  paid, off debt or financed new development fromrevenue-;    further, many local authorities have subsidisedundertakings from the rates and are being relieved of a liability.We are not in favour of any concession on this score;    nor,  atthis stage,  of any compensation for severance.Clause 28:      Where transferred property is subject tomortgage compensation should be paid, to the encumbrancer who haspriority.Glauses 83 to 8.5:      The Chancellor of the Exchequer hasagreed.&apos; that there should not be any specific &quot;charge&quot; on theCommission&apos;s undertaking for any of the sums for which theCommission &quot;becomes liable.      This also disposes of the question,which the Minister of Transport raises, whether the localauthorities should, have any priority in respect of amounts theyreceive for net outstanding debt.COPY NO.\S9&apos;

h. In    regard to the fixing of transport charges theBill provides that the Commission should send to the Minister3 statement of the principles on which they consider thecharges should Be based.      The Minister then refers theprinciples to an ad hoc Charges Advisory Committee and theCommittee is to held, a public enquiry with interested parties.Thereafter the Minister makes on order, which will be subjectto affirmative resolution in Parliament,  fixing the principleson v/hich charges are to be based end determining the functionof a Transport Tribunal which is to take the place of theRailway Rates Tribunal.This is a complicated piece of machineryf  and. itwould be difficult to say where final responsibility wouldrest for the fixing of transport charges.      If the Commissionfound itself in financial difficulties,  it might bo open to itto place the blame on Parliament, the Minister, the ChargesAdvisory Committee,  or the Transport Tribunal.      It is open toquestion whether Parliament is a suitable forum for settlingthe principles governing transport charges.Clause 90:    There is some danger in a specific provisionenabling the Minister to relieve the Commission of the costof unremunerative works.      The clause should ho omitted fromthe Bill;    end the manner in which the cost of unremunerativeworks required by Departments should be shared, betweenDepartments and the Commission can be settled on individualcases as they arise.Clause 97:    No provision should be made for compensationfor worsening of conditions leading to resignation,  and theclause should he shortened since it has now been agreed-withthe Trades Union Congress General Council that the detailsof schemes should ha dealt with by regulation,  other than apoint as to existing statutory rights.Comoensation C1 auses:    as proposed by the Minister, ahaulier whose long distance assets are taken over at hisoption should receive,  in addition to the current value of theassets,  payment for severance but no payment for goodwill.Private wagons should be taken over on terms of cost atAugust 1939 for wagons built up to that date end original costfor wagons build thereafter;    in both cases subject todeductions for depreciation.3- The Committee,  in the course of its examinationof the draft Bill, formed, conclusions on a number of pointsof which the following are the -more important: -(a) In view of the precedent of the Coal Bill,qualifications for membership of the Commissionshould be set out in Clause 1  on the lines ofthe words at present shown in square Bracketsin sub-section (2).(b) The hotel industry should- he given a lead by aprogressive polio;/ in regard to railway hotelsand restaurants and it is accordingly do-air- bioto set up a  separate Hotels Executive in respectof the railway hotels, restaurants and restaurantcars.      The Hotels Executive should be referredto by name in sub-section (3)  of Clause 5*(c) The Minister, in setting up Consultative Committeesunder Clause 6, should be under a statutoryobligation to consider the special needs ofScotland and hales.

As a piece of machinery, it would be simpler topiece on obligation on the Commission to settle both theprinciples end the charges based on these principles,  possiblywith c provision that the Commission should have regard toadvice given to it by an Advisory Committee constituted onthe lines of the proposed Charges advisory Committee.      Aggrievedtransport users could, then bring any grievances against theCommission-&apos; s charges before a Transport Tribunal.The Minister of Transport is of opinion that,  inview of post legislation on the subject of railway charges,  itis unlikely that transport users would, be prepared to leave thefixing of charges entirely to the discretion ox the Commission,even with the safeguards indicated,  and he believes that traderswill wish c Transport Tribunal to be set up on the lines of thepresent Railway Rates Tribunal with wide powers to fix chargeshaving regard to the estimated expenditure of the Commission.He also believes that Parliamentary approval of the principleson which charges should be fixed is inescapable.These questions raise a number of fundamental issues:-(a) V/hother the Commission should be left withresponsibility to fix both the principles governing chargesand the detailed rates.(b) Whether,  in the framing of the principles,  ticMinister should be authorised to intervene so as to secure theimplementation of Government policy,  e.g-.,  the giving of specialmates to development areas, new towns or particular industries.(c)Isubject toWhether theParliamentaryprinciplesoooroval.governing charges should, beThe Committee agreed -(i)        That,  however the responsibility for determiningthe principles governing charges is distributed,it should be borne in mind at ell stages that theCommission must pay its way,  arid that provisionsto make this clear should be introduced into theBill.(ii)        That the legislative provisions should be so framedas to ensure that there is more    or less completefreedom to adopt the machinery for the detailedfixing of charges which, on further consideration,appears to be best suited to the needs of transportusers and. the Commission.      The general feelingwas, however, that in no circumst:nces shouldparliament be con corned with actual charges andthat the Minister should probably not have anyresponsibility in regard to the fixing of charges.H.M,ivy Council Office,  S.W.1.12th Nov emb or,  19p6 B
