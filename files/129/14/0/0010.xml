^IS document is the property of his britannic MAJESTY&apos;S goyernmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1948[SECRET Copy No.C.p. (46) 410list October, 1946CABINETEXCHANGE CONTEOL BILLMemorandum by the Solicitor-GeneralI think it right to draw the attention of my colleagues to certain features)f the above Bill. It is much more drastic than any Act which at present formspart of our legislation, but at the same time it is designed to be watertight inIts operation and would be useless if it does not achieve this purpose. I have[with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his advisers examined each Clause,and a very strong case can be put up with regard to each Clause in its present&quot;orm that anything less drastic would be ineffective.2.   I set out some examples to show the drastic nature of the Bill : (a) Clause 4 provides, inter alia, that &quot; except with the permission of theTreasury no person shall .... in the United Kingdom .... makeany payment to or for the credit of a person who is resident outsidethe scheduled territories.&quot; This Clause would make it an offence topay a bus fare for an American friend or to pay bridge winningsto an American friend in this country. Clause 1, sub-section 2,provides that &quot; A person shall comply with such conditions as to theuse to which &quot; foreign currency &quot;may be put as may from time totime be notified to him by the Treasury.&quot; This enables the Treasuryin the case of the  75 that a tourist is able to export, to say preciselywhat he is to do with it; for example, that he must not purchasesouvenirs or expend it in any particular way, e.g., in buying theliterature of a particular political party.(b) Clause 41 (5) provides that &quot; the obligations and prohibitions imposedby this Act shall .... apply to all persons notwithstanding thatthey are not in the United Kingdom and are not British subjects, inother words, to anybody in any part of the world. Paragraph 1 ofPart II of the Fifth Schedule provides that &quot; any person in or residentin the United Kingdom who contravenes any requirement imposedon him by or under this Act . . . .&quot; shall be guilty of an offencepunishable under the Act. Clause 40, sub-section 2, provides that&apos;&apos; the Treasury may give directions declaring that for all or any of thepurposes of this Act a person is to be treated as resident or notresident in such territories as may be specified in the directions.&quot; Thecombination of these sections leads to the result, on their strict readingin any event, that an American subject in America is liable to complywith the requirements of the Act, and the Treasury are given power todeclare that any such person is resident for the purposes of the Act inthe United Kingdom, with the result that he could be prosecuted if heshould come to this country in the event of his having in the UnitedStates failed to comply with any provision of the Act. The effect ofthis may be considered in connection with Clause 1, sub-section 1,which provides, inter alia, that &quot; no person resident in the UnitedKingdom other than an authorised dealer shall outside the UnitedKingdom buy or borrow any gold or foreign currency from, or sell orlend any gold or foreign currency to, any person other than anauthorised dealer.&quot; An American, therefore, who lent a milliondollars in the United States to a person other than an authorised[32632]I
dealer could theoretically, if the Treasury had given a direction withregard to him that he should be deemed to be resident in the UnitedKingdom, be prosecuted in respect of this loan. He could then, underPart II of Schedule V, paragraph 1, sub-paragraph 3, be prosecutedsummarily and imprisoned for not more than three months and fined 500. He could also by the Court of Summary Jurisdiction be orderedto forfeit the million dollars,(c) Clause 6 provides that &quot; no person resident in the United Kingdom shalloutside the United Kingdom make any payment to or for the credit ofa person resident in the scheduled territories .... in associationwith .... the acquisition by any person, of property which is out-side the scheduled territories.&quot; Theoretically, if an American in theUnited States paid to his broker a million dollars to acquire Americanshares for his wife he would be liable, if the Treasury had given adirection that he and his broker should be regarded as resident inthis country, to be prosecuted summarily under the Act if he shouldcome to England.3. The instances given are, of course, theoretical in the sense that they arepossible if the Treasury exercise their powers unreasonably. On the other hand,cases are bound to arise in which the Treasury may desire to go to some lengthsin this direction. The control cannot operate unless the Treasury have a powerto control the transactions of Americans who, for example, spend part of theirtime in this country and part of their time abroad, e.g., questions might arisewith Americans who spend part of the year in Scotland, or American businessmen who frequently travel between the United States and this country. It is,of course, always possible that foreign countries may retaliate by passing legisla-tion which would give them similar powers over British subjects.4. Many clauses in the Bill are of necessity moreover purposely phrasedin such a way as to be wide in their scope, with the result that there must beconsiderable uncertainty as to their effect. I have already mentioned the words&quot; in association with &quot; in Clause 6. Clause 11 is a further example. It provides,&apos;&apos; Except with the permission of the Treasury no person resident in the UnitedKingdom shall do any act which is calculated to secure, or forms part of aseries of acts which together are calculated to secure, that capital moneys payableon a security registered in the United Kingdom are paid outside the UnitedKingdom.&quot; It would be difficult to predicate in a great many cases whetherany act comes within this description.5. I call attention to the above features of the Act because, quite apartfrom the protest which its stringency will call forth from the Opposition andthe Conservative Press, the Courts will not like this type of legislation and willattempt to whittle it down. Moreover, in the House of Lords there may bevery determined opposition to it. I have, however, examined it clause by clausewith the experts on exchange control in the Treasury and I feel that they doestablish their case that anything less stringent would not meet the purposeintended to be achieved, and indeed would be useless and easy to circumvent.Personally, therefore, whilst there are amendments in detail which I feel weshould concede in Committee, I am prepared to defend the Bill in the Houseof Commons, since I feel nothing less will be adequate to accomplish the obviouslynecessary purpose of the Bill. The White Paper which I understand is to bepublished should, I think, be very explicit as to the manner in which it isproposed that the Treasury will operate the Bill.F.
