The Ministry state,that if they were to allocate to the iron and steelmore than about 4,800,000 tons of other coal,  thiswould mean increasing the proposed cut on the rest of industryby some 2;t.aowever,industryThe fuel requirement figures quoted in the precedingparagraph are based on an assumed steel production ofingot tons a year:    the comparable pre-war peakfigure was 13?220,000 ingot tons a year.

The gap between steel requirements ana steel demand is,a very serious one, and there is no hope whatever of anyimprovement in the import position before the later months of19l(.7*      The shortage of steel will certainly have most seriouseffects on general production and transport, on the exportposition,  and on employment.      I therefore ask that,  inconformity with what I understand to be the general conclusionreached at the Lord president&apos;8 Committee on the 25th October,the iron and steel industry should be given the full requirementsneeded to achieve maximum &quot;production during the period up to the30th April next, notwithstanding the fact that this will involvea proportionately greater cut in the coal Supplies availablefor the rest of industry.JAW.Ministry of Supply,15th November,  1946,
