-    223DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) &apos;S E  ORE TC.P. (46)  4-50 &quot; COPY NO.19TH NOVEMBER,   194-6CABINETGIPT POOD PARCELS FOR OVERSEASMemorandum by the Minister1 of Food1.      The Cabinet last considered on 4th July the possibilityof relaxing the present ban on private individuals sendinggift food parcels overseas.      At that time Ministers weregenerally sympathetic towards the objects of the scheme putforward in CP. (46)  250, but decided that  its introductionwould have been inopportune at that time because the recentintroduction of bread rationing was arousing substantialopposition.    It was therefore agreed that my proposal shouldbe further considered, in the Autumn.2.      I feel that circumstances are now sufficiently changedto justify my again asking my colleagues to agree to therelaxing of the present ban as soon as the necessary - .&apos;.administrative arrangements can be made.      The position todayis that we have had to refuse, and must in my view continueto refuse,  all diversion of cereals supplies from thiscountry to the British zone in Germany.      On the;- other hand-,no-one would wish to minimise&apos; the dreadful conditions whichexist in the British zone in Germany.      No-one would wish todeny either the volume of human suffering whiah under-,nourishment through a German winter is producing,  and isbound, to produce,  nor - and this is an aspect which should,surely not.be overlooked - the serious political consequencesfor ourselves which may arise if we appear to do nothingwhatever to alleviate that suffering.    whatever we may thinkabout German responsibility&quot; and guilt,  it would surely bea profound political mistake to give the population ofWSstern Germany the impression, that we cared nothing abouttheir dreadful conditions and were unwilling to do anythingwhatever to help them.3.      In these  circumstances,  I urge my colleagues that itwould be a wise move from every point of view to permit thesending of parcels - under a carefully controlled scheme - fromindividuals in this country to individuals overseas,  and inparticular,  of course,  to individuals in Germany and Austria.It is true that we have been subjected to a certain amount ofagitation conducted, in a sentimental and sometimes evenhysterical manner on this issue, and this fact naturallytends  to put one off the proposal.      But it would,  surely, boa mistake to refuse to make a move for which there are soundpolitical as well as human grounds,   just because it hassometimes been advocated&apos; in a somewhat unreasonable way.

4.   .   This is the only thing which we can do in presentcircumstances - to help, without running criminally unjustifiablerisks with the food, of our own people.      It is true that theamount of food which can be sent in this way will be verysmall compared to the need.      It is rather the psychologicaleffect of the receipt by Germans of these parcels of foodcontributed by individual English men and women out of theirown rations to which I attach importance.      In this connectionwe must remember that parcels are now being sent from theUnited States to. Germany including the British Zone.    Of courseit  is an easy matter, tor American ind.ividu.als,  out of theirsuperfluity,  to send such parcels.    But  1 expect this isoften forgotten in Germany and unfavourable  contrasts between,us and the Americans are drawn.    If,  on the other hand, wepermit the sending of parcels,  we should, not omit  in our PressIand general publicity in Germany to point out that we aresending them out of our strict rations,  and that each British,parcel represents an incomparably greater sacrifice than do theAmerican parcels.5.      I do not think that there is any danger of individualsbeing persuaded by propaganda to send, more food than they canreasonably spare.    No doubt out of 45 million people theremay be individual fanatics and cranks who might do so, buttheir numbers would be quite inappreciable - nor would,the self-imposed under-nourishment of a few dozen cranks andfanatics be,  in my opinion,  any great disaster for this country.On the other hand,  there are households in this country with anappreciable surplus of rationed foods without denying themselvesadequate nourishment,  and I think it wrong to deny such peoplethe right to send -parcels if they so desire to do so.6.      Now as to the technical details of the scheme which Ipro-pose.     I understand that the resumption of parcels post  toall four Zones of Germany will bo discussed in Berlin by theQuadripartite Directorate for internal Affairs andCommunications on 22nd. November.      Assuming that they give adecision in favour of re-opening the parcels post,  then Iwould propose that the following arrangements should apply &apos;to all countries to which there is a postal parcels service;Pood parcels wou.ld.be permitted to be sent not morethan once a month by any individual in the UnitedKingdom to any individual in. the overseas countries,subject to the following cond.itions:(a) the contents to be limited to rationed foods,a detailed statement  of them to be put onthe parcel;(b) the weight of each parcel containing food tobe not more than 7 lbs.,  not more than 2 lbs.to consist of any one commodity;(c) all parcels to be unsolicited gifts,   a statementto that effect being put on the parcel by thesender.

7.      Similar arrangements could apply to the despatch offood parcels to members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces servingoverseas.8.      If no early resumption of a parcels post to Germanyis likely, the ahove arrangements could apply to othercountries hut special arrangements would he necessary forGermany.      I would then propose that  the Save Europe Moworganisation should he authorised to accept parcels limitedto one a month from individuals in this country and addressedto individuals for forwarding in hulk to Germany where theywould he injected into the domestic postal system.9.      Settlement of the administrative details involved shouldtake about two weeks from the date on which the policy isapproved in  principle.      I understand that the General PostOffice and the Army postal authorities would -prefer thatany scheme for food parcels did not come into effect untilafter the Christmas rush.      I am sure,  however,  that thosewho would he enabled to send parcels to their relatives andfriends will he anxious to do so in time for Christmas.I would therefore hope that it would not he necessary to delayits introduction.10.      The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, with whomI have consulted during the preparation of this memorandum,is in favour of the introduction of such a scheme at anearly date.J. S.Ministry of Pood.19TH NOVEMBER,   1946.
