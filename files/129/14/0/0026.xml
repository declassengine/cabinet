DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT) 208SECRET(46) 426COPY NO.1-8TH NOVEMBER,  1946CABINETREQUEST FOR BUTTER BY CADilJjAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Dominionsand the Minister of Pood1,     Mr.  Mackenzie King has made a very strong personal appealthat we will give our approval to enable the Canadian D^ojryProduce Board to purchase a minimum of 12 million lbs.(5,500 tons)   of butter from Australia and New Zealand,  inorder to prevent a temporary reduction, until April next,in the Canadian weekly butter ration from 6 oz.   to 4 oz,We are purchasing virtually the whole of the exportablesurplus from Australia (estimated at 50,000 tons)   andNew Zealand (estimated at 120,000 tons).2.     By dropping our butter ration to 2 oz.   for eight -weekswe shall, by 1st April,  1947,  have built up a stock ofiO, 000 tons  (i. e.  8-g- weeks&apos;  consumption at 5 oz.  - the figureto which the ration is to be restored on the 8th December).3.     The quantity which Canada wishes to obtain is equivalentto the amount which would be  saved by reducing our rationfrom 5 oz.  to 2 oz.  for four weeks.h*     There is no prospect of increasing the overall United Kingdomfat ration during 1947.    Whilst our butter ration has been2 oz.  a week,  the margarine ration, has been raised from3.,.oa. .  to 4 oz. ,   and will drop to 3 oz. when the butterration goes up.    The vegetable oil position is extremelydifficult and  it will be very hard indeed to maintain eventhe 3 oz.  ration over 1947.5.     Canada urges that her shortage of butter is due to thespecial efforts she has made to supply United Kingdom withcheese.    Against this it should be pointed out that,  ascompared with the Canadian 1946/47 contract of 56,000 tons ofcheese for shipment for the United Kingdom, not more thanJj-0,000 tons will be forthcoming.    This shortfall is the mainfactor which has prevented our restoring the normal 3 oz.  cheeseration for the 1946/47 winter.6&apos;     Canada&apos;s milk production in 1946 has fallen somewhat, butliquid consumption has risen.    In consequence the amountavailable for butter and cheese has fallen, but cheese hastaken the main cut.    Per the 9 months January/September,  1946,Canada&apos;s butter production has fallen f?% on last year, hutthe output of choose has declined, by 7.2.%9  the whole ofwhich has been borne by the United Kingdom.

7.      Canada has already made a direct approach to New Zealandfor the butter in question and has been refused on thegrounds of &quot;United Kingdom&apos;s urgent needs and New Zealand&apos;scontractual obligations&quot;0    Both Australia and New Zealandhave maintained their butter ration specifically in orderto meet the needs of the United Kingdom.    If we were totell those Dominions that we agreed to the diversion toCanada of some of our supplies,  they would, be very ecepticalas to the genuineness of our needs.    The abandonment ofbutter rationing in Australia and New Zealand wouldcost the United Kingdom over hOPQOO tons.    It will beremembered that when the recent arrangements were made forsupplying New Zealand butter to the U, 3.   forces there wasstrong antagonism in New Zealand, even though U.S.A..  hadpromised to supply United Kingdom with other fats inexchange;.8.      The considerations which, the Cabinet should takeinto account are:-(1)    Very strong representations which theCanadians have made in presenting theircase (see three telegrams from theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner atOttawa annexed.) -(2)    The question whether a reduction of ourbutter stocks as at 1st April next by5,503 tons from the h0,000 tons atpresent estimated would bring us belowthe safety level;(3)    The danger that reactions in Australia andNew Zealand through the diversion ofthis butter to Canada might imperil ourfuture supplies from those Dominions.J.

mmx  iFROM:      High Commissioner for The United Kingdom, OttawaTO: D.O.D. 15th November, 19U6R.    16th Novembers 19^6IMMEDIATEHo.  1621  SECRET AND PERSONALIn. course of ray talk with Prime Minister yesterdayevenings  he mentioned that,  owing to assistance given to usover cheese, Canadian Government are in a&quot;temporarydifficulty over butter,   and would have to reduce rationunless they could buy some from Australia and New Zealand(which, because of our contracts with those Dominionss  theycan only do with our consent).    prime Minister saidthat preliminary approaches to United Kingdom Governmenthad met with difficulty,  but he had instructed his peopleto press matter;,  and very much hoped that something couldbe done to tide him over.2.      Prime Minister said he knew our difficulties, buthe thought we would agree that Canada had done  all shecould to help us.    She would have all the butter shewanted, but for diversion to cheese exports for United Kingdom.3.      Prime Minister added in confidence that it would beparticularly unfortunate if Canadian Government had totake unpalatable action of reducing ration at a time whena by-election is pending in Quebec.    It was pretty clearthat,  in view of Government&apos;s losses in recent by-elections,this is what was really worrying; him.k%      It would,  I feel, pay a handsome dividend if it werepossible for him to be met in this matter.    Pood Missionhave already telegraphed to Ministry of Pood at requestof Canadian authorities,  see my telegram No.  1608

FPOM:     High Commissioner for the United Kingdom, OttawaTO: DA OAD.     17th November,  1946R.     17th    ,   &quot; &apos;       &quot;IMMEDIATENo.   1627    SECRETButter.Your telegrams Nos.  1526 and 1527 crossed my telegram1621.    Meanwhile there have been certain furtherdevelopments here which indicate not merely great importanceattached, by Canadian Government to their request, butthat matter has all the makings of a really serious issueinvolving very unpleasant political repercussions.2.      My immediately following telegram contains accountof discussion which Jones has had with Donald Gordon atlatter&apos;s request.    Gordon and Taylor are well known fortheir sympathetic attitude towards United Kingdom requirements,and have invariably afforded British Pood Mission allpossible    assistance in procurement.    Their advice andwarning thus gain added significance,  and we have to bear inmind too that Gordon will be Prime Minister&apos;s Chief Adviserin this matter.3.      There is no doubt a strong undercurrent of feeling herethat Canadians have gone so far to help us that we ought todo our very utmost to get them over this temporary difficulty,and avoid landing the Government in the extremely awkwardsituation which will otherwise ensue.    Conversely,  if wecannot do this,  Canadians will feel obliged to explain topublic that they approached us and -without success,  andin that event there might well be serious relaxing ofeffort on the part both of Government and producers, whichmight endanger fulfilment of 1947 agreements.4.      Moreover,  there is strong political aspect.    Conservativeopposition here has been bitterly critical of wheatagreement on the ground that Canada has been &quot;out smarted&quot;by us,  and there is no doubt that they would take the fullestadvantage of any cut in butter ration to press home attack onGovernment, who would again be accused of allowing UnitedKingdom interests to prevail over Canadian.    Pact thatGovernment have lost last three by-elections and oneis now pending in Quebec,  (which is a butter producing area)is bound to make them particularly sensitive on thisquestion,  and, unless we can produce very convincing figures,Prime Minister will almost certainly wish to take matterup himself at highest possible level.5,      Should be very grateful therefore if matter could beurgently reconsidered in light of above.    Canadians arepressing for-reply by Wednesday.    If it proves impossible tohelp,   it will,  I feel,  be essential that I should be inposition to give Prime Minister full, reasons,  supported byfigures setting out our own position in detail and coveringboth stocks and also foreseeable supplies and consumptionup to end April (interval before May being period to betided over).&apos; 1

AiNHEX    IIIFROM:      High Commissioner for the United Kingdom, OttawaTO: D.O.D.    17th November,  19h6R.     17th        &quot; &quot;IMMEDIATENo.  1628&quot;3E ORE TMy immediately preceding telegram. &apos; Butter.Yesterday Jones called on Gordon and Taylor ofw&quot;.P.T.B.   at their request.    In course of discussion onmaintenance of food exports to us,  they referred to buttershortage in Canada.    They stressed that this shortage wasin the main the result, particularly in Ontario and Quebecprovinces,  of the conversion into cheese to meet ourrequirements of milk which would otherwise have been used    -for manufacture  of butter.    Mention was also made ofwithdrawal of milk subsidies,  one purpose of which was toreduce consumption of fluid milk,  and. thus cause diversionof higher proportion of supplies to factories,2.      Gordon stated emphatically he would have to adviseGovernment that it would be impracticable effectively toadminister a h ounce ration,  because so small a rationwould, lose for thorn the support of the public  in theenforcement of control,  and thus facilitate black marketoperations, which,  with the public freely participating inthem,  the Board would find it impossible to suppress.    Healso referred to insurmountable distribution difficultieswhich would arise were the ration reduced below six ounces,which he observed was the weekly entitlement of butter andmargarine in the United Kingdom.    When reminded that theration had. previously&apos; been as low as four ounces,  Gordonremarked that  at  the  time of its introduction,  that wasin March,  the Government were in a position to assure thepublic that it would not remain at that figure for more thaneight weeks,&apos; where as,  if they have now to depend on available,stocks and home production,  the six ounce ration could notbe restored until the end of April next,  a period of fivemonths.    Taylor mentioned that when the reduced ration wasin force butter began to disappear from the legitimatemarkets and to be sold on the black market at exorbitantprices.3.      In short,   the point made by Gordon and. Taylor was,  thatthe considerations, which prompted the Government to withdrawsimilar application in February this year,  do not in theirjudgment apply in circumstances which now obtain.    Were theemergency likely to be one of short duration,   they wouldperhaps be prepared to advise their Government to allow theurgency of our needs to prevail,  but they feel that, havingregard to the cause of the shortage,  and to the fact thatrationing of certain foods has,  in the face of much criticism,been maintained to permit of our receiving the maximumpossible quantities of thorn,  the Canadian Government isjustified in expecting us to accede to its request forassistance to meet what is,  to the Government,   a reallyserious situation, politically and. otherwise.

h.      To repeat Gordon&apos;s word &quot;refusal of the requestwill be bitterly resented by the Canadian Governmentand. public,  and will be to play into the hands ofthe not inconsiderable section, which considersus selfish and inclined to regard Canada as asubordinate territory under an obligation to makefood supplies available to us&quot;.    Gordon alsoemphasised that, refusal will increase- the tendencyto hold back, for domestic consumption without anyregard for our requirements,  the full quantity neededto ensure free supply.5.      Gordon stated that the absolute minimum requiredfrom abroad to maintain the six ounce ration was12 million lbs.
