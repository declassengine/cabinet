(46) 40630ZA October, 1946CABINETCANADA IN 1946Memorandum by the Secretary of State, for Dominion affairs think that my colleagues will be interested to read the annexed notes byMr. Malcolm MacDonald entitled &quot; Canada in 1946.&quot; These notes, as he explainsin his opening paragraph, do not attempt to give a full-length picture of Canadabut represent rather a political sketch or personal summing up, based upon hisfive years&apos; experience as United Kingdom High Commissioner from 1941 to 1946.A.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,30th October, 1946ANNEXCANADA IN 19461. This is a political portrait of Canada, &quot; warts and all.&quot; It is not a full-length picture, but only a sketch, since those who study it will not wish to bebothered with much detail. For this reason it perhaps presents the situation inan over-simplified form.Canada&apos;s Size and Variety2. Geographically Canada is immense. Most people do not realise that itsland surface is considerably larger than that of the United States, althoughits population is less than one-tenth of that of the great Republic. within this area conditions and problems vary widely. Life in the charming butparochial Maritime Provinces, in the rich industrial cities of Quebec andOntario, on the vast agricultural prairie, amongst the fruitful valleys of theRocky Mountains, along the salubrious Pacific coast, and in remote pioneerlogging and mining camps &quot; in the bush&quot; presents many contrasts. Nor dopeople generally comprehend that the Dominion includes almost all the ArcticIslands and that one of the nation&apos;s problems is the adjustment of Eskimocommunities to the impact of white men&apos;s civilisation. It is not too late to savethat hardy and attractive but simple race from the humiliation and disasterwhich have overwhelmed the Redskins in North America. But sympathetic and active policies on Arctic health and education, which hardly exist at present,will be necessary to achieve this. In passing one may comment that the Canadianshave little right to criticise (if they are disposed to do so, which I doubt) our administration of Colonial territories so long as they have not solved satisfactorilytheir own Eskimo problem.3. Middle and Northern Canada remain comparatively undeveloped. It isa grand, solitary, untamed land where Nature is still almost completely undis-disturbed.   Hundreds of thousands of square miles are inhabited only by small,
scattered communities of white trappers, traders, missionaries and royal canadian Mounted Policemen, by tribes of hunting and fur-trading Indians, andby wandering Eskimo bands on the Barren Lands and the Arctic Islands. Other-wise the population consists of multitudes of caribou, moose, bears, foxes, beavers,muskrats, mink and other wild animals. Conditions are in some respects more modern, but otherwise not radically different from the days when this fur-trader&apos;sEmpire belonged to the Gentlemen Adventurers of England Trading into HudsonBay. Whether the territory will ever acquire a more sophisticated character isdoubtful. Perhaps bold innovations like the Alaska Highway and the ArcticAir Route will lead to economic exploitation. But, short of startling scientificdiscoveries connected with the growing of food, climatic and geological conditionsseem too harsh for agricultural expansion and the possibilites of developmentdepend mainly on how much mineral wealth is still locked up in the northernrocks. In a few places prospectors and miners are already scratching andtunnelling the earth with impressive success. At present the Yellowknife districtis enjoying a gold boom. Uranium deposits in the neighbourhood of Great BearLake may also prove even richer than was expected. But whether economic development will ever amount to much in the North as a whole is uncertain. Inany case the answer to that question belongs to the future.4, The vast majority of Canada&apos;s present population lives along a lengthyand comparatively narrow corridor of territory immediately north of the UnitedStates border. They total about 11,500,000 people. These are the young Canadiannation, the men and women whose contribution in food and munitions, air-training and ship-building, money and fighting, resolution and self-sacrifice gave suchpowerful aid to the Allied War effort and added so greatly to their own fame.The National Consciousness5. I have often marvelled that these people form a united, conscious and active nation at all. Canadian nationhood is by itself a notable achievement,for many factors might prejudice the position. Historically the citizens ofCanada between the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts have been joined together for only two generations; geograjDhically they are thinly spread along a strip of country stretching more than 3,000 miles; politically they are divided into ninedifferent Provinces each with its own government, Parliament and vested interests; whilst in race, religion and mother tongues they are marked by sharpvariations. These are all elements which could lead to discord, disunity and evennational disintegration. Yet the Canadians are not just a haphazard collectionof sectional groups. They are a people inspired by a national consciousness andpursuing national aims.6. Nevertheless, some of the divisions to which I have referred have a weakening effect. There is, for example, little love lost between some of theProvincial Governments. These nine separate Administrations together composea patch-work quilt of political party colours. Starting from the west coast andmoving to the east, the government of British Columbia is a Liberal-ConservativeCoalition, that of Alberta piously professes the dogmas of Social Credit and that ofSaskatchewan is actively Socialist. In Manitoba a Liberal-Conservative Coalitionadministration rules, in Ontario an undiluted Conservative Cabinet holds office,in Quebec the government is moved primarily by French-Canadian racial senti-ments and the governments of the three Maritime Provinces are all staunchlyLiberal. Apart from conflicts of policy between themselves some of these adminis-trations tend to quarrel for parochial or party reasons with the Federal Govern-ment presiding at the centre. The Conservative government of Ontario delightsin embarrassing the Liberal Government in Ottawa, the Socialist Government ofSaskatchewan is hardly less partial to scoring points over their party opponentsin the capital, and one of the favourite sports of the French cock in Quebec istwisting the supposed lion&apos;s tail in Ottawa. For rather different reasons manycitizens in British Columbia are ill-disposed towards the Federal Government.Situated 2,000 miles away, with the towering walls of the Rocky Mountains andthe huge stretch of prairie and forests separating them from it, they feel thatpoliticians in Ottawa fail miserably to understand their needs. Their contactslie south with their American neighbours rather than east with their Canadianfellow-countrymen and this situation tends to make their Canadian patriotismluke-warm.
7. Canada suffers, in fact, from the usual weaknesses of a Federation. Thiswas emphasised by the failure of the Federal and Provincial Governments inthe recent important Dominion-Provincial Conference to agree on a fresh adjust-ment of their respective powers. The Federal Cabinet proposed an extensionof their authority to meet the requirements of modern developments in govern-ment. Most of the Provincial Ministries were prepared to grant these, but thoseof Quebec and Ontario refused except on conditions unacceptable to Mr. mackenzie king and his colleagues.French and English8. The most serious clash in Canada, however, springs from racial causes.Different sections of the population have different national origins. In WesternCanada Ukrainian, Polish, German and other foreign-speaking communities areof increasing significance. But the most difficult and even dangerous division isthat between the Canadians born of French and those born of British stock.9. Those of French origin now compose almost one-third of the total population, whilst the British are less than one-half. The former, numberingabout 3,500,000, live almost wholly in the Province of Quebec and neighbouringareas. They, therefore, form a more or less concentrated French block in a large part of Eastern Canada. They and the English-speaking Canadians meet, knowand understand each other very little. This is due only in part to the circum-stance that geographically they mostly inhabit different parts of the country.There can be little inter-marriage between them because French-speakingCanadians are Roman Catholics whilst the others are generally Protestants.There is little social mixing because few of those of English stock trouble to learn French, the language of the home throughout French-Canada. There is little natural affinity between the two because in tradition, temperament andideas they are different creatures. Since Wolfe captured Quebec in 1759 prac-tically no immigrants have come from France, and the average French-Canadianis a peasant-farmer more akin to the Frenchman of pre-Revolutionary Francethan to the Frenchman of to-day. Indeed, French-Canadians as a whole havenever approved of the French Revolution. They are bound to the past by socialideas and religious institutions which the people of their mother country largelydiscarded in the bloody events which overwhelmed Old France thirty years afterNew France ceased to have a political connection with it. They are simple, con-servative, charming, song-loving people with sterling natural qualities; but theyare poor, badly educated and priest-ridden. The gulf in character between themand their English (and Scots) speaking compatriots is difficult to bridge. Thelatter have been too busy laying the material foundations of a new nation to enjoy much leisure and imbibe much culture. Distinctive Canadian literature,painting and music are only at their beginnings. But although the English-speaking Canadians are on the whole unscholarly and inartistic, they definitelybelong to the twentieth century, with up-to-date, forward-looking ideas oneconomic, social and political questions.10. These differences do not divide the best representatives of the two racesin Canada. In spite of the distinctions of language, tradition and religion manyof the leaders of both meet as intellectual equals, kindred spirits and naturalfriends. For example, they work together cordially as colleagues in the FederalCabinet. Yet, even so, they are distinct from each other. French-Canadianleaders have to express the general feelings of their racial followers, just as many English-speaking leaders must faithfully represent their section of thepopulation. And French-speaking Canadians as a whole have a &quot; chip on theirshoulder.&quot; They are a minority in a land where they were once masters; they still feel something of the bitterness of a defeat which took place two centuriesago; and they charge the English-speaking majority with depriving them of theirminority rights. Worse schooled than other Canadians, their young men andwomen often do not compete on an equality for high appointments in the professions, industry and Government service. Their comparative lack of successis often quoted as a grievance, French-Canadian extremists saying that it is a consequence not of the comparative merits of rival candidates but of deliberateracial discrimination. Many Roman Catholic priests exploit the naturalprejudice of their faithful, even subservient, flocks to foster dislike of theEnglish. As these priests are largely in charge of education in French-speakingCanada, they seize the opportunity to teach this hostility in the classrooms.
Their history text-books, for example, were for long full of misrepresentationsof British achievement and rule in Canada. All these causes have led to a deep-seated hostility in Quebec towards English-speaking Canadians. Modernenlightenment is beginning to dispel it, but the process will be slow.11. English-speaking Canadians must share the blame for this unhappystate of affairs. Many of them do not hide their contempt for the old-fashionedQuebecers and they make little effort to understand the &quot; habitant&apos;s &quot; point ofview. They refuse to make the concession of speaking French. Even the French-Canadians&apos; best friends in the other community do not bother to do this.Mr. Mackenzie-King is himself a remarkable example of this omission. It issurprising that, after being leader of the Liberal Party (which draws its mainsupport from Quebec) for more than a quarter of a century and the leader ofthe nation for nineteen years, he cannot conduct even an elementary conversationin the tongue whidh is native to a third of his fellow-countrymen and is, besides,one of the two official languages of the Dominion. The bridge of common speechhas to be built by the French-speaking Canadians. Many of them are bilingual.But they are sensitive and resent their fellow Canadians&apos; superior indifferenceto their beloved mother tongue.12. Hostility in English-speaking circles towards the French is aggravated by another consideration. As usually happens in such a situation, just as theFrench section of the population argue that their views are not taken into sufficientaccount by the English-speaking majority, so the latter assert that these views are heeded more than they deserve, that the French-speaking minority have too much influence. In this they are right and the French are wrong. For a longtime the Federal Government have been more sensitive to French-Canadianopinion than the numbers of French-Canadians and their contribution to thenational life strictly warrant. Yet political expediency demands this. Anyother course would provoke the French into violent protest which might evenlead to grave civil strife. This thought naturally does not appease the English.The fact that many of the hotter heads amongst them say openly that the issuecan only be settled by civil war and the military reconquest of Quebec show show explosive the situation might become.13. Much of this intolerance (so uncharacteristic of the British race as awhole) is really due to fear. The English-speaking Canadians know that, althoughthe French are a minority now, there is every likelihood of their becoming amajority later on. The French peasants abetted, if not aided, by their priests produce large families. Lusty, fertile and allergic to birth-control, their averagefamilies are two or three times the size of those of the English. They makelittle secret of their intention to achieve a French-speaking majority in canadian  God&apos;s good time. That is the reason why they oppose new immigration intoCanada.14. The consequences of all this are bad. At the best of times relationsbetween the two principal races are uneasy and suspicious. At the worst oftimes they flare into violent hostility. On such issues as conscription in warthe situation grows ugly and is in danger of reaching breaking point. I have written of that in despatches from Ottawa and need not dwell on it in this sketch.15. I have enlarged on this unsatisfactory state of affairs between the two principle racial communities because it is the central fact of Canadian national life. Its existence must be frankly recognised. Its significance can be exaggerated by alarmists, but it can also be underrated by wishful thinkers. Inmy opinion the situation is still profoundly disturbing. It is the Canadians&apos;first and most difficult domestic problem. No one from outside can do muchto help them solve it. They must work it out for good or ill themselves. Theinitiative is hardly likely to come in any large measure from the French-speakingCanadians. If and when Quebec&apos;s educational system become&apos;s better, the situa-tion will improve. But English-speaking Canadians could do much immediately to help. If they troubled to meet tJheir fellow-countrymen in French Canada,to converse with them in their own language, to explain to them the free andtolerant principles and practices of British and Canadian government, and todiscuss with them not their differences of race, religion and temperament but their common interests as Canadians, better relations would blossom.16. Fortunately the sense of common interests is steadily increasing. AsI have already emphasized, in spite of Provincial and racial differences, theCanadian people as a whole are moved by a sense of nationhood, a pride in
Canada, and a feeling that Canada has a noble mission to perform in the world.Even when the population was riven by the conscription issue during the warthis Canadianism found expression in a magnificent national war effort. I neednot expand on this, for it is known throughout the world. Canada&apos;s enhancedreputation and importance as a result of her agricultural, industrial, financial,military and diplomatic power in war will further stimulate national patriotism.IVlany of the ablest young men in public life are preaching it. Now that victoryhas been won and the wound which conscription always inflicts on the body politiclias begun to heal, the two races will tend to forget their differences and co-operatefor the greater power and fame of their country.The Inevitability of Compromise17. Certain weaknesses flow from the racial conflict. The need to try tokeep the two principal sections of the population more or less together leadsthe Government to make compromises in many departments of policy. Thesesometimes affect matters in which we in the United Kingdom are interested, suchas immigration, defence co-operation and the concert of our foreign policies. WeImust be forebearing and understand that these compromises are inevitable ifhead-on racial clash in Canada is to be avoided. The first duty in internal political affairs of any Canadian statesman worthy of the name is so to conductnational policy that the greatest possible measure of harmony is maintained between the English-speaking and French-speaking Canadians.Canada, Britain and the United States of America18. Canada&apos;s policy in external affairs is determined primarily by her relations with the United Kingdom on one side and the United States ofAmerica on the other. To both she is bound strongly by self-interest and senti-ment. The geographical, political and strategic reasons for this in each caseire obvious and need not be described here. Canada cannot afford to be estrangedfrom either her senior partner in the British Commonwealth of Nations or her3&apos;reat neighbour across her land frontier. If the Canadian Government conductedpolicy in a way which resulted in a serious breach with either of these Powers,tier security and influence in world affairs would be weakened and a damagingift would appear amongst her own people.19. For the same reason Canadians would be placed in an intolerableposition if any unpatchable quarrel arose between the Governments in Londonand Washington. If those two Governments ever fell out so seriously that thepanadian people had to choose between their friendship with the British andheir friendship with the Americans, they would be placed in a cruel dilemma.National opinion on the issue would be divided and whichever way the choicerent national unity would be severely strained, if not broken. Therefore, justthe first object of Canadian internal policy must be the promotion of:o-operation between the English-speaking and French-speaking Canadians, soie first object of Canadian external policy must be the maintenance ofo-operation between the United Kingdom and the United States of America.20.   Naturally the  Canadians  are  anxious  also  to  establish  friendlyelations with Russia.   Besides being one of the biggest Powers, Eussia, is aleighbour of Canada.   If war broke out between Russia and the Anglo-Saxonemocracies, the Dominion would probably become a battleground, for theanadian West and North-West would be a &quot; no-man&apos;s land &quot; between the twoIhief protagonists, the United States and the U.S.S.R.   Canada&apos;s desire for goodelations with Russia therefore springs from the strongest of all instincts, self-jireservation.   Yet she attaches much less importance to this than to her friend-&apos; hips with the United Kingdom and the United States.   The Canadian Govern-! Jent proved this several months ago when they fearlessly unmasked the Russianpy organisation in Canada and defied Moscow in a matter which might earnhem the Kremlin&apos;s bitterest hostility.21.   Canadian anxiety to remain on the best possible terms with both theJnited Kingdom and the United States again leads to a policy of compromises.Whenever a difference of opinion arises between London and Washington Ottawai lies to find a basis for agreement between them.   Sometimes this annoys us andOccasionally it seriously embarrasses us.   But once more we must show under-ktnding and recognise the Canadians&apos; deep sense that their secure existence as a
nation is conditional upon concord between their great partner across the atlantic and their great neighbour across the 49th Parallel. No doubt this sometimesleads them to be over-anxious for agreement at any price between the two. Itpushes Canadian Ministers into a position where we sometimes think them tootimid in standing up to the United States. But let us remember that at the sametime the Americans are probably charging them with being too subservient to us.In any case, their desire to act the part of mediator whenever necessary betweenthe United Kingdom and the United States is dictated by dire necessity fromtheir point of view, is a fixed element in their external policy and must be bothunderstood and accepted by us.22. It is true that in their anxiety always to secure Anglo-american agreement they sometimes seek to over-persuade us to make concessions to the americans. They are occasionally too timid in their attitude to the Americans.With this qualification, however, they are good judges of American character and thought. They know their Americans well and understand them better thanmost other foreigners do. A kind of North-American &quot; Cameraderie &quot; exists between the two peoples and they are accustomed to speak to each other confi-dentially and frankly. Official Canadian advice on American affairs is thereforeusually sound. When the Canadians say that the American reaction to such andsuch an issue will be this or that, they generally have good reasons for their judgment. I think the Canadians can be valuable partners to us in difficult negotiations with the United States.23. Some people believe that as between the United Kingdom and theUnited States, the Canadians have already made their choice in favour of thelatter. They urge that the Canadian outlook on affairs is little different from theAmerican and that Canadians are influenced to the point of subservience by american thought. This view is incorrect. The Canadians are a people of independent mind -independent both of the Americans and, in spite of theirsentiment for us, of us. But such mental leanings as they have in favour of either the United Kingdom or the United States are mostly in the direction of theformer. A supreme example of this was the Canadian&apos;s conduct in September1939. Although the Americans were opposed to fighting and remained neutralfor more than another two years, the Canadian Parliament decided to enter thewar immediately at Britain&apos;s side. They did not pay over-much heed to Americanopinions or interests, but were swayed by those of Britain, which they believed to be also their own. It is significant that they were the only people on thecontinent of North, Central and South America who declared war before the direct attack on United States territory at the end of 1941.24. Nor does this affinity with the United Kingdom rather than with theUnited States appear only in times of crisis. In some measure it is instinctiveand constant. American newspapers, periodicals, books, broadcasts, tourists,conversation and other vehicles of expression pour daily across the border intothe Dominion. They are bound to have a considerable influence on Canadianthought in general, although many Canadians dislike and resent this. Yet inspite of it the Canadian character and mind remain British (or, counting theinherited French influence, European) rather than American. Evidences of thisduring my five years in Canada interested me greatly.25. It showed itself, for example, in this way. Usually during the warthe high political authorities in London and Washington agreed on policy; but every now and then they disagreed. Under the system of exchange of information jbetween Members of the Commonwealth these disagreements were reported to canada and the other Dominions. In about four cases out of five the instinctiveCanadian reaction to the issue involved was similar to ours and not to theAmerican. In some cases the Government in Ottawa agreed with the Americansrather than with us, but generally they were much more inclined to our side ofthe argument. Their instincts, their attitudes to affairs, the way their mindsworked were British rather than American.26. Moreover, the Canadians resent the tendency of the Americans c!to:throw7 their weight about &quot; in international affairs. As is plain from what Ihave written, they prize their independence. They realise that it is morethreatened by the United States than by the United Kingdom. Within our commonwealth system Canada is completely free. The United kingdom authorities do not attempt to interfere or dictate in the Dominions internal orexternal affairs.   On the contrary, we are extremely careful to respect Canadian
national rights and susceptibilities. The Americans, on the other hand, sometimesattempt to boss the Canadians, to use their power to impose policies on them.Political authorities in Washington no less than commercial interests in new york do this. It is sometimes due to blundering tactlessness rather than deliberateaggressiveness on the part of American administrators, but it irritates the canadians and often makes them feel uncomfortable with their powerful neigh-bours. Their official relations with us are much easier and more mutuallyunderstanding. Again, whilst Canadians like and admire the magnificentqualities in American democracy, they are fullly aware of American shortcomings.The unreliability of American promises, the crude boastfulness of americans and their national selfishness constantly annoy the authorities in Ottawa. Theycontrast these unfavourably with British reliability, reticence and tolerance.They criticise our faults, but they feel much surer and happier working with us than with the Americans. These are additional factors binding them to theirpartnership with us.27. At- the same time, however, the Canadians cannot afford to compromisetheir close and friendly relations with the United States. Moreover, for practical reasons many of the younger men in the Canadian Services and industry have ahankering after closer co-operation with the United States, rather than with us,in naval, military, air force and economic matters. Their influence is gainingstrength. So the pulls of the United Kingdom and of the United States onCanada are nicely balanced.28. Before the war there was perhaps a tendency for the influence of london in Ottawa to decline and that of Washington to increase, because London was far away and Washington comparatively close. The continuous stream ofexcellent cables expounding British policy which flowed from the dominions office to the Department of External Affairs could not counteract the disadvantages of geography. Paper is a poor substitute for people when it comes to fostering close co-operation between nations. Two thousand miles of choppyocean kept us from holding frequent personal meetings with the Canadians,whereas visits were constantly exchanged across their land frontier betweenpersonalities in the American and Canadian capitals. The trans-Atlantic aero-plane, which flew into its own during the war, has changed all that. london is nearer to Ottawa by aeroplane than Washington is to it by train, and thequicker flying time from Washington does not make any practical difference.Our Ministers, high officials, Service Chiefs, industrialists, Trade Union leaders and others can easily cross the ocean for a few days&apos; or even a few hours&apos; con-sultation with their Canadian colleagues, and their Canadian opposite numberscan return the visit. This is a development of far-reaching importance. Inmy opinion the chief reason- apart from common zeal for a common cause why co-operation between the United Kingdom and Canada throughout thewar was so close and almost invariably unruffled was the existence of the trans-Atlantic aeroplane. Whenever a disagreement looked like becoming serious theR.A.F. Transport Command enabled responsible authorities on both sides of the atlantic to meet, sit round a table together and resolve the trouble in directdiscussion. As a result of this regular practice personalities in the two Govern-ments got to know, understand and generally like (or at least respect!) eachother in a measure which in pre-war days would have been impossible. Insteadof being strangers with a vague political attachment to each other they becamecolleagues and friends accustomed to work in personal comradeship together.We in Ottawa watched understanding between the two countries grow by leapsand bounds as a result of this process. It must be continued and developed inpeace. Provided that the United Kingdom representatives in these mutualexchanges maintain the high standard of ability and quality that their war-timepredecessors attained, it will be one of the best guarantees that Britain&apos;s influence in Canada remains strong.Canada and the British Commonwealth29. Enthusiastic Imperialists in Britain are inclined to assert that Canada&apos;sfeeling for the British Commonwealth is luke-warm and her support of it weak.This is a mistaken belief. The attachment of most Canadians to Britain is deep,constant and, in a crisis, passionate. Twice in a generation they have provedthis gloriously in the supreme trial of war. Even French-speaking Canadians,who are always ready to voice suspicion and criticism of Britain&apos;s allegedImperialism, know in their heart of hearts that the surest guarantee of their
freedom and enjoyment of minority rights is continuing association with Britain.For this reason they in fact feel more friendly towards us in Britain than theydo towards their own English-speaking fellow-countrymen.30. Canadian loyalty to Britain extends to the other members of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations, but in much less warm degree. If Britain disappearedto-morrow, I doubt whether Canada would bother greatly to maintain brotherlyrelations with Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Eire. She wouldconcentrate on strengthening her ties (without surrendering her sovereignindependence) with the United States of America. But because Britain is itscentre and head, Canada remains attached to the British Commonwealth andpreserves a tolerant and friendly regard for the other junior partners in the concern. The comradeship of war has helped this. On the other hand, the canadians feel that theirs is a larger, stronger and more important nation thanthese others, and they are eager to emphasise its individuality as distinct fromtheirs. They dislike intensely the tendency in London to talk about &apos;&apos; theDominions &quot; and &quot; the Dominion point of view,&quot; as if the overseas nations ofthe Commonwealth were a set of quintuplets of exactly the same age, character,mentality and capacity. They urge that each Dominion has a separateindividuality, different from every one of the others, and that instead of astandardised Dominion point of view existing there are five distinct points ofview determined by the different characters and circumstances of each country.31. In spite of Canada&apos;s fundamental attachment to Britain and theCommonwealth, most Canadians are reserved in their expressions of it. A small minority are vociferous and perfervid in declaring their devotion to the Empire,but this only makes the others more reticent on the subject. Three reasons promptthis. First, &quot;waving the Imperial Flag&quot; plays into the hands of the French-speaking extremists by allowing them to arouse the worst prejudices of French-speaking Canadians. Second, too many public avowals of Canada&apos;s unswervingmembership of the Commonwealth are apt to lower Canada&apos;s status in the eyes of the Americans, some of whom are still inclined to suppose that Canada isan obedient slave of Britain. Third, whilst being loyal citizens of the BritishCommonwealth Canadians themselves are jealous of Canada&apos;s position as aseparate, sovereign nation and are averse to proclaiming association with theCommonwealth to an extent which appears to prejudice that position. We mustnot misunderstand this nor under-estimate the true devotion of most Canadiansto the commonwealth in general and to Britain in particular.Reasonableness oe Canadians32 In spite of their various attachments in this or that direction mostCanadians are not emotional. Sentiment plays little part in their judgments on public affairs. They are dispassionate. No doubt exposure for several monthsevery year to temperatures many degrees below zero helps to make them so. Inever met a group of Ministers and officials more ready to judge issues on the strict merits of the case, by a process of reason to the exclusion of sentiment.Their policy, like that of every other people, is of course based primarily onCanadian self-interest. But it is an enlightened self-interest. They havequalities of sanity, wisdom and far-sightedness which are uncommon. No doubtbecause of their long training in British methods of government and their longassociation with us (as Avell as because life has been tougher for them than for the americans) they are more mature than the Americans. They are the leadersneither of a small nation uncertain of itself, and therefore inclined to be bump-tious, nor of a great nation tempted to play power politics. They represent a&quot; middlesized &quot; nation whose security and prosperity depends on an orderly and peaceful international system, and, having no other axe to grind, they can themore easily take an objective and rational view of external problems.The Future33. Canada has emerged from the war economically and militarily much stronger than she was before, and with an enhanced political reputation. I havesketched her weaknesses. They are serious and encumbering. Nevertheless, as have also observed, they are more than counterbalanced by the unity, pride and confidence which the Canadians feel in themselves and their country. In spite ofthe young nation&apos;s difficulties, it has found itself and is growing steadily instature. It is not yet one of the powers-that-be, but it shows some of the marksof a power that is to be.
34. The qualities which have made Canada sturdy and sane are the qualities of her people as a whole. They are not an illusion created by great leaders.Canada has known Prime Ministers with character, ability and vision, likeSir John MacDonald and Sir Wilfred Laurier. None of them has been more; remarkable than Mr. Mackenzie King. Whilst other statesmen have come andgone he has shown an extraordinary tendency to go on for ever. Having exceededin June 1946 Sir John MacDonald&apos;s immense period of office by retaining thePremiership for nineteen years he is now sprinting forward to break the record ofthe only Prime Minister of a British country who has ever governed longer,Sir Robert Walpole. His enemies attribute his success to luck. But, althoughluck sometimes plays its part, politics are a game of skill, not chance, andMr. Mackenzie King&apos;s uncanny and unfailing ability at playing it has made him the world&apos;s most invincible party leader. But he is much more than that. long experience, cool judgment and wide vision have made him a sound and pro-gressive professional statesman. He stands head and shoulders above any other public figure in Canada. He has dominated the political scene there for nearly a quarter of a century.35. Yet no one would say that Mr. Mackenzie King has the dynamiccharacter, dominating intellect and creative genius which raise a nation aboveitself and give it temporarily an influence in the world which it cannot after-wards sustain. His success is due to other qualities. His techinque of govern-ment is the opposite of that of the masterful leader. He does not so much impresshis ideas on the mass of his countrymen as allow their ideas to be impressed upon him. His policy is a faithful reflection of their political thoughts and desires.He expresses what he thinks they want him to express, and being an exceptionallyshrewd judge of their wishes he retains their support year in and year out,Election in and Election out. He is now, however, 72 years old. In the natureof things he cannot stand the strain of modern democratic leadership much longer. His departure from the scene will make a considerable difference inthe relations between persons and the balance of parties in the Canadian Govern-ment. But it will make no difference to the main features and trends of Canadiancharacter and policy. As I have suggested, for all his remarkable influence,i  Mr. Mackenzie King has not shaped them, he has merely interpreted them.36.   Other men will carry on where he leaves off.   Though amongst his own&apos;   contemporaries no one can equal his gifts, amongst the younger men they canbe matched.  If they are not to be found in the same measure in any one individual,they are spread amongst several.  In Ottawa there is a group of young politicians,civil servants and other public men endowed with remarkable abilities.   They: work as a team and are formidable.  Their ripening wisdom, unselfish patriotismi and humane outlook are amongst Canada&apos;s finest human assets.   In command of3 her affairs they will assuredly raise the nation&apos;s influence and power to new[ heights.MALCOLM MacDONALD.1etThe Residency, Penang,August 1946.yesi-adeh1d.f
