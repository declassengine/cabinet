Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1946SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 421\%h November, 1946CABINETADMISSION  OF  POLES  TO   CIVILIAN  EMPLOYMENTMemoeandum by the Minister of Labour and National ServiceI am concerned at the slow progress of the negotiations to secure the entryof Poles from the Resettlement Corps into civilian industry. I have alreadyreferred to this subject in a progress report to the Foreign Labour Committee(FLO. (46) 16). In the discussion at the Foreign Labour Committee the viewwas expressed that part of the difficulty is due to the fact that the discus-sions with the various industries are being conducted by the Ministers separatelyresponsible for each industry, and that the Unions concerned are unable to besatisfied as to what is being done with industries for wdiich other Ministers areconcerned. It is quite clear that one of the reasons why the industries are oftennot forthcoming in this matter is that each feels that if it expresses willingnessto take Poles it will receive an unfair proportion, and that other industries bystanding out will get none. This is clearly one major cause of the resistancehitherto shown to the introduction of Poles by the Agricultural Unions. Thesuggestion was therefore made that I, as Minister generally responsible for Polishresettlement, should assume responsibility for the discussions with separateindustries. It may be noted that a high level Official Committee is now beingappointed, under the Foreign Labour Committee, to supervise all action to securethe employment of Poles, and on the official level these consultations with separateindustries can be co-ordinated on that Committee.2.   If the above proposals are accepted by my colleagues, I propose that(a) In cases where negotiations have reached a deadlock or where they havenot yet begun, the best course will be for me to take the work overand to resume or institute negotiations with the industry as a whole(i.e., with representatives of both employers and workers) on the basisof the need of the individual industries for more workers in thenational interest.(6) In those industries where negotiations have already begun, I should getinto touch with each of my colleagues concerned and consider withhim whether the negotiations should be left to continue in theirexisting channels or whether there would be a greater prospect ofsuccess if I myself took them over. Where a satisfactory settlementis on the point of being reached, no change in method of consultationwould be advisable.3. In the case of the coalmining industry, I suggest that the same lineshould be taken, the procedure being that I should invite the representativesof the Coal Board and of the National Union of Mine Workers to take partwith me in joint discussions. I do not think we can leave the position in thecoalmining industry where it is. At present the public position is that theMinister of Fuel and Power has announced in the House of Commons thathe Mall defer, at any rate for the time being, to the views of the National Unionof Mine Workers and will not force into the pits either trained Polish minersor other Poles who could be trained. Apart from the loss of useful man-powerto the coalmines at this most critical time, this situation provides a very badSample for other industries and gives them a formidable excuse for non-co-operation. Even if the opposition of the Mine Workers were maintained and!t were ultimately decided that it was impossible to overcome it, it would be[32697]
a positive gain, at a period when negotiations to secure the entry of Poles intoa number of other industries, are going on, to be able to say that negotiationsfor getting Poles into the mines are continuing. If, on the other hand, I am tobe in the position that I am forced to admit in my other negotiations that forthe time being the Government are doing nothing about getting Poles into theindustry which prima facie needs them most, my position would clearly be;extremely weak.4.   I recommend, therefore : -(1) That I should take over the negotiations for securing&quot; the entry of Polesfrom the Resettlement Corps into civilian industry in the case ofthose industries where a deadlock has been reached or where nego-tiations have not begun; and&apos; resume or institute these with theindustry concerned as a whole;(2) That in the case of industries where negotiations are already in progressI should consult with each of my colleagues concerned and agreewith him whether the negotiations should be left to continue in theirexisting channels or whether there would be a greater prospect ofsuccess if I took them over;(3) That this procedure should apply also in the- case of coalmining andshould take the form of joint discussions with&apos; the National &quot;Unionof Mine Workers and the Coal Board.G: A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,12th November, 1946.
