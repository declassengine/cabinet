JhIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY 1s GOVERNMENT^ 9 7COPY NO. H..... jQjlEJMI 43326th Novem ber,  19U6.CABINET^QPO^IL-INTERGOVERNMENTAL SHIPPING ORGANISATIONMemoran dura by the Minister of Transport1. In Memorandum CP. (i+6) 370 I reported to my colleaguesthe consideration &quot;being given through the United MaritimeConsultative Council to proposals for an intergovernmentalshipping organisation.2. The United Maritime Consultative Council at its secondand final session in Washington further discussed this matterand agreed upon certain Recommendations to the GovernmentsMembers of the Council.3* The first Recommendation is that an    IntergovernmentalMaritime Consultative Organisation should be established as aspecialised agency of the United Nations.      The Council agreedupon a Draft Convention for this purpose (subject to reservationof certain formal points for further consideration by Governmentsand to some reservations by the Indian Delegation)  andrecommended, that the Intergovernmental Maritime ConsultativeOrganisation should be established on the basis of this Draft.h* The scope of the proposed Organisation was somewhatadjusted from the proposals of the London Committee as describedin CP. (1+6) 370. There was unanimous agreement that theOrganisation should, be authorised and equipped to providemachinery for co-operation  &quot;in the field of governmentalregulation and practices relating to technical matters of allkinds affecting shipping engaged in international trade&quot;.In this field the discussions in the Economic and Social Councilof the United Nations and the Temporary Transport andCommunications Commission have already revealed the necessity andgeneral desire for such an Organisation.      Secondly,  it was agreedthat the Organisation should &quot;encourage the removal of all formsof discriminatory action and unnecessary restrictions byGovernments affecting shipping engaged in international trade soas to promote the availability of shipping services to thecommerce of the world without discrimination&quot;.      This is animportant principle for us to establish internationally and. theproposed Organisation should give us a forum in which we canchallenge any action on the part of other nations which is notin compliance with it.      The Indian Delegation in the Councilwere under instructions to reserve the Indian Government&apos;sright to subsidize Indian shipping or even to discriminate infavour of Indian shipping in so far as it was necessary tomaintain and expand an Indian mercantile marine.      Althoughcertain other Governments doubtless accepted the generalorinciole with some tacit reservations,  the Council was notwilling to whittle down the general statement of principle;    theIndians therefore reserved their position on this provision.

5* The most controversial issue was whether theOrganisation should .bo authorised to deal with any other andwider shipping question which, might come up for intergovernmentaldiscussion.      It was finally agreed that the Organisation shouldhe authorised to handle any shipping problems of an internationalcharacter involving matters of general principle that may hereferred to it by the United Nations;- but the draft declaresthat matters which are suitable for settlement through the normalprocesses of international shipping business are not&quot;to bewithin the scope of the Organisation.      This solution accords -well with my own ideas.      If we arc to have an intergovernmentalshipping body,  it should be equipped to handle any shippingquestions which may from time to time come up for discussionthrough intergovernmental rna.chi.nery.      On the other hand, weare not anxious to provide a forum for international expositionof shipping policies which ere opposed to our generalconception that the shipping services of the world should beprovided by those who can most efficiently and economicallyoperate t h em - in fa ir competition.      Recogn ition t ha t m otterawhich are not for intergovernmental discussion can and shouldbe dealt with through normal commercial channels is importantto us.6. The constitution of the proposed Organisation in theDraft Convention  prepared by the Council incorporates theessential features of the London Plan,  in particular inproviding for a balance between the maritime and the non-maritime powers on the most important organ,  the Council.The powers of the Assembly,  representing all participants inthe Organisation,  have been -somewhat strengthened to accordwith the general practice of the United Nations.      Membershipof the proposed Organisation would be open to all members ofthe United Nations, with provision for including other nationsif necessary.7- . The United Liaritime Consultative Council accepted theview that the proposed Organisation should only be establishedas a specialised agency of the United Nations through theprocedures of the United Nations.      The Council has thereforerecommended its Member Governments to take appropriate actionto request the Economic and Social Council to convene aconference of all interested Governments for the purpose ofadopting a constitution for an Intergovernmental MaritimeConsultative Organisation.      At such a conference thoseGovernments wh..ich have meanwhile accepted the Draft Conventionproposed by the United Maritime Consultative Council will   -endeavour to secure general acceptance of the proposals.8. It will take some time to establish the proposedpermanent Organisation,  and the United Maritime ConsultativeCouncil considered that there should be some interim bodymeanwhile available to act in respect of the number of mattersin the technical field which need early discussion,  and alsoto facilitate the establishment,  through the United Nations,of the proposed permanent body.      Accordingly the Council hasrecommended to Member Governments the acceptance of anAgreement,  prepared by the Council,  establishing a ProvisionalMaritime Consultative Council with terms of reference identicalwith those oroposed for the permanent body,  but having only asimple constitution appropriate to a purely provisianal body.This Agreement would come into effect,  and the ProvisionalCouncil come into being,  upon acceptance by not less than 12Governments,  including 5 important maritime Governments.

A.B.Ministry of Transport,26th Novembor,  1 924.6.9* Since the Temporary Transport and CommunicationsCommission considered the question of establishing an inter-go ver.nme.ntal shipping body early this year, the Secretary Generalof the United Nations has been kept in touch with the discussionof the matter by the United Maritime Consultative Council.      TheCouncil authorised the despatch of a communication to theSecretary General inforr.ii.ng him that they had completed theirconsideration -and were making Recommendations to Governments.The Council also resolved that the terms of the Recommendations,including the Draft Convention and the Agreement for a ProvisionalOrganisation,  should be communicated, to the Secretary General onthe 1st December, with the concurrence    of the Governments Membersof the Council.10. I regard these Recommendations as fully in accord withthe views which I have expressed in my earlier papers on thissubject and which have the approval of my colleagues.      I believethat the Recommendations will command the acceptance of the largemajority,  if not all,  of the Governments Members of the UnitedMaritime Consultative Council.      I request authority(a) to accept the Recommendations of the Council;(b) to initiate action through the United Kingdomrepresentatives on the Seonoraic and Social Councilat its next session designed to bring about on earlyconference of interested Governments for the purposeof agreeing upon the Convention to establish theIntergoveramenta1 Maritirae Consu11ative Organisationas a specialised agency of the United Notions;(c) to accept the Agreement establishing a ProvisionalMaritime Consultative Council;(d) to concur in the communication of the Recommendationsof the Council to the Secretary General of the UnitedRations.
