(46) 418Sth November, 1946CABINETCIVIC RESTAURANTS BILLJoint Memorandum by the Minister of Food, the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland1. In approving the Civic Restaurants Bill the Legislation Committeereserved for the decision of the. Cabinet the question whether local authoritiesshould be empowered to supply intoxicating or excisable liquor in restaurantsoperated under the Bill.2. The argument for giving local authorities this power is that it is notunreasonable in itself and that without it they may be handicapped in competingwith restaurants run in the same area by private enterpri se. On the other hand,there will be criticism from the licensed trade and from temperance interests iflocal authorities are authorised by a public general Act to sell drink. In Englandand Wales a few authorities have been so authorised by private legislation inconnection with special powers for the provision of refreshments on piers or atgolf clubs, &amp;c: but in Scotland powers to sell excisable liquor have, as a matterof policy, been refused to all local authorities who have sought to obtain themin provisional orders or local Acts. Critics will also point out that drink hasnot hitherto been sold in British Restaurants; and power to sell it has not beensought by the local authorities concerned.3. The Minister of Food is of opinion that the power to sell intoxicating orexcisable liquor should be given; and the Home Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Scotland do not dissent from this view.4. Whatever decision is reached, we are advised that the position mustbe made plain by a specific provision in the Bill, authorising or forbidding thesale of drink. Otherwise the law will be in doubt. If, however, the decision isthat authority should be given, a special procedural difficulty arises in Scotland.5. In the larger Scottish burghs, in which civic restaurants are most likelyto be provided, the licensing court consists of the burgh magistrates, who are alsomembers of the local authority owning the restaurant. If, therefore, the Billprovides that the ordinary licensing law is to apply, the position will be that thelocal authority, or its agent, will have to seek a certificate from a group of itsown members sitting as the licensing court. Such a proceclure; even if competent,could hardly fail to attract serious criticism.6. The only alternative which the Secretary of State for Scotland cansuggest is that the ordinary licensing law should not apply, and that authorityto sell excisable liquor in a civic restaurant should be given by the Ministerof Food, after consultation with the Secretary of State (a course not acceptableto the Minister of Food) or by the Secretary of State, after consultation withthe Minister of Food. There are, however, objections in principle to giving toa Central Department the right to authorise the sale of drink in public restaurantsrun by local authorities in competition with restaurants belonging to privateowners who have annually to make out a case to the local licensing court, which!s required to consider objections and which is in a position to deal with eachcase with a full knowledge of local circumstances and requirements.7. On balance, therefore, we should be disposed, if drink is to be sold, tolet the ordinary law take its course, notwithstanding the difficulties to whichwe have called attention.J. S.J. C. E.J.
