From:Control Commission for Germany, Berlin.To:Control Office for germany and Austria.29th October,19u7.Personal for Chancellor of the Duchy from Marshalof the Royal Air Force Sir Sholto Douglas.1. I have been studying your SUGRA 738 and 739 of26th October which needless to say cause me great anxiety.A reduction in the ration  scale in the British Zone at this juncture will undoubtedly have the gravest consequences.2. I appreciate that the gravity of the situation isknown to you.      I wish however to make my own  position inthis matter clear to you.      The economy of the British Zonehas deteriorated to an  extent which stultifies all ourattempts to put across our policy in Germany.      Until   wecan restore it we shall continue to waste the effort andthe money which our occupation costs us.      This situationis due to prolonged semi-starvation of the people,  to heavyexports of coal at the expense of the economy of theWestern Zones,  to overcrowding arising from our agreements with our allies about refugees,  to export of timber without regard to the requirements    of our Zone,  end a number ofsubsidiary causes of which you are aware.      I do notcriticise what has happened in the past but I say mostemphatically that unless steps are taken now to rectify theposition I cannot accept the responsibility for theconsequ ences.3. The first step is to secure somehow and fromsomewhere sufficient food to maintain the present rationscale.      Prom SUGRA 739 we seem to be handing on theresponsibility for this entirely to the United States.I notice however that no mention is made, of our presentstocks of bread groins in the United Kingdom.      I have no information as to what these are but is there not here a means of tiding us over this critical period.      I shallbe grateful if you will bring this telegram to the attentionof the Prime Minister.

6 0PROM:      CONTROL OFFICE FOR GERMANY AND AUSTRIATO: CONTROL COMMISSION FOR GERMANY, BERLIN.SUGRA 738 26th October,  19u7.Subject is GRAIN IMPORTS.1. We agree that a reduction now in the ration level wouldbe disastrous and that every possible step must be taken toavoid it.2..        We have discussed with Ministry of Food possibility of import or diversion from U.K.  to meet the immediate emergency,and they have told us that they consider this to be impossible.3. Only other sblution to meet the immediate short termemergency appears to be a re-arrangement of the U.S.D.A.programme for fourth quarter shipments from U.S.A.k* In face of  the overall shortage and with the enormousaddition to difficulties of all recipient countries broughtabout by the American shipping strike (which we heardyesterday fortunately shows some signs now of coming to anend),  there seems little prospect  that the allocation of565,000 tons to the U.S./U.K.  zones for the fourth quartercan be exceeded.      There is, for example,  a pressing supplycrisis for India,   statistically no less severe than your own and with political implications seemingly no less serious.5. We are pressing very urgently in Washington forre-arrangement of the existing U.S.D.A. allocation of565,000 tons for Western Germany,  and have  suggested thatshipments should be pooled in accordance with the proportionsagreed in the joint demand which you and the Americans haveforwarded to I.E.F.C., namely a ratio of requirements of two to one in your favour.      It  seems unfortunately alreadycertain that even the total quantity of 365 j000 tons cannot now be shipped in time to arrive this year.6. My immediately following telegram,  therefore,repeats to you a signal sent by Foreign Office to Washingtoncontaining our views and those of Ministry of Pood.7. You will have been discussing the position with your American colleagues and any support which they willsend to Washington on the lines of the final paragraph ofmy immediately following telegram will no doubt be helpful.

Prom:      Control Office for Germany and AustriaTo: Control Commission BerlinSUGRA 739    26th October, 1946.    SECRET.Subject is grain imports - my immediately preceding telegram.      (Following is text of Foreign Office message to washington.)1. The present situation in the British Zone of germany is critical.      If the present ration is maintained the stocks in the British Zone will have fallen to 72,000 tons flourequivalent by 10th &apos;November.      Unless the ration is  reducedfor the 95th period the four weeks beginning on 11th November.there is a deficiency of 55*000 tons and there is as yet no indication of any source apart from the United States fromwhich this amount and a replenishment of stocks might beobtained.2. The programme of United States Cereals Export for october to December provides 565,000 tons as grain for thetwo German Zones.      Of this amount only 1.40,0 JO tons has beenprogrammed for the British Zone whilst the smaller AmericanZone is  to be provided with no less than 425*000 tons.3. 140,000 tons is wholly insufficient for the needsof the British Zone.      Rationing in our Zone will certainlybreak down unless we obtain additional supplies.      On theother hand,  if the 565,000 tons now allocated to: the UnitedStates and British Zones is shared equitably between the twothere is possibly just enough to get the  two Zones through to the end of the year.      It is  essential however that thesupplies should arrive in time.4. It is this year impossible for us  to help theBritish Zone by diverting our own supplies.      All probablesupplies available to us by 31st December from sources otherthan United states will be insufficient to meet the require-ments of the United Kingdom and other areas of direct UnitedKingdom responsibility leaving less than nothing from these other sources for the British Zone of Germany - or for that matter for India.      Thus:-Bread grain requirements for Thousand tonsfourth quarter; 1945&quot; wheat equivalentUnited Kingdom 1354*other areas of direct United.

Prospective Suppliesthousand, tons wheat equivalentCanada .          1343.3Australia 180.1. rgent ina -                    ISvljTotal&apos;; 1538.8Deficit supplies against requirements 386.6The prospect of securing any subs tantially greaterquantity of cereals from the Argentine by the end ofDecember is poor.      There is no chance of getting increased supplies from Canada owing to evergrowing transport delays.Therefore to meet the deficit to  the above areas of british responsibility - quite apart from the British Zone - suppliesmust come from the United States.      Yet the United Statesfourth quarter programme proposes to make available only58,000 tons for the United Kingdom and areas of United Kingdomresponsibility (other than the British Zone and India).      Inaddition shipments for the United Kingdom during the quarter inrespect of earlier loading programmes will be about 132,000tons.      There remains  therefore an uncovered balance of196,000 tons of wheat.    &apos; Therefore any diversion of UnitedKingdom supplies to the British Zone during the quarter wouldbe at the direct risk of inability to maintain our breadration or it is not too much to say of starvation in british colonies.5. It is unnecessary to emphasise the disastrous effecton this country if we were forced to  reduce our own rationsin order to feed the Germans particularly at a time whenconsumption in the United States is unrestricted.      Far from-reducing our bread ration,we attach the greatest importanceto bringing it  to an early end.      But wheat is corning in soslowly that it  is still impossible to propose a date for theend of bread rationing.   &apos; With consumption in this countrylimited with  reserves absorbed and our stock position much less favourable than it was last year we cannot contemplate the United Kingdom making any diversions or loans to Germany.6. If the total of 565,000 tons to be exported fromthe United States to Western Germany as a whole had beenshared between the  two Zones proportionately on the basisof their stated import requirements for the crop year theBritish Zone would have received 375,000 tons.      Such an allocation would still impose a great strain upon distributionwithin our Zone and would not permit any accumulation towardsthe target stock of li.00,000 tons which it is considered desirable to build up.      However it would permit maintenanceof the increased ration of 1550 calories up to the end of theyear, but the situation would then be critical unless thecontinuance of supplies  is assured.7. Although the Americans have agreed in principle to  the integration of the  two Zones it appears that theyare not prepared to agree forthwith to any pooling of suppliesuntil all the arrangements for the economic integration of theZones are completed. -    As you- know they have stated that untilintegration is complete they wish the needs of each Zone tobe presented separately to the I.E.D.C. by the respectiveGov e government n t s.

8. It is imperative that the  jreseht criticalposition should he made clear to  the American Government.They must he made aware that unless  the supplies whichhave already he en allocated to the  two German Zones arepooled and shipments made on that basis  forthwith therewill he an early breakdown in the distribution of supplies in the British Zone of Germany and the United Kingdom willbe absolutely powerless to prevent it.      Such a disasterwould completely wreck the policy for Germany which mr. Byrnes outlined in his Stuttgart speech and it wouldhave the most far reaching consequences for the whole world position 03o our two countries.
