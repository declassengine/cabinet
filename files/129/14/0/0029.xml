THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1946 c,________________&apos;__________.......^.....__________l     Io oSECRET Copy No.C,p. (46) 429\%th November, 1946CABINETTHE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, MONTREAL,SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 1946Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National ServiceTHE International Labour Conference, which was held at Montreal from19th September to 9th October, inclusive, was by common consent one of the mostsuccessful that the International Labour Organisation has ever held. A greatdeal of really useful work was done and, although inevitably matters were raisedwhich caused extremely keen and sometimes controversial debate, the spirit ofthe proceedings throughout was in general most harmonious and of a kind whichaugurs well for the future effectiveness of the Organisation. It can be said thatthe Organisation has passed successfully through its immediate post-wardifficulties, that it is well launched on the process of rebuilding and developingits activities to meet the new and greater problems of the post-war world andthat it is ready and anxious in a spirit of complete collaboration to take its placein the general structure of world organisation and to work with the UnitedNations and other inter-governmental organisations for the attainment of thecommon objectives laid down in the Constitution of the International LabourOrganisation, in the Declaration of Philadelphia and in the Charter of the UnitedNations. The extent to which, and the manner in which, this latter ideal maybe realised depends upon whether the United Nations shows an equal spirit ofaccommodation in the working out of the arrangements for collaboration betweenthe two Organisations.2. In addition to the members of the delegation, I myself, as previousMinisters of Labour have done and as I did last year, attended the Conferencefor a short time and was accompanied by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministryof Labour and National Service, Sir Godfrey Ince. In accordance with customI addressed the Conference, and my remarks, which are attached to thismemorandum as Appendix I, were very well received.3. The Government delegates were Mr. G. Myrddin-Evans, Deputy Secre-tary, Ministry of Labour and National Service and Chairman of the GoverningBody of the International Labour Office, and Sir Arthur Dawe, Deputy Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office. The employers&apos; delegate was Sir John ForbesWatson and the workers&apos; delegate, Sir Joseph Hallsworth. The full list of thedelegates and advisers is shown in Appendix II. I was again struck by theauthority possessed in the Conference by all three sections of the British delega-&apos;ion. They were probably the most influential delegation attending the Con-ference. The result of the influence enjoyed by the Government representatives,^legates and advisers alike, is that in general they were able to persuade theConference to proceed along lines acceptable to the British Government whilestaining the goodwill of other delegations. I wish again this year to express mygratitude to my colleagues for sparing for this important work officials of suchability and persuasiveness. A word of recognition is due, too, to Sir John Forbes-Watson and Sir Joseph Hallsworth and all the members of the employers&apos; andinkers&apos; groups. The British non-governmental representatives are, of course,completely free to follow their own line at the Conference without governmental[32724] b
interference (this is not true of all delegations) and inevitably there were occasionswhere they felt it necessary to take a line different from that followed by theGovernment representatives; but throughout, their co-operation with the Govern-ment representatives was most cordial and friendly and in many cases resulted inagreed policies being followed.4. The Conference was presided over most ably by the Hon. HumphreyMitchell, Minister of Labour for Canada. The main accomplishments of theConference can be summarised very briefly as follows : (1) Medical Examination for fitness for employment of children and youngpersonsThe Conference adopted two Conventions, relating respectively to employmentin industry and to employment in non-industrial occupations, and one Eecom-mendation on this subject.(2) Restriction of Night Work of children and young persons in non-industrialoccupationsThe Conference adopted one Convention and one Recommendation on thissubject.(3) Minimum Standards of Social Policy in Non-Self-Governing TerritoriesA first discussion took place as to those aspects of this question which mightbe suitable for inclusion in a Convention and it was decided to place on the agendaof the 1947 Conference the following subjects : &apos;(a) Social Policy in non-self-governing territories;(6) the application of international labour standards to non-self-governingterritories;(c) the maximum length of contracts of employment with a view to a finaldecision being then taken on a Convention or Conventions.(4) Constitutional AmendmentsThe Conference approved a substantial number of amendments to theConstitution of the Organisation.(5) Budgetary and Financial MattersThe Conference approved (a) provisional financial regulations to govern the future financial procedureof the Organisation;(b) its Budget for 1947.5. I shall in due course be submitting to my colleagues detailed commentson the above matters together with the action I recommend in regard to them,and I need not trouble the Cabinet further at the present stage except to remarkbriefly on the following points : Constitutional Amendments6. A small Working Party set up by the Paris Conference of 1945. andpresided over by Mr. Myrddin-Evans (Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Labourand National Service) had produced unanimous recommendations (except on thesingle point of representation at the Conference) for amending substantiallythe Constitution of the I.L.O. in order to bring it into accord with modern needs.These proposals were adopted by the Conference with very little alteration, buttwo points call for comment.7. The French Government proposed a change in the basis of representationof Member States at the Conference which would have had the effect of sub-stantially reducing Government influence in the Conference. This alterationwas resisted by the British delegates (Government, employer and worker) andreceived little support in Committee.  The proposal was ultimately withdrawn.8. A majority of the Constitutional Committee were in favour of insertingin the Preamble of the Constitution words recognising the principle of equal payfor equal work without distinction as to sex. The formula eventually adoptedwas, however, &quot;recognition of the principle of equal remuneration for workof equal value &quot; which is in fact less precise than the reference in the origin
Constitution.  The final vote was taken not on the individual amendments but on ...the body of amendments as a whole, and in the circumstances the Britishgovernment representatives were authorised to vote for the Instrument of&quot;Amendment without reservation.Budgetary and Financial Matters9. Hitherto the Budget of the International Labour Organisation has beenincluded in that of the League of Nations. This year, for the first time, and thiswill continue until other arrangements are made with the United Nations, it hascharge of its own finances. The Conference adopted the net expenditure Budgetfor 1947 at a total of 15,952,980 Swiss francs as compared with the 1946 Budgetof 11,521,510 Swiss francs. The approved figure is no more than the I.L.O. needsfor its expanding work. Despite the increase in the total Budget, the UnitedKingdom contribution will increase only from 1,412,709 gold francs in 1946 to1,579,319 gold francs in 1947.Credentials of Greek Workers10. The credentials of the Greek workers&apos; representatives were challengedby the British workers on the ground that the Greek Government in appointingthese particular representatives had not fulfilled the provisions of the I.L.O.Constitution which require agreement with the most representative organisa-tions of workers, if such exist. The attempt to unseat the Greek workers failed,the Conference supporting by 40 votes to 36 the majority report of the CredentialsCommittee signed by the Government representative (Mr. Amado of Brazil) andthe employers&apos; representative (Mr. Erulkar of India). The workers&apos; representa-tive (M. Jouhaux of France) signed a minority report finding against the GreekGovernment. The British Government representatives, on instructions, voted withthe majority.  There were a very large number of abstentions.Chairmanship of the Governing Body11. Finally, I should report that, as my colleagues may already be aware,Mr. G. Myrddin-Evans was re-elected Chairman of the Governing Body of theInternational Labour Organisation for the ensuing twelve months, the StandingOrders which make the Chairman ineligible for immediate re-election beingsuspended for the purpose.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S. W. 1,18th November, 1946.APPENDIX ISpeech by the Minister of Labour and National Service to the InternationalLabour Conference September 1946For many years Ministers of Labour of the United Kingdom have readilytaken advantage of the privilege of addressing the Annual Conference of theInternational Labour Organisation. I did so in Paris last year at the firstConference to be held after the conclusion of hostilities.It is with special pleasure that I take advantage of the privilege to addressyou to-day in Montreal in this great Dominion of Canada. In the first place,Jt is always a pleasure to anyone from any part of the British Commonwealthto be able to address any gathering, especially an international gathering, inMother country of the Commonwealth. In the second place, all here present mustrecall with a deep sense of gratitude the efforts and the great sacrifice made7 Canada and her great contribution to the defeat of Nazism. I visited Canada1111941 and saw for myself, in Montreal, Hamilton, Toronto and Sorel, the great[32724] b 2
results, in the production of munitions, of a tripartite activity Government,employers and workers united to produce maximum results in the minimum&apos;of time.Thirdly, it was in Canada that the International Labour Organisation gainedsanctuary and found hope in the darkest days of the war when it became necessaryto remove from Geneva. It was Canada and Montreal and the University ofMcGill which provided a home and enabled the work to be continued. In yearsgone by, people from Europe seeking freedom and happiness turned their facesto the West, and many made their homes in Canada. There they found newhope, new inspiration, new ideals for those who were to follow in the years tocome. So, the International Labour Organisation came to Canada and wasenabled to continue its activities during the war, to grow more vigorous, morecourageous and more hopeful. Those of us who now come from Britain andfrom France and see the great nation that has arisen from the mingling togetherand intermarriage of the ordinary folk of our two nations must feel that wehave come to the home of our own son or daughter, where we will always bewelcome and where others of any nation who share our ideals of democracy andfreedom will be welcome also. To the Government of Canada, to its PrimeMinister and to its Minister of Labour, our President at this Conference, thereis owing a great debt of gratitude for their unswerving support of this Organisa-tion, to which so many of the hopes of the peoples of the world are committed.The year which has passed since the Paris Conference has been one of greatactivity internationally and nationally. Last year I brought to the Conferencefrom the British Labour Government a message of loyalty to the InternationalLabour Organisation and of faith in its destiny. To-day I renew that messageand add that, as every day passes, we in Great Britain and I am satisfiedthat here I speak for all parties in the State and for all classes of the people-are more than ever convinced in face of the difficulties and perplexities of thismodern, restless, suspicious and fearful post-war world, of the need for theInternational Labour Organisation and of the duty of supporting the ideas anddeveloping the spirit of co-operation Which it embodies.The International Labour Organisation has had a very busy year, but beforeI comment upon its activities let me express to Mr. Phelan the pleasure of theBritish Government that his long services to the Organisation and the confidenceof the Organisation in him have at last been recognised by the removal of thatanomalous adjective &quot; Acting.&quot;   I offer him our heartfelt congratulations.A cursory glance through Chapter III of the Director&apos;s most interestingReport gives an impression of activity and boundless vitality that only a vigorousand rejuvenated Organisation could undertake and show. I cannot attempt totraverse those activities completely, but to one or two of the items I desire tomake some reference.This is not the first Conference to be held this year. In April the ThirdConference of American States Members of the Organisation was held in MexicoCity, and in June a Maritime Session of the General Conference was held atSeattle. Both of these Conferences gave results which are full of importance forthe future of the Organisation and, in the case of Seattle, of hope for the personsto whom the Conventions passed at that Conference apply.The Seattle Conference was notable for two innovations in InternationalLabour Organisation practice first, the introduction into an internationalinstrument, for the first time, of an international minimum wage, and second,the provision recognising collective agreements as acceptable instruments forputting into effect the terms of a Convention. The British Government supportedboth these proposals, but in regard to the international minimum wage, whilewe view this matter with the utmost sympathy, there is one point which I mustmake quite clear. We do not in any way recede from our view that actual nationalstandards, as opposed to an international minimum, are best decided by meansof voluntary agreements between representative organisations of employers andworkers. With regard to the question of putting the provisions of Conventionsinto operation by means of collective agreements, the British Governmentrecognises that it may frequently happen that a member whose conditions areequivalent to or even better than the provisions of a Convention may, for sometechnical or other reason, be unable to undertake formal ratification of theConvention, and so may give the impression that it is not faithfully carrying outits obligations under the Convention. We accordingly have much sympathy withthe motive underlying this proposal, and will watch the experiment with greatinterest; but we must insist that it should be regarded as an experiment only,and be open to review in the light of experience.   In the view of the British
government, it is of the utmost importance to this Organisation, and to thoseffhom it exists to serve, that nothing must be done which would, in the slightest(to&apos;ee) weaken the sense of responsibility of members for carrying out the obliga-ijoiis which they undertake by their membership and by their vote in Conference.When I spoke to you last year, I ventured to comment upon the importance0f the constitutional changes which were necessary for the better functioning ofthe Organisation and for facilitating the establishment of a proper and fruitfulpartnership with the United Nations. Certain immediately essential changesin the Constitution, small in number but far-reaching in importance, wereintroduced by last year&apos;s session of the Conference. A number of additionalamendments are before the present session. The British Government is in generalagreement with these proposals, and believes that, if they are adopted, theOrganisation will be better equipped to carry out the purposes for which itexists and for co-operating with the United Nations and with other internationalorganisations in pursuit of common ideals.Perhaps the most striking and in some ways the most important event of thepast twelve months is the conclusion of a draft agreement bringing theInternational Labour Organisation into relationship with the United Nations.The British Government has never wavered in its belief that such a relationshipis essential to both organisations. The International Labour Organisationkilned at Versailles in 1919, and restated at Philadelphia in 1944, principlesliich later were incorporated in the Charter of the United Nations. But thereis here no question of rivalry. The two organisations have common ideals andrammon objectives, and for the attainment of these objectives each is essentialto the other. At the San Francisco Conference, and ever since, the British(Government have pressed for the establishment of a real partnership between theUnited Nations and the International Labour Organisation, believing that onlyin such a relationship can their common ideals be achieved. It is therefore amatter of the utmost gratification to the British Government that a draft agree-ment has been concluded which, when it is accepted, as I feel confident it willbe accepted by this Conference and by the United Nations, will constitute asubstantial advance along the path of international collaboration which must befollowed everywhere and in all spheres if this world is to be made safe for ourchildren and for our children&apos;s children. The Governing Body are entitled toyour warm commendation for their efforts. We rejoice at the spirit in which thenegotiations were conducted by both parties.During the year the first industrial committees have held their first meetings.Although they could only be of a preliminary nature, they have already doneenough to justify the hope placed in them by the British Government when thatGovernment proposed their establishment some two and a half years ago. Thereis a long programme of meetings of these committees during the next fifteenmonths, and I am sure that all members will watch with sympathy, understandingand hopefulness this further experiment in international collaboration.I would now, if I may, turn for a moment to matters in my own country.We, too, have had a year of much strenuous activity. The Government of whichI have the honour to be a member are engaged in carrying out a great experimentin the application of Socialist principles to the organisation of certain sectionsof our basic industries. We are doing this because we believe that in this waywe can make those industries and services more efficient, more productive and ofgreater service to the nation, while providing for the workers employed in themwore constant and better conditions of employment and a better livelihood. Ofcourse, I do not expect all here to agree with what we are doing, but I am certainthat in this experiment we shall have the interest of all of you and the sympathyof some.But outside controversial matters we have done much in the past year whichis along lines and in accordance with principles laid down in Resolutions,Recommendations or Conventions of this Organisation. We have, for example,Passed great measures of social insurance covering the whole of our population,which will ensure that our people will not suffer want by reason of illness,^voluntary unemployment, industrial accident, the loss of the family wage-earner, or old age.Last year I referred to the importance of the question of full or high levelsQf employment, and I make no apology for quoting again the phrase whichintroduced the British White Paper on Employment Policy in 1944: &quot;TheGovernment accept as one of their primary aims and responsibilities theMaintenance of a high and stable level of employment after the war.&quot; That wasan historic declaration, for, although similar principles appeared at about the[32724] b 3
same time in the Declaration of Philadelphia and were subsequently incorporate llin the Charter of the United Nations, it was, so far as I can discover, the first^occasion on which a responsible democratic Government, a Government reprelsentative of all political parties, gave public adherence to a policy which!represented a revolutionary change in the attitude of Governments to theirlresponsibilities in the matter of the provision of employment.Of all the questions dealt with by the International Labour Organisation^there is none of greater importance than the maintenance of employment, and&apos;although employment does not figure as a separate item on this year&apos;s agenda.I am glad that the Director has given us the chance of discussing it by includimso informative and comprehensive a chapter in his Report.I cannot, too, fail to express much gratification at the number of references&apos;in the Report to the various activities of Great Britain in this field, activitieswhich are in line with suggestions made by this Conference in its last two sessions.The British Government is faithfully carrying out its declared policy on employ-&apos;ment. That policy is based on an internal expansionist economy and the creationthrough collaboration between nations, of conditions of international trade which&apos;will make it possible for all countries to pursue policies of full employment totheir mutual advantage.An essential part of our economic planning for full employment is our man-power budget. Just as it is necessary to prepare a financial budget in order toplan our finances ahead, so we have found that to plan our production and oureconomy ahead we must prepare a man-power budget, We used this method inthe mobilisation of our man-power during the war and we are continuing it as&apos;a normal and regular feature of our economic planning for the future.An important element in the operation of any plans directed towards fulliemployment is the provision of training or retraining facilities for workers innew occupations. To-day that need is reinforced by the extreme shortage ofworkers with special skill who are required for the urgent tasks of reconstruction.Training has been a feature of the British Governments employment and man-power policy since 1920. We are now developing that policy on a large scale.Already at the end of July sixty Government Training Centres were in operationcontaining nearly 20,000 training places, and we plan to have over 100 Centreswith over 42,000 training places in operation by the end of this year. Thetraining covers many trades, but for the present most of the training is for thebuilding industry, where our need for skilled workers is critical. With thewholehearted co-operation of the employers and the trade unions, we are trainingbricklayers, carpenters, plasterers, tilers, painters and other craftsmen in twentymonths where training previously took five to seven years.We are making a special feature of the provision of employment for thedisabled. This is a matter with which the International Labour Organisation hasalways been much concerned. No subject commands greater sympathy from theBritish Government. Over a period of years we have been developing a policywhich is based on the one hand on re-equipping and retraining disabled workers,however their disablement arises, to take their place again in the field of employ-ment, and on the other hand on ensuring that employment is available for themwhen they are ready for it. Training takes place in ordinary GovernmentTraining Centres or in special centres. We have invited all disabled persons toregister, and we have already a register of over 600,000. From 1st Septemberemployers have been required to employ 3 per cent, of disabled persons. Idaddition, only registered disabled persons may be employed as. elevator operatorsand car park attendants. Further, occupations may be designated for thispurpose. Moreover, to deal with the more severely disabled who cannot taketheir place in ordinary industry, we are providing Government workshops wherethese severely disabled men and women can do a job at their own pace at thestandard rate for the job. We believe that what we are doing for the disabledis one of the most constructive pieces of work that any Government can do. Itwill bring renewed hope and a fuller life to hundreds of thousands of our fellowcountrymen.We have progressed far in our transition from a war to a peace economy.At the same time we have been able to free industry and to free the people frommany of our war-time controls. A limited measure of economic control is beingmaintained controls over materials and prices and also, to a very small extent,some labour controls. All our major labour controls have been swept away, anathose which we have had to keep, for the time being, are limited to coal-mimn8:agriculture, the building trade and the building materials industries allindustries in which we have an acute shortage of labour.
At the end of the first year of reconversion we find ourselves further onthan we expected a year ago. We have received 3 - 75 million men and women 99-?from the Forces out of a total of 5,100,000, and at the same time the numbers Chi.engaged on the production of munitions and other supplies for the Forces havefallen from just under 4 million to less than f million a drop of over3 25 million. During the year over 1 million have left either the Forces orindustry and have gone back home most of them married women. But in spiteof the fact that over 6 million men and women have come on to the labour marketduring the year, unemployment has only risen by just over \ million, and atpresent stands at about 360,000. This is much less than we expected, and, whatis very significant, instead of going up steadily as we thought was inevitablein view of the large numbers being&apos; released, the numbers unemployed haveremained practically stable throughout the last six months. The dislocationarising from the transition from war to peace has been much less than we antici-pated, and the measures which we have planned to counter unemployment measures which include the development of new industries in certain areas wherewe anticipated that unemployment would arise will, we feel sure, result inemployment being maintained at a high level throughout our country.One of the main reasons why we have been able to go so far is because, inthis period of change-over and reconstruction, we have been so greatly helpedby the absence of serious industrial strife. In Great Britain we have had manyyears&apos; experience of industrial negotiation. Frequent contact between repre-sentatives of management and workers has created a desire to understand, aresolve to negotiate, a will to reach agreement, and an intention to honour theagreement. In the comparatively few instances where the parties directlyconcerned fail to reach agreement, a third party the Government steps quietlyinto the picture. The Minister of Labour knocks at the door of the conferenceroom and says &apos;&apos; Here I am, please let me know if I can help you &apos;&apos; but Iemphasise that experience has convinced successive British Governments thatindustrial settlements freely negotiated lead to a minimum of industrialdiscontent and to improved production.It is the aim of the Government of Great Britain, acting through this estab-lished procedure, not merely to maintain the existing level of living conditions,but to seek to improve them. We hold the opinion that that can be done only byraising and not depressing the standards of other people. That, in brief, can alsobe stated as the aim of the International Labour Organisation, which seeks tobring about its purpose by the partnership through tripartite action of Govern-ments, employers and workers action not based upon coercion or force, butarising out of understanding and confidence, following frequent and friendlycontact.The development of the tripartite partnership in Great Britain has not beenconfined to matters of industrial negotiation. During the war, a Joint Committeeof the Trades Union Congress and the British Employers&apos; Confederation, withthe Minister of Labour as Chairman, has been consulted on all matters affectinglabour the mobilisation of our man-power, labour controls, the supply of labour,training, welfare. The Minister of Labour has carried both sides (the employersand the unions) with him on all these matters. This tripartite system hascontinued during this year of reconversion and will not only continue in thefuture but will be further developed. We in Britain, therefore, are carrying outthe conception on which the International Labour Organisation is based theprinciple of tripartite partnership and co-operation. It is only by gettingtogether, co-operating with each other, even at some sacrifice to ourselves, that theaims and ideals of the International Labour Organisation can be achieved. If wecan do that, then we shall have gone a long way towards achieving prosperity andhappiness for the peoples of the world.The delegates to this great conference have come here from all over the world.Why? Surely it is because each Government hopes that its participation in theaffairs of the International Labour Organisation will be of value to its own people,either by raising their present standards of life, or by preventing those standardsbeing lowered by selfish or even thoughtless action by or on behalf of the people ofother lands.You, the members of this conference, will in due course return to your owncountries and to your own homes. To all of us, &apos;: home &quot; is a word that meanseverything worth having. Your departure must not be a mere dispersion of thepersonnel of this great organisation; it must be a distribution, a spreading out,a broadcasting of the seeds of good industrial relationship over wider pastures.Thereby, all who help to produce shall be entitled to share in an ever-increasing
harvest, a harvest not merely of commodities or bank balances, but of humanhappiness, the happiness that comes to people living happy lives, an existencewhere the only atom than can agitate the human race will be the tiny atom ofhumanity born into a future when the people of the world will know that to thembelongs the real freedom the freedom of the individual and the true brotherhoodof man.APPENDIX IIList of the United Kingdom DelegationGovernment Delegates :Mr. Guildhaume Myrddin-Evans, C.B., Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Labourand National Service, Chairman of the Governing Body of the InternationalLabour Office.Sir Arthur Dawe, K.C.M.G., O.B.E., Deputy Under-Secretary of State, ColonialOffice.Substitute Delegate and Adviser :Mr. Cyril George Dennys, M.C., Under-Secretary, Ministry of Labour andNational Service.Advisers :Mr. Ernest William Barltrop, D.S.O., O.B.E., Regional Controller, Ministry ofLabour and National Service.Mr. Robert Ritchie Bowman, C-B.E., Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Labour,Northern Ireland. &apos;Mr. Wilfred Barrett Bradshaw, Assistant Accountant-General, Ministry ofLabour and National Service.Major G.
