(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT7o OSECRET COPY NO.     C7^CP. (46 ) 40529TH OCTOBER,   1946CABINETINTRODUCTION OF A PERMANENT SCHEME OP NATIONAL service memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service it was agreed at the meeting of the Cabinet on24th October (minute 4(3) CM. (46) 90th Conclusions) that consideration of the subsidiary questions set out in paragraph of the Prime Minister&apos;s memorandum CP. (46) 380 should be resumed at an early meeting.      I should like to bring to thenotice of my colleagues the following points relating tocertain of these questions.(d)    Should medically unfit men be required to undertakesome other form of national service?This sub-paragraph states&quot;The standard of fitness which would beapplied in calling; up men to the Forces wouldbe that in force during the war.      Thus onlymen who were totally unfit would be exempt.&quot;It seems desirable to avoid any misunderstanding which might arise out of the use of the words &quot;totally unfit&quot;.In accordance with the National Service (Armed Forces)Miscellaneous Regulations,   1939 - S.R.   &amp; 0.   1939, No.   1120 -every person examined by a Medical Board is placed by theMedical Board into one or other of the following categories:Grade I.  - Men who, subject only to such minordisabilities as can be remedied or acl.eq_ua.telycompensated by artificial means,  attain the fullnormal standard of health and strength and are capable of enduring physical exertion suitable totheir age.Grade II.  - Those who, while suffering fromdisabilities disqualifying them for Grade I,  donot suffer from progressive organic disease, havefair hearing and vision, are of moderate musculardevelopment and are able to undergo a considerableamount of physical exertion not involving severe strain.      Where a man has been placed in thisgrade solely on account of either defects ofv i s u a 1 acuity or of deformities of the lowerextremities,  or both,  the letter (a) shall beinserted after the grade.

Grade III.  - Those who present such marked, physicaldisabilities or evidence of past disease that  theyare not fit for the amount of exertion requiredfor Grade II.Grade IV.  - Those ,who suffer from progressive organicdisease or are for other reasons permanentlyincapable of the kind or degree of exertionrequired for Grade III.It has not been the practice during or since the war to callup men placed in Grades III or IV.I suggest that for this purpose the words &quot;totallyunfit&quot;  should be regarded as covering men placed in Grade IV.with regard to those in Grade III they should remain liableto be called up, but should only be called upon to the extent that the Services would be able to make use of them on sedentary-duties for which they might be suitable.      The reasons forwhich the Defence Committee recommended that men unfit formilitary service should not be made liable for any other formof national service are I think,  overwhelming.(e)   What form of national service should conscientiousob ,lectors-be required to undertake?In this sub-paragraph it is stated:-&quot;It seems clear that in fairnessconscientious objectors must be compelledto undertake some other form of nationalservice. 11If this means that all conscientious objectors shouldbe subject to such compulsion, it represents a departure fromthe practice which has obtained since 1939 and for which boththe Military Training Act and the National Service Acts made provision, whereby a man might be registered as a conscientiousobjector without conditions.      mhe National Service Acts,  1939and 1941 provide that local or appellate tribunals,  ifsatisfied as to the grounds of the application, shall directeither -(a) that the applicant shall, without  conditions,be registered in the register of conscientious objectors;    or(b) that he shall be conditionally registered inthat register until the end of the present emergency,  the condition being that he mustuntil that event undertake work specified by the tribunal,of a civil character andunder civilian control and,  if directed bythe Minister,  undergo training provided or approved by the Minister to fit him for such work:    or(c) that he shall be registered as a person liableto be called up for service but to be employedonlv in non-combatant duties.

There would undoubtedly he very strong opposition, both in and outside Parliament,  to any proposal to abolish unconditionalregistration, and to attempt to do so would be likely to provoke a first class conflict with the Churches.      There ismuch to be said for leaving unchanged the existing well-established arrangements which have been so generally acceptedby all responsible interests as a satisfactory solution ofthis difficult problem.      The total number of men registeredby tribunals as conscientious objectors is not likely to exceed 400 a year,  and past experience suggests that only about 30 of these would be granted unconditional registration.This small number would be those who have succeeded insatisfying a Tribunal that they have a genuine conscientiousobjection to service of all kinds.      They would not in factserve if the attempt were made to force them and the only result would be that they would go to prison.A^c-v*c      r-vctV   An&amp;W &quot;&quot;waMinistry of Labour and NationalService, S.W. 1.29th October,  1946.
