THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1946SECRET      - Copy No,CP. (46) 4081st November, 1946CABINETTRANSPORT bill memorandum by the Minister of transport in view of the pressure to introduce this Bill early in December for SecondReading before Christmas, I am circulating this memorandum (with the draftBill) to the S.I. (M) Committee and to the Cabinet, in the hope that the S.I. (M)Committee will commend it, with any necessary modifications, to the Cabinet.My proposals were outlined in S.I. (M) (46) 4 and CP. (46) 149; subsequently,the Cabinet approved CP. (46) 225 dealing with the C licence. The Bill as nowdrafted gives effect to those proposals.It is hoped to avoid a Hybrid Bill, and Parliamentary Counsel is in discussionwith the Public Bill Office on the point; I will report to my colleagues again ifdifficulties in this connection arise.Section A of this memorandum deals with those aspects of the generalscheme (apart from compensation) on which criticism is likely; Section B dealssolely with the basis of compensation to owners. A vertical line in the marginindicates those points on which I am particularly anxious to obtain the viewsof my colleagues. The Appendix indicates certain matters in which the interestsof other Departments are directly concerned.Section A. Scheme Generally.Part I establishes the British Transport Commission in which all transportproperties will be vested, and which will have the duty of providingor promoting an integrated system of inland transport; the Corn-mission is to be subject to general directions of the Minister, and isto be assisted in- the discharge of its functions by public authoritiesknown as Executives.Clause 1 (2). I propose that the Commission should consist of a Chairmanplus four others; in making appointments the Minister should not be limited tospecified qualifications. (Appointments to Executives Second Schedule, para-graph should be so limited.)Clause 2 defines in general terms ,the powers of the Commission as a statutory corporation. s.s. 1 (d) limits the hotel powers to what is primarilyrequired for passengers; any extension would involve specific reference in thelong title.s.s. 2 (g) enables the Commission to acquire by agreement interests in the holding companies which control a wide field of road passenger transport.s.s. 3 enables the Commission to carry on any activities inherited from anacquired undertaking even if they are not covered by s.s. (1); the principal,activities are the railway steamer services to the Continent, Ireland, &amp;c, andthe railway generating stations.Clause 3 sets out the general duty of, the Commission.Clause 4 is modelled on the Coal Act and confines the Minister&apos;s directions to those of a general character in relation to matters affecting the national interest.
s.s. 4 (a) requires the Minister&apos;s consent to the acquisition by agreement of statutory transport undertakings and is tied up with Clause 7 which gives theMinister power to modify enactments relating to such undertakers for the purposeof enabling them to enter into such agreements and the Commission to exercise their powers.Clause 5. If the national transport system is to be successfully launched,it is imperative that there shall be wide delegation and that initially, at anyrate, the delegation shall be on a functional, rather than a territorial, basis; hence the provision for four Executives- which, as the name implies, will be executantsof policy laid down by the Commission. They will be agents of the Commissionobliged to carry out their directions; but save as regards the Commission theywill act as principals, and their staff and all third parties Will deal finally withthe Executive (unless in the unlikely event a Court judgement is outstanding for14 days or upwards). This is a hovel conception, but it is, I think, a soundsolution. I propose (paragraph 1 of the Second. Schedule) that the members ofeach Executive shall be appointed by the Minister after consultation with theCommission. , -Clause 6 relates to the Joint Consultative Committee procedure, both inthe regions and at Headquarters. It is important to realise that a statutoryTransport Tribunal (Clause 70) will be available to settle disputes on charges and facilities, but there are many matters which can be usefully discussed in amore informal manner and settled without recourse to legal procedure; theCommittee will assist in keeping the Commission in touch with public and commercial feeling. The Consultative Committee procedure will, I hope, becomevirtually a part of the Commission^ own organisation, though I propose anindependent Chairman of each Committee.Clause 8. Additional land for railways, docks, canals, &amp;c, will generallyhave to be acquired under Private Acts (which authorise charges and exonerateany nuisance) and compulsory purchase orders will therefore be mainly forgarages, offices, &amp;c. I do not feel justified in asking for the quick-entry powers for these purposes available under Section 2 of the Act of 1946.Clause 11 follows the precedent of the Coal Act in extending the period of limitation for action against a public authority from one to three years.Part IIj transfers to the Commission on the 1st January, 1948, the railwaysand canals which were (and will remain till then) subject to control under Defence Regulations.Clause 12 is designed to create a &apos;&apos; class &apos;&apos; of railway and canal undertakings(including the London Passenger Transport Board) which can be treateduniformly and can be compulsorily acquired without attracting the Hybrid Billprocedure. The &quot;class&quot; is defined by inclusion of those which were, and stillare, subject to control under Defence Regulation 69. s.s. 2 (b) and (c) are intended to include a number of railways generally closely connected with themain lines, but whose precise statutory position may not be clear.s.s. 3 has the effect of excluding from transfer the Eishguard and RosslareRailways and Harbours Company which owns one mile of railway in Wales and100 miles in Eire; and the Bridgewater (Canal) Department of the Manchester- Ship Canal.Clause 13 transfers the complete undertakings (with property and cash) tothe Commission, which, assumes all the rights and liabilities.Clause 14 is a complicated provision relating to disclaimer of improvidentcontracts made after the Lord Presidents announcement on the 19th November,1945; while it is unlikely to have much relevance to most railways and canalsit will be important in the case of road haulage undertakings and it would beinvidious to draw a distinction &quot;between the two classes (cf. Clause 42).It will be appreciated that in view of the transfer to the Commission ofrailway and canal undertakings lock-stock-and-barrel, disclaimed contracts would no doubt be regarded in law as frustrated; but it may well be otherwise in thecase of road haulage undertakings where a part only of the undertaking maybe transferred. It is therefore considered that the Bill should provide the general principle of frustration in all these cases, although it is realised that this rulemay impose a hardship in some cases on the other party to the contract; if,
however, the rule were not applied, hardship might well result to the transferorand on balance I think this would, in general, be the greater hardship.Provision is made for reasonable payment by the Commission for any goodsor services accepted by them between the date of transfer and the disclaimer.Clause 16 is machinery relating to distribution of stock; s.s. 2 is based onL.P.T.B. model.Clause, 17. As part of the protective &quot;machinery (c/. Clause 18), this clauseputs a stop on all interest and dividend payments after the passage of the Act(except interest on debentures and analogous prior charges).   If the Bill passesin late July or early August, 1947, the interim dividends of the four mainline companies are likely to have been paid, and there will therefore pass tothe Commission on the 1st January, 1948, the net earnings (about  10,000,000)in the second half of 1947 due to be paid to the proprietors early in 1948.. - - . . .Clause 18 is designed to provide the companies with a fund out of whichthey can pay interest on prior charges accruing before the date of transfer,defray any liability in respect of disclaimed contracts and compensation todirectors, and make a distribution to stockholders in lieu of the dividends theywould be losing between the passing of the Act and the date of transfer, whilstat the same time protecting the Commission against unreasonable actions by thecompanies prior to the transfer.   By s.s. 2 the sum of the fixed annual payments under the Control Agreements during a &quot;final period,&quot; plus the net revenues of the excluded undertakings, less interest on prior charges and less dividendspaid, are to be certified, and the balance paid to the companies.   The dateof this &quot; final period &quot; is important; it should properly run from the 1st July,1945, to the 31st December, 1947, and this would have the effect of reducing,for example, the payment to the L.M.S. by the  500,000 paid out of reserves in respect of 1945, and by any other dividends not covered by current earnings.I propose in the Bill to insert the 1st July, 1945, but to accept an amendment,if moved, to insert the 1st January, 1946.Against the sum payable to the company, the first charge will be in respectof disclaimed contracts, then debenture interest, then compensation (if any) todirectors, then distribution to shareholders, and any balance (only likely in thecase of public bodies such as the Lee Conservancy Board) to the Commission.The delay in getting the profits distributed for the second part of 1947 will undoubtedly be subject to criticism,, but a scheme on the lines of that in Clause 18is, I am satisfied, the best means of protection against deathbed dividends;provision will be made for payments on account.It has been suggested that the size of the fund built up by Clause 17  10,000,000 may be insufficient protection against deathbed dividends, andthat provision should be made for reducing the amount of compensation if this contingency occurs. I should be most reluctant to include such provision; first,it would suggest, and in fact emphasise, that the basis of our compensationproposals was wrong; secondly, it would be regarded, as an affront by directorswho have not given any grounds for suspicion. I should, however, like theauthority of my colleagues to state categorically if the point is raised, that ifunjustified deathbed dividends are declared before the Bill is passed, theGovernment would introduce a clause authorising reduction of the compensation payable to the stockholders who had benefited. If, despite the Act, payment ismade after its passage (the directors would then be subject to a substantial fineand/or imprisonment and made personally liable) the Government would introduce immediately fresh legislation.Clause 21 requires the railway and canal companies to wind up when thefinal distribution has been made.Clause 23 requires that the undertakings shall continue to be properlymanaged pending transfer; if not, the amount of damage shall be deducted fromthe earnings for the final period.Clause 25 transfers the Caledonian and Crinan Canals (now worked at a loss) from the Minister to the Commission.Clauses 26 to 30 transfer to the Commission about 580,000 privately ownedrailway wagons which have been requisitioned by the Minister since September1939. For upwards 100 years a trader has had a right to use his own wagonsfor his own traffics on British railways; this has frequently been of convenienceto the trader in that he has a movable warehouse for his goods (generally coal).Furthermore, wagons have some advertising value.   The use of these wagons,
however, is not conducive to proper railway working and Britain is the onlycountry where the wagons have not in recent years been under the direct controlof the railways; war-time experience has indicated that common user is essential.In addition to the 580,000 wagons mentioned above, there are about 20,000wagons of specialised types mentioned in the Fifth Schedule. This relatively small number of wagons has not been requisitioned during the war and I seelittle reason why the Commission should have forced upon it a monopoly ofproviding wagons of these particular types which, in general, require specialloading and discharging appliances and special care in their cleansing andmaintenance. (These wagons cater for traffic analogous to the &quot;excludedtraffics &quot; for road haulage of. Clause 35 (2).)I have reached the conclusion that, if the Commission is to be put inpossession of an adequate transport system, the right to operate privately ownedwagons for other than a strictly limited class of specialised traffics can no longer be justified and I propose, therefore, that the whole of the 580,000&apos; wagons shouldvest in the Commission with the railways.The owners&apos; rights in a number of these requisitioned wagons will have passed to the National Coal Board from the colliery companies under the CoalIndustry Nationalisation Act, 1946. (It, is understood that the- Board willgenerally have paid for these wagons on the basis of willing seller-willing buyer.)There is a point of general application to which I must specially invite theattention of my colleagues; many of the privately owned wagons (there are about30,000 separate owners) are subject to mortgages or similar encumbrances. Thequestion is to whom the compensation is to be payable. A similar point arises in connection with the road haulage undertakings (cf. Clause 45).Under the London Passenger Transport Act compensation was paid to the companies, whosettled with the mortgages; it was known during the passage of that Bill precisely who wouldbe acquired and the mortgagee could take steps to protect his interests.In the Compensation (Defence) Act, 1939, the compensation was payable to the owner andthe sum was deemed to be comprised in the mortgage; in this case the owner had little chanceof escape abroad. A similar provision is included in the National Health Service Bill in respectof hospital property other than land, but in the case of this type of equipment there is, I imagine,little risk of dishonesty. The exact legal effect of a provision of this kind is doubtful in view ofthe characteristics of a mortgage of land for instance, which are inapplicable to what may be asum of cash, and of a pledge of a chattel, which would not seem capable of following a sum of cash in the hands of a person other than the pledgee.In the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act provision is made in Section 20 for regulations todetermine the recipient of compensation.   These regulations have not yet been made.In the Civil Aviation Act (Third Schedule) the mortgagee may claim to have the paymentrepresenting his interest made to him; in this case the property can be readily identified.In the case of privately owned railway wagons, and, in particular, of road-haulage undertakings, many of the owners are financed with borrowed capital and my colleagues will wish to consider, in effecting compulsory transfers on thescale now envisaged, what protection should be given to encumbrancers.While a great deal of work will be involved for the Commission inascertaining what encumbrances exist, I propose in Clause 28 of the Bill that,where the transferred property is subject to a mortgage, the compensation shouldbe paid to the encumbrancer who has priority; it does not seem to me right thatthe effect of nationalisation should be to put secured creditors in peril, and unless some provision on the lines I indicate is included we should, I anticipate, meetstrong opposition from the Banks who will, in general, be the first encumbrancers.Clause 31: The Railway undertaking of the Commission will be subject tothe Railways (Valuation for Rating) Act, 1946, during the current quinquennium;thereafter it is proposed that the cumulo principle should apply and that theMinister of Health and Secretary of State for Scotland should be empoweredto make an Order effecting any necessary modifications to the Railways (Valuationfor Rating) Act, 1930. This will ensure that rates will be collected in respectof the railways, but it is, I think, inevitable that general legislation should be passed at a fairly early date dealing with the valuation of this and othersocialised industries.Clause 32 enables the Commission, with a view to securing the better- use ofa canal, to prohibit (except under licence) canal carriers from operating for hireor reward.  A right of appeal to the Transport Tribunal is given.Clause 33 would enable the , Commission to shorten the procedure forabandonment of a canal and to authorise the use of the site for purposes otherthan navigation.
Part III&apos; relates to road haulage; clauses 35 to 47 provide for the compulsory acquisition of undertakings wholly or mainly in the long distancefield;; clauses 48 to 49 impose a radius of 25 miles on independenthauliers, subject to permits from the Commission to go outside;clauses 50 to 52 impose a radius of 40 miles on the C licencees.-Clauses 35 to 37 relate to the compulsory acquisition of long distance road haulage undertakings; the proposal is that any undertaking which, during 1946,was predominantly engaged in the carriage of goods by road for hire or reward(whether measured by weight or revenue) for distances of 40 miles and upwardsshall be compulsorily acquired. I estimate that about 2,500 to 3,000 undertakingswith about 25,000 vehicles will qualify (in addition, there will be about 11,000vehicles of the railway companies engaged in collection and delivery servicesand a further 5,000 vehicles of Carter Patersons, Pickfords and other haulagecontractors which will be taken over with the railways).I regard it as essential that compulsory acquisition shall relate to &apos;&apos; under-takings &quot; and not to parts of undertakings. This means that a small firm inthe long distance field is due for acquisition, whereas a much larger firm whoseshort distance operations predominate, but whose quantum of long distancework may be larger, will not be subject to compulsory acquisition.It is not proposed to acquire compulsorily those haulage undertakings whidhwould qualify on the 40 mile basis if they are largely engaged in the carriage of liquids in tanks, household furniture, meat and livestock and heavy indivisibleloads. The characteristic common to all these types of carriage is that specialisedfacilities and handling are required and while there may doubtless be scope forco-ordination, that would not be achieved by requiring the Commission to acquireonly those operators of these specialised services who are in the long distancefield (and few would qualify). In addition to the general argument there arethe following special arguments : Liquids in tanks. Beer, oil and milk are mainly affected; special cleansing is necessary;Furniture Removals. The Commission does not require a monopoly in the field of thebona-fide household removal.Meat and livestock. This is highly specialised and, in the main, short-distance carriage;collection from farms cannot readily be integrated with other movements.Abnormal indivisible loads. This work is mainly for relatively short distances and therewould be a definite disadvantage in a split between long and short distance work: no advantage would be secured by giving the Commission a monopoly of the long distance work.It must be emphasised that while these traffics will be excluded from thecomputation of what constitutes long distance carriage (and consequentiallymust be exempted from the 25 mile radius for hire or reward, and when appro-priate from the 40 mile radius for the C licencees) there is nothing in the Billto prevent the Commission from undertaking the carriage of these traffics forlong or short distances if it so sees fit; in any event, it will acquire, throughthe railway companies and othenvise, a number of vehicles suited for these purposes.Clause 38. This relates to the firms which were in, or associated with, theRoad Haulage Organisation during the war; they entered that Organisationvoluntarily in 1943 and were engaged mainly on long distance work till controlceased on the 17th August, 1946. It seems unreasonable that these firms shouldbe compulsorily acquired by virtue of an agreement made some years ago andit is therefore proposed that the Controlled Undertakings should have an option of coming in if they wish or, alternatively, of having the calculation based ontheir activities after control ceased and they were free to choose the scope and nature of their operations.Clause 41. The properties to be transferred are the vehicles and what washeld for the purposes of their operation (including contracts).  No past liabilities.I are transferred or liabilities arising out of acts done before the transfer. ;Clause 42 enables the Commission to disclaim contracts in certain circum-rI stances; this is likely to give rise to some difficulty (cf. comment on Clause 14).Clause 45 corresponds to Clause 28 which relates to payment to encum-brancers.Clause 46 places an obligation on the transferor to keep his business efficientuntil the date of transfer.
y Clauses 48 and 49 impose a radius of 25 miles around the haulier&apos;s basewithin which he is free to carry goods for hire or reward, and outside which hecan operate only with a permit from the Commission; the Commission^ decisionon any permit is absolute and there is no. appeal. Any established haulieraggrieved by the refusal of the Commission to grant him a permit may requirethe Commission either to acquire his complete undertaking or, alternatively, totake over specified vehicles and specified assets. A permit once granted to an established haulier and accepted by him will run concurrently with the basiccarrier&apos;s licence unless terminated by the Commission by six months&apos; notice given before the end of each third year, and on such termination the haulier may require the Commission to acquire his undertaking or specified vehicles. (Itmay be necessary to amend these provisions slightly before the Bill is introduced.)It is estimated that about 22,000 hauliers with 50,000 vehicles will be ableto continue the bulk of their present operations without seeking a permit to gooutside the 25-mile zone. About 20,000 hauliers with 65,000 vehicles will almost certainly seek permits and I anticipate that the Commission will grant thesefairly freely in the initial stages for other than regular long distance work.Indeed, unless permits are freely granted trade and industry may well be adversely affected.Clauses 50 to 52 impose a radius of 40 miles around the base of the Clicensee with power to go beyond this with a permit from the Licensing Authoritywho must, however, consider the views of the Commission; there is appeal to theTransport Tribunal.Clause 51 (3) includes the point made in CP. (46) 225 about a special con-cession to the Development Areas.As my colleagues will be aware, the restriction of 40 miles on the C licenceeis one of the most controversial aspects of the Bill.Clause 54- It is proposed that the Licensing Authorities for goods vehiclesshall be subject to the same general directions of the Minister as can be given tothe same person acting in his capacity as Licensing Authority for public servicevehicles.Clause 57 exempts the Commission from the necessity of holding A, B, or Clicences; the effect is that the Commission will be able to carry goods for hire orreward by road anywhere and, in theory, could swamp the independent haulierin his 25-mile radius. The Commission, however, cannot be prevented by statutefrom entering the short-distance field as they will have to continue to operate therailway collection and delivery services and will have bought many undertakingswith some short-distance connections. It is likely that I shall be pressed to givea general Direction to the Commission that, save to this extent, they should refrain from competition on short hauls.Part IV provides for regional schemes to be made in future for the opera-tion of road passenger transport services (including those of themunicipalities) and of docks and harbours (including uncillaryactivities).Clauses 61 and 62. The Commission is to be required, after consultationwith local authorities concerned, to formulate regional schemes for the integration of passenger transport services; any such scheme must be submitted to theMinister, who, if he approves, is to make an Order giving effect to it, but ifobjection is made it shall not come into operation without &quot; special Parlia-mentary procedure.&quot;The scheme-making power is very wide and is intended to enable full advantage to be taken.of local circumstances; the body responsible can be either the Commission or any other established or ad hoc body or bodies; the scheme can provide either for the transfer of complete Undertakings or specified partsof undertakings or for an arrangement for the pooling of receipts, thus allowingexisting undertakings (including those of the municipalities) to remain in theirpresent ownerships. There is great diversity in the solutions which can beadopted and after full examination I am satisfied that no uniform pattern can, be laid down.Clause 63 relates to the Commission^ powers in regard to the running of passenger transport services; it is unlikely that it will wish to run such services in advance of the formulation of schemes, but it may be necessary to accept an
amendment in Committee protecting operators on the outskirts of the london passenger Transport Board area from being overrun by the Commission&apos;s servicesusing the L.P.T.B. organisation as a nucleus.I have carefully considered whether special powers should be taken to curtailor limit the long-distance road passenger services in direct competition with therailways. My conclusion is that little advantage would be secured by taking this step; the majority of these services are run as an integral part of the short-distance work of the major operators and to &quot;snipe off&quot; the long-distanceservices would involve heavy compensation for severance and leave the commission with no organisation with which to continue their operation. The long-distanceservices (which are relatively few in number) will fall into their proper perspectiveas the regional schemes come forward.Clauses 64 to 67. These clauses provide for regional schemes for harbourson lines similar to those for road passenger transport and form, I am satisfied,the only sensible solution. The schemes can relate not only to the physicalfacilities afforded by the existing dock authorities, but all the other facilitiesrelating to towage, drydocking, stevedoring, warehousing and handling of goods-operations which are now performed by uncontrolled private enterprise andwhich, in the past, have partly contributed to the casual nature of dock work.It is not proposed that schemes should relate to what are primarily fishery orpleasure harbours; but the Manchester Ship Canal would be eligible for inclusion.Clauses 68 and 69 establish a close liaison between the Commission and the coasting shipping interests who otherwise are not subject to the provisions ofthe Bill.Part Vj -sets up a Transport Tribunal to fuc rates and charges; provision is made for a new rates structure to be worked out by the Commis-sion in respect of all its services; this proposed structure is to beconsidered at a Public Inquiry and to become operative afteraffirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament.It is inevitable that for an initial period of several years the existing ratesstructure for the railways, docks and canals should continue more or lessunchanged. It is proposed to re-name the Railway Rates Tribunal the transport tribunal; and to transfer to it the vestigial jurisdiction over transport mattersstill exercised by the Railway and Canal Commission. (The number of transportcases which that Commission has heard within recent years is negligible.) TheDepartments concerned are considering the future of this Commission, whichis the only Court below the House of Lords with jurisdiction in both Englandand Scotland and whidh, as its transport functions have dwindled, has tended to acquire functions in relation to rating and mining subsidence. The transport tribunal so reconstituted will deal with questions of individual rates and charges;the general level of these charges must, I think, until matters become more settled,be the responsibility of the Minister and it is proposed to continue for an interim period the jurisdiction which he has exercised under Defence Regulations; in authorising any general change, however, he would doubtless invite the membersof the Transport Tribunal to investigate the matter on similar lines to the inquiryrecently held before the members of the Railway Rates Tribunal in respect ofthe general increase of railway charges.The main feature of Part V is the duty laid on the Commission (Clause 75)to formulate their proposals as to the principles on which charges should be levied for each form of transport under their control, and as to their obligations in respect of reasonable facilities, equality of treatment and the avoidance ofundue preference; these proposals would be submitted to an advisory committeeof five, consisting of a lawyer, as Chairman, appointed by the Lord chancellor and four other persons nominated by the Minister. This Committee would take evidence from interested parties and make their report to- the Minister. TheMinister would thereupon make an Order embodying the principles, and provide,if necessary, for the modification or repeal of the jungle of legislation 100 years old which surrounds railway charges. Such an Order would require affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament before becoming effective. Initially,the Order would only govern procedure and it would be some time after theprocedure operated before actual charges in accordance with the principles couldbe adopted. -Clauses 77 (1) (e) and 82 make provision for winding up the railway freight Rebates Fund.
The proposals in Part V go a long way to meet the demands of the tradingcommunity who periodically ask for an exhaustive inquiry into the basis oftransport charges. It is one of the recognised weaknesses of the recent road and rail propaganda that any agreed charges structure can hardly be made effective so long as ownership is divided. The basis of my proposals is thatunification of ownership comes first and that so soon as possible thereafter fullinvestigation is made into what the future rates structure should be.Part VI relates to the financial structure; compensation stock is to be guaranteed by the Treasury (see also Section B, paragraph 2).Clause&apos; 83. It is proposed that the Commission^ borrowing powers by theissue of stock should be  250,000,000. This is, inter alia, to replace approximately 200,000,000 unexhausted borrowing powers transferred from the railways,together with a liability to repay  60,000,000 to the Treasury loaned underStatute in 1936.It is proposed that the compensation stock (initially of the order of 1,100,000,000) should be guaranteed by the Treasury; future borrowings maybe guaranteed by the Treasury.Provision is made in Clauses 83 to 85 for the undertaking, property andrevenues of the Commission to be charged with the principal and interest of any british Transport Stock or of any temporary borrowing, including repaymentsto the Treasury of any advances made by them under the guarantee. The effectof giving a &apos;&apos; charge&quot; on a nationalised undertaking of this character andmagnitude is obscure and its practical value at best disputable. Nevertheless,the provisions follow recent precedents and imply recognition of the principlethat the Government, as representing the public, as well as the individualcreditors, have a final right to apply to the Courts for a Receiver. To omit any reference to a charge would cast doubt upon recent legislation and might prejudice the status of British Transport Stock and I am therefore in agreement with theTreasury that the clauses should stand as drafted. I think, however, that mycolleagues should be aware that, in practice, the provisions can mean little, andthey may wish to consider whether legislation should not be introduced in futurewhich will clarify the financial relationship of the State, as represented by theTreasury on the one hand, and semi-independent bodies running nationalised industries on the other.I would also refer to the fact that by Clause 22 the annual payments to alocal authority for the debt of a transferred undertaking are charged on theundertaking of the Commission. This will be welcome to the authorities in so faras it purports to give to them some security that the payments will in fact bemade. It leaves, however, unsolved the question what is to happen if theCommission have not enough money to meet their obligations and other creditorsenforce their charges. The local authorities, if they become aware of this point,would certainly claim that the payments to them should have in all circumstancespriority over, e.g., interest on guaranteed stock. I have myself some sympathy with the view, but the point is perhaps not of urgent practical importance andthe Bill, following what I understand to be the Treasury view, contains no provision giving them this priority.Clause 90. This would enable the Minister, with the consent of the treasury and from monies provided by Parliament, to make payments to the commission for works required in connection with the Defence of the Realm or for other special reasons.The Treasury would prefer that this Clause should be omitted; if it isomitted it should be clearly understood that unremunerative works and services required by other Departments will generally have to be borne on the votes ofthose Departments.It is for consideration whether, if the Clause in its present form remains, itshould be limited to works mainly required for strategic purposes.Part VII-relates to conditions of employment, pensions and compensation to staff.Clause 91 is based on the corresponding section in the Civil Aviation Actwhich was agreed with the T.U.C.&apos;&quot; &apos; Clause 92 makes the necessary modifications in the Railways Act.
Clause 93 makes the necessary.modifications in the Railways Act, 1921, onthe assumption that for these private police forces, as for the civil policegenerally, negotiations are not undertaken with unions of police.Clauses 94 and 95 give wide regulation-making powers to ensure that existing pension rights are preserved and future pension funds established. Asabout 1 million workers are likely to be transferred ultimately with all manner of differing rights, some power to make retrospective regulations seems inevitable.Clause 97 (Compensation to Staff) is intended to give effect to the decisionof the S.I. (M) Committee at its 11th Meeting on the 24th October. that committee (Conclusion 1 (6) ) agreed that no compensation should be payablewhere there was &apos;&apos; serious worsening of conditions leading to resignation.&apos;&apos;Nevertheless, I feel that it is difficult to maintain that an employee who is houndedto resignation by some drastic worsening of his conditions should not be entitledto compensation, and the words in square brackets in sections 7 and 8 are intendedto modify the effect of the S.I. (M) decision.The remainder of the clause gives substance to the Prime Minister&apos;s letterof the 16th June to the T.U.C., and I should be glad to be assured that if thisclause is inserted in the Transport Bill no more favourable terms will be concededto other socialised industries.Part VIII establishes a Transport Arbitration Tribunal to settle disputes arising under the Act in respect of compulsory acquisitions (except on contracts of personal service).It is proposed that in addition to settling disputed claims the tribunal should be required to confirm any agreed settlements involving a payment to anyone person of more than  10,000.Part IX. Miscellaneous.Clause 108. It is proposed that the functions now exercised by the LeeConservancy Board which relate to matters other than navigation should betransferred to the Lee Catchment Board.Clause 114. Public Records. In the Coal Act it was declared that alldocuments should be public records; for transport I regard this as unreasonableand propose that the minutes of the Commission and of the Executives and anyother documents of a class specified by the Master of the Rolls, the Treasury andthe Chairman of the Commission should be treated as public records.Clause 118. I have not seen my way to enable the Commission to acquire the steamer services to the Western Highlands and Islands. The commission will inherit the powers of the railway companies, together with the railwayinterests in the two steamship companies; to go beyond this would, I consider,rouse opposition from the coastwise shipping industry which the Lord Presidentstated on the 19th November, 1945, would not be nationalised. The problem ofthese Scottish services is primarily one of subsidising private enterprise to under -take unremunerative services a burden which, in one way or another, has fallenon Departmental Votes for upwards of 50 years. I see no reason why the Com-mission should be saddled from the outset with a drain of this character. I appreciate, of course, that similar arguments might be used in respect of Holy-head Harbour and the Caledonian and Crinan Canals now worked at a loss, andwhich by Clauses 65 and 25 it is proposed to transfer to the Commission; the justification in their case is that these undertakings have for a long time beendirectly operated by Government Departments, and now that an operative body for transport services generally is being set up it is right that these undertakingsshould be transferred to it.Section B. Compensation for Acquisition of Transport Undertakings1. The financial characteristics of the several groups of undertakings orassets to be acquired are more diverse in the case of transport than any of theother industries to be nationalised and my aim has been to produce a logical anddefensible scheme of compensation which recognises, on the one hand, the rightsof the dispossessed owners to reasonable compensation, and, on the other hand,the right of the State to benefit from the use of its credit.
The proposals in Part V go a long way to meet the demands of the tradingcommunity who periodically ask for an exhaustive inquiry into the basis offtransport charges. It is one of the recognised weaknesses of the recent road jand rail propaganda that any agreed charges structure can hardly be made effective so long as ownership is divided. The basis of my proposals is that Eunification of ownership comes first and that so soon as possible thereafter fulliiinvestigation is made into what the future rates structure should be.-   -       - ^ .        ;Part Vl-relates to the financial structure; compensation stock is to be I4       guaranteed by the Treasury (see also Section B, paragraphs).     IClause 83.-It is proposed that the Commission^ borrowing powers by the 1&apos; issue of stock should be  250,000,000.  This is, inter alia, to replace approximately I 200,000,000 unexhausted borrowing powers transferred from the railways, Itogether with a liability to repay  60,000,000 to the Treasury loaned under jStatute in 1936.It is proposed that the compensation stock (initially of the order of 1,100,000,000) -should be guaranteed by the Treasury; future borrowings maybe guaranteed by the Treasury.Provision is made in Clauses 83 to 85 for the undertaking, property andrevenues of the Commission to be charged with the principal and interest of any british Transport Stock or of any temporary borrowing, including repaymentsto the Treasury of any advances made by them under the guarantee. The effectof giving a &apos;&apos; charge&quot; on a nationalised undertaking of this character andmagnitude is obscure and its practical value at best disputable. Nevertheless,the provisions follow recent precedents and imply recognition of the principlethat the Government, as representing the public, as well as the individualcreditors, have a final right to apply to the Courts for a Receiver. To omit any reference to a charge would cast doubt upon recent legislation and might prejudice the status of British Transport Stock and I am therefore in agreement with theTreasury that the clauses should stand as drafted. I think, however, that mycolleagues should be aware that, in practice, the provisions can mean little, andthey may wish to consider whether legislation should not be introduced in futurewhich will clarify the financial relationship of the State, as represented by theTreasury on the one hand, and semi-independent bodies running nationalised industries on the other.I would also refer to the fact that by Clause 22 the annual payments to alocal authority for the debt of a transferred undertaking are charged on theundertaking of the Commission. This will be welcome to the authorities in so faras it purports to give to them some security that the payments will in fact bemade. It leaves, however, unsolved the question what is to happen if theCommission have not enough money to meet their obligations and other creditorsenforce their charges. The local authorities, if they become aware of this point,would certainly claim that the payments to them should have in all circumstancespriority over, e.g., interest on guaranteed stock. I have myself some sympathy with the view, but the point is perhaps not of urgent practical importance andthe Bill, following what I understand to be the Treasury view, contains no provision giving them this priority.Clause 90. This would enable the Minister, with the consent of the treasury and from monies provided by Parliament, to make payments to the commission for works required in connection with the Defence of the Realm or for other special reasons.The Treasury would prefer that this Clause should be omitted; if it isomitted it should be clearly understood that unremunerative works and services required by other Departments will generally have to be borne on the votes ofthose Departments.It is for consideration whether, if the Clause in its present form remains, itshould be limited to works mainly required for strategic purposes.Part VII relates to conditions of employment, pensions and compensation to staff.Clause 91 is based on the corresponding section in the Civil Aviation Actwhich was agreed with the T.U.C.Clause 92 makes the necessary modifications in the Railways Act.
Clause 93 makes the necessary.modifications in the,Railways Act, 1921, onthe assumption that for these private police forces, as for the civil policegenerally, negotiations are not undertaken with unions of police.Clauses 94 and 95 give wide regulation-making powers to ensure that existing pension rights are preserved and future pension funds established. Asabout 1 million workers are likely to be transferred ultimately with all manner of differing rights, some power to make retrospective regulations seems inevitable.Clause 97 (Compensation to Staff) is intended to give effect to the decisionof the S.I. (M) Committee at its 11th Meeting on the 24th October. that committee (Conclusion 1 (6) ) agreed that no compensation should be payablewhere there was &quot;serious worsening of conditions leading to resignation.&quot;Nevertheless, I feel that it is difficult to maintain that an employee who is houndedto resignation by some drastic worsening of his conditions should not be entitledto compensation, and the words in square brackets in sections 7 and 8 are intendedto modify the effect of the S.I. (M) decision.The remainder of the clause gives substance to the Prime Minister&apos;s letterof the 16th June to the T.U.C., and I should be glad to be assured that if thisclause is inserted in the Transport Bill no more favourable terms will be concededto other socialised industries.Part VIII establishes a Transport Arbitration Tribunal to settle disputes arising under the Act in respect of compulsory acquisitions (except on contracts of personal service).It is proposed that in addition to settling disputed claims the tribunal should be required to confirm any agreed settlements involving a payment to anyone person of more than  10,000.Part IX. Miscellaneous.Clause 108. It is proposed that the functions now exercised by the LeeConservancy Board which relate to matters other than navigation should betransferred to the Lee Catchment Board.Clause 114- Public Records. In the Coal Act it was declared that alldocuments should be public records; for transport I regard this as unreasonableand propose that the minutes of the Commission and of the Executives and anyother documents of a class specified by the Master of the Rolls, the Treasury andthe Chairman of the Commission should be treated as public records.Clause 118. I have not seen my way to enable the Commission to acquire the steamer services to the Western Highlands and Islands. The commission will inherit the powers of the railway companies, together with the railwayinterests in the two steamship companies; to go beyond this would, I consider,rouse opposition from the coastwise shipping industry which the Lord Presidentstated on the 19th November, 1945, would not be nationalised. The problem ofthese Scottish services is primarily one of subsidising private enterprise to under -take unremunerative services a burden which, in one way or another, has fallenon Departmental Votes for upwards of 50 years. I see no reason why the Com-mission should be saddled from the outset with a drain of this character. I appreciate, of course, that similar arguments might be used in respect of Holy-head Harbour and the Caledonian and Crinan Canals now worked at a loss, andwhich by Clauses 65 and 25 it is proposed to transfer to the Commission; the justification in their case is that these undertakings have for a long time beendirectly operated by Government Departments, and now that an operative body for transport services generally is being set up it is right that these under takingsshould be transferred to it.Section B. Compensation for Acquisition of Transport Undertakings1. The financial characteristics of the several groups of undertakings orassets to be acquired are more diverse in the case of transport than any of theother industries to be nationalised and my aim has been to produce a logical anddefensible scheme of compensation which recognises, on the one hand, the rightsof the dispossessed owners to reasonable compensation, and, on the other hand,the right of the State to benefit from the use of its credit.
2. The foundation of my proposals is that compensation is to be satisfiedin British Transport Stock, issued by the Commission, charged upon their under-taking, property and revenue and backed by a Government guarantee. Theamount of stock shall be such as is, in the opinion of the Treasury, of a valueequal oh the date of issue to the amount of compensation due; in practice theobject will be to issue a long-dated stock equal to par on the date of issue.3. Substitution of national for private credit will secure a substantialsaving in interest charges and while this entails a corresponding loss in income to the present owners, their new income will be correspondingly more secure andthey.will be at liberty to sell their British Transport Stock and re-invest in non^Government securities.4. In view of the three main variations in the scope of the acquisitions,i.e., that of a going concern lock-stock-and-barrel from private owners, that of individual parts or assets of a business, and that of an undertaking of a localauthority, there are three main bases of compensation : (a) maintainable net revenue, as reflected in market valuations or otherstandards of assessment (see paragraphs 5 to 9 below);(&amp;) net asset values plus some measure of compensation for severance and loss of profits (see paragraphs 10 to 17 below);(c) terminable annuities to a local authority to cover interest and sinkingfund charges (see paragraphs 18 to 21 below).5. For Railways and Canals, where the degree of integration is high;where the whole of the business is to be acquired lock-stock-and-barrel; wherelarge quantities of the physical assets have little or no value apart from theirusefulness for railway or canal purposes; and where there is a free and fully informed market in the stocks and shares, I have adopted market values as thebasis of compensation (Clause 15). I propose to apply this basis to the london passenger Transport Board and to give an option for its subsequent applicationto the acquisition of well-integrated businesses (such as certain omnibuscompanies and dock authorities) as and when they become the subject of futureschemes (cf. Sixth Schedule, paragraph 1 (1) (b)).6. The market prices adopted for valuation will be those ruling over a specified period, selected in agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I am also in touch with him about certain adjustments of this basis.7. On the assumption that the Commission will utilise national credit at-1%, the effect of my proposals would be to reduce the existing burden onthe railways to little more than one-half of the present figure; on the otherhand, railway stockholders would lose nearly one-half of their present income,the incidence of the loss varying from about 25% in the case of debentures,to over 75% in the case of equities. The degree of loss sustained by the latterreflects the fact that these stocks have been amongst the highest yielding equities(i.e., those regarded as most vulnerable) on the market.8. This loss is, in theory, justifiable on the grounds of better security, butthere will be many holders (such as retired persons, widows, or small life trusts)whose railway interest or dividends may be their sole (or major) income, who will suffer hardship. I suggest that the answer to them is that compensation on this basis should put them in a position to realise their British Transport Stock, andto re-invest. If they do not wish to do this, it is always open to them to maintain(or possibly increase) their present income during their lifetime by selling theirBritish Transport Stock and purchasing an annuity, either from an insurancecompany or from the Post Office.9.   Similar considerations apply to canals.10. For Road Haulage Undertae:ings where the process of integration hasnot yet developed and ownership is largely in the hands of small men; where inmany cases only parts of undertakings or blocks of physical assets are to be acquired; and where a large proportion of the assets (e.g., lorries, garages, andspare, parts) are, and will remain, readily marketable, I propose to adopt thebasis of net asset value (Clause 43). The physical assets will be valued at currentcost of replacement, less deductions for age and condition; but the allowance for loss of profit (two to five years&apos; purchase of profits according to standard ofmaintainability) and for severance is low and is, moreover, subject toreduction by an amount representing interest on the amount at which the physical assets are valued.   Were compensation for physical assets to be based
on original cost, it would be; impossible to resist a higher scale of compensationfor loss of profit. In thus limiting the allowance for loss of profit I haye notoverlooked Section 20 of the Road and Rail&apos;Traffic Act, 1933, which&apos;declaredthat the carriers&apos; licences under which the vehicles are operated do not confer on the owner any right to the continuance of any benefits from the licensingcontrol.There will, I expect, be a large number of cases in which a haulier will not qualify for compulsory acquisition initially, but whose activities in the long-distance field will be drastically curtailed. Under my proposals, such a hauliermay either require the Commission to acquire his whole undertaking on the termsoutlined above, or require the Commission to take over vehicles and any other assets rendered redundant. In the latter event he will remain in business as ashort-distance operator; it is clear that the Commission must pay the currentvalue of assets so transferred, but I should welcome the views of my colleagues as to whether the owner should be entitled, in addition, to either payment forincreased overheads, or payment for loss of one year&apos;s profit calculated by theproportion of the total capacity of the whole fleet of vehicles to the vehiclestransferred. On balance I prefer the former-the alternatives are shown in clause 49 (8) (b).11. I regard it is as essential that if we are to keep to a low multiplier for loss of profit, the compensation should be a capital sum not subject to tax;if this involves questions pertinent to the Finance Act, I hope the Chancellorwill be reassuring (cf. Clause 43 (9) ).12. Under para. 1 (1) (b) of the Sixth Schedule, the net asset basis may alsobe applied to road passenger transport undertakings coming within futureschemes, where appropriate; for example, to omnibus businesses not alreadycomprised in an integrated group of companies, or to undertakings where only part of the business or specific physical assets are to be included in the scheme.13. For Privately Owned &quot;Wagons where, again, there is no financialintegration within the group, and where physical assets only are to be taken over; but where there can be no effective market for the vehicles after the Corn-mission commences to function; where over 50 per cent, of the wagon stock is over35 years old, and 20 per cent, of it obsolete (over 45 years old); and where thewhole of the wagons to be acquired are (and pending acquisition will remain)under requisition by the Minister, I propose to adopt net asset values (Clause 27),but to limit them to cost rather than replacement as in the case of road vehicles.Compensation is to be based upon capital cost less allowance for fair wear andtear up to the date of acquisition and such compensation, together with the valueof the expired life (which I must assume to be already in the hands of the owneras money in depreciation or amortisation funds) will therefore be equivalent tothe capital originally invested.14. There is, in my view, no justification for any payment for loss of profit;in these wagons the Commission is buying a somewhat doubtful group of&quot; assets,&quot; and will have to scrap the majority as soon as they can be replaced by standard modern types. This means, amongst other things, that the increased cost of replacing the wagons will fall upon the Commission and not upon thepresent owners.15. I do not propose to take over private wagon-repairing shops. Therepairers are likely to press for compensation and it may be necessary to provide in the Bill for continuance by the Commission of wagon-repair contracts for alimited period, although this would be contrary to the precedent of Section 13 (3)of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919.16. In all the circumstances the equities of the case seem to me to be metif the present wagon owners are, in effect, reimbursed their loss of capital in theway I suggest. We are likely to encounter strong opposition from coalmerchants, and probably other interests deeply involved in owning, repairing orfinancing wagons, to the whole policy of acquisition, and anything that can bealleged to be inequitable in the proposed terms will accentuate this opposition.I am therefore disposed, rather than adopt original cost, to accept a formula of&quot; cost at August 1939 for wagons built up to that date, and original cost forwagons built thereafter.&quot; This was done in the negotiation of requisition hireterms and links with the requirement of the Compensation (Defence) Act that ifa requisitioned vehicle is acquired by the Government no account is to.be taken of any appreciation in value due to the emergency.
17. Where appropriate, the basis described above may be adopted for thepurpose of a future scheme, e.g., in the case of a dock undertaking with out-of-dateequipment which the Commission may wish to modernise (cf. para. 1 (1) (b) ofSixth Schedule).18. One of the canals to be acquired is owned by a Local Authority, viz.,Nottingham Corporation (Trent Navigation Committee). It is, so far as I.amaware, the first instance, throughout the Governments nationalisation plans sofar considered, of transfer from municipal to national ownership. In principle,although this undertaking is relatively small, the basis of compensation adoptedwill influence, not only the treatment of local authority undertakings to beincluded in future passenger road transport and dock schemes (cf. para 1 (1) (a)of Sixth Schedule), but also the treatment of the very much larger non-transportlocal authority trading undertakings which are to be nationalised, such aselectricity and gas. It is, perhaps, a pity that we have to raise in this Bill so large an issue on so small a case.19. Following the decision of Ministers about net outstanding debt, I have proceeded on the basis that the local authorities should be entitled to recoupmentof interest and sinking fund charges by the Commission until the existing debtliability on the undertaking transferred is liquidated (Clause 22); I propose, asan alternative, that the Commission and the authority may agree to accept anamount of transport stock. This was the arrangement laid down in the case ofcertain local authority tramways transferred to the London Passenger transport board.20. I would refer to what I said in Section A on Clause 85 regarding thesecurity of these payments to local authorities.21. It is obvious that no more favourable treatment than that adopted for local authority transport undertakings can be accorded to other municipal tradingundertakings to be included in subsequent nationalisation measures, and if theissue has to be joined on. the present Bill, we shall be bound to adhere to thesame arguments and policy in later Bills.Conclusion. My colleagues will be under no misapprehension about the volume of opposi-tion which the whole or various parts of the Bill will encounter.Loss of Income. A million railway shareholders, together with perhaps100,000 canal shareholders and owners of privately owned wagonswill find their incomes appreciably reduced.Road Haulage. Up to 3,000 undertakings will be compulsorily acquiredand 50,000 undertakings will have a net placed around them with little opportunity for expansion.&quot; C &quot; Licenoees. -Trade and industry generally will be vocal about therestriction but will, I expect, be relieved at the reasonable characterof my proposals.Wagon Owners will object to losing a facility.Local Authorities will, no doubt, dislike the compensation terms for theirtrading undertakings.Bus combines and Docks will probably complain about the uncertaintiesinvolved in regional schemes in the future.Trade Unions will regard the provisions for compensation to staff asungenerous.In spite of prospects of strong opposition from various interests, I am convinced that the present Bill does provide a sound frame-work within whichthe. British Transport Commission, assured of the active support of the Govern-ment, could provide an integrated system of public transport to&apos; the generalbenefit of the whole community. Some dislocation in the initial stages will be inevitable, but over a reasonable period of time I am satisfied that an efficientpiece of national organisation will be achieved.I seek the authority of the Cabinet to invite the Legislation Committee toconsider the Bill subject to minor and consequential modifications./ ....     , .v. . ..        , a. b.Ministry of Transport,1st November, 1946.
