tHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1946. -       105SECRET.CP.&quot;       409.30^ October, 1946.Copy No.CABINET.WAR OFFICE REQUIREMENTS  OF AGRICULTURAL LAND FORTRAINING PURPOSES.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.I am gravely concerned by the proposals put forward by the Secretary ofState for War in his memorandum CP. (46) 372 dealing with the War Officerequirements of land for training purposes. Those requirements are put at some5,000 acres of land in the United Kingdom. The great bulk of this. some700,000 acres -falls within England and Wales and involves the taking for themost part of agricultural land.2. It is clearly not within my competence to assess the need on defencegrounds to have such extensive areas permanently for training purposes in theUnited Kingdom. It is, however, my responsibility to assess the likely effecton agriculture and forestry of the permanent loss of&quot; such wide areas of land inEngland and Wales and to see that the interests of these two industries receivefull consideration.3. While I recognise that the War Office have endeavoured as far aspossible to select land of low agricultural value, nevertheless the scale of theirrequirements is such that it is bound to have severe repercussions on agricultureand forestry. Much of the land wanted is at present used for hill sheep farmingand is also the type of land potentially suitable for afforestation. The Govern-ment has accepted in the Hill Farming Bill the view that the hill sheep industrymust be put on a sound footing because of its economic importance to agriculture.The Government has equally accepted the importance as a defence measure ofgreatly increased afforestation in this country. A programme of the scalecontemplated by the War Office cannot therefore be discounted on the groundsthat it will in the main only affect land of low agricultural value since it is thistype of land which is needed for hill sheep and for forestry.4.   It is, however, not possible to assess what the exact effect of the WarOffice proposals would be until each of the suggested areas has been examined,a task which is at present being undertaken by the Inter-departmental Committeeon Service Land Requirements.   In my view, therefore, it would be wrong, andtfould prejudice the work of that Committee, if at this stage, before the proposalsave been properly examined, the Cabinet were to agree in principle that therejvas a necessity for the War Department to have training areas on the scaleroposed.   This view is, in my opinion, strengthened by the fact that, so fars I am aware, no decision has yet been reached as to the future size of thenned Forces.5. I do not think that it is generally appreciated what serious inroads areeing made into the very limited area of agricultural land available in thisountry. The total area of land in England and Wales amounts to some7 million acres, of which some 30 million acres still remain in agriculturalThe War Office requirements are not the only needs of the Armed Forcesor land. Taking into account the requirements of the other Service Depart-ents for airfields, bombing ranges, &amp;c, the total area of land wanted is likely0 be in the neighbourhood of 1 million acres. In addition large areas ofgricultural land are of necessity being taken for housing. During the lastW years over 100,000 acres have been &quot;cleared &quot; for release as housing sitesn England and Wales. When, in addition, the area of land wanted for newQwiis and other decentralisation proposals is added, it is estimated that we are[32627]
likely to lose about 250,000 acres of land during the next five years for housinoneeds alone. In addition large areas of land will be required for new roads0schools, factories and industrial trading estates, water reservoirs, civil aviation&apos;surface and underground mining, &amp;c. Every non-agricultural use of land ijextending and extending rapidly, with serious consequences to agriculture andforestry. ^ Much of this loss is inevitable, but I would strongly urge that \Veshould give very serious consideration to the question whether, from the pointof view of our national economy, we can afford to sterilise the very large acreageof land indicated in the War Office paper.6. I feel bound to suggest, therefore, that the War Office should seriouslyreconsider the scale of their requirements. In spite of the reasons advanced, jthink that further consideration should be given to the possibility of carrying outa far greater proportion of their training overseas. Nor do I feel that enou4attention has been paid to the possibility of using the more remote parts of theUnited Kingdom for training purposes. While such arrangements wouldadmittedly give rise to difficulties and inconveniences, I do not think that, havinoregard to our limited land resources, the possibilities should be lightly dismissed7. Moreover, while I am of course unable to comment upon the technicalgrounds upon which the War Office requirements of land have been based, itwould appear to the ordinary layman that the total acreage claimed is excessive.Apart from the four practical training areas mentioned in the memorandumthere are many other areas as large or larger included in the War Office scheduleof land needed for training purposes. For instance, the following areas, amongothers, are wanted : Thetford, 23,000 acres Armoured vehicle training area;Warcop, 40,000 acres Armoured vehicle training area; Okehampton, 60,000acres Field Artillery range. In addition, the War Office already own99,000 acres of land on Salisbury Plain, which is being used for training purposes.The War Office requirements are apparently based on the needs of four Divisionsto be stationed in this country, together with the Territorial Army. A requirement of 800,000 acres for training a body of men of this size seems to be very high.8. I would therefore urge very strongly that the Cabinet should not approvein principle the scale of the training areas proposed by the War Office, but thaton the contrary, the War Office should be asked to re-examine the whole problemwith a view to reducing substantially its needs for land in this country, and witha view also to finding such land as must be provided here in the more remote anduninhabited parts of the United Kingdom.T.
