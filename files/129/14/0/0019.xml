WINTER FUEL SUPPLIES FOR  INDUSTRYMemorandum prepared by Officials of the Ministryof Fuel and Power in conjunction with Officials_i______of the Board of Trade,-,________I, -   TIffi NATURE Off THE PROBLEMI- Last month consultations were starieil on theofficial level between the Minister of Fuel andPower and the Board of Trade on. the question of thesupply of fuel to industry during the winter, withthe object of securing that the allocations which itwill be necessary to make should be  substantiallyin line with the volume of supplies likely to beavailable *      Coal production at that time was (and stillis)  some 100,000 tons a week above the level of thecor re sponding period last year, but the position, isnevertheless extremely critical for although totaloutput in Septe her this year was 304 per cent higherthan in September, 1945.  consumption in the  same periodincreased by 4.4 per cent,,      Moreover we are furtherhandicapped this year by having to start the coalwinter with distributed stocks lower by 3 million tonsthan at the beginning of the coal winter last year.2. In our consideration, of the action, to be taken,we were guided by the following general principles,laid down by the prime Minister in a minute addressedto the Minister of Fuel and Power on 29th October;&quot;We must avoid running down stocks as much as we.can and this -points to the necessity of ensuringthat any further economies in comsumptionwhich are  still possible are brought into effectas quickly as possible.      To this end it isimportant that industrial consumers should beinformed of their allocations for the six monthsbeginning November 1st at the earliest possiblemoment,.      I hope therefore that you will presson with all speed with your discussions with theBoard of Trade *I&apos;take it that these discussions will cover suchpossibilities as the immediate curtailment ofdeliveries wherever coal consumption is out ofall proportion to the importance of the industrialprocesses affected;    and that the possibility ofsecuring indirect savings by economies in industrialconsumption of electricity and gas., particularlyby large undertakings, will also be explored.&quot;3. The position which we have  to face is brieflythat between now and the end of next April there is alikelihood that total requirements of coal will exceedsupplies by not less than 2 million tons and -perhapsby as much as 5 million, tons,.      Unless production canbe raised to an extent sufficient to bridge this gap,the only alternatives arc&apos;.;&apos;----

(a) to run the risks involved in. taking no action,in the hope that wo might be able to getthrough this iwinter without imposing anyrestrictions on consumption,  or(b) to introduce as from 1st be comber, 1946, acarefully balanced scheme designed to securethat the gap between estimated requirementsand estimated supplies should be substantiallybridged by eliminating all unnecessary - .consumption and,  in so far as might benecessary,  by curtailing consumption, particularlyby those industries which are less necessary toout gen.e ral e con omy,4. Alternative (a)  suffers from, the disadvantage that,if it were adopted,  the whole of the crisis which would beinevitable,  (if the assumption upon, which it is basedwere falsified by events), would be concentrated in ashort period of about twelve weeks extending from about  theend of January until the end of April.      On the other hand,alternative  (b) would secure that any reduction ofconsumption of coal by industry would be spread over aperiod of about 21 weeks. -    Clearly, therefore,  if there-is to be any unemployment this winter as a result of coalshortage,  its volume would be much more  severe underalternative (a) than under alternative  (b).5.       &apos; For the foregoing reason, and in view of the generalprinciples laid clown&apos; in the prime Minister&apos; s Minute, weset out to draw up a scheme which,  if introduced as from1st December, would bridge  the gap with the leastinterference to industrial activity.      We accordinglyentered into discussion with all the Departments concernedwith production and also with the national ProductionAdvisory Council on Industry, for we realised that anyscheme,  to be successful, would have to secure the supportboth of the Federation of British Industries and theTrades Union Congress.     Although our discussions wereconcerned in the first place with coal supplies,  itbecame apparent at an early stage that it would beinequitable - and unacceptable to industry - to applyI any economy scheme to coal alone, without regard also toI the industrial consumption of gas and electricity, for anyj such discrimination would be totally unfair as between one -industry and another and of ten between one firm and anotherI in a given industry.      Moreover a scheme which dealt onlywith the coal aspect of the problem would fail to secure&apos;economies of the necessary magnitude.6. Under decisions already taken, by the LordPresident&apos;s Committee,  iron and steel (including foundries)and coke ovens would need to be excluded from any schemeof economies.      We agreed also that it would be necessaryto exclude colliery consumption and railways,  canals andharbours from any scheme,  the first because no reductioncould be effected without adversely affecting the amountof coal raised, the  second because it is clearly necessaryto maintain essential transport services.      The fieldwithin which economies could be effected was thus 48 milliontons of coal maso up as follows:-

Enginocring 2* 66Other Industry 17.59Gas and Electricity    27.807. It appeared therefore  that if during the coalwinter we Were  to. secure economies in consumption ofthe order of 3 million tons, we should need to reduceconsumption by industry (including engineering) by-upwards of 2 million tons or about 10 per cent, whileobtaining the remaining 1 million tons for economies ingas and electricity,8. .       At the outset of our discussions wo wereattracted by the idea of leaving it to each of theDepartments concerned with production to find theiroverall share of the necessary economies, while givingthem a free hand in determining how the economies shouldbe distributed as between one industry and another and,within each industry,  as between each of the constituentfirms.      An arrangement on these lines would have hadthe advantage that it would have made it possible totake account of the relative importance to the nationaleconomy of all the industries and firms concerned.Very soon, however,  it becomes apparent that a schemeon these lines would be neither practicable noracceptable to industry;    it would have beenimpracticable because it would not have been possible towork out the details in time to apply the plan to theL/ecember allocations;    and it would have beenunacceptable, because  the representatives of both sides,of industry made it clear that,  in their view,  anyscheme should fall equally upon all industries and uponall firms and their workers, though they were willingto accept a short list of industries to be givenexceptionally favourable treatment if the Governmentconsidered it necessary.      Further both sides of industryexpressed the definite opinion that by increased fuelefficiency every industry could stand a 5 per centreduction of its coal allocation without appreciableloss of output.&apos;9, We found, moreover,   that the  two sides ofindustry were unanimously of the opinion that thenecessary economies could not be obtained on a voluntarybasis and that if economies in consumption were to besecured, a compulsory scheme would be essential.      Thisview was based upon the consideration that in a matterof this kind it would be impracticable to expect anundertaking to reduce its consumption voluntarily, whenit had no assurance that corresponding action was beingtaken by its rivals.10.        In the light of the  considerations  set out above,we drew up a scheme for securing, on a compulsory basisseconomies in the use of fuel during the coal winter1946/47 to the extent of between 2 and 3 million tons.We excepted fuel oil from the scheme, for clearly inexisting- circumstances we need to foster the substitutionof oil for coal&apos;to the greatest possible extent.      Themain features of the  scheme drawn up were as follows:-

(a)  Coal(i) The allocations to be made to industry for Decemberand the following months should be adjusted in thelight of probable total winter supplies.    Thiswould mean that after taking account of the  stockposition of each firm affected by the scheme,  theallocations to that firm would be reduced to therequired extent below what the allocation would havebeen, if coal supplies had not been a limitingfactoro(ii) The scheme would not apply at all to iron andsteel (including foundries)  coke ovens,  collieryconsumption,   canals and harbours,  (and smallconsumers who do not receive a weekly allocation).Railways come under a different programme andwould not be affected by the  scheme,(iii) The allocations for the five winter months to bemade to certain industries which,  in the opinionof the Departments concerned, were vital to thegeneral e con any would be reduced by 5 per cent,a reduction which the F.B.I.,  and. T.U. C.? agreecould be met from fuel economies and other savingswithout appreciable loss of outputu(iv) The allocations to all other industries would bereduced to secure an overall saving of 10 per centon the winter consumption previously contemplated,,This would be secured by a cut of 12-g- per cent ofwhich one-fifth (i;.e.  the diffcron.ee between10 per cent and 12-g- per cent) would be hold as a&quot;pool&quot; from which the-Regional Coal Officers,  inconjunction with the Regional Fuel AllocationCommittees, would be able to grant ad hoc concessionsto those firms &quot;which have a good fuel economy recordor to which for any other reason it was consideredessential to give special assistance.(v)  The arrangement decided upon,  expressed in terms ofweekly /-allocation, would be notified to allconsumers who would thus be able to plan howbest to make use of the coal which they would receiveweekly during the winter.(vi)   In order to ease the operation of  these changes,steps would be taken to reduce unnecessaryconsumption on space heating,  through action atthe regional level and through discussion at shopmeetings at factories,     (The Ministry of Labourhave agreed to assist by issuing to factoryinspectors a circular pointing out the need to payaccount to the coal shortage in enforcing thep r ov i si on s of the F a c t o r i e s A et.)(h) Gas and Electricity(vii) A general Direction would be issued to each industrialconsumer requiring him to secure that his consumptionof gas and electricity should be less by 10 per cenr.than the amount which (in each of the five monthsconcerned)  it would have been if i fc had not been for&apos; the Direction.

(viii) The Direction would place upon consumers theduty of keeping a record of the  saving to beeffected and the  steps taken to securethat end.      This record would be availablefor inspection at  any time.      Spot checks wouldbe taken to ensure the proper working of thescheme.(c) Co-operation by Industry(ix) F.B.I.  and the T.U, C respectively undertook toco-operate in every way in their power insecuring the  successful operation of this scheme.11.        The representatives of both sides of industry madeit clear that,  in their view, it was essential that, if theGovernment decided to adopt the foregoing scheme they shouldmake a public statement explaining its provisions..      Withoutsuch a statement neither the P.B.I. nor the T.U.C. would bein a position to give the promised support to the scheme.12.       Preliminary consideration was given to the  schemeoutlined, above at a meeting of  the Lord President:&apos;sCommittee held on Friday, 8th November (L.1.(46)  37thMeeting, Conclusion 5).      At the conclusion of that meetingthe Minister of Fuel and Power and the ParliamentarySecretary of the Board of Trade were invited &quot;inconsultation with all Departments concerned, to prepare arevised scheme for allocations to industrial consumers inthe winter 1946/47 and to &quot;&quot;submit it to the Cabinet&quot;.13.        On the instructions of our respective Ministers wohave accordingly reviewed the scheme in conjunction with theDepartments responsible for production, and with the Ministryof Health which is concerned from the point of view of thehousing programme, although responsibility for productionunder that programme rests with the Minister of Works.The results of this review may bo summarised as follows(i) The Ministry of Works and the Minister of Healtharc prepared to accept any economies which it maybe decided to impose, provided that those economiesfall exclusively upon the export sections of theindustries concerned.      Bxcopt on the foregoingbasis neither Department is prepared to agree toa 2.2-s per cent cut in fuel for cement and glass.Nor is either Department willing to accept the5 per cent reduction, in fuel allocations for futuremonths, for any of the industries engaged on theMinistry of Works1 programme*      They do not acceptthe view of the F.B.I.,  that through increasedfuel efficiency a reduction of this small amountcan be effected without appreciable loss ofoutput,(ii)  The other Departments concerned, namely the Board ofTrade, the Ministry of Food:,  the Ministry ofSupply and the Ministry of Fuel and Power (forheavy generating plant) made  it clear that theyare prepared to stand by the original plans,provided &quot;that it is applied to all Departments,  i itthat,  if the Ministry of Works programme were to

exempted (as urged by that Department and theMinistry of Health)  they would no longer bewilling to agree to that plan unless many oftheir industries also wore either totallyexempted or transferred from the 12-s per centlist to the 5 per cent list.(iii)lt seems clear to us that the choice lies between:-(a) maintaining unchanged the original list ofindustries to be given preferentialtreatment,  or(b) admitting so many additional industries to thelist of exemptions as to reduce  the economiesto be secured to an extent which would makethe  scheme not worth adopting.    &apos; (Note theF.B. I.  only accepted with great reluctancethe list of exemptions already drawn up,which they consider is far too long andoffends,  in their view, against the principleof equal sacrif icc.)(iv)  In view of the attitude of the Departments concernedand of the views expressed both by the F.B.I.  andthe T.U.C., we arc  strongly of the opinion thatno voluntary scheme would be effective or evenpracticable.      If therefore the consumption offuel by industry is to be regulated this winter,this must,  in our view, be done on a compulsorybasis.(v) ii/hile all the Departments regret the need for acompulsory scheme, we are convinced that,  ifthere is to be any scheme it will need, to be onthe lines already proposed.      The industriesincluded in that scheme for reductions of 5 percent and 12-g- per cent respectively of coal (thelatter being equivalent of the proposed reductionof 10 pier cent for gas and electricity)  are shownin the Annex to the present papier.      As alreadyexplained,  this list was originally accepted byall Departments, but this is no longer the case.In our opinion, however, this list commands thehighest measure of common agreement obtainableon the departmental level.14.        Wo feel that the  scheme could be -presented in a morepalatable manner than that suggested in the originalproposal.      We consider that it would be better - and morecorrect - to make j. 1; clear that what is proposed isthat allocations for future months should be made on a .realistic basis in relation to available supplies, and thatcuts are not being imposed on current allocations.      Thewhole scheme is in the nature of an insurance against whatmight be a most serious crisis early next year.      It isstill possible that by further improvements in outputcoupled with- a substantial improvement in the carriage ofcoal by rail  (if this can be achieved by the Minister ofTransport) we may be ablu to provide industry this winterwith larger supplies than now appears probable, more

especially if we are lucky with the weather and ifsickness among miners during the winter is low.      Put thesearc- not contingencies upon which it would be  safe to relyQUEST ION 3 OP WHICH DECISIONS ,abi REQUIRED15.        The questions on which decisions are required are:-(a.) Shall we risk a severe shortage of coal in thetwelve weeks from next February -to the end ofApril with the knowledge that, if this happensfirms in largo numbers will have  to close withconsequent heavy unemployment?(b) Or shall we introduce as from 1st December ascheme which will spread reductions over alonger period, give time- to industry to planaccordingly,  thereby both minimi sing the riskof unemployment and also securing that the mostimp or tacit industries suffer the leastreduction, in fuel?(c) If the answer to (b)  is in the affirmative,shall we content ourselves with a voluntaryscheme for gas and electricity, whi1e makingno change in present arrangements as regardscoal (for which,  in view of the fact that allsupplies are- programmed, no voluntary schemeis practicable other than what can be obtainedthrough the fuel efficiency campaign)?(ci) If it is accepted that the F.B.-I.  are correct inclaiming that no voluntary scheme can secure thesupport of industry or achieve the necessaryeconomics,  is it better to adopt the schemedrawn up in agreement with the F. B.I.  and the.T.U.G.  or to do nothing and hope for the best?16.        We are bound to record our conclusion that the onlyway by which the Government can adequately ensure- againstthe risk of a serious crisis early next year is to adoptthe  scheme already proposed, making it clear, however,  inthe  statement to be made,  that the Government arc not makingany cuts on pre sent allocations but have merely decided thatallocations for future months shall be based on a balancebetween anticipated supplies and anticipated requirements,priority being given,  so far as necessary,  to thoseindustries which are of special importance to our nationaleconomy.17.       Position of Industries in the Development ^reas,There is one further matter on which a decision is needed ifthe Government is to proceed in the manner proposed, namely,shall all industries in the Development Areas be givenpreference by being placed on the 5 per cent list.      Togrant such preference to all firms in Development .areas,irrespective of the importance of their products, would mean,that in these areas we should be favouring unessentialindustries, while elsewhere in the  country we  should begiving proportionately smaller allocations to industriesmanufacturing essential products.      ti-io x*oint is, however..,raised here for decision,  since  it may be fej.c   en at-   miure

is a case on employment grounds for making someconcessions even to the less essentialindustries in the Development .vreas.      Anexception of this kind would certainly beopposed by the F.B.I. in view of their expressedhostility (on grounds of equity) even to theexceptions already embodied in the scheme.-8-
