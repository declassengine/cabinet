US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETLOCATION OF THE SPECIALISED AGENCIESMemorandum by the Minister ofStateSi tua ti onThe President of the Board of Trade in his memorandumon the location of  the International Trade Organisation      :(C(46) 413)  suggests that  there are strong argumentsagainst locating this Organisation in the United States andthat,  therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Government should urge thatthe position should be kept open so as to allow for adecision in favour of the headquarters in Europe.2.      This matter was considered by the Steering Committee onInternational Organisations and it&apos; was found that a widedivergence of views existed between Departments as to  thelocation of Specialised Agencies in general.      The Steering-Committee recommended, therefore, that the Foreign Officc ,with the assistance of the Cabinet Office, -should draw upa memorandum for submission to the Cabinet summarising in anobjective fashion the developments of this general questionand the views expressed by individual Departments representedon the Committee,      This memorandum is attached as an annexto this paper,3.      The problems raised in the present paper and in theattached annex are of some urgency since the decision as tothe site to be chosen for the permanent seat of the UnitedNations is   to be taken during the present session of theGeneral Assembly, and   the nature and  extent of  the site tobe chosen will clearly be affected by any decision as towhether or  not the site must provide for the inclusion of  theHeadquarters of Specialised Agencies.Recommenda tions4..     Whilst appreciating the arguments put forward bycertain Departments in favour of a European site for theSpecialised Agencies In which  they are particularlyinterested, I remain convinced  that as a matter of generalpolicy His Majesty&apos;s Government should continue to urgethat the Headquarters of Specialised Agencies should belocated at  the site of the United Nations.CP. (46) 4155TH NOVEMBER,   1946.CAB I NET

5,      The suggestion has been advanced that many of the ad-vantages of centralisation would be attained and the disad-vantages of decentralisation overcome if the Headquarters ofcertain Specialised. Agencies were located.at any UnitedNations European Regional Headquarters that might be set up.This should not be over-looked,  but till a decision is  takenon the location of such a European Headquarters, it would, Ifeel, be premature for His Majesty&apos;s Government to abandonthe principle of centralisation at the United Nations Head-quarters site.      His Majesty&apos;s Government should, therefore,not  take the initiative in supporting a United NationsEuropean Headquarters as the Headquarters of any particularSpecialised Agency.Argumen ts6.      The arguments for and against centralisation are set outin paragraphs 17-25 of  the annexed report.      Those againstcentralisation are developed more fully in the president ofthe Board of Trade&apos;s paper.7.      I should certainly not wish to minimise the difficultiesof centralisation.      I also realise that a full degree ofcentralisation is now impossible to attain in view of thedecisions already taken in respect of  the Bank,  the Fund,U.N.E.S.C.O.  and probably P.I.C.A.Q.      Nevertheless I amconvinced for my part that where a decision still remainsopen, we should be wise to continue to argue the case forcentralisation.      We have throughout been its chief advocatesand it is unlikely that any other power would step into thebreach if we were to desert it.     For us to modify ou- attit-ude to-day could hardly  fail to cause surprise to others andembarrassment to ourselves.      As recently as 25th Octoberthe Secretary of State for Air said in the Assembly that &quot;myGovernment remain convinced that the most important singlefactor /of welding the Specialised Agencies into a single;system of United Nations  institutions/7 is to place the Head-quarters of these bodies in the new international UnitedNations centre which we are going to build&quot;.8.      Moreover,  however  great the drawbacks to &apos; centralisation,the fact can hardly be  questioned that only by centralisingas many as possible of  the specialised agencies at,  or at anyrate near,  the U.N. Headquarters can fthe whole organisationbe expected to function effectively.      It is true that we areourselves contemplating a certain degree of decentralisationof Government Departments in this country.    But no one wouldadvocate establishing the main offices of  the Ministry ofHealth at Newcastle, the Ministry of Pood at Glasgow and theBoard of Trade at Cardiff.      Yet a similar procedure appearsto be contemplated with equanimity by those who would wishto establish some of the most important specialised agenciesin a different Continent from the maid headquarters of  theU.N.      Under such an arrangement proper co-ordination amongthe agencies, whose functions in any case tend to overlap,would be impossible,9.      if in any par-ticular case it can be maintained that thereis an exceptionally strong case for a Specialised Agency tobe located in Europe, and there is the possibility that onlyby supporting a United Nations Regional Headquarters can  thenecessary centralisation be achieved, then I would agree  thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should support, though not initiate,proposals for a European site, but should urge  that thequestion be left open till a decision on the united NationsEuropean Regional Headquarters has been taken.

10,      It has also been suggested&apos; that centralisation asbetween Specialised Agencies and the United Nations mightconceivably be accomplished by locating the Economic andSocial Council of the United Nations itself outside theUnited States, the United States interest in the workingof the United Nations being adequately covered by continuingto locate the Security Council and the Assembly in theUnited States.      I think that this  is entirely wrong.    TheGeneral Assembly has already at the first part of its FirstSession last February decided that the Headquarters of theUnited Nations should be in the United States.    It would befatal to appear to be trying to go behind this decision byattempting to divide the organs of the United Nations them-selves .     The effect on the United States,  to mention onlyone point, would be most unfortunate.      Moreover, it is mostimportant to ensure that the Work of the Economic and SocialCouncil is carried out effectively and efficiently,  and thatit is serviced by an efficient Secretariat.      A divisionbetween the organs of the United Nations would inevitablylead to a greater strain on the United Nations Secretariat andconsequently to a decrease in the Secretariat&apos;s efficiencyand an increase in their gross numbers.     Finally,  theUnited Nations must be treated as an organic whole and untilthe various organs have been function!ng eff ic iontly andeffectively for a considerable time it would be premature evento suggest that one of the principal organs should from timeto time meet away from the central headquarters.Summary of recommendations.I recommend therefore th/at:-(a) His Majesty&apos;s Government should continue tourge that the headquarters of thoseSpecialised Agencies whose site has notbeen finally determined should be locatedat, or near, the U.N. Headquarters site.(b) Only if there is an exceptionally strongcase for a Specialised Agency to belocated in Europe should His Majesty&apos;sGovernment support a European site whichshould then be at the   United NationsEuropean Regional Headquarters.H. McN.Foreign Office, S.W.1.5th November;, 1946.

ANNEXLGGATION OF THE SPECIALISED AGENCIESPANT^I1.      In the Report of the Preparatory Commission, of theUnited Nations (Chapter III,  the Economic and SocialCouncil:    Section 5,  Observations on Relationships withSpecialised Agencies:    paragraph h.2,  Location ofHe ad qua r t e r s) crop e ar s the f oil ow i ng :&quot;The Economic and Social Council in itsnegotiations with the Specialised Agencies,  shouldmake the location of the headquarters of theseagencies a point of major importance with a viewto securing the advantages which flow fromcentralisation.      However,  the undoubted advantagesfollowing from centralisation must be weighed againstthe factors which,  in certain instances, may operatein favour of locating the Headquarters of an Agencyin a place which is particularly suited to thedischarge of its functions.      The possibility ofmaking exceptions to the general principle ofcentralisation has been recognised&quot;.2.      While the Preparatory Commission,  therefore,  took   .full note of the importance of centralising whereverpossible,  it recognised that it might well be necessaryto depart from this principle in certain instances forpr a c t i ca1 re a s ons.3.      Broadley speaking,  in the discussions which havehitherto taken, place on this matter within the frameworkof the Economic and Social Council in connect ion with thedrawing up of &quot;relationship agreements&quot; between theUnited Nations  (as represented by the Economic and SocialCouncil) and the Specialised Agencies, His Majesty1sGovernment have been the principal protagonists ofcentralising the location of Specialised Agencies at thesite of the United Nations.4.      In practice,  however, while in the case of such&quot;relationship agreements&quot; as have been, negotiated sofar the desirability of centralisaticn has been recognisedin principle,  the question of the location ef individualSpecialised Agencies has been. left open to a greater orlesser degree and in some instances the question has alreabeen to some extent settled outside the framework of the&quot;relationship agreements&quot;.      Further,  some SpecialisedAgencies, with whom it has not yet been possible tonegotiate &quot;relationship agreements&quot;,  have already takena definite line so far as they are concerned.      Theposition is summarised, with comment as necessary,  inPart II below in. respect of those Specialised Agencieswith which &quot;relationship agreements&quot; have already beenconcluded and in Part III in respect of those with which&quot;relationship agreements&quot; have not yet been concluded.-a-

PART II5-      The International Labour OrganisationArticle X of the Agreement negotiated with thisbody runs as follows1 &quot;Headquarters and Ronioaal Officos1.      The International Labour Organisation.,having regard to the desirability of theHeadquarters of Specialised Agencies beingsituated at the permanent saat of the UnitedNations and to. the advantages that flow fromsuch centralisation agrees to consult theUnited Nations before making any decisionconcerning the location of its permanentHeadquarters.2.      Any regional or branch offices which theInternational Labour Organisation may establishshall,,   so far as practicable be closely associatedwith such regional or branch offices as theUnited Nations may establish&quot;.6.      No decision has,  therefore, been taken about thepermanent site of the International Labour Office which,since the war,  has had its headquarters in Montreal.7.      The United Nations Educational and ScientificOr/rtnlsatioriThis boa;&apos; has already established its permanentHeadquarters in Paris and the &quot;relationship agreement&quot;concluded with the United Nations docs not,  therefore,contain any provision regarding the Headquarters of thisbody,  with the exception that Article XII has a. provisionabout regional or branch effices on the same lines asthose included In the agreement between the United Nationsand the International Labour Office.8.      The Pood and Agriculture OrganisationArticle X of the  &quot;relationship agreement&quot; between theUnited Nations and the Food and Agriculture Organisationruns as follows:-&quot;1.    The permanent Headquarters of the Poodand Agriculture Organisation of theUnited Nations shall be situated at-the permanent  seat of the UnitedNat i ens sub j e c t to;&apos; -    (a)    the Permanent Headquarters ofthe United Nations beingsituated at a place where thePood and Agriculture Organisationof the United Nations caneffectively ana economicallydischarge its duties and maintaineffective liaison with those .Specialised Agencies with whichit is particularly concernedjm

(b)    satisfactory arrangements being madein a subsequent agreement betweenthe Food and Agriculture.Organisationof the United Nations and the UnitedNations regarding the provision ofa site and necessary facilities forthe establishment of such Headquarters.The United Nations shall provide the Food andAgriculture Organisations of the United Nations withappropriate assistance in the establishment of thepermanent Headquarters of the Organisation at thepermanent scat of the United Nations&quot;.9.      There is a provision also about regional and branchoffices on the same lines as those cited above inconnection with the International Labour Organisationand the United Nations Educational;,  Scientific andCultural Organisation.10.    It is apparent that the Food and AgricultureOrganisation have stipulated for considerable reservationsregarding their location at the permanent seat of theUnited Nations.      In fact at the recent CopenhagenConference,  there was widespread support for a European,site for the Organisation which is strongly supported bythe Ministers of Food and Agriculture and the Director-General was directed to re-examine the question andsubmit a report.      The President of the Board of Tradealso supports the above Ministers&apos; views and in connectionwith the quotation from 1 (a)  of Article X of the&quot;relationship agreement&quot; cited in paragraph 10 is anxious. that the Food and Agriculture Organisation shall have acommon site with that of the International TradeOr gen I s a t i on.11.    Provisional International Civil Aviation OrganisationArticle XI of the &quot;relationship agreement&quot; betweenthe International Civil Aviation Organisation and theUnited Nations runs as follows:-&quot;The International Civil Aviation Organisation,having regard to the desirability of theHeadquarters of Specialised Agencies beingsituated at the permanent seat of the UnitedNations and to the advantages that flow fromsuch centralisation,  agrees to consult theUnited Nations before making any furtherdecision concerning the location of itspermanent Headquarters.Having regard to the special needs ofInternational Civil Aviation,  any regional orbranch offices which the International CivilAviation authorities may establish shall,  sofar as practicable, be closely associatedwith such regional or branch offices as theUnited Nations may establish&quot;.

12.    The above wording makes it clear that the ProvisionalInternational Civil Aviation Authority has already takena firm decision about its Headquarters and as to thenecessity for consulting its own requirements and purposesbefore agreeing to centralisation, at the scat of theUnited Nations.      The Organisation is in fact situatedat Montreal and is strongly averse from moving to theUnited States on the ground that it would run the riskof falling under the control of United States CivilAviation interests.      The Ministry of Civil Aviation hasstrongly urged that Montreal be retained as the site andhas been supported by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.PART III13*    The International Reconstruction Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund.It has already been provided that these twoOrganisations are to be located in Washington.      This wason the insistent demand of the United States representativesand against the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Though it has not yet been possible to negotiate a&quot;relationship agreement&quot; with either of these bodies,there is very little chance of being able to reverse thedecision already taken as to the -permanent Headquarters oft he s e Or g an i s a t i on s.1U.    The International Trade OrganisationAs indicated above,   the. President of the Board ofTrade has recommended that there should be no commitmentat present to the location of this Organisation at theHeadquarters of the United Nations or to its locationanywhere in the United States.      The President iscirculating to the Cabinet a separate paper on thissubject in which lie stresses the arguments in favour ofa location in Europe,      The United Kingdom representativeson the International Monetary Fund and the InternationalBank have expressed their strong agreement with these views.15.    The International Telecommunications Union and thoUna, versa!&quot; Post a T&quot; Tjh ion &quot;      &quot;&quot; &apos;&quot;&quot;Both these bodies are at present administered underthe auspices of the Swiss Government and there is likelyto be strong pressure for locating their Headquarters,in any &quot;relationship agreement&quot; in Europe.      The&apos; PostmasterGeneral is understood to favour this view.16.    The World Health OrganisationThis Organisation is not yet established and &quot;itsdraft Constitution,provides for consultation with theUnited Nations before any decision is taken as to a permanentlocation.      There was considerable support for a European,site during the June Health Conference,   though the UnitedKingdom delegation has succeeded in keeping the question open.

The pressure in favour of a European site will probably hecontinued at the Interim Commission meetins on JLi.th November,at Geneva,      The Ministry of Health point out that beforeany final decision is taken, an important point Is where theheadquarters of the Pood and Agriculture Organisation andProvisional International Civil Aviation Organisation arelocated,  since it is with these Specialised Agencies inparticular &quot;that the World Health Organisation will berequired to work.      The Ministry of Health feel that asite in America at the United Nations Headquarters wouldentail American influence and methods playing too greata part in the World Health Organisation1s work.Furthermore, whilst  a   European site would almost certainlynot sacrifice American, support,  on. the other hand a sitein America at the United Nations headquarters might welllead to a decrease in the support of the World HealthOrganisation!s work by non-American countries.PANT IV17.    Arguments have been adduced both for and againstcentralisation of sites of Specialised Agencies,  at theUnited Nations Headquarters.      They may be briefly summarisedas follows.18.    The main.argument in favour of centralisation isthat His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s declared policy is totreat the United Nations as a step towards the ultimateobjective of world government.      It would clearly be aretrograde step,  as a matter of principle,  to propose &apos;that the headquarters of Specialised Agencies, which areto carry out much of the field work on behalf of theUnited Nations,  should be located away from the -parentbody.      For this reason, the British delegate has,whenever the question has arisen,  always argued infavour of centralisation.19.    Apart from this main policy consideration,  one ofthe chief difficulties that is daily more- apparent isthat of co-ordinating the activities of the United Nationswith the Specailiscd Agencies.      In many fields there is aconsiderable functional overlapping, and centralisation efthe headquarters of these organisations at the UnitedNations headquarters, by facilitating close personal contact,would undoubtedly be one of the main factors to preventthis overlapping, which may greatly handicap their work.20.    In addition it may well he possible to simplify manyadministrative arrangements if the headquarters are locatedat United Nations headquarters.21.    It has been argued that the above can be achievedby locating the headquarters ef all the Specialised Agencieselsewhere than at the United Nations seat.      But against thisit can be contended that a single seat for the headquartersof the Specialised Agencies and of the United Nations wouldprovide the best focusing point and the best means ofco-ordination not only&quot;between the Specialised Agenciesthemselves,  but Between them and the United Nations.

22,      On. the ether hand, when the case of each individualSpecialised Agency is taken into account,  there are particulartechnical consid.erations which make it desirable that theorganisation in question should be located in Europe rather thanj in America,      This argument has been cited in the case of thePood and Agriculure Organisation,  the World Health Organisation,the International Telecommunications Union and the Universalpostal Union,      In the case of the first two bodies it is feltI the work they are to undertake would be -facilitated by aEuropean site where the problems with which they have to dealare more acute and nearer at hand.      In the case cf other bodiessuch as the International Telecommunications Union,  the UniversalPostal Union, and,  as already mentioned,  the World HealthOrganisation and the Provisional International Civil aviationOrganisation, a site at United Nations Headquarters or in theUnited States at all would have the great disadvantage thatAmerican influence in the organisations in question wouldundoubtedly become very great and. might well impede the efficientworking of the organisation by ohanelling it in accordance withpurely American conceptions.     Moreover,  to locate a SpecialisedAgency at the United Natisns Headquarters might result in theorganisation being staffed with a predominant proportion ofAmerican personnel.     The same argument has been used in favourof locating the International Trade Organisation outside theUnited States,23,      It is also argued that by locating headquarters indifferent countries the interest of those  countries in the workof the Specialised Agencies in question and of the United Nationsgenerally, will be stimulated.      This is claimed as a strongargument for de-centralisat ion,  since the building up of worldgovernment can be better achieved by the efficient working ofthe various Specialised agencies, which must be based on awide international interest in their work.24.      There is also the  important  argument  that  the financial,bur-den placed on Specialised Agencies would be greatly Increasedby the excessively high costs&apos;of a United Nations Headquarters.This might lead to an excessive influence  of the Great Powersby increasing their financial control, since the smaller powersmight well bo unable to meet, their allotted percentage if thetotal financial burden were substantially increased.      Furthermore,administrative costs might become so high as to prejudicethe actual operations of the Agencies,25.      The strain on personnel requirements must be an importantconsideration, but it is not easy to determine whether thiswould be eased or- increased by centralisation.      It has beenargued that the necessity to travel to America for frequentconferences of the Specialised Agencies places great strain onthe personnel of Government Departments,      On the other hand,by locating the Specialised Agencies at or near the united NationsHeadquarters it might prove possible to economise on personnelby making use cf the permanent delegation at United NationsHeadquarters.    Certain of the Dominions have already observedthat&quot;if the Headquarters of the Specialised agencies werecentralised at the United Nations Headquarters, it would assistthem to meet  the present strain on their personnel, since onerepresentative could then cover  several meetings at one and the&quot;same time.      The upshot stems  tc bo that by centralising theSpecialised Agencies at the United Nations Headquarters it wouldbe possible tc. economise en man-power but this would besomewhat  offset by the additional time spoilt  en travel.

PART V26,    For the sake of completeness it should &quot;be mentionthat the suggestion has &quot;been advanced that ccntralisatas between Specialised Agencies and the United Nationsmight conceivably be accomplished by locating theEconomic and Social Council outside the United States,United States interest in the&apos;working of the UnitedNations being adequately covered by continuing tolocate the Security Council and the Asseinbly in- theUnited States.27.    It has also been suggested that the arguments inPart IV have not taken into account a possible viamedia.      Where it is not found possible or desirableto locate the headquarters of particular SpecialisedAgencies at the United Nations headquarters site, manyof the advantages of centralisation would be attainedif the headquarters of these Agencies wore located atany United Nations European regional headquarters thatmight be set up.      This course would also enable someof the disadvantages of the United Nations headquarterto be met,  such as that of undue American influence anexcessive costs.-10-
