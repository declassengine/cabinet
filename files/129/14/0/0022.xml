(46) 422lith November, 1946CABINETSOCIALISATION OF THE RUHR INDUSTRIESMemorandum by Minister of StateRecommendations :CUSTODY of the coal, iron and steel, heavy engineering and chemicalindustries situated in the Land North Rhine-Westphalia should immediately betransferred by the British Zone Commander to German Custodians.2. An announcement should at the same time be made that this is the firststep iif the process of socialisation and that the second step will consist of thetransfer of ownership to German public bodies.3. Immediate study should be undertaken of the means of setting up thesecorporations and safeguarding United Nations and non-German interests in thetransferred undertakings.4. A ruling should be given on the question whether the corporations shouldbe in the first instance responsible to the Land Government or to a Central GermanGovernment (and pending the establishment of a Central Government to theZonal Advisory Council).5. Observers from the United States of America, France, Belgium, Hollandand Luxembourg, should be attached to the British Zone Commander in connexionwith his control over the Ruhr industries.MemorandumI attach at Annex A the paper by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairson the Ruhr (CP. (46) 398), which was discussed at the Cabinet meeting on29th October. As a result of the discussion at the Cabinet meeting variouspoints were raised which call for a more detailed account of how it was pro-posed that the scheme set out in CP. (46) 398 would work. I have set out inthis memorandum a broad outline of this scheme, with special reference to thepoints raised at the discussion at the Cabinet on 29th October.These points were (a) whether the transfer of the industries would havefull legal force, (&amp;) whether the proposed corporation should be under thecentral German Government or the Land Government, and (c) whether it wasnecessary to have observers from the Western Powers appointed by the BritishCommander-in-Chief.(a) Legal Questions2. In putting forward this outline, I must emphasise that it is neitherPossible nor desirable to go into too much detail at present, particularly as regardsthe exact legal and administrative arrangements which will have to be made forthe transfer of the industries, and the setting up of the corporations. Theexact form which these legal and administrative arrangements will take requirescareful consideration and discussion between the Departments of His Majesty&apos;sgovernment concerned and the British authorities in Germany; and there is nodoubt that advice will have to be sought from the German authorities in theBritish zone. The source of legal authority will for some time to come continue^be the British Commander-in-Chief in the zone, and he will have ample powers10 put into effect such legal and administrative arrangements as are necessary.13682   [32701] b
In doing this, however, he will have to take full account of the relevant provisionsof public and private German law, of the rights whether as sharenoiders oras mortgagees, &amp;c, of Germans on the one hand and of non-Germans on theother hand in the industries in question, and of the legal and administrativearrangements which will from time to time exist between the British authoritiesin the zone and the local Land Government and its subordinate authorities.I am most anxious therefore that the authority of the British Commander-in-Chief should not at this stage be unduly hampered by too close a definitionor restriction of the powers which will be available to him, or of the mannerin which he should exercise those powers. Detailed schemes can and will beworked out from time to time to give effect to the general policy set out inCP. (46) 398, if this is approved, close consultation will be maintained throughoutwith the competent Departments in London. Questions of importance will bereferred to Ministers in the normal way.3. Subject to what is stated above, I contemplate that the scheme set outin CP. (46) 398 for dealing with the Ruhr industries will be carried out inthree stages, which may be sub-divided in the light of experience and of thecourse of events.  These three stages are : (A) From now until after a new Land Government has been elected nextspring in the Land North Rhine-Westphalia, when suitable corpora-tions can be established. (There is at present a nominated LandGovernment, which is not, however, representative of the strengthof the political parties.)(B) From the establishment of suitable corporations until the end of theperiod of general occupation of Germany (or the end of the Britishoccupation of the Ruhr area1 -whichever is the later).(C) From the end of period (B) for so long as there is international controlof the Ruhr area.4. Stage A. The best course for political reasons would be to transferimmediately the ownership of the major industries in the Ruhr to Germantrustees on behalf of the German people pending the preparation of a detailedplan for the vesting of these industries in German public bodies. This proposalmeets with serious difficulties, however, in regard to foreign shareholdings whichmay exist in some of these industries, and also in the fact that the conceptionof trusteeship is not readily understood by the Germans. One possibility wouldbe to try to divide the assets of these industries into those which are purelyGerman-owned and those in which there is a United Nations or other non-German interest and to transfer ownership of the former but not of the latter.This would, however, involve considerable delay and might often be a verycomplicated process. It seems better, therefore, to take the alternative course,which can be adopted immediately, namely, to transfer the custody, which is atpresent held by the Commander-in-Chief, of all the industrial assets, to Germancustodians. This avoids for the time being the question of transferring legaltitle, since a trustee is by definition the holder of this title, and a custodian isnot. The transfer of custody would, therefore, not affect existing rights andliabilities in the undertakings (e.g., mortgages and shareholdings).5. The custodians would be recommended by the Land Government or theZonal Advisory Council and appointed by the British Zone Commander, who hasample power to transfer custody in this manner under Military Governmentordinances which have full legal force. The powers of the custodians would, inpractice, be limited and would not in any way interfere with the existing powersof control and direction exercised generally by the British Zone Commander andin particular by the North German Coal Control. The main purpose of theappointment of custodians would be to show that the industries were no longerexclusively under British custody, while not being returned to their originalGerman owners. The exact terms and conditions of the transfer of custody wouldrequire careful consideration from the legal and security points of view and wouldbe embodied in appropriate legal instruments. As stated above the rights ofmortgagees, shareholders and other interested parties would not be affected.The enforcement of remedies arising out of all such rights would be for the timebeing barred in the German courts.6. The transfer of custody would cover the physical assets of the coal, ironand steel, heavy engineering, and chemical industries within the North Rhine-Westphalia Land. No exhaustive catalogue of these assets would be necessaryat this stage, but would have to be prepared for Stage B.
7. At the same time as this stage was taken an announcement would befflade that it was a first step in the process of transfer to German public owner-ghip, that the second step in the process would consist of the actual transfer ofownership to German public bodies, that consultation would be held with appro-priate German authorities before deciding on the exact conditions and methodsof transfer and that appropriate arrangements would be made with regard tothe rights and interests of non-Germans.8. As soon as this transfer of custody has been made we should beginconsultations between interested departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government todecide the measures necessary to define and safeguard United Nations and othernon-German interests in the properties to be transferred and the steps whichwould be necessary to take in German law to provide these safeguards and topreserve the appropriate legal remedies.9. Stage B. It is contemplated that this will begin at some date afterelections have,been held next spring in the Land North Rhine-Westphalia andafter consultations have taken place between the elected Land Government, thecustodians and the Commander-in-Chief. German corporations will then beestablished under the authority of (a) legislation by the Land Government onmatters on which it is empowered to legislate; (b) ordinances by the Commander-jn-Chief on matters reserved for the eventual authority of the Central Govern-ment but at present remaining within ihis authority. The constitutional powersand obligations of the corporations will have to be fully considered and includedin carefully drafted charters and other documents containing precise definitionsof the assets transferred, the powers to be given to the corporations and themanner in which they shall be exercised. The claims of German shareholderscan be left to be dealt with by the Land Government but it will at this stagebe necessary to define and announce exactly what are the interests of UnitedNations and other non-German owners, and how these rights and interests areto be safeguarded and indemnified. The rights of transferred undertakings andtheir liabilities, including those towards non-German owners so defined, willtlhen be vested in the corporations. It may be necessary, however, to take stepsto ensure that the corporations cannot be sued without any restrictions in theGerman courts in pursuance of these rights, at any rate for the time being.10. The corporations will by their charters only be able to operate subjectto (a) a general security control designed to prevent the manufacture of arms, &amp;c,and (&amp;) such general and special directives as the Commander-in-Chief mayissue as regards the nature and extent of the production and manufacture tobe undertaken by the industries; (c) an express prohibition from handing overany of their property or powers to otlher persons or bodies whether public orprivate without the express sanctions f the Commander-in-Chief.-(b) Responsibility to Land or Central Government11. Further consideration has been given to the question raised in theCabinet on 29th October whether the corporations should be responsible to thei Land Government or to the Central Government. It has not been possible toj reach agreement between the Foreign Office and the Control Office on this point.The arguments in favour of the Land Government are (i) one of the considerationsin setting up the Land North Rhine-Westphalia was that it should have controlover these corporations; (ii) the Land Government will be far more easilycontrolled by the British Commander-in-Chief in the first instance andlater by an international body than the Central Government; (iii) there is atpresent no Central Government and it is impossible to say when one will beestablished; (iv) the temporary use of the Zonal Advisory Council in the placelater to be occupied by the Central Government would be most inappropriate.This Council is by definition advisory and neither elective nor executive and it18 not fitted for these important executive functions. Moreover, the zone is anartificial and temporary division to which we do not wish to give a vested1 interestin survival. It would also be difficult to restrict these powers to the AdvisoryCouncil of the British zone only in view of the economic fusion with theAmerican zone; (v) a Central Government with control over the Ruhr whichjeU under Russian domination would be a most serious threat to our security;(yi) the French and smaller Western Powers would be strongly against makingthe corporations responsible to the Central Government as opposed to the Landgovernment; (vii) finally, if we are not to have confidence in the Land Govern-&quot;tents and are not to give them a real measure of authority and responsibility,[32701] &quot; b 2
we would have to give up our whole conception of the decentralisation ofGermany. If it is said that we cannot give these powers to the Land Governmentbecause it is politically untrustworthy, there is certainly no more and probablyeven less guarantee that a Central Government will be any more trustworthy?If the Land Government proves unsatisfactory it would be easy to restore completecontrol to the British zone Commander or to an international body. If theCentral Government proved untrustworthy this would create a situation of fargreater difficulty and danger; (viii) the Foreign Secretary has been consultedon this point and confirms that he is strongly in favour of making the Corpora-tions responsible to the Land Government. He could not agree to vesting themin the zonal authority, or to committing himself in any way now to placing themunder a Central Government at a later date.12. The Control Office take a different view. They feel that these industriesare basic to the whole German economy and, even if nominally owned by the LandGovernment, would have to come under the direct control of the Central Govern-ment if the reserved powers of the Latter in the economic field were to meananything. Such big national assets should properly be owned by the wholecommunity rather than by a localised section which would be incapable of carryingthe responsibilities . A Land Government would not be in a position to meet thefinancial commitments which the ownership of these industries would involve,including compensation to dispossessed shareholders, subsidies in times of worldslump, and the provision of additional capital. This matter has been fullyconsidered by the British Element of the Control Commission in Berlin, whose firmopinion is that the coal, iron and steel industries must ultimately be treated as anational asset under a central German Government, and not left in the hands of aLand Government. The predominant political party in Land North Rhine-Westphalia is C.D.U. whereas the political party in Germany most in favour ofthe public ownership of industries, and therefore most likely to operate suchindustries along the proper lines, is the S.P.D., whose influence would be excludedif the industries were the sole concern of the North Rhine-Westphalia LandGovernment. It is also conceivable that a future Central Government mightexperience serious trouble with the Land Government in the event of the latterexploiting its privilege and economic position as sole owner of the country&apos;s keyindustries. It would certainly be difficult for the Central Government to&apos;&apos; nationalise &apos;&apos; these industries if the industries were already owned by a singleLand Government. Both the S.P.D. and the Trade Unions are known to beopposed to Land control of the industries concerned. The Control Office would,therefore, prefer to see these industries placed in the hands of a German bodycovering the Zone who would be in the position of interim custodians, as it were,for a future central German Government, or, should the eventuality arise, aZonal or Western German Government. Thus, all political parties would shareresponsibility for these industries. Whilst, at first sight, it would not appearthat the same security objectives would be achieved if the Corporations wereeventually to be transferred to a central German Government, on analysis thisjis not, in fact, the case. It is clear that, in a decentralised German politicalsystem, powers somewhat on the following lines will have to be reserved to theCentral Government: (1) The direction of certain basic industries and distribution of materials Iin critical short supply.(2) The establishment of fundamental principles in regard to : (a) Development and ownership of industries.(b) Registration, placing and recruitment of labour.With such powers, it is true that a hostile Central German Government couldjjseek to hamper the attainment of the objectives of international control if they&quot;&quot;wished, but this would be the case whether they or a Land Government of NorthRhine-Westphalia held the title to the Corporations. In such an eventuality,it would be open to the Allied Occupation Powers to take over the administra-tion of the Land, and this could be done equally effectively whether the industrieswere legally owned by the Land or by the Central Government. Finally, theControl Office feel that there is considerable advantage providing now for vestingthe ownership of the Corporations in the Authority with whom we shall maka Peace Treaty, i.e., the Central Government, since the latter will be responsiblto the Allies for the carrying out of the terms of Peace. In the interim period,whilst it is true the Zonal Advisory Council is not an elected body, the same istrue of the present North Rhine-Westphalia Land Government, and there is nq
reason why, when the Land Elections have taken place next March, the threeLander Governments should not be equally competent to set up between themBoards for the nationalised industries, satisfactory to and representative of allthree Governments, and contributing to the general economy of the Zone.13. Stage C. This will begin as soon as the general occupation of Germanyceases and an international control for the Ruhr area has been set up, but if theformer event were to happen without the latter having been effected, Stage Bwould continue for so long as there was a British Commander-in-Chief in theRuhr area. It is not possible or desirable at this stage to set out in any detailthe provisions which will be necessary to govern the Ruhr industries during thisperiod. In general, however, I contemplate that the arrangements already inexistence under Stage B will continue under Stage C with the necessary modifica-tions in favour of an international as opposed to a purely British control, but itmay well be possible to relax the powers of the International Controllingauthority (whatever form this may take) as regards the production and manufac-ture undertaken by the industries, but not, of course, as regards the manufactureand production of arms, or generally on security questions. In earlier papersabout the Ruhr there has been discussion about the problems to which anInternational Controlling authority would give rise, but this matter need notbe considered at the present time and will come^befoTe the Ministers, probablyon several occasions, before such an authority is(over-established.(c) Observers14. Objection was taken at the Cabinet on 29th October to the proposal thatthe British Commander-in-Chief should be assisted in his control of theCorporations by Observers from the United States, France, Belgium, Hollandand Luxembourg. I have ascertained from the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs that in spite of the arguments used against this proposal he feels boundto maintain it strongly on the following grounds : (i) The proposal was included in his earlier paper CP. (46) 139 of15th April, and no objection was raised by the Cabinet. The Secretaryof State was authorised to discuss his general proposals with the otherinterested Governments, including particularly France, Belgium andHolland, and on this authority the proposal with regard to foreignobservers was specifically mentioned to the French and United StatesGovernments. It would be most difficult to draw back from this now.(ii) After the economic fusion of the British and United States Zones, andat a time when we are asking the United States Government to bearthe major share of the financial burden, it is essential that we shouldoffer the Americans facilities for observing what is done with the mostimportant economic asset of the two zones.(iii) France, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg have a very special interestin the Ruhr, and it is our policy to build the strongest links betweenWestern Germany and- the Western European economic system. Itwould be unrealistic to give Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg specialfacilities for participating in the control of German industry as awhole. This would only invite Russia to bring in Poland andCzechoslovakia as well.(iv) Russia should not be admitted to the Ruhr except in return for compar-able concessions elsewhere,(v) Russian participation would give rise to all kinds of industrial andpolitical trouble.(vi) Russia has no claim to participate until she treats Germany as aneconomic whole.15. It does not seem necessary to seek quadripartite consent to the measuresproposed for stages A and B. Quadripartite consent will clearly be necessaryfor setting up the international control envisaged in stage C16.   The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster agrees with this paper.13th November, 1946.H. McN.
INTERNATIONAL  CONTROL  OF  THE  RUHRMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsRecommendations.1. The principal industries in the area North Rhine-Westphalia shouldnot be transferred to Allied ownership but should be socialised.2. Trustees of German nationality should be appointed by the Land Govern-ment of North Rhine-Westphalia to take title of ownership of the propertiesconcerned under a provisional charter and hold such titles in trust^ for Germanpublic corporations. The latter would be established in consultation with theTrustees as soon as the Land Government has been elected.3. The control should be exercised by the British Zone Commander untilthe general occupation of Germany is terminated. Representatives from theUnited States, France, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg, but not Russia, wouldbe associated with him as observers.4. The form of the international control, and particularly the question ofRussian participation after the period of the general occupation of Germany isover, will require further consideration later. We must not commit ourselves onthis point meanwhile.Memorandum1. On the 17th April, 1946, the Cabinet considered a paper on the Futureof Germany and the Ruhr, which was circulated as CP. (46) 156, and a furtherpaper CP. (46) 139 on the Ruhr and Western Germany. These papers containedtwo alternative plans for the international control of the principal industriesof the Ruhr. One proposal, known as the E.I.P.S. Plan, provided for economiccontrol being exercised through ownership or j3art ownership of a selected groupof industrial companies. Ownership would be transferred to an InternationalHolding Corporation, voting control of which would be retained by the partici-pating Powers. The profits earned would be made available to the Germanpeople either through the new local authority covering the area or to theprovincial Government, or, if desired, to a central German Government. Thepowers of the Corporation would be defined in a charter from the GermanGovernment which would be the subject of agreement with the participatingPowers. The Corporation would possess no additional powers such as the rightto veto other legislation or compelling the German Government to pass newlaws. Any breach of the Charter would constitute a breach between the GermanGovernment and the participating Powers entitling the latter to impose sanctions.The Corporation would be directed by a Council of representatives ofeach participating Power, who would report direct to their Govern-ments and would have votes equivalent to the shareholding of theirGovernment. Ordinary decisions of the Corporation would be takenby&apos; a 51 per cent. vote. In cases where the question of the impositionof sanctions arose a 75 per cent, vote of the Council would constituteautomatic authority for the Commander-in-Chief of the occupying forces inthe area to take the necessary action. Provision would be made for the GermanGovernment to appeal to U.N.O., and to make the plan palatable to the Germansit was proposed that the control should be terminated at the end of a statedperiod of say 50 years, subject to the approval of the Security Council.2. The second proposal was on somewhat different lines. Instead of theindustries being owned internationally they would be made into a socialisedGerman Corporation, which would be set up by the Provincial Government ofthe area and whose relationship to that Government would be the same as thatof the National Coal Board in this country to His Majesty&apos;s Government.Germany&apos;s obligation in regard to the transferred industries would be laid downCP.

in such detail as necessary in the peace treaties, and an International ControlOrganisation would be formed to supervise the performance of these obligations.Thus political control, with, of course, the possibility of political and militarysanction, would be substituted for industrial control through ownership. ,3. When these two alternative proposals were considered by the Cabinet0n the 17th April opinion was divided as to which of the two plans was thepreferable. I was authorised, however, to discuss them both with the countriesprincipally concerned, and also to seek their approval for the establishment ofa new Province in this area.4. Since then both plans have been shown to the United States, French,Belgian and Dutch Governments, whose views may be summarised as follows : United States Government.5. We have received no official intimation of the United States Govern-menfs views on our plans for internationalisation of the Ruhr. Discussions withrepresentatives of the State Department in Paris last April suggested, however,that of the two plans they favoured socialisation rather than ownership of theindustries concerned. More recently Mr. Byrnes in his Stuttgart speech hassuggested that the United States favour a general control of industry in Germany.This accords with his proposal for a Four-Power Treaty to guarantee thedemilitarisation of Germany. This is not irreconcilable with our own plans fora special and localised control in the Ruhr. Mr. Byrnes also announced in hisspeech that the United States were opposed to political separation of the Ruhr.French Government.6. Discussions in April with the French showed that they were not at thatstage prepared to abandon their proposals for the political separation of theRuhr from the rest of Germany. Given political separation they felt that itwould be better to socialise the industries concerned rather than transfer themto international ownership, with the exception of coal. In the case of coalthey pointed out the vital importance to the French economy of continuing coalexports from the Ruhr, and felt that the only way to achieve this was by theinternational ownership and management of the mines.Belgian and Dutch Governments.7. Both of these Governments are opposed to political separation and favoursocialisation rather than international ownership.8. All of the above countries were in favour of the establishment of a newProvince whose boundaries would include the important industries of the Ruhrvalley and the surrounding neighbourhood and accordingly in 1946 a new LandNorth Rhine-Westphalia was established by the British Commander-in-Chief.9. The question of international control of the Ruhr is bound to arise inthe course of the forthcoming discussions of the Council of Foreign Ministers onthe fusion of Germany, and I feel that by then we should be prepared to come outwith definite proposals of our own.10. The points on which a decision must therefore be reached are asfollows(1) Whether the industries of the Ruhr should be transferred to internationalownership or socialised.(2) If socialised, should the Corporation formed to acquire the properties ofthe industries concerned be set up by the Government of the LandNorth Rhine-Westphalia or by a Central German Government.(3) When the international control should be established and which Powersshould participate.11.   My own views on these questions are as follows: International Ownership or Socialisation.12. I have come to the conclusion that we should abandon our first planfor international ownership and come firmly out with a proposal for socialisa-tion. We have always recognised that under international ownership it would bePolitically undesirable and financially impracticable for Germany to be forcedto remit the earnings of the industries in foreign exchange to foreign owners, andrtwas for this reason that under the plan for international ownership provision
was made for the retention of the profits by Germany. Ownership deprived ofthe right to receive profits is an unreal conception. It would involve us in allthe responsibility for determining the policy on which the industries must beoperated without any of the advantages. It would also inevitably extend thepurposes which we have in mind for the establishment of international controlso as to include commercial as well as security considerations. It is mostimprobable that the commercial interests of the participating Powers can remainidentical for long and once differences of opinion arose between them on com-mercial grounds Germany would be quick to take advantage of this and byplaying one off against the other would inevitably weaken our security hold.Socialisation of the basic industries is strongly supported by the majority ofGermans, particularly by the S.P.D. International ownership would be stronglyresented by all Germans.Should the Government of Land North Rhine-Westphalia or an eventual CentralGerman Government be responsible for setting up the Socialised Corpora-tion to which the Ruhr industries concerned would be transferred ?13. This question has recently been under consideration by the BritishElement of the Control Commission. They advocate that in the case of coal,iron and steel, there is a strong case for their assets being transferred to Corpora-tions which would be established by a Central German Government. Theseindustries are basic to German economic life as a whole and the branches of themwhich exist in other zones should also, in their opinion, be brought into publicownership. Moreover, they contend that the financial complications involvednot only in compensating owners for property acquired but also in financingdeficits in times of depression and finding new money for investment, wouldprove beyond the capacity of the Land Government. These arguments deserveconsideration. On the other hand, there is no Central Government for the timebeing and in the state of our present relations with Russia it is impossible to saywhen, if at all, a Government with jurisdicton over the whole of the fouroccupied zones will be established. A Central Government with control over theRuhr, which fell under Russian domination, would be a most serious threat toour security. Moreover, the establishment of the Corporations by a CentralGovernment must obviously be less conducive to security than their establishmentby the Government of the Land under permanent military occupation which couldbe temporarily excluded from the jurisdiction of German Government andoperated by the Allies in the event of any major breach of the treaty occurringThe French, who favour the maximum degree of decentralisation, would certainlytake this view, and I myself am not prepared to accept the recommendation ofthe British Element, at any rate at this stage.14. The solution to this problem which I recommend is that we should notat this stage create public Corporations for the coal, iron and steel industries,but vest the properties concerned in the hands of trustees of German nationalityappointed by the Land Government of North Rhine-Westphalia, under a provis-ional charter and obliged to hold such titles in trust for the future Germanpublic Corporations and on behalf of the German people. After the election ofa Land Government in the spring, it would consult with the Trustees and Britishauthorities with a view to setting up Corporations as soon as possible. Thiswould put an end to the uncertainty which at present exists as to whether theseproperties should be regarded, as German or foreign owned. If at a later datethe Land Government proved incapable of discharging its responsibilities, furtherconsideration could be given to the alternative of transfer to a Central Govern-ment and to the possibility of devising adequate safeguards.The Date of Establishment of an International Control and its Composition.15. So long as the occupation of the whole of Germany continues, controlover the Ruhr industries should be exercised by the British Zone Commander.Representatives from the United States, France, Holland, Belgium and Luxem-bourg could be associated with him as observers. As regards Russia I am notprepared to admit any participation in the Ruhr except in return for somecomparable concession.E. B.Foreign Office, 24th October, 1946.
