THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1946.SECRET Copy No.CP. (46) 407.31st October, 1946.CABINET.REDISTRIBUTION OF SEATS.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.THE provisional recommendations of the Boundary Commissions which haverecently been published in local newspapers have been widely criticised on theground that insufficient regard has been paid to the unity of communities. Inorder to obtain the correct mathematical result it is proposed in many cases thatportions of boroughs and counties shall be detached and added to adjoiningareas with the result that many people would find themselves for parliamentarypurposes cut away from the town or county to which they are bound by presentadministrative arrangements and by historic ties and assigned to districts towhich they feel they do not belong.2. The Boundary Commissions, in framing their regulations, arfe bound bythe rules in the Third Schedule to the House of Commons (Redistribution of seats) Act, 1944. Rule 4 requires that so far as is practicable having regardto Rule 1, the electorate of any constituency returning a single member shallnot be greater or less than the electoral quota by more than approximately one-quarter of the electoral quota. The electoral quota is obtained by dividing thetotal electorate of Great Britain by the number of constituencies and is now about 56,000. Rule 1, to which Rule 4 refers, requires that the number of con-stituencies for Great Britain shall not be substantially greater or less than 591,and that the number of constituencies for Scotland shall not be less than 71 andfor Wales not less than 35. The Commissions, therefore, can only depart fromRule 4 if that is necessary to give Scotland or Wales the required number of constituencies; otherwise they are bound by the requirement that no constituencyshall be greater or less than the electoral quota by more than approximately one-quarter. Rule 5, which contains provisions for preserving the unity oflocal government areas &quot; so far as is practicable having regard to the foregoingrules,&quot; is subordinate to Rule 4, which prescribes the limits of variation fromthe quota. If, therefore, the electorate of a borough is too small to justify theallocation of one member under Rule 4, it is necessary to combine the boroughwith an adjoining district, while if the electorate of a borough is too large fora single member but too small for two members, part of the borough has to bedetached and joined on to an adjoining district.3. The rules in the Third Schedule to the Act of 1944 give exact effectto the recommendations of the Speaker&apos;s Conference; but, no doubt at the timewhen these recommendations were made, it was not realised to what extent theywould have the effect of dismembering communities.4. The provisional recommendations of the Commissions are subject to modification as a result of the consideration of objections, but it is evident thatin many cases it will not be possible within the existing rules for the Commis-sions to modify their recommendations in such a way as to meet the main objectionof principle which has been raised. This objection is so cogent and is so stronglyfelt by many members of all parties that if a Bill were introduced to give effectto such final recommendations as the Commissions may make under the existing law, it would be unlikely to pass through the House of Commons.[32616]
5. The Home Secretary has discussed this problem informally with the speaker and Sir Roland Burrows, the Deputy Chairman of the Boundary Corn-mission for England : and found that the members of the Commission are in fullsympathy with the objection. He was assured that the Commissions have been most anxious to preserve the unity of communities, and that their proposalswhich involve the dismembering of local government areas have been made withthe greatest reluctance and only, in cases where they felt obliged to do so havingregard to the statutory requirements by which they are bound. The Commissionswould welcome a wider discretion.6. In these circumstances it is necessary to consider amending legislation,and we suggest that legislation should be introduced at an early date amendingRules 4 and 5 of the Third Schedule to the Act of 1944 so as to require the commissions, while aiming so far as is practicable at approximate mathematicalequality, to preserve the integrity of. local government areas except where theapplication of this rule would result in a disparity between an electorate andthe electoral quota so great as in the opinion of the Boundary Commissionconcerned to justify departure from its application.7. &apos; It would then be necessary also to amend Rule 3 (relating to two-member constituencies) in Order to prevent a possible conflict between its provisions andthe proposed new Rules 4 and 5; and we suggest that a rule in general terms should be substituted, requiring that every constituency shall return a singlemember unless the Boundary Commission concerned are satisfied that for special reasons it is undesirable to divide an existing two-member constituency.8. If the Cabinet approve these proposals in principle we shall be glad to have authority for confidential discussions with the Deputy Chairmen of thefour Commissions as to the precise terms of the new Rules.9. Such legislation would involve requiring the Commissions to make afresh review of the constituencies, and it is desirable that this fresh review should be based on the latest available figures of electorates. The Commissions&apos;&apos;present proposals are based on the distribution of the electorate shown in theregister published on the 15th October, 1945, and the qualifying date for thatregister was the 30tih June, 1945. Information as to the electorate on the registerpublished on the 15th October, 1946, for which the qualifying date was the30th June, 1946, should be available early next year, and it is accordingly suggested that the proposed legislation should require the fresh review to^bebased on the distribution of the electorate shown in that register. The reportsof the Commissions might then be expected in time to enable a RedistributionBill to be introduced early in the 1947-48 Session.J. C. E.J. W.31st October, 1946.
