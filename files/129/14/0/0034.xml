(ij.6) k3k26TH NOVEMBER,   19U6ILLEGAL IMMIGRATIONARRESTJ: AND&quot;. DIVERSION&apos;0F SHIPS ON THE HIGH SEASMemorandum, by the First Lord, of the AdmiraltyThe Coraman&amp;er-in-Chi ef , Medi terranean,after discussion with the High Commissioner forPalestine and balancing the practical difficultiesagainst the advantages to be gained, hasrepresented that he should, be given authorityto arrest on the high seas certain specifiedcategories of vessels  suspected of carryingillegal Jewish immigrants.      This is a proposalwith important implications,  and. following con-sultation with the Foreign Office and ColonialOffice, I set out the salient features in thefollowing paragraphs for considerat ion by the Cabinet.2.        When the Navy receives intelligence of a shipsuspected of carrying illegal immigrants to Palestine,the present practice is to make contact with heron the high seas,  check her bona fides, shadow heruntil she reaches Palestine, territorial waters, andthen&quot; arrest her before she reaches port.3.       Recently this procedure has become moredifficult for the following reasons :-(1) faster and heavier ships,  such as ex-Ganadian corvettes, are be ing use d.for the traffic-(2) the dews are becoming more determineda n d. h y s t eric a 1.(3) the number of ships engaged in thetraffic is increasing,  no doubtbecause the Jews hope to make thetask of the patrol more difficult,and. to saturate the accommodationat Cyprus which is known by all tobe limited..

h. The boarding and arrest of a ship capableof 15 knots and manned by a resolute crew,  alwaysan extremely hazardous operation,  is particularlyso within the limits imposed by territorial waters;    itis a most difficult feat of seamanship on the -partof the Captain of the. Boarding Ship to range his shipalongside a fast moving opponent without damage toboth ships and probable loss of life.      If theintercepting ship cannot range alongside, shehas no alternative, but to open fire on the bridgeof the immigrant carrier,  since shots across thebows have no effect on the Jews in their present mood;it cannot be hoped that this will not lead to casualties.If a number of ships arrive together, more sea-roomfor interception than is available in territorialwater may be essential.5. I therefore feel that &quot;the time has come to giveauthority to the Commanding Officers of His Majesty&apos;s Shipsto arrest on the high seas should they consider this to beexpedient : -(a) ships of unrecognised flag.(b) ships with no identifiable masterand crew.(c) ships of Bulgarian, Italian,  andRoumanian flag until peace treatieswith those countries are ratified.o. The arresting of these categories of ship can bejustified on the following grounds :-(a) that a ship which carries no recognisableflag enjoys no protection whatever underInternational Law (vide Cppehheim Volume I,paragraphs 258 and 26l).(b) that a ship with no identifiable masterand crew is failing also to fulfil thereouirements of International Law withregard to vessels,  since these includethe carrying of proper ships&apos; paperswith a muster-roll shewing who themaster and crew are.    (Oppenheim 262).7* I realise that to interfere with foreign shipson the high seas is not ordinarily permitted, by Internationalusage,  and. that in doing so H:&apos;.s Majesty&apos;s Government exposethemselves to criticism, and d/en retaliation.      But as thetraffic is itself illegal, a .d as arrest on the high seasmay on occasion avoid the d tnger to life and propertyinvolved in intercept ion if  territorial waters, I considerthat all ships engaged, in it could with every moraljustification be so arrested.      I recognise, however, thatthe I alostine question is one in which passions are very easilyaroused against this cowatry,  and I am therefore confiningmy proposals for arrests on the high seas to those categoriesmentioned in the prec ding paragraph.      It is difficult to seewhat State could off etively challenge our action insuch cases.Lot.26th November,

302 n8. At present, the would-be immigrants are transhippedat Haifa into British merchant ships, and transportedto Cyprus,  whore they are detained on a certificate fromthe Commanding Officer of the escort that they wereattempting to immigrate illegally into ialestine.      Whethersuch a certificate could be given in the case of shipsintercepted before they had reached territorial waters Iwould depend on the evidence produced by visit and search: jbut I am advised that there is no prime facie reason \why it should not.9. If permission can be given for arrest on the highseas,  and if the Commanding Officer&apos;s certificate is validin such cases,  it immediately becomes possible to considera further step,  namely, the diversion of the  illegalcarrier direct to Cyprus without entering Palestine waters.In view of the  increasing difficulties attendant upontranshipping the immigrants at Haifa, anything which wouldobviate this would obviously be advantageous.10.        There ore, of course, many practical difficultiesabout diversion direct to Cyprus:     not all the shipsused for this traffic are well found;    many are unseaworthy,all are overcrowded, and any diversion increasing thelength of voyage of such ships would, perhaps cause unduedanger and hardship;    it might be simpler to allow theship to continue to proceed towards the desired destinationthan to attempt to force her in a different directionagainst her will;    the shortage of provisions and. waterand overcrowding would make it difficult to accommodatethe necessary guards;    and all these difficulties Would bemuch greater in bad weather.11.        Nevertheless, if it were possible to intercept nearand divert to Cyprus,  it would be advantageous io do so andto avoid the difficulties now experienced at Haifa.      Itherefore conclude that discretion should be given to theCommanding Officers of His Majesty&apos;s Ships to divert directto Cyprus ships arrested on the high seas in accordancewith paragraph 5.      I expect that the number of suchdiversions would be small in relation to the number of arrests.12.        I am advised by the Secretary of State fertile Coloniesthat it would - not bo intra vires to legislate in Cyprusfor the forfeiture of ships and the prosecution of Mastersand crews of vessels in respect of a potential offenceagainst the laws of Palestine.      Urgent examination is beingmade to see whether powers exist,  or can be taken,  to providefor temporary detention of the ships only.      The advantageof sending ships into Cyprus may,  in some eases, outweigh.the disadvantages of not being able to confiscate or detain,and it seems best that the authorities on the spot shouldhave discretion to deal with individual cases.      The legalposition as regards ships sent into a Palestine port fromthe high seas is that the Courts have hitherto orderedthe confiscation of ships,  but have declined to convict the crews.13. Id therefore,  seek the approval of the Cabinet to thepolicy described in paragraphs 3 and 1.1  above.(Intld. )    II.dmirally,Whitehall,London,  S. P. 1.26th November, 1946. ?
