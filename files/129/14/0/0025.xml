(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PSOPEKTY OF HIS BKITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVliRI\fI4ENT)206CONFIDENTIALC. R ( 46 ) 42515th November, 1946 COPY NO   PcjCABINETVISIT BY PaRLI a!&apos;iBNTARY DELEGATION TO BURMAMemorandum by die Secretary of State for BurmaThe Governor of Burma has strongly recommended that,in addition to an immediate visit by an official of theBurma Office, there should be, at the beginning of 1947,a visit by a Parliamentary Delegation.2.     He considers that a visit by such a delegation,whrich indeed has been suggested to him by the leaderof the most prominent political party in Burma, wouldtia ve a valuable sedative effect and would help him indealing with the increasingly difficult politicalsituation which he has to handle.     It would have thefarther advantage of helping to bridge the gap betweennow and the Burma elections which are due to start on2nd April, 1947.3.     The India and Burma Committee considered, theseproposals at their meeting on 13th November, (I.B.(46)6th Meeting: Minute 1).     They approved the visit by anofficial and agreed that, subject to the approval of theCabinet, there would be advantage in a Parliamentarydelegation drawn from all parties, not larger than thedelegation which visited India at the beginning of thisyear, to serve as a goodwill mission.4.     The personality of the leader will be of the firstimportance, and the India, and Burma Committee feltthat the selection of the remaining personnel of themission was hardly less so, and that, in particular,having regard to the prominent part played by Burmesewomen in affairs, it would be desirable that thedelegation should include a woman member.S. The announcement would have to be made simultaneouslyin both Houses, and miaht, following the Indian precedent,be on the following lines:-&quot;The Governor of Burma has suggested to H. M. G. thatthere will be much advantage in a visit during theChristmas Recess by a Parliamentary Delegationsimilar to that which visited India at the beginning. of this year.

-2-P. -L.Office,15th November, 1946.H. M. G.  are in full sympathy with the Governorsproposal and agree as to&apos;the&quot;advantage of a visit by adelegation.     After consult, at ion with the leaders ofthe Opposition parties they would now propose thata parliamentary delegation should proceed to Burma atthe beginning of the year and perhaps spend about amonth in that country.     The delegation will contain &apos;representatives from another place nominated by theLord Chancellor and you, -Sir,&quot;have kindly agreed, ifthe House so desires, to nominate the members fromthis House.As in the case of the delegation which visited India,the- Burma delegation will not be in any sense chargedwith making an; Official enquiry, nor will they beasked to make any formal report. -.   The members of thedelegation will go out as representatives of Parliamentto make personal contacts, ascertain individual views,and convey to leading Burmans the broad generalattitude of the chief political parties in thiscountry and the goodwill which is felt in all quartersin this country towards Burma&apos;s progress in theconstitutional field.&quot;It is desirable that an announcement should be made at avery early date.     A Question, already placed on theOrder paper for Monday 18th November on this subject,has now&quot; been postponed till Monday 25th November.6,     I invite my colleagues:(1) to agree that there should be a Parliamentarydelegation iio Burma, to leave this country duringthe Christmas Recess, perhaps early in January(I would like to discuss the precise date withthe Governor);(2) that the delegation should be drawn from membersof both Houses and that its total strengthshould not exceed the figure of ten adoptedin the case of the Indian mission.
