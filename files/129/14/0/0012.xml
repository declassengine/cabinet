(46) 412id November, 1946CABINETDIVORCE : SECOND INTERIM REPORT BY THE DENNINGCOMMITTEEMemorandum by the Lord Chancellor1. On 13th May the Cabinet authorised me, in consultation with the HomeSecretary, to appoint a Departmental Committee to enquire into the costs anddelays involved in divorce proceedings and into certain other aspects of divorceprocedure, including the question whether jurisdiction should be exercised bythe High Court or by the County Court see CM. (46) 45th Conclusions,.Minute 10.  2. A Committee presided over by Mr. Justice Denning was set up on the26th June, 1946, and they have now issued two Interim Reports. The first,dated 30th July, 1946, was concerned with the waiting period between decreenisi and decree absolute. The Committee recommended a reduction in the periodfrom six months to six weeks, and I took steps at once (by Rule and administra-tively) to give effect to their recommendations.The second Interim Report, dated 29th October, 1946, deals with theimportant point of jurisdiction, and also with a large number of purelyprocedural matters.   This Report is circulated herewith.3. It will be seen that the Committee have reached the unanimous conclusionthat jurisdiction to grant divorce should remain solely in the High Court- paragraphs 4 to 12. But they recommend that the County Court Judges shouldlie appointed to sit as Commissioners to try divorce, both in London and in theprovinces and that the King&apos;s Bench Judges should cease to try undefendeddivorce on Circuit. The jurisdiction of the County Court Judges would notlimited to undefended cases but in practice the defended cases would haveto be left to the Divorce Judges and to the King&apos;s Bench Judges on Circuit.he Committee report that their conclusions are supported by the evidence which[hey have received, and they make the point that, under the system proposedcoupled with the procedural reforms advocated), a substantial reduction in costsid a real saving in time will be effected.The Committee also point out that their recommendations can be given effectowithout legislation; the County Court Judges can be appointed as Commis-loners under the powers granted by Section 70 of the Supreme Court ofidioature (Consolidation) Act, 1925.4. I recommend the adoption of the Denning Committee&apos;s proposals. I&apos;^&apos;e reason to believe that they have the support of the Lord Chief Justice, and*e Archbishop of Canterbury, and I am told that they are supported by thepurity Court Judges, the Bar Council, the Law Society, the Legal and Judicialjroup 0f the Parliamentary Labour Party, and the Haldane Society. Theresident of the Divorce Division has told me that he cannot approve the proposalj1 appoint the County Court Judges as Commissioners-indeed that he may feelI bis duty to oppose it in the House of Lords. He thinks that if the Countyl%t Judges are appointed as Commissioners, the impression in the public mindI I be that divorce has been sent to the County Court, whatever the form of thel,risdiction exercisable by them may be. I cannot agree with this view, andf any event I consider that the County Court Judges must be made use of,.I    [32649]Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1946-    136
in one form or another, if the tremendous mass of cases is to be disposed of II have had to appoint thirteen County Court Judges to sit as Commissioners offAssize or as Special Commissioners in London during this term alone, becausjit has proved impossible to find Silks in the quantities and of the standard!required. Thus, in a sense, I have been compelled by force of circumstances!to adopt a course identical with that advocated by the Denning Committee.5; The proposal to appoint the County Court Judges to act as CommisIsioners will involve increased expenditure. The Committee recommend thaiCommissioners should receive payment at the same rate as a High Court Judgeon the days on which they sit paragraph 11 (vi). The annual charges for theCounty Court Judges as Commissioners might be of the order of  I5,00(liincluding the salaries of two additional Judges whose appointment wouldprobably be necessary. This figure compares favourably with the cost ofappointing High Court Judges in sufficient numbers to dispose of the cases&apos;(from four to six, costing  20,000 to  30,000).6. I greatly welcome the proposals made by the Committee for reformingthe procedure for trying divorce suits paragraphs 13 to 100 of the ReportThere is obviously much dead wood to be cut out, and it is satisfactory to see:that almost all the recommendations can be given effect to by Rule or adminisitrative action. I am already in touch with the President and his officials on thilaspect of the Report.7. The Denning Committee are now proceeding to consider the questionof machinery for effecting reconciliation, and I expect a further Report from!them within a very few weeks.8. If the Cabinet give general approval to the Second Interim ReporlI ask for authority (1) to announce its acceptance in the House of Lords, and to publish it; 1(2) to take the steps necessary to give effect to all the recommendations madlJ.

SECOND INTERIM REPORT J^QTo the Right Honourable the Lord Jowitt,Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.. i. Since presenting our First Interim Report in July, 1946, we have madeconsiderable progress. We have received much evidence on all the subjectsreferred to us and we have been able to reach clear conclusions on manyof them. We have not indeed reached the end of our work, but the needfor action appears to us so urgent that we have decided to present this SecondInterim Report.2. We have approached our deliberations on the basis that, before con-sidering detailed reforms, we must clear our minds on the two main questionsreferred to us namely, in what Courts ought matrimonial suits to proceed,and whether any machinery for reconciliation should be made available.3. We are still engaged in hearing evidence on the question of reconcilia-tion, and we must reserve our conclusions on it until our final report.. Allwe need say upon it at this stage is that any means for effecting reconciliationmust function separately from judicial procedure. This conclusion enablesns. to turn to the other question.I. JURISDICTION.4. The question of Courts has already received much consideration byRoyal Commissions and by Committees. We have had further evidenceupon it and have further considered it, and we desire specifically to re-affirmthe principle stated by the Royal Commission of 1912 that &quot; the &quot;gravity ofdivorce and other matrimonial cases, affecting as they do the family life,the status of the parties, the interests of their children, and the interestsof the State in the moral and social well-being of its citizens,. makes itdesirable to provide, if possible, that, even for the poorest persons, thesecases should be determined by the Superior Courts of the country, assistedby the attendance of the Bar, which we regard as of high importance indivorce and matrimonial cases, both in the interest of the parties and in thepublic interest &quot;. In our opinion the attitude of the community towards thestatus of marriage is much influenced by the way in which divorce iseffected. If there is a careful and dignified proceeding such as obtains inthe High Court for the undoing of a marriage, then quite unconsciouslythe people will have a much more respectful view of the marriage tie andof the marriage status than they would if divorce were effected informallyin an inferior court.5. The difficulty at the present day is to maintain that principle in theface of the large increase in the number of cases. The fact is that thereare not enough High Court Judges to deal with the increased number ofcases. Although this increase has been influenced considerably by theconditions produced by the recent war, nevertheless the numbers are likelyto remain higher in the future than they have been in the past.6. Many of the problems which faced our predecessors can now be testedin the light of experience. In our opinion experience has proved thefollowing:  (i) Trial of divorce cases as part of the existing assize system is a failure.At the large centres of population such as Liverpool, Manchester, Leedsand Birmingham, Judges of the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Division(hereinafter referred to as the Divorce Division) have gone to take the536i5 &quot; A 4
divorce work at the same time &quot;as the King&apos;s Bench judges take the criminal tand civil work, but it has been found that such inconvenience has resultedthat an Order in Council has recently been specially passed to enable theJudges of the Divorce Division to take the divorce work at those placeswhen the King&apos;? Bench Judges are not there. At other towns the King&apos;sBench Judges have tried to take the divorce work in addition to their otherwork, but in fact they have not the time for this and; there have been manycomplaints of chaotic and indecorous conditions. We have been informedof one town where &quot; at the Summer Assize in 194p.no less than 320 cases,including 20 defended cases (not merely discretion cases), were heard insix and a half days and the scenes outside the courts were described asmore reminiscent of Epsom Downs than a court of justice &quot;.(ii). Trial (by a- Judge of the Divorce Division proceeding round, thecountry is a success so far as the provinces are concerned, but a failure sofar as London is affected. It has long been a tradition that a High CourtJudge, when holding the Assizes, completes all the work in the lists, ifthat is possible. The Judges of the Divorce Division have worthily main-tained that tradition but the result has been that they have been away fromLondon for long periods; The lists in the provinces have been cleared at theexpense of the London suitors. The London lists have mounted becausethere have not been enough Judges to try them. The London list for&quot; thepresent term is a total of 7,284 cases of which 6,192 are undefended, 983are defended and 109 are part heard. It is anticipated that, under existingconditions, little more than one-third of those cases will betaken this term,even with the help of two special commissioners for the cases of service menand women; and already there are in addition a large number of cases setdown for trial in the Hilary Sittings which commence in January 1947-.(iii) The work done by District Registrars and their staffs in theprovinces is a success. There are fifty nine High Court Registries in theprovinces in which divorce petitions are filed and all interlocutory proceed-ings up to and after trial are transacted. In 1945 they dealt with over9,000 petitions and proved themselves fully capable of dealing with thework.      &apos;(iv) The costs of divorce proceedings are much too high. We have&apos;. had evidence showing that the cost of an ordinary, undefended divorcecase is  70 and may well be more.   There are several reasons for this:(a) The High Court procedure has many requirements, such asaffidavits and searches, which are unnecessary; A thorough reformof procedure would reduce the costs considerably.(&amp;) The attendance of. witnesses is expensive, especially when they. have to travel long distances and stay the night.   These can be..     reduced by increased facilities for admitting statements and affidavitsin evidence, and * by hearing the cases at accessible places in theprovinces on fixed days.(c) The employment of counsel (who have the exclusive right ofaudience in the High Court) is expensive. In the past many counselhave conducted innumerable poor persons cases without any fee at all,whereas another counsel on one day may have fen or more undefendedcases receiving six guineas for each. A rule has recently been madeenabling counsel in poor persons cases to receive a fee of one guineafor an undefended case and three guineas for a defended case, a feewhich is sufficient to act as an encouragement to a beginner who hasonly one or two, cases in that Court.   We think that it should be
possible for the fees in other cases to be reduced to a level which isnot only an encouragement to beginners but is remunerative to themore experienced counsel who has a number of cases in the list. Feesshould not be fixed by rule of thumb. They should depend on thedifficulty of the case, the means of the parties, and the standing of thecounsel engaged.7. In addition to the lessons of experience the following factors mustbe taken into account:  (i) There is a number of judges who are available to undertake divorcework if they should be asked to do so, namely, the County Court Judges.The volume of county court work declined steeply during the war andjurisdiction under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts will shortly cease.It is anticipated that, with rare exceptions, County Court Judges couldundertake additional judicial duties if required. It would not he over-optimistic to assume that on an average each of the 57 County CourtJudges could devote 20 days a year to the trial of matrimonial cases,sitting one or more days at a time. Assuming that 25 undefended casescould be heard at each sitting, this would mean that each Judge could,if called upon, dispose of 500 cases a year, making a total for all the57 Judges of 28,500 cases a year.(ii) There is no doubt that the County Court Judges would handlematrimonial cases with efficiency and a full sense of responsibility. Theassumption that divorce involves a peculiar discretion which only a fewknow how to exercise is not valid. The increased number of cases hasmeant a diffusion of knowledge throughout the profession. Only a few ofthe past or present Judges of the Probate Divorce &amp; Admiralty Divisionspecialised in divorce work before they were appointed to the Bench. Themajority had practised at the Admiralty or Common law bar. Many King&apos;sBench and Chancery Judges and Commissioners have tried divorce caseswith nO previous experience of them. The counsel who conduct the casesare often members of the common law bar, and especially so on circuit.(iii) It would not be practicable to try divorce cases at every one ofthe 400 places at which County Court sittings are held. The legalprofession could not conduct with expedition and economy a large numberof matrimonial suits if they were to be conducted in a great number ofcourts. Divorce cases must be tried at selected centres and those shouldbe places where there is a District Divorce Registry of the High Court thoughnot necessarily at every one of the 59 places. It is not unimportant tonotice that in all the 59 District Divorce Registries except Manchester thesame person is both High Court Registrar and County Court Registrar. ,8. The foregoing considerations lead us to the following conclusions:  1. The High Court jurisdiction should be maintained in London andthe provinces but undefended divorce cases should no longer be tried byKing&apos;s Bench Judges as part of the ordinary work of Assizes.2. The County Court Judges should be appointed Commissioners formatrimonial causes so as to supplement the number of Judges availablefor such cases in London and the provinces. &apos;&apos; 3. The High Court procedure in Divorce cases should be reformed so asto effect a substantial reduction in costs,
We are the more encouraged to make these recommendations because ofthe general agreement of the witnesses who have given evidence on the point.There was a great deal of evidence in favour of the High Court jurisdictionbeing maintained but all the witnesses realised that the number of JudgesWould need to be supplemented by Commissioners. The witnesses whoadvocated the transfer of divorce cases to the County Courts as such did solargely for the sake of expedition and reducing costs and would have noobjection to the High Court jurisdiction if the procedure was reformed so asto effect this object. The course which we propose of appointing the CountyCourt Judges as Commissioners of the High Court commanded generalapproval.9. We desire to record that these conclusions correspond in principle withthose reached by the Royal Commission of 1912. That Commission satfor three years and presented a notable report covering the whole field ofdivorce and matrimonial causes. The recommendations of the majority asto the substantive law have largely been adopted in the Matrimonial CausesAct, 1937. Their recommendation with regard to the Courts have nothitherto been adopted. They rejected the suggestions of trial of divorcecases at assizes, and of Divorce Judges proceeding round the country, forreasons which experience has since proved to be correct. They rejected thesuggestion of trial by the County Courts as such, principally for the reason,which still aopears to us sufficient, that it does not pay adequate regard tothe significance and the public importance attaching to matrimonial causesof every kind. They reached the conclusion that the problem was to be solvedby the, High Court jurisdiction being exercised by County Court Judgessitting as Commissioners. It gives us confidence to find that our conclusionscorrespond in principle with those reached by them. They did suggest,however, that only 8 or 10 selected County Court Judges should be appointedCommissioners and that between them they should do all the divorce workin the country, each Commissioner doing all the work in his allotted districtas well as some or all of his ordinary county court work. The increased numberof cases makes that suggestion inapplicable today. If only 8 or 10 CountyCourt Judges were appointed Commissioners, it would mean that each wouldhave so much divorce work to do that he would not be able to do any of hisordinary County Court work and would have to appoint deputies. It woulddetract much from the efficiency of the County Courts if selected Judges weretaken from their Courts for long periods and their places taken by deputies.To avoid this we are of opinion that all the County Court Judges shouldbe appointed Commissioners, and then each should be able to dovetail thedivorce work with his County Court work. Furthermore the smooth workingof the County Court system is due largely to the fact that the number ofJudges is sufficient to enable them to assist one another in case of need.If all are appointed Commissioners for matrimonial cases they will be ableto render one another the same assistance in those cases also. For instanceit would be possible for- the County Court Judges in the London area toarrange for two of their number to sit by rotation in the High Court through--out the year.10. Whilst we propose that, all County Court Judges should be appointedCommissioners, that does not mean that other suitable persons should not beappointed from time to time. We propose specifically the County CourtJudges because they form at once a body of persons suitable and available insufficient numbers to deal with the work and offer a solution which mightbecome permanent, but there are other suitable persons holding judicial officeand qualified to be Commissioners of Assize who might also be appointedif the pressure of work demanded it.
14ii. Our conclusions in point of principle need, however, to be worked outin detail:(i) The Commissioners should have all the jurisdiction of a High CourtJudge in divorce and matrimonial cases. They should have power to tryboth undefended and defended cases. If they were restricted to undefendedcases, it would mean that they would be regarded as Courts of inferiorjurisdiction which in our opinion is undesirable. They will be somewhatrestricted in point of practice, however, because they will not be able tosit long at a stretch owing to the fact that they have also to sit in theirCounty Courts. That means that ithey will usually confine themselves tothe undefended cases and the shorter defended cases leaving the heavierdefended cases to the Judges who can sit continuously.(ii) The Commissioners should sit in London and at the Assize townswhere divorce business is now taken, but not at the same time as theAssizes. (In passing we would say that some additions should be made tothe list of those towns and the Commissioners should also sit for divorce workat a number of important towns where there are at present no assizes.)The Commissioners should sit in Courts commensurate with the dignityof the High Court, such as those in the Royal Courts of Justice in Londonand those used by Judges of Assize in the Assize towns or by QuarterSessions in other towns, wherever they are available.(hi) Each Commissioner should be available to sit in London or suchother town as is most convenient, having regard to the volume of businessto be transacted and to the situation and demands of his other work.There should be a sufficient number of Commissioners available for eachtown to deal with the business there. They should arrange between them-selves the days on which each shall sit. The days should be fixed well inadvance. If that is done the Registrar will be able to fix dates in advancefor the hearing of the cases. One of the advantages of the County Courtsystem is that the hearing of a case is fixed in advance for a particularday, and sometimes for a particular time of the day, and there is noreason why the same system should not apply when the Judges sit asCommissioners of the High Court.(iv) The Commissioners should deal with applications for custody ofchildren and like matters, for the advantage of a local system is theavailability of a Judge within reasonable distance.(v) The Commissioners should be accorded all the dignity of a HighCourt Judge. When sitting in Court they should wear the same robes as aJudge of the Divorce Division and be addressed in the same may as aJudge.(vi) The Commissioners should receive payment at the same rate as aHigh Court Judge for the days on which they sit as Commissioners whichwould preferably be by way of an increase in salary.(vii) The District Registrars should have all the powers of a Registrarof the Divorce Registry. The District Registrars have shown themselvesquite capable of dealing with applications for alimony pending suit, main-tenance and the like, and there is no reason why they should not .dealwith the other kinds of ancillary relief which under the present systemmust proceed in London.(viii) The District Registrars should be responsible for the administra-tion of the work of their respective towns subject however to the direction
of the Commissioners.   The Registrars have the advantage of also being: County Court Registrars and will know the various commitments of theCommissioners so as to be able to arrange the work accordingly.(ix) Our proposals have the advantage that they provide a solution forthe pressing needs of the moment and also&apos; for demands of the future.They can be put immediately into operation without the necessity oflegislation. There is a wide power in Section 70 of the Judicature Act of1925 to appoint Commissioners. Under that Section His Majesty may bya general or special Commission assign to the persons named thereinthe duty of trying and determining, within any place or district speciallyfixed for that purpose by the Commission, any cases or matter de-pending in the High Court, including matrimonial cases of any pre-scribed class and any matters arising out of-or&apos;connected- with any suchcases. The Section specifically contemplates that any Judge of CountyCourts may be entrusted with High Court jurisdiction by being includedin a Commission of Assize. There is therefore no reason why the CountyCourt Judges should not be named in Commissions for trying matrimonialcases in the London district and in districts in the provinces. The Corn-missions should, in the first instance, be made to take effect for a limitedperiod such as a- year. If the arrangements prove satisfactory, they couldlater be put on a permanent basis by legislation. If ithe County CourtJudges are appointed, they will be able to sit as soon as the necessaryarrangements can be made, although it may take a little time to Completethe administrative side. The Divorce Registry in London and theDistrict Registries in the provinces however will operate just as. they donow, the only difference, being that more Judges will be sitting andmore frequently. The Commissioners should, in the first instance, helpto clear the. undefended lists, but as arid when that is done, they mayhave time for short defended cases and applications for custody.12. Once it is decided that the High Court Jurisdiction should be maintained,the question arises what procedural reforms should be introduced. We haveexamined the existing procedure in detail and are satisfied that by suitablereforms much delay and expense can be saved;II. PROCEDURAL REFORMS.Application for Leave to Present a Petition within 3 Years ofMarriage13. Under Section r of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1937, a petition fordiyorce cannot be presented within 3 years from the date of marriage exceptby leave of a Judge, and then only on the ground of exceptional hardshipsuffered by the petitioner or of exceptional depravity of the respondent. Atpresent the procedure to obtain leave is not satisfactory. The Rules of Courtprovide for first, an appointment before a Registrar for the preliminary con-sideration of the application, and next an appointment before a. Judge forthe. determination of it. In our opinion there is no need for the matter tobe considered by a Registrar. His function is simply to investigate thequestion whether there is any reasonable probability of reconciliation betweenthe parties and to report thereon to the Judge. The hearing before him ishowever, quite unsuited for such an investigation. In the great majority ofcases the applicants solicitor alone attends. If, as is often the case, it isasserted that there is no possibility of reconciliation the Registrar has no optionbut to report accordingly. The matter can be equally well, and indeed better,dealt with by the Judge when it comes .befpre him&apos;.     .     ..   .,:
. x4- ,T1?e Rules of Court also provide that the Judge shall hear these applica-tions &quot;in chambers &quot;, This means that the proceedings are in private andthe decisions are not reported, with the result that there is no guidance avail-able to litigants as to what is considered to be &quot; exceptional hardship &quot; suf-fered by the petitioner, or &quot; exceptional depravity &quot; on the part of. therespondent; and indeed the views of one judge on the point may differ fromthat of another. It is important that this jurisdiction should be exercised.onuniform and settled lines. This can be done if the Rule is modified so as topermit the Judge to give his reasons in open Court if he should think proper,,without the names of the parties being mentioned.15. The Rules of Court also provide an elaborate machinery wherebynotice of these applications is to be personally served, appearance entered,affidavits filed and so forth; whereas the Statute seems to contemplate a simpleapphcation at that stage, leaving the full investigation for the hearing of thepetition. We recommend that the proceedings should be by originating sum-mons supported by affidavit, for a fixed day at which the Respondent maybe heard without the necessity of entering an appearance.Contents of Petition16. The Rules of Court require that the petition in a matrimonial causeshall contain certain information. In our opinion the rules as to what shouldbe contained in a petition should be altered in these respects:-1. At present the petition has to set out the; matrimonial offence that. :is alleged, Le^adultery, desertion or cruelty, but curiously enough the Rulesdo not provide that the petition should set out the material facts from whichthe Court is asked to infer that the offence has been committed. TheCourts have supplemented the Rules by stating that in cases of desertioncertain particulars should be given; and in practice in cases of crueltyand adultery particulars are usually given. In our opinion, the existingprocedure should be enforced by a specific Rule that in every case allmaterial facts should be set out with full particulars.2. At present the Petitioner can make some claims in the petition butnot all of them. The Petitioner may claim alimony pending suit in thepetition but cannot claim maintenance until after the time for enteringappearance has expired, and then she has to issue a separate application withall the expense of separate personal service and so forth. There is no reasonwhy she should not be permitted to make all her claims in the petition, butwithout prejudice to her right to make them later if she so desires.3. At present the Petitioner has to. sign the petition, but not his counselnor his solicitor. Whilst we consider it important that the Petitionershould sign his petition, we are of opinion that in addition, when settledby counsel, it should be signed by him, and if not so settled, it shouldbe signed by the solicitor1&apos;who prepared it. This is the rule as to plead-ings in other Divisions of the . High Court and we think the same ruleshould apply in the Divorce Division. The Court can then justifiably look&apos; to the counsel or solicitor concerned to see that the Rules have been com-\ plied with and can dispense with examination by its own clerks.; Affidavit in Support of Petition17. At present every Petitioner has to file an affidavit in support of hispetition. This is unnecessary because the signature of the Petitioner is suffi-pient verification at that stage and he eventually gives evidence at the hearingyerifying on oath everything in the petition that he is asked to verify.  If
the affidavit is dispensed with, however, the petition should deal with collu-sion, condonation and connivance, and other topics in the manner that theaffidavit now does.18. The abolition of the affidavit in support will not only save the costsof the affidavit but will also save the cost of re-swearing the affidavit as hasoften been necessary hitherto. It will also dispose of some incidental direc-tions which had led to delay and expense, such as that, in a case of desertion,the supporting affidavit must be sworn not more than 7 days before the petitionis presented.Examination of Petition19. At present, when a petition is presented at the Registry, it is accompaniedby the supporting affidavit and the Marriage Certificate. Before it is acceptedit is examined by the clerks in the Registry to see if it is in order. Thisexamination takes a considerable time, and when there is a number ofsolicitors or their clerks presenting petitions it means that queues form whilethe documents are being examined, and some may have to wait long beforetheir turn comes. Apart from this, the clerks in the Registry are under aduty to see that the documents are correct and comply with the Rules inevery detail, and this leads them to reject them for minor slips or clericalerrors. Inasmuch as the petitions are usually settled by counsel or byexperienced solicitors, there are rarely any major errors, but there are oftenminor errors which do not affect the substance of the case at all. Neverthe-less some of the clerks feel they cannot pass them. When that happens, itfrequently means that the solicitor has to take the document away, correctthe error, ask the Petitioner to initial the correction and swear the supportingaffidavit again.20. There is nothing in the Rules to require a preliminary examinationby the clerks and in our opinion it is unnecessary. The solicitor who presentsthe petition is responsible for seeing that it is in order and the responsibilityshould be left with him. That is the case in other Divisions of the HighCourt and we see ho reason why the position should be different in the DivorceDivision. It is to emphasise this responsibility that we propose that thecounsel or solicitor responsible for the pleading should/sign it. If errors aremade, counsel or Judge will detect them at the trial and that shouldsuffice.. . Making Office Copies.21. At present the Rules require that an &quot; Office Copy &quot; of the petitionshould be served on the Respondent. An &quot; Office Copy &quot; is a copy whichis examined against the original in the Registry and sealed. The obtainingof an Office Copy is a source of much delay. It may be a typed copy madeby the clerks of the Registry which may take weeks, or it may be madeby the solicitor himself, but in that case the Registry require it to be a topcopy and the clerks then have to examine it with the original in order to seethat the copy is correct, a procedure which may take from one to six weeks.Even if the solicitor hands in lithographed copies which are obviously thesame, it still takes a long time to obtain an &quot;. Office Copy &quot;. A Rule hasrecently been made, enabling the Registry to issue photographic copies. ThisRule has been applied in respect of petitions presented by the Services DivorveDepartment! of The. Law Society and has proved of great advantage, butthere is difficulty in obtaining sufficient photostatic equipment, paper and. staffto enable it to be exfended^o other petitions;. This difficulty may persist for^spme
time. Meanwhile we would observe that, in the other Divisions of the HighCourt, the solicitor is entrusted with the making of correct copies, and wesee no reason why the same should not apply in the Divorce Division.22. We think that a new practice should be adopted whereby the solicitorpresents the original petition and one or two copies, as the case may be,which he certifies on them to be correct copies of the original. The Registryshould stamp and seal the original and retain it at the Registry, and shouldseal the copies at once and issue them for service.Numbering Petitions23. At present there is often difficulty and delay in the Divorce Registryin finding the papers in a particular case. We are of opinion that the systemcould be much improved if each petition when filed, were distinguished fromthe outset by the year, a letter and a number in the same way as causes inother Divisions of the High Court are distinguished, and a cause book kepton the same lines as the Cause Books in other Divisions.Service24. At present the Rules of Court provide that, unless otherwise directed,an Office Copy of every petition shall be served personally upon everyrespondent, and that personal service shall in no case be effected by thePetitioner. This requirement means as a rule that someone such as a solicitoror his clerk or a process server or an enquiry agent has to call on eachRespondent and serve the petition on him personally. Then that personhas to prepare an affidavit of service showing his means of knowledge ofidentity of the person served. That means that the identity of the Respondentmust be established and it is usually done in one of the following ways, either:(1) by the Petitioner accompanying the person who.serves the petition andidentifying the Respondent then and there; or (2) by the Respondent signinga form acknowledging service and the signature being afterwards identifiedby the Petitioner; or (3) by means of a photograph which the Petitionerstates is a photograph of the Respondent and which the person who servesthe petition states is a photograph of the person served. These requirementsfor service are more elaborate than in any other legal process. They aremuch more costly in time and money. In our opinion the rules as to servicein the Divorce Court are more elaborate thjan is necessary. Thei objectof service is only to give notice of the petition to each Respondent so that hemay be made aware of it, and be able to answer it. The general practice ofasking the Respondent to sign an acknowledgement of service leads us tosuggest that personal service is unnecessary where such an acknowledgementis signed. In our opinion a petition should be held to be validly served if it isserved by registered post on the Respondent, co-respondent or woman named,and if an acknowledgement in writing of identity and service is signed andreturned by the person concerned to the Divorce Registry. The delivery by apostman of a registered letter is at least as telling a notice as delivery of apetition by a clerk or process server or enquiry agent. The signing and return-ing of an acknowledgement is at least as voluntary and reliable an acknow-ledgement as one signed in the presence of a process server or enquiry agent.The Petitioner will usually be able to prove the handwriting of the Respondenton the acknowledgement so that his identity will be clearly established, whichis very desirable as it is his status which is being affected. But the Petitionermay not be able to prove the handwriting of the Co-respondent. Thisleads to injustice under the present Rules because, although a Co-respondent
has signed an acknowledgement of service, the Petitioner often fails to obtainan order for costs against him simply because the Petitioner does not know &quot;the Co-respondents handwriting. In our opinion if a Co-respondent purportsto have signed an acknowledgement and returned it, no formal proof of hand-writing is necessary. No one is likely to sign and return such an acknowledge-ment unless he is in fact the person named. At any rate the&apos; chances of a thirdperson signing and returning it without authority are so remote that theycan be ignored; and if it should happen, the person whose name had beenused without authority would be able to have any order against him set aside,so that no injustice would be done.25. We would add that it has been the normal practice to allow service byregistered post out of the jurisdiction provided a signed acknowledgement isreturned. This practice has been extensively used in case of service onmembers of the forces, and we see no reason why it should not apply alsowithin the jurisdiction.26. If no signed acknowledgement is returned to the Divorce Registry, thePetitioner will be left to effect personal service as heretofore, but if thatis impracticable, he may apply for leave to dispense with further service,which the Court would grant if satisfied on the evidence that the documentshad reached the Respondent.Service in Lunacy Cases27. In lunacy cases the Petitioner has first to serve the petition on themedical superintendent of the institution where the patient is, and second toapply for the Official Solicitor to be appointed guardian ad Mem and thenserve him with the petition. To avoid this double service, we recommendthat, if the Official Solicitor consents, he should be appointed guardian ad litembefore service and then service be effected on him.Substituted Service. 28. There is a number of cases where the address of the Respondent,Co-respondent, or woman named is not known, and he or she cannot betraced. In such cases the Court allows substituted service by advertisement,but before doing so requires to be satisfied that proper steps have been takento find the person. The cost of the inquiries and of the subsequent advertise-ment is sometimes so high as to be a real hardship. Cases have been broughtto our notice where the cost of the advertisement is  20 or more and poorpersons have been unable to raise the money and have had to abandon theircases in consequence. The suggestion has been made that service by advertise-ment should be by means of an official advertisement published by the DivorceRegistry on certain fixed days at reasonably frequent intervals. This sugges-tion seems to us to be a good one and we recommend its adoption. A similarprocedure is already in force with regard to advertisements in the LondonGazette on trust matters under s. 27 of the Trustee Act, 1925. The noticepublished by the Divorce Registry could be in a standard form with thetitle of the cause and of the actual parties to be served set out below. Thiswould reduce the cost of advertisement considerably, as the general noticewould only have to be inserted once for all advertisements on that date.It would also enable poor persons to advertise free, and prevent them havingto abandon their cases because they are unable to pay the newspaper charges.
2q- In any case service by advertisement; should be required only on theRespondent and not on the Co-respondent or woman named unless relief issought against him or her.Service out of the Jurisdiction30. The proposal we have made for service by registered post should beapplied with any necessary modifications to service out of the jurisdiction.Also the periods at present allowed for appearance are much too long. Forinstance when the Chairman visited the Divorce Registry he noticed by chancea case in which in a Petition filed in April, 1946, as long as 150 days wasallowed to a Respondent in Malaya to appear.31. Ihe times for appearance should in all cases be greatly reduced in viewof the increased facilities for communication by air mail. Order 11 Rule 5 ofthe Rules of the Supreme Court expressly provides that the time limited forappearance shall depend on whether the air mail is available to the Defendant.This works satisfactorily in other Divisions of the High Court, because therethe Plaintiff has to obtain leave to serve the process and the Court whengiving leave fixes the time for appearance. In the Divorce Division, however,process can be served out of the jurisdiction without the leave of the Court,and the times for appearance are not fixed by a judicial officer but are insertedby the Clerks in the Registry according to a table of times which is issued tothem. This table of times appears to be calculated on the basis that land andsea mail is open to the Respondent but not air mail. It needs immediaterevision on the basis that air mail is now usually available to a Respondent.Notice to Appear and Entry of Appearance32. At present the Rules of Court provide that a petition must be endorsedwith a &quot; notice to appear &quot;, and that a Respondent who wishes to appearmust &quot; enter an appearance &quot;and thereafter make &quot; answer &quot; to the petition.If he fails to &quot; enter an appearance &quot;, or if, having entered an &quot; appearance &quot;,he fails to put in an &quot; answer &quot;, the case is treated as an undefended case.33. While practically all Petitioners have solicitors to act for them, themajority of Respondents have not. Many of them do not understand whatis meant by &quot; notice to appear&quot;, &quot; entry of appearance &quot; and &quot; answer &quot;.Those who are really determined to defend the case probably do go to asolicitor and get the formalities completed, but there is a large number ofrespondents who- do not wish to defend the case, but would like to be heardon questions of custody of children, costs, maintenance and so forth. Suchpersons sometimes do nothing, thinking that if they do not defend, they haveno voice on such matters. Others may write to the Court or to the Petitionerssolicitors indicating a wish to be heard, but the letter is not treated as an&quot; entry of appearance &quot; or as an &quot; answer &quot; either because it is not in theprescribed form or because the fee of 2s. 6d. is not paid. The position is wellstated in the evidence submitted to us by the Cambridge House Free LegalAdvice Centre in these words: &quot; If seems desirable that the views, and some-times the matrimonial history, from a respondenfs point of view, should becapable of being presented in a more informal way in order that a fair decisionon questions of ancillary relief may be obtained. We suggest that when thepetition is served a notice should be served also on the respondent, stating thathe or she may submit a statement, which will be given consideration, on thesematters of ancillary relief, without having to enter an appearance through the
formal channels.   It is frequently found that a respondent who is technicallyguilty has possible if not probable grounds for answering the petition and very/often very strong moral grounds in his or her favour &quot;. V34. We find ourselves in complete accord with those words. One of thechief difficulties in the administration of the divorce law is that in undefendedcases the Court hears only one side. This renders it difficult to investigatethe case satisfactorily. It is very important therefore that no formality orfee should deter a Respondent from being heard.35. There is no reason why any formality should attach to an &quot; entry ofappearance &quot;. In the Divorce Division an appearance is not a submission bythe Respondent to the jurisdiction of the Court, for that is determined bydomicile. It is only a step necessary to gain a right to be heard, and forthat purpose any document by which the Respondent intimates a desire to beheard should suffice so long as it is signed by him and gives his address. Onreceiving a petition, the obvious step for the layman to take is to write acknow-ledging the petition and saying that he wishes to be heard on it. That is, inlegal language, to &quot; accept service &quot; and &quot; enter an appearance &quot; at the sametime. We see no reason why any document to that effect however informal,should not be given legal force.36. Another matter which arises in regard to appearance is the practicewhereby a Respondent enters an appearance, not with any intention of defend-ing, but because he thinks he is &quot; required &quot; to enter an appearance or inorder to facilitate proof of service or to keep open the right to be heardon custody or such like. Often a solicitor for the Respondent, on receivingthe petition, at once enters an appearance and writes to the Petitionerssolicitor saying that he does not intend to file an answer. Nevertheless thePetitioner, before he can proceed, has to wait until the full time allowedfor appearance and also the full time allowed for answer has expired, beforehe can set the case down for trial, thus involving unnecessary delay. Thishas led the Services Divorce Department of The Law Society and the SolicitorsManaging Clerks&apos; Association to suggest to us that when an appearance isentered, the party should give notice whether he intends to file an answeror not, and if he has no such intention, the Petitioner should at once beentitled to set the case down for hearing.37. Several witnesses have urged that the forms of &quot; notice to appear &quot;should be revised so as to make the position clear to the party served. Theyalso point out that the prescribed notices to appear which have to beendorsed on all petitions involve considerable typing, and suggest that thesenotices should be a separate printed document addressed to the party. to beserved which could either be attached to the petition or served as a separatedocument with the petition. Thus, when the petition was filed, copies of theprinted notices could also be sealed as well as the copy petitions. This wouldgreatly reduce the typing required in solicitors&apos; offices and also would meanthat where photostat copies were made in the Registry for service, fewerpages would require to be photographed.38. These considerations lead us to the conclusion that all formalityinvolved in an &quot; appearance &quot; should be abolished. Instead, the presentmemorandum of appearance should be replaced by a document which wouldbe an acceptance of service and which would also disclose whether or notthe Respondent desired to defend or be heard, and would include an addressfor service. We have endeavoured to put our proposals into concrete form bydrafting the form of &quot; Notice &quot; and &quot; Appearance &quot;, which we recommend.The document should be a printed sheet of paper with a perforation enablingthe bottom part to be readily detached from the top part.
1462.Are you the person named as C.B. in the Petition?3. Do you intend to defend the case?(Note. If you intend to defend, you must write &quot; Yes &quot; to Question 3:and in addition, an answer to the petition must be sent to the Registrarwithin 14 days after sending in this form (or within such longer timeas the Court may allow) saying whether or not you admit the charges madeagainst you and raising any other points you have to show why a decreeof divorce should not he made against you.)4. Even if you do not intend to defend the case, do you wish to beheard on any matter connected with it? If so, state shortly what thematters are.(Note._Even if you do not intend to defend, you may wish to beheard on some matter such as the custody of or access to children; orwho should pay costs; or whether or not alimony or maintenance shouldbe paid by husband for wife or children, etc. If you wish to be heardon any matter connected with the case, write &quot; Yes &quot; to Question 4 andstate shortly what the matters are.5. What is the address to which any communications for you should besent?(Note. The address must be in England or Wales. If a solicitor isacting for you give the name and address of your solicitor.Dated....................................      Signed.....................&quot;.(Note: The signature must be.your personal signature.) . . . &apos;A stamped envelope should be provided, addressed to the Registrar.In the case of a co-respondent the Notice should be the same, but theattached form should be varied. Instead of Questions 3 and 4.there shouldbe these questions:  . ,.3. Do...you intend -to contest the charge qi adultery against you?;39. On the top part there should be printed the following:  &quot; Notice to AppearTo:- ofTake Notice that a Petition has been presented to the High Court ofJustice by. . . . A copy of it is delivered herewith. You are requested toaccept service of it and to enter an appearance. In order to do this,you should fill in the form set out below and send it to the Registrar of theHigh Court. A stamped addressed envelope is provided for the purpose.This should be done within seven days after you receive this notice. If youdo not do so within that time, the Court may, without further notice to you,proceed to hear the Petition and pronounce judgment, notwithstanding yourabsence.The Petition is filed and this notice is issued by .................................of ...................................................Dated.......................................Registrar.&quot;On the bottom part below the perforation there should be printed thefollowing:  - &quot; Appearanceto be filled in and sent to the Registrar of the High Court.1. Have you received and read a copy of the Petition?
4- Even if you do not intend to contest the charge do you wish tobe heard on the claim for (damages and) costs against you? ^In the case of a woman named, instead of Questions 3 and 4 there need&quot;5only be one question &quot;3. Do you wish to be heard on the matter? &quot;.; In nullity cases the questions 1 to 5 should be the same as in the noticeto the Respondent but the note to question 3 should stop at the word&quot; allow &quot; and the note to question 4 should be omitted.On receiving the form (which we hereinafter refer to as an &quot; appearance &quot;)the Registrar should file it and send an acknowledgment of receipt to theRespondent and send a copy to the Petitioners solicitor. If the Respon-dent in his appearance states that he does not intend to defend, the Peti-tioner should be entitled at once to apply to set down the case for trialwithout waiting another 14 days to see if an answer is filed.Procedure on Entering Appearances40. At present there are two operations to be performed by a personwho enters an appearance. First he has to&apos; ask a clerk of the Registryto make an entry in a book called the Appearance Book. Secondly, he hasto file a memorandum of appearance which is recorded by the clerk.&quot;-in the Court Minutes relating to the case. We are of opinion that twooperations are unnecessary. The second operation alone is sufficient. TheAppearance Book can be abolished with all the time and labour that itinvolves.41. There is at present a considerable divergence in practice about enteringan appearance. If a Respondent enters an appearance in person, he maydo it by post and give any address within the jurisdiction as his addressfor -service. If a solicitor enters an appearance at the Divorce Registry itmust be entered by hand and the address for service must be within 3 milesof the G.P.01., whereas in a District Registry it may be delivered by postand the address for service may be the place where the solicitor carries onbusiness. In the draft form we have enabled all appearances to be madeby post.42. At present if the Petitioner has taken a step in default, the Respondentmust obtain leave to enter an appearance. That is unnecesary. The rulethat is applicable in other Divisions, should apply also to the DivorceDivision, namely, that a Respondent should be able to appear at any timebefore judgment.43. A Respondent should be able if he so wishes to enter an appearancelimited to the prayer for custody or costs Whereas, as the Rule stands atpresent, he cannot do so.  The draft form provides for this.....-     . Leave to Intervene44. At present if a woman named desires to intervene, she must applyfor leave to do so and support her application by an affidavit. This isquite unnecessary. She ought, we think, to be entitled to intervene withoutleave.   The draft form provides for this.;&quot;.&quot;&quot;     . &quot;    &apos;.&apos; Certificate of Xon-Appearance - -45. At present if a Respondent does not enter an . appearance, thePetitioner must request a search to (be made for appearance and file acertificate of non-apipearan f.   This is unnecessary because,&apos; whenever an
14appearance is entered, it is noted in the minutes of the case, and the Courtfan see at once whether or not an appearance has been entered withoutequiring a certificate thereof.Certificate of Service46. At present when an appearance is entered, and even if an answer isfiled, a certificate of service must be filed. This is unnecessary since byentering an appearance the Respondent shows that he has been served.Affidavit of Service47. At present if there is no appearance the Petitioner must, before hecan set down the case for trial, file an affidavit of service. This affidavitshould however be dispensed with where service is by registered post andthe Respondent signs and returns to the Registrar an acknowledgment ofservice.Affidavit of search for Answer48. At present if a Respondent appears but does not file an answer, thePetitioner has to cause a search to be made for answer and make an affidavitthat no answer has been filed. This is also unnecessary because, wheneveran answer is filed it is noted in the minutes of the case. Already in DistrictRegistries an affidavit of search for answer is not required.Amendment49. At present no petition can be amended without leave. Unless other-wise directed, an application for leave to amend has to be supported byaffidavit, and if leave is given the amended petition must be re-served onthe Respondent. This procedure is in many cases unnecessarily expensive.An amendment is often of a formal character and in that case should notinvolve much expense. In our opinion it should be permissible to amendany petition without leave before it is served; for it is the amended petitionthat will then be served. Even after service, the procedure should besufficiently flexible to allow for formal amendments being made simply. Inour opinion, even after service, whether before or after appearance, solong as no answer has been filed, the Petitioner should be at liberty toapply ex parte to the Registrar for leave to amend without filing an affidavitin support. If leave is given, the Registrar should give it on such termsas may be just. If the amendment is such as substantially to alter thenature or particulars of the charge or to introduce for the first time aprayer for discretion, the Registrar would no doubt require the amendedpetition to be re-served, but if the amendment were of a minor character,he should allow it without re-service as judges often do at the trial. Therule should be that no re-service is necessary unless the Court otherwiseorders. In cases where an answer has been filed, the application for leaveto amend should be on notice to the Respondent and if granted should beon such terms as may be just, but there should be no need for an affidavitin support. .   . -  -     .&quot;Answer50. It is desirable that in defended cases there should be an answer,especially as the Respondent often wishes to make a claim for divorceon his own account and the answer is the proper place to make it. But ifour suggestion as to the scope of an appearance is accepted, there will -beno need for an answer to be filed by . the Co-respondent or the woman
named, because the suggested form of appearance will sufficiently define theissues so far as they are concerned. At present the Rules provide that a co^respondent shall not be heard on any question as to damages until he has 111665an answer. This is unnecessary. If he has entered an appearance, and hasgiven due notice on the suggested form, he should be heard on damages with-out filing an answer. In other divisions of the High Court no defence is neces-sary as to damages and we see no reason why the same should not applyin the Divorce Court. It should be permissible to file an answer by post,just as appearances may be entered by post.Affidavit in support of Answer51. In our opinion there is no need for an affidavit in support of an answer.Affidavit in support of Particulars52. In our opinion there is no need for an affidavit in support of particulars.Medical Inspection53. At present, in proceedings for nullity on the ground of incapacityof the Respondent, the Rules of Court provide that two medical inspectorsare to be appointed by the Registrar to examine the parties. In an un-defended case it is often the Petitioner alone who attends. The inspectorsexamine him and make a report for which they may charge up to tenguineas each. At the hearing one of them attends Court to give evidence ifnecessary, and the fee for attendance is up to 5 guineas. The cost to aPetitioner of this medical inspection is therefore heavy.54. No such inspection is necessary in the case of nullity on the groundof wilful refusal to consummate the marriage. The result is that there is afinancial inducement in favour of &apos;&apos; wilful refusal &apos;&apos; when the real casemay be incapacity.55. In our opinion the cost is too high. In order to reduce it, we proposethat, in cases where the Petitioner has already been examined by herown medical adviser, the report of that adviser might suffice unless theCourt should otherwise order; that in any event inspection by one doctorshould suffice unless either party should ask for two; and that the reportof the inspector should be admitted in evidence without the necessity ofcalling him as a witness unless a party or the Court should require hisattendance.Mode of Trial56. At present all cases are heard by a judge alone unless otherwisedirected. In our opinion this provision should remain because the statutoryduty of investigation which is imposed on the Court is as a rule betterperformed by a Judge alone than with a jury. In cases when damagesare claimed, however, the Rules provide that they are to be tried with acommon jury unless otherwise directed. In our opinion there is no goodreason for treating those cases differently from the others.Registrars Certificate57. At present, before a case can be set down for trial, the petitioner hasto apply to the Registrar for his certificate that the pleadings and proceedings-are in order and for directions as to the place of trial or hearing,
*3 - 1458- The duties of the Registrar in this regard are delegated in London tophe clerks in the Registry. Before granting the certificate those clerks areunder a duty to see that everything is exact. The result is that the certificatemay be refused for a minor error. For instance if the name of a co-respondentis not fully given in the petition (e.g. it may omit one of his Christian nameswhich is unknown to the Petitioner) then if the co-respondent enters anappearance giving his full names, the certificate may be refused until thepetition is amended and the supporting affidavit is re-sworn.59. Again, if an allegation of adultery is thought not to be sufficiently par-ticularised, the certificate may be refused unless there is produced the natureof the evidence to be adduced in support of the charge. The clerks are onlycarrying out their duty in accordance with directions given to them, but thesystem is productive of much delay and expense. The solicitor is entitled tosee the Registrar on any point that is raised but the solicitor is often representedonly by a junior clerk who abides by the ruling of the clerks in the Registryinstead of referring it to the Registrar.60. We have come to the conclusion that the disadvantages of delay andexpense caused by the present system of queries on the Registrars Certificateoutweigh any advantages which it has in ensuring accuracy. There is noreason why the clerks in the Registry should see whether the petition complieswith the Rules, for that is the responsibility of the counsel or solicitor whodrafted it. There is no reason why the clerks should ask to see the natureof the evidence, for that is for the Judge at the trial. All that the clerksshould be asked to do is to see whether or not service has been effected,appearance entered or answer filed so as to certify whether or not, according tothe prescribed time table, (the petition is ready to be set down for trial. In ouropinion the certificate should be confined to that purpose, and it is onlynecessary in cases where there is no summons for directions (see para. 66).Affidavit of Venue61. At present, with regard to place of trial, the petitioner has to file withhis application for the Registrars certificate not only a statement as to theprobable length of the case, but also an affidavit of venue showing where theproposed witnesses reside.62. In our opinion there is no need for an affidavit to give that information.A statement by the Petitioners solicitor should suffice.63. Instead of several statements the application for the Registrar&apos;s cer-tificate itself should give all (the information that is desired.Summons for Directions64. At present the place of trial is fixed when the Registrars certificate isissued. This is convenient in undefended cases where no other interlocutorydirections are sought, but in other cases it would be better combined with ageneral application for directions.65. At present if a Petitioner wishes for certain evidence to be taken onaffidavit he has to issue a separate summons before a Judge for the purpose.If he wishes to amend his petition, he has to issue another summons beforea Registrar, and so forth; a separate summons for each interlocutoryapplication and a separate affidavit in support of each. In the otherDivisions of the High Court all such matters are (so far as possible) dealtwith on one summons for directions before a Master. We see no reasonwhy a similar procedure should not be applied to the Divorce Court. Werecommend that, in undefended cases where special directions are sought,and in defended cases, there should be one summons for directions, whichshould be ex parte when no appearance is entered and should be on two cleardays notice when an appearance is entered.     Upon the hearing of the
summons the Registrar may make such orders as are appropriate on thefollowing matters: Place and mode of trial; evidence on affidavit; amendsment of petition; particulars; discovery of documents; when the case may beset down for trial, and so forth.66. In such eases there will be no need for a Registrars Certificate becauseeverything will have been dealt with in the Summons for Directions. Noaffidavit should be used on the Summons except by special order. No listsof witnesses should be required. The Respondent should be at liberty toapply on the summons for any directions that he may wish.Issuing Summonses67. At present when summonses are issued a solicitors clerk has to go toa clerk in the Registry to ascertain the day and hour when it is to be madereturnable, often having to stand in a queue for the purpose. He must thenfill in those details in the summons and go to the end of the queue again untilthe same Registry clerk issues the summons. There is no reason why theRegistry clerk should not on the first occasion fill in the return date and issuethe summons as in the other Division of the High Court.&apos; Judges&apos; and Registrars&apos; Summonses68. At present the Registrars hear summonses in Somerset House. Thisleads to much inconvenience in those cases in which counsel are concernedbecause they are often engaged at the Courts at the same time. There is noreason why Registrars&apos; summonses in which counsel are concerned shouldnot be heard at the Law Courts. There is one Registrar on duty in the Courtsdaily, and he could fit in the summonses with his duties there.69. If accommodation is available it would be convenient if all Registrar&apos;ssummonses were heard at the Law Courts, but there would have to be apractice Registrar always available at Somerset House.70. At present orders made by a Judge or Registrar on summonses inchambers are drawn up by clerks in the Registry. This takes up considerabletime because a restricted staff has to deal with a large number of orders.Orders are often not ready for 7 to 10 days. In the King&apos;s Bench Division,however, the Judge or Master writes a note of his order on the summons,orders are drawn up by the. solicitor and checked by the clerks. If thispractice were adopted in the Divorce Division, it would save much time andwe recommend that the Solicitor having the conduct of a summons shoulddraw up the Order and take into the Registry two copies thereof, one to beplaced on the Court file and the other for sealing and handing out.71. There is so&apos; much work for a judge in chambers dealing with custodyof children and so forth that there should be in the Divorce Division a judgein chambers as there is in the King&apos;s Bench Division, and he should sit inchambers two days a week, or more frequently if necessary. The list shouldbe sub-divided into groups for hearing at different times.Notes of Evidence in Magistrates&apos; Courts.72. In many of the cases that come before the Divorce Court there havebeen previous proceedings in the Magistrates&apos; Courts.73. It would often be of the greatest assistance to the Divorce Court if ithad before it the notes of evidence taken in the Magistrates&apos; Courts. Atpresent there is no specific Rule requiring the clerk to the Justices to supplycopies of his notes, and.although such notes often are supplied there is nofixed charge for them laid down.74. It is desirable, if not essential, that such notes should be obtained beforethe petition is drafted and we recommend that a Rule should be made under
ihe Summary Jurisdiction Acts providing that a copy of the notes should be&quot;btainable as of right on payment of a prescribed fee. A certified copyshould be admissible in evidence without further proof.Notices to Produce75. At present it is a rule of evidence that if a Petitioner seeks to put beforethe Court a copy of a letter which he has written to the Respondent he hasto give the Respondent notice to produce the original.76. A Petitioner often fails to give a notice to produce. This is an embarrass-ment to the Court especially in an undefended case because it is the dutyof the Judge to investigate the facts, and for that purpose it is very desirablethat he should see all the correspondence and not be prevented by the technicalrules of evidence from so doing.77. In the great majority of cases the Respondent does not produce theoriginal even when notice to produce is given and the Court then receivesthe copy in evidence. In such cases the only effect of a notice to produce isto cause extra work and expense. It would be better for the Court to receivethe copy at once in evidence rather than adjourn the case for notice to produceto be given. We recommend therefore that the Court should be at liberty toreceive a copy in evidence; even though notice to produce has not been givenbut leaving the Court free to insist on notice or a subpoena to produce whenit thinks that course desirable.Evidence78. At present the Rules require that witnesses should be examinedviva voce and in open court unless a judge gives leave for evidence onaffidavit. The application for leave has to be made to a judge and must besupported by an affidavit.79. In our opinion there is no reason why the application should be madeto a Judge. A Registrar is entitled by the Rules to give leave during thevacation and there is no reason why he should not also give leave during termtime. In other-divisions of the High Court leave to take evidence on affidavitcan be given by a Master or Registrar and we see no reason why a similarrule should not apply in the Divorce Division. There is no reason for theapplication to be supported by affidavit unless the Court should so require.80. At present the Rules of Court do not appear to recognise the effectof the Evidence Act 1938 which enables the Court in certain cases to admita signed statement in place of an affidavit. The Evidence Act 1938 is ofcourse effective whatever the wording of the Rules.81. In our opinion signed statements should be admitted in evidence withoutleave in the following cases:  (1) Evidence of non-access from officers in charge of service records.(2) Evidence from medical officers in cases where the petition is basedon incurable unsoundness of mind.(3) Evidence of a foreign lawyer to prove the validity of a foreignmarriage (if the Judge should consider such evidence necessary in additionto the presumption of validity).(4) The report of a medical inspector in nullity cases.(5) A Certified copy of the notes of evidence taken by a clerk to thejustices or an official shorthand writer.. ....
(6) A Certified copy of entry in a Register of Births Deaths and Marriagesand the signature of the informant therein should be presumed to be in hillhandwriting unless the contrary is shown.82. Evidence on affidavit should be admitted without leave in the followingcases:  (1) Evidence of a doctor in uncontested nullity suits or uncontested suitsfor dissolution on the grounds of cruelty.(2) Evidence from a clerk or officer of a hotel or boarding house whosimply produces the registration forms or hotel register, identifies the hotelbill and says that the room occupied was a double room: provided thatthe forms, register, or bill, as the case may be, are exhibited to theaffidavit.83. No general rale can be made in other cases. The Courts may be trustedto give leave for affidavit evidence wherever it is proper to do so, as for instancewhere, in order to corroborate a confession of adultery, evidence is soughtfrom neighbours or relatives who are elderly or ill, or from chambermaidsor boarding house keepers who live at a considerable distance.Notice of Setting Down84. At present a Petitioner who sets down a case for trial has to file anotice of trial. The service of such a notice on the other side is necessary,but the filing of it is unnecessary, especially as it is filed before the otherside is served with it.Last Day for Setting Down85. At the present time when a cause is set down for hearing it is put in thenext list for hearing in London or at Assize. There is a last day for setting downfor each term&apos;s list in London and at each Assize. (There is, however, nolast day for setting down for a term&apos;s list service cases proceeding at theDivorce Registry at Ingersoll House, London). The last day for settingdown for a term&apos;s list in London is about 36 days before the first day of term.The last day for setting down for hearing at an Assize is about 28 days beforeCommission Day for that Assize. If it is desired to add to the list a caseset down after the last day for setting down special application has to be madeto the Court.86. The result is that there is always a rush to get cases set down beforethe last day. That means a flood of applications for Registrars Certificatesover a short period with which the staff are not able to deal and consequentcomplaints of delay.87. We recommend that in London there should be a continuous list ofcases set down for hearing and that when a case is set down it should be givena number at the. Divorce Registry, to enable the solicitor to find the caseeasily in the list and to watch for its approach in the day&apos;s list, and thatthere should be no last days for setting down in London. The continuouslist of service cases at Ingersoll House is only in its infancy, but it appearsto be most satisfactory. There is a continuous list of cases in the otherdivisions of the High Court and that also works satisfactorily.88. Our proposals with regard to hearing cases in the provinces shouldenable a continuous list to be kept there.
2?;Day for Hearing1- 89. We have had much evidence of the inconvenience that is caused bythe absence of any fixed days for hearing undefended cases. The numberof persons concerned in one day&apos;s list (petitioners, witnesses, solicitors andcounsel) may run into more than a hundred, and it is very important thatreasonable notice beforehand should be given, if at all possible. Shortnotice means a great number of telephone calls at the last moment and muchinconvenience for many people. At present there are great difficulties in fixingdays for undefended cases. On Assizes the Judges of the King&apos;s BenchDivision have, as their primary duty, to deliver the gaols before they proceeoto other work. In London it is not possible to say much in advance how manyjudges will be available for undefended cases. The difficulties are, howevervless at the Assize towns which are visited by a Judge of the Probate, Divorceand Admiralty Division, or a Divorce Commissioner because he is able tofix his dates in advance, and the difficulties should be less in London whenspecial Divorce Commissioners are appointed.90. In our opinion it is more important that days should be fixed before-hand for undefended cases than for defended cases. Undefended cases shouldbe heard on fixed days. The lists should be fixed if possible 7 days beforethe day of hearing subject only to variation in particular cases for sufficientreason. Each day&apos;s list should be divided into 2 parts, the first part at10.30 a.m. and the second part at 2 p.m. The lists should be fixed accordingto the number of judges that are reasonably seen to be available; and if moreshould happen to be available then they will be free to take defended cases.There is no reason why defended cases should not be dealt with in the sameway as other civil cases in the High Court. Defended cases should take theirturn according to the judges available to try them but we are of opinion thatthey should as far as possible be fixed or that efforts should be made to givethe parties reasonable notice of when they are likely to be heard.91. It is also important that notice of the day fixed should, if possible,be given to all concerned. At present the petitioners solicitors have to watchthe list to see if their case is in the list or not. A respondent who wishesto be heard on custody or the like has no notice of the hearing at all unlesshe or she employs someone specially to watch the lists. We recommend thata system be introduced whereby on setting the case down for trial the peti-tioner&apos;s solicitors hands in two postcards, addressed to the address for ser-vice of the petitioner and of the repondent (if he has appeared) and leavinga space for the date and place of trial. When the day is fixed, the clerks inthe Registry could, by means of a rubber stamp, quickly fill in those detailsand post the cards.92. As a result of our first interim report the delay at this 9tage has beengreatly reduced. Some delay, expense and inconvenience is however stillcaused by the practice whereby it is necessary for a decree absolute to bepronounced in open court. It involves the Divorce Registry in much workin preparing the list and it involves the transmission of documents from Dis-trict Registry to the Divorce Registry and so forth. In cases where noappearance is entered within the 6 weeks, the pronouncement of the decreeabsolute is already an automatic proceeding, and we recommend that thisbe recognised by dispensing with the pronouncement of decree absolute inopen court and enabling the decree absolute to be issued out of the DivorceRegistry, or the District Registry concerned, on application being made atthe end of the 6 weeks provided that no appearance or appeal has beenentered within that time.Delays between Decrees Nisi and Absolute
2r8&quot;. Application for Maintenance  ;93- At present alimony pendente lite ceases automatically&apos;&quot;on decreeabsolute, and the wife may be in grave difficulties because her applicationfor maintenance may not have come on for hearing. We recommend thaton the hearing of an application for alimony pendente lite the Registrarshould have power to fix the maintenance to take effect if and when decreeabsolute is made; or if he does not do this, then he should have power todirect that alimony be continued after decree absolute until maintenance hasbeen fixed. At present a wife must apply for maintenance within one monthof decree absolute. If she does not do so, she cannot thereafter apply formaintenance except by leave of a judge. Many wives do not apply for main-tenance within the month, sometimes because they are earning themselves,and sometimes because there are negotiations between the solicitors. In ouropinion there should be no limit of time for the application specified by rule.It should be judged on its merits, whenever made, leaving the Registrar orJudge to give such weight to lapse of time as he thinks right in the lightof the statute.94. At present in cases where the husband is petitioner and asks for thediscretion of the Court on account of his own adultery, the wife who is alsoguilty has under the statute a right to make a claim for maintenance. Althoughthe decree is in form against her, the conduct of the parties may be such thatthe husband should maintain her. Nevertheless an application by her istreated in practice as being an application for a &quot; compassionate allowance &quot;and, she has to obtain the leave of a Judge before she can make a claim.This practice should be altered. It should be made clear that she has a rightto make a claim. In discretion cases it is often not possible to assess thedegrees of guilt and an application by the wife, whether petitioner or respon-dent, should be treated on the merits of the case, irrespective of the decreebeing in form for or against her.Enforcement of Orders95. At present when the Court orders a co-respondent to pay damages,and sometimes when it orders payment of costs, it directs the money tobe paid into Court. This is unsatisfactory because it does not make the partya debtor and the order cannot be enforced except by attachment. The usualcourse in such cases is to apply by summons to vary the order by direct-ing payment to the petitioner or his solicitor (as the case may be) on hisundertaking to pay the sum into Court when recovered; and invariably theapplication is granted. We recommend that the double step should beeliminated and that the order should in the first place be made to pay themoney to the petitioner, or his solicitor (as the case may be) on his under-taking to pay it into Court in cases where it is considered that the applicationof it should be controlled by the Court: but such an undertaking should notbe required where there is no necessity for the Court to retain control of themoney. It should, not be required when a ^decree nisi is pronouncedwith costs, so long as there is a solicitor&apos;s undertaking to return the costsif the decree nisi is subsequently rescinded.Costs96. On the existing procedure, it is inevitable that costs should be con-siderable. There are so many interlocutory proceedings, affidavits, certifi-cates and so forth that the expenses mount up. The practical way to reduceexpenses is to reduce the number of these interlocutory proceedings, for thatwill save the Court fees and stamp duties and will save the cost of thetime that the solicitors spend on them.
1I 97. Many of our recommendations are direoted to reducing the number of&quot;nterlocutory proceedings, affidavits and certificates, and if they are carriedout they should result in a substantial saving. It is only by reducing theamount of work that the charges can be reduced. As to Court fees, the onlyspecific item which is excessive in itself is the Court fee of  4 10s. od. onsetting down an undefended case for trial. We suggest that this should besubstantially reduced, say to  2. As to solicitors&apos; charges, they will bereduced by reducing the work the solicitors have to do. As to counsel&apos;s fees,we have made a suggestion in paragraph 6 which we hope will result in areduction in many cases.Directions98. At present the procedure of the Court is governed partly by Rulesof Court and partly by Practice Notes or Directions issued from time to time.We have received complaints that these Directions do not receive sufficientpublicity, with the result that a solicitor who goes to file a petition may haveit refused because the clerk points to a Direction posted on a board, withwhich the petition does not comply. It is very desirable that the procedureshould be governed solely by Rules of Court and that existing Directionswhich it is desirable to retain should be embodied in Rules of Court.The Organisation of the Registry99. At present the Registry is housed in quarters in Somerset House whichare inconvenient and too small. We suggest that it should be removed tothe Royal Courts of Justice.100. All forms should be on sale at the Registry at the same prices aselsewhere.Conclusion101. The suggestions we have made in this interim report for reformingprocedure can all be effected by Rules of Court without legislation. The furtherproposals which we have to make will require legislation, and we reserve themuntil our final report.Signed: ;A. T. DENNING. . .BR1DGEMAN.GRACE CALVER.C. A. COLLINGWOOD.N.
