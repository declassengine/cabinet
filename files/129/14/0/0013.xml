THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1946SECRET Copy No.CP   (46) 4131st November, 1946CABINET.SITE OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE ORGANISATIONMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIt is becoming a matter of urgency in connection with the discussions lookingto an International Trade Organisation to formulate our views as regards themost desirable site for such a body. No proposal on this point has so far appearedin documents connected with these discussions, e.g., the United States&quot; Proposals &quot; or the United States draft of a &quot;Charter &quot; for the Organisation.But it is evident that tihe question may be raised during the forthcoming meetingof the Preparatory Committee of the Economic and Social Council of the UnitedNations, and the United Kingdom representatives should be ready with viewson the point.2. It is, of course, necessary to take proper account in considering thisquestion of the location of the United&apos; Nations headquarters themselves. Adefinite decision has been reached that these should be in the United States andpresent indications are that the site will be fairly close to New York City. Therelevant Committee of the United. Nations has been busy producing estimatesof the space required by the United Nations for this purppse and the cost involvedand their estimates have been drawn up on the basis that a number of&quot;specialised agencies,&quot; of which the International Trade Organisation wouldbe one, will be housed with the main organisation itself.3. Mr. Noel-Baker, when Minister of State, was strongly in favour ofhaving, so far as possible, the specialised agencies under one roof, as it were,with the United Nations and acceptance of the site estimates on behalf of theUnited Kingdom sub silentio would be tantamount to the acceptance of this view.Two of the allied bodies, the International Monetary Fund and the InternationalReconstruction Bank, are already provided for, i.e., they are definitely to besited in Washington. (This was on the insistent demand of the United Statesrepresentatives and against our own wishes.) It will thus, in any case, not befeasible to group together the United Nations Organisation itself and all theassociated bodies, and in any case the siting of the International Trade Organisa-tion should be considered on its merits.4. It may also be mentioned that the International Labour Office, whichsince the war has been in Montreal, has not yet reached any decision about itspermanent site. Montreal also houses the Provisional International CivilAviation Organisation, which has taken a decision to locate the headquarters ofthe permanent Organisation there; any further decision on the location is,however, to be the subject of consultation with the United Nations under theterms of the draft Agreement between P.I.C.A.O. and the United Nations. Twoother organisations, the Universal Postal Union and the International Tele-communications Union, are already located in Europe, and, if the policy of theUnited Kingdom in this matter is successful, will remain there. I understandalso that it may possibly be decided to locate the headquarters of the WorldHealth Organisation in Europe.5.   Before the Bank and the Fund decided on Washington, there was muchto be said for a common site for these bodies and the I.T.O.   I think, however,-that it will be generally agreed that Washington would be a most unwelcome[32642]
location for the I.T.0. Next after the Bank and the Fund, it is probable thatthe body to be taken most closely into&apos; account-is the Food and AgricultureOrganisation. &apos; Here again, however, no final decision has been taken as to site.-/&apos;&apos;- 6. As I see it the principal argument for locating the International TradeOrganisation at the headquarters of the United.Nations is that it will be closelyConcerned with the work of the Economic and Social Council and of its variousCommittees, particularly in relation to employment,- economic development,balance of payments questions and statistics; consultation would be facilitatedby a common roof. If, therefore, it were decided by the Food and AgricultureOrganisation to go in Wth the United Nations headquarters, there would be acase for the I.T.O. to do likewise. -.. -7. But I am very doubtful whether an argument commonly used, viz., thatthe location of such bodies in the United States keeps alive the interest of theUnited States public in international matters, and increases their sense of respon-sibility has not been overdone, and there is certainly a body of opinion in theUnited States which is not very enthusiastic for the wholesale adoption of thispolicy. Moreover, there are substantial objections to locating the I.T.O. in theUnited States, whether with the United Nations themselves or not.  These are(a) The general difficulty created by the cost.   The Food and AgricultureOrganisation, for instance, which has provisionally been at Washing-,   \ ton   since   its   inception,   has   found   the   cost   extremely   andembarrassingly high.  I understand that it is likely to be faced beforelong with the choice of raising its subscription rates or curtailing its. activities on this account.   In its relationship agreement with the;. United Nations it has taken the precaution of qualifying its agree-ment to locate itself with the U.N.O. headquarters by the proviso&quot;subject to being situated at a place where it can effectively andeconomically discharge its duties and maintain liaison with thosespecialised agencies with which it is particularly concerned.&quot; Theeffect of having all the associated bodies in the United States will be)- a cumulation of dollar commitments for subscriptions, which we shouldfind burdensome, and some of the smaller countries might find pro-.:. ,    hibitive.   The same difficulty may also have the effect of deterringable men and women from joining the staff of the United Nations,; especially as the cost of living in the United States may well notyet have reached its peak,(ft) Man-power has to be considered in connection with the present andincreasing multiplicity of international meetings.   It is unreasonablethat United Kingdom officials should have to be spared in suchnumbers and with such frequency for visits to the United States. Any&quot; relief to be derived from the location of some of the bodies in questionnearer home would be most welcome.&apos; (c) There may well be some political advantage in the distribution of bodiesworking under the United Nations umbrella; in other words theargument in favour of having such bodies in the United States may; &quot; - apply to other countries and may point to sharing such an incentiveto maintained interest.id) Do we wish to encourage the growth of a sort of rarefiedv atmospherearound these bodies and around the severely practical matters withwhich they should be dealing by creating a vast international settle-ment, remote from ordinary life, comprising a very large number ofinternational Civil Servants, living in a sort of reservation in ratherunreal though probably extremely expensive conditions? It is truethat such a settlement could not come into being with adequate hotelaccommodation for a number of years, but we do not, I feel, wish tocommit ourselves to such a prospect, especially as in the transitionalperiod conditions are unlikely to be conducive even to administrativeefficiency.!V    8.   On the whole, therefore, my. conclusion is that we should be careful not Ito get committed to the location of the International Trade Organisation with!the headquarters of the United Nations or indeed to its location anywhere in theUnited States.   I am myself inclined to favour a European site for the Food!and Agriculture Organisation, and I understand that the Minister of Food andl
the Minister of Agriculture are strongly of that opinion. Accordingly, I suggestthat we should propose this and watch how the matter develops in that direction-meanwhile keeping the site of the Trade Organisation open. It may be thatGeneva would suffer from some of the same disadvantages as a new UnitedNations city in the United States, but there are, of course, already entirelysuitable buildings there with ample hotel accommodation. At any rate, I feelrather strongly that we should get both these bodies this side of the Atlantic, andI hope that my colleagues will agree that our representatives at any internationalgathering should take this line and see that the position is kept open.V ,      :v     ., &apos; &apos;    .&apos; R.
