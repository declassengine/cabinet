(46) 6 andH.P.C. (46) 91)&amp;h November, 1946CABINETTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING BILLMemorandum by Minister oe Town and Country PlanningI circulate herewith a draft of the above Bill, revised in accordance with theiecisions taken by the Cabinet on 1st August, 1946 * A detailed note of itsprovisions is given in Appendix A; in summary form the effect is as follows : Part I establishes a Land Commission and transfers planning functions fromthe District Councils to the County Councils.Part II repeals the inadequate planning system at present on the StatuteBook  (which was incompatible with the compensation-bettermentproposals) and sets up an improved planning system more suited topresent conditions and requirements.   The Bill therefore becomes themain planning instrument for the future, and I propose to alter thetitle from Town and Country Planning (Development Rights) Bill toTown and Country Planning Bill.   The Bill is not framed in termsof the &apos;&apos; nationalisation of development rights.&apos;&quot;&apos;   It merely providesthat land can be kept restricted to its present use; that it can bebought compulsorily at &quot; existing use &quot; value instead of, as atpresent, at a &quot; development value &quot; that is often inflated; that if per-mission to develop is granted the increased value resulting from suchpermission shall be collected for public funds; and it provides underPart IV for immediate compensation to landowners for the conse-quential loss of the development value of their land.Part III provides the positive power for buying compulsorily any landneeded to carry planning proposals into effect.   In particular, itenables the plan to designate land required for a ten years&apos; buildingprogramme, and, once the plan is settled, after full enquiry, it enablescompulsory purchase to take place without having to entertainobjections to the plan all over again.Part IV provides for compensation to landowners (on the &quot; discount &quot; basisapproved by the Cabinet)  for depriving them of  &apos;&apos; developmentvalues.&quot;Part V sets up the powers and machinery for imposing a &quot;development(i.e., betterment) charge &quot; on all future permissions to develop land.It thus enables future increases in land value on change of use tobe collected for public funds.Part VI deals with the application of the Bill to certain special classes ofcase, some of them purely transitional.Part VII covers supplemental points, the most important of which is theExchequer grant to local authorities towards any losses they incurin carrying planning proposals into effect.i number of drafting points have still to be settled with other Departments and!&apos;iew additional clauses may be necessary on minor matters.   I am arranging* CM. (46) 76th Conclusions, Minute 2.[32762] B
for these to be dealt with before introduction in the House in December; butin view of pressure of time I am circulating the draft in its present form inorder to draw attention to a number of points which my colleagues will wish toconsider.(1) Compensation for Loss of Development Values2. (a) Land purchased since 1919. Clauses 50-58 of the Bill provide forcompensation on the &quot; discount basis &quot; approved by Cabinet. The following arethe main points of detail to which I should draw attention :- (i) The basis of valuation is prices current at the date of introductionof the Bill and not the 1939 valuation. This avoids arguments(which would have to be resisted) on whether a percentage supple-ment should be added to take account of changed money values.(ii) The amount of compensation will be determined by discounting at 5 peicent, compound interest from the appointed day back to the date ofthe purchase, with a backward limit of 31st December, 1918.To give a broad picture, the effect will be as follows : Purchase in 1948,, 1939,, 1932,, 1925,, 1919,, before 1919compensation payment 100 per cent.67 ,,48j) 34 ,, ,,25 ,, ,,Nil.(iii) Compensation will be excluded altogether unless the purchase was&quot;purchase for value,&quot;   This will exclude gifts from compensationbut will not exclude transactions for partial consideration.(iv) Where land is purchased after the date of introduction of the Bill nocompensation will be paid by reference to that purchase, but thepurchaser will be allowed to &apos;&apos; stand in the shoes &apos;&apos; of the personfrom whom he purchased. This prevents owners entering into trans-actions purely for the purpose of securing higher compensation. Atthe same time it avoids penalising legitimate transactions and avoidsa complete stoppage of land sales in the period during which the Billis before Parliament.(b) Compensation for inherited land. *As a result of discussions between myDepartment, the Treasury, and the Board of Inland Revenue, I have reached theconclusion that it would be contrary to the general principle of the Bill to domore than provide a formula that, broadly, secures repayment of any death dutieswhich the present owner in fact paid in respect of development value. A straight-forward adjustment of actual duties paid is not practicable owing to the valuationdifficulties and Clause 53 of the Bill therefore applies the main discount formulabut limits the actual payment to a percentage corresponding to the effective rateof death duty paid.(c) Minerals. This clause is left blank in the circulated print of the Bill,but I hope to be able to circulate a draft in the course of a few days. Theoriginal proposal was to exempt &quot; existing workings &quot; from compensation andbetterment but it has been found impossible to frame a satisfactory definition of&apos;unit on an area basis. I propose therefore to adopt a &quot; time &quot; basis and leave imineral working for three years to be free of development charge, and thereafterto secure that royalty owners are placed in no better position for compensationpurposes than landowners generally.(d) Method of payment. -Clauses 59-62 provide for the satisfaction ofcompensation by the issue of compensation stock within five years.(e) Estimate of cost.-A precise estimate of cost is not possible because of lackof statistical information on many matters, but the best indication possible isgiven in Appendix B. The compensation under Part IV will be, it is thought,of the order of  400,000,000.(2) Transfer of Planning Functions to County Councils3. The Bill transfers planning functions from the District Councils to theCounty Councils but provides in the First Schedule for the preparation by eachCounty Council of a scheme of administration under which the District Councilscan be associated with the planning of their areas through the setting up oi
area sub-committees on which they are represented and to which selected functionscan be delegated. This will provide a flexible machine that can be adapted to the .needs of a particular area, and, while leaving the main tasks with the CountyCouncil, will enable the knowledge and experience which the District Councilshave of their areas to be drawn upon. The Associations representing the DistrictCouncils have expressed strong opposition to the proposal to transfer planningpowers to the County Councils, but they accept the view that the main outlineplan for the area cannot be prepared on a district basis, and the above proposals,by making sure that they are brought fully into the picture, will go some waytowards overcoming their opposition.4. I propose a similar provision for London with slight adaptation to enablethe City to play its appropriate part in the planning of the area. The relation-ship between the L.C.C. and the Metropolitan Boroughs will remain substantiallyunchanged.(3) Compulsory Purchase of Land5. I attach great importance to Part III of the Bill because compulsorypurchase of land will be the main instrument for ensuring that a plan is carriedinto effect. In particular, although the. plans prepared under the Bill mustaecessarily be long-term in their broad concept, I am anxious that they shouldat the same time be severely practical documents and to that end should indicatea reasonably firm programme of development and redevelopment for a period often years or so ahead. The plans will be reviewed from time to time, and theprogramme of development modified or extended as may be necessary. Theplanning of our land resources will thus take its place in any wider operations^that may be necessary from time to time for securing full use of our availableresources of material and man-power.6. I also draw particular attention to the fact that Clauses 35 and 45 of theBill enable land required for any Government or statutory purposes to be reservedin the plans and, if likely to be wanted within ten years or so, to be designatedfor compulsory purchase. This will enable the County Plan to be prepared withproper regard for these national and other important requirements,, and anyobjections to the proposals can be considered and disposed of before the plan isapproved. Thereafter the Departments concerned will be able to purchase theland with the minimum, of trouble and delay and usually without further localinquiry into the merits Of the particular project. I have also extended generallythe &quot; streamlined&quot; procedure of the Acquisition of Land (AuthorisationProcedure) Act, 1946.7. This designation is entirely optional, and, although I invite my colleaguesto co-operate in the planning process to the fullest possible extent, it does notinterfere in any way with their existing powers and procedure for the purchaseof land. Nor. where land is designated, does it remove from them the responsibilityof making or approving the compulsory purchase orders. It is merely aimed atsimplifying the procedure and at the same time securing comprehensiveconsideration of the land to be selected for particular purposes.(4) 1939 Standard8. Apart from minor alterations in Clauses 47-49 to remedy defects inexisting law, the Bill leaves the compensation to be paid on compulsory purchase-related to the 1939 standard, reduced, of course, to &quot; existing use &quot; value. Iunderstand, however, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has the question ofthe 1939 standard under review, and I hope it will be possible to take an earlydecision on policy so that I may be able to meet criticism or opposition when theBill is before Parliament.(5) Exchequer Grants9. In agreement with the Chancellor, Clauses 88-90 of the Bill provide forExchequer assistance to.local authorities in connection with a much wider rangeof planning expenditure, viz. : (i) Blitz, i.e., cost of redeveloping areas of extensive war damage.(ii) Blight, i.e., cost of redeveloping areas of bad layout or obsoletedevelopment.(iii) Derelict land, i.e., cost of bringing land into a condition in which itcan be brought back into use.[32762] b 2
(iv) Compensation incurred in discharging planning functions underPart II.(v) Losses incurred, for planning reasons, in the acquisition of land andits diversion to a less valuable use.The details of these grants will be settled by regulation, but I draw particularattention to Clause 88 (4) (d) which enables provision to be made for &apos;: weighting&quot;the grant by reference to the financial capacity of the particular authority andthe size of the financial burden imposed on it by the requirements of redevelop-ment and other planning operations.10. In redevelopment schemes grant will take the form of a percentagecontribution to loan charges over a 60-year period. The maximum percentagesprescribed in the Bill are 90 per cent, for blitz and 80 per cent, for blight anddereliction : in fact I propose that these maxima for blitz, blight and derelictionshould come down to 70 per cent, in the second quinquennium and 60 per cent,thereafter. For the other planning grants the Bill prescribes a maximum of60 per cent, from the outset.11. The minima, and the method of scaling the grants to meet the circum-stances of the different authorities, will be prescribed by regulations and are stillunder discussion with the Treasury.(6) Control of Advertisements12. The Bill enables complete control of outdoor advertisements to beinstituted, and provides no compensation to landowners who are required onpublic grounds to discontinue the use of their land or buildings for hoardingsor other advertising purposes. This exclusion of compensation is likely to bechallenged, but it follows the precedent of existing law, including a number ofLocal Acts. A number of advertising uses which do not materially affect landvalues will be exempted from development charge by Regulations, but I do notpropose to extend this exemption to landowners who secure a substantially higherrental through letting land for hoardings and other similar purposes.(7) Land Commission13. The Minister of Agriculture is anxious to avoid any confusion betweenthe Land Commission set up by this Bill and the Agricultural Land Commissionwhich he proposes to establish by legislation this Session. For my own partI see no strong objection to the two titles as proposed; but if my colleaguesconsider some modification is necessary, I suggest that -(a) the body to be appointed under this Bill might be called the CentralLand Board; and(&amp;) the body to be appointed under the Minister of Agriculture^ Bill mightbe called the Agricultural Commission, thus corresponding to other&quot; functional &quot; commissions (e.g., for Forestry, Electricity, transport.&amp;c).14. I also draw attention to Clause 41 which enables the Land Commissionto buy land compulsorily in certain circumstances. This is partly to enable themto sell in a free market in order to provide a periodic oheck on the administrationof development charges and partly to provide a simple machinery by which landreserved in a plan for development by private enterprise can be made availableat a comprehensive price, without necessarily putting the developer to the troubleof negotiating separately with the landowner and the Land Commission. Severalof my colleagues pressed for a procedure on these lines in earlier discussion.(8) General15. This Bill will arouse strong opposition, particularly from landedinterests. It is, however, vital for the establishment of a successful system ofplanned development, including the essential task of rebuilding towns and citieson modern lines.16. I ask therefore that the Legislation Committee be invited to considerthe Bill, subject to minor modifications or additions on a few matters that arestill under discussion with other Departments and on which I do not expectthat any difficulty or major point of policy will arise.
17 I propose, if my colleagues agree, to issue with the Bill an explanatoryWhite. Baper. I am aiming at introducing the Bill before Christmalvwith-aview to Second Reading in January. A separate Bill will be prepared by theSecretary of State for Scotland, as directed by the Legislation Committee. *L. S.Ministry of Town and Country Planning.&apos;  25th November, 1946.APPENDIX ASUMMARY OF PROVISIONS OF THE TOWN AND COUNTRYPLANNING BILLPart I. Central and Local Administration1. Land Commission. Clauses 2-3 enable a Land Commission to beappointed to administer the compensation and betterment provisions. There willbe one Commission for England and Wales and Scotland, appointed jointly bythe Minister of Town and Country Planning and the Secretary of State.2. Local Planning Authorities. Clause 4 places planning functions on thecouncils of counties and county boroughs, and Part I of the First Schedule enablesJoint Planning Boards to be set up for securing comprehensive treatment ofparticular &apos;&apos; planning units &apos;&apos; covering parts of the areas of two or more planningauthorities. Provision is also made in the Schedule for the establishment ofBegional Advisory Committees for the purpose of securing co-ordinated planningover wider areas. Part III of the First Schedule imposes on the County Councilsthe obligation of setting up area sub-committees on which the District Councilsin the area will have representation and to which selected functions can bedelegated.Part II. Planning and Control of Development3. Development Plans. Clause 5 requires Local Planning Authorities,within three years, to make a survey of their areas and prepare a DevelopmentPlan showing how they propose that the land in their area should be used., andspecifying the land likely to be wanted for various purposes within a ten-yearperiod. Provision is made for a review of the Plan at least every five years.Clause 6 provides a default Power under which the Minister can himself makeor amend a plan for any area or authorise another local planning authority todo so and recover the cost from the defaulting authority.4. Permission to Develop Land. Clause 9 provides that permission is to berequired for any development of land, except certain defined classes of develop-raent over which planning control is unnecessary. Development is defined as thecarrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on, under,or over land and the making of any material change in the use of any buildingsor other land. Clauses 10-15 enable the detailed machinery for the grantingof permissions to be prescribed by Regulations; provide for an appeal to theMinister, in certain cases, if an applicant is aggrieved by the decision of theLocal Authority; and also enable the Minister to call in certain applications fordecision by the Government instead of the local planning authority.Clause 16 provides that where land has become incapable of reasonablybeneficial use and planning permission to develop is refused, the owner canrequire the District Council or County Borough to buy the land from him.Clause 17 provides for the payment of compensation to an owner who isrefused permission for certain classes of development specified in paragraphs2-6 of the Third Schedule, being classes which, for compensation purposes, areregarded as&apos;within the range of &quot; existing use.&quot; By the Fourth Schedule thiscompensation is related to the 1939 standard of values.Clause 19 provides for payment by the Local Planning Authority of com-pensation for any expenditure rendered abortive by the revocation or modifica-hon of a planning permission.5. Enforcement of Planning Control. If any development is carried outWithout permission, or contrary to the terms of any permission, Clauses 20 and* H.P.C. (46) 23rd Meeting, Minute 1.
21 give the local planning authority and the Minister power, so far as may benecessary on planning grounds, to secure restoration of the land to its formercondition, or compliance with the permission, as the case may be.Clauses 22-23 give the local planning authority power, on payment ofcompensation, to require discontinuance of any existing use or demolition ofany existing building if necessary on planning- grounds. Compensation is assessedon the basis of the 1939 standard.. Owners have a right of appeal to the Ministerand if, as a result of any such order, the land is incapable of reasonably beneficialuse, they may require the local planning authority to buy the land.6. Trees and Woodlands. Clause 24 re-enacts the provisions in the existingplanning Acts for securing the preservation on amenity grounds of trees andwoodlands. Arrangements will be made with the Forestry Commission to avoidoverlap with.the forthcoming Forestry Bill. The clause leaves the question ofcompensation to be settled by the preservation order, in the light of particularcircumstances of the case. In the normal case the effect of the order will notbe to prohibit all felling of trees, but merely be to impose control over the timing,with conditions for replanting where necessary, so as to avoid destroying thecharacter of a woodland as such.7. Historic Buildings. Clause 25 similarly re-enacts the provisions in theexisting planning Acts for the preservation of buildings of special architecturalor historic interest.8. Outdoor Advertisements. Clauses 27-28 enable comprehensive Begula-tions to be made for the control of outdoor advertisements, repeal the existingbye-law-making powers, and enable existing local Acts dealing with the subjectto be repealed, where necessary, by Order in Council. A national code ofadvertisement control, within the broad framework of the planning system, willthus be established.9. Waste Land. Clause 29 reproduces a power which has usually been,taken in statutory planning schemes under existing law for enabling the localauthority to take action where waste land has become an eyesore to the area.The clause leaves this entirely in local hands; no appeal to the Minister isprovided.10. Statutory Undertakers. Clause 30 applies to operational land ofstatutory undertakers, in relation to planning operations under the Bill, theprotection given to them by the Town and Country Planning Act, 1944, viz. :-(a) a special basis of compensation in certain cases specified in the FifthSchedule,(&amp;) Parliamentary procedure before compulsory purchase of their land, ifthey raise objections.The provisions of the 1944 Act have, however, been amended, as a result ofexperience in the operation of the Act, to enable compensation to be excludedin certain cases (proviso to paragraph 1.(3) of the Fifth Schedule). The proviso,is in square brackets as the point is still under discussion.11. Development by Local Planning Authorities. Clause 31 re-enactsSection 32 of the 1944 Act, under which development by local planning authoritiesthemselves can be brought under Ministerial control, where necessary, as in thecase of other development.12. Existing Local Act Powers.--The purpose of Clause 32 is to make itclear that development authorised by other Acts, including local Acts, but notyet carried out, is within the main planning machinery and within the scopeof the development charge; and that the land is subject to the general compensa-tion provisions of Part IV.13. Default powers of the Minister. Clause 33 enables the Minister to takeaction in certain cases if the local planning authority fail to do so. The clauseprovides fresh default powers in relation to interference with existing buildingsand uses, and the preservation of trees and historic buildings; it extends existingpowers in relation to enforcement of planning control; and re-enacts the existingpowers in relation to revocation of planning permission.14. Pre-Plan stage. Clause 34 provides for the administration of theplanning system in the period before plans are prepared under Clause 5. Theseplans, when prepared, will form the policy basis for both central and locai
administration, but the clause provides that the administration in the pre-planstage is to be based generally on what is required to secure the proper developmentof the area.Part III. -Acquisition of Land15. Designation and Compulsory Acquisition. Under Clause 5, a develop-ment plan may designate, as subject to compulsory purchase in order to carryout a Plan, land likely to be wanted within a period of ten years or so fromthe date of the first approval, or subsequent modification of a Plan.Where the land is designated for the purpose of a Minister, or for a localauthority or statutory undertaker function for which powers of purchase alreadyexist, the Minister who requires the land, or the Minister concerned with the localauthority or statutory undertaker function, as the case may be, is enabled byClause 35 to purchase, or authorise the purchase, in the ordinary way, but hecan if he wishes adopt the &quot; streamlined &quot; procedure of the Acquisition of Land(Authorisation Procedure) Act, 1946, (including the &quot;speedy procedure&quot;) andcan disregard any objections which amount in substance to saying that the planalready settled, after full inquiry, was wrong.It will be noted that Section 35 (2) also gives compulsory powers of purchaseto the Minister of Works and the Postmaster-General in the pre-plan stage,before designation.Clause 36 provides power for the Minister of Town and Country Planningto authorise the purchase of land to carry out a Plan, in cases where no powersof compulsory purchase exist under other Acts or where the purpose is not solelywithin Clause 35. Examples are areas of comprehensive development orredevelopment, land reserved by a. Plan for special purposes such as churches,universities, cinemas, and land reserved for other specific development, such asfactories or private housing, if it cannot be secured otherwise than by compulsion.The procedure of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1944, is repealed andreplaced by that of the new Authorisation Procedure Act, 1946. The &quot; speedyprocedure&apos;&apos; of Section 2 of that Act is however excluded for Clauses 36 purposesand instead the &quot; expedited completion &quot;procedure of the 1944 Act is re-enacted.This is imperative if the purchase is in order to re-convey to a private developer,because it enables a clean title to the land to be given and thus avoids the delay thatmight result if it were necessary to investigate and prove title before work couldbegin. The procedure is particularly important in reconstruction areas wherea multiplicity of interests is involved.Clause 39 re-enacts the 1944 provision enabling buildings of historic, &amp;e,interest to be bought for the purpose of proper maintenance and preservation.Clause 40 provides for appropriation of certain land already in a localauthority&apos;s ownership.Clause 41 enables the Land Commission to buy in certain cases mainly toenable a comprehensive rent or price to be quoted, or where for other reasons itappears unnecessarily complicated to authorise or require a local authority to buymerely for the purpose of handing over to some other person.Clause 42 attracts sections 19-30 of the 1944 Act, which provide a code forenabling local authorities who acquire land for general planning purposes todispose of it in accordance with ministerial, directions, to develop themselves(with the Ministers consent) for purposes outside their normal statutory range,and otherwise to manage the land. Section 20 (3) of the 1944 Act, which pre-vented a local authority from carrying out development if any other person waswilling to do so, is repealed.16. Compensation for Compulsory Purchase. Clause 46 (1) secures tJhaton all future compulsory purchases of land the compensation payable is limitedto &quot; existing-use &quot; value, based on the assumption of a right in perpetuity tocontinue the existing use and to rebuild the existing buildings to the same size(with a tolerance of 10 per cent.).Clause 46 (2) adapts the 1939 standard (which is the present basis ofcompensation) by providing, in effect, that the property to be valued on the 1939standard is the property restricted to existing use and does not include the1939 development value.Clause 46 (3) excludes from compensation (with some exceptions) any elementof value attributable to a building which the owner has claimed is of no beneficialllse and which, in consequence, he has required the local authority to buy.Clause 46 (4) modifies the Eighth Schedule of the 1944 Act (which providesWat compensation on compulsory purchase should be the 1939 &quot; after damage &quot;
value as certified for the war damage value payment) in order to reduce thatvalue to &apos;&apos; existing use &apos;&apos; value.Clauses 47-48 correct two small defects in the &quot; 1939 standard &quot; sectionsof the 1944 Act.Clause 49 enables statutory undertakers to purchase land they require atexisting use value and on. the 1939 standard; this is necessary in order tosafeguard the collection of the development charge on such land.Part IV. Compensation17. Compensation on land purchased since 1918.--The compensation underthis part is the compensation for having, by the combined effect of the Bill,deprived owners of the &quot;development values&quot; of their land. Clauses 50-52give effect to the &quot; discount formula &quot; approved by Cabinet. The amount payableis arrived at by first assessing the difference between the &quot; unrestricted value&quot;and the &quot; restricted value,&quot; then discounting that amount back at 5 per cent,per annum (compound) to the date on which the owner purchased his interest.If the development value could only have been realised by the owner at theexpense of sacrificing the value of some other land an appropriate deduction ismade under subsections (3) and (4) of clause 51.No provision is made for any compensation to owners who purchased landbefore 1918 or who derived their land by way of gift.18.   Inherited Land. Compensation for inherited land is calculated under1clause 53 by applying to the discounted development value arrived at as above,the percentage rate of death duties actually paid by the owner.   Thus, if theproperty was inherited in 1936, the calculation would be : Current development value =  1,000.Discounted for ten years = (say)  616.Value in 1936 =  500.Total duty paid by owner = (say)  40.Effective rate = 8 per cent.Compensation (viz., 8 per cent, of  616) =  76.This clause is in square brackets in accordance with Ministers&apos; directions.*19. Improvements. Where, since the purchase or inheritance, an ownerhas carried out improvements at his own expense which have increased thedevelopment value of the land, clause 54 secures that the compensation for thoseimprovements (either the value or cost, whichever is the less) should be paidat 100 per cent., no discount factor being applied.20. Merged interests. Clause 55 provides machinery for apportionmentwhere two or more interests in the land were acquired at different dates.21. Purchases after introduction of Bill. Clause 56 preserves the positionof vendors and purchasers after the publication of the Bill. It enables thepurchaser to &quot; stand in the shoes &quot; of the vendor and thus claim the same coin-pensation as if the sale had not taken place. Alternatively, it is open to theparties to arrange for the right to compensation to be transferred back to thevendor.22. War Damaged Land. Clause 57 enables an additional payment to bemade in cases where a value payment under the War Damage Act was lower,because of the development value of the land, than it would, otherwise have been.!It aims at securing parity of treatment between an owner whose land was?damaged and an owner of similar property who suffered no damage.23.   Exclusion of small claims. ^Clause 58 excludes claims which are- J(a) less than  5, or(b) based on a development value of  20 per acre or less;(c) based on a development value of not more than one-tenth of therestricted value.24. Issue of Compensation Stock. Clauses 59-62 provide for the issue offstock in satisfaction of compensation not later than five years after the appointed^day on which the Act is brought into operation. Interest accrues as from thejappointed day.
Provision is made by clause 61 for setting off the compensation due to anyperson against any development charge payable by that person before the datefixed for the issue of the stock.25. This part of the Bill provides for the payment to the Land Commissionof such development charge as they may require in respect of any developmentcarried out after the appointed day. Development within &apos;&apos; existing use 1&apos; andthe making good of war damage are given statutory exemption. Other exemptionsmay be provided for from time to time by regulations. (Many of these clauses aremachinery provisions only, and the drafting of this Part of the Bill is underreview.  The salient features are set out in the following paragraphs).26. Amount of Charge. No precise formula is provided, but by clause 66 (3)the Commission are required to have regard to any increase in the value of landby reason of the carrying out of the operations, &amp;o, for which planning permissionhas been granted, and clause 66 (4) enables the Minister, with the consent of theTreasury, to prescribe general principles to be followed by the Commission indetermining the charge.27. AppeaL- No provision is made for any appeal against the chargeimposed by the Commission.28. Penalty. Clause 70 enables the Commission to impose the chargeretrospectively on any development carried out without payment, and enables anamount not exceeding double the amount so imposed to be recovered in the Courtsby way of penalty.29. Prevention of speculation. In order to safeguard against speculationin land scheduled for development, clause 66 enables the Commission to refuse todetermine the charge unless they are satisfied that the applicant intends himselfto carry out the development within a reasonable period; and clause 68 (4) enablesthe charge to be re-assessed if the land is disposed of before the development takesplace.30. This part of the Bill deals with a number of special cases for whichthe general machinery needs to be adapted or modified. Many of them are ofa purely transitional nature.31. Existing contraventions. Clause 73 extends the principle of theBuilding Restrictions (War-Time Contraventions) Act, 1946, to otherbuildings, &amp;o, erected in contravention of planning law, which, if they are outof conformity with planning requirements, can be demolished without compensa-tion. Broadly, the effect over the whole field is that the local planning authorityare required to make up their minds within three years after the appointed daywhether they intend to take action against any such contraventions. If they do,the compensation under Part IV is calculated with full regard to any suchaction; if they do not, the building is automatically sanctioned and thereaftercan only be removed on payment of full compensation.32. Existing conditions. Clause 74 preserves the effect of any conditionswhich have been imposed, under existing law, and preserves the power to enforceMiy such conditions.   .33. Existing consents. Clause 75 preserves all planning permissions givenunder the existing Planning Acts since 22nd July, 1943 (the date of the passingof the Town and Country Planning (Interim Development) Act, 1943, whichapplied planning control to the whole country) as if they were consents underPart II of the Bill. This only applies if the permission has not been acted on;!- it has, the question does not arise.Development in accordance with these consents, if carried out after theappointed day, is, however, within the scope of the development charge, anddispensation under Part IV is related to the physical condition of the land atfte appointed day.34. Unfinished Buildings. Where buildings are in course of erection atfoe appointed day, clause 76 enables them to be completed without payment ofdevelopment charge. Compensation under Part IV is then assessed on theassumption that they were complete at the appointed day.Part V Development ChargesPart VI Application to Special Cases[32762]c
value as certified for the war damage value payment) in order to reduce thatvalue to &apos;&apos; existing use &apos;&apos; value.Clauses 47-48 correct two small defects in the &quot; 1939 standard &quot; sectionsof the 1944 Act.Clause 49 enables statutory undertakers to purchase land they require atexisting use value and on the 1939 standard; this is necessary in order tosafeguard the collection of the development charge on such land.Part IV. Compensation17. Compensation on land purchased since 1918. The compensation underthis part is the compensation for having, by the combined effect of the Bill,deprived owners of the &quot; development values&quot; of their land. Clauses 50-52give effect to the &quot; discount formula &quot; approved by Cabinet. The amount payableis arrived at by first assessing the difference between the &quot; unrestricted value&quot;and the &quot; restricted value,&quot; then discounting that amount back at 5 per cent,per annum (compound) to the date on which the owner purchased his interest.If the development value could only have been realised by the owner at theexpense of sacrificing the value of some other land an appropriate deduction ismade under subsections (3) and (4) of clause 51.No provision is made for any compensation to owners who purchased landbefore 1918 or who derived their land by way of gift.18. Inherited Land. Compensation for inherited land is calculated underclause 53 by applying to the discounted development value arrived at as above,the percentage rate of death duties actually paid by the owner. Thus, if theproperty was inherited in 1936, the calculation would be : Current development value =  1,000. -Discounted for ten years = (say)  616.&apos;      Value in 1936 ^  500.Total duty paid by owner ^ (say)  40.Effective rate = 8 per cent.Compensation (viz., 8 per cent, of  616) =  76.This clause is in square brackets in accordance with Ministers&apos; directions.*19. Improvements. Where, since the purchase or inheritance, an ownerhas carried out improvements at his own expense which have increased thedevelopment value of the land, clause 54 secures that the compensation for thoseimprovements (either the value or cost, whichever is the less) should be paidat 100 per cent., no discount factor being applied.20.   Merged interests. Clause 55 provides machinery for apportionmentwhere two or more interests in the land were acquired at different dates.21. Purchases after introduction of Bill. Clause 56 preserves the positionof vendors and purchasers after the publication of the Bill. It enables the ipurchaser to &apos;&apos; stand in the shoes &apos;&apos; of the vendor and thus claim the same com-pensation as if the sale had not taken place. Alternatively, it is open to theparties to arrange for the right to compensation to be transferred back to thevendor.22.   War Damaged Land. Clause 57 enables an additional payment to bemade in cases where a value payment under the War Damage Act was lower,because of the development value of the land, than it would otherwise have been.It aims at securing parity of treatment between an owner whose land wasjdamaged and an owner of similar property who suffered no damage.23.   Exclusion of small claims. ^Clause 58 excludes claims which are- I(a) less than  5, or(&amp;) based on a development value of  20 per acre or less;(c) based on a development value of not more than one-tenth of the!restricted value.24. Issue of Compensation Stock. Clauses 59-62 provide for the issue offstock in satisfaction of compensation not later than five years after the appointed!day on which the Act is brought into operation. Interest accrues as from the!appointed day.
Provision is made by clause 61 for setting off the compensation due to anyperson against any development charge payable by that person before the datefixed for the issue of the stock..     Part V Development Charges25. This part of the Bill provides for the payment to the Land Commissionof such development charge as they may require in respect of any developmentcarried out after the appointed day. Development within &quot;existing use &quot; andthe making good of war damage are given statutory exemption. Other exemptionsmay be provided for from time to time by regulations. (Many of these clauses aremachinery provisions only, and the drafting of this Part of the Bill is underreview.  The salient features are set out in the following paragraphs).26. Amount of Charge. No precise formula is provided, but by clause 66 (3)the Commission are required to have regard to any increase in the value of landby reason of the carrying out of the operations, &amp;c, for which planning permissionhas been granted, and clause 66 (4) enables the Minister, with the consent of theTreasury, to prescribe general principles to be followed by the Commission indetermining the charge.27. Appeal. No provision is made for any appeal against the chargeimposed by the Commission.28. Penalty. Clause 70 enables the Commission to impose the chargeretrospectively on any development carried out without payment, and enables anamount not exceeding double the amount so imposed to be recovered in the Courtsby way of penalty.29. Prevention of speculation. In order to safeguard against speculationin land scheduled for development, clause 66 enables the Commission to refuse todetermine the charge unless they are satisfied that the applicant intends himselfto carry out the development within a reasonable period; and clause 68 (4) enablesthe charge to be re-assessed if the land is disposed of before the development takesplace.Part VI Application to Special Cases30. This part of the Bill deals with a number of special cases for whichthe general machinery needs to be adapted or modified. Many of them are ofa purely transitional nature.31. Existing contraventions. Clause 73 extends the principle of theBuilding Restrictions (War-Time Contraventions) Act, 1946, to otherbuildings, &amp;c, erected in contravention of planning law, which, if they are outof conformity with planning requirements, can be demolished without compensa-tion. Broadly, the effect over the whole field is that the local planning authorityare required to make up their minds within three years after the appointed daywhether they intend to take action against any such contraventions. If they do,the compensation under Part IV is calculated with full regard to any suchaction; if they do not, the building is automatically sanctioned and thereaftercan only be removed on payment of full compensation.32. Existing conditions. Clause 74 preserves the effect of any conditionswhich have been imposed, under existing law, and preserves the power to enforceany such conditions.   ,33. Existing consents. Clause 75 preserves all planning permissions givenunder the existing Planning Acts since 22nd July, 1943 (the date of the passingof the Town and Country Planning (Interim Development) Act, 1943, whichapplied planning control to the whole country) as if they were consents underPart H of the Bill. This only applies if the permission has not been acted on;!- it has, the question does not arise.Development in accordance with these consents, if carried out after theappointed day, is, however, within the scope of the development charge, andcompensation under Part IV is related to the physical condition of the land atfte appointed day.34. Unfinished Buildings. Where buildings are in course of erection atlhe appointed day, clause 76 enables them to be completed without payment ofdevelopment charge. Compensation under Part IV is then assessed on the^sumption that they were complete at the appointed day.[32762] c
35. Compensation for A bortive Expenditure. Clause 77 preserves an fjowner&apos;s rights under existing law to compensation for abortive expenditure if gjrenewal of a permission granted before 1943 is refused.36. Local Authority Land.--Clause 79 provides, as regards land held by 1local authorities at the appointed day for express statutory purposes, that- I(a) no compensation is to be paid under Part IV;(b) no development charge is to be imposed in respect of the use of the land Ifor any statutory purpose;(c) the authority will be able to realise the value of the land for the prevailing Iuse in -the area if they dispose of the land for other development ot 1if it is purchased compulsorily.37. Land in Redevelopment A reas and New Town A teas. Clause 80 excepts Ifrom development charge any land purchased by a local authority for development Mor redevelopment as a whole, or by a development corporation under the New ITowns Act, and enables the Minister to require payment to the Land Commission mfrom time to time of a comprehensive charge instead. Land of this kind held 9at the appointed day is also excluded from the compensation payable under IPart IV.38. Statutory Undertakers&apos; Land. Clause 81 applies to operational land of Istatutory undertakers held at the appointed day the same principles as are applied wmto local authority land (see Clause 79).39.   National Coal Board. By provisions in Clause 81 the National Coal 9Board is excluded from claiming compensation under Part IV in respect of their Iownership of coal resources, and is exempt from development charge in respect fflof future mining operations.  Where coal resources are sterilised by the operation Mof planning control, the National Coal Board is entitled to claim compensation Ion the same basis as statutory undertakers.40. Charity Land.- A provision similar to that for statutory undertakers&apos; 9land is applied by Clause 82 to the land of churches, hospitals, schools and other 9such charities.41.   Crown Land. On the planning side, it is intended to preserve the 9position under present planning law, which is that local planning control does Inot operate against the Crown.  No compensation will be paid under Part IV 1in respect of land held by Government Departments, and development by Depart- mments will not be subject to development charge.42.   Requisitioned Land.- Compensation under Part IV will normally be Iassessed by reference to the state of the land before requisition.   There will be 9provision for adjustment it necessary where the landowner receives on derequisi-1tion the benefit of a building erected at Government expense (Clause 84).Part VII ^Supplemental43. This Part contains a number of financial and supplementary powers Mof which only the more important are set out in the following paragraphs.44. Exchequer Grants (Clauses 88-90). These Clauses are dealt with in 1Appendix B.45. Contributions from other Sources.-Clauses 91 and 92 enable any local Iauthority, statutory undertaker or Minister to contribute towards the expensesiincurred by a local planning authority or district council in the exercise of Ifunctions under the Bill. This is to meet the case where action is taken by an Hauthority at the request of some other body, or at the direction of the Minister, Ifor the benefit or partial benefit of that body. Contributions by Ministers are!limited to cases where some special benefit is secured in the national interest. M46. London.-Clause 105 makes certain adaptations for the administrative!County of London in order to secure consultation and co-ordination between the IL.C.C. and the City, and the L.C.C. and the Metropolitan Borough Councils.
APPENDIX BFINANCIAL MEMORANDUMI.-Estimate of Cost of Compensation.and of Income from DevelopmentCharges .1. There is no basis on which a close estimate can be made of the totalamount of compensation payable in respect of the restriction of developmentrights, but it is considered that it will be of the order of  400 million. Compen-ation will be satisfied by the issue of compensation stock on a date to be fixedby the Treasury, being not more than five yrears after the appointed day (Clausej,9). Interest will accrue on the amount of compensation as from the appointedjay at a rate to be prescribed by the Treasury, and will be paid in cash by theLand Commission on the date on which the stock is issued (Clause 61).2. The Exchequer will recoup the compensation debt by way of twenty equalinnual instalments of principal and interest combined from the Land Com-mission&apos;s Vote (Clause 62).3. Development charges will be collected by the Land Commission and paidnto the Exchequer (Clause 67). In practice, they will in whole or part be appro-priated in aid of the Land Commission^ Vote. Where a person to whom compen-sation is due becomes liable to pay development charges before the compensationstock is issued, the development charges will be set-off against the compensationand only the excess will be met by the issue of stock on the date fixed by theTreasury (Clause 59). The amount that will be received by way of developmentcharges will depend on. the course of future development. For the purpose ofpreparing an estimate it has been assumed that, for the first ten years, develop-ment will proceed at a steady rate approximating to the pre-1939 rate, and thatthereafter the rate will taper off to nothing by the thirtieth year. On this basisit is estimated that the total amount of development charges that should accrueduring that period will be approximately  660 million, of which about  80,million may be set off against compensation due during the period between theappointed day and the date on which compensation stock is issued. This sumwill, however, be subject to variation on account of the following factors. It willtend to increase (i) because the assumption that development charges will ceaseafter 30 years may be unduly pessimistic and (ii) because of the change in thevalue of money since 1939. It will tend to be reduced in respect of developmenton which development charges will either not be payable or will be reduced, viz.,(hi) cases where less than the full development value is charged to privatedevelopers, (iv) development by Government departments, (v) development byNew Town Development Corporations and (vi) development by local authoritiesin redevelopment areas (Clause 80). In the case of New Town DevelopmentCorporations and local authorities a payment in lieu of development charges willbe imposed as the Minister may determine, and this may reduce the grantspayable from the Exchequer. In the case of development by Government depart-ments the enhanced value of the land is retained by the Department and in thecase of New Town Development Corporations it may be recouped in part when aCorporation is wound up and its assets disposed of. Whilst, therefore, thedevelopment charges actually imposed may amount in the aggregate to less thanthe expenditure required to meet the compensation debt and the administrativeexpenses involved, this would not be a complete picture of the effect of the Billon the nation&apos;s finances as a whole.4. The restriction of development rights will exclude from the value of landany development value which it previously possessed and will in consequencereduce the value of land on which death duties will be assessed. The value ofcompensation stock issued will, however, come into estate duty liability and willPartially offset this loss in capital values of land. The effect on the yield ofestate duty is not expected to be substantial.tt. Revised grants scheme in respect of the re-development of areas ofextensive war damage, areas of bad layout or obsolete developmentand any associated overspill areas, or of areas of dereliction5. The revised grants scheme will supersede the grants scheme provisions inthe Town and Country Planning Act, 1944, which relate only to areas of extensivewar damage and will be applied retrospectively to re-development schemesaPproved by the Minister since 17th November, 1944.
The total cost to local authorities in respect of the acquisition and clearingof land in areas of extensive war damage may be of the order of  600 millionspread over a period of about twenty-five years. The cost to local authorities inrespect of areas of bad layout or obsolete development or dereliction is not expectedto exceed  15 million per annum during the next five years, after which the costwill probably rise.6. The Minister will have power under Clause 88 to provide by regulations,with the consent of the Treasury, for the payment of grants in respect of loancharges on money borrowed or assumed to be borrowed by local authoritiesrelating to (i) the cost of acquisition and clearing of land for the purpose of rede-velopment schemes during the period from the date of acquisition of land to thedate on which it is available for redevelopment, and to(ii)any capital loss incurredas a result of redevelopment, i.e., the difference between the cost of acquisition andclearing of the land and its value for the purpose of the local authority service tolwhich it is transferred; the valuation will be carried out by the Valuation Office!to such an extent as the Minister may specify.7. It is proposed to provide by regulations for a scale of grants at different!percentage rates to be paid for the years one to five, six to ten and eleven to sixty jjrespectively. The range of grants may vary from 90, 30 and 20 per cent, to 90, 701and 60 per cent, in the case of areas of extensive war damage and from 30, 20 and i10 per cent, to 80, 70 and 60 per cent, in the case of areas of bad layout, obsolc:. kdevelopment or dereliction. The range is, however, under consideration and may ifbe subject to modification. The basis of the application of the scale to individualslocal authorities will depend upon (i) the local authority&apos;s financial strength, and!(ii) the financial burden incurred by the local authority on redevelopment.8. The payment of grants will be conditional upon the Minister being-satisfied that the local authorities are carrying out schemes of redevelopment ina reasonably expeditious and efficient manner, and that the disposal of land is&apos;effected on lines approved by him.9.   The cost of grants is estimated to amount to  100,000 in the year ending I31st March, 1948, rising to about  3 million per annum five years later, and toan ultimate peak of two to three times that amount.Ill Grants in Respect of Planning Expenditure Incurred by Local   I, , Authorities outside Redevelopment Areas10.   The Minister will have power under Clause 89 to make regulations with Ithe consent of the Treasury providing for the payment of grant to loi I jauthorities in respect of compensation paid under Part II of the Bill, or in Irespect of any capital loss incurred by a local authority for planning reasons inthe acquisition of land and its diversion to a less valuable use.   It will be acondition of the payment of grant in such cases that the Minister&apos;s priorapproval is obtained.The types of cases to which this grants scheme will apply will be definedin the regulations after consultation with the Local Authorities&apos; Associations.The percentage grants payable will be that appropriate to the individual localauthority for the eleventh to sixtieth years in respect of redevelopment schemes,No reliable estimate of the amount of &quot;grant can be made at present.
