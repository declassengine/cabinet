203(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE- PROPERTY OF RMS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT)SECRETC. P, (46 ) 42415th November,1946COPYCABINETPROPOSED COMPENSATION SCHEME FOR OFFICERS OF THEIiTDIANSERWCETaTPQINiED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for IndiaI circulate for the approval of my colleaguesproposed scales of compensation to members of&quot;theS:e cretary of State&apos;s Services in India when theirappointments under the Secretary of State are terminatedas a result of constitutional changes.2.     Details of the scales are set out in the statementannexed to this note.     The amounts shown in them are inre spect solely of loss of career and prospects due to thebreak in the contract with the Secretary of State, and willbe additional to pension already earned by service.5.     Owing largely to the unusual pension system^ of theIndian Civil Service, the most important of the Servicesim question, the problem of devising compensation which,in the words of the Government of India Act, is &quot;just andequitable&quot;, has proved very complex.     The scheme nowproposed is the result of exhaustive consideration byofficials of the Treasury and the India Office.     It isaccepted by my statutory Advisers, whose concurrence insuch a matter&apos; I am required by the Government of India Actto obtain;   and has been approved by the India and BurmaCommittee.     The scales proposed are so calculated as tofulfil the pledge given to existing members of theServices by my predecessor and confirmed by me that, ontermination of their appointments under the Secretary ofState owing to constitutional changes, they would begranted terms not less favourable than those which, withthe&apos;approval of the Cabinet (W, P. (45) 273) were promisedin like circumstances to &quot;war service&quot; recruits to theServices in question.     1 may add. that a variety ofmethods.of calculation that have been examined producescales approximating to those now recommended,4.     The cost involved, which is estimated approximatelyat - 10 million, is by statute a liability on IndianRevenues..     The intention is that the proposed scales shallbe referred to the Viceroy to be laid before the IndianInterim Government.^ Office,15th No v emb er,1946P. -L.
