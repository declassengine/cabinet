(46) 411st October, 1946Copy No.CABINETEXCHANGE CONTROL BILLMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerI now circulate the text of this Bill, approved in principle by the Lordesident&apos;s Committee on the 26th July, 1946 (L.P. (46) 28th Meeting, Minute 4),d by the Legislation Committee on the 29th October (H.P.C. (46) 27th Meeting,inute4), subject to Cabinet concurrence. I also circulate a proof of the Whiter, to be published simultaneously with the Bill. This explains, in non-inical language, why we need Exchange Control, how it squares with ourternational obligations, and what the Bill contains.2. This has not been an easy Bill to draft. But the Solicitor-General andhave discussed it exhaustively over many months, aided by my advisers of thereasury and the Bank of England and by the Director of Public Prosecutions,nd we are all agreed that nothing less stringent would give us the powers whichis indispensable that the Government should possess in this field. My colleagues&quot;&quot; notice that the Solicitor-General in his Paper (CP. (46) 410) confirms myinion on this point.3.  There is nothing much new in the examples quoted by the Solicitor-eneral to illustrate the stringency of this Bill.   The Government have had theseowers for seven years under the Defence (Finance) Regulations, and there haveen no serious complaints at any time about the way in which they have beensed.   Indeed, our Exchange Control has attracted singularly little criticismring its seven years of life, and has served as a model for many other countries.re shall, of course, as stated in the White Paper, continue to administer thisntrol with common sense and flexibility, and in such a way as not to hindergitimate trade.   But, if it is to be administered flexibly, the powers must beide and strong, so as to avoid the need for continually referring to Parliamentor amending legislation, to stop up new holes invented by clever legal advisers ofscrupulous rich men.4.owersI have given particular attention to the possibility of modifying theto   determine   &quot;residence,&quot;   which   continue  powers   contained   inegulation 3C (3) and (4), but I am satisfied that it is not sa*fe to do so; andobserve that the Canadian Act entrusts similar powers to their Foreignxchange Control Board.   The control provided in Clause 6 over compensatione&amp;ls (e.g., a payment to the creditor here of an American, who arranges for a&apos;w pro quo in America) is particularly desirable, and uses substantially thelanguage as the existing. regulation 3C (2).   There have been severalocessful prosecutions of wealthy people under this, and I hope to bring moreneaderS to justice shortly.5- No doubt the Opposition will oppose this Bill, but they will not be onrong ground in doing so. Nor, in my view, provided that our case is clearlyn&quot; forcibly presented, will they secure much popular support. The short caseor this Bill is that without these powers v/e shall repeat the fiasco of the second[32635]
Labour Government, Or worse. As my colleagues know, we have, in any ,face, within the next few years, a very grave problem arising from our OvTDeficit. We can only hope to win through, and to maintain our financial 5and our exchange reserves, provided we can stop all anti-social &quot; flights&quot;capital from this Island.6. I ask my colleagues&apos; consent to the very early introduction of thisin the new Session.E.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,31st October, 1946.

4EXCHANGE CONTROL BILLMEMORANDUMPresented by the Ckancellor of the Exchequer to Parliamentby Command of His MajestyNovember, 1946LONDONHIS majesty&apos;s stationery OFFICECmd.
EXCHANGE CONTROL BILLThe need for Exchange Control(i) The object of our system of exchange control is to enable us to payour way abroad. To do this we must conserve and allocate our exchangeresources and our overseas income in the interests of the community as awhole, so that we can be sure of being able to pay for essential food, rawmaterials and other goods and services which we must import. Before thewar, the gap between our income from exports and the cost of.our purchasesabroad was filled by so-called &quot; invisible exports &quot; -interest and dividendson our investments abroad, payments for services such as shipping andinsurance, and the like. But, during the war, many of our ships were sunk,and we had to sell a large part of our overseas investments, while our otherincome from abroad was much reduced by the diversion of man-power andindustrial capacity from exports to the direct war effort. The Canadianand American credits are helping us to return, without an intolerable strainon our own people, to a peace-time economy; but it will clearly be necessaryfor a long time ahead to husband our resources very carefully, and to control-payments to people abroad. Without such control we should be powerlessto prevent a swift and fatal drain on our reserves, or to play our properpart in world trade.(2) In particular we cannot afford to allow capital investment abroad unlessthis clearly serves the national interest; and everyone agrees that thosespeculative movements of short-term capital, often called &quot; hot money &quot;,which so disturbed our pre-war international exchanges, are most undesirableand must in future be prevented. Since capital movements are not easy todistinguish from current transactions, we must supervise the whole range offoreign payments.   That is the purpose of this Bill.(3) The Bill, and our system of Exchange Control, are fully consistentwith our obligations to the International Monetary Fund and under theWashington Agreement (Cmd. 6708 of 1945). Indeed, the Bill is a necessarycondition of our fulfilment of these obligations. Among the-purposes of theFund, as set out in Article I, are&quot;. . . to promote exchange stability, to maintain orderly exchange,arrangements among members, and to avoid competitive exchange deprecia-tion. ... to assist in the establishment of a multilateral system of pay-ments in respect of current transactions between members and in theelimination of foreign exchange restrictions which hamper the growth ofworld trade ...&quot;The restrictions imposed under this Bill are designed not to hamper worldtrade but to assist it, and particularly to maintain the value of sterling bypreventing speculative attacks on it. The use of Exchange Control for thesepurposes was accepted at Bretton Woods. Article VI, Section 3, begins: &quot; Members may exercise such controls as are necessary to regulate inter-national capital movements ...&quot; In certain circumstances the Fund canexpressly require the use of Exchange Controls under Article VI, Sectioni (a):-&quot; A member may not make net use of the Fund&apos;s resources to meet alarge or sustained outflow of capital, and the Fund may request a memberto exercise controls to prevent such use of the resources of the Fund. If,after receiving such a request, a member fails to exercise appropriatecontrols, the Fund may declare the member ineligible to use the resourcesof the Fund.&quot;
The emphasis of,.the above Articles is-on,a liberal administration of ExchangeControls so that .genvUne ^current transactions are not obstructed. But therightv and, in some circumstances, the duty, of detecting and controllingcapital transfers is fully recognised..:&quot;(4&apos;) Similarly the Bill is completely consistent with the obligations assumedunder the Washington Agreement, and the recent Anglo-Argentine Agree-ments. Both Agreements provide for increasing freedom in the use Of sterlingfor current transactions, but recognise that other sterling transactions mayproperly be controlled.How Exchange Cawbrol works(5) If we are to pay promptly for our imports, we must receive promptpayments for our exports; and all useful foreign exchange, however acquired,must, therefore, be surrendered to the Exchange Equalisation Accountagainst payment in sterling. This is arranged through the banks, to whommuch of the day-to-day administration of Exchange Control is delegated bythe Treasury and the Bank of England. The Customs and Excise Departmentco-operate to ensure that exports outside the sterling area are properly invoiced,and that payment is duly received.(6) The flow of imports into the United Kingdom is regulated, not byExchange Control, but by Import Licensing, and it is through the importlicensing machinery that we shall honour our undertaking to the UnitedStates and Canada not to discriminate against their exports. The Britishsystem of Exchange Control ensures prompt payment for all permitted exports-Many of these imports are paid for in sterling, because sterling is a stableand reliable currency, and a foreigner who acquires sterling for his exportsto this country can &quot;spend it freely anywhere in the sterling area or convert itinto his own currency. It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government progres-sively to widen the area over which sterling currently acquired may be used.Our powers under this Bill will help us to fulfil the undertaking contained inthe Anglo-American Financial Agreement, regarding the convertibility ofsterling, after the 15th July, 1947, in respect of current transactions. Pay-men ts to sterling area countries are at present free from Exchange Control andthis is not affected by the Bill. oi :   -The legal framework of Exchange Control(7) Exchange Control at present operates under powers conferred by theEmergency Powers (Defence) Acts, as continued under the Supplies and Ser-vices (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945. The specific powers entrusted to theTreasury are contained in the Defence (Finance) Regulations (S.R. &amp; O.1939 No. 1620 as amended). These Regulations were added to and modifiedconsiderably between 1939 and 1942 and are not in suitable form for peaceconditions. The Exchange Control Bill accordingly re-writes the powers,dropping those no longer required and adding a few new provisions (seeparagraph 16). It is necessary to provide comprehensive powers of control,in order to check attempts at speculative capital withdrawals and other form?of evasion and trickery, and because the degree to which control is necessarymay vary from time to time. The Bill, therefore, provides that the Treasury^may regulate our external payments. But the Treasury&apos;s present power- 11issue exemption orders will continue to be freely used, and Exchange cccli^will not be administered more stringently thari liithefto.(8) Foreigners may ask how the Bill affects them. Exchange Cdhtrdissmust clearly operate mainly 00 a territorial basis, rather than dh that ofnationality, since.foreign exchange paid td a British national.:abroad is as53885
much lost as if it were paid to a foreigner. But, in practice, the foreigneris not normally asked to surrender currency of his own country and, if hesettles here, he can enjoy the ordinary facuities of a British resident. Whenhe returns to his own country he can draw his income from here on the sameterms as though he had remained at home throughout. There is nodiscrimination against foreigners as such, but they must conform to our ruleswhile they are here, just as they are expected to observe our rules of the road.The Contents of the Bill(9) Part I restricts dealing in gold and foreign currency except with authorised!dealers (principally banks), and requires gold and most foreign currencies to-be sold to them. The authorised dealers in turn are obliged to sell to and buyfrom the Exchange Equalisation Account. By this means official exchangerates are maintained and the central supply of exchange is fed,(10) Part II prevents payments to persons outside the sterling area, exceptwith Treasury permission. While it is necessary to supervise all types ofpayment, it is intended to issue Payments Orders (as hitherto) under Clause 30exempting approved classes of payments, which the banks can then handlewithout formality.(11) Part III maintains the existing control over the issue and transfer ofsecurities where non-residents are concerned, and introduces a new controlover foreign and bearer securities for reasons which are explained in para-graph 16. These controls are largely administered through the StockExchanges, and are essential to prevent the flight of capital in unauthorisedinvestments abroad, and the dissipation of our remaining foreign invest-rnents. The present power to require foreign securities to be sold compulsorilyto the Treasury has been dropped.&apos; (12) Part IV continues present controls over import and export of currencynotes, securities, etc., and provides the necessary powers to ensure that exportsare properly paid for.(13) Part V contains miscellaneous provisions concerning the prompt collec-tion of debts, control&apos;of foreign subsidiaries, and ancillary matters. Clause 25is a new power to prevent evaders of the control from continuing to enjoy thebenefits of their evasion.(14) Part VI contains, in addition to definitions and other formal provisions,the important power already mentioned to make exceptions by TreasuryOrder, and new powers (Clause 39) over emigrants which post-war conditionsrequire.(15) The Schedules axe supplementary to the Clauses which refer to themand introduce no important changes.Principal Changes in Exchange Control(16) Several significant changes have already been mentioned) notably theabandonment of the power to. require foreign securities owned by UnitedKingdom residents to be sold to the Treasury. This does not affect the posi-tion of securities already acquired by or placed at the disposal of the Treasurytinder the Financial Powers (U.S.A- Securities) Act, 1941. AH references to&quot; enemy &quot; interests have also been dropped, as. they are provided for in theTrading with the Enemy legislation. One important new control is proposed.During the war all: readily usable foreign securities were registered with theBank of England arid those in this country not acquired or pledged by theTreasury, together with many British bearer securities, were removed to
Canada for safe custody. But they have now come back, and, under peaceconditions, new safeguards against the transfer of British owned securities toforeign ownership, save for value received, are needed. Securities on a UnitedKingdom register can usually only be transferred with the co-operation of theBritish registrar, who is required to satisfy himself that the authorities haveapproved the transfer which he records. For the other securities it is proposedto introduce a parallel safeguard, by requiring them after an appointed dateto be lodged with or to the order of an approved bank chosen by the ownerof the security. The ownership of such securities will not be affected by these/-arrangements, and (if the securities are free of any suspicion of enemy owner-fLship at any stage) the bank will collect dividends etc. for the owner: but thedocument of title will not pass out of the keeping of a bank until it is presentedfor redemption. It is hoped by these means without any burdensome restric-tion on the owners, to prevent illicit transfer of such securities. Arrange-ments will be made to meet the reasonable requirements of brokers, solicitorsand others who may need temporarily to hold such documents.Exchange Control and International Relations(17) We are not alone in needing Exchange Control, nor is our systemunique. It is parallelled by similar systems, not only throughout the Empire,but in many foreign countries. Most of these rest, at the moment, on war-time powers, but the foundations of the New Zealand control were laid by anAct of 1936, and in recent months Canada and Czechoslovakia have enactedlegislation to put their controls on a peace-time basis. Other Governments areexpected to do the same. It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government toco-operate with all Governments- whose Exchange Controls are based onsimilar principles, with a view to promoting order in this complex and difficultfield. Without orderly exchanges, the recovery of international trade, onwhich so much of our own prosperity depends, would be seriously endangered.(53885)   Wt, 1819 1902   151   11/46   D.L.
