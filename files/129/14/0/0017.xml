&apos;&quot;&quot;   ilkHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (46) 4178TH NOVEMBER.,  1 946CABINETTIMBER FOR HOUSINGMemorandum Toy the Minister of Health1.      I find it necessary to &quot;bring to the notice of rnycolleagues a grave danger which threatens our housingprogramme in England and- Wales.      There is no lack ofhousing schem.es and no lack of building agencies:    up tothe point where building begins progress has indeed been  vfully up to my expectations.2.      There are difficulties in getting enough buildinglabour of the right kind at the right time but&apos; these areto be expected and the Minister of Labour and NationalService and the Minister of Works are, I know doing- allthey can to help:    it is because of the success of ourefforts in getting work under way that our limited man-power is spread too thinly for rapid building.3-     -There are problems of the efficiency of the buildingindustry which react both on progress and on. the cost ofbuilding and on which, after con.sa.ltation with the Ministerof Labour and National Service and the Minister of Works,I intend to make proposals to the Cabinet.4?      Despite the best efforts of the Minister of Works andthe Minister of Supply there are individual materials andcomponents for houses for the provision of which we arebound to rely mainly on home production and where supplyis not yet equal to demand.      This is, however, a day today production battle on which I do not need to trouble mycolleagues.5.      The supply of timber, present and prospective,  Is theone matter which is entirely outside my control and whichon present indications - will go far to wreck our housingprogramme.      I can put the position shortly by saying -(1 )(   That on the -present basis of 2 standards perhouse about 460,000 standards are requiredfor the 230,000 houses to which we werealready committed at the end of September(i.e., houses in approved tenders or licencesissued at that date) and that our obligationsare increasing at the rate of nearly 20,000houses (or 40,000 standards of soft wood) eachmonth;COPY NO.

(2)    That to meet these obligations the allocation upto 30th September has amounted to 2h6,000standards (the equivalent of 123,000 houses)and&apos; that the continuing monthly allocation is,at the rate of about 30,000 standards (or theequivalent of 15,000 houses) a month.(3)    That in the last two quarters we have alreadyoverdrawn our allocations of timber and I amadvised that without any expansion of ourprogramme there must be a widespread hold upof housing on account of shortage of timberin the early months of next&apos; year;(h)    That the allocations of timber on a basis of twostandards per house only permit of a programmeof 180,000 houses a year, whereas&apos;we are aimingat a programme of some 100,000 in excess ofthis figure.6.      These figures, as stated, are fox5 England and Wales,but I am informed that the position with regard to the supplyof timber for housing schemes in Scotland is equally serious.7.      I have taken action to reduce the amount of timber perhouse from two standards to 1.6 standards per house:    thismeans a number of economies which are tolerable butregrettable,  e.g.  the elimination of timber joists andboarding throughout the ground floor and the substitution ofsolid floors.      The supply position, as to suitable substitutesis itself difficult and in any ease this is a palliative andnot a cure.8.      This reduction of standards ought to give us on presentallocations of timber 225*000 permanent houses a year of allkinds, a figure which is in itself woefully inadequate andwhich will give rise to pungent criticism in the country.9.      There are two ways out -The first is an increase in the allocation of timber fornew permanent housing.      This allocation is already some h*y/* &apos;of the total supply available for all purposes and,.especiallyin view of previous adjustments in favour of housing,  I donot wish to make demands on my colleagues for further cuts:nor indeed would any amounts possible of attainment in thisway be likely to bridge the gap.The second and in my view the only effective remedylies in securing further imports at an early date.      I amaware that the President of the Board of Trade has madecontinuous efforts to improve the position but I feel ourposition in the months ahead is likely to be so desperatethat I must ask my colleagues to consider any- possible action.10.   -I understand that in, Canada there are substantialsupplies of soft wood and I suggest that a special appealmight be made to the Prime Minister of Canada to help us inarranging for the immediate export of timber to this countryin view of the urgent necessity.

11. I need not emphasise the urgent necessity of steppingup the export from Germany of timber suitable for house-building or of making any possible arrangements which willget us. more timber from our normal suppliers in the Balticcountries- as quickly as possible or of seeking supplies oftimber from, Yugoslavia,  etc.A.
