aRCUUTEP.l...&amp;/ll,..,,Ai t &apos;&quot;or.t**THIS DOCUMEKT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.....Mp^y^^.WJECRET copy No..^J3D3,?.(L6) Llh1st November,  19h&amp;*CABINETPALESTINERELEASE OF DETAINED JE.7ISH LEADERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesMy colleagues will recall that on the25th October (C.M.,(h6)  91st Conclusions, Minute 2) I informedthem that there was some prospect that the Jewish Agencywould make a public declaration dissociating themselves fromthe use of violence by Jews in Palestine and. promisingco-operation in the suppression of terrorism.      I also said,that,  if such a declaration were made, it should be possibleto authorise the release of the Jewish leaders who had beenheld in detention in Palestine since 29th June.      Such adeclaration has now been embodied, in the Resolutions passedby the Inner Zionist Council at their meeting in Palestineon 29th October.      The text of these Resolutions is attachedas Appendix A.      I cannot pretend that the terms of theResolutions are as satisfactory as could have been wishedand I have some sympathy with the analysis contained in thetelegram from the High Commissioner for Palestine No.  1776(copy attached as Appendix 3)&apos;*      Resolution 5*  however, doescontain a denunciation of terrorism as a political weaponand an appeal to the Jewish community in Palestine to deny allassistance and support to the extreme terrorist groups.This denunciation has been reinforced by recent speeches onsimilar lines by senior members of the Jewish Agency,Mr. Ben G-urion in Paris and Mr. Kaplan in Palestine.      Thesespeeches can have left the Jewish community under nomisapprehension regarding the attitude these responsibleleaders propose to adopt towards terrorism.      The&quot;Palestine Post&quot;, in 0 powerful leading article which shouldhave considerable influence,  has also added its weight tothis denunciation.      There are signs that representativeJewish institutions in Palestine have already initiated&apos;action designed to re-educate the Jewish community towardsa disavowal of violence.      In present circumstances I feelthat this is as much as we can hope for and as much as theJewish leaders could undertake with any hope of success,having regard to the state of Jewish feeling in Palestine.2. I am convinced that the Indefinite detention ofthese oorsons without trial would become increasinglydifficult to defend and that the action taken by the Jewsprovides logical grounds for their release - an opportunitywhich is unlikely to recur in the immediate future.      Their

detention was ordered &quot;because of their association with**a      J. *i *co-ordinated campaign of terrorism in Palestine.      Any suchassociation has now formally &quot;been disavowed by the Inner ZionistCouncil;, which, represents the responsible &quot;bodies i.n the Jewishcommunity.      I hope that the release of the leaders will nowcontribute to relieving tension in Palestine,- which must be oneof the primary objects of our policy at the present moment,will help strengthen the more moderate and responsible elementsamong the Jews in Palestine,  and will also ease our difficultieswith regard to Jewish representation at the resumed PalestineConference in December.      I propose,  therefore,  subject to theapproval of my colleagues -(a)    to inform the High Commissioner that he is authorisedto release the detained Jewish leaders on Tuesday,5th November](&apos;b)    to make a statement in Parliament to this effect onthat date;(c)    to authorise the High Commissioner at the same time,  inthe light of strong Arab representations at thePalestine Conference and since,  to approve the releaseof three Palestinian Arabs who have been detained inthe Seychelles on grounds of their collaboration withthe Axis powers during the war and to permit thereturn to their country of two others who werereleased from the Seychelles on health grounds butexcluded from Palestine.3. The statement I propose to make would lead up to therelease of the Jewish leaders by a brief account of our recentconversations with representatives of the Jewish Agency and wouldInclude the text of the following announcements which I havesuggested to the High Commissioner should be issued in Jerusalemsimultaneously with my statement in  the House of Commons.(a) Announcement regarding release of Jewish leaders:&quot;In view/ of the condemnation of terrorism embodiedin the Resolutions announced at the meeting on the29th October of the Inner Zionist Council, which isaccepted as an earnest of the intention of theJewish Agency and of representative Jewish.  institutions in Palestine to dissociate themselvesentirely from the campaign of violence and to dotheir utmost to root out this evil, His Marjesty&apos;sGovernment have concurred in the release by thePalestine Government of the detained Jewishleaders.&quot;(b) Announcement regarding release of Arabs,:.   &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have now fully consideredrepresentations made to them by the Arab delegatesto the Palestine Conference on the subject of thePalestinian Arabs detained in the Seychelles.      Inthe light of these representations and as a gestureof goodwill at this time, when important decisionson the future of Palestine are in the b..lance,they have decided to release these detainees and.to permit their return to Palestine along with twoother Arabs formerly detained in the Seychelles butalready released on health grounds.&quot;

1+. The Resolution of the Inner Zionist Councildenouncing terrorism appears to hove provoked a defiantoutburst of violence in Palestine during the past week.The continuance of such, incidents throws a great strainon the Palestine Government and. particularly on the militaryforces and police.      Undoubtedly a fierce internal struggleover policy between the more moderate and the extremeelements among the Jews is in progress.      I can only hopethat the action proposed now will strengthen the hands ofthose Jewish sections which are opposed to violence, will leadto an improvement in the Palestine situation and help removeone of the difficulties of representation at the Conference.5, I ask the approval of my colleagues for the courseof action proposed in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this paper./-i.

APPENDIX  &apos;A&apos;1* The Inner Zionist Council has heard the report ofthe Executive on the talks which took place in London betweenmembers of  the Executive of the Jewish Agency and the BritishGovernment on the latter1s. invitation.      The Inner Councilexpresses its appreciation of the valiant stand taken by theJewish Agency representatives in placing the demand for animmediate increase of Jewish immigration in the forefront ofthe discussions;    in refusing to entertain any proposalsincompatible with the right of Jews to enter Palestine underall circumstances;    in declining to make the release of theleaders from detention;,  or orders of detention, an object ofpolitical bargaining;    and in resisting attempts to breakthe spirit of the Yishuv and the Zionist Movement.2. The Inner Zionist Council expresses deep disappointmentat the Government&apos;s absolute refusal to expedite the  transferof the survivors of European Jewry to Palestine.      It is withdeep resentment that the Council notes the Mandatory Power&apos;scontinued disregard of its international obligations towards theJewish people, as embodied in the Mandate,  and its perpetuationof the Land Laws, which discriminate against Jews in theirNational Home and jeopardise the civic status of Jews in othercountries.      At the very moment of the Jewish people&apos;s mostdire need,  the Mandatory Power has imposed severe limitsupon Jewish immigration. .    It has disregarded the unanimousrecommendations of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry,appointed on its own initiatiye, for the immediate transferof 100,000 Jews to Palestine.      It has mobilised itspolitical and military might to institute a blockade againstthose who seek entry into the land of their hopes.    : Theserefugees are hunted on land and sea, ana when caught aredeported to new detention camps outside Palestine.      TheMandatory has instituted a repressive and arbitrary regimein Palestine.      By these measures Great Britain is destroyingthe legal and moral foundation of her rule in this country,based as it  is on the Mandate and its faithful implementation.3.&quot; The Inner Zionist Council re-affirms its convictionthat no power on earth can prevent homeless Jews of theDiaspora from reaching the shores of their National Home.The Jewish people the world over,  and particularly the Yishuv,will do everything in its power to  save the Jewish survivorsin Europe and oppressed Jews elsewhere,  by their transfer to,and settlement in,  Palestine.4. In face of repression and policies which ignore thevital interests of the Jewish people,  and its right to fullrehabilitation in Palestine,  the Inner Zionist Councildeclares once again that the only solution to the twin problemsof the Jewish people and Palestine lies in the establishmentof a Jewish State.      The Council calls upon the ZionistMovement and the whole Jewish people to close its ranks andbrace itself for further efforts for the early achievementof this historic aim.RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY. THE INNER ZIONIST COUNCIL29th October,  19h 7

5* The Inner Zionist Council declares that the ZionistMovement has always rejected and continues to rejectterrorist bloodshed as an. instrument of political struggle. &quot;The banner of Zionism,  the Council declares, must be keptpure and unbesmirched.      The Council denounces withoutreservation the bloodshed caused by groups of terrorists whodefy national discipline and thereby place themselves outsidethe ranks of the organised community.      These deeds defilethe struggle of the Jewish people and distort its character;they strengthen the hands of the opponents of Zionism and theenemies of the Jewish&apos; people.      The Council calls upon theYishuv to isolate these groups and deny them all encouragement,support,  and assistance.6. The Inner Zionist Council further expresses deepgratitude to the President and people of the United Statesfor their continued support of the demand for the immediatetransfer to Palestine of the displaced Jews in Europe,  andfor the President&apos;s declaration that he favours theestablishment of a Jewish State.      The Council expresses thehope that the Government of the United States will continueto render effective assistance to the Zionist Movement,  andso help to secure the early achievement of these aims.      TheCouncil also expresses the hope that progressive forces allover the world will assist the Jewish people in re-buildingits country and achieving its full independence in it,thereby assuring the Jewish people of its rightful place inthe comity of nations.

APPENDIX  &apos;B&apos;Copy of a Telegram-(No.  1776) dated 30th October,  1946,from General Sir A.  Cunningham (Palestine) to theSecretary of State for the Colonies.Text of resolution passed yesterday evening bythe Inner Zionist Council has been telegraphed to you infull in my telegram No. 1772.i&apos;7e;7: &apos;- &apos; &apos; a -&quot; a iVt.   - . &apos;   -2. In commenting on this resolution I wish to make itclear that I have always recognised that detained leadersshould be released at some time or other,  but have naturallywished that as a result,   adequate safeguards for peace inthis country should be obtained.      It is idle to presume thatresolution as framed meets this requirement.      It will beobserved that denunciation of terrorism is wrapped up in andovershadowed by a defiant restatement of opposition toH.M.  Government!s policy regarding immigration which indeedforms almost the whole subject of the resolution and areiteration of charge that Great Britain is breaking mandateand destroying legal and mora.1 foundations of her rule.Qualified as it is by this preamble which contains all oldarguments -which have been used in the past by members of theAgency in their incitement of Yishuv to break the law,   thedeclaration on terrorism loses practically all its force.3. As regards the declaration itself:-    in its denouncementit only covers terrorists who defy national discipline, andterrorist bloodshed,  the declaration,  therefore,  only coversStern and Irgun and that for only so long as they are outsidethe ranks of organised communities.     Bloodshed by Hagariais apparently permissible.      Furthermore,  there is no mentionwhatever of sabotage.     You will note also that declarationitself is considerably weaker than that suggested by you,see your telegram No.  2002, paragraph 6.U. Nevertheless,  in spite of these objections I feelthat you would have wished me to recommend that declarationregarding terrorism should be regarded as- a satisfactory .consideration for immediate release of leaders,  and I wouldhave been prepared to do so but for two other importantfactors.(a) Early this morning two bomb outrages have  taken placeresulting in deaths of 2 possibly 3 British soldiers,  andinjuries to 13 British soldiers as well as 6 Arab civilians.(b) 2nd November is Balfour Day and an Arab strike hasalready been called on  that day with possibilities ofdisturbances.&apos;      In the interests of law- and order,  I regretI cannot consider release of leaders in Lot run until effect ofoutrage and any events has died down.      Furthermore, I do notwish to overstate matter of morale of the  soldiers, police andBritish community, but must again emphasize the importance ofkeeping it in mind.5. I hope,  therefore,   that you will agree  to question ofreleases being kept  in abeyance until early next week when Iwill communicate with you again.
