(46) 401.29*A October, 1946.CABINET.THE IMPORT PROGRAMME 1947.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.THE Ministerial Committee on Economic Planning, at its meeting on the28th October (M.E.P. (46) 5th Meeting, Minute 1) considered the attached memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and its annex. The committee considered that the problems outlined in the memorandum were of the veryhighest importance and that a wrong decision on them might involve the countryin risks of an economic disaster comparable with 1931.2. The Minister of Fuel and Power, while appreciating the seriousness ofthe foreign exchange position, has pointed out that if the proposal not to allothard currency for the abolition of petrol rationing in 1947 is approved by theCabinet, the reasons for it should be explained; the fullest publicity will be essential to show why dollars cannot be found for the necessary extra petrol.Such a decision will, moreover, involve him in severe administrative difficultiessince petrol rationing is proving increasingly difficult to police. He also proposes that should the balance of payments position subsequently improve, e.g., through a fall in United States prices, the question should be reconsidered.3. The Committee agreed that in addition to the four steps proposed inparagraph 21 a further point should be added : &quot; (v) Consideration of the extent to which the buyers of our exports canbe obliged to pay for them in goods or convertible currencies.&quot;4. Subject to the above points, the Committee approved the attached memo-randum and invited me to submit it to the Cabinet.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S.W. 1.2Wi October, 1946.

The question of the Overseas Balance over the next few years remainsmuch the most acute of all our financial headaches. Unless we are prepared to-apply strong and often unpopular remedies we shall face a very serious situationindeed well before 1950.3. We are using up the United States and Canadian Loans, and our otherprospective external financial resources for 1947 and 1948, much too fast. Thisresults from the delayed effect of the 1946 feeding stuffs crisis, from the rise in american prices and from the heavy and continuing drain due to military andpolitical expenditure outside this country. We must make up our minds topractice a strict economy in the import programme from hard currency sources,and to work out and apply a strong plan of remedial measures, to be developedprogressively during the next two or three years.4. We have to decide now the firm import programme for the first half of1947 and a provisional import programme for the second half. It may also be convenient to fix the export target for 1947 now.5. I think it would be unwise to slash our import programmes from hard currency sources in 1947 to the full extent which the figures justify. But I must make it very clear to my colleagues that, unless we can secure quick and effectiveremedial action, we shall face highly unpleasant decisions in 1948 and 1949.6. I therefore propose that what are described in paragraph 6 of the paper as the &quot;must&quot; programmes be accepted, and I also propose that we accept themodest Board of Trade consumer goods programme.7. I have discussed the supplementary food programme in detail with the.Minister of Food and he has agreed to allocations from non-dollar sources, asset out in paragraph 17 of the paper, and to an allocation from dollar sources of  21 millions for the first half of 1947, and, provisionally, of  26 millions forthe second half. This is an increase of  10 millions on what my officials had recommended in the attached paper. But I am prepared to run this risk in orderto increase the quantity and. variety of our people&apos;s food in 1947.8. But I cannot afford to allot hard currencies for any other relaxationsin 1947, such as the abolition of petrol rationing or for any other new require-ments not included in the programme.9. It is quite clear that, in these grim conditions, there can be no relaxation in the export drive and I propose a target for the second half of 1947 at 150 percent, of 1938 volume.10.

The question of the Overseas Balance over the next few years remainsmuch the most acute of all our financial headaches. Unless we are prepared to*apply strong and often unpopular remedies we shall face a very serious situationindeed well before 1950.3. We are using up the United States and Canadian Loans, and our otherprospective external financial resources for 1947 and 1948, much too fast. Thisresults from the delayed effect of the 1946 feeding stuffs crisis, from the rise in american prices and from the heavy and continuing drain due to military andpolitical expenditure outside this country.

We have to decide now the firm import programme for the first half of1947 and a provisional import programme for the second half. It may also be convenient to fix the export target for 1947 now.5. I think it would be unwise to slash our import programmes from hard currency sources in 1947 to the full extent which the figures justify. But I must make it very clear to my colleagues that, unless we can secure quick and effectiveremedial action, we shall face highly unpleasant decisions in 1948 and 1949.6. I therefore propose that what are described in paragraph 6 of the paper as the &quot;must&quot; programmes be accepted, and I also propose that we accept themodest Board of Trade consumer goods programme.7. I have discussed the supplementary food programme in detail with the.Minister of Food and he has agreed to allocations from non-dollar sources, asset out in paragraph 17 of the paper, and to an allocation from dollar sources of  21 millions for the first half of 1947, and, provisionally, of  26 millions forthe second half. This is an increase of  10 millions on what my officials had recommended in the attached paper.

Lastly, 1 draw my colleagues&apos; attention to the constructive proposalsfor remedial action in paragraph 21 of the paper, and particularly to the most urgent need of switching, as far and as fast as possible, from dollar to non-dollar
sources of supply. I understand that work is already in hand on this in theDepartments; we must press this forward with great energy, and I ask mycolleagues&apos; full support for this.11.   I propose that the Committee report to the Cabinet recommending 1(i) the adoption of the import programme as outlined above,(ii) the adoption of a provisional export target as in paragraph 9 above,(iii) that the plan for remedial action should be worked out in detail as rapidly as possible.H. D.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,23rd October, 1946.ANNEX.Balance of Payments Working Party.Import Programme for 1947.Note by the Treasury.1. The 1947 import programme raises the whole question of how we shallspend the United States and Canadian loans. This is the first programmedetermination to take full account of the loans. We have the money, the obliga-tions have to be honoured in 1947.2. We shall enter 1947 stronger than we expected. The 1946 deficit isnow put at only  475 millions (Appendix A), compared with the original forecast of  750 millions. This results largely from the success of the export drive.We expect to enter 1947 with financial resources net gold and dollar reserves and the unused part of the United States and Canadian credits of some 1,500 millions. We need to hold a reserve of at least  500 millions (before thewar it was much greater), so that we cannot put the disposable resources muchabove  1,000 millions.3.   This must meet our overseas financial needs until (a) we have established a firm equilibrium in our balance of payments; and(b) all the significant currencies in the world are multilaterally convertible.4. Condition (a) is self-evident. But (b) is even more crucial. During1947 sterling must become convertible; i.e., if we have an adverse balance withany other country, we pay it in gold or United States dollars or their equivalent.But if we have a surplus with another country, we get gold or United States dollars for it only if that country&apos;s currency is convertible; if it is not, the surplus will only extinguish sterling debt or accumulate a credit, and is not available for financing our deficits. Thus we pour out gold and dollars to countries withwhich we have deficits and receive paper from countries with which we havesurpluses. The pattern of our trade is that we have huge deficits with certain countries (e.g., North America, Argentina, Sweden) and considerable surpluseswith the European and sterling area countries which cannot be transferredagainst these deficits. Until these surpluses can be translated into gold and dollars to match our deficits, we can experience a large draft on our reserves while our overall balance of payments may look quite favourable. It is clear thatEuropean currencies will not in general become convertible for many years tocome, until their productive and exporting power has been restored.5. In framing our import programme, we must therefore take into accountnot only our overall balance of payments but also the implied rate of exhaustion of our reserves.The Overall Position.6. The Departmental import programmes (analysed in Appendix B) containvery little flexibility, either in quantity or source. They are still dominated byworld shortages; there will be some improvement in world supplies of food and
raw materials in 1947, but not much. These programmes have been examinedcarefully and, subject to certain amendments in Appendix B, we see no alternative to acceptance of the &apos;&apos; must &apos;&apos; programmes for basic food, raw materials, tobacco,machinery, industrial goods, petroleum, seeds and animals. The only scope for decision is in supplementary food (for improving the diet), consumer goods, and additional petrol for abolishing rationing.7. The overall position on the basis of Departmental programmes is asfollows : 	1st half	2nd half	Total	(Total	1947.	1947.	1947.	1946.)	 m.	 m.	 m.	 m.Imports  &quot;Must&quot;    .........					623	672	1.295	Supplementary food	56	72	128	Consumer goods	1U	1U	23	Extra petrol	si	&apos;       4			-694	-759	- 1,453	(-1,160)Overseas Government expenditure ...	- 95	- 80	-   175*	(-   320)	-789	-839	- 1,628	(-1,480)Exports and re-exports	4-615	4-685	4-1,300	(4-  910)Net invisibles,  &amp;c.      ...      ...	4- 40	4- 45	4-    85	(4-    95)	-134	-109	-   243	(-   475)* Net (including receipts from surplus stores).This is not very satisfactory; the Cabinet fixed a target last April that weshould balance our accounts in the first half of 1947, apart from terminal warcosts. Some  125 millions may properly be regarded as &quot;terminal war costs,&quot;but it is clear that, if the Cabinet&apos;s decision were implemented, there wouldbe little scope for any supplementary food programme at all.8. An important reason for this is the growth in the &quot; must&quot; import pro-gramme resulting primarily from the rise in prices. Indeed, the above mayunderstate the position, for the figures take into account only those price increases which are already known. On the other hand, the Board of Trade exportestimates on which the above figures are based may be too conservative on price.9. We must again draw attention to the estimated level of Governmentoverseas expenditure. The gross figure is estimated at around  300 millions,offset by mainly non-recurring Government receipts (e.g., sale of surplus military stores) of about  125 millions, leaving a net  175 millions. The prospectiveexpenditure is being examined further inter-Departmentally, but the above figures are almost certainly too low. No allowance is made for refugees or post-U.N.R.R.A. relief except Austria; the estimated expenditure of  60 millions on Germany is too low in the light of recent developments; there is no allowance for certain contingent commitments in the Far East, e.g., payment of war damage compensation. Relatively little of this expenditure is reflected imme-diately in a drain on our dollars- Germany is the only substantial dollar userin this field. But the expenditure as a whole is directly competitive with theimport programme.Drain on Reserves.10. However, the balance-sheet would be tolerable were it not for its impli-cations in gold and dollars. The programmes above represent a deficit on current account with the United States and Canadian dollar areas of some  220 millions in the first half of 1947, and  250 millions in the second half, making  470millions in all (compared with estimated  410 millions in 1946). Moreover, wehave a prospective deficit of  70 millions with Argentina (which must be paid infree sterling) and deficits of some  30 millions with other countries, e.g., Sweden,from which we are unlikely to be able to borrow. Add to this perhaps  50millions, representing United States and Canadian dollars which we shall probably have to provide for the sterling area countries in excess of their dollar earnings. The total is over  600 millions. In round figures, taking into accountour receipts of gold from the sterling area and such convertible currencies as wemay secure from countries with which we have surpluses, the drain on our
reserves will be of the order of  500 millions. The rate will be higher in 1947than in 1946 (largely because of prices), and higher in the second half of 1947than in the first half (for seasonal reasons &quot;and also because of growing-availability).11. The overall balance of payments figures assume that we shall exportall the goods we can, and that other countries will not find it necessary to restrict imports from the United Kingdom because they are short of currentlyavailable sterling. The relationship between the overall figures and the drain on our reserves suggests that these assumptions will probably prove incompatibleas 1947 proceeds. How strictly we should then in each case wish to carry outthe policy of not exporting our goods unless we get goods or convertible currency in return is a matter for decision when the time comes.12. If 1948 is no better than 1947, we shall exhaust in 1948 the disposableresources of  1,000 millions with which we enter 1947. The Canadian Loan willhave been exhausted by the end of 1947; the United States Loan by the spring of 1949. We certainly cannot expect that by that time multilateral convertibilitywill be established.13. In the Treasury&apos;s view, there are two main policy implications ofthis: (i) Strict economy in the import programmes from North America, Argen-tina and Sweden in 1947.(ii) Concerted action to expand our income from the countries with whichwe have deficits and to switch our sources of supply away from thesecountries.1947 Programme Recommendations.14. As stated in paragraph 6 above, we think it would be unwise to cut the 1947 basic programmes at this stage. These are essential requirements, andwe think it would be wrong to risk impairing industrial recovery in 1947. Butit is quite clear that, unless very vigorous action is taken on the lines proposedin paragraph 21 below, we shall be unable to afford to continue to import from north America on anything like the scale of the 1947 basic programmes. Deci-sions on consumer goods, petrol rationing and supplementary food must be takenin the light of this acute dollar shortage; decisions to spend more on these programmes commit dollars not only for 1947 but also for 1948 and 1949.15. The consumer goods programme contains only  3 millions in each half-year from the critical sources, and nearly the whole of this represents speciallyscarce articles, e.g., furniture, rubber footwear. Moreover, our non-discrimina-tion commitments require that, if we import from any source, we should alsoimport from United States and Canada. The only practical possibility herewould be to interpret the commitments somewhat less rigorously than at present.We do not propose a formal reduction in the programme figure.16. The cost of abolishing petrol rationing is all dollars-$30 millions.The Ministry of Fuel and Power attaches great importance to this being done as soon as possible, but the Treasury cannot recommend it.17. The supplementary food programme is inevitably the largest problem.The following allocations are proposed :  	1st half 1947.		2nd half	1947.	Requirement. Allocation.		Requirement.

Expenditure on United States films will be  16-17 millions in 1947.This could not be reduced significantly in 1947 unless there were legislation toimpose duties early in the 1946-47 session, for the remittances take place in the nine months after the actual import of the films. There are serious difficulties,moreover, in formulating a satisfactory scheme.  It is intended that everything
possible should continue to be done to encourage the production of competitive PBritish films, and it is hoped that our earnings from the exhibition of British &quot;films in the United States will ultimately narrow the deficit.19. The export drive must necessarily go on. The figures in paragraph above are based upon recorded British exports of  1,300 millions in 1947, whichis equivalent to a rate of 50 per cent, above 1938 volume in the second half of1947. This is a Board of Trade forecast which is believed to be practicable; thelabour force working on exports now is about one-third above 1938. It issuggested that for present planning purposes, pending consideration of the 1947Economic Survey, the export target for the second half of 1947 be set at 50 percent, above 1938 volume.20. The effect of these proposals (set out in paragraph 18 of Appendix B)is to reduce the overall deficit in the first half to  117 millions and in the second half to  90 millions, a total of  207 millions. The import programme providesimports of 82 per cent, of 1938 volume, compared with 69 per cent, in 1946.Long-Term Proposals.21.   The Treasury proposes a four-pronged attack on the critical 1947-50situation revealed by this series of import programmes : (i) Special steps to develop our exports to the &quot; desirable &quot; sources, ifnecessary at the expense of exports elsewhere,(ii) Development of long-term sources of supply in the sterling area and europe, e.g., Western European steel, dairy produce, bacon, Rhodesiantobacco, &amp;c.   This cannot achieve much in 1947, but action on theselines can yield considerable dividends in 1948-50.(iii) Examination of United Kingdom food production in order to reducedollar expenditure on food to a minimum.(iv) Examination of oil policy; oil is a very heavy user of dollars, not only for purchases of petroleum products from United States companies,but also the dollar expenditure of the British companies.22. The economic recovery of Western Europe is crucial to the solution ofthe problems outlined in this paper hoth to provide us with an easier source ofsupplies as in (ii) of the previous paragraph, and in order to enable thesecountries to settle their deficits with us in convertible currencies. We cannot afford to finance European reconstruction ourselves, but this adds the more weight to our urgent need that these countries should receive substantial financialassistance from the United States and from the international financial institutions.23. The United States and Canadian loans give us two years in which to reorganise before we have fully to pay our way in the world. Unless we can securesubstantial results by measures on the lines indicated in paragraph 21 above, wecan see no alternative to drastic cuts in our North American import programmes in 1948-50.Recommendations.24.   We therefore recommend that &apos;(i) The import programme for the first half of 1947 (firm) and for thesecond half of 1947 (provisional) be set up as in paragraphs 14-17above (set out in detail in paragraph 18 of Appendix B).   TheMinistry of Fuel and Power and the Ministry of Food dissent fromthe Treasury proposals in paragraphs 16 and 17 respectively,(ii) The export target should be provisionally put at 150 per cent, of 1938volume in the second half of 1947.(iii) The Balance of Payments Working Party should prepare reports for ministers on the long-term measures outlined in paragraph 21 above.Treasury Chambers.Great George Street, S.W. 1,12th October, 1946.
APPENDIX A.The Balance-Sheet for 1946.1. The import programme for 1946 is now likely to work out very close to-the programme approved by the Cabinet earlier in the year (all figures in  millions) : October estimates.

In the two big programmes food and raw materials -shortfall ofsupplies against previous programmes will have almost exactly been balanced by increases in price beyond what the Treasury had expected. But overall, these differences are not more than 2 or 3 per cent. The manufactured goodsprogrammes will slightly exceed expectations; supplies of certain industrial goodshave come forward faster than expected, but this will be partly offset by increaseduse for export. The slight excess in tobacco is attributable to the stocking decision in July. The petroleum increase over previous estimates is partly due to price increases, partly to the ration increase and partly to increased requirements of gas and fuel oil for the coal conversion programme. The indicated total is nowwithin 5 per cent, of the programme determined in January which must beregarded as a very satisfactory record for the import-programming procedure ina year of violent vicissitudes both in supply availability and in prices. The volumeof imports in 1946 will be 69 per cent, of 1938.3. The deficit for the year 1946 will be considerably below expectations.The following are the latest estimates, compared with those at the Aprilprogramme determination (adjusted to a comparable classification) : October estimates.     April estimates. m. &amp;m.Imports       ..................       -1,160 -1,120Overseas Government expenditure        ...      ...       -  320 -  380Exports and re-exports    ...      ...      ...      ...       4-   910 -I-   770Net invisibles, &amp;c................       4-95 -t-    40Deficit ............       -  475 -  690This prospective deficit is down far below previous expectation. Each of the items (other than imports) shows a more favourable trend :  (a) Net overseas Government expenditure will not be as large as expected,mainly because military expenditure is falling fast and substantialreceipts are expected from sales of surplus stores, but also because as top has been put on new commitments.(&amp;) There is an increase in expected income from exports and re-exports; theexpansion is attributable less to an increase in the Board of Trade&apos;estimates of recorded exports than to payments having been receivedmore promptly than expected.(c) The apparent improvement in &quot; net invisible income &quot; is less significant;much of it in fact represents an expansion of unidentifiable net receipts, which is becoming increasingly established as a firm element in our income from overseas.4. For the first half of the year (for which pretty firm figures are now available) the deficit may be put at  270 millions; for the second half, it may beforecast at  205 millions.
5. It is estimated that in the year we shall have drawn on the United StatesLine of Credit by  150 millions and on the Canadian credit by  160 millions; inthe first half of this year, we realised  45 millions of capital assets; we shall provide Argentina with  25 millions of free sterling this year, which will be adraft upon our gold and dollar reserves; the remaining  95 millions (to make thetotal of  4-75 millions for the year) will have been provided by growth in sterling balances and by other forms of borrowing or realisation of capital.6. At the end of 1946 (assuming the Argentines use their free sterling) our gold and dollar balances are estimated at  575 millions, and we shall still have some  925 millions outstanding on the United States and Canadian Lines of credit financial resources available of some  1,500 millions.APPENDIX B.1947 Import Programme.1. Departmental requirements have been examined by the ExchangeRequirements Committee and are summarised in the accompanying tables.Food.2. The basic requirements (Table II) are to maintain the average consump-tion standard of the year July 1945 to June 1946, but with the present Is. 4:d.meat ration; all available supplies of cereals, fats and fresh fish (except forluxury fish) are included in the basic programme. The required basic imports are put at  315 millions for the first half of 1947 and  317 millions for the-second half of 1947.   The following are the underlying assumptions : (a) Supplies from United Kingdom agricultural production will be lowerin 1947 than in 1946, particularly of eggs, bacon and milk for manu-facture. This results directly from the world cereal shortage; at bestthere can be no recovery in eggs until the last months of 1947 and inbacon until 1948.(b) Stocks in United Kingdom will be kept to a minimum level.(c) There will be no further change in prices beyond what is already known;broadly speaking, prices in this programme are 10 per cent, higherthan those in the April programme.3. The Treasury considers that allowing for likely lack of availability and^certain elements still under discussion, imports on the basic programme are unlikely to cost more than  295 millions in each half year. At the April pro-gramme determination, the Treasury estimated the cost of basic imports in thefirst half of 1947 at  240 millions. Of the increase now envisaged, some  35millions is attributable to price increases and some  20 millions to increasedquantities of imports required to maintain basic consumption.4. The supplementary requirements (Table III) are put at  56 millions forthe first half of 1947 and  72 millions for the second half. These representdesired improvements. The main items are fresh, dried and canned fruit and vegetables ( 23 millions and  39 millions in the two half years); meat, bacon, fishand poultry ( 20 millions in each half year); a large number of miscellaneousimprovements ( 13 millions in each half year). The only increase in rationedfood above the present level is a 1-oz. increase in the bacon ration, but this isdoubtful on supply grounds.5. If the supplementary programme were accepted in full, it woulddefinitely improve the variety of the diet and the quantities of fruit in particularwould be greatly increased; imports of citrus fruit would be 94 per cent, of pre-war and apples and bananas 70 per cent, and canned fruit imports would be50 per cent, of pre-war.6. World supplies of basic foods are unlikely to recover significantly in1947; increased supplies of sugar are unlikely to become available before 1948,eggs and bacon before 1949, dairy produce before 1950 and meat before 1951. The1946 cereals crisis has pushed livestock and dairy produce recovery back by atleast one year.   However, if the supplementary programme were accepted in
full and supplies were available to that extent imports of food into the UnitedKingdom in 1947 would be about 83 per cent, of 1938 compared with the 1946level of 70 per cent.7.. The effect of the protracted world food shortage is that our requirements from North America show no reduction. In the year 1947 40 per cent, of our requirements in value must be drawn from North America the same proportion as in 1946. On the figures as they stand, no progress will have been made towards a switch from the dear dollar sources of supply.Raw Materials.8. The raw material requirements (Table IV) submitted jointly by theBoard of Trade and the Ministry of Supply are  249 millions for the first halfof 1947 and  281 millions for the second half. The following are the under-lying assumptions : (a) Requirements are based upon the estimated capacity of industry to absorbmaterials within the possible limits of fuel and labour. The pro-gramme does not assume any planned switch in the pattern of industry.Paper and newsprint are provided in accordance with existingMinisterial decisions.   Certain items are still under discussion.(b) Requirements are at present contract prices which are some 12^ per cent.higher than those in the April programme.(c) The programmed amounts of certain materials (e.g., steel, timber, flax)may not be wholly available, and certain items are still under dis-cussion. Allowing for this, the Treasury considers that actual costof this programme is unlikely to exceed  235 millions in the first half of 1947 and  265 millions in the second half.(d) Provision is made to a total of  19 millions in the year 1947 for importsof raw materials for re-export.(e) Broadly speaking, stocks will be kept on a minimum basis; the pricesruling are now so high that it is considered undesirable to buy for stock, even if supplies are available.9. The raw material programme will still be dominated by world shortagesthroughout 1947. The problem is to obtain the supplies which industry needsrather than to choose between the best sources. There will be no possibility, in1947, of making a considerable switch away from North American sources ofsupply. In overall terms, however, the volume of raw material imports willbe appreciably higher than in 1946; it is estimated at 95 per cent, of 1938compared with 77 per cent, in 1946.Manufactured Goods.10.   The requirements (Table IV) submitted jointly by the Board of Trade. and the Ministry of Supply total  48 millions in the first half of 1947 and 50 millions in the second half as follows  (a) Machinery. Requirements  17-^ millions in each half year includingrequirements submitted by the Ministries of Agriculture and fuel and Power. This assumes a liberal issue of import licences. If manu-facturers wish to import machinery, they are normally allowed to doso in so far as like machinery is not readily available in the UnitedKingdom.(b) Industrial Goods. Requirements  10 millions and  11 millions in thetwo half years. The biggest items are textile yarns and manufac-tures, drugs, glass bottles and certain building materials.(c) Consumer Goods. Requirements are  11-1 millions in each half-year,but most of the goods in (e) and (/) below are consumer goods, sothis does not give the full picture of the import. These imports arepredominantly designed to ease the most pressing shortages, e.g.,furniture, clothing and footwear, watches, &amp;c. Imports of less essen-tial goods (e.g., bulbs, perfumes, &amp;c), are included from war-shatteredcountries. Broadly speaking, the programme contemplated for 1947is as much as can be got under the existing policy, i.e., that supplies from North America of less essential goods are obtained only undervery special circumstances, while our imports from war-shatteredEurope are restricted to the kinds and Quantities which can be bought without a corresponding necessity to buy from North Americaunder our non-discrimination commitments.
(d) Imports for Re-export.  3 millions in the first half year and  4 millions in the second half.(e) Token Imports. The Board of Trade estimates that the &quot; token &quot; importpolicy may cost up to  3 millions in each half year. This is for the admission of imports to a value up to 20 per cent, of pre-war from overseas manufacturers who had a pre-war trade in manufacturedand branded goods with the United Kingdom. The concession appliesat present to Canada, United States, Belgium and Switzerland, and discussions are in train for its extension to several other countries.Most of these imports are, of course, consumer goods, but some areindustrial goods.(f) Extra War-shattered Imports. The Board of Trade has included con-contingency figures of  3 millions in each half year for further importsfrom war-shattered countries.   These will be mainly consumer goods.11. The Treasury considers that these programmes have been drawn upconservatively; no adjustment for availability is needed. Certain items are still under discussion between the Treasury and the Board of Trade. The programmeprovides for a substantial increase of imports of manufactured goods in 1947;in 1946 the volume of these imports will be about 30 per cent, of pre-war andthe programme shown probably approaches 50 per cent, of 1938 volume. Butthis results partly from increased imports of machinery and increased importsof semi-manufactures and other goods for industry as Europe is able to supply,and the percentage in consumer goods is probably a good deal lower. The onlypolicy question is that of consumer goods. The present programme is in generalframed on a strict interpretation of essentiality. A more ambitious programmed could be obtained only by increasing purchases in North America or by a re-inter-pretation of our non-discrimination commitments which would permit increasedpurchases from the war-shattered countries without requiring a corresponding increase in purchases from North America. It must be emphasised that ournon-discrimination commitments seriously limit purchases which we should liketo make from Europe, and which we could afford to make were it not for thecorresponding dollar liability on like purchases from North America.Tobacco.12.&apos; The payments for tobacco will be  22 millions in the first half yearand  32 millions in the second half year, distributed between sources as inTable I. These figures are related to a purchase of -$185 millions from the1946 United States crop. When Ministers considered this in July, it was hopedthat this would provide for the purchase of increased stocks and so give greater flexibility to our buying programme in 1947. Prices at the United States auctions,however, are firm and it is unlikely that as much additional stock will be obtainedas was hoped. Stocks of United States tobacco will be down to about eight months&apos;consumption at the minimum point this year. This programme provides forthe purchase of as much as possible from Empire sources in 1947. The effects of these programmes will be to provide for distribution of cigarettes to the home market a 120 per cent, of the base year; for meeting requirements of the Army,N.A.A.F.I., &amp;c, and for commercial exports in 1947 at the rate of some 110 percent, of pre-war.Petroleum.13. The United Kingdom civil import programme of petroleum productsis now included as part of the import programme. The requirements are 26 millions in the first half year and  30 millions in the second half year.This is set out in Table V. The programme is framed on the following assumptions : (a) United Kingdom stocks will be held at levels agreed between the Ministryof Fuel and Power and the Treasury for each product.(&amp;) The existing petrol ration will be maintained but there will be some relaxation in restrictions on the use of kerosine.(c) Consumption of gas oil and fuel oil is increased to save coal.(d) Prices will remain at their present level.14. The Ministry of Fuel and Power estimates that removal of petrol rationing would cost an additional  5-8 millions in 1947, plus tanker freight.The overall cost in the year would thus be of the order of $30 millions. TheMinistry of Fuel and Power would also like a somewhat larger programme forthe import of paraffin wax.
Seeds and Animals.15. The requirements of seeds and cattle (Table IV) are estimated by theMinistry of Agriculture at  6^ millions in the first half of 1947 and  10 millions in the second half. To this must be added imports of horses and other animalsat the rate of  2 millions in each half year.Prices.16. The prices in the food and raw material programmes are 10-15 percent, in excess of the prices shown at the time of the April programme. Theseare price increases which are already in sight. The Ministry of Food and theBoard of Trade both consider that a further increase in prices is likely. A10 per cent, increase in the prices of the basic food programme and of the rawmaterial programme would increase the cost of our imports in the first half of1947 by over  50 millions. On previous occasions the Treasury has made a specialallowance for similar increases in price. On this occasion, however, no suchallowance will be made for two reasons : -(a) The export estimate has been made on price assumptions which theTreasury would regard as conservative in relation to the increases of import prices which are already forecast in the programme. In1947, the total size of our exports will be of the same order of magnitude as that of our imports, so that it would in any case be unnecessary to provide for more than a time lag element. In recent months our export prices have been tending to rise as fast as import prices.(b) It is not at all easy to determine a satisfactory figure to use; in somecases, e.g., rubber, there is likely to be a fall in price, and informedopinion on individual commodities is by no means unanimous aboutthe course of prices in 1947. The crucial element in an assessmentis the course of the United States internal economy where it is not clear that the inflationary tendency of the last year will continueinto 1947. Over a wide part of the field a small reduction in UnitedStates demand, both for foodstuffs and for raw materials, can havealtogether disproportionate effects upon prices.17. On balance this clearly injects an element of optimism into the balanceof payments estimates which are being used for this programme determination.Recommendations.18. The Treasury proposes that the import programmes for the two halvesof 1947 should be fixed as follows, the programme for the first half being firm and for the second half provisional : 	1st half 1947	2nd half 1947	(Firm).

The war-shattered countries are France and Colonies, Holland and colonies, Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Yugoslavia, Hong Kong, Malaya,Channel Isles. The ceilings for these imports may be raised if desired supplies are available.20. The quantities of imports on the recommended programme are shown inTable VI. The total programme will on this basis be 82 per cent, of the 1938volume compared with 69 per cent, in 1946.
APPENDIX C.Overseas Income and Expenditure (other than Imports).1.

See paragraph 2 below.See paragraph 3 below.United Kingdom imports included in&quot; imports &quot; and military oil included in overseas Government expenditure.Includes provision for unidentifiable receipts.-1-685   -t-1,2102. The export estimate is based upon estimates by the Board of Trade ofrecorded exports in 1947 of  1,300 millions, to which adjustment has been madeto represent receipts, and an addition for re-exports. The Board of Trade figure is related to man-power targets, and it allows for some increase over presentexport prices. The volume of exports is presumed to rise from the present level (third quarter of 1946) of say 110 per cent, of 1938 to 155 per cent, of 1938by the last quarter of 1947.3. Net. overseas Government expenditure is put at  175 millions in 1947.The principal items are military expenditure (net of surplus disposals) of some 100 millions, Germany (say  60 millions), and Far-Eastern rehabilitation(Burma, Hong Kong, &amp;c). Of the  175 millions for the year, some  50 millionsmay be regarded as &quot; normal,&quot; and  125 millions related to the terminal costs of the war.4.   The available funds for buying imports may be estimated as follows : Exports and re-exportsNet invisible income, &amp;c.Net Government expenditureAvailableAssuming that terminal costs of1st half 1947. m.+ 6154- 402nd half 1947. m.4-6854- 45Total 1947. m..+ 1,300-f    854-655- 954 560-730- 804-6504 1,385-   1754 1,210the war can properly be charged to borrowing,the amounts available from earnings for the purchase of imports may be put at 630 millions in the first half-year and  705 millions in the second half-year.Table I.1947 Import Programme.Geographical Distribution.(  millions.)

The programme provides far an increase in supplies of meat for manufacturing purposes, i.e., pies, sausages, &amp;c.Fish. If fulfilled, the whole programme would provide for 29-5 lbs. per head of fish (otherthan canned fish) in 1947, compared with 22-3 lbs. in 1946, 20-5 lbs. in 1945, 22-9 lbs. in 1938and 24-3 lbs. in 1937.Fresh Fruit and Vegetables. The total 1947 programme of citrus fruit is about 94 per cent,of pre-war imports. For apples the figure is 71 per cent, and for bananas 70 per cent. Importsof tomatoes and onions will also be back to nearly three-quarters of the pre-war level and itshould be added that there has also been an increase in home production of these vegetables.Dried Fruit.1 The programme provides for an increase of about one-sixth in the present levelof domestic consumption and an increase from 49 per cent, to 60 per cent, of the pre-war level for the manufacture of chocolate and confectionery.Canned Fruit. The programme would provide seven or eight tins of imported fruit per headin 1947.Canned Tomatoes-^he programme would provide two tins of canned tomatoes per headin 1947.Coffee.-The programme allows for an increase in the allocation to coffee roasters and essencemanufacturers of 35 per cent, above the current level.Cocoa.
