SECRETCP.(47)  274 COPY NO. ^1ST OCTOBER,  1947CABINETPETROL RATIONINGMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power in the course of considering how to put into effectour decision to abolish the basic ration with a view. to.eliminating &quot;pleasure&quot; motoring I find myself faced with theproblem of what &quot;to do about &quot;visitors&quot; to this country.2. What are normally, described as &quot;tourists&quot;i.e. visitors from the Dominions, Colonies, and foreignv  countries who bring cars to this country (and those thatbuy cars here for export after use in this country) have always been entitled to tho basic ration.   Since July, 1947,they have, in addition, been entitled to an allowancesufficient to take them from their port of ontry to theirfurthest destination and&apos;back.by direct route.3* Special &quot;Leave&quot; allowances have also been grantedto Servicemen55 and to civilians6.   With the exception of&quot;short leave&quot; allowances to Servicemen, to which was attached the proviso that no other means of transport was reasonably practicable^, the thought behind the granting of &quot;leave&quot;allowances, was to enable people to deal with matters of necessary personal business that had had to go by the board .during prolonged absences overseas.4* As regards &quot;tourists&quot; the President of the Boardof Trade is strongly of the opinion that present arrangements should continue to operate on tho grounds that they play aconsiderable part in the development of the tourist traffic,&apos;which is a most important hard currency earner.    He urgesthat petrol used in this way is,  in effect, a raw material for an invisible export and should therefore be granted thesame priority as that accorded to raw materials for visible-exports.s 300 miles of motoring in respect of &quot;end of war leave&quot;;up to 250 miles a quarter in respect of short leave where other means of transport are riot available or where travelling time &apos;would take an unreasonable time.having,regard to the periodof leave: . 450 miles a month (with a maximum of 900 milesa year) in respect of leave from overseas or embarkation leave&apos;- this last allowance has also applied to merchant seamen.e 450 miles a month (with a maximum of 900 miles a year) inrespect of leave from overseas.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
5* While accepting the force of this argument, itraises in ray mind the question whether civilians v/hose&quot;pleasure&apos;&apos; motoring is being stopped would not resentseeing &quot;tourists&quot; or Servicemen on leave, or civilians on overseas leave able to use cars for purposes from which theyare debarred.6. I therefore seek my colleagues&apos;  advice on whetherwo should continue;-   ,(a) the &quot;overseas11 leave allowance of petrol to Britishcivilian subjects - I think this would be hard\ to justify when residents .are&apos;deprived of allV&apos; &quot;pleasure&quot;- motoring.   Where .&quot;essential&quot; requirements are concerned - business&apos; or domestic - the visitorwill, of course, be able to apply in tho ordinary way for a supplementary allowances(b) any &quot;leave allowances&apos;&apos;1, to Servicemen - I think- this would bo hard-to. justify if (a) is rejected;.(c) the equivalent of the old basic ration and thoport to destination allowances &quot;to &quot;tourists&quot;;this is different but would need carefulexplanation to the public if (a) and/or (b)are rejected.E .
