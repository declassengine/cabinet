(47) 281Wth October, 1947CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1947-48 session memorandum by the Lord President of the council at their meeting on 20th March (CM. (47) 30th Conclusions, Minute 4)the Cabinet considered a provisional Legislative Programme for the 1947-48Session drawn up by the Future Legislation Committee (CP. (47) 79). TheCabinet agreed that the drafting of certain Bills included in this provisional programme should proceed and asked the Future Legislation Committee toconsider whether the Programme could not be lightened.2. The Future Legislation Committee have since carried out two reviews of the provisional Programme in consultation with the Ministers concerned,and they now submit for consideration by the Cabinet concurrently with thedraft of The King&apos;s Speech ,on the Opening of Parliament (CP. (47) 282) theProgramme set out in Groups I to VI of the Annex to this memorandum.3. The Committee have sought to draw up a Programme which will notimpose an undue strain on Parliament and on Ministers, and they have had regard tio the inroads which will be made on the time available for legislationbefore Christmas by the autumn Budget. They have accordingly been driven to reject or to relegate to Group VI (Bills to be introduced if time permits)several Bills for which the responsible Ministers were anxious to secure a definiteplace in the Programme. Even so the passage next Session iof the legislationincluded in Groups I to V is likely to tax severely the resources of the government machine and of Parliament, and the Cabinet should realise that a Programme ofthis size will leave little or no time for unforeseen emergency Bills and will rule out any prospect of restoring Private Members&apos; time.4. The following table shows how the numbers of Bills included inGroups I to IV of the proposed Programme for 1947-48 compare with thecorresponding numbers of Acts passed in the 1945-^46 and in the 1946-47Sessions : 1945-46 1946-47 1947-48Essential Bills       ......      21 10 11*Major Bills.........      17 12 7Medium-sized Bills......      14 9 11Minor Bills......   ^ ....      28 22 205. The Committee would draw the special attention of the Cabinet to thefollowing points :-(a) Iron and Steel Bill and Gas Bill. -The Cabinet have discussed thequestion of an Iron and Steel Bill on a number of occasions : the conclusion reached was that the Government should reaffirm their intention to introduce fullpublic ownership during the present Parliament, but that their supporters shouldbe warned that it was doubtful whether the necessary legislation could beintroduced in the 1947-48 Session.* This makes no allowance for legislation consequent on an autumn Budget.34348
The Future Legislation Committee have considered the matter further inconsultation with the Minister of Supply and the Minister of Fuel and Powerand have agreed to recommend to the Cabinet that an Iron and Steel Bill shouldnot be included in the Programme but that the Programme should include aGas Bill.A first draft Iron and Steel Bill on the lines originally approved by theCabinet has been prepared, but if the Bill were introduced in the 1947-48 session the work connected with it would make very heavy demands on the time of theMinister of Supply, his Parliamentary Secretaries and senior officials in theMinistry of Supply to the detriment of the discharge of the other importantduties for which the Ministry are responsible. Moreover, in view of the controversy which it would excite, the Bill would make large calls on the availableParliamentary time and its introduction might lead to a loss of steel productionin 1948 and to delays in the carrying out of the modernisation scheme, since itwould inevitably distract some of the energies of the managements of steel firms.On the other hand, the Gas Bill, which would follow the lines of theElectricity Bill, could be ready for introduction by January, and, in view of theco-operative attitude of the industry and the recommendations in the FfeyworthReport, is unlikely to arouse strong opposition in Parliament. Its passage wouldround off the work of socialising the fuel and power industries and enable much needed reforms in the modernisation of the distribution and production of gasto go forward,(b) Restrictive Practices BilL^In the provisional Programme this Bill was included amqrig fhe major Bills which were to be intro.duce.cl about Christmas.The Committee haye reached the Conclusion, however, that if the programme is to be kept within reasonable bounds; it is very doubtful whether this Bill canbe passed., apd they suggest that for the present it should be placed among the bills, to, be introduced if time permits.(c) Motorways Bill and Milk (Special Designations) Bill. The committee consider that in present circumstances, when capital investment must be restricted,little or no effective work could be carried out under the powers to be conferred by these Bills. They therefore propose that they should be omitted altogether from the Programme.(d) Trailing and Employment Bill. The Committee suggest that this Bill,whieh in the provisional Programme was included among the medium-sized bills to be introduced early in the Session, should be included among those to beintroduced if time permits, &apos; *(e) Legal Aid Bill and Legal Aid (Scotland) Bill. -The Committee were strongly pressed by the Lorql Chancellor to include a Legal Aid Bill among thelegislation to be introduced in the 1947-48 Session and to be mentioned inThe Fving&apos;s Speech. They are fully conscious of the merits of a measure ofthis kind but they cannot see how its inclusion as a Bill definitely to be introducedcan be justified when the Bills mentioned in (ft) and (4) above are heing relegatedto, the group of those tp be introduced if time permits. The Lord chancellor has suggested that the Bill might be specifically mentioned in The King&apos;s Speechas one to be introduced if time permits, but the Committee feel that there areobjections to this course.6.   The, Committee invite the QabinelH-(1) to approve Groups I to VI of the Annex to this memorandum as theLegislative Programme for the 1947-48 Session, and(2) to authorise the Legislation Committee to keep the Programme under constant review.H.
