SECRETCP. (U7)  2753RD OCTOBER.  19U7CABINETPRIORITIESMemorandum by the Prime. MinisterMy colleagues will recall that on 20th March lastI circulated, with their approval (CM. (4.7) 29th Conclusions,Minute 5),  a memorandum in which I asked that everythingpracticable should be done to meet all necessary requirements for the manufacture, installation and repair of certain kinds&apos;&apos;of equipment needed for- the expansion of our fuel and power resources (CP. (47) 92 (Revise)).2. This Directive has, I believe, been successful in ensuring that the rate of production of the items listed init is speeded up or at any rate prevented from furtherdeteriorating;    and in the special circumstances prevailinglast spring its issue was necessary for this purpose.     Atthe same time Its effectiveness must have placed difficultiesin the way of other forms of production which must now beregarded as no less essential.      I have received a report fromthe Minister of Agriculture which shows that the existenceof the Directive and the omission from it of agriculturalrequirements has had an adverse effect on his efforts toproceed with all speed with the action necessary to implement the expanded programme of home food production recently approved.      Other forms of production&quot; which play an essential part in- the new export programme may well be similarly affected.3* It will clearly be necessary for our present systemof priorities to be reviewed in the light not only of the newfood production and export programmes,  but also of such decisions on the investment programme as we may take in thelight of the Report by the Central Economic Planning Staffwhich is due to be submitted to Ministers at the beginning of next month;    and 1 propose that the Chief Economic. PlanningOfficer should be instructed to carry out such a review inconsultation with the Chairman of the Materials Committee andwith the Departments- concerned with a view to the submission of recommendations to Ministers as&apos; soon as possible.4* This review, however, will inevitably take some,little time.      In the meantime, I suggest that all allocatingauthorities for labour, materials and other essential supplies should be asked.to go as far as practicable to meet thenecessary requirements of agriculture and export as well asthose of the projects listed in CP. (4-7) 92 (Revise).COPY NO.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
5. If my colleagues agree with these proposals? itis for consideration whether an immediate announcement-should be made to the effect that- action is being taken on the lines suggested in the two preceding paragraphs.G.R.A.10, Downing Street,  S.W, 1.,3rd. October, 19U7.
