THIS  DOCUMENT 18  THE  PROPERTY OF   HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1947CONFIDENTIALCP. (47) 287October, 1947CABINETINTER-DEPARTMENTAL   ORGANISATION   FOR   HANDLINGBALANCE OF PAYMENTS  QUESTIONSNote by the Prime minister the appointment of a Minister for Economic Affairs involves some adjust-ment of the inter-Departmental organisation for handling balance of paymentsquestions which was described in CP. (47) 255. These adjustments are explained in the attached memorandum, which also describes the procedure which will be.adopted for interlocking the work of the three Committees announced in the.earlier paper.The procedure set out in the attached memorandum will be brought into-operation forthwith. This memorandum supersedes that attached to-C.P. (47) 255.C. R. A.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,^l^K October, 1947.INTER-DEPARTMENTAL   ORGANISATION   FOR   HANDLINGBALANCE OF PAYMENTS  QUESTIONS1. Subject to Ministers and to general supervision by the Official Committee&apos;on Economic Development, the Overseas Negotiations Committee and theExchange Requirements Committee will together provide the machinery for inter-Departmental work on balance of payments questions. The main tasks are to seekmeans of reducing the general- deficit in our balance of payments as a whole;within that general objective to make special efforts to correct our adverse tradingbalance with hard-currency countries; and to supervise the conduct of a largenumber of bilateral negotiations with a view to concluding trade and payments1agreements which will secure our essential supplies. These bilateral negotia-tions must be directed according to a single plan and with an eye on our totalneeds and resources. They must, therefore, be conducted against the background of a general programme for our balance of payments as a whole. At the sametime, the course or outcome of the several negotiations will necessitate changesin the general programme which must be accepted by the negotiators as a targetto which they should aim rather than a pattern to which they must conform.Thus, the framing of the general programme and the conduct of the particularnegotiations must be closely inter-locked. As a matter of practical administra-tion, however, it will not be feasible for the whole of this work to be carried through by a single inter-Departmental body. It necessarily involves more workthan a single Committee can handle, and the officials concerned with assessing;import requirements and export income are not in a position to assume respon-sibility for supervising the conduct of trade and payments negotiations. TheExchange Requirements Committee will therefore undertake the preliminary work of preparing a general picture of our prospective balance of payments as?,a whole, while the Overseas Negotiations Committee wall supervise the negotia-tions of trade and payments agreements with supplying countries. The procedure for interlocking the work of these two Committees is explained in the following-paragraphs.34372Copy No.
2. The task of the Exchange Requirements Committee will be to collect;and screen material for constructing, at regular intervalsi(probably of six months),-a balance of payments table. For this purpose the Committee will collect fromDepartments detailed information of (a) import requirements, on Government account and on private.account;&apos; (bj Government expenditure overseas; I(c) other invisibles, so far as they can be programmed; and Id) export income.This preliminary information will be made available at once to the overseas negotiations Committee.The Exchange Requirements Committee will then, in discussion with repre-sentatives of the Departments concerned, screen the information provided by departments under (a) to (c) above vith a view to reducing the prospectivedeficit in the general balance of payments, and easing the pressure on hard-currency supplies, by any means which can be agreed with the: Departmentsconcerned. In these proceedings they will also take account of any suggestions made to them by the Overseas Negotiations Committee regarding the difficultyof obtaining the desired supplies of any particular commodity, the need fordrawing particular supplies from sources outside the hard-currency area, orthe need for maintaining as part of our general commercial strategy certainiihpo-rts which would not otherwise be regarded as essential.31 When this screening process&apos; has been completed and a balance of payments;-fable has been prepared, the next step will be to formulate proposals for a balanceof payments programme, viz., proposals designed to eliminate or reduce the deficitdisclosed by the table. This is not a task which can be undertaken by theExchange Requirements Committee Itself; for (i) officials of importing Depart-ments Will not be able to commit their Ministers to accepting the cuts in Depart-mental programmes which will often be involved&apos; the collective decisions on thesematters Will have to be taken by Ministers, not officials; and (ii) at this stagefull account must be taken of variations or limitations in the general patternwhich may be dictated by the course of the trade negotiations conducted underthe supervision of the Overseas Negotiations Committee.The task of preparing proposals for a balance of payments programme will therefore be entrusted to a Working Party drawn from both the ExchangeRequirements Committee and the Overseas Negotiations Committee. ThisWorking Party will not include any of the claimants represented on the two committees and will comprise representatives of the following : Treasury.Board of Trade (C.R.T. Department).Central Economic Planning Staff.Economic Section of the Cabinet Secretariat.Bank of England.The Chairman of the Overseas Negotiations Committee will act as Chairman ofthis Working Party.4. The Working Party will submit their proposals for a balance of paymentsprogramme to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister for economic affairs. In the light of this advice, these Ministers will decide what recommenda-tions they will submit through the Economic Policy Committee to the Cabinet.5. When the balance of payments programme has been finally approved by ministers, the Exchange Requirements Committee will be responsible for pro-giessing its execution and for ensuring that expenditure on imports does notexceed the approved amounts.The approved programme will also be taken by the Overseas NegotiationsCommittee as the general objective at which it should aim in its supervision of the bilateral, negotiations for the conclusion of the trade and payments agree-ments required to secure the approved supplies. The course of those negotia-tions will probably dictate from time to time modifications in the general pro-grarnme. Details of the changes required will be communicated, as they arise,to the Exchange Requirements Committee, who will negotiate the consequentialalterations in Departmental import programmes. Where these changes call for fresh Ministerial decisions, the issues will be submitted to the Economic PolicyCommittee.
:: 285&apos;3, 6, Iii addition to the Exchange Requirements Committee and the overseas negotiations Committee, there is also the Exports Committee, under Board ofTrade Chairmanship. This Committee will be concerned mainly with the deter-iminatipn and&apos;progressing of export targets andi the. stimulation, of. production for export, The Overseas Negotiations Committee will look to this Committeefor assistance in increasing the availability of commodities which are of special importance to the conclusion of particular trade agreements, and for assistancein devising administrative measures to ensure that for the purpose of such agree-ments we can guarantee or direct exports of particular goods to, particularscountries.7. As stated above, these three Committees will work under the general supervision of the Official Committee on Economic Development, and the Chair-,men of the Committees will attend meetings of that Committee as, required.This does not mean, however, that all the recommendations of these committees will be submitted,&apos; to Ministers; through the Official Committee on economic development. There will be many occasions on which, for reasons of urgencyor otherwise, the Committees.&apos; recommendations can be submitted direct to ministers. These and other matters of procedure will be determined by the chairmen in consultation with the Chairman of the Official Committee onEconomic Development.8. The three Committees will be served by a full-time joint Secretariatdrawn from the Cabinet Office, the Treasury and the Board of Trade. Day-to-dayco-ordination of the work of the three Committees will be secured through this;common Secretariat and also through meetings of the three Chairmen.9. Details of the composition and terms of reference of the three Committees,are given in the Annex.ANNEX(i) Overseas Negotiations committee terms of ReferenceTo advise on the general principles on which to base trade and financial negotiations with overseas countries; and to supervise the conduct of such negotiations with particular countries.Com/positionT.
