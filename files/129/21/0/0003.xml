%h &apos; 26BIS.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(U7) 253 COPY NO.JV[_8TH SEPTEMBER, I9U7CABINETGAME prices memorandum &quot;by the Minister of PoodAt the meeting of the Cabinet on the 25th August, Iwas asked to consider the re imposition of maximum prices forgame birds.     ^C.W.(U7) 7kth Conclusions, Minute 272. I revoked the Game Bird (Maximum Prices) Order, 1942at the end of last June, because I was convinced that it wasserving no useful purpose.     I have carefully re-examined theposition in the light of our last discussion, and I am still ofthe definite opinion that no useful purpose wo\ild be served byan attempt to prescribe maximum prices for game birds. .3. The experience of the Ministry of Pood in two warshas shown that an attempt to fix maximum prices for.a food, thedistribution of which is not controlled, at a level well belowthe free market price, defeats its own object.     The principaleffect of such a maximum price order is to drive the food fromall the normal channels of trade, so that the ordinaryconsumer never gets the chance to buy it at all.h* This general proposition is confirmed by theexperience which we had with the Game Birds (Maximum Prices)Order, 1942.     The immediate effect of the Order was that thedespatch of game birds by land owners, farmers and shoots, tothe wholesalers in the markets of the principal towns,virtually ceased.     Many producers sold their birds direct tocatering establishments, clubs, and to a limited extent, direct to favoured customers.     Whilst practically no cases ofinfringement of the Order were discovered, it is most significant that the city wholesalers and retailers, who refused to pay more than the appropriate maximum price were unable to obtain supplies from producers;5. Thus the attempt to control the price defeated itsown object, because the game was not freely available.     Ihave no doubt that a considerable proportion was soldirregularly, but it is almost impossible to secure proof ofdealings of this sort without the employment of large numbersof enforcement officers, and accountants for this specialpurpose.     And if I used the resources of my enforcementorganisation to enforce price control on game birds, it would only be at the expense of their action to enforce Orderscontrolling the price of more essential foodstuffs for thegreat majority of our people.
6. The grouse season began,on 12th August, and thepartridge season on 1st September, and for a luxury seasonalproduct of this sort it is inevitable that the prices in .the  &apos;first fev; days of a new season should be high.     Retail prices for young birds at the beginning of the season were, I .understand, as high as 25/- each as compared with a maximum of6/- for both old and young birds under the Control Order.But the prices now have fallen.to 16/- for a very young birdand 12/6 for an old bird and may well fall lower as the season progresses.     Partridges are now selling at 12/6 for.young birds and 8/- for old as compared with a maximum priceof 5/- under the control order.7. But the great advantage of freedom from control isthat the birds are now back in the normal channels of trade.Wholesalers in the city markets and the reputable retain firmslike J. Sainsbury Ltd. have now been able to get supplies forthe first time since 19^+2.8. The alternative for the average consumer is not the choice between grouse at the controlled price of 16/- and the controlled price of 6/-s      The choice is between grouse beingobtainable for anyone who can afford it at 16/- or grousebeing virtually unobtainable through ordinary commercialchannels.9, Game birds can only be regarded as a luxury.     Onthe whole the purchase merely involves a transfer of income from people who are well able to afford the expense.     Thefact that such people are able freely to buy game birds at these high prices means that their demand for other productsat controlled prices, e.g. poultry, may be restricted, andthus free cheaper foodstuffs for the lower income groups.10. Becatise control will only drive game birds &quot;underthe counter&quot; and will not achieve any worthwhile object, i recommend my colleagues to maintain the present position bywhich the price of game is allowed to find its own level.J.S.Ministry of Pood,London, S.W.I.8TH SEPTEMBER, 1947
