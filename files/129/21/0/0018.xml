(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET .    ^  iCOPY NO.  3 /CP. (47)   26824th September,  1947-cabinet proposed EXTENSION OF HOURS IN THE COALMININGINDUSTRYMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power by letter dated 22nd September (Annex A) I conveyedthe decision reached at the meeting of 20th September(CM. (47) 76th Conclusions, Minute 7) to the Chairman of theNational Goal Board..     I regret that, in view of the last paragraph of his reply of 23rd September (Annex B)  it should benecessary to ask my colleagues to give further consideration tothe position now reached.2. It is clear that the National Union &apos;of Mineworkersdid not feel themselves able to accept the proposals which.had already.been put to them by the Government and twice rejected by their Executive Committee (see Annex C).    In the light ofthe National Union of Mineworkers&apos;  attitude the Board&apos;s field of negotiation was confined to the possibility of securing oneor other of the following objectives:(a) longer shifts at those pits or in those areas where this was mutually agreed to be practicable and themen were willing to work them;(b) voluntary Saturday working at other pits and in other areas with the bonus, not&quot; linked to six shifts but with safeguards against the danger of increasedabsenteeism through the week.3. The tentative agreement reached between the Board andthe Union contemplated that advantage should be taken of one orother of these possibilities as local conditions might dictate.It also embodied safeguards,  so far as was practicable,  againstthe dangers foreseen by the Government and the Board in theUnion&apos;s proposals for Saturday working on a national basis.4* Thus the full implementation of the Five Day WeekAgreement was to be a condition precedent to the working of extra, hours either by way of longer shifts or Saturday working at any pit.      This meant that, before the opportunity ofadditional earnings at overtime rates was conceded,  the menat the pit concerned would, have been required:
(a) to accept such increases&apos;in stints&apos;as were deemedappropriate and decided or awarded in accordancewith the conciliation procedure;(b) to find ways and means of disciplining habitualabsentees in order to raise - the level of attendanceto some predetermined level mutually agreed betweenthe Divisional Goal Board and the Area Executive ofthe Union as &quot;satisfactory&quot; in respect of the areaof pit concerned.5* Only when these pre-requisites had been satisfiedwould consideration have been given to the working of extrahours at overtime rates,  and the ,Board proposed to safeguardthemselves against tbje -possibility of backsliding by reservingan unfettered right tp .cancel any arrangements for extra hours &apos;after a month&apos;s trial.6. I would not seek to minimise the defects of an agreement on these lines, but unless the Government can find means of persuading the miners to retreat from the position.they havetaken up on the inviolability of the Five Day Week-Agreement,the alternative is a complete breakdown in negotiations for anextension of working time in the mines, with, the possibilityharsh recriminations betweeji the Government and the Union andthe incalculable harm which&apos;would be done to the drive toSecure the full.output possible in the Five Day Week.7* We have secured the co-operation of the Union to thefull extent that they believe they con g3 rry their rank and filewith them.      If we accept this measure of co-operation it conresult in on agreement which the National Goal Board believewill /benefit cool output.      If we reject it we shall have rejectedwhat the Union regard as the only practicable means of responding-to the Government&apos;s appeal and I fear they will not hesitate to join with the Board in saying so. x8. Finally,  I would submit that,  constitution-ally,  it isfor the. Government to state the national interest to the Boardof a socialised industry (in this case the urgent need for morecool without.&apos;inflation of costs) but&apos; it is for the Board of the socialised industry, after consultation with appropriate workersorganisations, to say by what means the objective can best be attained.      Unless.this principle is adhered to the Governmentwill lay itself open to d&apos;charge of unwarrantable interferencewith an industrial question which Parliament intended should fallexclusively within the Board&apos;s sphere.E.S.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1.20th September,  1947.
ANNEX A1 /2.Ministry of Fuel and Power,7* Millbank,London, S.W. 1 .22nd September,  1947Dear Hyndley,I am writing to let you know the result of theGovernment&apos;s consideration of the proposals arising fromthe discussions between the National Goal Board and theNational Union of Mineworkers for securing an increased output of coal by an extension of the hours of work inthe coal industry.     The Government do not regard theseproposals as adequate to meet the present grave situationand adhere to their view that, additional output shouldbe sought by the working of an additional half-hour onthe existing working days wherever this is possible, and &apos;that, where resort is had to Saturday working, theworkers should not be entitled to the attendance bonusunless they had worked the full number of six shiftswhere required tinder the new arrangements.Yours sincerely,(Signed)      E. SHINWELLLord Hyndley,  G.B.E.,The National Goal Board,Lansdowns House,Berkeley Square,W.1.
ANNEX BNational Goal Board,Lansdowne House,Berkeley Square,London, W.1 .23rd September, 1947My dear Minister,I have your letter of September 22nd about thecurrent discussions between the Board and the NationalUnion of Mineworkers for an extension of working hours.Throughout these discussions, which were startod bythe Government, we have realised that their purpose was tosecure an increase in the output of coal, whilst leaving the Five-Day Week Agreement inviolate and avoiding anyfurther increase in costs.We recognised,  of course, that the way in which thiswas to be achieved was a matter of concern to the Governmentand we have paid careful regard to such indications of theGovernment&apos;s attitude as -we have received.Subject to this, we have carried on. discussions withthe N.U.M., as we were requested -and entitled to do, with-aview to making the best possible arrangement and you havebeen kept &quot;fully informed.Your latest letter makes it clear that the Governmentare unwilling to countenance a settlement except one on lines which, as you know, the N.U.M. have twice rejected.We are due to meet the Negotiating Committee of theUnion this afternoon.     Inevitably,  discussions will be broken off and unless they are promptly resumed as a resultof some new initiative by the Government the Board will haveno alternative but to issue an announcement making it clearhow the situation has arisen and disclaiming responsibilityfor it.Yours sincerely,(Signed)      HYNDLEYThe Rt.Hon. Emmanuel Shinwell, M.P.
National Union of Mineworkers,5, Westminster Bridge Road,London, S .E.1 .11th September,  1 947The Rt.Hon. Emmanuel Shinwell, M.p,.,Minister of Fuel, and Power,7, Millbonk, S-W.1.Dear Mi1. Shinv/ell,The National Executive Committee at its meeting heldin London yesterday considered your letter of the 25thultimo and noted the refusal of the Government to acceptthe Union&apos;s. proposal for Saturday working.     The Committeealso considered the original proposal of the Government thattho daily hours should be extended by half-an-hour for alimited period, and the further proposal made duringsubsequent discussions that, should Saturday working be reintroduced,. payment should be at overtime rates but the bonus payment would be conditional on working the fullnumber of six shifts where required under the new arrange-ments.The Committee re-affirmed its view that an extensionof the.working day would not bring about any&quot; appreciableincrease in production.     Tho cycle of operations at manypits, particularly those in the high producing areas wouldnot permit of any extension of the length of the workingshift and if such a change were attempted it would only leadto overlapping of shifts and consequent chaos.&apos;   Further,the Committee had. to have regard to the fact that whilstunderground workmen would be entitled to an overtime payment in respect of the additional half-hour to be worked, surface workers, who, under the Five Day Wo ok Agreement could becalled upon to work a shift of 8-g- hours (exclusive of mealtimes) would receive no additional payment.     The conditionsof surface workmen under the Five Day Week Agreement andthe work they can be called upon to perform,  however, is related to a. coal winding shift of 7a&quot; hours, and to suggestthat&apos; the additional work involved in winding coal for anadditional half-hour per day should be carried out withinthe present provisions of the Five Day Week agreement would not be acceptable to surface workmen generally andwould only lead to further dislocations of output as aresult of stoppages throughout the various coalfields.      Inall the circumstances,  therefore, the Committee could not see its way clear to recommend acceptance of this proposalto the rnemb ership.With regard to the second proposal, various membersof the Government have from time to time insisted that thereis no desire on their part to violate the principles of theFive&apos;Day Week Agreement.     Acceptance &apos;of the. Government&apos; proposal,  however, would mean, in the case of many workmenwho are physically incapable of working more than fiveshifts each week (and in this connection it must be appreciated that&apos; there are approximately 150,000 personsemployed in the industry who are 50 years of age and over),a reduction equivalent to a shift&apos;s earnings per week as annex C
compared with the present position.      (it is recognised cfcourse that, the reduction would he only seven-tenths of a,shift in the-case of a workman who worked one of the fiveshifts on Saturday in respect of which he received time-and-a-half) .     We are unable to estimate what the loss would &quot;bein the&apos; case of a workman who is at present in receipt ofthe national minimum because it is not clear from theGovernment^ proposals whether the national weekly minimum&apos;would apply in respect of the number of shifts to be workedby a workman in any given week,- and if this were the casowhat proportion of the 7i:r shifts&apos;  earnings to -be paid to a.workman working six shifts wouid.be regarded as overtimeand payable in excess of the minimum.The position is further complicated by the fact thatin those pits where workmen would be called upon to workevery Saturday,  qualification for the bonus would be dependant upon their working six shifts every week whereas in other pits where arrangements necessitated working onlyeleven shifts, a fortnight workmen would qualify for the bonus by working only* five shifts every other week.In addition, you will appreciate that the Union&apos;representatives, when negotiating the Five Day WeekAgreement,, had some doubt as to the reasonableness of the refusal of&apos; the Ministry and, later,- the Board,  to accept theprinciple that shifts lost through genuine sickness shouldnot serve to disqualify a workman for receipt of the&apos; bonuspayment in any week.     The Union&apos;s representatives onlyaccepted this situation when they realised theadministrative difficulties involved and because of thegenuine desire of all parties to introduce a reform whichwas to benefit the overwhelming marjori-tyof tho workmen inthe&apos;industry.     The National Executive Committee,  however,could not justify the introduction of any system which would still further penalise workmen- who were genuinely sick by insisting that they must work six days out of every sevento qualify for the bonus payment.The National Executive Committee intends to take stopsto ensure that the terms of the Five Day Week Agreement are fully implemented but is   apprehensive of this in itselfbeing sufficient to meet the critical position insofar ascoal production is concerned.     The Coivar.ittee therefore decided to seek an early meeting with the National coal board to further discuss the matter and is prepared toexamine any new proposal that may be forthcoming from either the Board or the Government.For its part, the Committee will suggest the workingof systematic organised overtime, -which as you know isprovided for in the Five Day Week Agreement.   This proposal will enable each Division or, if necessary,  each collieryto decide, having regard to local circumstances, in whichway it can&apos; make a contribution towards increased productionand it is intended, to discuss this proposition with theNational Coal Board at the forthcoming meeting.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    A.L.
