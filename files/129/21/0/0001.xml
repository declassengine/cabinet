(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(U7)  251 COPY NO.5TH SEPTEMBER,  191-1-7CABINETINDIAN POOD situation memorandum by......the Lord President of the council the Indian High Commissioner came to see me onThursday, i+th September.      I was accompanied by theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of food.      The purpose of the High Commissioner&apos;s visit was tolodge with the United Kingdom Government an earnest appeal from India for immediate help in the very grave food situationwhich confronts India at this moment.2. A similar appeal was addressed to us &quot;by theGovernment of India through the Viceroy in June last.After prolonged and careful examination between the ministers directly concerned, it was decided that there was nothing wecould do to help India then, despite our anxieties about thesituation.     The Government of India now raise the questionagain and point out that in many parts of the country stocksof foodstuffs available for distribution to maintain the ration are so low that they estimate a breakdown of rationingto be inevitable at any time after the middle of this month.At the beginning of November their main rice harvest begins tocome in and they hope to be able to get the proceeds of thisharvest into the rationing system by the middle of November.Their immediate crisis therefore lies in the next two months.They appeal to us most earnestly to do anything we can to helpwithin this period, which means the diversion of suppliesunder our control either already at sea or within a fairlyshort haul of India.3. The parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of food said that she could see no immediate way of helping indian that direction.      She suggested, however, that India might consider buying 50,000 tons of American wheat which had been allocated to us but which on account of our dollar stringencywe were not taking up.      The High Commissioner said that hewould report this suggestion at once to%his Government.India&apos;s own dollar difficulties were mentioned but the HighCommissioner thought that his Government: had at disposal some25 million dollars of which they might be prepared to use somefor this purchase.     He observed, however, that even if this quantity of wheat was immediately bought for India, it could hardly reach Indian ports in time to assist them in theirpresent difficulty, and urged once more that help should beprovided from some other source.     The Government of India&apos;s
proposition was that any such help should be regarded as a loan, which they would undertake to repay at an early date;and the High Commissioner1s own view was that repaymentshould be possible before the end of the winter.h. We assured the High Commissioner of our earnestdesire to help if it was at all possible for us to do so,but emphasised that our own difficulties were worse than ever.5. The question of India buying the 50,000 tons of american vi/heat referred to above, the only suggestion wewere able to make at the meeting, is being examined separatelyby the Treasury, the Commonwealth Relations Office and theMinistry of Food.     We have of course asked India to reduce,or at least not to increase, her dollar expenditure.The sum of $25 millions to which the High Commissionerreferred we suppose to have been that part of India&apos;s&quot;Post-War Dollar Fund&quot; of 0kO millions which has not yetbeen spent.      Our understanding is, however, that this sumis already fully committed for capital and reconstructionexpenditure.      The 50,000 tons of wheat would cost about$5 millions f.o.b.6. As regards the High Commissioners plea for stillmore urgent assistance, I undertook that we would, despiteour own difficulties, examine urgently whether there wasanything we could do.      The, Departments concerned have this in hand and I have no recommendation to put before mycolleagues at this -moment.     I feel, however, that theyshould be aware of what has passed;    possibly theDepartments concerned may be able to report verbally to theCabinet.H.M.Great George Street, S.W.I.5TH SEPTEMBER,  1947
