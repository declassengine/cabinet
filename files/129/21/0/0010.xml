F     60FINAL DRAFT IIICOMMITTEE OF EUROPEAN ECONOMIC CO OPERATIONGENERAL REPORT(i)PREAMBLEIn response to Mr. Marshall&apos;s speech on 5th June, the   sixteenparticipating countries have met in Paris for the purpose of developingan economic recovery programme for Europe and of determining the manner and extent to which by their individual and collective efforts they can bring about the achievement of that programme.In the report which follows,  the participating countries have defined the economic and financial problems facing europe and have described and discussed 1) the production targetswhich they have set for themselves,&apos; 2) the steps which arebeing taken and will be taken to bring about internalstabilisation; 3) the measures which the participating nations will take through combined or co-ordinated action to solveproduction problems, provide for the free&apos; and efficient flow ofgoods and labour,  and ensure the full use of European resources;and k) the problem presented by the participating countries *balance of payments deficit with the American Continent.The circumstances in which the report has been drawn upgive it the character of an initial report.    It was impossible ina few weeks to give a complQtely detailed and exact accountof the economic situation of sixteen European countries, of theserious difficulties confronting them, of the action which theyhave decided, both individually and collectively, to take,or of the import requirements necessary for the execution of sucha programme.    So far as possible however the replies to thequestionnaires which were sent to each of the participating governments have been subjected by the Committee to a criticalexamination.To deal with any.amendments which appear desirable it may-be necessary to publish supplementary reports which will inparticular take account of the development of. the international economic situation..The Committee however,thought it necessary not to delay in publishing the results of its work to date.    The critical situation in Europe compels it to adopt this course.The participating countries recognise that their economicsystems are interrelated and that the prosperity of each of themdepends upon the restoration of the prosperity of all.    they further recognise that the objective of a sound and healthyeconomy for Wootern Europe can best be achieved by sustainedcommon efforts directed specifically towards the production ofscarce commodities, the full use qf available resources and the achievement of internal financial and economic stability.To this end, the participating countries have undertaken to use all their efforts to develop their national production in order to achieve the production targets set out inthis report.    Each is also determined to carry out vigorouslythe internal measures which are necessary to create or maintain its own internal financial stability and confidence in its currency and credit. m^   ,
The participating countries have further agreed to set upa joint organisation which will review the progress made incarrying out the recovery programme.The participating countries fully recognise that thepresent progress towards European recovery could not have been achieved without the generous and substantial aid furnished tocertain of the European countries by the United States.     Asevents have turned out, that aid has not proved sufficient toenable the European nations to re-establish their productionand trade on a sound and healthy basis.      It should, therefore,be understood that the commitments here undertaken cannot befuHy met nor can European recovery be finally and permanentlyeffected without additional external aid.This report is in no sense a &quot;shopping-list&quot; of the goods which the participating countries need from the United States.g?he import requirements which a-r*e noodod to onrry out theEuropean recovery-programme are stated--in global tormsj but the,purpooo io to Ghew tha size^ of tho problem,-Tho report do-1* **designed primarily as a close and careful analysis of themaladjustment which has resulted from the war, and an examination of what the participating countries can do for themselves and for each other to work towards a lasting solution.The report shows the expected deficit of the participating countries and Western Germany in their trading relations, withthe American Continent and the non-participating countries.This illustrates the size of the problem, but it must be understood that the participating countries neither ask norexpect special aid from the United States to the full amountof that deficit.      Some of the deficit can be filled throughprivate financing, investment or the use of any suitable assets stillavailable to the participating countries and some through the international bank for Reconstruction and Development.     The amount of aid which each country needs in order to make its full contribution to the european recovery programme is not specified in this report.In presenting this report in response to Mr. Marshall&apos;suggestion, the participating countries believe that theprogramme of concerted action which it sets forth marks the advent of a new era of European economic co-operation.Through the achievement of this programme, by their own efforts and with such support as the United States may feel it properto supply, the nations of Europe can march forward towards the attainment of that essential economic well-being which is thebest assurance of peace and happiness.
FINAL DRAFT IIICOMMITTEE OF EUROPEAN ECONOMIC CO-OPERATIONGENERAL REPORTCHAPTER IHistorical introduction.        The 16 participating countries with Western Germany have atotal population of 270 millions.     Most of them in normal times[enjoyed a standard of living somewhat inferior to that of theUnited States and Canada, but higher than that of any other large[aggregate of population in the world.     They were able to do thisfirstly because they had brought their industry and agriculture toa high standard of efficiency and secondly, because they derived alarge income from international trade and commerce as well asinvisible exports-such as tourism, shipping, banking and insuranceservices and the foreign investments which they had gradually[built up over centuries.2. As trading nations these countries were predominant,had nearly one-half of the world&apos;s international trade $    t:Theythey ownednearly two-thirds of the world&apos;s shipping tonnage;    and their income from foreign investments and other invisible exports was sufficient to purchase nearly one-quarter of their imports from therest of the world.      This income from trade enabled them to buy the raw materials needed by their industrial plants and the food and feeding stuffs required to sustain their population and agriculture.3-        The industrial structure of Western Europe was based uponcoal, steel and chemicals, and its output of these products in theperiod just before the war was slightly greater than that of the limited States.     Every part of this machine depended upon the[efficient working of the other parts and none of the Westernruropean countries was in a position to organise its industry[effectively without the support of the others.A high level of agricultural production was attained, butiiis was made possible only by the intensive use of fertilisersfnd imported feedingstuffs.     The density of agriculturalopulation was many &quot;dimes greater-than that &amp;i  Nofc&amp;hjjnerica, and the countries with the most efficient agriculturefere those which made most use of imported supplies./5.The following table shows the comparison with the United States:-Pre-warPopulation(millions)Percentage of World (1938)Imports   ; ExportsU.S,A. 131.7Participating1 Countries 205.9[Western Germany 1^0.1&quot;oTT&quot;i+0.89.1+ShippingTonnagellf.258.66.8h-13.230. k10.0++ Whole of germany the figure for the participating countriebetween them,    If only the trade of the 1includes tradecountries as a wholewith the outside world is taken, their imports were over three times those of the United States, their exports some 30% higherthan the exports of the United States.
The exceptional degree of specialisation in the industry andiculture of the participating countries was responsible foreir high standard of living, but it contained certain elementsweakness.      The machine was highly developed and ,delica.tei  .depended for its efficient working upon the smooth working ofernational trade and the uninterrupted flow of goods and services,war of 1939-1945 destroyed this process, and a breakdown occurredch altered the whole basis of the economy of Europe.     As timesed, it also became apparent that, even when the war had come to end, the vital flow could not immediately be resumed.     Alliedtory had been obtained only at the price of the temporarytruction of some of the centres of production and the dislocationthe transport system, and by the sacrifice of shipping andeign investments, upon which the essential imports had sovily dependedThese losses and sacrifices had weakened the economicucture of the sixteen countries and their effect was aggravatedmany other factors.      The agriculture, trade and industry ofopean countries had been twisted out of shape by their own warort or by policies imposed by armies of occupation.      Greatbers of workers were displaced or deported.      Oversea importers,rived of the normal flow of supplies from Europe, transferredincreased part of their trade to the United States.      The mainrces of supply of these sixteen countries were laid waste;devastation in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union cut off a&quot;or source of food and timber;    the extension of the war intoth East Asia upset Europe&apos;s trade balance with the United Statesch was partly financed by exports from South East Asia, and inItion led to a double loss to the European food supply;    for thentries of South East Asia not only became incapable of sendingir normal share of food exports to Europe but required andained food which would normally have come to Europe.In 19h7 Europe was perhaps more denuded of resources than attime in its history.      There was a shortage of all basicerials:    of fertilisers to renovate the soil, of availableour, of raw materials and equipment to quicken production,e industries began to run down for lack of facilities for alltemporary repair.After the shortage of.food and decline in the productioncoal and steel was perhaps the hardest blow to the economyurope.      Immediate rehabilitation was made difficult;    urgentstic needs pushed aside the claims of the export trade therebyjfther reducing capacity to buy vital industrial equipment abroad.HBests in occupied countries, and even more in the UnitedI^tegdom, were over-cut.      Timber exports from North Eastern Europefell off sharply, with serious consequences for xne basicMfcstries of Western Europe.Meanwhile prices had risen and, although no inflationparable to that of 191h-l8 had occurred, the problem ofGlanced budgets and rising prices was serious in many countries;ome it was catastrophic.      The shortage of gold and dollarslarge numbur of European countries brought about thelopment of bilateral agreements, which promoted a limitedval of trade, but could not provide the steady and universalth which would have taken place if conditions had allowed arn to the normal multilateral system.
/This10..   To sum up, the difficulties of the participating countriesat the end of a war fought over three continents were due to thefollowing main causes:-(i) Physical devastation and disruption in Western europe and in the principal food and timber-producing zones of Eastern Europe which, together with the dislocation of the European transport system, caused a temporaryparalysis of production in Western Europe, includingGermany;(ii) prolonged interruption of international trade,- which,occurred simultaneously with the loss of income frommerchant fleets and foreign investments, led to the exhaustion or diminution of dollar funds in the sixteencountries at a moment when many vital needs could bemet only from dollar sources;(iii)human and finanoial strain and exhaustion resultingfrom six years of war or enemy occupation;(iv)   internal financial disequilibrium which is the inevitable result of a long war;(v)   in south east Asia, the shortage cf supply of food and raw materials which were vital to the European economy, both for direct consumption and as earners of dollars;(vi)   the abnormal increase of population in certain areas resulting fromthe war-time movements of peoples.11. The scale of destruction and disruption of European economic life was far greater than that which Europe had experienced in thefirst World War. Industrial production in Belgium, Prance andthe Netherlands was reduced to 30 - hO per cent of pre-war, and in italy to only 20 per cent; production of bread grains fell to only two-&apos;thirds of pre-war; 300,000 freight cars had been destroyed outof a&apos; total of 2,000,000 and 800,000 freight cars were damaged. Thedevastated countries had to? start again almost from the beginning.12,   Nevertheless recovery proceeded well - indeed, much faster than after the end of the first World War.    Eighteen months afterthe end of fighting in Europe, industry and transport were movingagain vigorously and the work of reconstruction was getting underway.   This was made possible by the efforts of the European caantrfe&apos;3themselves,-;with generous assistance from the United States andother countries and from U,N.R.R.A.    So successful were these efforts that by the end of 19*4-6 industrial production in Belgium.Prance and $he Netherlands had recovered to&apos;85 - 95 per cent of the&apos;Pre-war level, whilst Italian industrial production was back to 60;per cent of pre-war levelV,    In the United Kingdom the process ofI demob iii sat ion of the war economy had been accomplished smoothlyiand the pre-war level of national output had been.fully restored.[In the Scandinavian countries production was steadily rising.     Indeed, the[participating countries as a whole&apos; had, made a good start on their task.13.   This improvement was not maintained in the winter of 19h-6-7.;The European economy, still at the convalescent stage, suffered a[most serious setback as a result of the continued shortage of coal,-the increased cost of primary products and the prolonged world[shortage of food and other essential commodities.
This crisis was intensified by the exceptionally severe winter and the drought which followed.     Further advance from the levels of autumn 19I4.6 would, in any case, have &quot;been difficult in view of the continued inability -of the German economy tosupply the coal and other products upon which so much of Europe1seconomic life depends.     But the failure of production to recoverin other devastated parts of the world and the consequentdevelopment of further shortages, and further price increasescreated additional problems for Europe which threatened thewhole basis of the recovery which had been made so far.     the credits which many countries had obtained in the early post-war period, were becoming exhausted, and the upsurge of recoveryhad used up the stocks which countries had managed to retainor acquire after the liberation,111.   Ba^ly in 1947,- indeed, it became clear that the effect ofthe war had been to destroy the balance between the productivepower and resources of the Western&apos; Hemisphere and those of therest of the world.     The effect of this disequilibrium was shown most clearly in the surplus in the United States balanceof payments which was then running at the rate of $10p000 millions a year.     In order to maintain the progress which had so far been achieved, the European countries were bound to maintain thevolume of their imports from the American Continent atincreasing cost.     This process inevitably led to a rapiddepletion of gold and dollar reserves.     The effects of this process reach far beyond Europe and threaten the foundations of the world economy.     But Europe was affected most acutelyand urgently because of the dissipation of her financialand physical resources during Athe.war.15*   By the early summer of 19U7, the earlier hopes of a rapid and sustained recovery from the effects of the war had receded.latfetitetaSy   m  most European countries in fact recovered wellfrom the winter crisis, and the levels of the previous autumnhad been generally restored by the middle of the year.     Butthis-improvement was being maintained only at the cost ofdepletion of financial reserves.     When these were exhausted, the peoples of Europe would be threatened with an indefiniteprolongation of insecurity and lower standards of living^unless drastic steps were taken to arrest the process, Europeanproduction could never play its proper part in redressing the growing unbalance of the world economy,16.   On 5th June, 1947. Mr, Marshall, the United states secretary of State, delivered a speech at Harvard University.He said:        -&quot;Europe&apos;s requirements for the next three orfour years of foreign food and other essential products -principally from America - are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must have substantial additional-help or face economic, social and politicaldeterioration of a very grave character,.,. Before, however,the United States can proceed much further in itsefforts to alleviate the situation and help start theEuropean world on its way to recovery, there must be some agreement among the countries of Europe as to therequirements of the situation and the part these countriesthemselves will take in order to give proper effect to whatever action might be undertaken by this Government.It would be neither fitting nor efficacious for this/Government
Government to undertake to draw up unilaterally a programmedesigned to place Europe on its feet economically...  The ini-tlative.., must come from Europe,     The role of this country should consist of friendly aid in the drafting of a*European programme and of later support of such a programme,so far as it may he practical for us to do so.     Theprogramme should he a joint one agreed to by a number, ifhot all, European Nations&quot;.On 12th June, Mr. Marshall explained that he had in mind the entire continent West of Asia - and including both theUnited Kingdom and the Soviet Union,17.   On 16th June, Mr, Bevin, the British Foreign Secretary,visited Mr. Bidault, the French Foreign Minister, in Paris,     they agreed to seek to associate the Soviet Government with their initiative in framing a reply to Mr. Marshall, and discussion between Mr. Bevin, Mr, Bidault and Mr, Molotov started in Parison 27th June.     Much to the regret of the Governments of Franceand the United Kingdom, agreement could not be reached^,18,   On 3rd July Mr, Bevin and Mr. Bidault decided themselvesto issue invitations to all other European countries (exceptSpain) to attend a conference in Paris in order to prepare areport for presentation to Mr. Marshall in response to his HarvardSpeech,     In addition to the United Kingdom and France, fourteencountries, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Iceland, Ireland,.Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden,Switzerland and Turkey, accepted the invitation and sent delegates to the Conference.     The remaining European countriesdecide.fi.inot too take part, and the Conference was therefore unable todeal with the European problem as a whole.     It was hoped, however-that the non-participating countries would be able to associate themselves with the work of the Conference at a later stage.19.   The Conference opened in Paris on 12th July under thechairmanship of Mr, Bevin,     Within four days the Conferenceadjourned, having set up a Committee of Economic -Co-operationprepare a report.     The Committee of Co-operation at once set upTechnical Committees covering food and agriculture, fuel and power,iron and steel and transport,     T.ater, committees were formedto deal wi *h tiinbett.&apos; and manpower, together with a Balance of Payments[CkJimnittee and a Committee-of Financial Experts to examine means of reiroviag(financial obstacles to intra-European trade.     It was deciaeu 00prepare a report for the four years 19U8-51, and exhaustiveinformation in the fields covered by the Committees was collected from the sixteen participating countries.     Most of this information had been collected by the end of the first week in August36.2(5,   At the. outset the Committee of Co-operation fledidedc-iboirequestthe ComnianderB--in-Chief&apos; o  the occupied zones.A Germany.to givefiimi^ajp information- afrout the-ia? bokbs as ttag -tteang requested fromparticipating countries. At a Mater stage a statement8&quot;&quot; was prepared as a gui.de to the Technical Committees in the treatmentpf the information submitted,at   See Appendix A,*5e   Reproduced in Appendix B,
21&apos;.   As the work of the Committee of Co-operation was proceedingthe foreign exchange crisis continued to gather momentum.There was a rapid increase in the rate of exhaiistion of Europe&apos;financial reserves.    On the 20th August, the,United Kingdom was forced temporarily to suspend the transferability of sterlinginto United States dollars; on the 28th August the Government of france  announced the suspension of all dollar imports exceptcerealss coal and certain other supplies of similar essentiality;at the &quot;beginning of September, the Italian Government was obligedto suspend purchases of coal, oil and other basic supplies.    Actionon similar lines has been taken or is likely&apos; to become necessaryin the near future in most of the participating&apos;countries.22.   At the moment at which this Report is published many of the participating countries have already reached the point at whichthey are forced by lack of foreign exchange to restrict their imports of the fuel and raw materials which are indispensablefor their industrial and agricultural production and to cut their imports of food to a point at which industrial efforts can nolonger be sustained at the level required to enable recovery to.take place,    From the devastation of war Europe recovered well.But that recovery is now halted and the crisis is deepening, andits repercussions are spreading to every corner of the world economy,
t68-7&apos;PIi;.iL chapter IITHE EUROPEAN RECOVERY PROGRAMME23,   In this critical situation, the participating countries have examined their prospective requirements and resources overthe next four years, and have in common formulated a recoveryfollow relatively unrestricted private enterprise. The meansof carrying out this programme will therefore vary from countryto country, hut each will be able fully to play its part in theprogramme, and all are determined to do so.24.   The recovery programme is based upon four points:- ,(i) A strong production effort by each of the participating countries, especially in agriculture,fuel and power, transport, and the modernisation of equipment.(ii) The creation of internal financial stability as anessential condition for securing the full&apos; use ofEurope&apos;s productive and financial resources.(iii) The development of economic co-operation betweenthe participating countries.(iv) A solution of the problem of the participating countries deficit with the american continent, particularly by exports.25,   The production expansion which is envisaged by 1951 issimilar in general scale to that achieved by the United states in the mobilisation years 1940 to 1944 ,     It calls for an unprecedented peace-time effort of work by the whole populationof all the participating countries.      It is the maximum self-help which each country can accomplish;    it will restore agricultural production very nearly to the pre-war level, and it will carry with it a significant expansion of mining and manufacturingproduction beyond the levels which were ruling in 1938*26.     The production programme provides for mutual help betweenthe participating countries over a wide field, and for anumber of practical steps for specific action, such as theInternational Power Project.     In addition broader proposals aremade for the reduction of trade barriers and the removal offinancial obstacles to intra-European trade.27.   The creation of internal financial stability in certain countries is necessary in order to get their entire productiveand distributive systems into effective operation, and in orderto secure the full use of internal and external financial resources. While the necessary economic and financial reforms can be initiatedwithout external assistance, such assistance will be required to make them fully in U.S.A. , from 1940 to 194k, coal output increased! by 3k%,steel output by 31%, electric power output by 61%.     TheEuropean coal output is planned to increase by 33% from1947 to 1951, steel output (excluding Germany; by 60%,effective.and power output by 39%.by
28.    In order to carry out their production effort, and after making full allowance for the supplies which they can obtain from each other, the participating countries need food, rawmaterials, fuel and capital equipment from overseas.     There aretwo difficulties to be overcome:    the inadequate supplies ofcertain key commodities available in the world, and the lack of means of paying for them.     In this report, it is estimated thatthat available supplies to the participating countries, assumingcomplete achievement of their agricultural programmes, will be insufficient to permit even the restoration of the pre-warstandard of food consumption by the end of 1951.     Moreover,in the immediate future, the lack of supplies from normalsources in Eastern Europe and South-East Asia increases the urgency of the need for supplies from the American Continent.The financial counterpart of the unbalanced flow of goods and services from the American Continent is the dollar deficit of the participating countries.29.     The European recovery programme cannot get fully under way untilthe immediate dollar problem is solved.Failure to solve it would destroy the basis of production and internal confidence in Europe;   .a descending spiral of production and consumption would become inevitable.      Immediate and fully adequate aid in 1948 istherefore necessary as a first step for the fulfilment of theprogramme of production, stabilization and co-operation.If the initial stages of the programme can be successfullyaccomplished, a momentum will be created that will ease the taskin the following years, ^_________30.   The productive effort which is generated in 1948 can be sustained and developed further only if the participating countries can obtain and pay for the necessary supplies from overseas.     There will still be a.large deficit in the following years.     The purpose of the European recovery programme isto reduce this deficit as fast as possible.     There will be some deficit in 1951;    the participating countries have alwaysdepended on dollar earnings from the rest of the world to meet their deficit with the American Continent, and will do so in thefuture.     But by the end of 1951, given reasonably favourableexternal conditions, the deficit should be of dimensions whichWill be manageable through normal means without special aid.31.   This is a fundamental problem which cannot be solved quickly.The effects of the war, which are so clearly illustrated by the lack of balance in the world&apos;s trading pattern, cannot be curedin a few months.     But the participating countries are confident that in four years considerable and decisive progress can bemade to overcome them.     This recovery programme can break the back of the problem.     But continuing constructive action bythe European countries and by the rest of the world will be needed fog many years to. oomsi in order to keep the tradingposition balanced and to prevent the re-appearance of theinternational maladjustment which is the root of Europe&apos;present difficulties.
933-/32*    In order to ensure that the recovery programme is carriedout, the sixteen participating countries pledge themselves toJoin together, and invite other European countries to join withthem, in working to this end.    This pledge is undertaken by each country with respect to its own national programme, hut it also takes into account similar pledges made by the other participating countries.    In particular, each country undertakes to use all Its efforts:-(i) to develop its production to reach the targets,especially for food and coal(ii) to make the fullest and most effective use of its existing productive capacity and all availablemanpower ,    . .     ______-.(iii) to modernise its equipment and transport, so that labour becomesmore productive, conditions of work are improved, and standards of living of all peoples of Europe are raised;(iv) to apply all necessary measures leading to the rapid achievement of internal financial, monetary and economic stability while maintaining in each country a high level of employment;(v) to co-operate with one another and with like-minded countriesin all possible steps to reduce the tariffs and other barriersto the expansion of trade both between themselves and with therest of the world, in accordance with the principles of the DraftCharter for an International Trade Organisation;(vi) to remove progressively the obstacles to the free movement of individuals within Europe;(vii) to organise together the means by which common resources can be developed in partnership.By these means European victory can be achieved.
10 -Final Draft chapter iii the PRODUCTION EPFfort3&quot;3,     The Committee of Co-operation concentrated, its examinationupon food and agriculture, fuel and power, steel, timber andtransport, together with related industries such as agricultural and mining machinery, as well as the general problem of labour.These are the basis of economic life and. if there is not enough of any of them the entire economy suffers.    The first task is toput these foundations right.    Success in this is the first and essential condition for the growth of the varied flow of finished products of all kinds which Europe needs for its own people andfor export.34.     These key commodities and services are all inter-dependent.More food for miners means more coal; more coal means more steel;this In turn makes it possible to produce more mining machinery andmore agricultural machinery to produce more coal and more food, andmore transport equipment to enable the increased supplies of coal toflow smoothly from the pits.      If timber is lacking, coal production is hampered and movements by rail are slowed down if there are not enough timber-ties to maintain the track.    Europe&apos;s experience show show these shortages interact upon one another and ultimately lead to industrial stagnation.   An expansion of each can likewise have acumulative stimulating effect upon the whole.structure.3-5,     The production effort of the participating countries and western Germany will therefore be concentrated on these things.   those goods and services must be provided for a population which in 1951.will exceed pre-war by 11 per cent.    The national programmes andforecasts are designed to achieve the following results by 1951:-(i) Restoration of pre-war cereal and milk production, with large increases above pre-v/ar in sugar and potatoes,  some increases in oils and fats, and as fast an expansion In livestock products as supplies of feeding stuffs v/ill allow,(ii)   Increase of coal output by 145 million tons above the 1947 (anincrease of one-third) to a figure of 30 million tons above the1938 level.(iii) Expansion of electricity output by nearly 70 billion KwH or 40$above 1947 and a growth of generating capacity by 25 million Kwor two-thirds above pre-war.(iv)   Development of oil refining capacity in terms of crude oilthroughout by 17 million tons to a level two and a half timesabove pre-war.(v)   Increase of crude steel production by 80% above 1947 to a levelof 55 million tons or 10 million tons (20J6) above 1938.(vi)   Expansion of inland transport facilities to carry a 2556 greaterload in 1951 than in 1938.(vii)Kestoration of pre-war merchant fleets of the participating countries by 1951.Supply from European production of most of the capital equipmentneeded for these expansions.
36.     The governments of the sixteen participating countries have undertaken to use all their efforts to develop their national production in order to achieve the targets specifiedabove.     Each of these Governments in assuming this undertakinghas taken into account the similar undertakings given by the other participating countries.     The sixteen participating countriesconsider that the linking together of their production efforts inthis way should be an important contribution to the achievement ofthe programmes which they have set themselves.37.     This programme is not, of course, possible by theefforts of the participating countries alonei it must be sas-tained by a flow of goods and services from the rest of theworld.   But this is the scale of the agricultural and indus-trial effort which the participating countries have decided*to make andvhich must be achieved in order to lift the levelof Luropean production to what is required to supply theEuropean peoples&apos; needs and to produce the exports which will pay for the necessary imports.38.     Pood is the first essential, and agriculture is themost important single form of economic activity in the parti-cipating countries and in Western Germany.    In terms of totalhuman effort, more must be accomplished in this field thanin any other.   The population in this area in 1951 will heabout 11 per cent above pro-war and the restoration of pre-war agricultural output can therefore be no more than thefirst stage in a Ion er-term programme.

Outstanding examples are the cereals production programmes ofFrance and Italy.    Th-se two countries are the largest pro-ducers of broad grains among the participating countries; andthe former was before the war normally self-sufficient.  &apos; InFrance bread grains production which before the war was.9&apos; million tons had fallen to an estimated 3*8 million tonsin 19U/7/48.     By 1950/51 it is estimated again to reach8.8- million tons.    The corresponding figures for Italy are,pre-war 7.4 million tons; 1947/48, 4=7 million tons; andI950/5I, 7-1 million tons.     The production of livestock productsamong all the participating countries shows an even greater declinethan that of crops;   the production of meat is only two-thirds of pre-war;   the rate at which it will increase will depend entirely uponthe availability of imported feedingstuffs.39.     As their programmes develop, some countries&apos; exportablesurpluses will increase rapidly, and this will allow otherother participating countries either to increase their con-sumption or to reduce their imports from elsewhere.    The ex-portable surplus of butter from participating countries will increase from 87,00(3 tons in 1946/47 to 154,000 tons in1950/51; that of eggs from 52,000 tons to 223,000 tons; thatof meat from 398,000 tons to 630,000 tons, and that of fruitfrom 550,000 tons to 1,911,000 tons.    This is a natural formof mutual help which will grow automatically as the produc-tion programmes proceed, ,40.     The programme requires first of all the restoration ofsoil fertility^,    The participating countries are developingtheir production of fertilisers with special emphasis uponnitrogen.       This need for nitrogen iertiliser is much -greater than pre-war, because . stable manure has been lessrich in plant nutrient for lack of imported feudingstuffs.Production of fertilisers is already well above pre-war and thepresent level will be doubled by 1950-51.     With adequate supplies of phosphates and potash, this fertiliser production will be enough to cover requirements at the end of the period,but abnormal imports of nitrogen from the American Continentwill be needed on a diminishing scale in the earlier years.The second requirement is that the mechanical means of work-ing the soil and handling the crops should be improved bythe increased use of tractors and machinery, and thus a higherproduction per working unit reached.    The production ofagricultural machinery - and especially tractors - is being actively expanded in the participating countries, and thiswill meet a steadily increasing part of the demands exceptfor special types of equipment.      The third requirement is sufficient imported feedingstuffs.    The density of popula-tion in the participating countries and Western Germany is too great to permit simultaneous production both of enoughcrops for direct consumption and of enough feedingstuffs toproduce enough protective livestock products.      Large quan-tities of protein feedingstuffs, such as oilcake, are needed to supplement home-grown winter fodder for dairy cattle,as well as feeding grain mainly for pigs and poultry.Special long-term programmes for the mechanised productionof ground nuts are being undertaken by the British and french governments in Africa,    This will eventually add signifi-cantly to the world supplies of oils and fats.41.     Fuel and power are likewise crucial. At the presenttime the United States is consuming four time as much fuel and power per head of its population as the participating countries and Western Germany, and even before the war the/ratio
/ TABLE 2.ratio was 2.\ : 1.    This affords a rough measure of thedifference between the technical levels of the United Statesand the European economies and underlines frurope&apos;s mainneed, not only to recover its pre-war supplies of energy butalso to increase them progressively and thus raise the wholestandard of productivity of European workersi42-.     Before the war four-fifths of the power &quot;used in the participating countries and Western Germany was deriveddirectly or indirectly, from coal.    They expect over the next four years a substantial increase in the use of petroleum-products and the development of new hydro-electric capacity,but the basic source of power will continue to be coal.43.     Coal production is still 20 per cent below the pre-war level, because of the fall in output in the Bi-Zone ofGermany and the United Kingdom. The basic difficulties areshortages of trained labour, low labour productivity,obsolescence of mining installations and, in the Ruhr,enormous war damage.    In the United Kingdom the expansionof 50 million tons a year planned between 1947 and 1951is based on an increase in trained man-power, intensiveuse of modern mechanised methods and capital developmentsincluding 20 hew sinkings; the requirements of miningmachinery and supplies of all kinds in the four-year period will exceed 01 billion, almost all of which will he pro-duced in the United Kingdom.    It is hoped to resume exportsto other participating countries after April 1948, thequantity rising from 6 million tons in 1948 to 29 million tons in 1951.44.     In the Bi-Zone of Western Germany there will be anincrease of 60 million tons in 1951 compared with 194-7,but the extent of devastation has been so great that the1938 output will not be regained in this period.    In the saar, production will reach the 1938 level in 1948, andwill in 1951 be 20 per cent above it.    In Prance, too,where production already is over pre-war level, a further expansion of 12 million tons or &apos;25 per cent is plannedby 1951.    The net result is that for the participating countries and Western Germany as a whole production in1951 wil^i be 30 million tons higher than in 1938.

To carry out this programme requires more intensiveexploitation of coal by modern mechanised methods, the provisionof an adequate and efficient labour force, and improvement in food and housing.     The European Coal Organisation is making aspecial examination of the best means of securing the most efficient use of such surplus capacity as may exist for manufacturing mining supplies.     The Committee examined thepitprop position, particularly in order to break the viciouscircle by which exports of pitprops are checked for lack of coalwhile coal production is checked for lack of pitprops.     Plans for increasing the supplies of coal to Scandinavia have enabled theCommittee to allow for more imports of pitprops from Sweden.It is expected that Sweden will be able to increase her exports ofpitprops to 300,000 solid cubic metres a year, which is 50 per cent above her pre-war exports, and this and other proposals should bringsupply and demand into balance.Consumption of electricity has increased during the war,but there has been no corresponding increase in generating capacity.   A further substantial growth of consumption isexpected to a level in 1951 about 80 per cent about that of 1938.    Inorder to catch up the arrears and to provide for this further expansion, the annual rate of growth of generating capacity will;have to be nearly four times the rate in 1937/38.    This presentsa major industrial task.    In view of the coal position, emphasisJis being laid on thermal plants designed to consume low grade fuelsand more particularly on hydro-electric plants.   But it is;Certain that for many years generating capacity will not beienough to meet requirements,^7.        In addition to the expansion programmes which are already under way, the Committee considered further means of exploitingjhydro-electric and lignite resources, and a special working party was set up to study this problem.   It examined many projects and chose a plan which comprises six hydro-electric plants in italy, Prance and on the Austro-Italo-Swiss frontier togetherwith two lignite thermal plants in Germany and one geothermalPlant in Italy.    These projects have been selected without     fjj&apos;&apos;&quot;^,regard to national frontiers and involve^the co-operativedevelopment of resources cutting across frontiers, 48/j
&apos; &quot;1 5-    .48.     A further consequence of the coal shortage Is the increasing use of fuel oil, consumption of which is expected torise from 12 million tons in 1947 to 28 million tons in 1951,This, together with the increasing demands for petroleum productsresulting from the mechanisation of agriculture, the expansion ofindustry and the growth of road transport, presents a formidableproblem to all participating countries, for this whole area hasvirtually no natural resources of oil.      It is planned to reducethe foreign exchange &quot;burden as far as possible by the developmentof oil refining capacity;    this will also provide raw materials for the increasingly important chemical processes dependent uponoil derivatives. .   This involves expanding the production ofrefined products by the participating countries and western germany by 1951 &quot;to 2-g- times the pre-war level.49.     One of the most difficult problems considered by theCommittee is the supply of hard coke and coking coalsFor the last ^ixty years the iron and steel industries of western Continental Europe have been based on the- combination ofRuhr coking coal (which is eminently suitable for makinghard coke essential for steel manufacture) and Lorraine iron ore.     With the reduced level of coal output prevailing in the ruhr, with its consequential effect on the level of hard cokeand coking coal exports, and the fact that the United Kingdom isnot yet able to resume exports of coking coal on the pre-warscale, the supplies available are not enough to meet thedemands of the iron and steel industries in Prance, Belgium,Luxemburg and other countries,50.     The Committee has developed a plan to cover the cokedeficit, which was originally estimated at 20 per cent of requirements-in 1948.     This would involve the diversion of coke from non-metallurgical uses, coke economy by the use ofricher iron ores in blast furnaces, and the import of a larger proportion of-coking coal in place of other coal from the UaiteftStates and Poland.   - In addition, in the Bi-Zone of Germany, onIncreased rate of carbonisation would be called for and ahigher proportion of hard coke in western German solid fuelexports.      These measures will demand a high degree of co-operation and effort, particularly in the Bi-Zone of Germany^and wijj. have to be continued in order to ensure that the  . -supplies of coke vital to European steel production areavailable in sufficient quantities.51*     If the coke plan is successful, the full programme foriron and steel production can probably   be achieved despitecontinuing difficulty in the provision of scrap and possihlysome shortage of rich iron ore in the later years of theperiod.     Supplies of manganese ore may also be scarce.     A .slight shortfall in the programme would not affect the basic,engineering industries which provide the equipment for producingthe key -commodities mentioned in this chapter but it wouldprobably affect tho rate at which the construction industriescould cope   ith tho physical reconstruction of the war-tornareas.52.      The full steel programmes for the participating countries,together with target figures for &quot;Yestern Germany, are shownin the following tablei-/ TABLE 5

The total of those figures gives ameasure of the output of which the plant of the countriestaken together was capable.(b) The figures for the Bi-Zone of Western Germany are put forward by the Control Authorities as targets which could be achievedprovided that certain assumptions are fulfilled.    Under the march 1946 Level of Industry plan steel production would belimited, to 4.7 million ingot tons.      Production,  however,might be raised to 10 million tons in 1951?  in conformitywith the level permitted in the Bi-Zonal Level of IndustryPlan announced by the Commanders-in-Chief on 29th August, 1947.It could certainly;, with proper efforts on the part of theindustry, be raised to 7 or 8 million tons by that date.Any calculations based on the 10 million ingot ton figuremust take account of the statement that the measures about to be taken&quot;by the Commanders-in-Chief do not prejudgequadripartite decisions of the Council of Foreign ministers in respect of the level of industry for Germany as a whole and such industrial limitations as may be i posed by thepeace settlement.j[3.    In spite of the fuel shortage,  the participating countriesRre now producing more steel than they did in 1938, although thisis still less than their production in pre-war peak years when he French, Belgian and Luxemburg industries we;-e working at nearlyfull capacity.      The programme for crude steel in 1951 for the participating countries is nearly 60)o above 1947,  and will be 25%above the total of their best pre-war years.      The increase infinished steel is slightly greater than that in crude.I.J4.   This growth in the production of the participating countriesffill compensate for the reduction in Western Germany&apos;s steel out-put^below the inflat d level reached during the years of rearmament -ment;    total production in 1951 will not significantly exceed thepre-war capacity of the area taken as a whole.      Even with this expansion of output,  indeed,  the consumption of steel per head ine participating countries and Western&quot;Germany will be onlyird that of the United States./55.one-The
55.     The full programme is one of making maximum use of existingcapacity, of modernisation,; and to some extent of expansion.In the four year period, new capacity will &quot;be coming intooperation in the participating countries at all stages ofmanufacture..    It will add more to existing capacity for pig ironand crude steel than for finished steel where a relatively high .proportion of the new construction will replace old plant.In most of the participating countries modernisation and re-equipment will at all stages of the industry be more important than new construction; only about 20 per cent of the output in1951 will be from new capacity.    The modernisation programmesaim at increasing the efficiency of the industry as a whole,particularly in the. use of fuel and manpower.56. The building of new iron and steel-making capacity is a major operation.    The countries represented at Paris have recognised the value of assembling data about future trends ofsteel supplies and requirements and the Committee has arranged for the interchange of information by the steel-prodxicingcountries about their programmes of modernisation and extensionso that each coun.tx&apos;y,  in developing its programme, may take account of the plans made by the others.57. Expansion of steel production will clear the way for aconsiderable increase in engineering output, particularly in those branches of the engineering industry which provide equipment forthe key commodities and services,.    The bulk of the equipment required for these purposes will in fact be provided by the participating countries and Western Germany themselves.    Theywill themselves produce well over 90 per cent,  of their total requirements of mining equipment which are estimated at 031700millions; for the programme of generating plant extensions -$5,300 millions - the proportion is much the same; they will produce two-thirds of their petroleum equipment requirements, both for the domestic refining programmes and for development overseas;apart from certain special items,  such as continuous wide stripmills,  they will provide most of. the plant required for theexpansion and modernisation of their iron and steel industries;the European tractor and agricultural&quot;machinery industries areexpanding fast and will suffice to cover the long-term require-ments except again for special types of equipment,58. The reconstruction of inland transport will make heavy demands on the iron and steel and engineering industries, for arrears of inadequate war-time maintenance must be made up as well as theexpansion required in order to enable the railways to carrysubstantially increased loads in 1951.    The increase in loco-motive production should, be sufficient to meet essential needs andto provide a margin for export overseas; production of freightcars,  on the other hand, will be insufficient to make good theheavy war-time destruction..    Requirements for passenger coachesare being kept down to the minimum and 90 per cent,  of them willbe covered by home production,,    The production of the necessaryrolling stock is a formidable task and the Committee has paidspecial attention to means of securing economy, both in their production and. in their use.,    A proposal for an internationalfreight car pool is being submitted for discussion by the EconomicCommittee for Europe and. the problem of standardisation of freightcar design is being referred to the International StandardsConference.59. The participating countries intend,  during the next fouryears,  to make good their war-time losses of 22 -million gross registered tons of shipning tonnage.    Part of this gap willbe/
-To-be filled by purchases, but a far larger tonnage will be built in the participating countries&apos; own shipyards.    At the end of1951  the merchant fleets at the disposal of the participating countries will be somewhat larger than in 1938, but against this must be set the disappearance of the German merchant fleet.This shipbuilding effort is a work of reconstruction whichmust be carried through if the participating countries are to boable to stand on their own feet.60. The basis of all this constructional work is steel.  Ofother constructional materials,   timber is one of which the participating countries and ) estern Germany are normally largeimporters.     The supply of timber is crucial for mining, inland transport,shipbuilding and house construction which was interrupted during six yearsof war - as well as for rebuilding the shattered cities.     In spite of the over-cutting of forests which has taken place during the war and thus the urgent need to return to sound timber economy, most of the participating countries have accepted the resolution of the Marianske Lazne Conference toincrease production by 10 per cent, in 1948 and 1949.    At the same timethe occupation authorities in Western Germany have adopted a policy of raising the rate of cutting in the forests which were carefully husbandedduring the war.     It is important that a continued effort should be demanded of timber production in Germany.     It is entirely clear, however,that total supplies will be inadequate and will prevent the developmentof housing programmes which are urgently needed;   in many countries thehousing shortage is a cause of low productivity, and everywhere it isa check to the mobility of labour.61. With one exception all the participating countries are experiencing labour shortage,.    This will continue during theperiod of expansion provided that the necessary supplies can bemade available from overseas in order to enable the recovery programme to be carried out.    The exception is Italy whose normalincrease in population is too great to be absorbed by anypracticable expansion of agricultural and industrial production.It is possible that at a later date Western Germany might alsobe a source of labour recruitment.    The present surplus Italianlabour force of 2 millions would,  if suitably trained, be enoughto cover the needs of all the other countries,.    Considerableefforts have been made to transfer labour from Italy and some success has been, achieved, in this as well as in the absorption of displaced persons now in Germany and Austria,    Pood andparticularly housing shortages, however, present difficulties and ithas not always beon possible to devise adequate means of enablingItalians in foreign countries to send remittances back to their families at home.    The Committee has recommended means of aidingthe recruitment of immigrant labour, but the solution of theproblem really turns upon better food and housing and improvementin intra-Buropean payments arrangements,.    This problem,like the rest of the problems which confront the- partic patingcountries, can be solved only by the carrying through of theEuropean recovery programme as a whole.62. The participating countries are confident that this hugejproduction programme can be achieved.    If a good start is made,the programme will move with its own momentum;  these modernizationand development projects will all increase productivity and thus[contribute to raising the general! level of industrial productionjand exports.    But the programmes as a whole are inter-dependent.jEvery element in them depends upon the others -- mining machineryjupon steel and steel upon coa]^- and in turn depends upon thejavailability of supplies from overseas in the right Quantities and0+ the rinrht times, upon the maintun^nco of internal financialI+kS 1   H ?nd upCii continuing and effective mutual help betweenthe participating countries. .r,./ 01I.wj   .1 iliJX    j, v 0
19 &apos; EIMkJZME!LlIICHAPTER IVINTERNAL FINANCIAL AND MONETARY STABILITY63. To create internal and financial monetary stability is indispensable for the success of the production programme.The targets set up in the previous chapter cannot be fullyachieved unless the economies of all European countries arein a stable condition.     Instability in any country affects the participating countries as a whole, for it hampers enddistorts trade and prevents the affected countries from making their full contribution to the recovery programme.64. All the participating countries are to a greater or lessextent affected by inflation resulting from the war.     this general inflationary pressure is generated by the reciprocaleffects of a shortage of supplies of consumer goods on the onehand and the increase in money incomes on the other.     Theexistence of a large volume of surplus purchasing power is initself a great stimulus to this inflationary pressure and thegrowth of money incomes develops with cumulative force when itis fed by inflationary financing of budget deficits.65. The strength of the inflationary pressure differs widelyfrom country to country, partly according to the success of theefforts which the country makes to resist it and partlyaccording to the circumstances of the country itself.     In some countries relative stability of prices and wages has beenpreserved by drastic domestic policies of reducing purchasingpower, controls, and rationing;   where there is serious shortage of food and consumer goods, however, workers cannotspend their earnings to satisfy their normal needs, and the incentive to work is less than in normal conditions.   . Inother countries a much more advanced stage of inflation hasbeen reached;   po^t-war budgets have not been balanced andthere has been a continual rise in prices which inevitablyloads to demands for higher wagos - a situation which is verydifficult to cure and which threatens to lead to a distrustof the national currency.     This has led in turn to thehoarding of food or to its disposal in the black market;agricultural producers prefer to reduce their sales or not tosell at all because they cannot buy things with tho moneythey obtain.     Industrial workers spend much of their timelooking for food and goods.     People refuse to invest capital in fixed interest securities and seek to transfer it intogold or foreign exchange;    capital held abroad is left there and becomes a hidden private asset which brings no benefit tothe nation as a -whole.66.    This situation of acute inflation endangers the wholerecovery programme.,    The governments of the interested par-participating countries.therefore undertake to carry out fndepen-dently of any external aid the internal measures within their power in fiscal and currency matters as also in the field! ofproduction in order to restrict forthwith calls on the Bank of issue as well as other inflationary measures and to increasethe production of consumer and capital goods.67.    The first year of the recovery programme is of crucial importance, and effective action must start then.      But to achieve stabilization is no quick or easy process.      To -/overcome
overcome inflation requires great determination by thegovernment and a readiness to accept sacrifices by the people.The first step must be to stop the creation of purchasingpower by budget deficits and the like, and this must befollowed up by bringing the amount of available spending power into a proper balance with the supply of consumer goods.This is the difficult point, for whilst the achievement of a successful stabilization will permit the increase of produc-tion and will release hoarded goods,, there will inevitably bean interval before the measures become effective.68.    In order to bridge this interval, external aid is ofdecisive importance.      It can enable the necessary amount ofimports to be obtained, and thus provides the basis for thestabilization operation before the operation has time to yield results in increased production.     Yifhen inflation has reached a critical stage, indeed, financial reform andstabilization cannot be accomplished quickly enough and com-pletely enough by internal measures alone.      All countrieswhich are suffering from inflationary pressure need anadequate volume of imports.69.    A successful stabilization will however positively help the country1s external financial position.      It will of coursehelp directly by stimulating production and exports, but it willalso help indirectly by bringing foreign exchange assets back into normal circulation, and by restoring confidence open upnew possibilities of attracting foreign investment and credits.70.    External aid should in any case be used as a steppingstone towards internal financial recovery.      It must be usedin such a way that by the end of the period of aid, national income in its widest sense will cover national expenditure.The main aim should clearly be to reduce inflationary pressure, where it exists.     For example, the local currencyreceived by any government as a result of such aid whichdirectly or indirectly takes the form of imported goods,should be used in order to stop the recourse to Banks of issue to cover budget deficits, to repay advances already received from Banks of Issue or to reduce the resort toother inflationary budgetary practices.      If external aidmakes it possible to incur new public expenditure, such expenditure should preferably be directed to productivepurposes.      The opportunity&apos;must be taken to use the aidas fully as possible in order to secure internal financial stability.71.    If the gold and dollar reserves of the country concerned have been exhausted there may be real difficulty in main-taining or restoring confidence in the currency, even if thebudget has been&apos; balanced and the continual increase of pur-chasing power stopped&apos;and even if sufficient special externalaid is forthcoming to permit the purchase of imports.      Toassist the difficult and painful operation of bringinginflation under control and then stopping it, supplementaryaid specifically designed to raise the country&apos;s gold and dollar reserves to an adequate amount would be of the greatesthelp.      The amount of such aid that is required is the totalof the amounts which the various countries concerned need tomake up their gold and dollar reserves to a minimum level which will restore confidence.      No precise calculation canbe made of the amount required without examining the positionof each of the countries concerned at the time when the&apos;stabilisation is undertaken0    But from such estimates as canbe made the amount likely to be required would be of theorder of 02% billions,e4,
72.     Apart from its immediate purpose of stopping the inflation-tion and restoring international confidence in the currency,this strengthening of the gold and dollar reserves would be   -of the greatest help to these countries when they had maintained or regained a position of stable equilibrium andwere in a position to make their currencies convertible inaccordance with the articles of Agreement of the international monetary Fund if they possessed adequate gold and dollar reserves.73.     No country would expect such supplementary aid to begiven unless it could demonstrate satisfactorily that the aid would be used to carry out a programme of stabilisationand would not be exhausted by financing imports.7k.     Recognising this, the countries represented on theCommittee of Co-operation have pledged themselves to theirown people and to the peoples of Europe that where stabilisation-tion programmes are required, they will be carried out in a spirit of -determination.   Further-, these governments havepledged themselves to make their, currencies convertible inaccordance with the Articles of A-re-inforcement of the international monetary Fund after stabilisation has been fully achievedand can be successfully maintained.    The governments concernedfurther pledge themselves that ,any external aid received forthis purpose Y/ill be used for this purpose only and applied in constructive and comprehensive measures to put an end toinflation and eventually, when the necessary conditions havebeen fulfilled, to make their currencies convertible.75.      In particular,  the French Government has made.clear to the Committee its determination to meet all budget expen-ditures from current revenue in 19k8 and to confine itsinternal borrowing to the covering of expenditure related tothe reconstruction of buildings and to industrial investment.A comprehensive plan for stabilization is being elaboratedand will be published in the near future./CHAPTER V
-22-FINAL DRAFT chapter VECONOMIC CO OPERATION76. In addition to the massive self-help represented by theindividual countries&apos; production programmes and stabilization plans,a wide range of actual and potential mutual help between the partic-ipating countries has emerged from the Committee&apos;s discussions.    Thework in Paris in fitting together the various production targets intoa European programme; the undertaking by each country to the others to use its best efforts to carry out its production programme; thecreation of an organization to review the progress made with theproduction programmes - these together constitute an historic andunprecedented step forward in European economic co-operation,77.        The controlling principle of the Committee*s work has beenthe inter-dependence of the national economies of the participating countries, and if these countries are to proceed quickly along theroad to recovery, they must proceed together.    In each subject examined by the Committee, therefore, the first step has been to see how far thevarious countries can meet each other needs, and full account hasbeen taken of the possibilities of mutual help in assessing therequirements to be met from the outside world.78.___Thgro io nothing new in this-; &quot;jfhe structure of the Europeaneconomy as it existed &quot;before the war was(a highly developed systemof mutual help.    It was founded upon the specialization of human skill and industrial capacity which was in fact responsible for the relat-ively high standard of living which these countries enjoyed inrelat-ion to their limited natural resources.   The economic life of someof these countries was based entirely upon supplying others; some ofthe participating countries are more closely integrated together than others, but between all of them there are close traditional linkswhich form a natural bond, and which they have been striving to re-forge after the disruption of the war.    It is therefore entirely nat-ural that a complicated network of mutual help should exist,  and thatit should develop further as production grows.79* In every one of the products examined by the Committee,national production programmes are being developed which will satisfy the needs of other European countries and so reduce the deficiencieswhich at present must be supplied from the outside world and in part-particular from the American Continent.    The food-exporting participating countries are planning to increase their export surpluses as fast asthey can, and in meat, dairy produce and fruit these will make a largecontribution by 1951; the United Kingdom coal development programme,carried out at very large capital cost, will begin to make supplies available for other participating countries in 1948, rising to 29million tons a year in 1951; the expansion programmes for agricultural machinery and nitrogen fertiliser, -besides providing for the needs ofthe countries which are carrying them out, will also supply other participating countries&apos; needs and will permit a rapid reduction inthe supplies required from the United States; co-operative measures are being taken to increase the production of timber; most of thework of rebuilding the merchant fleets of the participating countries is being carried out in their own or each others&apos; yards.   Much of thismutual help arises in the normal course of trade, but there have beentpertain special cases,  such as that of hard coke and coking coal,i!in which particular arrangements have been worked out.
jo. The movement of goods and services within Europe is nowhampered-by restrictions&apos;on imports and exports, by the efforts whichcountries have been forced to make to balance their trade with eachither bilaterally and the restrictions on the movement of men andromen within Europe.    It is agreed that it is desirable to sweep these restrictions away as early as possible.    There are serious and practicaldangers for the participating countries if these restrictions are more stringent than is necessary and if they are retained inoperation longer than is justified, by the balance of payments difficulties of the countries which impose them.    The analysis in chapter &quot;VII shows decisively, indeed, how Europe&apos; s welfare depends upon its ability to sell a large and increasing volume of goods to the outside world and. particularly to the American Continent.It will be impossible to develop the efficient and variedproduction which will be required for this purpose if uneconomicproduction is stimulated and if artificial price structures areperpetuated.    It will, in any case, be impossible for 1heparticipating, countries to build, up their exports to thenecessary extent unless a sound, and multilateral trading systemdevelops in the world, and the principles, which have guided theframers of the Draft Charter for an International trade organisation, are carried into effect.61. The restrictions on imports and exports between the participating countries will, therefore, be relaxed progressivelyas production increases and existing balance of payments difficulties d.iminish8    The conditions which Will make it possible to restore multilateral trade and no longer to seekclose bilateral balance in payments with one another are; increased and better balanced, production, internal stability and greater flexib-*ility in payments arrangements.    As soon as these conditions exist tothe extent necessary for concrete and practical measures to be takento relax import and export restrictions,  the participating countries will initiate measures aimed at a freer multilateral development oftheir mutual trade in conformity with the principles of the draftCharter for an International Trade Organization.82. The greater flexibility of paswients arrangements is of part-particular importance, for without it there can be no real relaxation of import restrictions.    There was preliminary discussion of this problem by a Committee of Financial Experts, but it was not possibleto work out detailed proposals on this subject during the sessions of the Committee, partly because the monetary authorities ofmany of the participating countries were greatly preoccupied withthe difficulties arising from the dollar crisis and the temporary suspension of the convertibility of sterling.    A meeting is to beheld immediately after the close of the Conference in London of governors of the International Monetary Fund and. the international bank for Reconstruction and Development,  in order to develop thegeneral ideas which were discussed by the Committee of FinancialExperts into a sound and workable scheme.83. As long as balance of payments difficulties make itnecessary to maintain quantitative restrictions on trade, their general effect is to restrict trade more severely than tariffs.    The levels of these tariffs, as between different goods and. countries, vary: theyare by no means viniversally high,  and existing or prospectivelevels of tariffs in the rest of the world,  as well as withinEurope, have important influence on industrialists&apos; plans for developing their production.
-24-84. The extent to which the interchange of goods is likelyto he impeded &quot;by t ariff s is, therefore, of fundamental importance for the future development of the European economy on sound lines.The Draft Charter for an International Trade Organisation offerstwo lines of attack on the problem of tariffs.    It is the basicaim of the Draft Charter to secure the progressive world-widereduction of tariffs on a multi-lateral basis, but it also providesfor the possibility that groups of countries may wish to formCustoms Unions.85. Tariff barriers in non-participating countries are a seriousobstacle to the indispensable flow of exports from the participating countries, and the world-wide reduction of tariffs is both necessary and beneficial for the European economy.    This is necessary toprovide increased overseas outlets for its exports, and beneficialin its influence on the pattern of economic activity withinthe participating countries as a group,    A start has been made in thenegotiations at Geneva with a multi-lateral reduction of tariffs^It is essential for the participating countries that efforts should be made to secure further progressive reductions in tariffs on this multi-lateral basis,  and in these efforts the participating countries are prepared to play their full part.86.        The Committee has considered the question of.CustomsUnions, provision for the formation of which has been made in theDraft Charter of the International Trade Organisation.    The advantages which the United States has enjoyed through the existence of a largedomestic market with no internal trade barriers are manifestoUnder different circumstances and on a smaller scale thedecision of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg to form a customs Union is an instructive example of mutual co-operation in this field.87. It is clear that the negotiation of a Customs Union,particularly betv/een several large and highly industrialised,countries, would be a complicated process which could only beachieved by progressive stages over a period of years.    special problems also arise for countries with a high proportion oftheir trade outside any proposed Customs Union or between countries at widely differing stages of economic development.88,        The formation of a larger free trade area in Europe couldbe expected to lead to greater efficiency in many sectors ofproduction and this would not only increase the wealth of thecountries concerned but would also be of assistance in solving the fundamental problem of tho European balance of payments.It cannot, however, be regarded as a solution of this problem,for this is a world problem and cannot be solved without the closest possible economic association with countries outside europe from which the participating countries derive the bulkof their essential imports.    The development of trade withEastern European countries, with the American Continent and withthe rest of.the world is of critical importance for the participating countries.89. Nevertheless, the idea of a Customs Union including as manyEuropean countries as possible is one which contains importantPossibilities for the economic future of Europe, and it is in thegeneral interest that the problems involved should receivecareful and detailed study by governments.    In Benelux some ofthese problems have already been studied and resolved.    Thefour Scandinavian countries have taken steps to study immediately the possibility of securing economic co-operation between themselves, including the question of the elimination, wholly or partly,/
partly, of the Customs frontiers, between the four countries.The Governments of have established a study group to examine the problems involved and the steps to be takenin the formation of a Customs Union and have invited, other European States to join them in this undertaking90. In this connexion The French Government has made thefollowing declaration:-&quot;The French Government being of the opinion that thebarriers which now exist in the way of a freer exchangeof goods and. capital, and of a freer movement of personsbetween the various European countires, constitute oneof the most important obstacles to the economic recovery of these countries;that in the present state of the world only economicunits sufficiently large to have at their disposal animportant home market are able to lower the price ofindustrial and agricultural production sufficiently toensure, thanks to better technique, an improved standardof living for their people while still allowing thecountries concerned to withstand world-wide competition,that the present division of Europe into small-economicunits does not correspond to the needs of moderncompetition and that it will be possible with the-help of customs unions to construct larger units on the strictlyeconomic plane, -   /that these units must not be in any way &quot;autarchic&quot; in character but on the contrary should increase their tradeto the utmost with all other countries or economic groups of countries to the maximum degree,that the formation of such customs unions is foreseen inthe draft I.T.O. charter;declares that it is ready to enter into negotiations withall European Governments who share these views, who wishto enter a customs union with France and whose nationaleconomies are capable of being combined with the Frencheconomy in such a way.as to make a viable unit.&quot;tt will be necessary for the formation of such unions to bespread over a period of years long enough to allow for the necessary^justments, so that the agricultural and manufacturing; activities in the contracting countries do not have to suffer a suddenchange in the conditions in which they at present operate.The starting point for this period of establishment should befixed by mutual agreement as from the moment when the contractingcountries have succeeded, in achieving internal economic^d monetary stability. -In the course of this period,  steps will be taken progressivelyl;o achieve the customs unions contemplated by the .reduction of tariffspid the elimination of quantitative restrictions.I      The French Government considers, furthermore, that the achievementPr the foregoing would be greatly hastened and eased by such external!lelp as Europe may be in a position to obtain in order to re-establishpiuilibrium in its economy and finances.I -      -   --   - - &apos; -The Italian Government having, from the outset of the Conference, raised forpcussion the problem of Customs Unions, wishes to associate itself with the aboveIclsration by the French Government which, in its.view, is in general conformity with&amp;e proposals submitted by the Italian Delegation to the Committee.
91. The Governments ofhave indicated that they have associated themselves with this declaration.&apos;92. As important to recovery as the free movement of goods isthe free movement of the labour supply. The Committee has there fore made a series of recommendations which win makeeasier the migration of labour from countries which have a surplus of manpower to those in which there is an unsatisfieddemand for labour.     It is important that these recommendations should beacted upon without delay as, when the production programmes get under way,there is enough work ahead in most countries to provide full employment formany years to come, provided that the flow of raw materials from the outside world can be maintained.93. Tourism is one of the invisible exports upon&apos;which the participating countries will increasingly rely as a means ofbalancing their accounts with the rest of the world.    In this,as in goods, the relaxation of restrictions upon the intra-jiteBPopoan flow would be of assistance towards the main objective.94. In developing projects for general European Cooperationthe Committee has concentrated as far as possible on removing the obstructions to the free flow of normal productive general   -gies and trade.    There are, however, fields where common col-loctive action is desirable to secure the .most efficient develop-ment of European resources.    Such action can be illustratedeffectively by four series of decisions which have been madeby the Committee.95. Firstly, a series of projects is being developed for commonplanning of the exploitation of new sources of electrical power.The plan which has been selected, by the Committee provides forthe erection of a series of power plants to exploit the hydro-electric resources of the Alps, certain German lignite deposits and Italian reserves of geothermic energy.    This work, involves the co-operative development of-resources cutting across frontiersand the decisions arc being taken without regard to nationalfrontiers.    Preparation of periodic revisions of a survey ofEuropean large scale power resources and the study of thedesirability of establishing a international high tension networkrepresent similar fields for continuing common planning.96. Secondly, the participating countries are seeking toincrease the efficiency of production by encouraging thestandardisation of certain types of equipment.    These includemining and electrical supplies and freight cars on which it isproposed that the International Technical Standards conference should be asked, to report.97.^        Thirdly,&apos; there is the possibilitjr of securing a more efficient use of freight cars by pooling arrangements andfurther transport economy might be secured by internationalstudy of the flows of traffic.98. Fourthly, in view of the Ugh cost of installation of steelproducing capacity, arrangements are being made for the inter-change of information by the steel producing countries about their programmes of modernisation and extension So that each country, in developing its programme, may take account of the plans/
plans made &quot;by the others.99, The means of mutual help between the participating countries are so diverse that they cannot be listed as a seriesof measures.    Most of the mutual help consists simply of normal trade and will grow- accordi ngly as production expands;  some ofit,consists of specific action between two or more governments;some of it consists of wider governmental action in order toprovide a general freeing of trade and payments arrangements;some again consists of wider governmental action to solve  &apos;particular problems or to allocate particular supplies.    Inmost of these cases other governments arc involved, besidesthose of the participating countries,100. Wherever suitable international &quot;machinery exists, it isthe desire of the participating countries that those ta3ksshould be effectively followed up within the framework of theUnited Nations,    ^any of the reports of the Technical Committeesaccordingly state that suggestions for continued study of someof the production problems will be made by interested governmentsat the forthcoming meetings of the Committees and Sub-committees of the Economic Commission for Europe,    In this way problems which are also of concern to countries not represented on theCommittee of Co-operation could, usefully be examined on a wid*Wbasis and for the benefit of Europe as a whole.    It should benoted that five out of the sixteen participating countries, not as yet being members of the United Nations, are not members.ofthe Economic Commission for Europe.    They are, however, beinginvited to attend the forthcoming meetings of those&apos; committees of the Commission in whose subjects they are interested.    Itis hoped, that the work for which this report indicates the needmay be carried, out effectively in the some spirit ofco-operation and in a wider forum,101, These measures will continue, in practical and aonereteform, the co-operation achieved in preparing this report for presentation to the Government of the United. States.    Theexperience of the Committee of Co-operation in Paris hasstrikingly proved the&apos;value of joint discussion of commonproblems.    The Governments of the participating countriesregret that other European countries have not been able toassociates themselves with this work, but still hope to bringabout a more complete collaboration among all the countries ofEurope,102.        The&apos; Committee of Co-operation was set up as a specialtemporary organisation whose functions should consist of preparing a programme of European recovery having in view a   periodof four years.    This initial work has now been completed.   Thepresent session of the Committee is therefore over.    But thereis a second stage, which is the examination of the Report inthe United States.    The Chairman, the Rapporteur General,certain delegates from participating countries and a number of technical experts will therefore hold themselves in readiness toprovide the United States Government with information concerningthe Report.     The Committee may be reconvened, should this be necessary,at the request of the Chairman.103, The participating Governments declare that they are ready to set up a joint organisation charged with the task ofreviewing progress achieved in the execution of this programme ifthe necessary means for carrying out the programme are madeavailable.    This organisation will ensure, to the full extent possible by joint action, the realisation of the economicconditions necessary to enable the general objectives to which each country has pledged itself to be effectively achieved.    Theorganisation/
Wganisation, which it is contemplated will eventually beestablished, will make periodical reports to the variousparticipating European Governments on the extent to which theprogramme is being realised.    The Governments will supply theorganisation with all information required for this purpose *The organisation will bo of a temporary character and will cease to exist when the special aid necessary for the recovery ofEurope comes to an ends10k,        The participating countries fully realise the importance which attaches to the achievement of the programme throughboth national and collective action for the future of tho Europeaneconomy and for the well-being of the world as: a whole and theyare determined at the appropriate time to make whatever specificarrangements may be necessary to co-ordinate its execution.
FINAL DRAFT chapter vi the IMPORT REQUIREMENTS105* In order to carry out their production effort, and after making full allowance for mutual help, the participating countries and Western Germany need a continuous flow of goods and services from the rest of the world, and in particular fromthe American Continent.     This flow may be interrupted becauseof shortage of supplies or because of inability to pay for them.Such interruption would set the whole programme back, and would create further dislocation.      This dependence upon a continuousflow of imports is the normal state of European countries;    ithas been intensified by the war and its aftermath, but theposition is not now fundamentally different from what it hasbeen for the last fifty years.106. An import programme has been developed for these countries for the years 19U8 to 1951.     It is based primarily upon thework of the Technical Committees, which have estimated theamount of supplies which will be available for participating countries and Western Germany, and have valued them at theprices ruling on 1st July 1947.     For imports not covered bythe Technical Committees, the various countries submittedestimates of their requirements.     These estimates were on thebasis that sufficient raw material imports would be provided tomake possible the full production effort, whilst standards of consumption during the period would not exceed the levels whichthe various countries would expect to be able to afford tomaintain at the end of the period without special external aid.The resulting programme is as follows:-TABLE U, Import Programme of the Participating_Countries and Western Germany_( *000 millions at prices of 1st July 1947)	From American Continent	- From other non-participating countries	Total1948	9.2	4-7	13.91949	9.2	5-4	1U.61950	8.6	5.9	14.51951	8.2	6.2	14.4107*  This total import programme will be somewhat larger in volume than the normal pre-war imports from these groups of countries.     But its distribution will be very different.Before the war some 45 per cent   of the participating countries&apos;imports from the rest of the world came from the American Contin-ent;    in 1948, the proportion will be two-thirds.     There hasbeen a serious loss of supplies from non-American sources, andthe effect-of this is a very large increase in the requirements from the American Continent.      This indeed is a main reason whythe latter are high;    the loss of non-American sources ofsupplies is of decisive importance.      This loss cannot be measured precisely, but it may be roughly estimated that morethan one-quarter of the import requirements from the American/Continent
Continent at the beginning of the four-year period areattributable to this cause.108. This arises mainly from the war devastation in eastern europe and the Soviet Union.     The participating countriescannot rely upon supplies from the. Danubian granary, and verylittle is now coming westward from there.   . The Western zones of Germany are unable to draw from their natural source ofsupply - Eastern Germany - and the result is that western germany now. emerges as a large food importer;   npt only is thepopulation of Western Germany one-sixth above pre-war, but itmust also seek entirely new sources of food supply.     eastern european sources of timber supply have now ceased, and the     ^Soviet union reconstruction needs will make heavy callsupon them for many years to come;   before the war, the soviet union m&amp;       Baltic states supplied 25 %m&amp; cant, of the sawnsoftwood. needf!      the participating countries and western germany, 40 fcer cent, of the plywood and 3P per cent, of thepitprops.109* It is reasonable to expect that the westward flow offood and agricultural and forestry ^products will gradually be resumed.     Certainly the participating countries intend to do what thoy can to encourage its resumption.     But even onfavourable assumptions about the availability of supplies inthe east, progress is bound&apos; to be slow, and the abnormaldependence upon the American Continent will remain.     A sub-stantial and steady resumption of Eastern European food,feeding-stuffs, and timber supplies is assumed in thisreport;   the pre-war flow of cereals from Eastern Europe is assumed to be restored by. 1951? and the supplies of timberare assumed to reach 75 Pfer cent, of pre-war by 1951&quot;.     but even so, the proportion of food and feeding-stuffs importsfrom the American Continent is still 55 per cent, in 1951?compared with (      ) per cent, in 1938, and the proportion .of timber imports still 31 per cent, compared with 24 per .cent, in 1938.110. The loss of supplies, resulting from the war and after-math of war in South-East Asia is also important.     There hasbeen direct loss of important foods - sugar, oilseeds, rice -which has forced European consumers,to seek supplies from theAmerican&quot; Continent-.     Perhaps even more significant, however,has been&quot;the drain upon the world&apos;s cereal resources to feedthese countries;    the fall in Burma&apos;s rice output has, forexample, forced, many Asiatic countries to import wheat to keep their peoples alive, and also to divert food for home con-sumption which would otherwise be exported.     Here again,this report assumes- a steady recovery in these Asiatic supplies during the period;   but the process is slow, and meanwhilethere is further pressure upon American sources.111. The effect.of this is that the participating countries and Western Germans1 must necessarily seek to develop largerimport programmes from the American Continent than they wouldhave done normally.     The following is the &quot;programme:-
TABLE 5.      Import Programme of the participating countries and Western Germany from the___American Continent/_i_____1938	1 948	1 951	Total 1948-51(0*000 millions at	prices	of July.	1,1947)Pood, feed,  fertiliser	3.3	3.4	13.7Coal	0.3	0.05	0.7Petroleum products55	0.5	0.55	2.2Iron and steel                     0.1	0.4	0.3	1.3Timber	0.3	0.2	1 .0Equipment covered by Technical Committees	1.1	0.6	3.other imports	3.3	3.1	12.9Total imports	9.2	8. 2	35.2Shipping services	0.6	0.3	1.7	9.8	8.5	36.9s Amounts required from	dollar	sources.	112. These imports are essential for the production programmes.The participating countries and Western Germany will need tomaintan a continuously high level of imports from the american continent long after 1951.      But there are some elements in this programme which are purely temporary in character and arisedirectly from the effects of war disruption upon the countries1own resources.      The chief examples are shipping, coal, nitrogenfertiliser and certain capital equipment.113*  In order to cover their shipping needs after allowing forthe shipping services which they can provide for themselves andfor one another, the participating countries and Western germany are estimated to require 10.3 million deadweight tons of dollartonnage in 1948.      This figure will be rapidly reduced to 2.million deadweight tons in 1951? which would substantiallyrepresent the shipping services to be rendered to the/participating^The figures of import requirements in this table are not necess-arily the same as the estimates of import requirements in dollarsgiven in the summaries of the Technical Committee Reports inAppendix II.      In this table, the figures refer to the import requirements of the participating countries and Western Germany,and exclude those of dependent overseas territories.     A summaryof the balance of payments position of the dependent overseas territories will be found in Table 9.     The TechnicalCommittees, on the other hand, nave in most cases included the dependent overseas territories in their estimates of import requirements.
0 -32- 93participating countries and Western Germany by the United Statesand other flags in the normal course of shipping trade.      Theneed for tankers will rise steadily with the expanding petroleumimports, but the needs which cannot be met by the participating countries from their own resources are not more than the UnitedStates oil industry would be expected to provide in the normal course of business for the transport of its trade with the participating countries and Western Germany.Ilk. The requirements of imports of United States coal willlikewise fall fast, as United Kingdom and Ruhr output expands,and as increased supplies come forward from Poland:-,TABLE 6.      Solid Fuel Import Requirements of the,rru:    ^Participating Countries(million tons)	1948	1?51Prom U.S.A.	41	6* Prom Poland35	17	32	58	37&apos;		^Including small amounts from other...countries.     The Polish figures are based upon estimates supplies by thePolish Government to the European CoalOrganisation.115* The programme for imports of capital equipment includesmarty items-which the participating countries would normallyproduce for thernselvjes, but which they cannot yet produce insufficient quantities to meet their needs over this period of rapid expansion.      These include mining equipment, electricalplant and freight qars, and also, in the first year,, a small amount of medium and light tractors.   . For all these itertfs the participating countries1and Western Germany will even in 1948be able to provide 80 per cent,  or more of their requirements,and their \Lmport requirements will fall steadily throughoutthe period from about    450 millions in 1948 to virtuallynothing in 1951.116.   Rather more important, however, are the special types of equipment and machinery which Europe does not produce and forwhich she will continue te rely on the United States.     Of these items, petroleum equipment and special steel plant will remainrelatively constant at $300 millions a year throughout theperiod, but the requirements of heavy tractors will, asagricultural re-equipment progresses, decline by 50 per cent.The total import requirement of equipment (temporary and long-term) in the field covered by the Technical Committees - thefculk of the total of equipment of all kinds - is $1,100 ^Billionsin.1948 and falls to  400 millions in 1 951 - a sum of  3,400millions for the four-year period, of which one-third isagricultural machinery.     Further requirements of equipment,ranging from replacement parts to complete machines, areincluded in &quot;other imports&quot;, and may be estimated at about 1 billion in the four years./ Petroleum
117.  Petroleum is one of the largest items;    as explained inparagraph^, a heavy increase in consumption is expected andthe total requirements of the participating countries and western Germany and their overseas territories are expected torise from 49 million tons in 1 947 to 78 million tons in 1951.The estimates have been prepared on the assumption of continuedrestrictions on gasoline consumption by private motorists.This expansion of petroleum consumption will bring consumptionper head up to only about 15 per cent, of that now ruling inthe United States.118. Of iron and steel imports, those for finished steel otherthan sheets and tinplates will only be required in the first year.     But the import demand for semi-finished steel and tin-plate will remain relatively constant throughout the period.&apos;A large part of the participating countries&apos;  import requirements for sheets may be able to be met from the Bi-Zone of Germany.Import requirements of raw materials required for steel making and, in particular, scrap will increase during this period.The import programme for the other raw material dealt with bythe Technical Committees - timber - has been related to theestimated available supplies.119*  Most of the &quot;other&quot; imports - that is, the imports not covered by the reports of the Technical Committees - are the rawmaterials normally needed for Europe1s economy.      They include a wide range of materials&apos;and semi-manufactures of which cotton and non-ferrous metals are particularly important.      import requirements of these raw materials will increase as productionexpands.      The estimates submitted by the various countries were scrutinised and in certain cases adjustments were made.Wherever projected imports in 1948 appeared to exceed in quantity the imports in 1938, the figures were examined and enquiries made.      For. a number of countries, however, 1938 wasa year of very low economic activity and requirements would be higher in-conditions of full employment and active productioneffort.      The estimates for wood pulp for paper-making werespecially examined and it was decided to reduce the statedoverall requirements in 1948-51 by 20 per cent, because of worldshortage of supplies;    this adjustment reduced the requirements to approximately the rate of supplies available in 1947.     Thefigures submitted by the countries estimating for years aheadare necessarily subject to error, for it is impossible to predict the course of. development of every industry.     But itis believed that the statements show accurately the order of magnitude.120.   The &quot;other&quot; imports contain in certain cases allowance for imports of manufactured consumer goods.      Those countries whichexpect to be able to afford a free import policy in 1951 withoutquantitative restrictions included an estimate of what theimports would be in such conditions;    those which expectcontinuing difficulty in maintaining their balance of paymentsdid not allow for more of these imports than they expected tobe * able to continue to afford after the end of 1951.     the policies underlying the import estimates of the various countries in this field are therefore not the same, for some can afford a more liberal import policy than others.      It is unlikely,however, that this difference in import policy in the estimates of manufactured goods imports significantly distorts the totalof the import programme./The
121       The import programme for food and feeding stuffs representsnot&apos;the requirements but an estimate of what will he availablefor the participating countries and Western Germany.     This Isshort of the requirements which were submitted by the countries these show exceptionally large import needs in 1947/48 because ofthe failure of the harvest:--TABLE 7.     Import Requirements of Pood and Feeding_Stuffs from, Non-Participating Countries(million tons)	1934/8	1946/7	1947/8	1950/1Bread grains	14.0	15.3	23.7	17.9Coarse grains	11.4	4.7	8.6	11,sugar	2.7	1.7	1.7	2.3Meat	1.7	1.6	2.1	2.5Fats (oil equivalent)	2.6	1.1	1.7	2.3Oilcake*	5.0	1.9	3.5	* 5.including the oilcake content of imported oilseeds.122,     This series of requirements is very modest in terms of consumption.   It provides in effect a maintenance in 1947/8 of theconsumption of bread grains.in 1946/7 of 158 Kg per year, comparedwith pre-war consumption per head of 196 Kg.    The import requirement for 1950/1, assuming full success of the agricultural programmes,is equivalent to bread consumption of 179 Kg. per head, or 7 per cenibelow pre-war; by then, the population will be 11 per cent, above pre-war-war, and this explains the inadequacy of the imports iio providea satisfactory consumption level.   Similarly the consumption levelsaimed at in 1950/1 in framing the import requirements of sugar, meat and fats are below the pre-war level though above that which is nowruling.    The average consumption figures conceal wide differences between the consumption of the various participating countries.The consumption per head, implied in the requirements is as follows:-TABLE 8.

TrKthe year 1 9jj7-/8^ite available- *supply for the participating countries and.&apos;&quot;Western Germany isestimated at about 20 million tons, and the Committee hasestimated abailability of 2.5-^iloJ*oxi^:tons^in the later years -the same imports as pre-war - but this could be bettered if an intensive production effort were made-by the &quot;e xporting countries^Actual supplies to consumers will therefore fall appreciablyshort of the levels in Table 7  in the current year - which is bound to set hack the European livestock-jprogrammes again.Even in 1951* cereal consumption will still be far below pre-war.Similar adjustments were made to the meat and oilcake requirements12U.  It is not possible to say in advance which cereals fromwhich source will go to which country.      It is thereforeimpossible to specify how much of the 20 million tons of cerealsin the current year and of the 25 million tons in the following years will be required from the United States,  or from any othersource.      A general division has been made,  however, in order to* &apos;calculate the financial figures in Table 5;   up to 20 million ofthe 25 million tons which is estimated to be available for europe in the next few years may come from the American Continent, andthe demand upon the United States might vary between 8 and 9million tons.     Although the total cereal Imports into Europe   .will not exceed pre-war, large imports will be needed from the-&apos;&apos;American ^Continent to make good the loss from other sources.--125&apos;  It must again be emphasised that if these estimates are carried out, even in four years&apos;  time the consumption of food inEurope will still be significantly below pre-war - even assumingfull success of the agricultural programmes.     The hard fact ofthis report is that there is not enough food in the world to giveEurope as much as it had pre-war,  and that even in 1951 supplies will still be very short, although the fats situation will be greatly relieved.126.  This analysis of Europe&apos;s import requirements from theAmerican Continent shows that the size of this programme resultsprimarily from the interruption of supplies from non-Americansources;    there are relatively few temporary imports the needfor which will rapidly decline,  and there are relatively fewlong-term imports for major capital projects.      Most,of theimports are needed for the day-to-day running of the ;Europeaneconomy.     Without these running supplies, life comes to a stop,and the working capital of Europe, far from being increased asit needs to be, will be exhausted.127.  This import programme, which is essential for the productioneffort, raises most difficult financial questions.      For itappears from the analysis that this is a long-continuing problem,and that the participating countries and Western Germany willnot be able substantially to reduce their imports from theAmerican Continent for a very long time to come, withoutreducing food standards to a point at which they damageindustrial and agricultural production and creating unemploymentfor lack of fuel and raw materials, and abandoning the productioneffort which is Europe&apos;s one hope of recovery.
FINAL DRAFT chapter vii the PROBLEM OF PAYMENTS28.   The payments problem is the financial counterpart of theunbalanced flow of goods and services across the Atlantic.The financial figures are the clearest means of illustratingand expressing the size of the problem that exists and itsbearing upon the common affairs of the participating countries and the United States.      It is not the purpose of this reportto propose solutions for this problem.      The Committee is hereconcerned to indicate the scale of the problem and to show thefinancial implications of the maladjustment between the productive power and resources of the American Continent andthose of the participating countries which has resulted fromthe war.29    For this purpose a common account has been prepared which shows the deficit of the participating countries and western germany in their trading relations with the American continent and with other non-participating countries.     This account hasbeen prepared on as realistic a basis as possible.      It must be emphasised that it is not the sum of individual balance ofpayments estimates submitted by the various participating countries.      Independent estimating leads to inconsistencies;all the countries would necessarily make different and incompat-ible assumptions about the supplies which they could expect toreceive from the various sources.      The account is thereforebased upon the common import programme described in the previouschapter, together with estimates on the income side supplied bythe individual countries.      The account is built primarily fromthe experts&apos; view of the prospective commodity supply to the participating countries as a &quot;whole, rather than from independent and unco-ordinated financial estimates from the individual countries.      In this way it presents a genuine picture of therelations between the participating countries and Western Germanyand the American Continent.30.   The analysis deals with trade with the American Continentrather than with trade with the United States itself.     Thereason for this is that Canada and Latin America in generalrequire to be paid for their supplies in United States dollarsor the equivalent, for their economies rest upon their ability to earn United States dollars by their exports to Europe inorder to pay for their import requirements from the United Statesitself.     Of course^ participating countries have to pay dollars for supplies from certain other non-participating countries, andthey cannot in general collect dollars for any export surplus which they may have with non-participating countries outside theAmerican Continent.     The problem is not confined to the american continent, but spreads round the world.      Nevertheless, the mainelement in the problem is the deficit with the american continent, and the Committee decided to express the problem inthese terms without going into the special conditions arising in trade with other, non-participating countries.&apos;31 The scale of the dollar problem in 1948, as revealed inthis common account, is illustrated in the following table:-
TABLE 1 .Balance of Payments,of the participating countries and Western G-ermany in 1948_(jZf&apos;000- millions)AmericanContinentOther non-participatingcountriesImports9.1 8-4.70ExportsNet surplus (+V or deficit (-)on invisible account+2.15+4.30-0.57+0.38Dependent territories,net surplus  (h-) or deficit (-)-0.45-0.22Total-8.05-0.24132. Unless means can be found&apos;of filling this gap, -Europe willbe unable to receive the flow of goods and services which itsrecovery requires, and a catastrophe will result.133* It must be emphasised that the table does no more thanillustrate the prospective size of the dollar deficit in 1948.It does not state how much special aid is required.      This is because some of the deficit can be covered by other means; .loans from the International Bank, to the extent that they are actually used in 1948, contribute towards filling the gap;    sodo other forms of lending;    so does the expenditure of other financial resources by the participating coizntries.     But at thesame time it is clear that these other resources can fill only a relatively small part of the gap, and most of the participating countries will have dollar payments to make in other parts ofthe world as well.134. The reasons why the deficit with the American Continent isof this size are explained in the appended report of the Balanceof Payments Committee.&apos;    The normal pattern of trade between the participating countries and Germany and the American Continentwas a substantial deficit against the former on trading account;,this deficit was $1,350 millions in 1938.      This adverse trade balance was offset by the participating countries&apos; earnings oninvisible account, by the sale of Colonial produce to theUnited States, and by earnings of dollars from sales to the restof the world.     This was the customary process of multilateral trade.135. All these factors have been distorted by the war.      Theforeign investment income is gone;    there is a big dollar billfor shipping services;    tourist income has not yet recovered.At the same time, the loss of other sources of supply has forcedEurope to turn to the American Continent for essential suppliesIon a much greater scale than &quot;before,  and prices have increasedIheavily;    the dislocation of industry by the war has tended to^damage particularly industries and agriculture which contributedmost to Europe&apos;s dollar income.      The destruction in the Japanese-war has turned the net income from sales of rubber, tin and other[dollar-earning colonial products into a net expenditure./Finally,
3D^Finally, the shortage of dollars generally has made it hardly possible for Europe to earn dollars by sales to the rest of theworld.     The size of the deficit results from the cumulative effect of all these forces.136,   The full effect of this is only now becoming apparent.In the first post-war year, much of Europe was still disorganisedand could neither get the supplies it needed nor would it havebeen in a position to make full use of them,.     Prices were still held down - a factor of great importance, for a change of only10 per cent, in Europe&apos;s import prices from the American Continentis equivalent   to   n e a r X y $1 ,000 millions a year.     Manyparticipating countries still had financial reserves, and therewere generous credits from the United States and Canada.      Inorder to get industrial and agricultural prodiiction under way,supplies are needed on a much larger scale than Europe had in1946.137-   In order to illustrate the size of the deficit with theAmerican Continent in another way, estimates were made by nine of the participating countries and the Bi-Zone of Germany oftheir 1948 current deficit with the American Continent.     these estimates were made by the countries themselves, on a number of specific assumptions, of which the most important were themaintenance of mid-1947 prices,  the full availability of supplies,and imports limited only in accordance with what the country would be able to afford at the end of 1951 - that is, the sameassumptions as were made for the import programme in the previouschapter.      The results do not of course represent thesecountries&apos; forecasts of what their deficits will be in the year1948 on their present policies, for most of the participating countries are now forced by sheer necessity to work on quite different assumptions:.      The following are the figures:-TABLE10.      Deficit of Certain Participating countries and the Bi-Zone of&quot; Germany with the- American Continent______________in 1948_______( &apos;000 millions)Belgium	0.32Denmark	0.21France	1 .76Bi-Zone of Germany	1 .1 5Greece	0.51Italy	0. 93Netherlands	0.63Norway	0.05Sweden	0,1 united Kingdom .	2.63
138.   The total of these figures is 08,3h0 millions.      WhenAdjustment is made for the participating countries which werefinable to supply this information, for the lack of availability of supplies and for the deficit of the dependent territories,this total is broadly consistent with the common account inTable 9..    It must be emphasised that these figures do not represent the need of each country for special aid;    the deficitwith the American Continent is the largest ielement in the dollarproblem of every country, but there are special circumstances inevery case,139    The purpose of the European recovery programme is toreduce the dol.lar deficit progressively from -1948 to the endof 1951.      The deficit will continue to be very large duringthis period, for the productive effort generated in 1948 can be sustained and developed further only if the necessary supplies from overseas are forthcoming and adequate financial arrangements are made.140   In order to illustrate the rate .at which it could be reasonably expected that the deficit would fall - assumingfavourable external conditions and in particular a steady fallin the.price of imports from the American Continent - a common .account was prepared on the same lines as that for 1948 asfollowsTABLE i1._Deficit with the American Continent 1948-51($?000 millions)1 948	8,051949	6,351 950	4=651951	3.45Total	22,5141. The estimates which support this figure are set out inthe report of the Balance of Payments Committee,      Once againit must be noted that this is an. illustrative deficit,  some ofwhich could be covered by the International Bank.      The valueof imported equipment included in imports -of commoditiescovered by Technical Committees during the period 1948-51  isabout 03.k billion, and the value of imports of equipment notdealt with by the Technical Committees may be roughly estimatedat about 01 billion.      These figures include agricultural machinery, mining supplies and a wide range of maintenance and replacement suppl:&apos; ,sj    the amount attribiitable to new capital projects probauly does not exceed 0     billion (seeparagraph 116) t
142.   The report of the International BankH shows the important part which the Bank would he able to play, though it is notpossible to estimate in figures what&apos;that part might be duringthe four-year period.      Some of this deficit too could be covered by private investment or by the repatriation of capitalafter the restoration of internal financial stability.      It isclearly desirable that the largest possible contribution shouldbe made from these sources, but it must be noted that private investment projects do not contribute to the problem in theterms in which it has been expressed above if the proceeds are used for the purchase of imports of capital equipment which arenot provided for in the present national plans.143.   The progressive annual reduction of the deficit reflects the fall in the participating countries need for certain types of imports from the American Continent, partly as a result of increased production in Europe and partly because of the availability of more supplies from the rest of the world.     of equal importance, however, is the growth, of exports to theAmerican Continent which is the only means, in the long run, bywhich the participating countries can maintain their importsfrom the American Continent.      The following table shows the.export development which is provided for in the analysis:-TABLE 12.      Exports to the American Continent 1948-51	(0*000	millions)	.&apos;       U. S.A.	Rest of American Continent1948	0.85	1.311949	1.11	1 .721 950	1.23	2.141 951	1 .48	2.46/144*The following is an extract from the report of the international bank dated 12th September, 1947:-&quot;The role of the Bank w$ich is to help solve theproblems which have been sketched, will become clearer once the nature and scope of any aid to be given under the MarshallPlan becomes known.      But it is apparent already that the -Bahk&apos;s part will not be limited&apos;to assistance in financing the importation of machinery and equipment.      Just as import-ant as the restoration of capital facilities is the restora-tion to normal^levels of Europe&apos;s depleted stocks of indust-rial raw materials.      The normal inventory of such materialsis an essential part of capital:     the re-building of suchinventories is an integral part of reconstruction.If the European Nations themselves take the necessary steps to lay a firm foundation for reconstruction, ifadequate aid is given by the United   States to enable thosenations to surmount the immediate obstacles, the loans ofthe Bank should prove an invaluable aid in revitalising theEuropean productive mechanism.      If this can be accomplished,the effects will be felt throughout the world and the economies of all the Bank&apos;s members will benefit accordingly.&quot;
0144* At the end of the period, again on favourable assumptions,it is estimated that the participating countries and western germany will have a substantial surplus on current account withother non-participating countries.     For the year 1951  this isestimated at $1,800 millions.      If there is a sufficient flow of dollars to the rest of the world to enable the participating countries to earn dollars or their equivalent for this surplus,it will be possible to offset this surplus against the dollar deficit with the American Continent.      This would indeedrepresent a restoration of the normal means by which Europedealt with its dollar deficit.      But it implies that all othercountries in the world must be able to earn enough dollars forthis purpose.     Given such conditions, the participating countries and Western Germany would be close to a balance by.theend of 19.51 amd such deficit which continued to exist wpuld beof dimensions which would be manageable without special;aid.145. The facts revealed by the Committee&apos;s analysis, however,show that the problem of Europe&apos;s deficit with the American.Continent is one which will take four years to solve, and whichcannot, ultimately be solved until the basic maladjustment whichcauses it has been righted.     This maladjustment, of which the dollar shortage is the symptom, is a potential danger to the stability of the post-war world.      It is not only a problem ofEurope and the American Continent;    it is a problem of thebalance of the whole world economy.146.  The European recovery programme can go part of the way toprovide a solution.      The expansion of production in the participating countries and in Western Germany on the scaleenvisaged in Chapter III will make possible a reduction in imports from the American Continent of goods which these countries can produce efficiently and have normally produced in the past&quot;.The development of production in dependent territories will havethe same effect.     The modernisation of European industry will increase these countries  ability to produce goods on an efficient and competitive basis and thus be able to achieve a rapid expansion of exports to the American Continent.147.  But the action which the participating countries can take is limited.     The power to correct the maladjustment is not theirsalone.     The maladjustment can never be corrected on abasis  of expanding trade unless   market conditions in the american continent permit Europe to sell goods there in steadily increasing quantities and permit other countries to earn dollarsthere and use them to purchase from Europe.      The participating countries will undoubtedly be able to stand on their own feet if all currencies in, the rest of the world are convertible, and ifthe trade pattern is such that they can remain convertible.The solution of the world problem is decisive for the participating countries&apos; future.      In the initial period of theEuropean recovery programme,  the contribution to this worldproblem which Europe can make by its own exertions is of prime importance.      But as the four-year period develops, the worldconsiderations rather than those of European production itselfwill be decisive.
- hZ -N FINAL DRAFT chapter VIII.CONCLUSIONS1U8.    In this report the participating countries have setout their line of approach to the problem that confrontsthem.    The discussions in Paris have resulted in the formu-lation in common of a European recovery programme.     Thetask is so great that it cannot be brought to completion in less than four years.    But although the object will takefour years to complete, it will go forward by a series ofstages, the achievement of each of which will bring Europenearer the goal.li+9.    This recovery programme is based upon four lines ofaction:-(i) a strong production effort by each of the participat-ing countries(ii) the creation of internal financial stability;(iii) the maximum co-operation between the participating countries;(iv) the solution of the continuing problem of the participating countries trading deficit with theAmerican continent,150.    These are described in detail in the report.    the participating countries are determined to get out of their difficulties as far as they can by their own hard work andexertions., and the four-yuar programme will restore thepre-war level of agricultural production in the participat-ing countries as a whole and will exceed it in coal, steel and manufacturing industry generally.    The scale of this effort will ,not only solve the immediate production problembut will also provide the basis for a further lifting ofLuropean production in the following years to levels never-before contemplated in Europe,    This is the foundation for a sound and workable European economy.151.    The creation of internal financial stability in cer-tain countries is a necessary condition for the accomplish-ment of their production programmes and for their full co-operation with other participating countries.    Incertain cases undertakings have been given by the govern-ments concerned of their resolve to carry out a programmeof stabilisation as part of the Luropean recovery programme;the process would be greatly eased by supplementary exter-nal aid.152.    The expansion of production will involve&apos;, continuouslyincreasing measures of mutual help between .the participating countries, which will reduce their dependence upon the restof the world.      The maximum use will be made of the participating countries&apos; own raw material resources and productive capacity.      This process will be stimulated bythe measures which will be taken to secure progressiverelaxation of import restrictions and&quot;to improve-the payment/arrangements
- 1*3 -arrangements between the participating countries.    tariff barriers are less important at present, but many of the participating countries are now engaged upon negotiationsfor multilateral tariff reductions and arrangements have beenmade for examining the possibility of creating CustomsUnions between some or all of the participating countries.In addition to this general co-operation, there are anumber of specific pieces of mutual help which have been organised at Paris, particularly in the common planning ofthe use of natural resources.153.    Arrangements have been made for continuing this workof mutual help begun in Paris, both through the normalUnited Nations machinery in Europe and through the establish-ment of a joint continuing organisation of the participating countries charged with the task of reviewing progress madewith the execution of the recovery programme.154.   Even efter taking full account of the supplies whichthey can produce for themselves and v/hich they can hope toobtain from the rest of the world, the participating coun-tries will require large quantities of food, fuel, rawmaterials and capital equipment from the /jnorican Continent,This flow of goods is vitally necessary to the success ofthe whole recovery progremme - production, stabilisation andco-operation.    If no means can be found of enabling thtsparticipating countries to receive those goods and services which they need, the results which would follow would becalamitous.    Already one European country after another isbeing forced by the sheer pressure of lack of dollars to cut down vital imports of fool and raw materials from theAmerican Continent,    If nothing, is done a catastrophe will develop as stocks become exhausted.    If too little is done it will be impossible to provide the momentum which is needed to get the recovery programme under way and many ofthe participating countries will bo forced to eke out a precarious existence, and to abandon the possibility of restoring their position by constructive effort,155,   Adequate aid in 1948 is of decisive importance, forthe programme cannot begin without these supplies.     the combined deficit with the American Continent in 1948 is08 billions.    This is not stated in the report as a request for special aid to that extent, for some of the deficit maybe covered by other means such as loans from the international bank, private investment, or other means.    This figure is,however, less than requirementsj its size is attributablemore to lack of supplies available from Eastern Europe,South-East Asia and other non-European sources than to anincrease in the total import requirements of the participat-ing countries.156,    A continuing flow of goods and services will be re-quired from the American Continent in the further period1949-51 but at a steadily falling rate.     The total dollar deficit over the four-year period 1948-51 is - estimated at022,5 billions, part of which can be met from the Inter-national Bank and other sources than special aid.      these estimates contain no extravagant importing&apos;; food consumption at the end of the period will be less than the pre-war level per head and the estimates are framed on the basis that gasoline rationing and,  in.many countries, food and clothing rationing will continue throughout.
- kh -157.    In the. last year, 1951, the estimates show a deficitwith the jjnerican Continent of 8&apos;3*5 &quot;billions.      Given favour-able world conditions which will enable the participating countries to earn dollars by their sales to non-american countries, this figure wuuld imply that the participating countries would be near balance by the end of 1951.Certainly the deficit after the end of 1951* on these assump-tions, should be of dimensions which will be manageablewithout special aid.158.    The Committee&apos;s analysis of the payments problem betweenthe participating countries and the American Continent showsthat the task of achieving and maintaining a balance ii* a formidable one, which the participating countries cannotsolve by their own efforts alone.    They can and will make their full contribution to its accomplishment.    By increasing their production, by stabilising their internal economy, andby helping each other, they can reduce, over a period oftime, the amount of supplies which they need to buy from theAmerican Continent.    By modernising, and developing their production they can produce goods for export.    But no balancecan be reached at a high level of trade unless the market conditions allow these goods to be sold.159*    The problem which the Committee of Co-operation hasbeen working to solve in Paris is the aftermath of the war.The Committee now submits its proposals for the necessaryrestorative action on the European side by production,stabilisation and co-operation between the participating countries.     These are reinforced by definite and specificundertakings by each of the countries concerned that it will play its part in the programme,160*    But restorative action cannot begin without the neces-sary goods and services from the American Continent. .Europe&apos;s dollar resources are running low.    Unless means canbe found of enabling the flow to continue, economic life inEurope will become more unstable and uncertain;  industry will gradually come to a standstill for lack of materials and fuel, and the food supply will gradually disappear.161*    The United States is the only country in the worldwhich can make the means of recovery available to Europe.In the last two years Europe has received much from theUnited States; the help which has been received has savedEurope from calamity.    But the size of the problem has proved greater than was expected; the destruction of the war .was greater and the obstacles to recovery more formidablethan was expected even six months ago.    In this report the participating countries have set out the facts as they seethem.    They have formulated a recovery programme.    In framingit they have sought to reduce their needs from the american continent to the minimum.    It is for the American people,through its Congress, to decide whether in America&apos;s own interests and in those of the world at large the means shouldbe found, of supplying these needs and thus of enabling theEuropean economy to move forward towards a sound and stablefuture.
