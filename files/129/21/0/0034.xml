THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS 3RIT/JMIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(h7)   28k COPY NO.1-2I6TH OCTOBER.  19U7&apos; CABINET- REPORT OP THE INVESTMENT PROGRAMMES committee note by. ,the Minister for Economic affairs circulate for the consideration of my colleagues the Report of the Investment Programmes Committee togetherwith a note- by the Central Economic Planning Staff and theEconomic Section of the Cabinet Office.      This Report hasalready been before the Production Committees  the EconomicPlrnning Board end the Official Committee on economic development for preliminary discussion;2* As a result of this preliminary discussion,  certain minor points have been remitted to the Ministers concerned forfurther discussion.     These points are set out in the annex tothis paper.      The major points thrown out for furtherconsideration no?/ are as follows:-(a) GeneralAll three Committees expressed general agreement withthe reductions in investment proposed in the Report as a minimum.The Official Committee on Economic Development expressed doubt as to whether the Report went far enough, but considered thatit was clear thct nothing less than the reduction proposed would suffice to bring the Investment Programme into balance;they, felt that it may even be necessary later to make further reductions-,(b) Housing;:The Official Committee on Economic Development regarded it as essential to get the housing programme into balance as quickly as possible and were convinced that nothing short of a drastic reduction in the number of houses started would suffice to do this.     They considered that the target for the rate of starting new houses should be between 5,000 a month recommended in the Report end 7*000 a month,  bearing in mind that the aluminium houses would be outside the limit-The Minister of Health is   unable to accept theproposals with regard to housing and considers that the right course is for the Cabinet to fix a total housing programme of180,000 to 200,000 houses a year and to leave it to theSecretary of State for Scotland and himself to adjust the rate -at which contracts for new houses are approved, in such a way as to bring house building into a state, of balance at this-level of output by the middle of 19^9.     He considers thatrestricting the number of houses to be started each month to5*000 will make it impossible to maintain a balanced programme
in those areas of - the country where the programme is now in balance.In my opinion the housing programme must be related to the   prospective supply of timber which is the limiting factor.     After taking into account the increased timberrequirements of export and other priority programmes the/proposed cut of  5 millions in timber imports from dollar sources and a drawing down of stocks by 25*000 standards inI9I48 and in 19h9,  the amount of timber available for housingnext year will be rbout 230,000 standards-      This is sufficientto sustain a programme of li40,000 houses a year.     The housing programme should,  in ray view, be fixed at this level rnd theMinister of Health should be invited to take suitable measuresto reduce by mid-19^4-9 the existing stock of unfinished houses to a level commensurate with this rate of building, say,130,000 to 150,000 houses, due provision being made within these figures for the priority needs of mining and agricultural workers.- II(0) Indust rial BuiIdingThe Official Committee on Economic Development also recommended the acceptance of the total scale of cuts in industrial building but stressed that there should be theutmost flexibility in administering the cuts.     They thoughtit wrpiig to give a blanket preference for Development Areafactories but considered that these should be given the benefitof the doubt in assessing the claims of particular schemes tobe allowed to go ahead.The Production Committee felt that the proposals relating to industrial building should be accepted subjectto the continuance of the existing preferential treatment ofthe development areas within the reduced programme for completingindustrial building projects already started.3* Other points raised in preliminary discussion were:-(i) The Economic Planning.Board recommended that higherprovision should be made for technical education and that theproposed cuts in the programme for disabled persons factoriesshould be avoided if possible.(ii) The Economic Planning Board also had misgivings aboutthe cuts proposed in gas and electricity and were afraid thatcuts in transport vehicles might hinder mobility of labour.(iii) It was agreed generally that, as recommended by the investment Programmes Committee,  there should be continuedsupervision of &quot;the Investment programme.      This proposal requires to be endorsed by the Cabinet.The note by the Central Economic Planning Staff and theEconomic Section shows that the steel balance obtained if therecommendations of the Report are adopted will still be veryprecarious in the first six months of 19U8.      The note suggeststhat immediately the proposals of the Committee have beenadopted a further study should be made of the requirements ofthe engineering industry for home and export in order to ascertain whether it is necessary to bake further cuts in investment orto rebalance the export programme.     My view is that these recommendations should be endorsed5!R. S * C.Great Georr-e Street, 8.W.I.,16th October, 19U7.

Copy NoJREPORT OF THE INVESTMENT PROGRAMMES committee note by the Central Economic Planning Staff and the Economic section. The Report of the Investment Programmes Committee discloses (a) thathome investment has been planned and started on a scale well beyond our capacity to carry out at reasonable speed with the materials hitherto available, and (&amp;) thatthe prospective supplies of the more important materials for the coming year are inadequate to sustain the. current actual rate of investment and meet theneeds of the export and other essential home programmes.2. We believe that the Committee&apos;s proposals on building and civil engineering are calculated to adjust these programmes to a level commensurate with the prospective supplies of materials that can be made available and to clear the course for the more important projects to go ahead at a faster pace. Therecommendations should, we think, be accepted and implemented rigorously andwithout delay.3.. In the plant and machinery sector the problem is much more complex.The key factor is steel. Prospective steel supplies are hedged around with muchuncertainty. There is no less uncertainty about the requirements of steel for investment and other purposes a situation which is not eased by the absence of quantitative programmes over a large part of the field. Furthermore, sincethe Committee was appointed, the Government has announced its export plan,which is heavily weighted on the side of engineering. This not only makesincreased demands for steel but also imposes severe restrictions- on the flow ofcapital goods for home investment.4. The Committee has succeeded in striking a rough balance between thedemand for and supply of steel for the first half of 1948, though the balance is somewhat precarious. It depends on the attainment by the steel industry of the14 million ingot ton target about which we cannot as yet be wholly confident.We have still to get the full measure of the impact which the export plan maymake on steel. We do not know what drain there may be on our steel resources to buttress bilateral trade negotiations. For the second half of the year the uncertainties both as regards requirements and supplies are still greater.5. The Committee&apos;s proposals in this field, therefore, are certainly notexcessive and further cuts may be inevitable when the steel picture becomes clearer.The Committee&apos;s proposals are, however, in the right direction and certainlyshould be accepted.6. If we look beyond the end of 1948, there is little prospect of early relief.The export requirements for steel will not diminish, since the end 1948 targets,,once achieved, have not only to be maintained but increased. Virtually all ofthe basic industries&apos; re-equipment programmes are on a rising curve and the levelof re-equipment in private industry, which the Investment programmes committee proposes for 1948, is well below what one could wish on along-term basis.7. On these wider matters, which lay somewhat outside the Committee&apos;sprovince, we suggest the following conclusions : 1(a) Every effort must be made to guarantee the 14 million ton steel ingotoutput for 1948, and in addition technical examination should bemade to see whether it can possibly be surpassed by the use. of everyform of temporary expedient;(5) Efforts should be concentrated on those elements of the iron and steeldevelopment programme which will produce more steel quickly, ratherthan on those designed primarily to economise fuel and labour;34332
(c) A constant look out should be kept for means of increasing importsof steeh from non-dollar sources, if increased imports from dollar sources are impracticable for balance of payments reasons;id) The utmost importance attaches to economy in the use of steel, and machinery for ensuring this should be examined and overhauled,particularly on the technical side;*(e) The uncertainties about steel supplies for both engineering exports and investment are such that we shall probably be faced with the choice of cutting investment programmes still further or readjusting theexport plan. As regards the former we are most reluctant to seeinvestment in plant and machinery reduced below the levels suggestedin the Report. As regards the latter we have considerable doubt whether the marginal engineering exports are, in fact, attainableor whether, if attained, these marginal exports will be paid for inacceptable currencies. For these reasons we consider that the export programme may have to be rebalanced by expanding exports thatdo not make a call on steel and reducing the emphasis now placedon the engineering industry. Thus by increasing still further theexport contribution of the textile industry we should transfer the choice from the investment to the consumption sector. This shouldbe studied;.(/) As a complementary measure within the engineering field, it may bepossible to concentrate to a greater extent on those types of exportwhich use relatively less steel per unit of value. This also shouldbe examined.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th October, 1947.

INVESTMENT PROGRAMMES COMMITTEEREPORTWE were appointed by a minute of the Secretary of the Cabinet (CP. (47)231) to carry out the instructions given by the Cabinet (CM. (47) 68th Conclusions(2) and (3)) to the Central Economic Planning Staff to work out proposals for reducing investment.   Our terms of reference were: -&quot; (i) To review the size of the total investment programme, both building and plant and machinery, and to make proposals as to the extentto which the programmes of Departments require modification,(ii) To obtain from Departments a statement of the steps necessary to carryout these proposals and of the effect on their programmes.(iii) To submit a comprehensive review to Ministers.(iv) To supervise methods of controlling and reducing total programmesthrough  labour  ceilings,   expenditure  limits,   material  supplies,licences or any other methods which are necessary,(v) To make proposals as to the relative priorities which departments should observe in dealing with existing and new projects.&quot;Main, objectives2. This review of investment programmes has two main objectives, whichwere set out in the Chairman&apos;s letter of. 15th August to Heads of Departments(I.P.C. (47) 2).   These were :-&quot; (i) There is the need which appears to exist, independently of any cut inthe current level of activity in the investment industries, to concen-trate effort on the smaller total of projects so that progress withinthe approved total may be more rapid,(ii) There is the need further to adjust programmes to take account ofa smaller scale of activity in investment that is now being proposed.&quot;The first objective is simple and clear: recognising that existing suppliesof materials are not enough to finish all kinds of investment (ships, machinery,houses, schools, generating stations and so on) which have been started, wemust concentrate the national effort on finishing the most important jobs, and prevent new projects starting unless they are absolutely essential. present difficulties are well known in both the building and plant and machinery sectors of investment- too much work is started and then held up becausematerials do not arrive on time, labour is often above the numbers needed to use available supplies of materials efficiently. The result is that moreand more materials of all kinds are being put into an ever growing totalof unfinished work while the amount actually completed lags deplorably.In the building sector 13 months are now required to,complete a house ascompared with 8 months two years ago, while in July there were 50,000 moreunfinished houses in existence than the Government had intended at thebeginning of the year to have at its end. In the plant and machinery sector the effects of over-issuing M-Forms for steel are notorious and constantly stultifythose of our programmes which depend on the planned use of steel. A restraint of investment is not the only cure for these ills, but it is unquestionably themost important single part of the remedy; it would make an overwhelmingdifference to the possibility of getting rid of these major obstacles to effectiveplanning, and in particular would greatly ease the task of getting priorityplans finished quickly. The first objective is thus essentially one of improving the administration of the investment programme--to ensure that no more work is started than can be completed at a proper speed.3. The second objective goes much further: it is to reduce the demandsof home investment for steel, coal, timber and other materials in order toprovide greater quantities for the export programme and other vital needs.This second objective accordingly means a real cut in the current level of workand not tihe paper cut in the hopes of departments involved in the first objective.Recently the Tjnited Kingdom has maintained the pattern of its economy by
borrowing abroad at the rate of  600 million a year. As this borrowing ceases,,the heeds formerly supplied by it must be met either by increased output Or by reduction of consumption at home or by reduction, of investment. We may expect some contribution from each of these. The coming reduction of the armed forces is expected to do more than offset the expected decline in the working population and so add to the employed labour force; we may also reasonablycount on an increase in output per head as the. post-war economic pattern pro-gressively develops. Finally, we may assume some reduction in employment ofmen and materials for less essential consumption in the home market,, partly as aresult of counter-inflationary measures designed to reduce demand and partly as a direct consequence of raising export targets without corresponding increases!of production.4. There is not in practice complete freedom of choice between these alter-natives. The contribution from increased production is limited in the short run by limits&apos;to our basic supplies of steel, eoal and many other materials. Thus theneeds of the export industries must be met from contractions either of investmentor of home consumption, and where the essential materials are not largely usedfor home consumption:, the heaviest cut must fall on investment. This is mostimmediately true of steel, but other important materials of the industriesproviding for investment (building, engineering and shipbuilding) are alsoaffected rather more indirectly, but with similar results timber and paintthrough the need to limit our imports from lack of foreign exchange, and bricksand cement through the increasing cOal requirements of industry. To this extent,therefore, our proposals are designed primarily to make it possible to carry outin the least painful manner existing decisions about exports and import savingtargets. Moreover, these targets in themselves require&apos;, tb! the extent that they need increased exports of capital equipment, corresponding reductions of homeinvestment, if production cannot be readily stepped up. In certain cases we have gone further than the existing targets and proposed increased exports of sometypes of plant and machinery, where a supply is left to the home market even- afteffthe attainment of the new export targets greater than can be justified in thepresent stringency.Supplies of Materials5. We have carefully examined forward estimates of raw material supplies and reached conclusions on the basis of present expectation of supplies likelyto be available in June 1948.- If these are- not reached, it will be necessary toimpose still bigger cuts than those we propose.(.,,. Timber.-About half th6 -supplies of softwoods are-required for building;greater amounts must be made available for packing exports during 1948 and somecuts in imports may be essential for currency reasons. We are most reluctant to see supplies reduced below the needs of houses already started&quot; and of thesmaller number of houses which we think could be started; during next year, andconclude that, provided programmes of investment are scaled down as we propose, there will be just enough timber, for them; on the present import programme (Appendix 19).Bricks and Cement.-. As a start we think that, current output rates&quot; of both&quot;should be continued&apos;because the effects of the proposed cuts in &quot;building will not be felt for some time; moreover there should be some counterbalancing rise in productivity. Later, however, when the results of the outs are clear, some reduc-tions in output may be possible, particularly of cement;Steel. Increased demands for exports and priority programmes will out-weigh the expected rise in production. The resulting deficit cam Only&apos; be met by heavy cuts in steel fpr building,; smaller cuts in other programmes and a realistic re-assessment of programmes outside- the investment field which makecalls on. steel (Appendix 19). *Productivity6. We think- that there: should&apos; be a rise: in&apos; productivity as; a result of our proposals,, when resources of men: and materials- have been: brought closer together than they are now. The frustrations: described in paragraph 2 have1certainly been, at the bottom, of complaints about productivity and consequentlyan end to them should, together with the goodwill of all parties concerned, bringabout, a definite, rise in productivity %
Results Summarised7. In the light-of these prospects we have examined all departmental pro-grammes as thoroughly as time has allowed. For various reasons we have hadto treat the Building programmes and Plant and Machinery programmesseparately; the general conclusions and arguments on each are set out in Parts and III, but the whole is summarised in the following table which gives estimates of the United Kingdom production of capital goods for investment in 1947 and \1948. It must be emphasised that the figures are broad estimates which mustbe treated with reserve; they inevitably contain a good deal of &quot; informed guess-work &apos;&apos; because the statistics of investment are scanty and the problems of handling them peculiarly intractable.Gross Investment in the United Kingdom*(  million)Mid-1947 Year 1948 End 1948AnnuaTrate     Forecast as made     Proposed(approximate)   in Economic Survey annual rateA.

Direct labour forces, &amp;c.    ...        122 135 93H. Temporary houses    ...      ... 50 30 ...In broad terms, the main results of our proposals are as follows :-(1) Gross capital investment at home was forecast in the draft economic survey for 1948-51 at  1,600 million in the whole of 1948. This repre-sented the expected achievement during the year and is considerably less than the sum of programmes to which Departments have been trying to work, and which have been the subject of our scrutiny.(2) At about the middle of 1947 it is estimated that gross investment athome w;as running at the rate of about  1,500 million a year.(3) The cuts proposed in this Report bring down gross investment to a rateof  1,300 million at the end oi 1948, which corresponds to an actualinvestment over the calendar year 1948 of about  1,400 million.(4) We are, therefore, proposing to cut investment programmes in 1948  150million below the present achievement, and by about  200 millionbelow a fairly realistic forecast of what might have been achieved in1948, and by very much more on programmes which Departments areattempting, but would certainly have failed, to achieve next year.All the figures given above relate to gross investment at home, that is, they include both repair and maintenance and new capital investment in buildings,plant and machinery. While the extent of the proposed cuts in gross capital investment would be at the rate of nearly one-fifth of the previously estimatedrate of achievement by the end of 1948, the reduction in new capital investment would be much higher than this, probably about one-third.Other Measures8. These figures bring together our detailed proposals on particular pro-grammes. Wherever possible we indicate detailed means for carrying them out,but we wish to make two general points at this stage. We have mentioned in para-graph 3 the effect of counter-inflationary measures on restraining consumption,and it is clear that a damping down of the general inflationary pressure over thewhole economy would greatly help in the task of reducing demand in any part ofit, including investment. But we wish to point out that in some respects existingfiscal measures have been deliberately designed to stimulate investment with aview to accelerating post-war reconstruction and industrial re-equipment.   For* Production in the United Kingdom of capital goods for gross investment at home. Importsof capital goods, which are small, are excluded.
instance, the Income Tax Act, 1945, offers strong financial incentives for initiatingcapital expenditure and the preferential rate of profits tax on undistributedprofits encourages the reinvestment of profits in the business. If our recommenda-tions are accepted, it will mean that, for the time being, the Government ismodifying its general policy of encouraging industrial modernisation andre-equipment. There are also various other matters, not confined to the industrial field, in which existing financial arrangements encourage a high rather than a low rate of investment. We think it will be necessary, generally speaking, to review the effects of the present report on the various financial measures whichhave a bearing on the rate of investment in order to ensure that the physical andthe financial aspects of investment policy are in harmony with each other.9. Nearly all our proposals are related mainly to programmes for 1948, butwe recognise that, particularly in the building field, they imply changes in theuse and distribution of man-power that will make it impossible for home invest-ment to increase rapidly in 1949 and 1950. We do not believe that it is practic-able at present to draw up anything approaching a detailed investment pro-gramme further ahead than we have done. That task should be undertaken in afew months&apos; time. Meanwhile, we recommend that Departments should provi-provisionally assume, except in the cases of the main priority programmes, that no substantial increases from the levels proposed should be expected.10. We have been convinced by our enquiry into building programmes thatthe future prospects for the supply of materials mean not only that further expansion should be stopped, but also that new works programmes already over-load the capacity of the building industry and should be curtailed. The generalresult of our proposals would be to meet in full or slightly increase building programmes for coal and agriculture, but to make-drastic reductions elsewhere.We are under no delusions about the sharp reversals of policy involved, but webelieve that it is within the power of Departments to carry out these proposals.We do not hesitate to put them forward because we are convinced that failure to do so wili increase the dangers of being faced with much more difficultcircumstances before long. Heaviest cuts must in our view fail upon the housing and industrial building programmes which make up 60 per cent, and 12^ percent, respectively of the total and also provide the great bulk of the new work.maintenance, where further cuts would in many cases produce a disastrousdeterioration in our national capital; moreover, the heavier the cut on new works,the greater the need to make do and mend with what we already have. On roadworks, however, we think a reduction of maintenance is very necessary forspecial reasons.11. For housing our proposals would reduce the rate of starting new housesfrom 15,000 a month to 5,000 a month (mainly for mining and farming areas) for at least a year. Approvals should be reduced to correspond. The purpose of thisis to help reduce the vast and growing stock of unfinished houses and houses under contract, now numbering 360,000. When this stock has been reduced to a mariage-able level, the rate of starting new houses could be raised again, provided it wasclosely fitted to the supplies of materials then expected to be available; the exactrate would have to be settled later when this was known, but we think11,000-12,000 a month might be possible. Meanwhile we believe that houses can continue to be finished at about the present rate of 12,000 a month. A reductionin the rate of approving new houses will, however, not be enough in itself andit will also be necessary to delay starting houses contracted for but not under construction, and in some areas stop houses which have not yet reached thedamp-course level. A detailed explanation of the steps proposed is given inAppendix 1.12. Steps of even greater severity are proposed in order to bring industrial building work into order. This is the most prominent example of starting more work than could have been completed within reasonable time, even with currentsupplies of materials. For instance, in the North-West region alone only 38 percent, of all licensed industrial building jobs costing over  10,000 are more thanone-quarter complete. In the Development Areas which contain half of all factory building approved since 1944 only 40 per cent, has been started and a mereII. Building and Civil Engineering ConstructionWe believe also that this newrather than building
6 per cent, completed. Moreover, it is on industrial, building that the cut in steelbears most heavily. Consequently we are proposing that for a period of at least six months only factories of most exceptional importance should be started, andthat resources should be concentrated on completing those projects now underway which are of most importance to the export drive.13. Proposals affecting other departments are set out briefly below. Detailswill be found in the Appendices :-&apos;(a) Agriculture.-Aa. increase is recommended, but doubts are expressed about the possibility of getting more labour, inview o  the competition from rural housing programmes, unless special administrative steps are taken..(b) Civil Aviation. Programmes of improvement for most airfields shouldstop and work on the London. Airport and most of the maintenancebases; slowed down.(c) Education-The full increase in demands for building arising; from present programmes cannot be accepted in view of the overall shortage.The level proposed is considerably higher than the present scale of activity but still about two-thirds of the departments&apos; requirements.(d) Fuel and Power (including North of Scotland Hydro-Electric. Board).-These building programmes depend on matching them with suppliesof plant. Special measures will be needed to carry them out but the implications&quot; for building have yet to be worked out in full. Therewill be a substantial saving on electricity generating stations buildingas a result of the reduction proposed in the section on plant and machinery.   The saving will start to appear in 1948.(e) Health Departments (excluding housing) An increase of about one-thirdis recommended to cover essential requirements not now being met;these are mainly water and sewerage schemes.(/) Home Departments. Scarcely any essential new work is required so thatprogrammes may be reduced to essential maintenance, except forshelter demolition likely to yield steel scrap.(g) Post  Office. Work should be reduced to a level allowing for theminimum of essential replacements and maintenance, together with small new works to meet essential needs; this will involve keeping the400,000 present applicants waiting much longer for telephones throughthe postponement of new exchanges as well as of duet work.(h) Transport. Heavy reductions in new works on roads and railways andin road maintenance are proposed. Many large projects can be post-poned without serious economic inconvenience while road maintenanceis one of the few sources of labour for rural housing and agriculture.(i) Works. No expansion of either direct Government work or of civillicensing beyond the present levels can be recommended. The formerwill involve postponing many schemes of Government buildingincluding some new permanent offices and &quot; Eemploy &quot; factories; thelatter will mean sharp reductions, e.g., in office building, which willparticularly affect blitzed cities.(j) Defence Services. A slight reduction in the Services building; taken together, is proposed after allowing for work done by their own staffs.This involves restriction to maintenance and to&apos; very few essential new works, mainly in replacement of buildings destroyed during the war.Further reductions may be possible later,14i. The foregoing proposals are based on calculations of the amount oflabour which can be fully employed with the greatest amounts of materials whichmay be expected to be available during 1948. These calculations^ show, first, thatthe 985,000* operatives available at the end of July were themselves in excessof the number to whom we think full employment could be given. Calculationsof this sort are extremely rough but-we reckon that with the present supplyof materials and pattern of building programmes, not more than 880,000-920,000can be fully employed. This means, that, even with the present material supplies,the industry has at least 65,000 and probably many more who cannot expectfull and efficient employment. But, as we have already pointed out, suppliesof materials for building, in 1948 will not be enough to meet current level ofbuilding and also, satisfy other programmes:   This is the second stage in our*- This corresponds to a total labour force of 1,300,000 the difference being made up chiefly ofself-employers, employers, women, boys of 14-T5 and&apos;men over 64;
argument. On this basis we are convinced that a target of 850,000 operatives(corresponding to a total labour force of about 1,150,000) is the highest whichcan be fully employed in June 1948. This cut from 985,000 to 850,000 is large,but the drop in the amount of work done should be less than this, since thesmaller force should be fully occupied.15. The best way of applying our conclusions to Departmental programmes is through the building labour ceilings. In many respects this is an imperfectmeasure, but it is the only one in general administrative use and accordinglywe make in the following table precise recommendations for Departmentalbuilding labour ceilings in June 1948. But while building work can only bedealt with in terms of &quot; labour ceilings,&quot; we are not content merely to proposeceilings and then leave Departments to work within them. This has been pastpractice, but experience has shown that nearly every Department has spread itslabour over too many works. It is absolutely essential for this to stop if thereis to be any guarantee that the evils flourishing in the past will not be repeated.Consequently, we make in the Appendices specific recommendations about largeindividual jobs or separateprogrammes within Departments&apos; ceiling as a pattern,which should be followed by Departments for all work which they sponsor. Theseceilings have a further defect, because they do not distinguish between new workand maintenance; we recommend that this division should be worked out and applied to building ceilings as soon as possible.Building Labour Ceilings	Department	Ceiling June 1947	.     1 Ceilings   ) proposed   1 by Building Committee for. -March 1948	Committee&apos;s proposals for ceiling in June 1948	Recornmen-dation as per cent, of March 1948 ceiling: (5) as % of (4)	(1)	(2)	.

16. We must draw attention to some of the problems set out by our recom-mendation that the volume of work authorised by Departments should be equivalent to the employment of not more than 850,000* operatives. Part, but very little, of the reduction will take place through normal wastage; after allowing for some inevitable intake, e.g., of trainees finishing courses at the buildingtraining centres and men released from the Forces, net natural wastage is unlikely to amount to more than 12,000. The first move towards a fall in thebuilding force will come from the reduction in new works implicit in the new building labour ceilings. (To bring this about, most Departments will have totake much more seriously than hitherto their responsibilities for the work whichthey authorise, assist or sponsor. Several Departments do not at present haveeffective control or even in some instances comprehensive knowledge of the new work sponsored by them. We make recommendations on this point in Part IV,where we refer to administrative machinery.) During the first few months of restrictions on new works there will still be many essential building jobs not fully manned, so that, as existing jobs are finished, labour should go with con-tractors (or can be switched by the Ministry of Labour in other cases) to thesejobs. So long as this process continues it is unlikely that much additional labour will be attracted by the large reservoir of maintenance and small works which now exist as a result of the limitation of such work for so long.17. But there will come a point at which jobs on new building will not be enough to give employment to all the building workers becoming available;pressure for them to go into maintenance and small works will then rise. Apartfrom black-market work (now believed to be of small importance compared withthe total volume of building work) a large volume of maintenance can be doneeither under licence or under the &quot; free &quot;  10 limit, below which a licence neednot be sought; to this must be added the expansion of legitimate work into the&quot; grey&quot; market by exceeding the terms of a properly acquired licence. It isclear that all this could employ a larger labour force in every area than it doesto-day, and that the interests of employers, workers and customers will tend todraw more workers on to it rather than to allow them to leave the industry.Some increase in maintenance may be desirable, so long as it is not excessive,because, it has long been restrained and because each man employed on it needsfewer materials than on new work. The additional labour which could safely be allowed for maintenance depends on the alternative uses to which it couldbe put, and On the supply of materials at the time. This balance can onlybe struck in four or five months time, when it will be much plainer than itis now how far there will be a substantial additional demand for labour on theexport drive. Meanwhile, allocations of materials should be framed so as to fit in with a force of 850,000 operatives which is the highest for which materials are likely to be available in June 1948. For steel, the prospect is so bleak, that the target should be to reduce building steel demands by 30,000 tons a quarter, despiteincreases needed for refineries and power stations. This will mean inspection ofrollers&apos; books so as to eliminate all orders for the less essential work which is beingpostponed. For other materials, proposals will have to be worked out later inthe light of our general recommendations.18. Until the long-term prospect has become clearer, central departments and local authorities should confine their grants of licences for maintenance workto existing levels. Later it will be possible to decide whether it would be possible toallow more labour to go into maintenance by increasing licences for such work. If,on the other hand, it was found that extra materials could not be spared forincreased maintenance work, it would be necessary to tighten up licensing anddistribution controls so that essential works within the labour ceilings still gotfirst call on available materials and none seeped off into inessential work.19. A contraction of the building programme leading to a reduction oflabour in the building industry means a sharp reversal of policy pursued by successive Governments since 1943. Throughout, great emphasis has been madeby each succeeding Government on the need for expanding the building and civil engineering industry and many specific promises have been made that theindustry would be kept active at a high level for a long period. It follows thata decision to reverse this process will have to be carefully explained to theindustry and carried out with vigour and ingenuity.   It is important that the* Corresponding to a total labour force of 1,150,000.
change of policy should be made with the knowledge and understanding of theindustry if workers and employers remaining after the reduction are not to be;demoralised.III.-Plant and MachineryScope and Methods of Control20. Investment in plant and machinery is, with a few exceptic-ns, now free of direct controls and is thus a complete contrast to investment in building where an administrative machine controls each job. For this reason when framingour proposals for plant and machinery, we have had to bear in mind that meansof carrying them, out were less certain and direct.21.   Investment in plant and machinery falls into three main groups: -(i) Investment by industries directly owned by the State.    &apos;(ii) Investment by public utilities and other industries which are closelyinfluenced by the Government and can be controlled by direct instruc-tions or changes in the policy bearing on the demand for equipment,and. \ ^jii .;r \ ).   /. ..%:h y.,.,(iii) Investment by the general run of private industry where investment is controlled entirely by the decisions of private firms.22. In the first two groups it is relatively easy to plan reductions in investment. In the third or private sector there is neither detailed knowledgeof the investment which is going on, nor data on which to judge its adequacy,and short of re-introducing a system of individual licences to acquire plant and machinery there is no possible method of detailed control. We are most reluctant to suggest that licences to acquire should be brought in again on a big scale and think that it would be better to rely for the present on the good sense ofindustry following a lead such as we propose in paragraph 28. But should thisfail, a return to the war-time licences to acquire would have to be seriously considered if we were to avoid waste of the straitened resources available for investment.23. Plant and machinery for private industry may be divided between plantof a specialised character mainly sold to a single consuming industry, such astextile machinery, and general plant, such as. pumps, electric motors, &amp;o, whichmay be sold either as end products or as parts of complete machines. In the caseof the specialised machinery the effect on home industry of imposing a certainexport quota on given production can be readily estimated. The limitation ofhome supplies in this way of specialised machinery will in itself affect the domestic consumption of general use plant, since much of it will be requiredfor incorporation in, or use with, the specialised plant. General purpose plantcannot, however, be treated in so precise a manner. Export quotas have been fixed for certain items of general plant, but it is not safe to make these quotashigh, because diversion to direct export might well hold up the production ofother machinery which requires the exported material as components, with thepossible result of delaying exports of finished products more valuable than theexport of general purpose plant. Beyond the limited degree of control throughexport quotas, the Committee sees no simple and direct method&apos; of controllinginvestment in general plant. The total volume of investment would indeed beaffected by general measures of the kind mentioned in paragraph 8, but such measures could not readily distinguish between desirable and, undesirable invest-ment.      IvXrZ - - Q^n-iiU- Ush -rt.; mti &apos;r-&apos;H24. Specialised types of plant and machinery are ships, vehicles for public services, goods traffic and cars for commercial use. As regardsshipbuilding it is possible to influence the direction and production boththrough the allocations of steel which will control total output and the divi-sion between the home market and foreign buyers through licences which are issued by the Admiralty. Vehicles can be controlled by changes in the exoortquotas and materials allocations.25. We have set in the, forefront investment which will most directly andmost rapidly assist in solving our balance of payments problems; in all other fields we have adopted the attitude that, while really essential investment mustbe protected with the addition of measures preventing less essential schemes..34318 &apos; .....   &quot; &quot; &apos;.   o
from creeping under the priority umbrella-r-we must insist on the maximum amount of &quot; mafee-do; ah4 mend &apos;&apos; at least for the coming year. It is plain to us,however, that these changes Will be quite insufficient by themselves to make up .the very serious deficit in the steel budget which was outlined in paragraph 5,and accordingly we have been compelled to propose reductions in investment in public utilities and in nationalised! or quasiipublic industries. In shipbuildingwe think the reduction should for the time being be small since early returnswill be gained from an addition to the British merchant shipping fleet. Ohroad vehicles we think that some reduction in home supplies can be made.,: 2p. Many of these reductions in investment will incur risks. departments have rightly ppintect put to us, for example, the deficiencies of the railway system,the danglers of staggering the electricity load, the high average age of manybuses, the really urgent requirements of the Post Office and so oh&apos;:&apos; Each individual -dual case is extremely strong, but looking at them together and not piecemeal, weare driven to the cqriclusion that the reductions which we have proposed must bemade and the risks faced. If the reductions are not made by plan they willmake themselves, but in a highly chaptic and damaging way.27. Investment in plant and machinery, shipbuilding and road vehiclescovers so many different products that it is hard to summarise the effects qf our proposals. The individual proposals made in the Appendices deal with many different units locomotives, toiis of shipping, kilowatts&apos;of generating capacity,numbers of cars and so on. But in  he following table we have tried, tq convert allthese- into money in the same way as in the table in paragraph 7. The overallresult is  hat the planned annual irate of investment in plant, machinery and vehicles at the end of 1948 will be  527 million, a reduction of 20 per cent, on the 680 million thought possible for the whole of 1948 in the Economic Survey..Gross Investment in Plant, Machinery and Vehicles in the United Kingdoms1?  million&apos;: Mid-1947 Year 1948 End 1948.Annual rate      Forecast as in        Annual rate(approximate)   Economic Survey      proposed&apos;A, Specific programmes of plant and machinery discussed-h(a) Utilities, coal, steel, &amp;c. 135(b) Private sector ...      ... 65 XB.

We referred in paragraph 22 to the difficulty of influencing demand inthe private sector of investment. We believe, however, that industry wouldrespond to a clear lead given by the Government in preference to the alternative of returning to the war-time system of licences to acquire plant. We have con-sidered whether lists could be drawn up of all industries where investment should or should not be encouraged, but we are satisfied that this would be dangerous.Eyen in the  industries which appear less essential at present, some output isrequired and some of the existing plant may be in a condition in which it has tobe replaced, while) some of the export industries may be relatively well off in new plant and machinery and require little or no re-equipmeht in the near future.Moreover, the experience of priority lists during the war, showed that any listwould be applied to. purposes for which it was not, designed. We recommend,therefore, that the Government issue an appeal,&apos; through the E.B.I. with theco-operation of the T.U.C!, to industry to postpone as far as possible all invest-meht not making a significant contribution to the export drive or to the output* Production in the United Kingdom of capital goods for gross investment at home. Importsof capital goods, which are small, are excluded.
11254of the basic industries; such as agriculture;coal and steel; the test, of such anappeal would be its success in reducing demand below the present supply. Wesuggest that the terms of and machinery for issuing it should be discussed withthe F.B.I. and the T.U.C.ll?^ Administration29. The execution of changes proposed by the Committee, if approvedby Ministers, must, of course; remain with Departments; but the home investmentprbgramihe is so large and ,is affected so, closely by changes,in export, programmes,imports and currency needs, not to mention movements of&quot;workers and changesin supplies jpf materials and productivity at home, that continuous adjustmentand oversight are essential.&apos; Furtner, it Will be hecesskry tB see&apos;that a common policy towards home investment is followed by all the bodies whose&quot;activitiesaffect it, !&apos;&amp;-g-i through import licensing. This was recognised in Item 4 of ourTernis of Reference, Which runs :-. i , v i, 1 h     &apos;&quot; Tb supervise methods of cpiitrdllihg aiid reducing the total programmethrough labour ceilings expenditure limits, material supplies, licences, dr anyother methods which are necessary.&quot; &apos;Accordingly the Committee strongly recommend that either another body beappointed to carry out Item 4 of our Terms of Reference or that the Committeebe instructed to carry on and in due course to prepare,a review pf 1949 investment programmes. ,Departmental control of titiilttihg proposals &apos;30. It is especially important to remedy defects in most departments&apos; meansof supervising, building programmes. Improvement of departmental machinery would be one of the greatest contributions to putting building programmes iii order and matching iftaterials with labour. To some extent shortcomings are checkedby the Regional Building Committees&apos; ditty of granting starting dates for jobsbut this is no use when departments, as has happened oh several occasions, sponsortoo much work. When this happens a Regional Committee, is bound to grantstarting dates for relatively inessential work.   Accordingly it is recommended (1) that Departments be instructed to organise means for co-ordinating theirbuilding programmes properly; :;,(2) that the Headquarters Building Committee,.should supervise this;(3) that Regional b Building ; Committees should . be gi,yen more preciseinstructions on the amount of work to which they should]give startingdates and greater power to question Departments&apos; proposals.Compensation Claims       ,.- ... , 31.

At the end of June 1947, 550,000 operatives were employed on various kinds of housing construction, diyided as follows : -; ; ;   &apos; Thousands \ i.-;.War damage repairs      ... ... ...      ... 106Permanent house huilding ... 5 ... ...      ... 245Temporary house building ... ... ...      ... 12Gonrersion and adaptations ...  &apos; ... ...... 51Repair and maintenance ... ... ...      ... 143IS Tojtal     . 57    ...2., There will be a slqw. run-down in the numbers working on war $amagerepairs and a more rapid one among those qh temporary ^^doubt^llp.^ M^^pp:PJD. i^^j^^^a^^^^ and maintpnance cannot be pxpected tip fall and might increase somewhat for reasons set out in paragraph&apos; 17 of tjip main Report.Therefore, the main burden of a cut must be carried by ne/vy housing work, whichin any case, makes the heaviest demands on materials. &apos;3. For a long period new houses were approved at twice the rate of completion.1 Even in July completions had only reached about 12,500 comparedwith approvals of 17,20(1 The result has been a steady growth in the number ofunfinished houses under construction frpm 134,000 in July 1946 to 210,000 inJanuary 1947 and 249]000 in July 1947. This very large and growing stock ofunfinished houses means that more and more materials are locked up in work inhand, just when it is certain that less will be forthcoming. To bring the housebuilding programme into balance under present conditions requires unpleasantdecisions, but these must be even more drastic in face of the prospective reductionin the supplies of materials.4. The first task is to reduce this immense stock of unfinished houses nownumbering 250,000. The first and simplest step administratively is a sharpreduction in the number of new houses approved. A total stop on approvals is notpossible since room must be allowed for7 early expansion of housing programmes in rural and mining areas and for a small number of exceptional cases elsewhere.It is recommended, therefore, that the&quot;rate&apos;of starting and approving new houses should be reduced to 5,000 a month, until the stock of unfinished houses has beenreduced to a manageable size.5, The next step would be to see how many of the further 110,000 houses for which contracts have been let, but where no work has been done, could be stopped. 45,000 of these houses form part of contracts where no work has been started at all on any house in the contract; the remaining 65,000are in &quot; running &quot; contracts where some houses have been started but someremain unstarted in the organised flow of work on properly administered cp -tracts. How many of these should be cancelled cannot be estimated now; somewould be in mining and agricultural areas, others would form part of contractsrunning for a long time where it might be presumed that all the necessarymaterials had been assembled. But even allowing for these, there should be-a substantial number which could be cancelled. The main administrative problems involved would be finding out which contracts had not, gone very far, whichcontracts had materials already on the site, and handling the inevitable claims for compensation. In the first kind of case claims would not be large, butcancellation of the second kind would involve interference with a builder&apos;s methodof carrying out contracts at his own financial risk, and thus lead to large claims.It would be necessary, therefore, to operate as far as possible on the houses which made up part of contracts where no work had been done at all.6. Owing to the large numbers of houses involved, and difficulties of can-celling all contracts, it is probable that these measures would not be enough insome areas, especially those called on to supply labour for the additional houses to be built for miners and farm workers. In such cases the Committee recom-mends that further work on houses which have not reached the damp course should be postponed.  Out of the 45,000 houses in this stage, some 10,000-15,000
form part of contracts where no house has gone beyond the damp course stage;the latter should clearly be considered first if this measure becomes necessary.7. The ultimate rate of building new houses, once part of the stock has been worked off, cannot be definitely settled now because it must be closely related tothe supplies of materials of which timber is the most critical for house-building.On present information we think that the starting rate for new houses might,at the end of the &quot; reorganisation&quot; period, be raised from 5,000 to about11,000-12,000 a month, or about 130,000-140,000 a year. This would roughly equalthe rate of completion between the beginning of April and the: end of Augustthis year. The main doubt about this rate arises from the difficulties of findingcurrency for timber imports on a scale sufficient, to justify starting 11,000-12,000houses a month; large economies in timber usage by permanent houses have alreadybeen made,; and they cannot be carried much further without calling for much larger supplies of cement and steel.8. The effect of these proposals on accommodation provided could be partlymitigated by some changes in the size and quality of the houses to be built.The report of the Central Housing Advisory Committee (1944), on which present practice is based, indicates that the inadequacies of the former type of housingamounted in most respects to more than mere inconveniences. The increase in size and equipment adds between 33 per cent, and 40 per cent, to the cost ofeach house built by a local authority. While a return from present to pre-warstandards of local authority housing is undesirable for many reasons it shouldbe possible to postpone some of the less immediately necessary amenities suchas the out-building, the second lavatory or part of the, hot water system withoutaltering the main plan of the houses. Yet further savings could be made if agreater proportion of houses could be built so as to be divided for a limited periodinto two flats as is done in the &quot; Duplex &quot; houses now accepted by many localauthorities.APPENDIX 2INDUSTRIAL BUILDING(Board of Trade, Ministry of Supply* and Ministry of Food)New Factories and ExtensionsDepartment	Ceiling June 1947	,&apos;    Employed , June 1947	Ceiling ! /. &apos; .   !

The industrial building programme presents- especial difficulties. the size of the programme itself makes a reduction unavoidable if a general reductionof investment is to be made. Apart from this general consideration, factory building has been more affected by the &apos;1 inflation &apos;&apos; of new work in relation to supplies of materials, because supplies of steel have not only been insufficient,but have also been chaotically distributed. The full extent of this accumulation of half-finished work is not known but in Development Areas (about which mostinformation is available)  77-g million of factories have been authorised since1944, but only  31^ million (40 per cent.) are under construction and  5 million(6-1 per cent.) completed.   This process has continued at a high rate; in the
seven months up to the end. of last July, 132 new factories and extensions with,a total cost of  3-8 million were completed, but the stock of factories startedbut not completed rose from 417 to 586 169 additional factories costing 12 million; in value terms, therefore, about four times as much work was putinto the pipe-line as came out. It is clear that on Development Area factories,to which great importance has been attached, the volume of unfinished work isvery large indeed. These account for half of all new factory building in thecountry: elsewhere less information is available, but the enquiry recently madefor the Committee in the North-West Region by the Board of Trade showed that out:of  17-J million licensed industrial and commercial projects costing 10,000 and upwards, only  6f million (38 per cent.) are more than one-quarteron the way to completion. At this rate two years, and probably longer, must elapse before all the  17 million can be finished and provided that no new work is started in the meantime.2. The decisive factor in factory building is steel. Rapid completion ofexisting factory building programmes would require greatly increased supplies,whereas next year there will be less than there is now for this purpose. Conse-quently, it is plain that the rate of finishing factories can only be hastenedby vigorous concentration of labour and materials on a limited number of thosein hand. Unfortunately this step will not be enough. If the vast stock of startedor authorised but as yet unstarted factories is to be reduced to a reasonablesize, the rate of starting new factories (or extending old ones) must also be severely diminished. The scope for these measures is shown by an analysis of factory building in the North-West Region, where nearly two-thirds of thelicensed work has not got more than 25 per cent, towards completion, and a largefringe of industrial building neither contributes to the immediate export drive,nor to basic improvements in the economy. It must be emphasised that theseharsh proposals will not mean reductions everywhere. Many factories will becompleted much more rapidly, and among these will be some for export firms anda proportion of factories in Development Area, with a corresponding reductionof local unemployment in the latter. The effect of the proposed reauctions on exports could also be mitigated by the transfer either of existing capacity within an industry from home to export trade, or by turning over less essential factoriesbecoming vacant to export production.General conclusions. Mention has already been made of the heavy use of steel in factory building. Demands are such that the reduction in this field must be heavy,particularly when the increased requirements for refineries and generating stations in 1948 are taken into account. Accordingly it is recommended that the target should be to save 3Q,000 tons a quarter, mainly on factories, during periods I and II of 1948.4.   The Committee recommends : (1) For a period of at least six months, no new industrial building orextensions should be started. The only exceptions should be where theexport drive will definitely suffer and where no other accommodation is available. Meanwhile all factory building (including extensions)which has not reached the steel-erection stage should be reviewedas a whole with the object of postponing at least half for the timebeing. Departments should be asked to say which factories they wishto start or to continue in the remainder of 1947 and in 1948.(2) Work should then be concentrated on the remaining factories in orderto speed up building.(3) These arrangements should apply to factories throughout the country.(4) The recommendations in (1) and (2) should, if approved, be supervisedby the successor to this Committee referred to in paragraph 29 of themain report, in order to ensure that the review is conducted on acommon basis and that the present administration is tightened up.Ministry of Supply5.   The Ministry&apos;s building work covers a large direct programme foratomic energy station and defence research and development projects as well as34318 d
private projects sponsored for the engineering, aircraft, iron and steel and non-ferrous metal industries, and ferrous metal industries. The approximate presentdivision of labour between these is:-   i , .Building and C.E. Labour(a) Atomic energy      ...      ... ...      ...        4,000 rising to- 6,000 by june 1948.(b) Research and development        ...      ...      ...        3,000(c) Iron and steel programme    ;    ......      ...      11,000 rising to18,000 by june 1948.(d) Heavy electrical plant manufacture    ...      ...        1,500\e) Private building for engineering and otherindustries .........       ......      15,000(/) Total        ...      ...      ......      ...      ...      34,5006. Generally speaking, the Ministry of Supply&apos;s building projects are more carefully screened than those of almost any other department, industrial or non-industrial. The Committee accordingly agreed that there is less room for reduction in this field than elsewhere. Item (a) cannot be reduced on any view ofthe home investment programme and the reductions must therefore be shared bythe remaining items. Although engineering is one of the keys to the exportdrive, it will benefit as much or more than other industries by concentration ofbuilding on a smaller number of projects of first-rate importance. As regardsdefence research and development projects, the Committee recognises that workof exceptional national importance is involved; but the projects are large, areheavy steel users and often sited in very difficult labour areas. These troublesarise particularly over the immense National Aeronautical Research Establish-ment at Bedford. Accordingly the Committee recommend that this programme should be reviewed as a whole and not piecemeal as appears to have been theusual practice in the past, to see where work can be slowed down or postponed for a period of two years as a real contribution to the general reductions of investment. The Committee recommend that the ceiling for June 1948 be provi-provisionally fixed at 38,000, so as to allow some increase in atomic energy and ironand steel building.Board of Trade7. Out of a total of 63,000 employed In June on Board of Trade factories25,000 were on Development Area factories financed by the Government and38,000 on factories sponsored by the department elsewhere. Control of the formeris in the hands of the Board of Trade, but it is extremely difficult to gain anadequate view of the remainder because the Board of Trade does not keep aclassified central record in London of its factory building. As a special measure,however, the Board of Trade has produced for the Committee the admirablesurvey of all industrial building in the North-West Region to which reference has already been made. In the Board of Trade&apos;s own sphere, it is clear that as top on all factory work less than 25 per cent, complete will present real difficul-ties : out of the  3^ million industrial building less than 25 per cent, complete,dyestuffs and chemicals make up a quarter, rayon a fifth and textiles a tenth.Nevertheless, the Committee consider that in present circumstances a ceiling of57,000 is the maximum which can be allowed. The impact of this reductioncan be reduced by vigorous selection of the projects to be allowed to continuetogether, if necessary, with measures to transfer to export production capacity which becomes free, e,g. through reduction in the supplies of materials.Ministry of Food , ;8. The present ceiling is 15,000, compared with which no less than 19,500were employed in June 1947 and over 21,000 in July. Of the 19,500 about 10,500were engaged on repair and. maintenance and 9,000 on new works. 6,200 fromhoth categories were on larger works costing upwards of  2,000, the remainderbeing on small jobs, from which it will be seen that the average size tends tohe small.    The department is already taking steps to reduce the numbers
employed, a start being made by deferring action on all new projects costing 500 or more. , - ,9. So far as present information goes, it appears that the Ministry ofFood programme includes a number of urgent repair jobs or new works neededsoon as part of the agricultural programme, e.g., grain drying off farms, orfor handling more milk which may require as much as 3,000 building workers.Elsewhere there is room for drastic reductions in the amount of work in hand of under consideration, and the small average size of jobs sponsored by theMinistry make a rapid run-down feasible. Accordingly the1 Committeerecommends a ceiling of lljOOO for June 1948 and 8,000 by the end of the year.All new works other than those heeded In connection with the agricultural pro-gramme should be stopped unless essential maintenance or safety is involved.APPENDIX 3AGRICULTUREAgriculture England and wales scotland    &apos; &apos;CeilingJune 194716,0003,000EmployedJune 194712,7971,987CeilingOriginallyProposed for march 194816,0003,000I.P.C. present proposal forCeiling inJune 194823,0004,000Requirements of the Agricultural Programme :- 1.. In this case the Committee&apos;s main aim has been to see how much building is required by the new agricultural programme and to assign the maximum possible amount of labour for this task. Tn view of the competing demands oflabour for farm workers&apos; houses, this amount may not for some time be quite asmuch as the agricultural Departments would like.2. It has been estimated that building work at the rate of  25/35 million a year for five years would be needed to maintain agriculture at its war-time leveland improve standards, e.g., by expanding ley farming, making milk productioncleaner and overtaking arrears of maintenance. Some of this work is notabsolutely essential in present circumstance^ and the Ministry of Agriculturecalculate that agricultural building in England and Wales should amount to 15 million a year, requiring 25,000 building and civil engineering workers; afurther 4,000 should be added for Scotland.3. It is more than ordinarily difficult to find out what the 750,000 farmers and land-owners are in fact prepared to do. Moreover, as many of the buildingjobs are small, it is hard to ensure that they get their proper share of labour and materials. These difficulties will grow as the, rural housing contracts expand and special steps must be taken in order to overcome them. Failure.will jeopardiseessential building on farms. ,    ,4. The first and most important means of doing this would be bettercontact between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Regional Building Com-mittees, on which it is not at present represented, in order to ensure that farmbuilding work received proper attention in the day to day adjustment of building work in each Region. Suitable liaison already exists in Scotland, but in Englandand Wales Ministry of Agriculture officials should be appointed to each RegionalBuilding Committee.        &apos; &quot; &quot; i5. It is equally important to find out, in advance roUghly how much farmbuilding work is required in each locality. The Agricultural Departments have undertaken to ask the County Agricultural Executive Committees to make thenecessary enquiries through their District Committees. The latter coversufficiently small numbers of farms for a useful if rough picture of requirements to emerge. ,*
conclusions. The Committee is satisfied that ultimately ceilings of 25,000 for Englandand Wales and 4,000 for Scotland, would be justified. The main task is theadministrative. one of: collecting and sifting requirements in each locality andof seeing that they are presented properly at the Regional Building Committees.The present arrangements are inadequate and accordingly the Committee recom-mends that the agricultural Departments be instructed to carry through at once the arrangements described in paragraphs 4 and 5. Meanwhile ceilings of 23,000for England and Wales and 4,000? for Scotland are recommended as the maximalikely to be realised during 1948. The volume of work implied by these ceilingsmay demand more steel, especially for Dutch barns, than &quot;will be available,and it may therefore be necessary to examine and perhaps revise programmesaccordingly.APPENDIX 4CIVIL AVIATIONCeiling I.P.C. PresentCeiling Employed Originally Proposals on june 1947 June 1947 &quot;&quot;&apos;    Proposed for Ceilings for march  1948 June 19483,000 2,480 3,000 1,7001. The Ministry of Civil Aviation has at present a programme which wouldemploy 4,165 in June 1948 of whom 735 would be employed on maintenance and minor services, and 3,430 on the major new works and services. Of the lattermuch the most important would be 2.000 men for the London airport and 850 forthe maintenance bases. The Ministry estimate that the expansion of traffic willrequire a further 3 runways by 1951 to complete the double runway system. Therecent expansion of traffic has been very rapid and has doubled during the lastyear. Of the 2,000 men required at the London Airport, 1,500 would be required on runways (using approximately 2,000 tons of cement a week) and 500 on buildings. As regards the maintenance bases, the primary need is stated to befor a base in place of the present maintenance base for the large transatlanticaircraft at Dorval near Montreal, which is a heavy dollar drain. The original programme can be summarised as follows :: Maintenance and main Terminals Main Services    Minor ServicesLondon Airport        ... *   ... &apos;    .... 2,000 50Northolt (second London Terminal) ... 100 30Prestwick       ...      ...      ... 150 50Southampton Water ...      ...      ... 50 15Maintenance Bases    ...      ...      ... 850 150Bad Weather Alternates     ...      ,.. 30 10Training Base ...      ...      ...      ... ... ^0Improvements required for air safetyreasons     ...      ....      ...      ... 250 50Maintenance of other aerodromes  ... ... 350Total    ...      ... 3,430 7354,165i&apos; : ih view of the shortage of materials the Ministry is prepared to reduce its programmes and continue with the existing ceiling of 3,000. Of this 2,00u would still be required in the London&apos;area. In the light of this, the main arguments onthe Ministry&apos;s programme for 1948 turned on development of the London airport.The Committee considers it very doubtful whether, in the current critical european economic position, the volume of air traffic would, in fact, continue to expand asthe Ministry expected. It is also doubtful whether the Ministry should m presentcircumstances plan to receive all traffic offering, and should not instead considerrationing services to the facilities available. The work at the London airport,although comparatively small compared with the nation&apos;s total building resources,
has caused and will continue to cause acute difficulties on the western side ofLondon where the building programme is in a particularly difficult position.Conclusion     -.,,;.).;,,.. , , , (3. The Committee has concluded that work on, the 3 runways at present under construction at London Airport should be slowed down. A ceiling of 1,700is accordingly recommended, at least for 1948, divided between maintenance, new works at London Airport and the principal maintenance bases; other works should cease except for small works needed for safety reasons.APPENDIX 5EDUCATIONEducation England and wales scotland......CeilingJune 194730,0004,000EmployedJune 194714,3381,733CeilingOriginallyProposed for march 194830.0004,000I.P.C.&apos;s present proposals forCeiling atJune 194820,0003,400To simplify this Eeport, the Ministry of Education^ programme is aloneset out. The programme of the Scottish Education Department, which has alsobeen examined by the Committee, is on similar lines.The Educational Building programme . The programme put forward by the Ministry of Education and the pur-poses for which it is required shown below, together with the expenditure needed to keep pace with the requirements of the programme : Requirement(1) To meet places required for raising the school-leaving age to 15 ...(2)-.

It will be observed that this programme is designed to meet minimumneeds and does not provide for building needed to raise the school-leaving age to 18; to make attendance of 15&apos;s to 18&apos;s at County Colleges compulsory; to expand the two-years teachers^ training course to three years; to reduce the 1,000classes which still have over 50 children in them; or to build separate secondary schools for children over 10 (instead of keeping them in &quot; all-age &quot;schools from5 to 15) where these do not now exist. The last two postponements will certainlyaffect the quality of current education in the areas concerned.3. Buildings for raising the school-leaving age, for meeting the require-ments of new housing estates and for talking account of the rise in the birth rate,all arise from the Ministry&apos;s statutory obligations; the first two items account for three-quarters of projected expenditure in 1947 and over one-half in 1948.4. To carry out the Ministry&apos;s programme a ceiling of 20,000 in June 1948rising to 30,000 by the end of 1948, would be needed. The ceiling of 20,000represents an increase of about 40 per cent, above present activity, and 30,000would more than double it. In the Ministry of Educations view adherence tothe lower ceiling would mean a cessation of all,buildings for technical education,delay in finishing school meals building, stopping war damage work equivalentto 55,000 places, postponement of the teacher training programme and a shortageat the end of 1948 of 66,000 places in schools on new housing estates.
5. The Committee recognise that rather unusual risks attend a serious shortage of school buildings. To take a simple example, if a road surface is rundown too far and collapses, it can be repaired at leisure later on without unduedamage having been done; but a child who misses proper teaching through lackof buildings does not really catch up later on as was demonstrated during thewar. Nevertheless, the Committee is convinced that the risks must be faced fora period&quot; and that the results of fixing a ceiling at 20,000 described in para-graph 4 can be greatly mitigated by further use (by requisitioning if necessary)of existing premises particularly for school meals, by resuming the use of oldschools which went out of use during the decline in the school population in the1930&apos;s, possibly by double shift classes for a time and by postponement of theschool meals programme. These alternatives have not yet been sufficientlyexplored by the Ministry.conclusion. The ceiling of 20,000 proposed by the Committee represents an increaseof nearly one-half on the numbers at present employed on projects sponsored bythe Ministry of Education and, against the general background of this report,the Committee recommends that the ceiling should be fixed at 20,000 with no further increase during 1948. The ceiling for the Scottish Education Department shouldbe 3,400.APPENDIX 6FUEL AND POWER			Ceiling	I.P.C.&apos;s	&apos;:       &apos; Ceiling	Employment	Originally	Proposals for	June 1947	, June 1947	Proposed for	Ceiling in			March i948	June 1948Coal ...      ...      ...	3,000	2,635	4,548	4,200Electricity  ...	12,000	9,492	18,500	14,000Gas   ...	4,000	3,531	3,400	4;oooPetroleum   ...	3,000	4,829	4,285	4,800Opencast    ...      ;..	9,000	9,309	11,300	11,3001. The scale of building for the first four programmes depends largely on the pace set by the requirements for plant and output discussed in Appendix 14.With so large a programme, particularly for electricity, it is more than usuallynecessary to match the provision of buildings with the expected arrival of plant.Coal2. A ceiling of 4,200 is considered sufficient for the National Coal Board&apos;srequirement when account has been taken of the Board&apos;s own building staffs.The Miners&apos; Welfare Commission which is a separate body has, however, a programme for 1948 of  2 million for pithead baths,  0-5 million for rehabilitation-tation centres and about  0-2 million for ordinary repairs and renewals, calling for about 2,500-3,000 building workers. These demands will clash with thedemand for labour on miners&apos; houses, which will in any case be difficult tomeet. While, therefore the Committee is prepared to endorse the Miners&apos;Welfare Commission^ programme, it is not prepared at this stage to recom-mend ah increase in the ceiling required, because this would cause preciselythat inflation of building requirements discussed elsewhere in the report. Instead,the Committee recommends that the Ministry of Fuel and Power and Ministryof Works should examine the demands of the National Coal Board, WelfareCommission and Local Authorities in mining areas in order to frame practicalproposals.Electricity3. The Ministry of Works has been giving special support to the central electricity Board&apos;s building programme : it is considered that the ceiling recom-mended for June 1948 is the maximum attainable.-A joint enquiry is now beingmade by the Ministry of Supply and Works so as to match supplies of machinerywith building progress. The Committee has agreed to defer action until theresults of this report are available. The reduction in the Central electricity board&apos;s programme for 1950 proposed by the Committee will mean some reduction
in new building to be started in 1948: The Committee has examined the building programme of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board and provisionallyagrees with the scale of work in 1948.Opencast     ^ ^ - . 15. The increase in the labour ceiling for opencast coalmining is commen-commensurate with the production targets and for that reason should be maintained.Petroleum6. Details of the petroleum refinery programme are set out in Appendix 15.In this case, also, the Committee thinks it would be premature to make recom-mendations and is content to await the report on special measures requiredto push the programme through.conclusion. The enquiries mentioned above should be pressed ahead. Meanwhile theceilings provisionally recommended are : coal, 4,200; electricity, 14,000; gas, 4,000;open-cast coal, 11,300; and petroleum, 4,800. These figures are the highest likelyto be able to be employed on current jobs unless special measures are recommendedby the various enquiries.APPENDIX 7HEALTH SERVICESHealth Services (excludingHousing) England and Wales     ...Scotland ...      ...      ...CeilingJune 194721,0006,000EmployedJune 194716,6822,101CeilingOriginallyProposed for march 194821,0003,000I.P.C. present proposals forCeiling atJune 194821,0003,000Effects of the Committee&apos;s Proposals    ,1.   Two main groups of services are included under these headings :-(1) Hospitals and health services generally.(2) Water supply and sewerage.2. Owing to the pressing demands for water supply and sewerage services,work on hospitals is largely confined to small extensions and alterations. several large-scale water and sewerage projects can no longer be safely postponed andif these are started a small amount of work on the hospital side, e.g., the replacingof some of the many hospitals in large towns destroyed by air attack, will bepossible only if the labour force is allowed to rise to the ceiling ruling in June1947. Even this will allow little room for rural water and sewerage schemes towhich the Ministry of Agriculture attach importance.Conclusion3. The Committee agrees that some increase on the numbers now employedshould be allowed mainly on the grounds that really urgent water and sewerageprojects should not be postponed any longer and recommends that the levelof activity in England and Wales should be allowed to rise to the currentceiling of 21,000. A corresponding increase for Scotland would be to 3,000. TheCommittee accordingly recommend ceilings of 21,000 and 3,000.

The Home Office&apos;s shelter demolition programme is confined to recoveringsteel from surface shelters and a small amount of work on shelters which have become dangerous or would provide useful hard-core building material. 500,000tons of steel remain to be recovered, in addition to the 450,000 tons already got.The provision of 1,500 men for this work should depend on the speed with whichthis steel can be recovered. If a large part of the 500,000 tons could be providedfor the steel industry in the next year, it would clearly be worth while allocatingextra men to this work.conclusions. The Committee recommends a ceiling of 2,500. No new work for the fire services or approved schools should be undertaken and urgent needs for newapproved schools should be met by taking over more existing premises. It isalso recommended that the Home Office and the Ministry of Supply should find out at once to how much steel;remaining in shelters could be recovered in 1948.If it is found that special measures will produce this steel quickly, the ceilingshould be increased accordingly,APPENDIX 9POST OFFICECeiling, Ceiling Employed Originally        I.P.C.

In addition to the demands on the general pool of building and civil engineering labour covered by these ceilings, the railways employ 20,000 on building and maintenances and 55,000 on permanent way maintenance. The localauthorities employ a further 80,000 on maintaining roads. The usual practice isto call on outside contractors only for major new works and subst terations.2. A large number of major road works costing over  100,000 each are under construction, waiting to start or. under consideration by the Ministry of Transport.35 of these are Trunk Roads for which the Ministry is wholly responsible and 21are grant-aided Classified Roads. The Ministry has already provisionally decidedto reduce the programme by 80 per cent, as compared with earlier expectations,for much of which neither labour nor materials would have been available.Among the projects which it has provisionally decided to postpone, subject to ministerial approval, are : -Estimated Cost(  million)Ramford By-pass (Lanes).........      ...      0*3Stevenage By-pass (Herts)............      1-6      (Provided the New Town isKingston By-pass (Surrey) ...Cardiff-Pyle road widening ...Newport By-pass (Mon)     ...      ...Egremont-Aspatria (Cumb) ...      ...Lesmahagow-Canderdyke (Lanark)Butser Hill-Gravel Hill (Hants)   ...Severn Bridge         ...Dartford-Purfleet Tunnel   ...Notting Hill Gate (widening)Elephant and Castle (reconstruction)South Bank, Waterloo Bridge approachNortham Bridge      .........1-01-51-80-50-30-49-06-01-33-61-20-6postponed see App. 13)reductions both in the current building, programme and in the amount of new work which can be undertaken. Expenditure on building in 1937-38, at current,prices, was at the rate of about  5 million a year, though some war preparationwork was included,; compared with this,- the rate in 1948 on the ceiling of 4,000proposed by the Committee would be about  1^ million, or only about 25 per cent,of the pre-war rate. The Post Office would concentrate as much as possible on anumber of new telephone exchange buildings to replace exceptionally old buildingswhere the development of equipment has far outgrown the buildings. about two-thirds of the labour now employed is for local extensions and a furtherone-third on the long distance duct work which must continue if a coherenttelephone system is to be maintained. Accordingly the reduction would be madeon the local duct work, and slowing down the rate of installing telephones for-4 years. New installation would be mainly confined to businesses with exporttrade, farmers and essential classes such as doctors; the present waiting list of400,000 would continue. The Post Office emphasise that the effects of this slowing down would be felt for a good while after the lower reduced ceilings were raised,owing to the arrears of duct work which would pile up.2. The Posh Office also sponsors B.B.C. building projects about which,however, it has little information, except that a large programme is in hand.In present circumstances it is clear that the Post Office, like any other sponsoringdepartment, must be given full information about the quantity and quality of.B.C. building projects.conclusions. The Committee recommends a ceiling of 4,000 and that the Post Officeget full information about B.B.C. building proposals.
The Committee fully agrees with the proposals of the Ministry of Transport aboutlarge works of the kind indicated above-the list is not exhaustive-but is satisfied that postponements could be carried further. Apart from a few excep-tional cases where, for example, a key bridge is about to collapse, or very heavytraffic runs on an exceptionally bad or awkward road, the dangers of postponementcan easily be exaggerated and can be overcome later when materials are morefreely available. Some of the works which the Ministry propose to allow to go ahead are shown below : CostProject       &apos;&apos;&apos; ( million.)

The Ministry of Transport wishes to raise maintenance above currentlevels. Before the war, expenditure was at the rate of  42 million a year, thepresent rate being  55 million, which represents only about three-quarters of thepre-war volume. It is held that war-time arrears should be caught up if heavyexpense and increased quantities of materials are not to be required later. even where the roads look in good condition, the &quot;crust&quot; has worn thin and will-inmany instances wear through before long. The Committee felt unable to accept these arguments. There will be exceptions where major roads with heavy traffic shouldbe kept up properly, but everywhere else there are strong reasons for running downroad maintenance further. It would release substantial quantities of materials, quickly, while the local authorities highway staffs of 80,000 men are a main source of labour for farms and rural housing. Apart from this, the state of roads is onthe average high in this country and clearly offers opportunities for quick and rapid savings in investment. The wear on vehicles will be harder, but as the busesand lorries are exactly similar to types exported for use on worse roads, this argument cannot carry much weight.Conclusion on Road Works4. The Committee recommend that further reductions of new works shouldbe made on the lines indicated in paragraph 2; the lists given there are notexhaustive and should be taken as a guide for policy towards all new works.A ceiling of 10,000 is recommended to cover contract works for roads as wellas the railways and ports dealt with below. As regards maintenance, work shouldbe reduced to a volume sufficient to release 20,000 men, i.e., one-quarter, ofhighways authorities&apos; present staffs. As some authorities may be reluctant to do this and will instead concentrate road staffs on unclassified roads for which theyare solely responsible, it is recommended that suitable means should be&apos; foundto bring them into line.
Railways&apos; building and civil engineering work5. The railways have started or have in view 21 projects costing morethan  100,000. Some are essential to main industrial traffic, some are needed to handle heavy increases in passenger traffic in recent years (e.g. in North-EastLondon) where services are already very bad, some have proceeded a long way, butthere remain several which could easily be postponed.

It is recommended that the policy towards new -WOEks for railways should be on the general lines indicated in para-graph 5, and that the railways&apos; direct labour force should be used on them to agreater, extent than hitherto. The Committee is very doubtful whether theIjpnjstry exercises a sufficiently close control over railways&apos; building work, whethernew or fpr maintenance, aftd recommends that this should be remedied. &apos;Ports and Harbours7.

APPENDIX 11MINISTRY OF WORKS(1)&apos;Direct Building Work for His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentCeiling I.P.C. presentCeiling             Employed           Originally Proposals on june 1947           July 1947         Proposed for Ceiling for march 1948 June 194822,000 18,050 22,000 17,000Scope of the Ministry of Works&apos; Direct Building programme . Out of the 18,000 at present employed, about 11,200 are engaged on maintenance and small works under  1,000. The remainder is concentrated on new works, adaptations and extensions.2.   The main items of new works and the labour required in June 1948on present plans are-Agriculture research, arts and science ....      ...... 480Camps and hostels for miners, farm workers, Europeanworkers, &amp;c.   ...      ......      .......      ... 1,700Disabled Persons&apos; Employment Corporation factories... 800Employment exchanges   ......      ...      ...      ... 250Revenue departments buildingsNational Insurance local officesTemporary Government officesPermanent Government officesHouses of ParliamentMinistry of Pensions hospitalsPalaces, parks, (fee. ...      ...State&apos; institutions ...Adaptations ...702,5002,200500400350200601,80011,3103. Several items (e.g. camps and hostels, agricultural buildings) are bound up with major economic policy, and should therefore not be curtailed. any reduction must therefore be made at the expense of some of the larger remainingitems, i.e., the Houses of Parliament, disabled persons&apos; factories, employmentexchanges, Ministry of Pensions hospitals, National Insurance offices and government offices. The Ministry of Labour is ready to stop plans for Employ-ment Exchanges but wishes the Disabled; Persons factories to continue, thoughthe programme might be reduced by transferring building training centres as they become empty. The Committee is unable to agree to this exception to the virtualban on new factory building proposed in Appendix 2. The training centresshould, therefore, be allocated by Panel B as is usual for surplus government factories. Some national insurance offices will have to be continued as the national insurance scheme is to be introduced on 1st July, 1948, and must have a minimum of buildings available. The Department has informed the Committee that 38of the fairly large number for which existing premises cannot yet be found are regarded &apos; as vital. It is considered that the building labour for these officesshould not exceed 300. As regards the Houses of Parliament, the steelwork isalready up, and there is a strong case for going on so as to provide betteraccommodation for Members and Ministers and foreign press, as well as for reasons of prestige. The Government office building programme is requiredpartly as a result of the great increase in Government activities and partly toenable requisitioning of buildings to come to an end not later than 1952; Further-more, the Ministry of Works have warned us that unless their full programme ofbuilding lessor schemes (referred to in paragraph 8 below) is allowed to proceed,they cannot guarantee to release all the requisitioned premises used as offices by1952 or 1953. It would, no doubt, be desirable that everything possible should bedone within the limits we have laid down to release requisitioned premises assoon as possible and avoid the necessity of extending requisitioning powers, butwe recognise that our recommendations may result in making some extensioninevitable. In order to economise in labour and materials the Ministry of works is concentrating on the erection of temporary buildings. The committee consider that  in order  to  meet minimum  needs the  present  volume  of
work should properly include during 1948 the 2,200 men scheduledfor temporary office building, most of which, will be on the outskirts of citiesbecause these one-story buildings require much land. Continuation of the per-manent building programme, scheduled to have 500 men in 1948, is in the Com-mittee&apos;s view justified, because four-fifths of the work (the Whitehall site) isin the steel-work stage, and because there are very strong reasons on grounds of efficiency for concentrating some departments, e,g., the Board of Trade which isnow spread over 30-40 buildings in London. The programme for 1948 would not include hew Foreign or Colonial Offices, or any permanent office building on theSouth Bank.Conclusion4. The Committee recommend that the Ministry of Works&apos; direct building labour ceiling should stand at 17,000 instead of the present figure of 22,000. Itis recommended that the main cut should be made by slowing down the building of Disabled Persons factories, stopping work on employment exchanges, keeping the building labour force for national insurance offices: at its present level of300 and reducing the average office space occupied by each civil servant belowthe pre-war average for the duration of the emergency.(2) Civil Licence BuildingCeiling I.P.C.&apos;s PresentCeiling             Employed           Originally        Proposals on june 1947          June 1947        Proposed for Ceiling for march 1948 June 194847,056 40,838 50,050 40,000Effect of the Committee&apos;s proposals. The Ministry of Works&apos; civil licence building labour ceiling covers a wide field, part of which represents the Ministry of Works&apos; own responsibilities, i.e.,the building materials industries, building and civil engineering contractingindustries and the Universities (on behalf of the Treasury). The remainder isthe residue not covered by other departments and for which no programme canbe drawn up.6. The scope of this ceiling can most easily be shown by the proposed divisionof ceiling originally proposed for March 1948 : (1) Experimental housing        ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 300(2), Commerce sport, entertainment (offices, banks, theatres,sports grounds, racecourses), including repair work,Olympic games    ...      ... 26,000(3) Universities...........,      ......... 3,000(4) Building Materials industries      ............. 7,000(5) Building  and   civil  engineering  firms,  and  research associations not covered by other departments (mainlymaintenance and V/.D. repair) ....      ...      ... 13,550(6) Miscellaneous (including Churches, clubs) 1,200(7) Total   ...      ...      ...    \....      ....      ...      51,050Conclusions7. The Committee recommend that the building labour ceiling for June 1948should remain at the level of those employed now, viz., 40,000. The saving, ascompared with the original proposals for March 1948 should come partly from thebuilding materials industries, partly frOm a reduction in all office work, togetherwith a stop on all work on theatres, cinemas, sports grounds and racecourses exceptfor safety needs. The reduction in commercial work will affect the buildinglessor &quot; schemes by which private builders put up offices for lease to the Govern-ment; but a slowing down of this programme is inevitable as part of the general reduction in home investment, because Departments cannot expect a large share in such building if private office work is nearly suspended: It will also meandelaying plans for rebuilding city centres destroyed during the war. TheCommittee is prepared to recommend that work for the 1948 Olympic games at a cost of  350,000 should continue, because a good deal of the work has been finished,the Games will earn hard currency and the invitations have gone out.

It has been difficult to gain a comprehensiveviewbf this work, especially in relation to work building undertaken by the ship-building firms&apos; own building maintehahce&apos; staffs. Such information as is available,however, suggests that the yards might well carry out more of their own workand make a correspondingly smaller call on the general pool of building labour.War Office -4. A contract i&amp;boiiiforce ^t about its present level, $ $$oft would limitbuilding almost entirely tb the Minor wprki of lfefes  hah  IGjOOb apiece for whichCommands are responsible. In addition, the War I Office has, is already noted, adirebi building labour force of about 7,000 engaged[oh maintehaiice work. Alarge ^rogiramme of new works has been prepared, the main items being for accommodation; military schools storage and workshops, technical Duiidirigs andhospitals. The Committee considers that the department^ case for new works is less strong than that of the Admiralty which had more key buildingsi destroyed during; the war. Mdrebver, there ii still uncertainty about future larger-scalerequirements (defending bh the size of the United Kihgdoih base).

new aircraft, extend buildings at 4, other airfields, extend further runways forjet fighter aircraft and rehabilitate hutted camps. In present circumstances, theCommittee regard a programme of new works on this scale as excessive, andprobably out of proportion to the most pressing heeds of the Admiralty and WarOffice. Moreover, although the R.A.P. has many war-time jbuildings, it is a muchyounger force with a higher proportion of modern buildings. The. balance, ofwork.between the Services is presumably a matter for the Ministry of Defence, butthe Cdmmittee cannot escape the conclusion that the Air M nist^y&apos;s programme is not altogether in scale with those of the other^ services, which have many veryold buildings and more war damage to repair. Accordingly, the Committee; thinkthat new Air: Ministry works should either be postponed or be met by transferringlabour from maintenance.Housing building work for the Services.7; Some barrack buildings,for, living accommodation, and married quarters,.are. counted as housing. The difficulties of getting houses and increase, in the size of the Services has caused an unprecedented expansion in the demand for married quarters. The problem is rendered more acute by the relatively rapid change inpostings, the lowering of the age at which regular servicemen may marry andtne^vigorousattemjits to raise standards in order to attrkct more riecfuits. It isscarceljf ^uij)fisirig, therefore, that the War Office reckon their present stock ofIlySot) ^^lpl^?:^ti^%rs^&apos;&apos;&apos; nid the Air Minjgtry their stock pf 6,500 as qUit6inadequate.

Actual building is laggingseriously behind these prbgramrnes., 8. A solution to this problem must clearly depend in part oh debisidns aboutthe: future rate of the housing complotion. The&apos;: Service Departments have, how iever, put very strongly to the Committee their View that housing; and married quarters in particular, are highest among their priorities as a major factor in maintaining &quot;general, morale, and in recruiting. What; share of the smallerhousing prbgfaimie they shdiiid enjoy is hot fbr tnd Committee tbkay; But itsuggests that special consideration should be given to this relatively srhallprogramme1, oh a basis&apos; suitable to the fedhced size of the Forces now envisaged,.xt tX conflict of priorities aris^, this programme should be definitely given second place to the special pfbgramnie for building additional houses for miners andfarm workers.Co-ordination of the Services&apos; Building Work9. The Committee has had some difficulty in striking a sound balance between the demands of the Service Departments. In the last,resort, this balanceshould be a matter $6i theMihistfydifDefehce in the liglit of defence needs as awhole. The Services building labour force, if account is taken Of the direct labourfbfces, amounts to no less than 26,000 men quite substantial when compared with several other departments&apos; programmes.Conclusions,10.   The Committee recommends: (1) Building labour ceilings of :-Adrniraliy: 3;70d (direct, 1,700; private, 2,000).War Office : 3,500.Air Ministry: 5,500.(2) The position of the services&apos; requirements for married quarters shouldbe carefully considered, hut in ho circumstances be given preference to miners&apos; and farm workers&apos; houses if a conflict of priorities arises.(3) The Ministry of Defence be instructed to examine the balance betweenrelative demands of the services, rearrange these if necessary, and make proposals for a further overall cut of 15 per cent.
&apos; APPENDIX 13-&apos;:&quot;&apos;:      r ! NEW TOWNS&quot;&apos;.&apos;11\\;--\   v::&apos;:&quot; -J1. The New Towns Programme, so far as building work is concerned, is included in the building labour ceilings of the departments responsible for each service. The Ministry of; TOwn and Country Planning and Department ofHealth for Scotland have general responsibility for the planning and also forthe New Town Corporations. The problem is comparatively simple : these townsare intended, as regards the main &quot;overspill&quot; towns, to take population aswell as industry from large cities, instead of allowing the latter to grow inthe way which has caused general alarm and growing economic loss, e.g., throughthe provision of excessive transport services.2. There are some smaller new towns intended to cater for immediate indus-trial needs or for new mining areas, such as the one at Aycliffe and those inScotland designed to provide for the transfer of the mining population fromthe worked-out Lanarkshire coalfield. These do not present the same problems and we think they should be allowed to proceed;13. The trouble with the &quot;overspill &quot; New Towns is that they require notonly housing, which would otherwise have been in, for example, London&apos;s GreenBelt, but also additional roads, railways, factories, &amp;c, a large part of whichwould not have been required on the fringe of an existing conurbation. Inpresent circumstances it is obviously very difficult to contemplate additionalworks of this sort. On the other hand the New Towns are in such an embryonicstage, lacking even the simplest basic water and sewerage services (except for small numbers, possibly up to about 5,000) that they will always tend to lagbehind London&apos;s housing programme if a complete stop is put to them. Thislag is such that the Ministry of Town and Country Planning has been reluctantlyconstrained to agree to an additional 100.000 people being put in areas originallydesignated as London&apos;s Green Belt.4. Fortunately the dilemma is reduced to manageable proportions by thefact that the London New Town Corporations, in most cases, only want to dosmall sewerage and water work for a period of at least 18 months from thebeginning of 1948. These would employ about 150 men each. Stevenage andHarlow are exceptions because large water and sewerage services are required.conclusions.   The Committee recommends accordingly :-(1) The New Towns basic water and sewerage services should be allowedto go ahead on the basis of two &quot; London &quot; Towns, each employingnot more than 150 men (the maximum figure expected at Crawley-Three Bridges where plans are furthest forward).(2) Large works, such as those envisaged at Stevenage, should be postponedat least until 1949.(3) The New Town Corporations be instructed to use existing housingresources and camps because the temporary houses originally askedfor, are more urgently needed for mining areas. The Corporationsshould also be given second place to the requirements of local farmworkers&apos;housing.(4) The new town at East Kilbride should go ahead because it is mainlyrequired to meet industrial needs.APPENDIX 14PLANT AND MACHINERY FOR PUBLIC UTILITIESRailwaysRolling Stock1. The main items in the railways&apos; capital investment programme are loco-motives, waggons and carriages. It is also convenient to include with theminvestment in track, although not in the machinery category since they consistentirely of steel, timber and iron castings.    The rolling stock programme
together with rough estimates of the value of each section is approximately asfollows :  -1948 Annual AverageLocomotives- 1949-1952; Number   ...      ...      .....,      ...          574 782 million.;:;;      ...      ...      ...      ...           10 13Waggons-- !Number   ...      ......      ......      48,000 62,000  million ...      ...      ...      .......          : 19 25.     Carriages-Number   ...       ...       ...    ;                         3,070 4,070,   . .   million ...    . ...      ..........     .      18 .   .,          24Total:   million  ...     .....     ... 47 62The steel requirements for the 1948 programme are: locomotives, 49,000 tons;waggons, 373,000 tons; carriages, 70,000 tons..,;.-,.&apos;,&apos;2[.., The object of the programme is to provide 600 locomotives a year forrenewals and an additional 180 per year for four years to catch up arrears ofreplacements incurred during the war. The large number of over-age locomotivesis &quot;beginning to cause serious difficulty owing to the increasing number of break-downs; repairing these takes up capacity in the workshops which might beused for making new rolling-stock. On a stock of approximately 20,000 loco-motives, the railways now have about 1,500 at any one time undergoing heavyrepairs, compared with about 700 before the war; the corresponding figures for light repairs are 2,500 and 1,300. Therefore twice as many locomotives areundergoing repair as compared with 1938.3. The provision of waggons is the most important single investmentrequired by the railways to-day. Out of a stock of 1,220,000, 190,000 (15^ per cent.)are awaiting or undergoing repair, an increase of 20,000 on last year. In addition the railways are acutely embarrassed by having 350,000 (29 per cent.) more than35 years old and wanting increasingly frequent repairs. The Ministry ofTransport argue that the only method of breaking this vicious circle would be to concentrate efforts on making 50,000-60,000 new waggons a year by the railways,private manufacturers and R.O.F.&apos;s. It is, however, doubtful whether this can beachieved in 1948, and it is probably more realistic not to count on an expansionabove current levels. ;    ;;; 4. The railways contemplate a large carriage-building programme three times above the current output, the total cost of which would almost equal thatof the waggon programme. There is muph old stock in existence but the case for increasing output on this scale is clearly nothing like so strong as that forwaggons and locomotives. In particular, the rate of replacement proposed bythe railways is much higher than with waggons, where the shortage is greater.The only exception is coaching stock for those extensions of the London railwayswhich have got to an advanced stage of construction, in order to meet housingdevelopments already well in train.Conclusions ;5,   The Committee recommends:-(i) That the steam locomotive programme should be kept to a maximum of.600 per annum for 1948 and 1949.;     (ii) That the waggon programme should not be reduced at this stage, butthat, as the steel demands are so large, there should be no increase in. the programme which should remain at 48,000 for 1948 and 1949.(iii) That the carriage programme should not rise above the present outputof 1,000 carriages a year.  If exports cannot bis increased, production should be reduced correspondingly and resources devoted to other purposes.      . -Permanent Way6. The railway programme for permanent way materials is divided betweenordinary current maintenance (about four-fifths of the total) and recovery of
arrears of past renewals during ti^e war (about one-fifth of the total), On this assumption the requirements of materials per anum are as follows :-Rails      ...      ...............      310,000 tonsSleepers ...      ...............      4-75 million(144,000 standards)Cast-iron chairs ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      204,000 tonsSteel accessories ...      ...      ...      ......       24,000 tops7. The balance of need is particularly difficult to strike in this case : onthe one hand, if cuts in steel supplies are imposed, the Ministry of Transportsay that they would put locomotives and waggons in front of supplies of trackmaterials; on the other hand, it is plain that a reduction in the&apos; latter to the250,000 tons of rails (with accessories to correspond) required for current renewalswould have an adverse effect on the average speed of trains on the railway system.This is&apos;not so much a question of the speed of expresses, which has already been considerably reduced, but of the rest of the system as a whole. The slowertheavefage speed, the longer the track is taken up by each train, and the longerare waggons on their journeys. In short, the demand for waggons and lqco-motive^ would be accentuated. Such factors as these clearly face the railwaysjjrith &apos;$ jpility of&quot; a&apos; severe cri sis and&apos; some experts hold that one was only.^Y$&amp;&amp;.-*%^-W^ffi % W$ jP!^rY?nfton 6f&apos;b^&apos;we&amp;l%er and&quot;the fuel crisis.&apos;How-eypi that Jp$yl^e, jtne \^pjnmittee,&apos;! paying regard to ffie s eel - prospect, thinkthai ?pifte risk must be taken ^ith perrnarient way, pot,&apos; of course,&apos; by renderingtjbayei 1,&apos;ess safe,t ^PP^P^i^yg .l^fP^^&apos;-&apos;l^^$19*I^PI:&apos;..&apos; -conclusion. The Committee recommend that allocations of steel for the permanentway should not exceed 62,500 tons a&apos; quarter for at least six months and thesjeeper supply to 1 million a quarter, but that the figures should be reviewedupwards as $pqn as the situation perniits.ElectricityCentral Electricity Board programme . The programme for generating station plant is still in ja fluid state asregards plant to be installed after the middle of 1049. Until then, the scale ofwork is set by orders placed and buildings started as far back as 1944 or 1945.The plant programme has lagged so that arrears have accumulated, but theMinistry bfSuhply have taken-steps to remedy this; the results have yet to be examined in brddr to see how &quot;far plant likely to arrive earlier than expected canbe&quot; matched by the building programme. &quot;10. The programme originally authorised by the Electricity Commissionenvisaged an expansion of new plant installed from 500 Megawatts (1 MW- ^ 1*Q0 )kilowatts) in 1947-48 to 2,650 MW. in 1951-52. &apos; In the latter and succeedingyears a substantial surplus margin above demand was expected; the Committeethinks that in present circumstances it is unsound to budget for a surplus of thiskind, though it completely accepts the need for installing as much capacity aspossible during the next three years. By 195,0, however,, supply, will be muchnearer estimated demand than it is now. Accordingly, it is recommended thathew installed capacity should be allowed to rise as planned by the Ministry ofSupply to 1,^50 MW. in 1948 to 1,600 MW. in 1949, &quot;but should&apos;thereafter belimited to not inqre than 1,500&quot; MW per year, IfcEe,: rpmajnin^ capacity beingturng^&apos; oyerfe exports. &apos;Th re &quot;are --risks in this coursepbut ltmustbe observedthat qh present &quot;forecasts,&quot; the positionafter the &quot;inclusion of this plant, will be^^^i^m&amp;&quot;^i^^^^D. in&apos; 1946&apos;&quot; or 1947; In the Committee&apos; s yievy the&apos;&apos; decisivefactor is&apos;the, enormous quantity of steel required for the existing C.E.B. pro-gramme-no&apos; less&quot; than &apos;279,&apos;0db tons in 1948 rising to 332;000 tons/in 1949. If tothese are added the corresponding steel requirements for buildihg&quot;(125,000 tonsand 165,000 tons respectively), it is very doubtful indeed if the present programme can be regarded as realistic. The reduction in steel require-ments following the Committee&apos;s proposal will be 27.0.0.0 tons in \L948,from plant being made for installation in 1950, and larger .quantities in later
35years. The original proposals and the Committee&apos;s recommendations are sum-marised in the following table :  .  ,(1) Electricity Commn&apos;s original fore-casts of net new capacity installed(2) Ministry of Supply revised estimateof plant likely to be installed   ...(3)   Committee&apos;s proposals      ...      ...

The Committee recommends (1) that the figures in line 3 of the tableshould be taken as a basis for a revised plan; (2) that the enquiry now in handshould be pushed on to see if this fits the building prospects; (3) that estimates ofsupply be revised accordingly; and (4) the whole question of extending the distri-bution system should be investigated in view of the long period which must elapse before the gap between supply and demand can be filled. JNorth of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board&apos;s Programme12. The Board&apos;s programme in the light of present progress will providethe following capacity for exporting current to the national grid :-Megawatts1949-50.........      ......      ... 1501950-51 .........      .......... 3001951-52 ......      ...      ...      ...... 3901952-53 ......      ............. 4651953-54 ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 495Annual requirements of steel in 1948 and 1949 are about 40,000 tons.13. Most of export of current will be to Central, and Southern Scotlandwhich is at present better supplied with electricity than other parts of the UnitedKingdom; on the other hand, many of the steam generating stations are alreadyover-age and little provision has been made for replacing them in the expectation of receiving current from the Hydro Board.Conclusion14. The Committee recognises that when operating the scheme will makea valuable contribution to the country&apos;s electricity needs without using coal,though unfortunately this will not be large until 1950. The Committee conse-quently recommends that the programmes should proceed, but has asked the Boardand the Scottish Home Department to report on the possibilities of (1)re-arranging programmes, including some of the distribution projects, in order toreduce the demands for steel and cement in 1948; and (2) of giving priority tothose parts of the projects which will produce more current for sale to the C E.B/sgrid in 1949 and 1950.H-fil? Gas     .. &quot;i ;::&apos;vv&quot;&apos;:i ;15. The gas industry&apos;s capital investment programme for plant and machinery and building is shown in the following table :-Industry&apos;s Capital Investment Programme(Plant, Machinery and Building)  million. 1948 19491.

It is not easy to distinguish in some cases between building work and engineeringwork and a clearer picture will be gained by setting out the two programmestogether.16. About 90 per cent, of the work consisted of the replacement of existingcapacity the remainder being for new work. The latter might extend at alater date if the industry were nationalised owing to the development of gasgrids, &amp;c. Before the war the industry was in a comfortable position and possessedspare capacity to meet exceptional demands in heavy weather and to allow theregular overhaul of plant. During the war plant was run down severely and in place of the pre-war usage of 180,000 tons of steel a year allocations run at theaverage rate of 50,000 tons a year. As a result plant is now in a bad condition and requires constant repairs. In the current quarter supplies of steel had been allocated at the rate of 120,000 tons a year. Reductions on this level will in theview of the Ministry of Fuel and Power fall entirely on new work required toreplace obsolescent plant.Conclusion17. The Committee recognise that there are serious dangers in holding offarrears of maintenance much longer but are of the opinion that this is one morerisk which must be run. They accordingly recommend a reduction of investment in the industry (including repair and maintenance) to correspond to a steel alloca-tion of 100,000 tons a year.Post Office18. The main requirements of the Post Office for plant and machinery arein respect of telephone and telegraph equipment. The capacity of the industryis estimated at about  13 million in 1948 though output will &quot;only reach about 10 million owing to the fuel crisis and reconversion difficulties. Capacity isexpected to rise to  18 million in 1948 and  22 million in 1949. The Post Officehope to take about  5 million of the product in 1947 (50 per cent, of output) and 6 million in 1948 (33 per cent.) and propose to keep down their demands at this level (i.e.t at 27 per cent, of output) for two or three years. The amount of steelrequired by these programmes is about 20,000 tons a year.19. The Post Office emphasise that keeping their demands at this level is bound to lower the efficiency of the telephone service as old plant wears out, besideslimiting the number of new subscribers who can be accepted. The present waitinglists contain 400,000 applications, of which about one-third are from businesses.It is anticipated that five years would be needed to catch up the resulting arrears of work.Conclusion20. The Committee think that the reduction in standards must be accepted;as regards 1948 it recommends that the Post Office be insructed to keep itsdemands for plant and equipment to the same level as in 1947, viz.  5 million, inorder to release additional production for export in 1948, provided that the switchcan be made at short notice. Thereafter it is recommended that the Post office programme be allowed to rise to  6 million for each year until 1950 as proposed bythe department.21. A detailed review is now being made by the Ministry of Civil Aviation,the Air Transport Corporations and the Ministry of Supply into the aircraft and ground equipment programmes for civil aviation, and in these circumstances theCommittee put off examination of them until the results are available.APPENDIX 15PLANT AND MACHINERY INVESTMENT BY NATIONALISED,SEMI-PUBLIC AND SIMILAR industries. Industries included in this group are coal, iron and steel, petroleum and agriculture. Although the last three are in private ownership, the scale of investment may be said to be broadly influenced by the Government.
Coal2. The National Coal board&apos;s long-term investment programmes will notbe worked out in terms of raw material requirements until towards the end of1947. Preliminary estimates are shown in the following table. These includemajor replacements, the short-term mechanisation programme, medium and long-term development work: 1948  million1949 1950(1) Coal face plant (including electricity equipment)(2) Tubs, cars, locos., haulages   .........(3) Shaft equipment (including electricity equipment)(4) Winders, ventilation, headgears      ......(5) Generating plant, Washeries, &amp;c.......(6) Total ...      ... ............10&apos;2-2-8-7&apos;31-910-53-04-111-88-337-410-53-04-114-08-539-8195110-53 04-114-08-539-83. These estimates, which for 1948 will be at about twice the level of investment in 1947, are still at too early a stage for the Committee to reach conclusions about them. The general conclusion is, of course, that investment which will increase coal output must be stimulated to the full. But it is also necessary to ensure that plans do not outrun capacity and absorb materials inunfinished production, as nas happened elsewhere even with programmes of first-rate importance.Conclusion4. It is recommended that the final programme should be submitted to theCommittee or its successor for further examination as soon as it is completed.Iron and Steel5. The Iron and Steel Industry&apos;s programme for new equipment and majormaintenance as drawn up in 1946, provided for the peak of expenditure on plant and machinery to be reached in 1948 and 1949, thus :   million1947 programme       ...      ...      ...      ...      19-91948 programme1949 programme1950 programme1951 programme37 138-523016-5The ultimate cost of many of the schemes now in train may be about 40 per cent,greater that at fifst estimated. Delays both at the outset of the programme andsubsequently have somewhat altered the pattern of expendiure, pushing the peakinto 1950. No precise figures can be given because the original estimates havenot been brought up to date, but as it is still the industry&apos;s aim to complete thewhole programme by 1951, expenditure for the next two years is likely to beabove rather than below the original estimates.conclusion. The re-equipment of the iron and steel industry so as to raise annual output to 15 million tons of crude steel in 1951 is vital to recovery. The Com-mittee therefore proposes no cut, but as the industry&apos;s programme was drawn upin 1946 it should be reviewed in the light of the present situation to see that itis still practicable and realistic. In order to ensure that the programme fits in with the timing of other demands on resources, no new major development shouldbe initiated until the review which we propose has been considered by thisCommittee or its successor.PetroleumUnited Kingdom Refinery programme. A very large programme for establishing oil refineries in this country has been prepared by the Ministry of Fuel and Power and the oil companies.[34318] g 2
The primary aim is to save large amounts of dollar exchange by refining crude oil in this country instead of importing the refined products mainly from dollar sources. A subsidiary gain will be the establishment of a petroleum chemical industry in this country.8.   The total cost of the programme will be about  95 million (includingabout  60 million on plant of all kinds) for capacity capable of handling n20 million tons of oil a year.   The most tangible measure of the impact of this &quot;programme on manufacturing industry is the steel requirements, most of whichmust be met by the United Kingdom.   The stated requirements are: &apos;000 tons19481949195019511952Total (five years)       ...      ...      ... 387It is however doubtful whether the programme could be put in hand so rapidly as to require the amounts shown for the earlier years.9. The value of the dollar savings partly turns on the speed with whichthe refineries can be built. They are large projects, calling at the peak in 1950for a building and civil engineering force of 11,100 and plant erection forceof 8,000, all of which must be found and housed. In addition the manufactureof the necessary plant impinges on the production of boilers, the supply of whichis one of the chief anxieties in the generating stations programme.Conclusion10. The Committee recommends that the programme be approved inprinciple; but before it is finally accepted regards it as essential to have a realisticbuilding and plant production programme worked out to meet the difficultiesalready mentioned. Special action will be required to make sure that building and plant are matched throughout and that the programme is carried out onschedule. Unless this is done there will be a real danger of the programmemaking exceptionally heavy demands on scarce resources without the large earlyresults which are one of its main justifications. The Committee therefore recom-mends that Ministries of Supply and Works should be asked to join with theMinistry of Fuel and Power in working out a realistic programme for submission to this Committee or its successor.Overseas Programme11. The main problem in this case is the allocation of steel for developingMiddle Eastern oilfields. A number of major matters of policy have yet to beconsidered by the Official Oil Committee. When this has been done the detailedprogramme should be reviewed by the Committee in the light of the demands made by the programme on national resources.Conclusion12. Meanwhile as this programme uses large quantities of steel ( tonsa quarter) the Committee has recommended a cut of 20,000 tons a quarter.Agricultural Machinery13. The Ministry of Agriculture&apos;s programme for tractors and other, agri-cultural machinery has been drawn up on the basis of demands under the neWagricultural production programme and of the scale of exports which it was11615386266

This programme represents requirements based on planned developmentof capacity and assumes that sufficient steel is made available; hitherto demandshave been met and a larger allocation has been given for Period IV up to75,000 tons in order to allow the big spurt in tractor production now takingplace. Steel allocations will rise from 110,000 to 134,000 tons per quarter in1948, and if these cannot be met the Ministry of Agriculture will recommendthat supplies to the home market should be maintained at the expense of exports.Conclusion15. Further enquiry will be needed to establish finally the balance betweenthe import saving value of home supplies and the value of exports, but there arestrong arguments for believing the balance would be decisively in favour of retaining the machinery for home use. Subject to this, the Committee recommendacceptance of the Ministry&apos;s programme.APPENDIX 16PLANT AND MACHINERY FOR PRIVATE industry. The Committee has examined home demand, prospective production andthe new export quotas for specialised plant and machinery. In some cases therecent increases in export quotas leave the home investment at about the rightlevel. Elsewhere, however, the Committee has felt that supplies for the home market would still be greater than could be justified in present circumstances,and has consequently proposed either further increases in the export quotas orconsidered desirable to indicate to the Committee of European -Economic Co-operation in Paris.  It is as follows :-  millionHome
a reduction of total production where the export demand is inelastic, so as to release resources capable of being diverted to other forms of production.2. The result of the further proposals made by the Committee is shown inoutline in the following table : Specialised Plant  millionCurrent A annual   A annual RateRate end 1948(1) Total production     ...      .........      110 121(2) Exports...............        45 72(3) Production for home market (1 - 2)...      ...        65 49(4) Imports ...      .........      ...      ...         2 1(5) Gross supplies for home market (3 + 4)               67 50The effect of these changes will, it is estimated, transfer 60,000 tons of steela year for making equipment for home use to exports.3. Much work has yet to be done in working out the implications of theproduction departments&apos; original proposals for the level of production and exportsat the end of 1948, and also on the modifications suggested by the Committee tothe Departments concerned, but it is believed that this outline represents a genuinepossibility always given that the necessary steel supplies for the engineering industries are forthcoming. The net result for home investment will be a reduc-tion from the annual rate of  67 million to  50 million a year. Taking this field as a whole, a reduction in home investment in plant and machinery willhave an appreciable and quickly-felt effect either indirectly through the releaseof materials for export purposes or directly by increasing exports. This hasbeen the primary factor influencing the Committee, but it has recognised thatit would be folly to ignore the need for a substantial measure of re-equipment insome industries and particularly basic industries which did not benefit by war-time programmes. The exact balance can in some cases only be struck as aresult of experience. It is impossible to cover the whole field in detail within thespan of this Report, but there are certain features which should be mentioned.Ministry of Supply4.   Production of metal working machine tools is expected to increase further-before the end of 1948; present export quotas are at 45-50 per cent, and theproposed target is 50-60 per cent.   The Committee recommend increasing the quota definitely to 60 per cent., because there is a prospect of increasing exportsto hard currency markets, particularly the Argentine, while the reduction in home supplies has been partially cushioned by the large surplus of war-time machine tools.  If circumstances demand, a target of 65 per cent, might be considered for ashort period.   Boot and shoe making machinery will be produced by the end of1948 at the rate of  2 million a year and the Committee consider that a further increase in the export target would not have an adverse effect on home productionand have accordingly invited the Board of Trade to see whether a further increase could be made.   Three further industries making machinery for glass working,electric lamps and valves, and printing machinery are considered by the Committeeto have been treated somewhat lightly in the original allocation of export quotas,and despite difficulties, particularly from short supplies of printing plant to thehome market, it recommends re-examination of the export quotas with a view to increasing them.  Textile machinery presents difficult problems.   It is estimatedthat production will reach an annual rate of  36 million a year by the end of 1948of which exports will take  27 million worth a year on present arrangements.Even after allowing for the increase in production this means a sharp fall in supplies to the home market.   The Board of Trade have examined the positioncarefully but have yet to work out in detail how a reduction is to be distributed.The Committee recommends that this should be done as soon as possible and areport made to this Committee or its successor.   A substantial increase in theproduction of hosiery machinery is proposed by the end of 1948 to about 3^ million a year of which rather more than half will remain at home, mainly for the manufacture of fully-fashioned stockings for the home market.  It will befor Ministers to decide whether this &quot; amenity &quot; demand should still be satisfied.If it is not, it will be a matter for examination whether it will pay us better to export a higher proportion of the machinery (for which there is a large market
in hard-currency areas) or to retain the present quota and export more stockings.As reglpds Wood-tvorking machine tools the Committee recommend that theexport target should be increased from 50 per cent, to 60 per cent, since timber supplies for furniture are unlikely to increase and will probably be reduced.Tobacco and cigarette making machinery is expected to rise to an annual rate of 3^ million by the end of 1948 of which about  2f million will be exported. Thisis an excellent hard currency export and the Committee recommends that nomachinery at all should be allowed to go to the home market, except for basicmaintenance, and that the export quota be increased accordingly.Ministry of Food5. In the Ministry of Food field the most difficult item is dairy machineryof which production at the end of 1948 will be about  3^ million a year. A highexport target taking about 5/6ths of this production has been fixed, but this can only be achieved if the Ministry of Food defer nearly all its clean milkprojects. As milk production increases with the expansion of agriculture underthe new programme increasing amounts will have to be bulked and handled in large quantities which will be safe only if the milk is pasteurised. In suchcases there are strong grounds for agreeing to an increased installation of plant for handling the milk as a derivative of the agricultural programme.There are, however, other cases where milk will not be bulked and in this casethe machinery would merely represent an improvement of existing facilities andwould not form an essential part of means for increasing the bulk supplies of milk to large urban areas. On balance, the Committee feels that the first case should be met, but the second refused, and recommend that the export quota shouldbe reduced from the level proposed by the Ministry of Supply to about  1^ million a year. This should be examined by the Ministries of Food and Supply and areport submitted to the Committee. Grain milling machinery is one of thebest exports from this country; export quotas have already been set at high level and the Committee recommends that these should be maintained. Newinstallations in this country would make heavy demands on steel and building labour. Refrigerating machinery is divided into two sections, commercialrefrigerating machinery of which production would be at the rate of  6 million a year at the end of 1948, and industrial refrigerating plants at about  1^ million a year. Some is essential for the Ministry of Food&apos;s project for quick freezingfish in order to increase supplies, and the Committee consider that increased supplies of industrial refrigerating plant may be required, but that the volumeof home investment in refrigerators for shops, hotels, &amp;c, could safely bereduced. The Committee recommends that the Ministry of Supply and the Boardof Trade should re-examine the export quotas with a view to a very substantial increase.Ministry of Works6. As regards the Ministry of Works1 field no detailed figures coveringcontractors&apos; plant as a whole are available. The future allocation of excavatoroutput is now under examination by the Lord President and the Committee has,therefore, refrained from making recommendations in this case. Road rollersand concrete mixers should both have demand substantially reduced by proposals made in other parts of this Report, and the Committee recommends that anincreased proportion should be allotted for export during 1948. The Committeewas unable to reach any conclusions about supplies of cement-making machinery to the home market. A balance has to be struck between the export of increasedquantities of cement for which further plant will be required in this country, orof meeting the many countries&apos; demands for cement-making machinery. If theUnited Kingdom did not export machinery it is probable that the United states would do so. The Committee recommends that the Board of Trade and theMinistry of Works should be asked to determine where the balance ofadvantage lies.General Purpose Plant7. In addition to the specialised plant there is a. wide and diverse range of plant, machinery and factory equipment which is not identifiable with anyparticular user industry. Much of it is utilised both in the public and private sectors of industry and for non-manufacturing as well as manufacturing purposes.Some, e.g., internal combustion engines and electric motors, are also incorporated
in other machinery in addition to being used as end products in themselves. Forthese reasons very little is known about the scale of essential home requirements,and in many cases there is no statistical information about the volume 01currentsupplies. It follows that the consequences of restricting supplies to the home market are virtually unpredictable.8. The Committee has not been able to examine this field in detail, but clearly its contribution must be looked at closely in view of the large share oftotal output which it represents, ,9. The Export Plan has, of course, already imposed significant restrictionsof supplies to the home market. In some cases, e.g., internal combustion engines,high targets have been set for the direct export of the equipment as such.In other cases the expansion in the export of specialised engineering goods will attract from the home market an increasing quantity of general purpose planteither for use in association with the specialised plant or indirectly asincorporated components of such plant.10. From the demand side the restrictions in the supply of specialisedplant for the home market and the curtailment of factory building proposed else-where in this report will also combine to reduce the demand for general purposemachinery and plant for home use.11. The Committee sees no simple and ready means of screening either thedemand for or the supply of this class of equipment for home use, or of recom-mending quantitative limits for home supplies as these would, in the natureof the case, be little more than arbitrary. Apart from the control of specificinvestment programmes, which will have consequential effects in this field, andfrom a general appeal to industry to refrain from investment which will notquickly ease the balance of payments problem, further restrictions canbe achieved only by forcing up export quotas for particular items or converselyreducing supplies of materials for their manufacture where experience suggeststhat the home market could be squeezed without serious consequences. The Com-mittee is of opinion that there is scope for further measures on these empiricallines. In particular it recommends that home supplies at the end of 1948 of thefollowing products should be reconsidered from this standpoint: industrial hard-ware, gauges and fine measuring tools, wires and cables, batteries, cranes andhoists, factory conveyors, works trucks and trolleys, transformers, furnace plant,packing and labelling machinery, pneumatic portable tools and other power tools,pumps and welding plant.APPENDIX 17SHIPBUILDING1. Shipbuilding is at a high and increasing rate and the capacity of the yards has nearly been reachsd with 1-8 million gross tons under constructionat the end of July. The total value of output and exports is roughly as follows :   million total          For United Fordeliveries   Kingdom owners export1947      ...      ...      ...      63                  48 151948      .........      74                  50 24The 1947 production will be below capacity mainly owing to the fuel crisis andreconversion delays. Requirements for steel for the 1948 programme would beabout 235,000 tons a quarter compared with a current allocation of 190,000,though this has in practice been considerably exceeded by deliveries.2. The broad object set by the Ministry of Transport for shipbuilding isto restore the British merchant shipping fleet from its present level of 14^ million gross tons to its pre-war level of 16i million gross tons. This will provide sufficient shipping for the United Kingdom&apos;s own trade, and replace UnitedStates vessels which are not only very expensive to charter, but also requiredollars.  A fleet of this size will also enable British shipowners to retain a larger
share of the liner freight traffic where competition, especially from United States,companies, is intense. The programme will also, permit some replacement of over-age vessels or wartime vessels built of inferior materials, which have combinedto raise the proportion of, the fleet laid up for repairs to 112  per cent.(i.e., 1 - 8 million gross tons) compared with 8 per cent, in 1939 (i.e., 1-3 million,gross tons).3. The proportion of ships destined for export is about 33 per cent, of thetotal; of this about.35 per cent, or 10 per cent, of total output is for hard currencycountries. The main issue before the. Committee was whether it is better to buildships for immediate sale abroad or to operate them under British flag. Thisbalance has been carefully examined and the conclusions reached are :-(1) It is advantageous to retain the ships in British ownership rather than to export them immediately, because the high freight rates now rulingmean that the vessels rapidly saved, or quickly earned, dollars, whereas,sales are mainly to soft currency countries.(2) On balance it is better to retain the steel, if total steel supplies allow,for shipbuilding for British operations, rather than to reduce the size of the industry and divert the steel to general engineering.If the programme were reduced by 10 per cent, and the cut fell on ships forBritish flag, it would lead to an additional dollar cost in chartering of about 10 million in the next five years. On the other hand, the outright loss in sales to foreigners, if the reduction fell on ships for sale abroad, would be about 7 million, most of which would probably be in soft currency. As to the secondconclusion it should be pointed out that the diversion of further steel toengineering exports would in all probability also only produce an expansion in-soft currency sales.Conclusion4.   The Committee recommends : -(1) The 1948 programme should be reduced so as to allow a reduction in steelrequirements of 15,000 tons a quarter.(2) Since freight rates and other considerations may change fairly quickly,.and since ships laid down in 1949 will not earn until 1951, the position.for that year should be reviewed in April 1948.APPENDIX 18ROAD VEHICLESGoods Vehicles for Road Haulage1. The fleet of goods vehicles fell from 504,000 in 1938 to 450,000 in 1945.Since then the fleet has grown again due to the intake of new vehicles, surplusservice stocks and vehicles taken out of storage and numbered 616,000 in May 1947 an increase of one-third over 1945 and one-fifth over 1938. The post-warexpansion has been mainly in vehicles with &quot; C &quot; licences. During the coming winter the larger vehicles will have to carry a heavy load to relieve the railways,but the new Transport Commission should be able to rationalise services, scrapolder vehicles and thus reduce the average age of the fleet.2. As a goods vehicle is much the same whether sold at home or abroad, we^jink that, in this instance, export should be pushed well past the limit of home market convenience, since supplies of vehicles can readily be switched back ifthere were not enough for the home market or if exports declined.Conclusion*3. It is recommended that not more than 50,000 new vehicles should be-released for the home market in 1948, and that the supply of light vans for less important distribution purposes should be most severely curtailed. Early action,should also be taken by the Transport Commission to rationalise its services.[34318] H
public Service Passenger Vehicles4. The fleet of passenger vehicles reached a total of 59,700 at 1st September,1947, compared with about 50,000 before the war. Expansion has, therefore,taken place notwithstanding the fact that more than half the present fleet is overten years old and due for replacement by pre-war standards. About a quartex-of the present fleet is, in fact, over 14 years old. 1,; 5. It has been urged that further expansion of the fleet is needed to improveminers-services and to carry increased traffic resulting from double day shiftwork and the abolition of the basic petrol ration. It may well be that services insome areas must be developed if the necessary labour is to be attracted intomining and agriculture, but in general this is not the time to expect even. tomaintain the present level of amenities in public transport, either for passengers-or for the workers in the transport industry.conclusion. We recommend an intake of 4,000 vehicles in 1948, and suggest that thepossibility of transferring coaches now used for long distance journeys shouldhe explored if the recommended intake of new vehicles should threaten localpassenger services. Such schemes as that of the London Passenger transport board for converting from trams in South London should be postponed for atleast two years.&apos;       &apos;. - I &apos; &apos;Private Cars for Business Use7. The number of private cars, licensed during the war did not fall belowabout, ,720,000, which may, therefore, be taken as an indication of the number of essential users. Not all essential cars can be classified as being &quot; for businessuse,&quot; but demobilisation and the switch from war to peace has probably increased the number of essential business cars. The level of sales to the home market Isnow under discussion with the manufacturers; if it is assumed that of the150,000 that have hitherto been sold annually in the home market, two-thirds, were for business use, it is believed that this number could be reduced by half without serious consequences so far as the investment aspect is concerned.Conclusion &apos;&quot;-8. The number of cars released to the home market for business use shouldbe reduced to 50,0009. On the recommendations in the foregoing paragraphs, the investment programme in 1948 for road vehicles and total production and exports wouldhe: 1948Units   millionCommercial (i) Public Service   .........        4,000 12(ii) Goods     ............      50,000 25Private cars for business use   ...      ...      50,000* 20Total ...      ...      ... ... 57* For all essential uses: value excludes purchase tax.APPENDIX 19TIMBER AND STEEL SUPPLIESTimber1. The future position of softwoods of which the building programme isa very large user Kmust be uncertain until the import programme for next year has been determined. But it is clear that since a substantial proportion of ourimported softwoods comes from hard currency sources, there must be heavy pressure to reduce imports as far as is practicable. *2. Compared with present allocations of softwoods, there will be increased demands next year to support the export drive (particularly for packing) andthe agricultural expansion programme.   These increases are estimated at about
125,000 standards in the year., The; housing programme now uses about 400,000standards in a year, and we estimate that, the demands to carry out our reducedhousing proposals would be at least 125,000 standards less in 1948 than in 1947,This roughly balances the increased demands which must be met. In addition tothis, a further saving of the order of 30,000 standards a year might come from therest of the building programme.3. The rising demands referred to above, plus the need to cut total imports,mean a Considerable reduction in the amount of timber which goes to building.The proposals we have made for the housing programme provide for the greatestcompletion of houses possible with restricted timber supplies. If, for currencyreasons, timber is not available to maintain the present total supply for ailpurposes, the consequential reduction of timber to housing would delay houses under construction and correspondingly strengthen the argument for postponingfurther work on a certain number of nouses which have only reached the damp-course level.-Steel ..,    ,      ,    ,   ,    ,     .    ,     &apos;.,   .  v ,    &apos; . V:   &apos;     &apos;4u Since steel will limit the execution of most investment programmesthroughout 1948, it has been necessary to- consider the effect of -%h&amp; ,&apos;Committee&apos;sproposals in relation to the steel supply prospects, and to the requirements ofother steel users. A final assessment, is not possible because the Materials Com-committee has not finished its enquiry into: the forward steel requirements for thefirst half of next year, and because steel supplies in the same period are stillsomewhat speculative. . There: is little reason to think, however, that the finalresults will differ much from those shown below.5. The attainment of the steel ingot target of 14 million tons for 1948(together with small imports) should make available for allocation 2-7 million tons a&apos; quarter in the first half of the year. This is equivalent to an additional144,000 tons a quarter over the estimated level of supplies, for the, last quarterof the current year.6. Consultation with the more important consuming Departments indicates that the requirements for exports and import saving and for the rising produc-tion programmes of industries in the priority list above the steel allocations forthese purposes in Period IV of 1947 are likely to increase by a good deal more-than the additional supplies in prospect.7.   The position can be presented as follows : DepartmentAdmiralty (Mercantile Marine)  ....      ...      ... ...      ..&quot;Ministry of Supply (Engineering Industry)   ... ...Ministry of Agriculture   ...      ...      .....      .... ...      ..Board of Trade (Home and Indirect Export)Board of Trade (Direct Export) ...      ... ...Total for Exporting Departments  .....;Additional requirements to meet rising departmental andpriority programmes-Mines      ...     ____      ...      ...      ...      ....      ...      ..Electricity programme ...      ...      ...      ...      ..Mining equipment       ...      ...      ...      ____Petroleum ..................Total    ...Additional requirements of bolts, nuts, springs and wire, &amp;c.Total additional requirements        .........Assumed additional steel available      ......      ...      .. .Prospective gap    ...      ...      ...      -.-Estimated AdditionalQuarterly Allocation Totalrequired above the ResultingAllocation for QuarterlyPeriod IV 1947 Allocation451.000!135,00033,00012,40075,000Tons1,045,600120,100,&apos;: 95,250265,000300,40013,0009,5006,75015,00044,25035,000379,650144,000235,650726,000219,000This provisional balance sheet assumes that other demands taken as a whole willnot be allowed to expand beyond their end 1947 levels.
8. The proposals made elsewhere in the Report will yield the following;quarterly contribution to the closure of the prospective gap : TonsBuilding programmes         ...      ...      ... ?9&apos;22aShipbuilding............ 15,000Gas industry ....      ...      ......      ... ....         5,000Electricity-power station plant    ...      ... ...         7,000Transport Wagons ...     &quot;......... ^,000Overseas oil programme (provisional) 20,000Total      ...      ............      ...      107,0009. The remainder of the &quot; gap&quot; might be closed by the following:measures i (a) The allocation of steel for direct export could be held at its present level,viz., 190,000 tons, in lieu of the stated requirement of 265,000 tons:In the present circumstances there are ho good grounds for exportingadditional steel, which could be converted for export at considerably higher values, save in the exceptional cases where it is absolutely necessary to do so in order to clinch an important trade negotiation.(&amp;) The requirement of the Ministry of Supply for the engineering indus-tries should be susceptible of reduction by 45,000 tons per quarterwithout endangering the export target or the other priorityprogrammes.(c) A reduction should also be possible in the additional requirements of theBoard of Trade for steel for home requirements and indirect export.The export element in these additional requirements amounts to only,000 tons. A cut of 5,000 tons is assumed here, even though itmay mean continued austerity for the home consumer.10-   The reductions in the proposed forecast requirements amount in total&apos;to 232,000 tons, viz. :-TonsReduction listed in paragraph 8    ...      ...      ...      107,000Direct Export of Steel        ...      ..:      ...      ...        75,000Engineering Industries       ...      ...      ...      ....       45,000Board of Trade (home civil) ......      ... 5,000Total       ............      ...      ...      232,000The prospective &apos;&apos; Gap &apos;&apos; for the first half of next year is thus reduced to5,000 tons per quarter which can be met by insignificant reductions all round.11. The Committee&apos;s investigations have shown the necessityvof bettermachinery for ensuring (i) that production and investment programmes are keptrealistically close to the probable level of raw material supplies and (ii) thatadjustments are made deliberately and in good time so as to avoid the dissipation,of effort on projects and programmes which may prove to be beyond the compassof the available resources. With this object in view it is recommended that asteel budget for the second half of 1948 should be drawn up as soon as possible,and that a continuous scrutiny should be maintained over new and changingproduction and investment programmes in order to secure a proper balance^between all the competing claims for steel in the light of the prospective supplies..
