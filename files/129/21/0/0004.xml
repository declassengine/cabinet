8 document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;s government)f    S e C R e t q ,COPY NO.mD \CP. (47) 2548th September,  1947.cabinet proposed EXTENSION OF HOURS IN the coalmining industry memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power the President*of the Board of Trade has rightly stressedin his memorandum C.P.(47) 250 the key importance to his vast newexport programme of considerably increased supplies of coal.But this coal can only be got if the miners, can be made torealise in time how much depends on their, making an extra effortwithout delay and sustaining it right through the winter.2. This effort in turn hinges on a speedy settlement of thenegotiations that have been dragging on since last July todetermine conditions governing the additional working time.     Andas the Government have become closely involved in this matter,the next step is, I suggest, for us to clear our own minds on thekind of settlement we should be prepared to regard as satisfactory3. Let us begin by dismissing non-starters.     Attractivethough the idea of an extra half-hour a day certainly is from many points.of view, I am forced to the conclusion that it wouldbe dangerous in present circumstances to press any measure whichrests, as the extra half-hour does, on any speedy reassessment ofstints.      The lesson to be...learned from the Grimethorpe strikeis clear:    nearly half the miners in Yorkshire came out on strike,not so much because they sympathised with the 132 men of theMelton Field Seam of the Grimethorpe Colliery, but because they feared that Grimethorpe was a prelude to an attempt to rush them into a wholesale reassessment of&apos;work without giving them a proper chance to have their say.      It is clear that if we press the half-hour proposal further, or in any way force the pace too much on reassessment of stints, we shall land ourselves in serioustroubles, of which the Grimethorpe strike, with its serious lossof output,   is giving us a foretaste.4. Thus, we are left to consider Saturday working, and what, should be its conditions.      The National Union of Mineworkerswere given at the meeting of 21st August a note of the conditionsthat the Government would require to be attached to Saturdayworking.     Those conditions made the bonus conditional on sixday working:    they also made over-time, for Saturday workconditional on the working of six shifts, although the foreign secretary indicated in the course of the,discussion that theGovernment might be prepared to reconsider this condition.      there and then, Mr. Lawther rejected the Governments proposal and fromconversations I hove had with him and Mr. Horner since, I amclear that the National Union of Mineworkers are unlikely to budge
Their argument is something like this.     Experience has shownthat some of the men cannot stand the heavy strain of workingsix shifts in a row, and this is more the case now than it ever was before.      The Five-Day Week recognised that while some could nodoubt work six shifts-it was unfair to set the pace for the whole industry by that of its strongest members.      Consequently, the bonus was given for the working of five continuous shifts and nowto withdraw the bonus from men who cannot manage six shifts.wouldnot only be grossly unfair, but also by destroying the bonusincentive over an appreciable part of the field, would increaseabsenteeism to an extent that might offset the extra efforts ofthose able to work six shifts.5* While I would not go as far as this, I am convinced thatthe suggestion that our proposal &quot;victimised&quot; the weaker men would arouse among the miners that loyalty for each other so marked inthe industry,  and that our proposal would stand no chance of acceptance.:    We must,  therefore, abandon it in favour of someother   proposal that leaves the five-day week bonus unaltered.6. Our only alternative is to rely on the over-time payment to provide the incentive for Saturday work.      I have considered whether we could attach to over-time payment on Saturdays thecondition that the miner should during the week have alreadyworked five shifts, i.e.  that unless the Saturday shift was the sixth shift it would be paid for at plain rates.     Reluctantly Iam forced to the conclusion, after discussing the matter with boththe National Coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers,that this condition would spoil our chances of getting the reasonable turn out-on Saturday needed to make Saturday workingpracticable.      If a man is going to miss one of six shifts allpaid at plain time rates, he will undoubtedly absent himself fromthe Saturday shift in preference to any other.7. Both sides agree that the terms of the present five-day week agreement should not be disturbed and they are at one in considering that Saturday-working must be-on. an organised basisdetermined very largely by local planning in the light of local circumstances.      They are discussing how this is to be done, but before the matter can be carried to a conclusion they must obviously have further guidance from the Government.8. In these circumstances, I recommend that subject to satisfactory arrangements for organising Saturday work, I should beauthorised to inform the Notional Coal Board and the National Unionof Mineworkers that the Government would not object to a solution ,on the following lines - &apos;(a) Miners should work two Saturdays in every four Saturdays;(b) The conditions should be those embodied in the presentfive-day week agreement, namely Saturday working attime and a half;(c) Where a full shift on Saturdays is practicable it shouldbe worked.The Board and the National Union of Mineworkers are having ameeting to-morrow, Tuesday, to clarify-the details,  and the NationalUnion of Mineworkers have called a-special meeting of their executive for Wednesday.     Before then it will be necessary for meto tell those concerned whether or   not the Government approveaction on the lines they are now considering.
9. The timing is important and we should, I think, aim at.getting matters to a point at which some agreement in principle&quot;between the National Coal Board and the National Union of mineworkers (subject to endorsement by the miners in the regions)can be announced this week.     The President of the Board ofTrade will, I am sure, agree that it is not going to be easy for him to secure acceptance of so massive an export programme and that one of the difficulties,  if not the main difficulty,will be that industries will be tempted to object (as indeed they objected not long ago in the West Riding) that indifferentcoal prospects &quot;robbed of all reality an appeal for a large increase in production.     We want to forestall&apos;&apos;this by anannouncement in Pridoy&apos;s Press, that subject to endorsement bythe rank and file and subject to settlement of the details inthe meantime, alternate Saturday working will, begin to operate on,  soy, Saturday, Uth October.-E.
