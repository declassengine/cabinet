(47) 26117th September, 1947CABINETRUHR COAL PRODUCTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will be aware that during the last few weeks a. party ofBritish officials, headed by Sir William Strang, has been in Washington discussing with the United States authorities various questions connected with the problemof increasing coal production in the Ruhr. These discussions came to an endlast week when the two delegations agreed upon a joint report to their respective governments. This report took the form of a confidential letter covering a formalreport. This report was in two parts, the first being mainly historical and thesecond containing a series of recommendations for future action. Attached tothis report were reports by working parties on food, mining supplies requirements,mine supplies and equipment and mine-workers&apos; housing. Of the foregoingdocuments, only the text of the formal report has been made public. The covering letter and the reports by the working parties have been treated as confidential.I now circulate for the information of my colleagues copies of all the documents in question.E.

CONFIDENTIALCOVERING LETTERTo the Government of the United States and the Government of theUnited KingdomREPORT   ON   THE   ANGLO-AMERICAN    TALKS   ON   RUHR   COALPRODUCTION1. Arising out of an invitation conveyed to Mr. Attlee on 30th June, 1947, by theUnited States Ambassador in London, HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United King-dom agreed to discussions at the official level in Washington on technical problems connected with increased coal productionin the Ruhr and neighbouring mining areasin Germany.2. The conversations began in Washing-ton on 12th August with a plenary session.They were continued by way of executivesessions and working parties. A list of themembers of the two delegations and their advisers is attached as an annex to this letter.3. A joint report embodying our reviewof the problem and our recommendationswas approved at the final plenary session on 10th September, 1947. We now beg tosubmit this report to the Governments ofthe United States and United Kingdom.4. In submitting this report we have feltthat our recommendations should excludematters of detail and any questions whichmight not be held fully to come within our terms of reference.5. There are. however, certain subjects on which we feel that more detailed in-formation would be useful. We accordinglyhave the honour to enclose copies of twoworking party reports on housing and minesupplies, with which we agree and whichwe have used in formulating our recommendations.6. We would also draw vour attention tothe recommendations on food contained inour report. These are confined to proposals in regard to the rationing system, a state-ment of the importance of maximisingindigenous collections, with certain pro-posals as to how this should be done, and asuggestion that the Rhine ports should beused for the unloading of inward food ship-Utents as an insurance against a repetition of last year&apos;s distributional breakdowns.We have not, however, included in thereport any recommendations in regard to food imports needed, which are such a vitalfactor in the general food supply position.7. It is in our view essential that themaximum quantities of grain within the approved programme be shipped into Ger-many particularly during the coming months. In view of the present worldgrain situation it is our opinion that foodsother than grains must also be purchasedin much greater quantities than heretoforeeven to ensure that the present ration of1.550 calories is fully met. It must berecognised that our ability to maintain orimprove present ration scales depends upon our being able to build up adequate stocks in Germany by the winter in preparation for the time when indigenous resources willhave been largely exhausted and the main-tenance of ration scales will therefore be dependant upon imported supplies.8. In considering the German foodproblem we have had the advantage of a working party report prepared by expertswhich we have the honour to submit to youherewith. That report rightly points outthat the problem of food for the Ruhr isinseparable from the wider problem of food for the whole bizonal area. It furtherdraws attention to the deterioration in theworld supply position that has taken place during the past few weeks and makes cer-tain proposals in regard to the types and quantities of food-stuffs which should beprocured to meet both the 1,550- and the1,800-calorie ration scales. It also makescertain recommendations in regard to the relaxation of the present machinery of pro-procurement in respect both of purchasesundertaken by the two zone commandersand by external procurement agencies.Although certain recommendations of the experts&apos; report may fall outside the scopeof the coal talks, we are firmly convincedthat the food problem of Germany must be solved or all other efforts to improve coal production will be of no avail. A satis-factory solution can only be achieved if themeasures  recommended  in  the  experts&apos;14315   34240b
report, or others of an equally effectivenature, are carried out imw lately and werecommend that they be brought withoutdelay to the notice of the competent authorities of the two Governments. It is recognised that financial considerations arealso involved which must be given im-mediate attention if these urgent supplyrecommendations are to be carried out.9. We have been impressed in our studies of the various aspects of present german economic life which affect coal output bythe serious adverse effect of the lack of con-fidence in the reichsmark. We have shown the important part played by food in coal production and, in the food supply positiongenerally., by the collection of indigenousfood-stuffs. We recognise, however, thatthe greatest deterrent to the farmer in de-livering up his produce is that the moneyhe receives for his crops cannot be spenton consumer goods and the uncertaintywhich he feels in regard to its future pur-chasing power. This uncertainty in regardto the value of the currency, coupled withthe scarcity of goods, reduces the induce-ment to work and has led to the necessitySeptember 1947of such measures as miners&apos; incentiveschemes. Moreover, the present price strut,ture in Germany is out of line both intet.nally and in relation to world price levels.Finally, the ceiling which has been imposeion price and wage levels has removed fromthe trade unions their long recognise^right to engage in collective bargainiiijlNone of these evils can be eliminate!without the introduction of measures ojfinancial reform which will have as theitobjective not only the reduction of monejlin circulation, but also price adjustment&apos;including an exchange value for the reichs-mark.  We accordingly recommend that Iimmediate consideration should be given tthe adoption of the necessary corrects imeasures.10. Finally, we would like to emphasistonce again the vital importance of an earljsolution of the German transport problemUnless such a solution can be found, there&apos;will be a serious set-back, not only to Gei-man recovery, but to the plans now undeiconsideration in Paris for the recovery iWestern Europe as a whole.WILLIAM STRANG.WILLARD THORP.TABLE OF contents part I.

3109REPORT ON ANGLO-AMERICAN TALKS ON RUHR COALPRODUCTIONPart I. Review of Hard Coal Problem in Ruhr-Aachen Area sincethe Capitulationfesponsibility for Control of Coal Mining1. At the time of the occupation of western Germany the control of the hardcoal mining industry in the Ruhr-Aachenarea was the responsibility of an Anglo-American organisation, G.4 Solid FuelsSection of S.H.A.E.F. In July 1945, this responsibility was transferred to a Britishorganisation, the North German CoalControl, which continues to be the author-ity in the British Zone of Germany con-trolling the production and distribution ofcoal.2. The functions of the N.G.C.C. havebeen to formulate policies designed toincrease coal production, to issue the neces-sary directives and to ensure their execu-tion through a system of inspections. Theday-to-day management and operation ofthe individual mines is in the hands ofGerman technicians.3. On 1st January, 1947, with the cominginto force of the Fusion Agreement, UnitedStates representatives became joint mem-bers with the British of the Coal Produc-tion Committee in Berlin, which had beenestablished by the British Zone Commanderlate in 194(3. The object of this committeewas to consider difficulties arising in con-nexion with coal production and to issue instructions to appropriate agencies.United States representatives have thusparticipated with the British in estab-lishing overall coal production policy sincethe beginning of 1947. Recently, the com-mittee has had under discussion the trans-fer of central managerial responsibility forthe coal mining industry to German handsunder United States-United kingdom control.State of Mining Industry at the Capitula-tion4. WKen the Ruhr area was occupied in1945, coal production which had previous-ously exceeded 400,000 tons per day had fallen to about 30,000 tons a day. Themining area had been extensively damagedas a result of bombing and later groundwarfare. Mines representing about 10 percent, of the normal production were so. severely damaged that it has not yet been^possible to restore them. Of the mines nowin production some 25 per cent, were verybadly (damaged, presenting a serious pro-blem of reconstruction and repair. -342405. The effective labour force of some400,000 (daily man shifts worked) had, bythe time of the capitulation, been reducedto a little over 100,000. The balance repre-sented foreign forced labour which hadbeen obtained throughout German Occu-pied Europe in order to permit the able-bodied German miners to enter the armed forces. These foreign miners were sud-denly released after the surrender and left the mines.6. In the general devastation of the ruhr area, miners&apos; housing was extensivelydamaged. Out of a total of 250,000 miners&apos;houses, 66,000 were completely destroyed and 130,000 were damaged in varying degrees.  -7. There was a complete cessation in themanufacture of mining supplies. Stocksof machinery and the large variety of essen-tial stores were very much depleted. Inparticular, there was an acute shortage ofpitwood, many large stocks having been destroyed by fire.8. Transport was completely dis-organised and industrial activity generallywas almost at a standstill. Coal loadingand distribution facilities were eitherdamaged or incapable of use because of thedestruction of many of the railroadmarshalling yards and locomotives and much of the rolling-stock as well as the blocking of the Rhine and the entire canalsystem by blasted bridges.9. These were the major problems facing the Occupying Powers and efforts were directed to their solution.Reconstruction of Labour Force10. Immediate steps were taken toestablish a recruiting system for the mines and in August 1945 the German LabourOffices were re-established. Through these offices, 35,000 ex-miners from the pri-soners-of-war held in the British Zone were directed to the mines by the middle ofAugust 1945. Later, recruitment was extended to all able-bodied men betweenthe ages of 18 and 35 years who, if not inessential employment, were directed to the mines. Mining was accorded first priority in the supply of labour, a position whichit has enjoyed ever since.11. By these means the effective labour force was increased to some 200,000 by theend of 1945.   During the greater part of 2
1946, the intake of labour, only a small proportion of which was by voluntary recruitment, was no more than sufficientto balance the wastage. Thus in December1946 the effective labour force had onlyreached 210,000.12. A wage increase in November 1946,followed by the introduction of the&quot;Points Scheme&quot; in January 1947,resulted in a considerable increase in therate of recruitment. This made it nolonger necessary to direct labour as menjoined the industry on a voluntary basis.The present effective labour force is247,000 (daily man shifts worked).13. A large proportion of the new labour has been recruited within the Ruhr area,and this has had serious repercussions onthe labour requirements of the railwaysand other key industries. It was necessary,therefore, in the early spring of 1947, toextend recruitment to areas outside the ruhr including the southern portion of thebizonal area. At the present time thereis a net increase in the total mining labour force of approximately 1,000 per week.Training14. The new labour recruited to the mines was almost entirely unskilled. Sofar as the adult labour was concerned,training merely consisted of working along-side skilled miners. In 1945 it was realised that attention would have to begiven to the training of youths for themining industry since this would be thenormal source of labour for the future. Itwas considered advisable to restore immedi-ately the training facilities including themining, technical and training institutes.In December 1945 there were over 5,000youths undergoing training in these schools.  The present figure is 14,000.Labour Relations15. At the time of the occupation therewere no means of negotiation between management and labour. As an interim measure, workers&apos; representatives were elected at each mine. Later, these weresuperseded by works&apos; councils appointed in accordance with Control Council LawNo. 22.16. Meanwhile progress was made in re-establishing the Miners&apos; Trade Union,which was finally constituted towards theend of 1946. So far as possible the tradeunion has been encouraged to perform itsrightful functions within the industry.The views of the Administrative board have been frequently obtained on matters affecting labour and the general running of the industry.   The trade union leaders have taken an active part in the efforts ofthe men to step up production.17. In this respect the fact that themanshift output in 1938 was 1-5 tons ascompared with approximately 1 ton at thepresent time should not be considered as evidence that the German miners to-day ailnot co-operative. Many factors are responsible for reduced efficiency, includinguneven and often insufficient supplies offood, inadequate housing conditions, the unskilled character of a large portion ofthe labour force and failures of equipmentdue to lack of maintenance and supplies.18. In order that the mine workers majlco-operate in the production of coal, &apos;joint production committee has been establlished at each mine.   Matters affecting!production and the general working con-Jditions of the mine are freely discussed between the members representing labouiand management.   In January 1947 thecommittees were co-ordinated with group and District Joint Production Committees.This has enabled comprehensive plans for future development to be produced withthe active participation of the workmen.Mine Discipline and Denazification19. Good relations between management and labour and good discipline are a pre-requisite to efficient and safe working ofthe mines.20. Up to October 1946, when denazifi-cation was in progress in the miningindustry, there was a constant feeling ofinsecurity among the managerial staffengendered by threats of denunciation,which were often a prelude to dismissal.This particularly affected the immediatesupervisors, who are more intimately asso-ciated with the workmen with the resultthat good discipline no longer existed.21. In August 1946 a special commis-sion was set up fully representative of theindustry to complete the denazification ofthe mining industry. This commissionfinished its task in October 1946 andBritish Military Government thereuponannounced the completion of denazifica-tion within the industry.22. Matters then improved, but furtherunrest occurred when, by quadripartiteagreement, &quot; categorisation &quot; of formermembers of the Nazi Party was institutedthis year. This, among other things, estab-lished a classification system determining the grade of employment, if any, for whicbjsuch former members were eligible. Anannouncement was issued in July 1947 that although &quot;categorisation&quot; would pro-ceed, the report by the commission referredto in the preceding paragraph had already

Good relations between management and labour and good discipline are a pre-requisite to efficient and safe working ofthe mines.20. Up to October 1946, when denazifi-cation was in progress in the miningindustry, there was a constant feeling ofinsecurity among the managerial staffengendered by threats of denunciation,which were often a prelude to dismissal.This particularly affected the immediatesupervisors, who are more intimately asso-ciated with the workmen with the resultthat good discipline no longer existed.21. In August 1946 a special commis-sion was set up fully representative of theindustry to complete the denazification ofthe mining industry. This commissionfinished its task in October 1946 andBritish Military Government thereuponannounced the completion of denazifica-tion within the industry.22. Matters then improved, but furtherunrest occurred When, by quadripartiteagreement, &apos;&apos; categorisation &apos;&apos; of formermembers of the Nazi Party was institutedthis year. This, among other things, estab-lished a classification system determining the grade of employment, if any, for whicsuch former members were eligible. Anannouncement was issued in July 1947 that although &quot; categorisation&quot; would pro-ceed, the report by the commission referredto in the preceding paragraph had already
resulted in the denazification of the indus-try and that, therefore, no further dis-missals could arise. Thus the feeling of uncertainty in the minds of the managerialstaff has been removed and has resulted inimproved discipline and better relationsbetween labour and management.Wages23. During 1945 and 1946 it was apparent that the miner was dissatisfied with his wage position in relation to otherindustries. The miners&apos; wage was ninthon the scale of industrial wages whereasfor many years it had occupied first place.The position was improved late in 1946,when, by quadripartite agreement, theminers&apos; wages were increased by 20 percent.Social Insurance24. The German coal miner had for along time enjoyed a privileged position inrespect of social security with benefits&apos; and pensions higher than in any other industry.In 1945 and 1946, owing to internal finan-cial difficulties, reductions were made inthe amounts paid to the miner and hisdependents under the social insurancescheme. This caused considerable dissatis-faction, particularly with the older miners,and had an adverse effect upon coal pro-duction. Early in 1947 the full pre-warbenefits and pensions were restored.Food and other Incentives25. The most important single factoraffecting coal production since the occupa-tion has been the food supply, which hasfluctuated considerably during the past two years. Early in 1945 the basic foodration was 1,100 calories per day, but, byadditional feeding at the mine canteens,the miner&apos;s ration was raised to 2,800calories per day. By the middle of 1945 itwas possible to increase the normal con-sumer&apos;s ration to 1,500 and that of theminer to 3,400 calories per day. this position was maintained up to March 1946.26. On 4th March, 1946, the normal con-sumer&apos;s ration was reduced to 1,014calories per day and the miner&apos;s ration to2,900 calories per day as the result ofinsufficient stocks of food. From 24thJune, 1946, the underground minersreceived daily extra sandwiches with a food value of 500 calories. In August 1948200 calories extra per day were given toall consumers in the large towns in theUnited States and United Kingdom Zonesand in small towns in the Ruhr area.In October 1946 the normal consumer&apos;sscale was raised to 1,550 and the miner&apos;sto 4,000 calories per day.27. In March 1947 a critical food shortage again developed throughout theBizonal area, which was especially severein the Ruhr. The reduced food deliverieswere due in part to difficulties consequent upon the very severe winter and for a timeto some delays in food arrivals fromabroad, but to an even greater extent to thefailure of the Germans themselves to collect the agreed quotas of food fromindigenous sources. The normal con-sumer&apos;s ration was in effect reduced toabout 1,200 calories, which meant that theminer averaged some 3,600 calories per day. In fact he consumed less than this because he shared more of his ration withhis family.28. Food demonstrations broke out inthe Ruhr area, including work stoppagescausing serious losses in coal production,which did not start to recover until July,when a better food situation developed.29. During 1946 the possibility of pro-viding incentives to production was dis-cussed. The &quot; Points Scheme&quot; wasevolved and introduced in January 1947.Under this scheme the miner is able, byregular attendance and, to some extent,by improved productivity, to earn anumber of points and coupons each monthenabling him to purchase additional food and consumer goods which are otherwiseunobtainable. It is certain that the&apos;&apos; Points Scheme &apos;&apos; lessened the effect whichthe food shortage had on production inMarch of this year.30. In July 1947, since production wasnot rising as had been hoped, consideration was given to additional incentives and anew scheme was jointly adopted embodyingthree distinct phases of which the last twoalso applied to the brown coal workers.Phase I applies to underground workersin each hard coal mine which reaches a production target within a sixteen-weekperiod commencing 28th July, 1947. this target is the highest level of production over a consecutive four-week period sincethe beginning of the occupation. Eachunderground worker in a mine whichreaches or exceeds this target in a con-consectutive four-week period will receive one&apos;&apos; ten-in-one &apos;&apos; ration package, - madeavailable from United States army stocks.Each package contains food with an equivalent of 40,000 calories.Phase II guarantees to each employee ofa mine which reaches its production targetand maintains or improves it that his total
individual food ration will be met to thefull calorie value exclusive of any benefits under the &quot; Points Scheme.&quot;Phase III provides for setting aside a proportion of the foreign exchange pro-ceeds from the export of coal for the pur-chase abroad of food and consumer goodsdesired by the miner.   1Miners&apos; Housing31. Immediately after occupation itwas recognised that improvement in thehousing Of the miners was a matter of major importance. In 1945 and early 1946most of the repairs undertaken were carried out by the collieries. considerable progress was made in spite of the shortageof materials. By the middle of 1946,95,000 miners&apos; dwelling units in the Ruhrhad been repaired.32. At this time a five-year plan for housing, including miners&apos; housing, wasformulated by the land authorities.Execution of the plan was retarded by shortage of materials, but 2,000 Nissenhuts were obtained for conversion intodwellings and a number of prefabricatedhouses were built. In April 1947 the five-year plan was reviewed by a United States-United Kingdom working party and anaccelerated two-year plan exclusively for miners&apos; housing resulted. To produce thenecessary materials for the latter plan aspecial allocation of coal was made to thebuilding industries effective in July 1947.Mine Repairs and Supplies33. Another major problem facing theControl Authorities at the capitulationwas the repair of the severely damagedmine plants. Despite much depletedstocks of mining machinery and stores,temporary repairs were made at many ofthe colliery plants and partial productionresumed. Many of the working levels ata number of mines had been flooded,necessitating intensive dewatering withimprovised equipment.34. The potential capacity of the minesat the present time is 350,000 tons per daygiven the men, materials and the neces-sary transport. Any increase over this level will require extensive repairs and theprovision of new machinery. This applies to many of the mines in production, the capacity of which is restricted by damage to shaft, plant and other essential equip-ment and also to the mines too badly damaged to be restored up to the presenttime. In order to restore the full pre-warproductive capacity it is estimated that the steel requirements alone will amount to between 1,500.000 and 2 million tons.35. The mining supplies position hasbeen difficult from the beginning of theoccupation. Among other things, the materials which have been in short supplyare : steel, chemicals, rubber belting andhose, electrical equipment and miners&apos;&apos;work clothing. The supply of pitwood hasbeen a cause of anxiety. Even at thecurrent production rate stocks are far fromadequate to ensure continuity of working.Mechanisation36. Attention has been given to furthermechanisation of coal mining. Two im-portant machines have been developed-the coal-plough and the cutter-loader -bothof which simultaneously extract and loadthe coal. The former has the wider appli-cation and has already demonstrated anincrease of 30 to 40 per cent, in the man-shift output at the coal-face where used.Although only in an experimental stageat the time of occupation, there are nowsome thirty of these machines at work andtwenty-three complete installations are on order with the German manufacturers forwhich the material is being made available.Financial Condition of the Mines37.&apos; Owing to the quadripartite policy ofmaintaining a price ceiling the internalselling price of coal has remained fixed atan average of RM.15-75 per ton. Withthe low rates of output production costs are far higher and even at the current rateof production are about RM.32 per ton.The operating losses from the date ofoccupation to 30th June, 1947, areapproximately RM.1,800 million, against which RM.1,202 million have been advanced from central revenues.Transportation38. Throughout the period of the occu-pation there has been a lack of adequatetransportation to distribute coal. In theearly months good progress was made inthe restoration of the railway system, the rhine and the canals. The debris fromblown bridges was cleared away. Tem-porary bridges were erected to allow wideroperation and, by the end of 1945, thetransport of coal was possible by rail, road and inland waterways. During early 1945nearly 6 million tons of coal and coke hadbeen stock-piled in the vicinity of the Ruhr *mines because of destruction of the&apos;transport system during military opera-tions. By December 1945 the transport system was not only moving current coal
illproduction but began to reduce the stock-i piles.    The  situation  improved  during1946, when all but the emergency stocksrequired at the collieries were moved.39. During the last winter -the worstin fifty years transportation became so seriously curtailed that only essential food-stuffs and a limited supply of coal could be moved at all. Furthermore, since thebeginning of 1947, due to growingdemands upon tine transport system, it has again become a limiting factor and stock-piles are once more accumulating at the mines, the free stocks now amounting toabout 1,250,000 tons.Production Trend40. From a negligible output at the timeof the capitulation production reached60,000 tons per day in July 1945 and167,000 tons at the end of the year. Theincrease continued in the early part of1946 until by March production had reached 180,000 tons per day. The reduc-tion in the food ration mentioned in para-graph 26 caused a decrease in outputreaching its lowest figure in April with an.average of 150,000 tons per day. Recoveryafter that was slow and uneven. Produc-tion did not again reach 180,000 tons per day until October 1946, when a higher foodration level was established.41. The stimulus of the wage increasein November 1946 and the introduction ofthe &quot;Points Scheme&quot; in January 1947caused a considerable increase in output,reaching an average in March 1947 of234,000 tons per day, with a peak produc-tion of 238,480 tons. Reference to para-graphs 27 and 28 will show &apos;the criticalfood situation which developed at this time. This had an adverse effect on pro-duction and the daily average fell to219,000 tons in April and 216,000 tons inMay. The improved food situation in the ruhr in July and August 1947, togetherwith the implementation of the latestincentive scheme, has resulted in anincreased rate of coal production, so thatthe average daily output for the month ofAugust is 13,000 tons higher than in july and on 4th September there was a newdaily record since the occupation of244,080 tons.Part II.-recommendations. Management and control in accordance with the provisions ofparagraph 3 of the Fusion Agreement of2nd December, 1946, the two Zone Com-manders have had under consideration theestablishment under their joint control ofa German Administration for the - coalindustry in the bizonal provisional agreement has been reached between them on the steps necessary to achieve this.Under this provisional agreement (a) Responsibility for coal production would be transferred to german hands through the establishment ofa German Coal Management respon-sible to the United States-UnitedKingdom Military Governments forthe efficient operation of the coalindustry.(&amp;) There would be United States^United Kingdom supervision of theGerman Coal Management through a United States-United kingdom control Group, which would issueappropriate directives to the Ger-man Coal Management on behalf ofUnited States-United kingdom military Government.(c) The German Bizonal economic council will set up a department inthe Economic Administration toundertake   as   one   of   its   mainresponsibilities the functions nor-mally exercised by a GovernmentDepartment in respect to the coalindustry.(d) Provision would be made for safe-guarding the interests of non-German owners of coal-miningproperty,(e) The question of the ownership of the mines would not be affected.We have had this provisional agreement under consideration and recommend itsapproval in principle by the twoGovernments.We also recommend that as soon as the consultations on the provisional agreementnow being conducted by the United Statesand the United Kingdom governments with the French, Belgian, Netherlands and luxembourg Governments have been con-cluded, the coal management agreement should be put into operation.In the meantime, the first steps towardsthe replacement of the North German CoalControl by the United States^-UnitedKingdom Control Group provided for inthe Coal Management Agreement should betaken. The United States Zone Gom-mander should accordingly appoint a united States official to act as joint chair-man of the North German Coal Control,and an appropriate number of United
States officials should be appointed to theNorth German Coal Control to exercise such functions as may be determined by thejoint chairmen.The North German Coal Control shouldcontinue to operate but, with its composi-tion thus amended, would become an Anglo-American body acting under the directionof the Bipartite Board.When the Coal Management agreement is brought into operation the United States-United Kingdom Control Group shouldbe fully constituted and the North german coal Control should cease to exist.2. Food SupplyWe have examined the food situation inGermany with special reference to its effecton mining and coal production, and we are convinced that the most important singlefactor in increasing output is to improve the food position in the mining areas. Itis the unanimous opinion of those respon-sible for coal production that the first essential step in this direction is to ensurethat the present ration scale is regularlyand punctually met.We therefore attach particular impor-tance to the regular and punctual honour-ing of the full 1,550-calorie ration in themining districts and generally throughoutthe whole of the bizonal area at the earliest opportunity. The lack of adequate stockshas hitherto been one of the difficulties in maintaining regular distribution in meeting the official ration, particularly inthe Ruhr and in large cities throughout thebizonal area. In order to provide amechanism which, within the limits of thesupplies available,, will permit the most efficient distribution, we recommend thatlarger stocks be kept in such localities thanin the bizonal area generally.The regular and punctual honouring ofthe 1,550-calorie ration throughout thewhole of the bizonal area, under theexisting unsatisfactory world supply situa-tion, will be no easy matter, and much will depend upon Germany making themaximum&apos; contribution towards her own needs from her indigenous resources. Ifthe time is reached when stockpiles canbe further increased and additional supplies both from indigenous resources and imports are sufficiently assured, werecommend that successive nation in-creases towards the 1,800-calorie targetshould be made only when there is reason-able expectation that the higher rationlevel can be actually maintained. Con-sidenation should be given to makingincreases first by a supplemental ration in large cities for the Reason that supplies ofoff-the-ration foods are known to be 50 to100 calories less in such cities than elsewhere, and to treating small cities and towns in the Ruhr-Aachen area for thispurpose upon the same basis as the large cities because the close proximity of so many small towns to each other is such thatthe condition of off-the-ration food is comparable to that of a large city.We emphasise that the attainment of the1,800-calorie target throughout the bizonalarea at the earliest opportunity should con-tinue to be our next objective. Withoutprogressive improvement in ration scalesit will not be possible to produce economicconditions within Germany which will Ienable the pre-war coal production levels&apos;to be approached.As we have already mentioned, it is imperative to ensure that the maximumavailable tonnage of indigenous foodstuffsis delivered up by farmers. In order to achieve this we recommend that consideration should be given to the following measures: (a) Stricter enforcement of penalties forevasion and possibly an increase inthe scale of those penalties.(b) The allocation of available suppliesof fertiliser, seed tools, and farmequipment in such a manner as to favour  those  farmers whose de-11 liveries against collection quotas are most satisfactory.(c) The development of the inspectionsystem, both German and Allied. Iiiview of the difficulties in obtainingsufficient reliable German inspectors,spot-checking by competent Alliedstaffs under top-level supervisionseems necessary on a larger scale than at present in force.(d) Adequate publicity concerning theresults of collections in each land and also as to the penalty systems inforce and the methods of inspectionemployed.We would also draw attention to thetransport difficulties which during the pasteight months have interrupted the regularsupply of food to Germany. This has been partly due to the routeing of food shipments to German ports only, and moving themthence over the German transport system with a view to avoiding external transitcosts. To improve the future flow of food supplies to the Ruhr, consideration hasalready been given, to the use of Rotterdamand Antwerp as entry ports as was the pre-war practice. If the pending negotiationswith the Netherlands and Belgian Govern-ments for the use of Rhine ports can be
brougM to a satisfactory conclusion, an im-portant step in ensuring regular food sup-plies to the Ruhr will have been taken.Mine Supplies and EquipmentThere is at present a considerable loss finally output due to mechanical breakdowns.These mainly occur in badly worn parts ofthe equipment, which has been inadequatelymaintained since 1940. We believe it tobe an essential prerequisite to increasedcoal production that the deterioration of mining equipment be arrested forth -with and that it be brought &apos; into an efficient state of repair without delay.Therefore, we entirely agree with therecent decision taken by our two ZoneCommanders to increase the allocation ofsteel for the mining industry. In additionwe recommend that certain essential short-term steel and other requirements for themining industry be imported into germany during the next six months so as to preventfurther deterioration of equipment and put the industry on the way to recovery.Our proposals for this and for some imme-diate requirements of the transport indus-try envisage immediate imports by theJoint Export-Import Agency valued at about 25 million dollars. This in additionto surplus army property which is beingmade available.We also call attention to the fact that even at the current production rate stocksof pit-wood are far from adequate toensure continuity of operations. We there-fore recommend that steps be taken to accelerate delivery of pit-wood from withinthe bizonal area and from the other zonesin order to build up stocks sufficientlybefore the winter. So far as longer-term requirements are concerned these havebeen put forward by the British ZoneCommander with the approval of hisAmerican colleague to the Paris Con-ference and have not therefore been takeninto consideration here. Such a longer-term programme for rehabilitation and recon-struction which will be necessary to reachpre-war coal production, including thefinancial implications, should be worked out by the two Zone Commanders and consideration given to its implementationduring the next few months. It seems likely that the equipment demands of theGerman coal mining industry can be met toa substantial extent from German economyprovided financial assistance is forthcomingfor the import of essential industrial rawmaterials.4. MechanisationWe have considered how far Germanproduction could be increased by the intro-duction into the Ruhr of Americanmining machinery. After taking expert advice we have reached the conclusion that,having regard to the natural conditions inthe Ruhr coalfield, the methods so success-fully employed in the mining of coal in theUnited States are not immediately applic-able. However, great advantage might be derived from American technical experi-ence and advice when further development is justified on the basis of available funds,labour and materials; and we feel that con-si deration should be given at an early date to an expert engineering study of the Ruhrmines by representatives of the Americancoal industry.5. Mine Workers&apos; HousingWe have considered the current two-year programme for improving miners&apos;housing and find ourselves in generalagreement with it. We are, however, con-cerned about the difficulty in the way of its execution which has arisen as a result ofinternal budgetary considerations. Werecommend that ways and means be foundto solve this problem. Special considera-tions relating to coal mining and minedevelopment seem to us to call for a greatervoice by the industry in the housing of itsemployees than is normal in other indns-tries. This has been recognised in the past and is evidenced by the fact that about SOper cent, of the miners&apos; houses are mineproperty. We recommend that the UnitedStates-United Kingdom Control Group, inconsultation with the German Coal. Man-encouragement  and the competent Land authori-ties, take the requisite action and workout whatever organisational adjustmentsare necessary to ensure that the detailedprogramming of miners&apos; housing and theprovision and sub-allocation of materials are carried out in a manner to implementfully the two-year programme.6. Mine Workers&apos; IncentivesWe are of the opinion that the questionof inducing workers in Germany to produce to their maximum capacity will not be fully solved until their efforts can be re-warded by payment in currency of morestable value with reasonable access to thegoods of which they are in need. Theminer, on whose efforts the recovery of thewhole country primarily depends, has beengiven special recognition. The privilegesextended to him which are tied partly to34240c
good attendance and partly to good produc-tion, have undoubtedly led to a higher coaloutput, and we are in agreement with them,but we consider that any further extensionof them must be examined with the greatest care and in the light of the need to expandthe remainder of German industry.7. Wages and Social SecurityWe have examined the scale of miners&apos;wages and are of the opinion that they are adequate in relation to those of other in-dustries. At the end of 1946 they were raised by 20 per cent., and the miningemployment is now amongst the highestpaid in the bizonal area. We are similarlyof the opinion that the social security ofthe miner is better reserved by his in-surance benefits than that of any otherworker.8. Labour RecruitingThe coal-mining industry has enjoyed anoverriding priority over the demands for labour from all other industries. Thelabour force, including surface as well asunderground labour, has increased from about 132,000 in July 1945 to about 320,000in June of this year. Recruitment is now on an entirely voluntary basis and is ex-ceeding wastage by about 1,000 men a week.It is probable that recruits are almost allattracted by the incentive schemes and privileges which the miner enjoys over theremainder of the community. We considerthat the present rate of intake is as high as existing facilities will currently accom-accommodate. As other industries develop, theremay be a considerable shortage of labourbetween the ages of 18 and 40 becauseGerman man-power has been seriouslydepleted by war. Up to now a large partof the mining labour force has been re-recruited from Land North Rhine/West-phalia which contains the industrial heart of Germany. It is important that thepreference the coal mines enjoy should notunduly drain the remainder of industry ofthe man-power it requires. We, therefore,regard it as essential that recruitment forthe mines should continue effectively overthe whole of the bizonal area. This willalso have the effect of impressing on theentire population the vital necessity forincreased coal production.9. Labour Relations and Collective Bar-gainingWe have examined the relationship be-tween management and labour through themedia of the Miners&apos; Trade Union, works&apos;councils and joint production committees.We have no specific recommendation tomake in this field other than to point tothe necessity for financial reform, without which the present wage ceiling cannot be lifted and the normal process of collective bargaining between the trade union andthe management resumed.10. Transportation f)We are concerned about the inability ofthe transport system in the bizonal area tolift all the coal which is now available foruse and it appears to us that all efforts which have been made and the measures now prCposed to raise coal production willbe of no avail if the transport capacity isnot raised simultaneously. The needs ofGerman transport in the bizonal area havebeen set out in a paper for the Paris Con-ference which was prepared by the british zone Commander with the approval of hisUnited States colleague. From a study ofthis paper, the immediate needs of the rail-ways appear to us to be beyond the present world availability particularly in railwayrolling stock, of which there is a dearth inevery country. The only immediate shortterm solution would appear therefore to lie1in the greater use of road and water transport.It appears to us essential that a detailed study of the transport problem in the bi-zonal area should be undertaken imme-&apos;diately because, if a solution is not foundvery quickly, the attempts to raise coal production which are now showing someresults will become abortive. The success which has attended the Berlin Coal Pro-duction Committee suggests similar treat-ment of the transport problem. recently the two Zone Commanders have set up acommittee to accelerate the rehabilitation of transport and we heartily endorse this action.With regard to the particular problem ofcoal, we are agreed that, as a first step,special measures must be taken to providerolling stock to move the coal arising from increased production.We therefore strongly recommend thefollowing emergency measures : (a) The   highest   practicable   priority should be given to the supply ofsteel and other materials necessaryfor the repair of the transport re-.   quired to move coal.(6) Increased use of short-haul truck(road) transport to relieve theburden on rail. In March, as ahemergency measure, 223,000 tons ftcoal a week were moved by truck(road). Recently less than 50 percent, of this weekly tonnage was
11113being moved by truck (road). the seriousness of the situation seems tous to warrant the maximum use oftruck (road) transport.(c) Increased use of water facilities bycompleting negotiations with theLow Countries for use of theirports, barges and tugs, to relieve railfacilities from Bremen and Ham-burg.(d) Renewal of negotiations withneighbouring European countries,particularly Czechoslovakia andBelgium, for repair of immobilerolling stock now in Germany.11. Financial Position of the MinesWe have considered the question of theinternal price of coal and feel that thepresent position under which cost of pro-duction exceeds the selling price by as muchas 16 Reichsmarks per ton is very unsatis-factory. We realise that as output in-creases production costs will fall and the deficit per ton will gradually be reduced.We recognise the objections to an increasein the price of coal alone, but feel that if no general adjustment in tfhe internal pricestructure is at present possible some imme-diate increase in coal prices should be givenserious consideration. Without this it willbe impossible to establish healthy financial conditions in the industry.12. Utilisation of German Resources for coal ProductionIt is recognised that breaking the bottle-neck of coal production, which is necessary if Germany is to play its role in european economic recovery, is dependent onimproved food supply and the developmentof the basic industries on which coal pro-duction depends, such as transportation,iron and steel and electric power. It is,therefore, essential that the allocation ofthe limited resources available to germany should take full account of this. Thereshould be full realisation of this need by military Government and by german authorities at all levels. The latter shouldbe invested with the necessary authority and held responsible for ensuring that therequirements which can and must be satis-fied from the German economy are dulymet, as the financial resources available willseverely limit imports. While recognising the desirability of encouraging Germanresponsibility for administration, weshould insist that the German people andthe German authorities adopt and imple-ment all necessary measures of economy and self-help to achieve the programme for increasing the availability of coal for germany and for Western Europe.ANGLO-AMERICAN CONVERSATIONS REGARDING GERMAN coal production,  WASHINGTON,  D.C.Revised List oe ParticipantsUnited KingdomChairman:Sir William Strang, Political Adviser to theCommander-in-Chief, Germany.Delegates:Sir Mark Turner, Adviser on German economic matters to the Foreign Office.D.

They have con-sidered the question under the following headings and have made joint recom-meridations in each case : 1. Acceleration of Housing Programme(a) BackgroundA five-year programme of repair and construction of miners&apos; housing was pre-pared last year by the Ruhr Regional Plan-ning Authority (German) of Land NorthRhine-Westphalia. After examination bya joint United States-United Kingdomworking party which met in Germany inApril this year, recommendations weremade which resulted in the adoption of anaccelerated two-year programme by the planning authority, an analysis of whichis given at Appendix A. This programmevisualised the repair of all repairableminers&apos; houses. It will make available216,211 housing units for miners&apos; familiesincluding some new construction plus 524hostels   to  accommodate   approximately26,000 single miners. The necessary coalis being allocated to building material pro-ducers to provide the supplies to meet therequirements of the building programme.The two-year programme became effective in July 1947.Up to that time, the bulk of the repair and reconstruction work necessary to pro-vide shelter and housing for Ruhr minerswas carried out by the mines with theirown material and labour. This work was confined entirely to housing owned by the mines and located on their property.(b) Recommendations(1) The two-year plan as described above is considered adequate to effect the mini-mum necessary improvement in the housingof the present labour force and to providehousing for the 100,000 additional minersrequired.(2) Attention is drawn to the need to findand train whatever additional buildingforce may be required under the plan.(3) The two delegations recommend thatthe use . of pre-fabricated houses, &apos; asincluded in the plan, be carefully re-exam-ined to determine whether their use can be
justified from the standpoint of cost,transport and adaptability.(4) While the increased monthly allot-ment of 28,000 tons of coal, to provide forthe manufacture of building materials forRuhr miners&apos; housing, is consideredadequate, the two delegations are concerned about the supply of the necessary sawnlumber and timber products and also of domestic fittings; this matter should be investigated without delay in Germany, gothat the necessary priorities are assured.2. Responsibility(a) BackgroundAll housing in Land North Rhine-West-phalia is subject to the approval of theMinister of Reconstruction who has appointed an existing body known as the ruhr Regional Planning Authority to actin this matter on his behalf in the Ruhrarea. This body has appointed a specialistto deal with miners&apos; housing. The minemanagements themselves carry out repairs to houses which they own, and they alsocarry out new construction on their ownland all subject to the direction andcontrol of the North German Coal Control.(&amp;) recommendations the prospective redistribution of thefunctions of the North German CoalControl between the United States-UnitedKingdom Control Group and the german coal Management will call for consequen-tial adjustments in present arrangements.We recommend that these adjustmentsshould be worked out by the United States-United Kingdom Control Group in consul-tation with the German Coal management and the competent Land authorities in sucha way as to ensure that the programmingof housing needs for miners and the pro-vision and sub-allocation of materials tomeet these needs are carried out in themanner best calculated to implement thetwo-year programme referred to above.We feel, however, that in any arrange-ment that may be made, recognition shouldbe given to the special competence of theGerman Coal Management in this field andthe consequent need to invest them with thenecessary authority.3. Financingi&apos;(o) BackgroundUntil quite recently the repair pro-gramme for miners&apos; housing has beenfinanced through  the mining  industry,which has received grants out of centralrevenues to cover its general financialdeficiency in the working of the coal indus-try. This arrangement has now been reviewed and has been considered inequit-able on financial grounds. At the moment,therefore, further expenditure on this basis is not being sanctioned.(b) recommendation the two delegations recommend that thepresent financial limitations on the pro-vision of funds for the repair of mine-owned houses or the erection of new houseson mine-owned properties should beremoved and adequate funds should beprovided to enable the programme to becarried out both on mine-owned propertyor elsewhere, in a manner satisfactory tothe German Coal Management.4. Priorities(a) BackgroundWithin the limited resources of buildingmaterial available for housing, miners&apos;housing is being given priority in that60 per cent, of the total building materialsavailable in the British Zone for housingpurposes is being concentrated on the needsof the miners.(b) RecommendationWhile the priorities in regard to thesupply of building materials for miners&apos;housing appear to be satisfactory atpresent, with the possible exception of the items mentioned for investigation under1 (b) (4) above, the two delegations recom-mend the continuation of these priorities and their effective implementation through-out the two-year period of the programme.Appendix &quot; A &quot;Two-Year Programme of Miners&apos; HousingDwelling UnitsProvidedFirst Year: April 1947-March 1948-Repair to damaged houses      69,460New construction ...      ...        8,930Pre-fabricated construction      15,00093,39012,900258 hostels for single minersSecond Year: April l$4 r-March 1949-Repair to damaged houses      64,340New construction ...      ...      13,481Pre-fabricated construction      45,000122,821264 hostels for single miners      13,200
MINE SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT: REPORT OF WORKING PARTYPart I. Mine Supplies and equipment. A working party was established on12th August with the following terms ofreference    *(a) To examine and report on the urgent rquirements of the coal mines andclosely related industries for imported equipment and to set out these requirements in order of priority.(6) To estimate the cost of such imports,(c) To report the possible sources of sup-ply and delivery dates.2. The working party met on 13thAugust to consider steel requirements, andpresents this report: &apos;3. The working party confirmed theattached schedule of rolled steel for import and delivery over the next six months. Inaddition to the total of 120,210 tons shown on the schedule, there will be an item of10,000 tons over the period for galvanisedsteel sheets for miners&apos; housing.4. These imports are agreed on a quanti-tative basis only, and the agreement is sub-ject to further negotiation on prices of &quot;steelsupplies and transport.5. It is proposed that the bulk of the deliveries should be met at the beginningof the period, and that, if possible, 40,000tons should be delivered during the firsmonth.6. It is proposed that a total quantity of701,170 tons of steel products should bemade available to the German mines and railways during the period from indigenoussources and imports. This total will bereached as follows : 420,960 tons normal allocation to the]railroads and mines.150,000 tons from indigenous sourcesunder the special plan agreed inGermany.120,210 tons from imports according tothe attached schedule.10,000 tons from imports of galvanisedsteel sheets.D.

Part II. Mining Supplies Requirements1. BackgroundIn March 1947 coal production wasrising steadily and it seemed possible thata production of 300,000 tons per day ofIgross clean coal could be reached by theend of 1947.This was reinforced by the GermanMines Production Committees, who hadforecast 292,193 tons per day by September1947, provided that certain stipulateditems of mining supplies were provided.The German economy has not been ableto meet the stipulated requirements to thefull and this, together with the shortageof food&apos; and other conditions, hamperedproduction.2. Acceleration of programme in planning to raise production to300,000 tons per day in the first quarter of1948, lists of items which cannot beobtained at present from the german economy have been compiled, in order of priority by the German Mining SuppliesOrganisation. These lists have been examined in Washington by a jointUnited States-United Kingdom working party, who have made the following recommendations: 1 million $(a) The immediate import of 2(c) Electrical lamps and equipment... 2-62 (d) Conveyor belting and hose       ... 1-42 (f) Mine shaft timber ...      ...      ... 4-02(h) Compressor equipment ... 0-82 (m) Rust-proof varnishes     ...      ... 1-09-8(b) Procurement from army surpluses of--2(a) Mine workers&apos; clothing and foot-     &apos;wear        ...      ...      ...      ...    &apos;8-02 (1) Lorries or trucks   ......      ...      4-512-5(c) Further examination of 2(j) Chemicals   ...      .........      0-22 (k) Anti-friction bearings     ...      ...      3-02 (p) aluminium ...      ...      ...      ...      0-23-4(d) Procurement from resources in Ger-many of 2(e) Pitwood      ............. 5-32 (g) Lubricants and greases   ...      ... 1-22 (i) Copper        ............ 0-52 (o) Lead and tin        ...      ...      ... 0-32 (q) Cotton       ............ 0-98-2Details of the supplies demanded by theGerman Supplies Organisation and the) Working Party&apos;s observations on these areat Appendix &quot;A.&quot;3.

We have considered the four lists of requirements submitted by the GermanSupplies Organisation through the NorthGerman Coal Control. The lists are inorder of priority and are attached asAnnexes 1 to 4. The first two lists cover the most urgent needs over the next sixmonths.2. We have considered the first two listsunder their main categories and have toreport as follows : (a) Mine workers&apos; clothing and footwearestimated at 8 million dollars. Itappears that these needs can be met out of army surpluses and it is recommended that they be madeavailable forthwith.(b) Rolled steel requirements estimatedat 15 million dollars. These havebeen dealt with in the report of our first meeting on 13th August.(c) Miners&apos; electrical lamps, and equip-ment estimated at 2-6 million dollars. These were previously madeto a large extent in the Soviet zone of Germany and they have alwaysbeen in very short supply in the combined area.   It is recommended
that details of availability of thelamps and equipment in the UnitedStates^ United Kingdom and else-where be determined and that they be procured.(d) Rubber conveyor belting and pneu-matic hose estimated at 1 - 4 million dollars. We make a similar recom-mendation to that in 2 (c) above.(e) Pitwood estimated at 5-3 million dollars. There is ample pitwood inGermany but great difficulty in moving it. There are also difficultiesin obtaining it from the French and soviet Zones where it has to be pro-cured by a process of barter. Theproblem should, however, be capableof solution within Germany and wecannot recommend its import from outside.(/) Mine-shaft guide timber estimatedat 4-0 million dollars. There aretwo kinds of timber required, pitch-pine and jarrah. The figure quotedappears high, but we are unableto examine it in detail here. Theoperation of mine hoisting equip-ment in deep shafts at high speedsdemands a special type of high quality timber for cage guides. any failure of these guide timbers duringthe hoisting cycle is apt to result in serious production losses. It is,therefore, customary practice bothin the United States and abroad tocarry sufficient quantities of sparetimbers on hand for immediatereplacement when needed. Sincethe Ruhr mines are all deep shafts,and normal sources of supply were probably lacking for the past several years, We, the working party,recommends the import of the requirement, subject to bipartiteagreement in Germany as to thedetails of the quantities required.(g) Lubricants and greases estimated at - 2 million dollars. We do not recommend this import withoutfurther examination of availabilityin Germany. We understand thatthe refining of imported crude oilhas commenced at Hamburg andthat this is likely to produce a surplus of oils and.greases.(Ji) Electrical compressor equipmentestimated at 0-8 million dollars.There is a grave deficiency of com-pressor equipment, and we recom-mend the import subject to an examination of availability in theUnited States and United Kingdom.(*&quot;) Copper estimated at 0-5 million dollars. This should be obtainedfrom the Hamburg refinery whichhas now been started up.. (j) Chemicals estimated at 0-2 million dollars. We recommend a further examination of the possibility of^obtaining these chemicals in Ger-many. If, however, they cannot beobtained there we recommend theirimport.(k) Anti-friction bearings estimated at million dollars. The supply ofthese is of the greatest importanceto the mining industry. An expertexamination is now in progress inGermany to determine the pos- :sibility of indigenous supply andshould shortly be completed. If thisshould show that they cannot beobtained in Germany, we recom-mend import.(t) Lorries estimated at 4-5 million dollars. The United States have a working group in Washingtonexamining the possibility of supply from army surplus sources.(m) Rust proof varnishes estimated at million dollars. These cannot beproduced in Germany to-day, andwe recommend their import subject- to examination as to sources ofsupply.(n) Mica, asbestos and tyres and tubesii estimated at 1-1 million dollars. Weunderstand that arrangements forthe import of these have alreadybeen made.(o) Lead and tin estimated at 0-3 million dollars. These are believed&apos; to be available from German sourcesif their supply to the mines is givenadequate priority.(p) Aluminium estimated at 0 - 2 million dollars. The manufacture of alu-minium is prohibited in Germany.If this prohibition is to be main-tained, then we recommend theimport, but we consider the quantityshould be reviewed as it appears tobe high.(q) American cotton for technical pur-poses estimated at 0-9 million dollars. We recommend that this be allocated from recent imports.3. The requirements scheduled in thethird and fourth lists are not in such Iurgent needs as those in the first two, andwe recommend that they receive further study in Germany in the light ofindigenous and other sources of supply.

1. It is the unanimous judgment of thosedirectly responsible for coal productionhat the first essential toward increasingutput is certainly that the present officialration will be met regularly, punctuallynd without necessity for undue searchesand long journeys by housewives.-1: When the above has been achieved and existing stocks, together with other assuredvailabilities, are adequate, and only then,n increase in the basic ration should bemade.  It should be the aim, in accordancewith the Bizonal Agreement, to reach 1,800alories as the normal consumer ration,throughout the bizonal area, as soon as theworld    food    situation    and    assuredndigenous and imported supplies permit.3. Consideration should be given to making increases first by a supplementalration in large cities for the reason that supplies of off-the-ration foods are knownto be 50 to 100 calories less in such citiesthan elsewhere. If this is to be done, it is recommended that the Ruhr-Aachen areabe treated for this purpose upon the same basis as the large cities because the close proximity of so many small towns to eachother is such that the conditions of off-the-ration food is comparable to that of a largecity.4. Though it is generally accepted thatany specific priority for the Ruhr-Aachenregion is to be avoided because of its effecton other areas, it is, nevertheless, the viewof this working party that, as the maximumoutput of coal is a first essential for thewell-being of the whole bizonal area andfor the German economy in general, steps should be taken as to the location and usageof the special reserve stocks, which it islater herein recommended be set up, as willbe calculated to avoid a breakdown ordiminution in the ration in these districts.This is proposed because such breakdownshave happened in the past in the Ruhr in greater degree than in other areas.5. Since the food problem is the mostimportant single matter affecting coal production, it is necessary in this reportto deal with the food programme forbizonal Germany as a, whole as the only means of bringing about improved condi-tions in the Ruhr.6. To assure -the feeding of the ration,it is recommended that maximum purchases of cereals and other foods of kinds which do not deteriorate be made as rapidly aspossible, be shipped to Germany and ware-housed as reserve stocks; that such reservestocks be in addition to, and be keptseparate from, the normal stocks which are subject to distribution by the Germanbizonal authorities, and that such specialreserves be held in such manner that theycannot be released without the consentof the United States-United kingdom authorities, and finally that such specialreserves be located at key points especially the Ruhr-Aachen area as experience has indicated particular difficulty in maintain-ing the ration there. The reasons for placing these special reserves under suchUnited States-United Kingdom control are :; (a) To prevent dispersal.(b) To ensure equality of release withinthe area of need.(c) To prevent inclusion of these reserves in published figures of stocks avail-able for distribution, in orderthereby to avoid encouragingfarmers to be slack in deliveringtheir own home-grown products.To assure a regular food supply to the ruhr, all practicable transportation facili-ties should be utilised for the movement offood into this area. If a reasonable basiscan be worked out for use of the Rhineports, as later discussed in this report, the transportation problems in delivery of food supplies to the Ruhr will be materiallyalleviated.7. Procurement. Grain availibilitiesfor export from the United States havebeen progressively diminishing, and thesituation has deteriorated significantlyeven since this conference commenced.This necessitates special measures even to assure maintenance of the present ration.Estimates are that per capita amounts of indigenous food will be approximatelythose of last year. On this basis, importedfoods with an aggregate calorie contentapproximately equal to 4 million long tonsof wheat would be needed to maintain the1,550-calorie ration, and 800,000 tons more would be needed if the ration were to beincreased soon to 1,800 calories. Of this increase, 700,000 tons would be for con-sumption and 100,000 for increased stockneeded to support the higher ration.Secretary Anderson promised theGermans 3,600,000 tons of cereals from theUnited States. U.S.D.A.&apos;s working inter-pretation of this is that it referred toproduct weight, not wheat equivalent. Nolarger supplies from the United States canunder present conditions be relied upon.This tonnage, together with amounts ofother foods with a calorie content equal to food: REPORT OF WORKING PARTY
400,000 tons of wheat, would be sufficient tomaintain the 1,550-calorie ration. Appen-dix A illustrates how this might be made up.However, there is need for a higherration. Real restoration of productivecapacity in Germany would be fosteredthereby, and probably depends on it. the ration should be increased to 1,800 caloriesif necessary by stages, as soon as possibleboth for the health of the population andfor productivity. Procurement policy should, therefore, be based upon require-ments for this target so far as supplies areavailable, and maximum quantities offoods other than cereals should be purchased as a substitute for cereals onaccount of the shortage of the latter.Argentine corn so far as available shouldalso be used to supplement grains from theUnited States. Appendix &quot; B &quot; illustrateshow such a target might be met.However, it must be recognised thatvarious of these targets cannot be met infull. Yet, unless affirmative steps are taken at this time any significant increase in the ration will be jeopardised, and even themaintenance of the 1,550-calorie rationcannot be regarded as certain.To accomplish purchases on any scalessuch as above discussed, three principalchanges in methods appear necessary : (a) Funds, must be made available topurchase all useful foods adaptablefor mass relief feeding which areobtainable at reasonable prices.Since there is not enough grain, andalso since a better balanced diet is. necessary both for health and indus-trial productivity, an adequate supply programme must involve thepurchase of foods other than cerealswithout rigid limitation to thewheat or flour calorie equivalentprice. Judgment must be exercised in each case, with consideration ofall factors including obtaining thetotal food supplies necessary, ratherthan by the application of rigidprice formulae previously used.(b) Allocation of funds and responsi-bility would have to be made for pro-procurement to be directed from theUnited States of such foods otherthan cereals within general state-ments of theatre requirements of thevarious kinds of items. The pro-cedure should be such as to obviatethe necessity for obtaining specificconsent from the two MilitaryGovernments for separate pur-chases.   Such freedom has existedas to grains and flour because theywere bought through U.S.D.A.under allocation. So long as cerealsconstituted the principal part of theimports, existing limitations in pro-procurement authority for other foodwere less serious, but they wouldbecome impossible under any profgramme to acquire the very largeamounts now needed. U.S.D.A.,would, therefore, need authority tomake such purchases, and wouldhave to be in a position to takeinstant advantage of bargain pricesoffered. For this&quot; it would have tohave fairly broad discretionaryauthority. Since all purchaseswould be immediately reported, any changes in policy could be made as required, and this should furnishadequate controls.(c) Maximum procurement of foods inEurope. To this end: funds shouldbe allocated to the bizonal authori-ties in Germany; a food procure-ment organisation should be set up within the J.E.I.A., if one doeshot already exist; and maximumpurchases should be made withoutrigid limitation to the present policyof..a calorie cost ceiling equivalentto that of flour. This programme; would include purchases, on a par-tially deferred basis, as far as these can be arranged, of vegetables fromthe Low Countries, fish from Scan-dinavia, &amp;c. It should maximisepurchases which can be made forsterling, but it is considered essen-tial that it should also be preparedto offer dollars where necessary toget the food. U.S.D.A. has expressedthe opinion that a large tonnageof potatoes may be procurablefrom Czechoslovakia and Poland.Because of recent reports of damage to the German potato crop throughdrought, this becomes especially important. A procurement target of foods with calorie equivalent of400,000 tons of wheat might be setinitially for such European pur-chases. Details of this plan would,of course, have to be worked outlater.8. Reports made to the conference as tothe British experience last winter indicatethat there was for a time almost a 50 percent, falling off in their zone in Germanicollections, as compared with quotas whichthe Germans had themselves agreed upon,after    the    bizonal    agreement    was
I announced; further, that there was con-! vincing evidence that this was attributable to a belief on the part of the Germans thatthey could rely upon the Americans for large quantities of food, and that their own efforts could be relaxed. Two hundred thousand tons of collections were, the[British report, lost in this way.&quot;Whether or not the programme aboverecommended for procurement and stock-piling in Germany is announced, informa-tion as to it, and particularly as to thestockpiling, will certainly become known.British food authorities express concernover the maintenance of collections from theGermans under these conditions. On this account it is imperative to insure by every means that the maximum available tonnageof indigenous grains be delivered by farmers. To this end, it is recommendedthat the theatre commanders should adoptthe following measures to accomplishthis : (a) Penalties for evasion, with strictenforcement of them, and with further enactments if necessary tomake these effective.(b) Development    of    an    inspectionsystem to be conducted so far aspossible by the Germans but undertop-level supervision by UnitedStates and United kingdom authorities.(c) Adequate publicity concerning theresults of collections in each land and area, and also as to the penaltysystems and the inspections. ,(d) Through making it known that theamounts of imported food have been calculated upon the assumption thatthe Germans would comply fully with the collection quotas, and thatthe world supply situation is such that imported foods cannot beincreased if the Germans fail.9. Transportation of food supplies. One important cause of interruption in food supplies to the Ruhr over the pasteight months has been due to transporta-tion problems in Germany. This is because too much of the food has had tomove by rail from North German ports.To improve the flow of such supplies tothe Ruhr and elsewhere in the Land NorthRhine-Westphalia area, consideration should be given to use of Rotterdam andAntwerp as entry ports, as was done pre-war. The advantages of this are a shortersea voyage, better discharge facilities, shortinland water transport, relief of railways,ample barge tonnage and additional tugpower. By returning in this way to normal trade usage, the renewal of &quot; out and home &quot; barge traffic will be increased, andthe transport of outward coal also facili-tated. If the pending negotiations for useof Rhine ports above referred to can bebrought to a successful conclusion, animportant step in assuring regular food supply to the Ruhr will have been taken.(Signed)J.
