annex the United Kingdom arid Mp.PRhp.ll Aid(Notes for the guidance.of Sir Oliver Pranksprepared by the London Committee on european economic Co-operation)It will be impossible for Sir &quot;Oliver Franks to avoid giving at least an informal answer to the question.   Does theUnited Kingdom require Marshall aid.from the United States?If so,  in what form and at what date?     The following questionscalling for consideration by Ministers arise in this connection.Do we need American assistance?The position of the United Kingdom is a very difficult one.     The policies upon which we- are now entering are designedto enable us to balance our payments with the outside world.We calculate that if we can sell sufficient of the goods we aremaking available for export at the cost very largely of our own home consuming public - we shall be able very nearly to bringabout an overall balance of our trade by the middle of next year.But owing to the inconvertibility of other currencies. this will still leave us with a very serious dollar shortage.This arises from the fact that a large proportion ofthe foodstuffs and raw materials that we require must come fromthe Western Hemisphere, while we cannot sell&apos; a sufficientproportion of our goods in dollar markets to bring about adollar balance.      This situation has always existed, but beforethe war we earned dollars by our surpluses with other countries.To-day the world shortage of dollars&quot;is such that thesesurpluses are not convertible into dollars.     It is this thatmakes it impossible for us to balance our dollar payments eventhough we obtain an overall balance of payments.This must mean that some time - probably early - nextyear we shall in the absence of aid have still further to cutoff the purchase of foodstuffs,  tobacco, films and raw materials from the Western Hemisphere.     Alternative supplies will probably not be,obtainable elsewhere, and substitute foods will not be .available.     We shall therefore have to go without and ouralready low standards will perforce be further reduced,  and thisnot because we cannot produce enough in the United Kingdom topay for the supplies we need but because we cannot sell our goodsin the market from which our supplies alone can come./Whatever we do to maximise our production and so our exports,even if we greatly exceed our target,,, we shall be met by thissame, for us,  insuperable difficulty/.Such a- situation may well lead to a progressivefrustration of our efforts to get ourselves back on to our feet.Our productive power will be reduced, first by lack of foodstuffs to nourish our people,  second by non-availability of rawmaterials. 1This is the situation which Mr. Marshall foresaw, andto meet which the Marshall plan was designed.     We are now beginning a series of bilateral negotiations designed to secureour supplies at the minimum cost to our reserves.     As thesituation becomes more acute, further cuts are made    in our imports,  and our geld and dollar reserves dwindle,  these efforts to secure our supplies are certain to lead  to a. further
distortion of the world economic structure and a breakdown of even that part of multilateral trading which still survives.The sort of multilateral world, which we and the- Americans havebeen seeking to achieve since the end of the war would be postponed for an indefinite period.We are setting out to develop our colonial andComtnoOTeclth resources but this must be a lon^ term matter.In time we can expect to develop&apos; sources of supply within theEmpire of goods we must now buy for dollars,  so that somerelief from the problem of the dollar deficit in the futurecan be expected.-    Equally our own Agricul turcl programme willin time save us dollars.      But none of these will relieve theImmediate dollar problem.Zlt is,  therefore, impossible for us alone or with europe or with our Commonwealth and Empire to solve the problem which now faces the world.      If it is not solved we in common with all other countries that are bound to purchase goods fordollars will suffer&apos;beecuse we cannot sell a sufficiency ofour goods in dollar markets/7.The answer then must clearly be that we need assistancefrom the United States, and we need that assistance in 191+8if not sooner.It is clear that our willingness to accept Americanaid must depend on the form in which it may be given, and theconditions that may be attached to it.      It is not profitableat this time to list the conditions that would be entirelyunacceptable, nor the conditions that would be completelysatisfactory.      Our need,  however,  is such that it would bedifficult to refuse aid unless the conditions were politicallyintolerable or involved commitments which we could not fulfil.Should we seek, aid under the Marshall offer, or otherwise?The majority of the Committee felt that all theevidence suggested that there would be no further aid to anyoneexcept within the ambit of &quot;Marshall Aid&quot;.      That aid would begiven to each country as a result of bilateral negotiations,but those bilateral negotiations would be part of a generalplan.      It was,  however,  suggested from one quarter that theUnited Kingdom might do better to re-open the Loan- Agreement.The Americans were conscious that they had there made mistakes,both in giving too little, and imposing too rigid and rapida timetable.      We might be able to pet more through a re-negotiated loan than in any other way.      The majority feltthat such an approach would prejudice the. prospects of obtaining a sift or grant-iri-aid rather than a loan,  should not in anycase be mentioned until the additional SL(O0 million had been released,  and would probably expose us to more severe conditionsthan aid negotiated as part of a general Marshall Aid plan.Does the United Kingdom want &quot;Winter-Help11 ?The immediate needs of France, Italy and Austria are so pressing that the Administration will be under great pressure to take separate action for those countries.      If it calls aspecial session of Congress for that purpose there is a great danger that the sense of urgency of the rest of Europe&apos;s needsmay &quot;disappear, and no positive&apos;action be taken until the Spring.By that time our negotiating position will be very much weaker.
Our reserves will have declined.      We hove therefore a majorinterest in securing that the extremely urgent needs of a fewshould be used to reinforce the general urgency of Europe&apos;sneed and not detract from it.     We should use our best endeavours to have the- date of Marshall Aid accelerated to the utmost andthus meet,the French,  Italian and Austrion needs as part of thegeneral plan rather than separately.Should this not prove possible we are in a dilemma.The American Administration knows our reserves position and therate at which we expect to run them down..   We cannot claim tobe in as parlous a plight as some and if we did make the claimwe should lose sympathy thereby.      Unless therefore it appearsthat there will be no Marshall Aid and that Winter-Help is allthat the Americans are going, to do for the next nine-or twelvemonths we should not seek a share.      If however Winter-Help is tobe the maximum American contribution then we should seek a shareof. it on the grounds that we are among the major sufferers from &apos;the world dollar shortage.Should the United Kingdom offer any contribution?At an earlier stage it was suggested that the UnitedKingdom should make sane positive contribution in the form of   .gifts of raw materials such as wool or rubber.      Such action would perhaps gain us a favoured &quot;position among^the receiversof American aid.There are many reasons why this suggestion should not now .be pursued.     We are most anxious that Marshall aid should begiven in dollars and not in goods.      To offer commoditiesourselves would encourage dangerous ideas which are already in circulation.     Moreover we do not ourselves produce any ofthese raw materials.     We should have to buy them from theDominions or Colonies.     This would either increase the dominion and Colonies sterling balance or increase our needs for Americanaid.hth, October, 19h7.
