CABINETLAW.REFORM (PERSONAL INJURIES)  BILL ,Memorandum bv the Lord Chancellor^&apos;1&quot; At their meeting on the 21st May, 19I1.7 (S.S.(h7) 3rdMeeting) the. Social Services Committee invited me to arrangefor the preparation of a draft Bill to give ,effect to thedecisions,.of the Committee on the recommendations containedin the Report of the Monckton Committee on AlternativeRemedies (Cmd. 6860).2. The two remedies in question are -(i) The. common law action by an injured person againstthe person responsible in law for the injuryj  and(ii) The benefits which, as a result of the injury,, the^injured person will receive under the national insurance Acts. &apos;The problem is to know to what extent the remedy under (i)should be affected by benefits received under (ii).     no provision&apos;onxthis subject is made by the National insurance acts, but- when the Industrial Injuries Bill was beforeParliament,  it was stated, that the matter would require tobe dealt.with before the Insurance Acts were-brought into ;operation.-3. The conclusions reached by the Social services committee (S.S. (1+7) 1st Meeting and S.S. (I4.7) 3rd Meeting) wercthat --(i) The common, law action for damages should be-retained9 including the right of action byworkmen against their employers;(ii) The doctrine of common employment should.be abolished; &quot;(iii) The responsibility of an employer in respect ofa breach of statutory obligation under the-Factories Acts or similar legislation shouldbe modified to enable&apos;him to plead by way of-   defence that it was not reasonably practicable to avoid or prevent the breach;(iv) In an action for damages for personal injury,whether arising between, employer and workman &quot;orotherwise,  the court should take into account,(THIS D.OCIMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)I - SEC RET&apos;CP.

in assessing the damages representingcompensation for loss of earnings or profits,one half of r.ny national insurance benefits which the injured man would receive during theperiod of five years from the elate of the&quot;accidents  but that no account should be taken of constant attendance allowances or deathbenefits^(v) In cases where national insurance benefit is payable, no attempt should be made to recoverfor the Exchequer the difference between the gross, damages end the damages payable afteraccount has been taken of national insurance benefit;(vi) The existing practice of awarding damages inone sum should be preserved.k* The Social Services Committee invited me to bring this matter before the Cabinet.      The above recommendations are substantially in accordance with the majority Report ofthe Monckton Committee,  except that that-Committee recommendedthat the whole (and not merely half) of any insurance benefits should be taken into account, without any time limit,, andthat account should also be taken of constant attendance allowance and death benefits.-The conclusions of the -Social Services Committee havebeen informally agreed to by the Trades Union..Congress.,5* I now circulate herewith a copy of &apos; the draft Bill   -which has been prepared t-o give effect to these recommendations.6* There is a further matter,  to which I must draw mycolleagues&apos; attention, which was not considered by the social services Committee.      The Monckton Committee recommended an alteration in the period of limitation within which an action for damages for per sen.&apos;: I injuries might be started.     Atpresent the periods are fixed by statute as follows: -(a) one year, for actions under the Fatal AccidentsActs and actions for breach of public duty brought under the Public Authorities Protection Act, which applies to the Crown and to all local authorities(Limitation Act, 1939);(b) three years, in all actions by or against- the coal board, Transport Commission or any of the newelectricity authorities (by special provision inthe respective statutes)i(c) six years,   in all other actions of contract- or tort(with longer periods in certain special cases whichare not material here)   (Limitation Act, 1939)*The Monckton Committee suggested that three years should be the.period in all actions for personal injuries.This is a matter which raises far-reaching caonsiderations and it may be thought well to have the problem carefully examined by an expert committee before legislction is introduced.But unless we are able either to    insert a provision in the bill or t-o say that the matter is being examined, we must- expect   ,criticism in Parliament,  both from the employers who would
benefit from any reduction of the period in which they ereliable to be sued end from those who consider thrt there isno longer any justification for the favoured position of theCrown and of local authorities under the-Public AuthoritiesProtection Act.7* I csk for approval of the policy contained in theBill and for authority to bring the Bill before the legislation committee.      I also ask for consideration of whether (a)    we&apos;accept the recommendation of the Monckton Committee and provide in the Bill for a three-year period of limitation in actions for.personal injuries, or (b)    it is better to say nothing inthe Bill and to appoint a committee to consider the whole matter of limitation of actions with c view to dealing with itseparately at a later date.JoHouse of Lords,  S.W.  1.,20th October, 19kl.
