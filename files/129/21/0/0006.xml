DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1947SECRET31CP. (47) 256Qth September, 1947CABINETREPORT ON THE FIFTH SESSION OF THE ECONOMIC and social COUNCIL ,HERE for the information of my colleagues is a report on the Fifth Sessionof the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.Report on the Fifth Session of the Economic and Social Council,New York, 19th July to 17th August, 1947The Fifth Session of the Economic and Social Council was the most business-like so far. In the absence of Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar (India), Mr. J. Papanek(Czechoslovakia) made an efficient President. The Secretariat showed improve-ment. The Council on this occasion refused to waste time on trivial matters and an agenda of 39 items was dealt with expeditiously. The results were,for the most part, satisfactory from the United Kingdom, point of view.2. Most of the agenda consisted of routine matters. The following are some items of greater importance : Regional Economic CommissionsThe report of the Economic Committee for Europe was adopted, theRussians making secondary procedural difficulties but failing to make the expected campaign against the Truman doctrine and the Marshall Plan.The Council approved a programme of work planned by the Economic Corn-mission for Asia and the Far East and determined the membership and geographical scope of the Commission. A considerable debate took placeon a proposal for the setting up of an Economic Commission for latin america, several delegations giving warning that the Council should notmove too far from the original functional conception of its activities towhat might become regional autarky. The Council eventually decided toset up an ad hoc committee to consider the factors bearing upon the establish-ment of a Commission for Latin America., ................International Trade organisation the Council agreed that non-members of the United Nations, includingBurma, Ceylon and Southern Rhodesia, should be invited to the World TradeConference but, contrary to our views, decided that they should not havethe right to vote. Whether this subject should be raised again at the general assembly will depend upon current discussions with the Governments of theUnited States and Canada, who were strongly opposed to the United Kingdompoint of view.Memorandum by the Minister of StateH. McN.Foreign Office, 6th September, 1947ANNEX&apos;14307   [34220]
The Indian delegate led a successful campaign to send a direct invitation to Indonesia to attend the World Trade Conference...................................Specialised Agencies- Agreements were concluded establishing formal relationship under theUnited Nations Charter with five specialised agencies, including the bank and the Fund. Discussions revealed differences of opinion on the extent towhich the United Nations should exercise central authority, over the specialised agencies; some delegations tended towards a more centralised viewthan that to which His Majesty&apos;s Government would subscribe.World Federation of Trade Unions..........The World Federation of Trade Unions again pressed on the Councilextravagant demands for a status which would be equal to that of the specialised agencies and would, in some respects, have been better thanthat of members of the United Nations not members of the Economic and social Council.  The Council rejected these claims.Freedom of information the Council decided that the Conference called by the Assembly shouldbe held at Geneva beginning March 1948.oil the Council adopted a United Kingdom motion providing that no action should be taken at present on the International Co-operative AllianceResolution which would have placed oil resources, starting with the middle east, under international administration.DelegationsIn general, the views of the Canadian, United States and UnitedKingdom delegations coincided and the attitude of these three delegationsin agreement was for the most part decisive. The Russians raised manyprocedural difficulties but were apparently under instructions not to takea notably aggressive part. The Indian delegate, Mr. R. K. Nehru, was very active and, except on issues concerning dependent peoples, where he wasextreme, made a useful contribution.General Comment. In contrast to previous practice, the Council made a careful study of its work for the forthcoming year and took useful steps to regulate the volumeof work in relation to priorities. Among other things, it decided only tomeet twice instead of three times a year. Altogether, although the FifthSession did nothing spectacular, there was much favourable comment on the determination of its members, displayed corporately for the first time, to substitute workmanlike methods for dramatic debate.
