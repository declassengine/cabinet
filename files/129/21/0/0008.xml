)annex government BULK PURCHASES OF FOOD-STUFFSMemorandum by the Minister of food at the meeting of the Cabinet on 19th August the Prime Minister under-took to ascertain my views on the points raised in the discussion on Governmentbulk purchases (CM. (47) 72nd Conclusions, Item 3). I am submitting thismemorandum at the Prime Minister&apos;s invitation.2.   In the discussion on Government bulk purchases it was suggested that (a) &quot; it would be advantageous if a somewhat larger proportion of the food-stuffs of the United Kingdom could be bought through the normal channels of trade &quot;;(&amp;) &quot; while so much of our total needs were covered by Government bulkpurchases there were risks of political pressure from foreign Govern-ments &quot;; and(c) &quot; it was worth considering whether there would be long-term advan-tages .... in encouraging the reopening of the futures markets incertain commodities by seeking to obtain a proportion, say 30-40 percent, of our requirements of those commodities through commercialbuying.&quot;3.   In the following paragraphs I comment on each of these points.4. The advantage envisaged from buying a larger proportion of our food supplies through normal trade channels presumably is that we should obtain our supplies at lower prices. I do not think that this would be the case in presentconditions of world shortage. On the contrary I hold firmly to the views which i expressed in the House of Commons on 1st July, when I said v &apos;&apos; All this shows, I submit to the Committee, that to-day bulk buyingis an absolutely indispensable means, using the instrument of the long-term contract, for mobilising the buying and consuming power of this greatmarket to obtain the maximum quantities of food at the most reasonable prices.&quot;I added that the negotiations of actual purchasing agreements was carried outby my Commodity Directors, all of whom had had long experience in their trades and who were recognised internationally as leading experts. To leave the tradefree to compete against my buyers in world markets for a proportion of UnitedKingdom requirements could only raise prices against us in present conditionsof scarcity. Accordingly, I propose that no change should be made in our existing methods of purchase until world supplies of basic food-stuffs become moreabundant. As supplies of particular food-stuffs become more plentiful I proposeto examine the buying methods for the individual food-stuffs commodity bycommodity, and to make proposals for changes if they appear to be desirable. Iwould add that present purchasing methods have the great advantage of ensuring that firm yet flexible control over our expenditure on imported food which is soessential in the present financial crisis.5. I do not believe that the risks of political pressure would necessarily bereduced by handing over part of our purchasing of imported food to normal tradechannels. Those Governments which will wish to exert undesirable political pressure upon us will frequently be Governments of countries which controltheir exports of food-stuffs. Thus they will exert that pressure just as muchagainst private British firms as against Government Departments. Moreoverin times when the Government is forced to determine precisely the amount and nature of pur imports of food we cannot escape responsibility xor our decisionssimply by hiding behind private trade. I do not deny that State purchasecarries risks of political pressure; I simply do not believe that we can reducesuch pressure by handing over part of our imports to the private trade.34224 B
6. A decision about the reopening of futures markets in such food-stuffs as wheat and sugar must await the appearance of more abundant world supplies. For purely technical reasons futures markets cannot operate without adequate world supplies. They certainly could not operate on the basis of 30-40per cent, of our import requirements. Accordingly I propose that a decision to reopen terminal markets should be taken when the purchasing methods for particular commodities come under examination (see paragraph 4 above). this does not mean that we should postpone our efforts to regain at least part of theinvisible earnings which the &quot;United Kingdom received for specialised services in commodities. Substantial progress has already been made for example for developing in London an entrepot trade in coffee. In addition my department is examining the possibility of re-establishing an entrepot trade in sugar underwhich we should import raw sugar and export refined sugar. Measures like theseare being taken and will continue to be taken.7. There appears to be some misunderstanding about the position of theso-called normal trade channels. The Ministry of Food is obliged to make thefullest use of trade channels in carrying out its import business. Indeed myMinistry could not possibly operate unless it did so. The main difference ascompared with pre-war practice is that the actual decision as to the volume ofimports and the prices to be paid are taken by the Ministry. Until such time as our balance of payments is restored to equilibrium I do not see how we can handback these vital decisions to private firms and individuals.8.   I recommend therefore,(a) that no change should be made.in our existing methods of purchasingimported food-stuffs;(b) that the position of each importing commodity should be examined asworld supplies become easier and decisions should be taken onpurchasing methods and futures markets in the light of the circum-stances of the particular commodity under review;(c) that the Ministry should continue to examine commodity by commodity,the means of regaining our invisible earnings from the commodityservices.J. S.Ministry of Food, S. W. 1,9th September 1947.ANNEX IIGOVERNMENT PURCHASES OF RAW MATERIALSMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn most cases shortage has been the main underlying reason for Governmentpurchase of raw materials. Where supplies have become adequate to permitpractically unrestricted consumption, reversion to private trade has been widelyadopted and is still being extended in appropriate circumstances and timing.Import licences can be used to secure balance of payments control to the extent that imports from hard currency sources can be prevented so long as adequatealternative sources are available. Total imports can therefore be watched. Thereis, however, no way of checking the implementation of import licences and closeprogramming is rendered difficult. Careful consideration must therefore begiven to reversion to private trade in each case as it arises. So long as it isGovernment policy to maintain or impose restrictions on end-uses, control overraw material is of first importance. But it must be emphasised that, in somecases (e.g., copper and zinc), the vast spread of the primary materials throughout industry and the numerous intermediate stages through which the metal and itsalloys may pass before it reaches the end-use, make it virtually impossible to restrict end-uses by control over the raw material.
2. As in the case of food, however, commercial channels are very widely usedin the purchase of raw materials by the Government. Government purchase isnot synonymous with bulk purchase; many raw materials are in fact bought in comparatively small lots and very large long-term contracts, either with otherGovernments or single foreign suppliers, are the exception rather than the rule.Nevertheless, it is very doubtful whether it would save in exceptional cases,where, for example, a small part of the supplies are of a specialised nature be of advantage to mix Government and private purchase of a single commodity.This would be unlikely to remove risk of political pressure, and it would probablygive us the worst of both worlds.Futures Markets3. The only important Board of Trade material still imported on Govern-ment account and of significance in this respect appears to be cotton, which will shortly become the responsibility of the Cotton Buying Commission. It has been recognised throughout that the establishment of permanent centralised purchasewould prevent the re-establishment of a cotton futures market in this country iAs regards materials for which the Ministry of Supply is responsible, themost important in this connection are copper, lead, zinc and tin; these are boughtand controlled by the Ministry which possesses a virtual monopoly in the UnitedKingdom. .,- -Commercial channels are used only for the purchase of small tonnages of metal from various sources when the actual producers are not represented inLondon by recognised agents; the vast bulk of the purchases are made eitherdirect from the producers or from their authorised agents.All four metals were, in pre-war days, dealt in on the London MetalExchange. The Government obtains no price advantage by the bulk purchaseof copper, lead and zinc, since the producers are not willing to concede any advantage. Failing the price-fixing mechanism of the Metal Exchange, theprice in the United States is used as the basis of all transactions. The dis-cussions between the Treasury and the Bank of England on the one hand andthe Committee of the &quot;London Metal Exchange on the other have shown that it isvery difficult to reconcile the operations of a &quot; free &quot; market with world-widecurrency restrictions.There is no supply reason why copper and zinc should not be allowed togo free world supplies are now sufficiently nearly in balance with demand toavoid spectacular fluctuations in price. It is possible that the Exchange could operate on a proportion of our total consumption since quite large tonnages (of copper at any rate) were contracted for before the war direct between consumerancl producer, but What the proportion would have to be in order to ensuresatisfactory working of the Exchange it is difficult to say. Opinion is practicallyunanimous that the Exchange could not function properly side by side with any scheme of rationed consumption, as in the case of lead.The case of tin is rather different from that of copper, lead and zinc, sincethe net flow of metal is from the Sterling Area towards the United States andthere is not the same currency reason against freeing the market. Tin, however,is still in short world supply and setting it free would probably mean a con-siderable rise in price. Though consumers in the United Kingdom would suffersomewhat by this, the net result should be an increase of dollar earnings. Thereare, however, serious political considerations against any price increase and thereis an international scheme of allocation which could not be worked if the marketwere free. These aspects of the tin problem are the subject of special considera-tion and a paper is now in process of being drafted by the interested departments for submission to Ministers.R S CBoard of Trade, S.W.1,9th September, 1947.APPENDIXNotes on Methods of Purchase of Imported Supplies of the Main RawMaterials, where either the Government and Private Trade operate in Parallel, or the Government Buys through the trade. The examples are not completely exhaustive but they cover all but a negligible part of the 1947-48 Raw Materials Import Programme.34224 b 2
/Board of trade . Most timber is purchased by the Board of Trade (Timber Control) fromthe English agents of foreign suppliers. There are, however, two types of case where there is private import under licence : (a) Timber for certain special end-uses involving specialised technique and knowledge, e.g., barrel staves, bobbin spools and pencil cedar.(b) Experimental timbers not hitherto used on a large scale.   These are notthe usually known types and private trade has been left to developsupplies in the hope that this will increase availabilities.These exceptions really amount to separate arrangements for different commodities-ties, so that competition between private and public buying is practically absent.Pulp3.   A distinction exists here between : (a) Pulp for paper making which is purchased direct by the Paper Controlthrough foreign suppliers&apos; agents.(6) Pulp for rayon, cellulose film and sundries, which is purchased privately.Pulp for rayon is not the same as pulp for paper, i.e., it is a higher grade product.Foreign countries can., however, vary their supplies of one as against the other and in fact are making more rayon pulp because it pays better. The rayon, pulptrade is very well defined and the product is used only by a handful of firms who work out a programme through their trade association.Paper and Board4. Paper, waste paper, rags, &amp;c, and kraft liner board are imported on private account. Building board really a distinct product is, however,purchased direct on public account and not through the United Kingdom trade.Cotton5.   All cotton is purchased on public account but the channels vary (a) United States and Indian cotton is purchased through offers from Liver-pool merchants representing United States and Indian shippers.(b) Brazilian and Egyptian cotton is purchased by the Control direct throughthe Controls representatives in these countries.(c) Colonial cotton is purchased direct by the Control under contracts madewith the Colonial Governments.The purchase of raw cotton will very shortly be taken over by the Cotton BuyingCommission. Cotton waste and linters are at present purchased on the same basis as cotton, though the sources are more limited; they are in short supply.Hides, Skins and Tanning Materials6. These do not constitute a homogenous single product, but are in factmany different things. Taking the group as a whole there is a three-folddistinction: (a) Cattle hides and goatskins and all but a very minor quantity of tanning Jmaterials are purchased by the Government through offers submitted jby the United Kingdom trade.(b) Tanned kips are purchased by the Government direct in India from the [Indian tanners and their agents. Burma hides are also bought direct Iat origin.(c) Sheepskins, other miscellaneous skins and leather (as such) are purchased entirely on private account.Silk7. Silk imports are on private account except from Japan. The special 1case of Japan is due to S.C.A.P.&apos;s insistence, as we should prefer private 1purchase.        .Chemicals8. It is difficult to speak of chemicals as a whole because they really!constitute a large number of separate commodities and because the definition!
of the group itself is flexible.   Taking them as a group, however, the positionis as follows : 1 aPyrites and phosphate rock are purchased direct by the Government.Molasses and ethyl alcohol are purchased by the Government using UnitedMolasses as agents; while acetone and butyl alcohol are purchased by theGovernment using British Industrial Solvents as agents.Caustic potash and sulphur (this latter being rather a peculiar case) arebought on Government account, though purchase is made through the UnitedKingdom trade.Butyl acetate is a case where there was recently a small purchase by theGovernment parallel with private purchase, but it was a most unsatisfactoryarrangement.All other chemicals and dyestuffs are purchased on private account throughimport licences.Jute9. Jute and jute goods are bought on Government account but throughthe trade in the sense that purchases are made from the United Kingdom agents of the Indian shippers. Both are in short supply. Recently a minor return to ordinary private import of jute goods has been approved for LCI. though itis not yet known whether LCI. will in fact operate on this basis.Hemp10.   All hemp is bought by Board of Trade (Hemp Control).   Sisal is atpresent obtained under a bulk arrangement with the B.E.A. Governments; for-other kinds, purchases are made through pre-war importers acting as agents.Ministry of SupplyNon-ferrous Metals11. Purchases are mainly from the producers direct, only small tonnagesbeing bought through commercial channels.   (See covering minute, paragraph 6.)Chrome Ore12. This is purchased on public account from merchants, producers and,where necessary, Government agencies. Direct contracts are entered into with large-scale producers, while purchases from merchants cover the output of smalleragencies. It is necessary to purchase from Government agencies where that isthe method insisted upon by the country concerned, e.g., Yugoslavia.Iron and Steel, &amp;c.13. Iron and steel, iron ore, scrap and ferro alloys are purchased in bulk by trade organisations (British Iron and Steel Corporation (Limited), B.LS.C. (Ore)(Limited)) controlled as to their operations by the Iron and Steel Board. the purchases are made direct from suppliers except where suppliers insist onoperating through an agent.
