As explained in that report, I have found it necessary in view of the urgency ofthe matter to address letters to the two sides of certain industries engaged in current wage negotiations.     My colleagues should be aware that the General Council of the Trades UnionCongress have already expressed alarm that these lettersshould have been sent in these circumstances,  and I think&quot; it probable that they will seek to press their views on theGovernment in the near future.      It is important that thedraft statement which the Working Party propose for discussionwith the National Joint Advisory Council should be considered as a matter of urgency. -G.A.I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W.&apos;1.,23rd September, 1947.
OFFICIAL WORKING PARTY ON THE STABILISATION OF WAGESINTERIM REPORT -Origin and functions of the Working Party(l) In the course of a debate in the House of commons on 6th August, I9h7,  the Prime Minister announced certaindecisions which the Government had reached on the means forovercoming the economic crisis.     In the course of his speech the Prime Minister said -&quot;I- appeal to workers in all industries andemployments not to press at this time for increases .of wages or changes in&apos; conditions which would havea similar effect, especially where increases are. put forward on the basis of maintaining differentialsbetween, various, categories of workers on the basis of .former practice. -   Equally I would appeal to employersnot to seek, to tempt workers away from essential work by offering higher inducements to work in less essential industries thus creating a vicious spiral&quot;(Hansard, 6th August, 19h7, Column I5H4.)..(2) The Working Party was set up in accordance with a minute circulated by the Secretary to the Cabinet on13&apos;th August, 19U7 (GEN.179/22) which contained the following paragraph -&quot;Stabilisation of- wagesThe Ministry of Labour will discuss with theTreasury, Board of Trade, Ministries of Supply,Fuel and Power, Works, Agriculture and the scottish office, what further steps can be taken with a viewto preventing increases in wage rates;    and in thelight of that discussion will prepare a report forconsideration by Ministers before discussions areopened with representatives of industry&quot;.It seemed desirable that certain other Departments shouldbe associated with the Working Party in their discussions;on the stabilisation of wages.      In addition,  therefore,  tothe Departments mentioned in the remit, the following. have   -been represented -Offices of the Cabinet (Economic Section), Officeof the Lord President of the Council, Central   -Economic Planning Staff, Ministry of Health and ministry of Transport. .(3) The Working Party took as its terms of reference&quot;To consider what further steps can be taken with a view to preventing increases in wages or changes in conditions whichhave a similar effect&quot; read in the context of the PrimeMinister&apos;s appeal. - .tgps (h) We are informed by the Ministry of Labour that anIready examination of the outstanding claims, showed that at thefeken, beginning of September there&apos; were several of considerable importance on which an early decision must be anticipated.
litThey included claims in six of the retail distributive trades,the wholesale grocery trade,  road haulage, boots and shoes,milk distribution,  inland waterways and quarrying.(5) Obviously it was essential to take special steps in regard to the more urgent of these claims and accordingly,in view of the short time available,  the Minister of Labouraddressed a letter on the lines of Annex A to the followingindustries -Retail drapery, furnishing, pharmacy, meat, food,hairdressing, milk distribution, road haulage andboots and shoes.(6) In addition in reply to a request from the building trade Employers for an assurance that despite the changes inthe economic position since 17th July,   the Government didnot -wish to alter the terms of a suggestion made to them onthat date on the basis of which negotiations&apos;were proceeding,both sides of the industry were informed that the suggestion was made as a basis for their further consideration of theproblem before them and that when they resumed their negotiations the Minister assumed they would recognise the altered circumstances with which they had to deal and wouldtake the Prime Minister&apos;s statement fully into consideration.(7) Only in the case of the Retail Drapery J.I.O. hasagreement been recorded.      This provides, for wage increases of about 10/- per week and a reduction of hours from 1+8 to(8) The Ministry of Labour have explained that actionof the kind  taken would not normally have been contemplated&apos; without first discussing the matter with the National joint advisory Council and that this consultation will need totake place at the earliest possible moment.     Moreover,  the disadvantages of proceeding industry by industry in this wayare that some industries may deal with a claim without theknowledge of the Government and that individual employers are not in any way directly approached.     For these reasons the Ministry of Labour feel  that a general statementsupplementing the Prime Minister&apos;s appeal should be issuedby the Government at the earliest opportunity in agreement,if possible,  with the  two sides of industry.(9) With these proposals the Working Party are fully in agreement and feel, moreover,  that the opportunity shouldbe  taken of announcing the steps the Government intends totake to discourage wage increases that might be contraryto the national interest.to     (10) The Working Party considered that  the fullesttaken     possible use should be made of subsidies, grants and    price-fixing arrangements under Government control to discourageundesirable wage increases.     Proposals on policy in regardto the price control aspect of this matter were contained inthe report by the Steering Committee (L.P.(47) 23).      TheWorking Party think that in the light of present conditionssome modifications in the direction of greater severity are desirable.      In so far as grants and subsidies are concerned,increases should not be given to meet increased costsarising from wage increases unless it is clearly not contraryto the national interest that such wage increases shouldtake place,  and the Working Party feel that a statement tothis effect would materially influence the course of
negotiations in industries receiving such subsidies orgrants, and particularly. influence the attitude of theemployers when considering claims involving increased-wages.      So far as prices under. Government control areconcerned, consideration should be given to the possibilityof refusing to make allowance even up to the limited extentpermitted in&apos; the past, for additional wage costs resultingfrom an increase in wages or change in conditions of-employment unless the same consideration of national interest applies.      It must be clearly recognised that thepolicy involves the Government being prepared -(a) to give definite guidance as to which wage increases or changes in conditions of employment are&quot;clearly not contrary to the national interest&quot;;    and(b) to refuse full or even in some cases any priceadjustments in eases where the changes might be contraryto the national interest even if they are told that thiswill involve the refusal of a wages claim.We recommend that the Government&apos;s intention to follow thispolicy should- be announced in general terms in the statementsuggested in paragraph 8 above and it must be&apos; clear that thepolicy would be applied by all price-controlling Departments.(11) Care must, however, be taken to avoid any suggestion that the Government are either ignoring the termsof the Pair Wages Resolution or intending to depart from it.That Resolution provides that the contractor must -&quot;pay rates of wages and observe hours andconditions of labour not less favourable thanthose established for the trade or industry inthe district where the work is carried out bymachinery of negotiation or arbitration to whichthe parties are organisations of employers or.trade unions representative respectively of substantial proportions of employers and workers engaged in the trade or industry in the district&quot;.This means that where an agreement is reached and becomesoperative there can be no attempt to disregard it in negotiating contract prices.     But this is a different matter from fixing controlled maximum prices or settling the amounts of Government grants or subsidies,  and withregard to these it appears to the Working Party that solong as all concerned have advance notice of the governments intention the question of observance of the Pair wages resolution should not arise.      The Ministry of Transportdissent from this in view of their special position vis-a-visHighway  uthori tics who act on the one&apos; hand as agents forthe Ministry in carrying out trunk road work and on theother hand receive grants from the Ministry towards workwhich they carry out for themselves on classified roads.(12) In recommending this action the Working Party feelthat the following weaknesses should be mentioned.     Ingeneral subsidies and grants are made to,  and price controlarrangements exist in,&apos; the more essential industries andthere is a very wide range of industry which cannot be influenced by these methods, and on the whole  these sectionsinclude the less essential activities.      Consequently,  ifthis policy is adopted it is most important &quot;to obtain theco-operation of those sections of industry which cannot beaffected by it in observing the same principles and in taking
steps to avoid undesirable wage increases.     As an immediatemeasure to achieve this latter objective the government statement which it is suggested should be made,  contains the positive suggestion that all claims formulated before6th August should be re-examined whatever the stage reached.     Secondly, the price control arrangements vary considerably from industry to industry,  end in many cases they cannot be made sufficiently close to prevent employersfrom recouping themselves to some extent in various ways,even if an increase in controlled prices is refused.     Itis desirable, nevertheless, for the price control arrange-ments to be reviewed in the light of this decision in theimmediate future.    . Thirdly, it must be recognised thatthere are bound to be cases in which it would not in fact be possible to ignore wage increases in fixing prices.For instance,  it would be quite impossible to commit theNational Coal Board or the National Transport Commissionto accepting the burden of future wage increases withoutrecouping themselves in higher prices and charges.     the suggested statement cannot be more than a generaldeclaration&apos;  of policy which may have to be modified inparticular cases,  but as such it should we think be valuable.(13) Undesirable wage movements in industry frequentlyresult from the action of individual employers who,  to gaina temporary advantage in labour recruitment, pay in excessof the agreed rates or vary the agreed conditions such ashours, holidays,  etc.     Many instances of this could be quoted and indeed in the reply by.the Employers&apos; Side ofthe National Joint Industrial Council&quot;&quot;for the RetailFurnishing etc. Trades to the Minister of Labour&apos;s letter(Annex A)  it was stated that the Employers&apos; Side feltcompelled to agree with the Trade Union Side that therewas very little relation between the rates- specified inthe existing agreement and the rates actually being paid.They added that,  &quot;on the whole, it seemed desirable to bringthe agreement more into line with existing conditions&quot;.Similar conditions, of course,  exist in other industries and arise from the inflationary pressure caused by the excessive demands of the community for all kinds of goods and services which make their production profitable whetherthey are essential ,or not.      In general,  in such conditions it is more profitable for employers to grant wage increasesthan to run the risk of a loss in numbers or in the averagequality of their labour.(Hi) While, therefore,  strict adherence to agreedrates is an important element in the problem of securingany measure of stability.of wages,  this is made more difficult by these conditions.      Moreover,  action that might simplyresult in the agreed published rates being obviously lower than the prevailing rates would react detrimentally on.organisation.      In the Wages Councils Trades machineryexists for enforcing minimum payments.      Only in the caseof the Building Industry has any attempt ever been made toestablish agreed rates as statutory maxima.     We have notattempted to consider whether any generally applicable,machinery could be devised for preventing payments inexcess of agreed rates,  but there must be some attempt tobring home to the individual employer his responsibilities in this regard.      We feel little doubt that organisedindustry will welcome some declaration on the   part of the
Government in favour of strict adherence to agreed ratesand we have included a reference to this in the statement. -(15) We recommend that this statement should bediscussed v/ith the National Joint Advisory Council and issued without delay.(16) As. regards the content of the statement,  we feel, with the exception of the representative of theBoard of Trade,  that it should be on the lines of thedraft annexed (Annex B).     The Board of Trade representativehas explained that the President may wish to suggest adraft on somewhat different lines and his position mustbe regarded as reserved.(I?)     ,     We would emphasise that we present this interimreport because of the need for immediate action in viewof the number of claims for wage increases underconsideration in industry.     We think the action we propose will reinforce the Prime Minister&apos;s appeal of6th August and bring the appeal directly to the notice ofboth sides of industry in an endeavour to secure that itis taken fully into account before any of the presentclaims are conceded or new. claims presented.(18) There can be no doubt of the advantages to be derived from an agreement wi th -t he two side.s.-of industry on this matter.      Such agreement would pave the way tofurther steps that might be possible with their continued co-operation.      In the circumstances, whilst we have considered a number of other measures, we have notpursued them until the &quot;reactions of the National joint advisory Council to the present proposal are known.     were/ould wish to revieY/ the- position in the light of these discussions.&apos;Summary of recommendations to sum. up,  the &quot;Working Party recommend as a first step - . .(l)    that in so far as Government grants and subsidies are concerned, increases should not be givento meet increased costs arising from additional wagecosts unless it is clearly not contrary to the national interest that such increases should take place.(2)    that as regards prices under Government control,consideration should be given to the possibility of refusing to make allowance even up to the limited extent-permitted in the past for additional wage costs unlessthe same consideration of national interest applies.(3)    that- the Trade Unions should be asked to reviewany v/age claims formulated before 6th August whether ornot an application has already been lodged and whatever  .the stage that any joint&apos;negotiation may already havereached.
(U)    that individual employers should be pressed to adhere strictly to agreed rates.(5)    that the draft statement in /,annex B based onthese recommendations should be discussed with theNational Joint Advisory Council at the earliest possible moment.(6)    that the problem of stabilisation of wages should be further considered by the Working Party whenthe reaction of the National Joint Advisory Council tothese proposals are known.Signed on behalf of the Working PartyR.M.  GOULD.Ministry of Labour and National Service,22nd September, 19U7.
Letter from Minister of Labour - 6th September,  19U7I understand that the Drapery Joint Industrial councils meeting on-Monday next, September 8th, to consider anapplication by the Trade Union side for an increase in wagesand a reduction in hours.In view of the serious economic position of thecountry at.the present time I feel that I must draw the attentionof both sides of the Council to the following statement made bythe Prime Minister in the House of Commons on August 6th:-&quot;I appeal to workers in all industries andemployments not to press at this time for increases ofwages or changes in conditions which would have.a similareffect, especially where these increases are put forward on the basis of maintaining differentials between various categories of workers on the basis of former practice.Equally,  1 would appeal to employers not to seek to temptworkers away .from essential work by offering higherinducements to work in less essential industries,  thuscreating a vicious spiral.&quot;I hope that in the discussion at your meeting onMonday you will keep.the Prime Minister&apos;s statement fully inmind.I have sent a similar letter to the Secretary of theTrade Union side.(Signed)    G.a.  ISAACS
ANNEX UB&quot;statement in his statement to the House of Commons on, 6th Augustlast the Prime Minister made the following appeal to the two &quot;sides of industry,  employers and workers:-&quot;I appeal to workers in all industries and. employments not to press at this time for increases ofwages or changes in conditions which would have a similareffect,  especially where these increases ore put forward on the basis of maintaining differentials between various categories of workers on the basis of former . practice.Equally,  I would appeal to employers not to seek to temptworkers away from essential industries,  thus creating avicious spiral.&quot;The Government have considered what additional guidancecan be given to the two sides of industry.      There must in thefirst place be a thorough understanding of the absolute need inthe interests of every member of the community that industriesvital to our economic recovery shall receive the maximum support from all quarters in the tasks that lie before them.This can be illustrated by reference to agriculture -a vital industry in which production must increase and for whichnew recruits must be obtained.      The Agricultural Wages Boardhas recently substantially increased the minimum wage in Englandand Wales.      The Government have welcomed this proposal as a means of improving the conditions of employment and theattractiveness of the industry and it has been taken fully intoaccount in the preparation of the agricultural expansion programmeincluding the financial inducements attached to it.     Wagemovements in other industries might, however,  have the effect ofcompletely upsetting these new arrangements.Similar considerations arise in connection with government plans for increasing production in other vitalindustries.In the second place,  there must be a full realisation of the need to avoid any general wage movement which will stillfurther increase the inflationary pressure that is affecting our economy.      It is essential that all concerned in the determination of wages and conditions of employment should be fully aware of the dangers of such a movement..    Much will depend on individual employers, particularly in less essential industries adhering to the terms of generally negotiated agreements and not seeking to obtain an advantage in the recruitment of labour by offeringinducements not included in these agreements.Equally,   it must be recognised that the facts of thepresent economic position must be taken fully into account inthe formulation and negotiation of wage claims.      This requirementcan only be fully met if wage claims formulated before 6th Augustare re-examined, whether or&quot;not an application has already beenlodged and whatever the stage short of final settlement, that anyjoint negotiation may already have reached.
The Government have for their part decided that sofar as increase of wages may be advanced as a reason foradjustments in controlled prices, margins or other financial matters requiring Government action,  there can,  in future, beno presumption that -allowance will be made for any wage increasesthat may be agreed by the two sides.      The Government must&quot;be free to consider in each case whether or not such increases arecontrary to the national interest.      They trust that allconcerned will recognise and accept the need for this policy.-9-
