PHIS   DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;8   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1947SECEET .-&quot;   Cop^Ne. 31CP. (47) 2692Qth September, 1947CABINETSTEEL DISTRIBUTION scheme memorandum by the Paymaster-general. At their meeting on 9th September (G.M. (47) 75th Conclusions, Minute 5)the Cabinet invited the Minister of Supply to arrange, in consultation with theFederation of British Industries, for a joint examination to be made into theworking of the existing machinery for controlling the issue of steel to manu-facturers, and for the report of this investigation to be submitted within a fortnight.2. Subsequently, after consultation with the Joint Parliamentary Secretaryto the Ministry of Supply (in the Minister of Supply&apos;s absence), the PrimeMinister invited me to preside over a Committee composed of-Mr. C. K. F. Hague, Managing Director of Babcock &amp; Wilcox, Ltd.(nominated by the Federation of British Industries).Sir John Duncanson, British Iron and Steel Federation.Mr. A. S. Le Maitre, Central Economic Planning Staff.Mr. F. G. Lee, Ministry of Supply.Mr. A. C. Boddis, Secretary, Iron and Steel Board.3. The Committee met formally three times, sitting on each occasion forseveral hours. In the interim, members of the Committee held separate con-fidential discussions with business associates, departmental officials, &amp;c. I myselfdiscussed the matter at length with the acting Permanent Secretary of theMinistry of Supply, Sir Greville Maginness (former President of the Federationof British Industries), Sir Arnold Plant (former Chairman of the MaterialsCommittee) and Mr. Herbert Tout (former Assistant Secretary of the Board ofTrade). The two latter submitted helpful memoranda. The Committee also had before them a valuable memorandum prepared jointly by the Minister of Supplyand the present Chairman of the Materials Committee and two reports of a working party of the Materials Committee. He also took into consultationMr. J. C. Carr of the Ministry of Supply, who has presided over the working party. On the basis of these enquiries our report was completed on Wednesday,24th September.4. At this stage the Prime Minister instructed that the T.U.C. be informed and consulted about the enquiry. On 26th September, therefore, I met Sir MarkHodgson and Mr. George Thomson, who had been appointed for this purpose bythe T.U.C. General Council. I went through the report with them in great detail and they expressed themselves as satisfied with it.5. The report of the Committee is annexed hereto and speaks for itself. I wish to draw my colleagues&apos; particular attention to paragraph 9. Besides the review of order books there referred to, I am convinced that the system of controlover end-products requires to be fortified by a careful watch over the quantityof labour employed by &quot; less essential&quot; users of steel and above all by a reduc-tion of monetary demand for steel for &quot;less essential&quot; purposes. We shalldeceive ourselves if we imagine that any scheme of allocation and authorisation,however well administered, can prevent some &quot; illegitimate &quot; use of steel unless it is fortified by those means.34278
2 j&apos;6;&apos;:, I hope that Ministers of all Departments concerned will issue strictinstructions to their officials to avoid over-authorisation in future.7.   I also recommend -(a). That the Minister of Supply be invited to allot immediately two or three off bis officials to concentrate full-time on working out the details ofthe scheme e.g., the nature of the currency, including the practic-ability of a cheque system, the printing of the currency, the drafting of explanatory instructions to Departments, the steel industry and consumers, and of public announcements. The F.B.I. representative on the Committee has indicated that the F.B.I. might be able to lendthe services of an experienced person to collaborate as required in this work, and the representative of the Iron and Steel Federation hassimilarly offered to make a member of the Federation^ staff available.I think these offers should be accepted.(b) That all Departments should collaborate to ensure the completion of thispreparatory work with the utmost speed and should especially con-concentrate without delay on the practicability of bulk authorisation onthe lines recommended by the Committee.(c) That the Committee which worked with me, with the addition of a T.TJ.C.nominee, continue in being under a Ministerial chairman to review the preparatory, work from time to time.(d) That that Committee be consulted before the issue of any public state-ments about the new scheme.H. A. M.Great George Street, S.W.1,2Sih September, 1947.ANNEXBeport of Joint Committee on the Working of the Steel Distribution. scheme. The Committee feels bound to draw attention to the fact that the strictrationing of a raw material such as steel is much more difficult to attain thanthe rationing of a finished product, even of so diverse a finished product asclothing. Even during the war the allocation and distribution scheme was nota very strict rationing scheme, but it worked well. Since the war, however, thebulk of the staffs then employed by Government on the distribution scheme havebeen dispersed, While the number of approved end uses and the number of ultimate consumers of steel have been very greatly increased, with consequentstrain on the effectiveness of the war-time scheme. The Committee feels, never-theless, that with modification the scheme can be made to work in present-daycircumstances. What it proposes, therefore, is a modification of the presentwell-understood methods of directing distribution. The Committee wishes toemphasise that the goodwill of the producing and consuming industries as wellas of Government Departments is essential to the successful implementation ofthese proposals.2.   The immediate difficulties of the scheme are due to two main causes: (a) Inflation of the currency. This is almost Wholly due to over-allocationsmade by Departments in the period since the war. To some extent itis due to an unexpected decline of steel output during the early months of 1947. The result is that a very large&apos;&apos; backlog&apos;&apos; of orders hasbeen built up, the effect of which so distorts the incidence of deliveriesthat the pattern of the steel delivered to industry in any period maybe very different from the pattern of the allocations made to industry for that period. .(6). Lack of an effective check-There is no effective check on possible misuseof the authorisation, (the &quot; M &quot; form) for duplicate or excessive orders.But this factor has been less important than continued over-allocationby Departments.
8.  There is ho evidence of a widespread black market in steel in the ordinary;ense of the term, or of blatant disregard by industry of the rationing scheme.,Jut if the scheme is to operate effectively and the deliveries are adequately to&apos;eflect current allocations made, it will be essential to eliminate the inflation atiresent in the order books, and to take steps to prevent its recurrence.4. One essential condition of any effective reform will be that Departments-efrain henceforward from over-allocations. No scheme will operate if over-illocation continues.5. Any scheme of reform must (a) deal with the backlog, (b) providemachinery for an effective check on the use of authorisations, (c) restore disciplineind respect for the scheme where laxity has&apos; Crept in. The Committee considershat it will be essential to impress oh all coheSfnM that a hew start is being made.For this reason it proposes that a new currency should be introduced from anippropriate date and that simultaneously measures should be taken to deal with;he backlog so as to ensure that the hew currency starts on a sound basis.\ 6. There is no time to be lost. The Committee has already thrashed out inprolonged discussions the principles upon which the new scheme should operate.These must be translated as quickly as possible into detailed explanatory memo-randa and instructions. An adequate new currency must be printed and pro-vision made for its circulation. This work must be undertaken by officialsspecially seconded for the purpose: Once it is completed, adequate time must begiven to industry to assimilate the memoranda arid initiate the scrutiny of order books which will be necessary. The Committee has devoted much time and thought to a possible time-table and feels reasonably confident that the newcurrency can be successfully introduced and the backlog substantially reduced asfrom 1st April, 1948.7.   The following is the Summary of the arrangements proposed(a) A new currency will be introduced with effect from 1st April, 1948,- and no order may be placed after that date except under the newcurrency. All orders on the books of steel makers for delivery in period II 1948 and subsequent periods will be regarded as coveredby the new currency.(b) Orders authorised for delivery in periods before Period II 1948 butremaining undelivered at 3jLst March, 1948, will be cancelled at thatdate and thereafter no such orders may be executed against theauthority of an &quot; M &quot; form.(c) Orders cancelled under Section (&amp;) of which delivery is still required iriusfebe referred to the sponsoring Department for reauthorisation underthe new currency within its existing allocation.(d) In order to reduce the difficulty and burden of correspondence whichwould otherwise arise in the case of undertakings making parts and components for many different end uses and drawing their authorisation-tions! from a number of sources, Departments should endeavourwherever possible to arrange for such undertakings to be given appro-priate bulk authorisations by one Department in respect of all their production activities.(e) In general it would be desirable in the longer term to extend as far aspracticable the substitution of such bulk authorisations by a single department for the present system of piecemeal allocations. TheCommittee considers that not only would this make for administrativesimplicity, but that it would reduce the risk of over-authorisation.(/) The process of arranging for such bulk authorisations (and for any necessary adjustments of responsibility and allocation between Depart-ments) should be put in hand at once in anticipation of the change-overto the new currency.(g) Every endeavour should be made to couple the introduction of the newcurrency with a simple cheque form system under which the steelmaker or stockholder will be allowed to accept an order only againsta cheque bearing an authorisation symbol and number.(h) A small number of specially selected officers (who would travel freelyto both steel producers and consumers) should be appointed by theIron and Steel Board to watch over and assist the working of thescheme. The Committee regards this recommendation as an important part of the scheme.
(*) Trade Associations for major steel consuming industries should be invite!to appoint (if they have not already done so) liaison officers to main!tain contact with the Iron and Steel Board and the Federation otsteel delivery problems.(j) It may be necessary to continue to apply the P.M.L. symbol to issues.,:c      of the new currency to cover allocations for priority programmes; butthe period during which this arrangement will apply should Delimitedand all P.M.L. symbols for steel withdrawn as soon as the new schemis working effectively.8. It must be recognised that a scheme on the above lines will necessariljinvolve a heavy burden of work on those Departments, like the Ministrjof Supply, which are responsible for allocating steel to very numerous industrialusers. And in particular the measures proposed for the cancellation anre-authorisation of the backlog will equally involve steel consumers in the difficultask of revising their order books and securing Departmental authority for thre-authorisation and re-phasing of those orders which must be maintained. Ilwill be essential to reduce to a minimum the uncertainties and confusion of whatlis bound to be a difficult period. For this reason the Committee urges the widest!possible adoption of the bulk authorisation arrangements suggested at (d) above.It will be essential to ensure that bulk authorisation is not introduced at theexpense of a weakening of control over the end use to which the steel will beapplied : it must, of course, be a condition of granting a bulk authorisation thatthe material so authorised is applied to end uses in. accordance with government policy and not appropriated to less important though perhaps more profitable ends.9. The Committee wishes to emphasise strongly that it will be quite unsafeto rely on the working of the steel distribution scheme alone to secure the most effective utilisation of our steel resources. However large the administrativemachine might be made it would be virtually impossible to impose a meticulouscheck on individual transactions. In other words the steel distribution scheme must be regarded as only one of the instruments of planning control. In parti-cular the Committee is convinced that a greater degree of control by the produc-tion Departments concerned over the production of end products of steel e.g., byreview of the order books of firms authorised to purchase steel is necessary tclimit the use of steel for &apos;&apos; less essential&apos;&apos; purposes and to give an incentive to its use for export and other highly essential purposes.10.   The possibility of excluding certain types of steel (e.g., high speed orstainless steel) from the operation of the scheme might, it is suggested, be investigated further, as might also the possibility of excluding certain types of^iron castings.  But there would have to be continued control over the allotmentof materials at the primary stage for such types of production.
