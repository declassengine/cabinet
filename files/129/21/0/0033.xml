THE  1948 DOLLAR programme . The first detailed assessment of the dollar drain in the full year 1948is so serious that it should be brought at once to the attention of Ministers.2. At 30th September, our gold and dollar reserves were  586 million( 560 million gold and  26 million United States and Canadian dollars) plus 101 million erf unused Canadian Credit. In the last six weeks, we have lost 17 million a week; this is half the rate in the two months before the suspension of convertibility, and we expect the rate of drain to fall further as the effects of the stop-buying-food policy are felt. But by the end of the year, even afterdrawing a further  48 million from IMP. and with substantial gold receipts from South Africa, our reserves will have fallen to  500 million plus  65 million of unused Canadian Credit.The Drain on our Reserves ...3. In 1948, on the import requirements now submitted by Departments, the dollar drain is estimated as follows :^ 1st Half   2nd Half   Total&apos;     ; 1948        1948        1948( m.)

(*) See paragraph 16 below.      (c) See paragraph .17 below.4. On this showing, our reserves, including the Canadian Credit, will havefallen to  325 million by June 1948 and  90 million by the end of 1948.5.   There are two possible resources in sight to strengthen the position : (i) We may be able to draw a further  80 million from I.M.F. in 1948 but this, of course, requires the approval of I.M.F., on which the americans have a decisive voice.. (ii) The Americans may release the  100 million frozen Credit.6. If both of these were obtained, our reserves at the end of 1948 wouldbe  270 million, or slightly above the rock-bottom minimum. But the criticalnature of the situation lies in the rate of drain rather than in the absolute levelof reserves at any particular moment. As our reserves run down, confidenceis rapidly destroyed, and a point is reached at which we cannot buy anythinganywhere except in exchange for gold or essential supplies. The significant factabout the table in paragraph 3 is that we shall not be within sight of dollar!equilibrium by the end of 1948; the drain in the second half-year will be as.big as that of the first half; the reserves at the end of the year, even on favourable34361 bHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT
avoiding catastrophe in the period of years which must elapse before worldrecovery and long-term measures (such as colonial development) can ease ourposition.14. The main source of loss of gold and dollars is the United Kingdomdeficit with the American Continent. The other sources shown in the table inparagraph 3, however, are also very relevant.15. In the table, the gold and dollar drain in respect of the United Kingdomand sterling.area transactions with the non-American world has been put in at 10 million per halfryear; in the past six months, it is estimated at a net figure of 47 million.* Our balance of payments estimates in the appended tables showthat the United Kingdom will have a surplus with the non-American, non-sterling world in 1948 provided that the export drive succeeds. Every effort must therefore be made to pay with goods for the essential supplies we need to drawfrom these countries. But there are some countries with which-the sterling area as a whole is likely to be in deficit e.g., Sweden, Portugal, Persia, Belgium and to which we shall probably have to pay some gold or dollars. The overseas negotiations Committee will have to conduct our negotiations in a way, whichlimits our gold and dollar commitments to the  10 million level, and import cutsfrom specially difficult sources will have to be made as necessary in order to achieve this. A further paper will be submitted on our import arid export policy in 1948towards the non-dollar sectors of the world.16. The dollar drain on account of the rest of the sterling area&apos;s deficit withthe American Continent has been estimated in the light of the discussions of the sterling Area Conference. In the past six months, this drain (excluding SouthAfrica, for Which special arrangements have now been made) was  120 million;for each half of 1948, it is put at  44 million. It would be entirely unrealistic to plan on a lower figure than this; to limit the drain to this figure will requiretreat co-operation and sacrifice, by the sterling area countries, and strong exportsy us to replace dollar imports into these countries. We shall, no doubt, be con-fronted by pressing demands from India and Pakistan, in particular; the figuresincluded on their account here assume that they will be able to get substantial assistance from I.M.F., &amp;c. It will be impossible to achieve this reduction inthe rest of the sterling area deficit unless strenuous efforts are made to increase the sterling area&apos;s dollar income, and particularly that of the Colonies. It would be most imprudent to rely upon a smaller deficit than that shown here; our reserves are those of the sterling area countries as well as of ourselves, and unless we areprepared to sever our financial connection with them (and to lose valuable supplies from them because of their inability to produce for lack of essential dollarsupplies) we must be ready to meet a bill of this size.17. The estimate of gold receipts in 1948 includes the  80 million loan from South Africa. In subsequent years, we may hope to earn a substantial amount of gold, from South Africa; arrangements have now been made by whichwe shall not lose dollars on account of South Africa&apos;s deficit with the rest ofthe world.Dollar Imports and Exports18.

These requirements from dollar sources are framed after providingmaximum supplies from the non-dollar world, and particularly from the Colonies.They are on the following bases : Food. The import programme as a whole would provide a somewhat higher consumption levef than that now ruling -more flour, a Is. 2d. meat ration, a 3-oz. bacon ration for most of the year, more tea, the same sugar and fats, more shell but less dried eggs, and more fresh fruit; on the otherhand, the cheese ration would have to fall to 1 oz. for part of the year, andthere would be less points foods canned meat, canned fish, dried fruit, &amp;c.. All the supplies from the American Continent (apart from feeding-stuffs and linseed) represent long-term contracts, to which we are already com-mitted, and no provision is made for new purchases; the important itemsapart from cereals, feeding-stuffs and linseed are Caribbean sugar( 17 million), Argentine and other Latin American meat ( 53 million),Canadian bacon ( 25 million), Canadian cheese and eggs ( 13 million). Theprogramme in fact assumes continuation through 1948 of the &quot; stop buying &quot;order of last August, but such a large part of the programme is on long-term contract that this is very slow to become effective.Raw Materials. The programme in general provides for the operationof consuming industries to capacity, except where availability is limitedor where the application to the consuming industries of strict austerity inthe home market plus full supplies for export does not require operation to capacity, in which case appropriate cuts have been made. The timberprogramme is designed to maintain present allocations.Petroleum. -The programme assumes no basic ration and continuingrestrictions, but is heavily increased, partly because of much higher prices and partly because of the needs of the oil conversion programme.Manufactured Goods. Importation of machinery is provided on theassumption that licences are issued freely if the machine cannot be supplied. from United Kingdom production in comparable time; import of othermanufactured goods from the American Continent is limited to absoluteessentials plus token imports.Tobacco. Assumes 25 per cent, cut in the pre-Budget level of consumption.Films. -Assumes present duty continues.Overseas Government Expenditure. The main elements in the totalof  50 million are the military expenditure ( 16 million, mainly oil, food,spares for trucks and aircraft); commodity operations, such as purchaseof wheat for Colonies ( 28 million) dollar purchases for which we getrepaid in sterling; United Nations, International Refugee Organisation,administrative and diplomatic expenditure, &amp;c. No allowance is made fordollar expenditure for Germany in 1948. The military figures have not yetbeen adjusted for the latest cuts in the size of the Services, and the other items have not yet been examined in detail by the Exchange requirements committee.Exports and re-exports. These are estimates of receipts arising fromexports to the American Continent according to the export target programme(adjusted for three months&apos; time-lag between shipment and payment).  They,are conservative, for (a) they provide for -a total export averaging 140 percent, of 1938 volume in the second half of 1948, whereas if the&apos; full targets
were reached the average in the second half would be 145 per cent., and(b) they assume the existing pattern of exports between the various markets;z.e., they imply that exports to the American Continent increase at aboutthe same rate as the expansion of exports,generally if the targets are achieved.20.   The aim is to reduce this deficit of  458 million by  175 million.21. The first necessity is maximum development of exports to the American^Continent. It is clear from the balance of payments tables that if we getanywhere near the total export target we shall have plenty of exports to coverour imports from the rest of the world. Everything possible must be done toproduce the maximum output of goods which the American Continent will take,and to sell them there. This may be helped as Canada and other countries areforced for lack of dollars to cut down their imports from United States, andreplace them with imports from United Kingdom. On the Board of Trade&apos;scalculation of the effect of maximum diversion,&apos;which implies doubling our exportsto United States and Canada in the next year, we could hope to earn  10 million more in the first half of 1948 and  35 million more in the second half of 1948- 45 million in all.22. Secondly, it should be possible to secure savings of  10 million in overseas Government expenditure below the estimate shown here. Much of thisshould flow automatically from the Service reductions already decided upon,and Service food and petrol requires special examination in view of the sacrificesbeing asked from the civilian population. The rest of the field has not yet beenfully examined by the Exchange Requirements Committee, and significant reduc-tions should be possible. In particular, our large dollar purchases on behalfof Colonies and other countries must be examined with great care. It must be emphasised that we have taken no account of any dollar expenditure on germany in 1948.,23. Thirdly, provided that the 25 per cent, cut in tobacco consumption is achieved, and taking into account further cuts in Service requirements, and making full use of stocks, it should be possible to reduce the purchase to be made from next year&apos;s United States auctions below the.level indicated above, andthis might yield  3 million.24. Fourthly, a substantial reduction can be made in the petroleumprogramme as set out above, in order to make quite certain that no petroleum products are procured in advance of real need. The whole savings which aremade from the total programme of  104 million will accrue in dollars. Theprogramme can be reduced to  95 million, giving a saving of  9 million in dollars, without interference with the essential needs of industry and transport.Further saving would be possible only at the expense of the oil/coal conversionprogramme. Two further problems arise in the petroleum programme; the extentto which overseas markets should be supplied with oil which costs us dollars,and the oil companies&apos; capital development programme, which, though veryprofitable in terms of foreign exchange in the long run (representing the only means of freeing us from dollar oil expenditure) is highly costly in steel and dollars in the period of development. The first of these is now being examined;the second will shortly be before the Official Oil Committee, and early decisions are necessary.25. Fifthly, it is proposed that a saving of  8 million should be sought inthe manufactured goods programme, and particularly in machinery. In semi-manufactures and consumer goods there is litle scope for further economy, forthese requirements are very carefully screened, and apart from certain cases(e.g., books and periodicals) thereis little room for further cutting/ In machinery;however, dollars have been provided fairly freely, and the programme shouldbe re-examined in order to cut out machines which are required for less essentialpurposes. In the entire machinery and equipment field (including oil equipment and equipment for Colonial development) there may be prospects of obtaining a loan from the International Bank; it is proposed that a composite case should beprepared covering as large a part of the requirements as possible. A loan fromthe International Bank could not be forthcoming much before the end of 1948,but-if it were in sight it would enable us to continue essential dollar-saving;capital projects which would otherwise have to be curtailed or abandoned for lack of dollars.26.   This series of proposals would seek to save  75 million.  There remains.;a further  100&apos; million to be saved, from the food and raw material programmes.
27. A substantial cut in the raw material programme would be a desperate-last resort. It Would at once reduce production and exports, Create widespreaddislocation and Unemployment, and produce the most vicious of all the downwardspirals. If the worst comes to the worst it becomes inevitable, just as it is nowin France.  But we cannot hope to fight our way through by such means.28. To cut food consumption beyond a certain point can have similar effects,unless the need for it is so apparent to everyone that it is accepted as inevitable and necessary to national survival. Even in such circumstances, the repercussionsupon public health cannot be ignored;      .   .29. Striking a balance, it is suggested that the dollar raw^materiaif-require-ments as stated should be cut by  25 million; this is equivalent to 4 per cent,on the total raw material imports from all sources. The available supplies ofsteel from North America will in any case probably fall short of requirementsby some  13 million; a cut of some  5 million will be necessary in the timberprogramme; the remainder of the  25 million will have to be provided by ageneral pruning-for example, there is ccope for reduction of dollar non-ferrousmetal imports by restricting exports of semi-manufactures to certain destinations.It is proposed that the Central Economic Planning Staff, in collaboration withthe Departments concerned, should determine the best means of effecting the saving on the stated requirements. A cut in linseed in the Ministry of food programme would be taken against the raw materials programme.30. We. turn now to the food import requirements, which it is suggested should be cut by  75 million. This operation is impossible as it stands, for allthe food provided in this programme is committed on long-term contracts ofvarious degrees of sanctity. When and in what way these contracts should be broken is a tactical matter. But it is clear that they will have to be broken, forthe simple truth is that we have contracted for more food than we can afford,and in spite of the &quot; stop buying &quot; policy, rations could increase in 1948. this contract situation has meant, indeed, that the hoped-for cut of  12 million amonth in the current year will not nearly be achieved.31. There are three possible means of securing dollar economy equivalentto  75 million : (i) To cancel the contracts; this must clearly be considered as part of negotiations with the countries concerned; for these negotiations, itis of decisive importance that our willingness to do without thesupplies is clearly understood.(ii) To store the food in order to enable us to stay out of the market later ;this  is possible on a significant scale only in sugar, canned meat and cheese.(iii) To sell the food, for dollars or the equivalent (e.g. to sell sugar to theUnited States Administration for distribution as winter-help).32. All of these involve immediate adjustment of consumption. Thefollowing statement shows the savings which would be achieved up to the endof 1948 if rations were reduced to the extent indicated at the earliest possible date:   millionSugar    ...      ......      ...      From 10 oz. to 8 oz. and 25 per cent.cut in manufacturing ...      ...      12Meat     ............      From Is. to XOd.

Limitation of shell egg consumptionto 66 a year compared with thepresent 58, and an earlier ex-. haustion of dried egg stocks ...      10100On the other hand, there is a possibility of removing bread rationing some time during this period.33. The saving of  75 million suggested in paragraph 30 would be securedfrom a combination of these measures.   This would represent some reduction
In consumption below the existing level. The following table is a provisionalcalculation by the Ministry of Food of the nutritional effect, taking into account in the first half of 1948 the impending severe cut in potato consumption :-Calories per day. . .

If the full  75 million saving were made, the nutritional positionin the second half of 1948 would not be worse than it is now, for extra food supplies will then be coming forward from the non-dollar world. But the calorieintake in the first half of 1948 would fall significantly below the 2,800 level whichthe Ministry or Food&apos;s technical advisers regard as the danger-point, and theywould expect this, together with the loss of variety and palatability, adverselyto affect morale and industrial efficiency. These figures may be compared withthose of the later war years, when the calorie intake was about 3,000 and theprotein intake 88 gr. a day.35. Nevertheless, we are of the opinion, that these measures must be accepted,and that a decision should be taken to make cuts on this scale; the practicalpossibilities, should then be examined speedily, in particular to determine howfar the supplies can be resold for dollars or the equivalent and how quicklythe various contracts can be cancelled or reduced in quantity.Conclusion36. We have made these proposals without counting on American aid, otherthan I.M.F. and the unfreezing of the  100 million credit. They are theindispensable minimum for any reasonable chance of getting through the next two years without such aid. But the more determined we show ourselves to pullthrough by our own efforts, the more likely we are to get aid.37. But the dollar problem will not end for. us in 1948, when in any case we shall have, maintained even this reduced consumption level only by incurringfurther debt to I.M.F., to the United States Government in respect of the frozencredit, and to Canada and South Africa. This programme is only the first step towards dollar equilibrium which will be a long and grim process lastingseveral years.38. It is necessary that decisions should at once be taken, both in order to allay public alarm about our position and to check the dollar drain, and to givea sound basis for our further negotiations with the United States and with othercountries with which we must open negotiations.39. This paper has dealt only with the dollar programme. When decisions have been taken on this, a further paper will be submitted on the balance ofpayments as a whole. The most urgent thing is action to stop the dollar drain.
