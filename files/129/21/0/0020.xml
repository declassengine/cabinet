(47) 77th Conclusions, Minute 6),together with a. copy of his reply of 30th September(Annex II) .E . S *Ministry of fuel and Power,  S.W. 1.,2nd October,  1947.
ANNEX IMinistry of Fuel end Power,S.W.  1. ,26th September, 1947.Deer Hyndley,I have discussed with my colleagues your letter of the- 23rd September about the current discussions between the National Goal Board and the National Union of mineworkers for an extension of working hours.You will recall  that the origin of those discussions was the meeting on 30th July at which the Prime-Minister and other Ministers conveyed to the National coal board and the National Union of Mineworkers the Governmentsappeal for an increase in coal production as a contributionto the solution of our economic difficulties.     At thismeeting the Ministers representing the Government put forward the suggestion that the increased production might beobtained by the working of an extra half-hour on eaohworking day.     On the other hand, the representatives ofthe Union asked whether any alternative scheme which wouldbe effective in securing the desired increase in output would be considered and to this the Ministers raised noobjection.You will also remember that on 21st AugustMinisters attempted to use their good    offices to enable a settlement to be reached and submitted to the union the enclosed proposals which had been drawn up by theNational Goal Board.The Board now propose to make an agreementwith the Union which will provide -(i) for longer shifts at those pits or inthose areas where this is mutually agreedto be practicable and the men ere willingto work them;    and(ii) for voluntary Saturday working at otherpits and in other areas with the bonus notlinked to six shifts but with safeguards against the danger of Increased absenteeismthrough the week;and I assume from the second paragraph of your letter of23rd September that the Board consider that an agreement on these lines will secure an increase in the output ofcoal, whilst leaving the Five-Day Week Agreement inviolateand avoiding any further increase in costs.The Government1s view is that the proposal for&apos;the working of longer shifts where this is practicable ona voluntary basis will be beneficial.      On the other hand,they fear that the safeguards against the danger of increasedabsenteeism which the Board now suggest as an alternative to the safeguards proposed by the Board on 21st August
may be ineffective.In order to ovoid any misunderstanding Ishould make it clear that the Government would not wishto issue a general direction to the Board on this matter.The views that have been expressed by the Government were intended to assist the Board in reaching a decision whichwould achieve the objective desired, namely,  an increasein the output of coal,  but the matter is one for theBoard&apos;s decision.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    E.  SHINWELL.Lord Hyndley, G.B.E.,Lansdown House,Berkeley Square, W. 1.PROPOSALS SUBMITTED TO THE national executive OF THE NATIONAL UNION J)lfMINEWORKERS ON 21ST AUGUST.1. A coal-turning shift of 6-g- hours to be worked every Saturday during the Emergency.2. Payment to be at 7 for 6 (i.e. 6 shift payments,pl\is the bonus)  plus whatever is the appropriate overtimeaddition for the Saturday shift (1.e.  an extra half payment for the day shift, or an extra full payment for the backshifts).3. Bonus not to&apos;be paid unless six normal .shiftshave been worked.h. Saturday (or Sunday) payment to be at plaintime instead of overtime unless six normal shifts have been worked.
ANNEX IINATIONAL GOAL BOARD,Lansdowne House,Be r Ice le y 3 gu ar e,London, W.  1,30th September, 1947.My deer Minister,I have received your letter of26th September.&apos;.The proposals to which you refer were,in substance;,  put forward by the Union in their letterto you of 11th September.     We do not expect that theseproposals or any proposals for   overtime working will secure additional coal without any increase in costs,but we shall make every effort  to ensure that labourengaged on overtime working is employed as economicallyc.s possible,  and that the increase in costs is kept downto a minimum.      We shall not continue overtime workingif and where the increase in costs per ton is disproportionateto the increase in output.We share the Government&apos;s concern lest theworking of overtime should prejudice effort and attendanceduring the five normal shifts,  but we feel that we shouldnot decline to examine with the Union the possibility of arranging overtime working without prejudice to thedevelopment of work on the normal shifts.      If and where&apos;the results of organised overtime were unsatisfactory, weshould have to discontinue it.We do not regard proposals on these lines asbeing either adequate to the situation or free from riskbut we are satisfied that they offer the only possible lineof advance at the moment to the Government&apos;s objective offurther increasing output. .   In the light of your letter,we shall resume the examination of them with the union with a view to reaching a settlement and leaving nothingundone which will increase the output of coal.Yours sincerely,(Signed)&apos;   HYNDLEY.The Rt. Hon. E. Shinwell, M.P.
