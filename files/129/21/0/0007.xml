(46) 162) circulated on 18th April, 1946, particulars weregiven of the terms of reference and composition of the Radio and Cable Board.2. Paragraph 2 (d) of the note stated that the Board and its committees would review the functions of the inter-departmental bodies which formed partof the organisation then existing and would reduce them to the minimum requiredfor the co-ordination of matters affecting more than one Department. This taskhas now been completed and a very considerable reduction in the number ofsubsidiary bodies has been made.3. Certain changes have also been made in the main Committees of theBoard. The Civilian Communications Committee and the Services (Operational)Radio and Cable Committee have been combined into a single Joint Civil and services Telecommunications Committee, and a new Co-ordinating Committeeon Radio Navigational Aids has been appointed.4. When the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy was set up, theMachinery of Government Committee (M.G. (47) 1st Meeting) agreed that itwould no longer be appropriate that the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the radio and Cable Board should be Ministers. The Prime Minister subsequentlyapproved the appointment of Sir Raymond Birchall as Chairman of the Boardand agreed that, when matters arose which needed to be considered by Ministers,the Board should report through the Postmaster-General. In consequence, certain changes have been made in the terms of reference of the Board and its committees.5. On matters of defence research, the Board and its Committees will maintain close co-operation with the Defence Research Policy Committee.6. The revised terms of reference and composition of the Board and its committees are set out in Annexes I to IV.(Signed)NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th September, 1947.ANNEX IRadio and Cable BoardTerms of ReferenceTo co-ordinate departmental activities, research, development and produc-tion as regards radio, submarine and overland cables and visual signalling inmatters affecting more than one Department.Members-CompositionSir Raymond Birchall, Director-General, General Post Office (Chairman).Mr. W.
