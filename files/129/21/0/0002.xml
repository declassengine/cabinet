(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY,OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(47) 252 &quot; COPY NO..5TH SEPTEMBER. 1947CABINET3/ECONOMIC RECOVERY: VIEWS OF THEFEDERATION OF. BRITISH, INDUSTRIESNote by the Lord President of the council the Federation of British Industries recentlysubmitted to the Prime Minister a memorandum containingtheir recommendations for remedying the present economicsituation.     They asked if they might have an opportunitythis week of meeting some of the Ministers mainly concerned and discussing with them the recommendations made in thismemorandum.     With the Prime Minister.&apos;s concurrence Iarranged for a meeting to be held for this purpose on 5th September.      I was accompanied at that meeting by the-Foreign Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Presidentof the Board of Trade, Minister of Labwur and Minister ofTransport.I attach, for the information of the Cabinet,copies of the memorandum from the Federation of BritishIndustries (Annex I) and the notes prepared for the use ofMinisters at the meeting with representatives of theFederation (Annex II).I need not trouble my colleagues at this stage witha full record of the proceedings at the meeting.     I will makea short oral report to the Cabinet at their next meeting.H.great George Street, S.W.I.5TH SEPTEMBER, 1947
.   ANNEX :memorandum by the Federation of British IndustriesINDUSTRY AND THE Y/AY TO RECOVERYIt is small wonder that the nation finds it difficult torealise the facts of the economic crisis.     For two years thecountry has &quot;been taught to &quot;believe that we could fight two worldwars, sacrifice all the savings of past generations,  and turn our economy.inside out by concentrating everything on war production,and still at the end be better off than we were before.      Thereare no fruits of victory in total war.The Government&apos;s decision to end free convertibilityof sterling has terminated the availability of the American creditthe balance of the Canadian is running out.     For a few more weekswe can if we wish continue to bring into this country more than we can afford to &quot;buy, by throwing in our last reserves of gold and exchange.      After that, we shall have no choice in thematter;    we shall be able to buy only what we can pay for in exports and services - exports, that we must not only make, butalso sell.Though the issue which has been most dramatically placed before the country is the dollar crisis, we are convinced thatequal importance must be attached to the inflationary position inwhich we find ourselves.      Action should be taken now to prevent this basic trouble of inflation from gaining ground, with all itsown evil consequences of rising prices, of still greater difficulties in export, of shortages and constant delays to production;    in brief, of a total activity in excess of our capacity in machines, materials and manpower.There is one way out of our immediate dilemma - but onlyone.      It is by restoring our credit with the rest of the world.If credit were only a matter of gold and exchange, such a task would in the short term be impossible.      But credit is also -and even more - a matter of prestige and confidence.Much of the world today is&apos; ready to write us off asfinished.      It has done the same before,  and been wrong.      By a demonstration now of courage and genuine determination to fightour own way clear, we could quickly turn world sentiment intoa wish to help us to help ourselves.      We shall need that help,for in the short term we cannot balance our accounts without it.How,  then,  shall we set about this task?-------It is never possible in times of great crisis toimagine in every detail all that will happen as events unfold.Each event reacts upon others, factors which are now unfavourablecan turn to one&apos;s aid.      Our task is to start the processesthat will not only earn the respect of the world and turn&quot;sentiment in our favour, but also set in motion helpful economicinfluences.      &quot;Let us go as far as we can see.,  and then see howfar we can go.&quot;We make our proposals for the starting action that should now be taken.
OVERSEAS QUESTIONSSEuropean CollaborationThe economy, of Britain,- taken alone, is that of a small,highly industrialised country that has &quot;lost many of theadvantages on which its industry was founded, and that cannotfeed or support her.population from her&apos;own resources.If it were not for the closeness of our ties with theBritish&apos; Commonwealth, and for the great sacrifices that theDominions have always made to help us, our position now would seemhopeless.      We think of the Commonwealth first as our partners inpresent difficulties, but it is no detraction to believe also thatwe should recognise the inevitable closeness -of our economic tieswith Western Europe.      A larger economic grouping of thiB kindrepresents, we believe, the essential foundation for the building of a system of expanding trade both in- primary and manufacturedgoods.     We urge the. most strenuous efforts in response to the firstmoves made by Mr. Marshall,  and the most, earnest, study of ways and means by which economic collaboration of this kind may be progressively developed.      The value of combining resources has proved itself in war, and might well be developed in peace&apos;,, withoutin anysway detracting from the evolution of that wider circle ofinternational trade and interchange which is the ultimate objective of us all. -&apos;&apos;The situation in Western Europe as a whole is in generalsimilar to our own.     All these countries, which in the aggregaterepresented so great a traditional market for our goods, are facing the same inability to import, and all alike will be driven in selfdefence to impose import restrictions, to conserve their resources..These countries and Britain alike face the need to do their utmostby their own efforts.      All will have to show that, by mutualadjustments and even sacrifices,  any future help that may be given from America may really set. in motion a process of recovery whichwill leave us all in the end self-supporting.     We cannot expectAmerica to work harder and go short on any other conditions.     .Webelieve that the approach towards economic collaboration in western europe transcends in importance the narrow and shortsighted concept of national interest.We, therefore,  urge that all possible steps should betoken to indicate the desire of the United Kingdom to arrive at abasis of collaboration with the notions of Europe.__Seriousconsideration should be given, even at the risk of some under-employment this winter,  to making a good start with the export ofcoal to Europe, .as an indication of the genuineness of our wish to collaborate, and as a tangible means of assisting the economic recovery of those countries that form a large part of our traditional markets.germany the experience of the lost two years has convinced us thatwe cannot look for the economic recovery of Europe on which much-ofour&apos;future-markets must depend, unless the industry of Germany isonce again put on its feet.      This need not in our view be prevented,by the absolute and overriding necessity of suppressing Germany&apos;swar-potential, as this point, can be safeguarded by the prohibitionof one or two key-manufactures and the close control of certain rawmaterials,  and does not necessitate the ruthless scrapping ofGerman basic industry.
iffIt is not pleasant for us to face the need to encourage the recovery of past competitors.      Nevertheless, the dependence ofEurope upon German supplies and upon Germany as a market is one whichoverrides the difficulties of fair competition, even bearing in mind that the Western Zones of Germany have been in effect shorn of theirhomegrown food supplies,  and must be expected to develop an intensiveexport drive of their own as a means of life.      Clearly the positioncannot be maintained any longer in which, in our existing conditionof dollar shortage, this country should, have to draw on its lastreserves in order to provide the dollar costs of the occupation andthe feeding of the German populace in the British Zone.      The task of rehabilitating German industry is one that must be placedincreasingly in the hands of Germans, freed in a.high degree,  andthe supervisory work of the Control Commission devoted particularly to measures which will (a)  prevent the effective restoration ofGermany&apos;s war potential,  and (b) prevent unfair competition.CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIt is commonly agreed that inflation has to a very largeextent been caused by the starting of more projects than can be finished,  and thus has a.risen a demand, for uiore materials and labourthan can be supplied.     Prom this point of view alone, it is essentialthat a heavy cut in the national programme of capital projects shouldbe made. &quot; ^The same ,,-is true also because of the even more pressinglyurgent need to reduce the gap in our overseas payments.      The verylarge programme of capital projects has not only involved the spending of foreign exchange on materials that would produce no return in the form of export sales, but also it has prevented the devotionto export purposes of the productive capacity and manpower which ithas absorbed.The inflationary effects of the capital expenditure programme will not be overcome until the scale of expenditure is reduced to the level of true national savings.      Total capital outlayis running at  1,600 millions, and after removing self-balancing items,it is clear that the national and local government share of thisenormous total is some  800 millions a year.      Again omitting self-balancing items, net savings are running at about  350 millions( 200 millions from industry and  150 millions from private savings).We draw the conclusion that the needed cut in capital expenditure isof the order of  U50 millions a year.     We can no longer continuetofinance the balance by borrowing it from overseas, and we recommendthat cuts on this scale should be made,  though it will not be possibleto re-deploy the whole cut so as to reduce the overseas debit by alike amount.It is not sufficient to leave it that th.er_e.__ will be &quot;acertain cutting down&quot; of capital expenditure.      This category in factrepresents the one major opportunity for bringing about a reallysignificant swing over of resources to&apos;purposes which directly and immediately pay for&apos;essential imports.      We recognise with regret that these necessary cuts,  however carefully discrimination is exercised in selection, will mean the postponement of many very desirable projects that we should like to see realised, but thecountry must earn them before it will be able to carry them out.Meanwhile,  the swing-over will create a tendency for manpower that istemporarily unemployed to flow towards&apos; the undermanned industries.Industry, &quot;too, will have to contribute its share in thereduction of the programme of .capital projects.      For the time beingwe are in the unfortunate position of having   to sacrifice to some
extent the long term interest &quot;for survival in the short term-.We are, in any case,  of the opinion that far more industrialcapital projects have been started than there is any chance of -completing within a reasonable time, and we accept that therewill now have to be a more rigid justification for those that are to go forward in terms of the contribution that they will maketowards the saving or earning of foreign exchange in the shortterm.      There can be little doubt that a recognition of the need to cancel projects would provide a stimulus to the development of&quot;make-do&quot; measures,  and produce returns comparable to the excellentemergency results.achieved by many firms in fuel economy.Although reductions in capital expenditure will belikely to make the biggest individual contribution to the solutionof our problem1,  other steps will be necessary, and we turn next to the question of increasing production and export sales.HOME PRODUCTION -PROBLEMSCoalIt is useless to talk about any increase in industrial production until steps have been taken to ensure that the coal is available to support it.      it would, moreover-, be an impossibleburden for manufacturing industry to carry on its own shouldersall the additional export which would be needed to make up for      ^the present lack of export of coal itself,  apart from which i&quot;&quot;&quot;European countries requiring coal imports such as Scandinaviacannot accept manufactured products in return for the timber, etc.which this country wishes to import from them.     We repeat ourview previously expressed that the minimum output which can supportour economy in these respects is 220,000,000 tons of coal a year of good quality,  and we are glad.to see that the proposals put.forward by the Government now correspond fairly closely with this figure.Our earlier recommendation,  if adopted,  about the greatimportance of securing a basis of collaboration with Western europe will obviously have the effect of increasing the short term demandfor coal,  and we earnestly hope that the response of the miningindustry will be such as to give the country a chance torehabilitate itself.We realise, of course,  the impossibility in dealing withthe coal problem of treating it as if there were no differences in grade.      Shortages of particular kinds of coal may themselves upsetour whole economy even in the presence of a large total output, andin this connection we draw attention particularly to. the overridingshortfall in the output of coking coals, and of the washed gradeswhich are in such heavy demand from industry.Coal distribution plans for the winter are already underdetailed discussion between the Government and the Federation.&apos;     Butit must be understood that the readjustment of the programme ofcapital projects and the redeployment of labour and materialsreleased from this programme to other purposes of importance toour foreign exchange.position will necessitate a flexibility inthe arrangements so that delivery of coal may be made to conform with the availability of materials industry by industry, and in theend firm by firm.      We urge that most careful attention should begiven to the distribution arrangements in order to avoid the,illogical instances of long hauls which are at present all toocommon.
Electric power.We repeat all that we have said in earlier reportsabout the electricity situation.      Schemes for evening out the load are now being worked out, and. we have every hope that &apos;&apos;these.will reduce, to a minimum any restriction on productionthrough overloading.     We call on every industrial managementas a patriotic duty to co-operate wholeheartedly in localschemes for staggering demand.SteelWe agree that the proposal to increase the productionof steel to Ik million ingot tons in 19I4B should be possible,provided coal and coke are made available in sufficientquantity.     It- would,- of course, be made impossible if there were any question of subjecting the industry to the incalculabledislocation which would- follow from the pursuit by theGovernment during the period in question of their objective of nationalisation.     The qualities produced within thisoverall total tonnage must be carefully balanced to meet theneeds of other industries that are users of steel.TransportAny increases in the output of coal and steel are bound to react on the rail transport system, and we considerthat internal transport remains one of our weakest points.Indeed, the same is the case throughout a large part of theworld, and the aggregate of demand for- rolling stock and materials for the permanent-way is of the greatest importancein our whole economy.      These considerations fully jusfitythe high priority which has been accorded to the manufacture and repair of locomotives and wagons and the supply of steelrails for the permanent way.     All possible assistance shouldbe given by industry to ensure a quick turn round of wagons.ControlsIt is in our view more than ever necessary thatthe Government should recognise the feeling in industry thatcontrols are imposed for control&apos;s sake.      They must dissipatethat feeling, and must prove that in fact controls are subjectto constant- review.     The. country can no longer afford toretain a single unnecessary man in a control office, who can .be released for more productive work, nor can industryeffectively operate under the delays inseparable fromcontrols.Whilst we firmly believe that -the operation of freemarkets and the. price mechanism will best, satisfy the needsof industry, we acknowledge the&quot; impracticability of a suddenabandonment of all controls.     We suggest that in each industry the controls specially concerned should come underintensive review between the Government and representativesof the industry, and that wherever the industry is able toaccept responsibility for ensuring conformity with essentialelements of an overall plan, This method be tried as a substitute for the imposition of controls administered by government Departments alone.
We put forward the general proposition that controlcan itself cause or accentuate shortage, and we would expectmarginal shortages frequently to disappear within a few weeksunder the stimulus of a free market and the operation of theprice mechanism.     We therefore urge that as soon as shortageis merely marginal control should go.THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXPORT SALESThat it will be very difficult indeed to build upexport sales to levels a great deal higher than those already reached, is obvious.     The shortage of foreign exchange is a world problem, and other countries&apos; besides ourselves areimposing import restrictions for this reason.One helpful factor of great importance will follow the heavy reduction that we recommend in the capitalexpenditure programme, namely the freeing of materials.In the engineering industry in particular, large volumes ofpartly finished work are held up for the lack of balancingmaterials and are impeding other production.     The flow and efficiency of production will benefit immensely when this difficulty is removedj and this factor will do,perhaps more^than anything else to enable firms to tackle exports with&apos;.&quot;renewed vigour.    The present entanglement in shortages is responsible in very large measure Indeed for the productionills of today.We urge all industries to concentrate, on maintaining the standard of quality which is associated with the term&quot;British made^.The whole question of costs is the main issue in our export prospects.     We have not only to make the goods, butalso to sell them in conditions of. intense international   &apos;competition.     We view with constant alarm the way that coal,transport and other costs are fixed without any relation toconsiderations of what the market can bear.We ask for a general recognition that the trueinterests of us all lie in a constant devotion to thereduction of costs.     We have for the time being to achieve this   without the full scale of re-equipment that we wouldhave wished to carry out.     Our policy, until the nation can afford more for capital re-equipment, must be one of make do.Costs will benefit when work can be made to flow, following the freeing of raw materials, but it will take the concentratedefforts of all ranks in industry to reduce costs to the pointof meeting competition.IMPORTSMuch as we should like to feel that the steps we have so far recommended would solve our immediate problem, we are bound to admit that a large, contribution will have to come fromthe further curtailment of imports&quot;!     it is idle to say that wecannot close the gap in our overseas account.     In certaincircumstances, if we do&apos;not do so, it will be done for us, as our suppliers will refuse to send us what we need until theyare paid, and we shall not have enough-to pay them.
Only the Government can decide where the cuts must be made.     After all. luxury imports have been stopped., theycan in the main come .from only two sources, raw materials and food.     It would be a policy of despair to concentrateentirely on the materials for industry, as to close downmanufacture beyond a certain point would mean that norecovery is possible.We have noted the Government&apos;s agricultural policyand we agree that the direct contribution that can be made tothe overseas balance of payments makes such a policy necessary.At the. same time, we are not convinced that the .land and labour in the Colonial.Empire is being sufficiently actively developed,and we recommend a considerable speeding up in that direction.To the extent that cuts in raw materials are inevitable, greatest discrimination will be needed in deciding .where these should fall.     The principle to be. applied must beto give priority of import to those materials which can rapidlybe turned to the best account in foreign exchange, either directly or indirectly.     The earliest opportunity should beTaken to give guidance to industry on this point, as otherwise it cannot plan its production ahead.     A realisation thatcertain material will not&apos; be forthcoming will throw up fuel&apos;and man-power that can be directly absorbed in uninterruptedproduction on necessary manufacture elsewhere.DOMESTIC METHODS TO COUNTER INFLATIONDirect action will have to be taken internally to counter existing inflation.     To rely on a curtailment ofcapital projects alone would be insufficient, and it will still be necessary to reduce our total overall expenditure.The Government must make its contribution by a drastic andaggressive review of its expenditure.     Existing swollenstaffs especially must be reduced and freed for directlyproductive work.     We believe that a restoration of closerTreasury control of departmental expenditure is the only effective way of bringing this- about.When it comes to the question of private spending weadmit that we are faced with a dilemma.     We shall not obtainmaximum production - the cure for inflation - unless there is some incentive to produce.      The existing high rate of direct taxation, and especially the system of P.A.Y..E.  as at presentadministered, act as positive deterrents to production.     Yetit is clearly impossible to face a period of further shortages of goods in the shops and. the greater purchasing power thatwill come from longer working hours without anxiety,     Theeffect of increased transport costs will be higher prices anda progressive removal of subsidies would do the same.      the savings Movement will play its important part.     Althoughsuch measures tend to absorb the additional spending power,we cannot tell whether they will be adequate to prevent freshinflationary pressure reaching dangerous levels.Should it be decided to impose higher taxes, theymust be devised in such a way as to leave the taxpayer withthe feeling that extra effort is not penalised by inequitabletaxation demands.     We favour reliance on indirect rather thandirect taxation.

ANNEX IIBrief for Meeting, with Federation of   -British Industries at 11.0 aam.  onFriday. 5th. September,.19U7. at No. 10, Downing: Street&quot;    tJ discuss memorariaum^rKiaustry. and the Way toRecovery.&quot; -This Memorandum by the FBI considers thatthe outstanding difficulties at the root of thepresent economic crisis are the foreign exchange,problem and the internal inflationary situation.The main contribution lies in the -sections dealingwith inflation, and the FBI. are likely to press very&apos;hard the counter measures suggested in their memorandum - particularly, the drastic reductionof the investment programme,  the pruning of government expenditure and the adjustment of taxation in a   &quot;manner which will mop up surplus purchasing power with least damage to incentives.Apart from these,  the recommendations donot contain anything new or startling and in manycases action is already being taken on the lines proposed.     While setting out to be be co-operative,the Memorandum says&apos; little about how to make progress with the problems of which we are already aware.Overseas&apos; Questions ,European CollaborationThe policy that it being pursued by theGovernment is in full accord with the desire of theFederation of British Industries that we should presson towards wider economic collaboration v/ith western europe.      This has already beon demonstrated by theinitiative of the Government in starting talks inParis and pressing on with them.      The conference is still in session, - but it is expected that it will emerge with proposals for common action covering a wide field of primary resources and for the promotion of freer trade among&apos; the &quot;Western European nationsthemselves.      we for our part are also ready topress forward with the examination of further measureswhich could not be undertaken in the short time available in Paris, .As regards the export of coal the Government isalive to its importance not merely as a&quot;contributorto our export target, but -also to the speedy recovery of the shattered economies of Europe,      It is theGovernments intention to do its utmost to increase and restore our former exports of coal.     It will&apos;bedifficult to do so immediately in view of the coal production position and of the prior- need to ensure
17-sufficient .supplies to sustain our own industries and to meet essential domestic requirements.     Thepremature resumption of coal exports on a significantscale before an increased level of output is in sightwould not only do a disservice to our own people, but would gravely injure our capacity to make our duecontribution to the- restoration of Europe, if it merelyresulted in crippling important sections of our ownindustrial economy.,     in this connection it is pertinentto refer to the comment made by. the Federation else wherein their Memorandum that &quot;It is useless to talk about any increase in industrial production until steps have been taken to ensure that the coal is available tosupport it&quot;.     without that increased industrial production we cannot have a viable economy9 unless weare content to. accept a very greatly reduced standardof living all round.      Furthermore it would be idlemerely to make a gesture until we can be satisfiedthat exports of coal to Europe, once started,  can infact be maintained.;     If the. Federation choose tocontest this view.? they might be invited to suggestwhere in&quot;^HeTr. opinion home&apos;, requirement s could be.sacrificed in order to make significant additionalquantifies of coal available for export.  &apos;  The FBIrepresentatives may suggest in reply that the severecut which they propose in capital -investment willhave the effect of releasing coal which could be-madeavailable for -direct export.      In so far as this is soit would naturally be very welcome, but it may be observed that in as much as the reductions in homeinvestment will not reduce the level of steel production, there can be no coal savings either in the steel producing or steel using industries.The possibilities of significant savings of coal:in the building materials industries are alsomarkedly circumscribed by the fact that these industries are at present running at levels below what is necessary to sustain the present building labour force, and in any event the largest coalconsumer in this field, viz. the cement industry,could, with profit continue to use the same or anincreased coal allocation in order to take advantageof the export market in cement..      The Government is,however, deeply conscious of its obligations to europe, and as&apos; an earnest of its determination to fulfil those obligations, it has offered at the.Paris discussions to resume exports of coal&quot;&quot;to europe next year on a scale of 6 million tons risingin 1951. to nearly 30 million tons. .   -germany the revised level of industry plan forthe Combined Zone was announced on 29th august and after the Memorandum by the FBI was prepared.This shows that the broad- lines of our industrial policy in Germany are in keeping with therecommendations made by the Federation.
Our control has not been reduced, to the point where onlyone or two key manufactures are prohibited, but the scale ofcontrol has been reduced as has the number of plants capableof peaceful use which are to be scrapped.It is already policy in the Combined Zone to place inGerman hands as far as possible the task of rehabilitatingGerman industry.    The British Element of the Control Oommisslonare, of course, active both in preventing the effectiverestoration of Germany^ war potential, and in preventing unfair competition from German industry.    In the present economy ofscarcity, however, they must retain a more extensive controlover German administration than would otherwise be necessary.Decentralisation and delegation of authority to Regional Officestincluding German Regipnal Offices, are being carried out&apos;where-ever possible.The recognition by the F.B.I.  of the unavoidable necessityof resuscitating German industry and exports in competition withour own is important and valuable.   .It should be useful to usin .dealing with any further representations from individualBritish industries who may, naturally enough, not be in line with the F.l. I.&apos; view.   It might be worth while inviting theF.B.I. now to do what it can to stop such individual criticisms of policy in Germany, while at the same&apos; time assuring the F.B.I.that concentration on&apos; the measures they, suggest with regard towar potential and the prevention of1 unfair competition is Tnline with&apos; Government policy.Qo-operation with other countries in&apos; Europe.The Government&apos;s efforts to develop economic collaborationare not limited to Western European countries and Germany.    Itmay be opportune to remind the Federation that the Governmenthas been doing and is still doing its utmost to negotiate tradearrangements with countries in Eastern   Europe which will enable us to replace or augment dollar imports of essential foods andother commodities by supplies from Eastern European countries who are prepared to accept more readily and in larger, measure the types of manufactured goods which we find difficulty inselling ih dollar areas.    Examples are the recent trade agreementwith Poland; food purchases in Hungary; the negotiations whichhave been taking place with Russia; and those which are now inprogress with Yugoslavia.    It virould be useful to emphasise at - hisstage the valuable contribution that industry&apos; can make towardsthe successful outcome of such negotiations by giving its fullestco-operation in adjusting its production to supply the types ofgoods in: whim oh such countries stand in greatest need.&apos;Capital Expenditure?hG GoTe:p^eirfc        already announced its intention toSVte ^hH?0ltW? both Pub1^ ^ private?? capitali?T? ? te ofc^ect of concentrating on projects whichwill give quick returns in additional exports or reduce ourdSSStSS! 0n lrnp0rtS* 0r strengthen ou/basio industrial*-* ,
An exhaustive review is now in progress over thewhole field of investment programmes and it is hoped to achieve substantial reductions in. these programmes, whichshould have the two-fold result of speeding up the periodof completion by concentrating on a smaller number of projects,  and of releasing resources of man-power,materials and capacity for purposes&apos;which will make aquicker contribution to the recovery of our external economic solvency.Until this review is completed during the currentmonth it would, not be profitable to. forecast the extentof the reduction which may be feasible, but doubt may becost on the possibility of effecting a cut of the orderof  h50 million proposed by the Federation.The Federation seem to have given insufficientweight to the fact that almost half the total gross annual,investment of approximately  1,600 million consists of replacement expenditure to&apos;make good depreciation of cur existingassets.    While a contribution can undoubtedly be secured by deferring replacements and running down some of our existing assets for a period,  there is a limit beyond which it is not possible to go without impairing ourproductive efficiency and prejudicing our ability to retain our place in the industrial race and to keep our prices atthe competitive levels by which the Federation rightly setsgreat store.    If on the other hand a cut of the magnitudesuggested by the Federation were imposed mainly on netinvestment, it would involve a cut of the order of 50 percent and would probably make it impossible to undertake the large capital works that are essential for therestoration of our basic services, for the equipment ofour agriculture, power supplies,  the mines and transport,for the provision of housing on the scale necessary to attract workers to those industries which will have to bemanned up,  and to provide for-the selective expansion andre-organisation of those- industries which con bestcontribute to our balance of payments problem.Furthermore,  it is clear that a sudden cut of the.order proposed could not be achieved merely by the postpone-ment or writing down of programmes approved but not yet       . .started.    It would involve the stoppage of many projectsalready in course of construction,    ii balance must be struck between gains to be achieved by the redeployment of resources to other purposes.and the waste of the resourcesalready absorbed in unfinished projects.Apart from such reservations on the size and timing of the investment cuts,  the Federation may be assured thatthe Government accepts their view that it is essential toreduce the inflationary pressure of current investment programmes as a fundamental means of securing more productivedistribution of labour and other resources.    Steps will betaken to meet this need by cutting down the resourcescurrently allocated for investment, and in so far asinvestment is financed by borrowing the Governmenfs policy will be reflected in the administration of the CapitalIssues Control over borrowing by Local Authorities and by industry.-k-
The opportunity&apos;might usefully be token to ask theF. B. I.  to indicate more precisely how they think that thereduction in the -programme of capital, expenditure might best be secured, particularly in the field of private capital expenditure oh. plant and machinery, of whichthey have expert -knowledge.    The Planning Board at their meeting yesterday agreed to extend such an invitation.GoalIn their observations on coal the F. 3. T. are oncommon ground with the Government, and discussion of theminimum output necessary to support our economy in the sense indicated by the Federation does not seem&apos;to becalled for, .   The Federation may be assured that the specific points which they make about grades of coal,flexibility in distribution of supplies to conform withthe changing requirements of industry, and the elimination of &apos;unnecessary long hauls ore being and will continue tobe most carefully watched by responsible Departments,    Onthe lost mentioned point, many of the apparently illogicalinstances of long hauls are due to the limitations imposed by geographical distributions and by the lirni-ted inter-changeability of different types of coal,  and occasionallyto the fact that long hauls may be necessary to avoidtransport bottlenecks.    Examples of what appear to beuneconomic distribution frequently turn out on examination to be justified when all the facts are known,    If. however,  the F..B. I. can indicate instancesknown to them which illustrate their point, responsibleDepartments would be glad to investigate them at once.Electric&apos;PowerHere again there is common ground between the F.B. I.and the Government which has accorded the highest priority to the&apos; construction of new generating capacity to remove the present gap between the demand and supply..&apos;ofelectricity.Appreciation will no doubt be expressed for theassistance that the F.B.I.  can afford in encouraging    -their constituents to &quot;co-operate to the fullest extent in schemes which are being arranged locally for thestaggering of demand during the coming Winter.SteelThe F.B.I.  express their agreement with the Government&apos;proposal to increase steel production in 19^8 to lh million ingot tons.    Broadly speaking there is sufficient steel .making and finishing capacity to enable this target to bereached.    Every effort will be made by the Government to^make available to the iron and steel industry the necessarysupplies of coal and coke called for by this targetprogramme, and efforts ore being made to allocate supplies to the industry this Winter to enable it to produce inthe final quarter of this year at an annual rate of 13^million tons.    The limiting factor for 19k8 may very well
lie not so much in the supply of coal and pig ironas in the supply of scrap, of which imports at a rateof 1-g- million tons will be needed to achieve the target set.    Special efforts are being made to obtainsupplies on this scale.TransportIt is recognised that the satisfaction of thedemand for freight locomotives &quot;and wagons and for materials for the permanent way is of the greatest importance.    The principal limitations on the capacity to meet these needs are supplies of steel and timber.As a result of .the priority now accorded to the materials for this purpose,  the situation should graduallyimprove, but there are heavy arrears to be overtaken.Large programmes for the repair or replacement of rolling stock and the renweal of track exist and willbe carried out as fully and as quickly as supplies ofmaterials permit.    It is expected that there will bea great strain on the transport system this Winter,  andit is important that too optimistic a note &quot;should notbe struck-in the discussions with the F.B.I.  on thispoint.An injunction to industry to assist in every-possible way to ensure a quick turn round of wagons canbe heartily endorsed._This point has for a long time been pressed upon industry through every availablechannel.   An average of a day&apos;s saving in the turn round of all wagons would in itself -provide additionalavailability of about 100.000.controls the Government might indicate their sympathy withthe principle enunciated here,  while at the same timeaffirming their doubt as to whether some intensification of controls in certain directions can be avoided at thepresent time.    Many of these controls are in factrequired because of the inflationary pressure about whichthe F. B.I.  expresses great concern.    It might be worthv/hile&apos; confirming that the F.B.I.   agree,  for example,that iron and steel and other.material controls must becontinued for the present, and that greater discrimination between firms in particular industry in the light of their export performance and other factors may be called for.While the Government does not dissent from the proposition that there may be fields in which responsibility for ensuring conformity with essential elements of the overall plan could be entrusted to industry itself,  the   -exercise of discrimination between firms in an industrydoes not appear to fall within this field.    The F.B.I.may be invited to specify the -particular controls whichin their opinion should either be relaxed or entrusted to industry to administer&quot;._and an offer could be mode ,to examine ribintly with industry &quot;the case for doing soin-selected instances.
The Development of Export SalesThe F.B.I.  now know of the conference to&apos;take place in central Hall at which the President of the Board of trade will announce the Government&apos;s export programme and the changesin -machinery that are necessary in order to realise this programme.    The F.B.I, will not expect the Government to anticipate the statement to be made on that occasion.The main point in this section of the Memorandum, apartfrom the reduction of investment, is the section about keepingcosts down,.    The. implication of these remarks about coal,transport, etc., is that these should be subsidised.    The F.B.I,might be asked if this is what they&apos;mean, and if so how ibis squareswifcLtheir demand for reduced Government expenditure.    Otherwisereference may appropriately be made to the Prime Minister&apos;s appeal against wage increases except in special cases and tothe general necessity of increasing industrial efficiency, about which thfe F.B.I. might have been&apos; expecTed &apos;t&apos;o&apos; make more constructive suggestions..   For the present the major worry isnotvthe price but the quantity of coal and transport that can bemade available.    In. the longer term the answer lies&apos;in reducingcosts of both coal and transport by increasing efficiency in both these industries.ImportsThe Government recognises that a substantial contributionto our balance of payments problem must come from the curtailment of imports.    The Government is fully sensible of the need for maintaining imports of raw materials at a level adequate to sustain the productive effort which industry will be,calledupon to make to further the export drive and ;to meet basicessential homo&apos;needs,    Xt must be assumed that in the formulation of these production programmes and targets^ due provision willbe made in the import programmes for supplies:;:of the requisitematerials.As regards the development of the land and labour of theColonial Empire, the Government is providing under theColonial Development and Welfare Acts some  120 million whichtogether with substantially larger sums to be contributed from colonial Governments,? own resources or from public borrowings&apos;ywill be spent on basic services, both economic and social.Programmes already,-approved for 16 colonies provide for a totalexpenditure of, 175 million.    This will provide a background of basic services&quot;, and in addition Government finance is now envisaged for the undertaking of individual productive enterprisethrough a Colonial Development&apos;- Corporation with resources of 100 million and an Overseas Food Corporation .with resources of 50 million,-  In addition private enterprise is undertaking aconsiderable amount of development, and two of the Banksoperating in the Colonies have set up a special development corporation to help in this.    Many schemes are already in fulltrain, including the great East African Ground Nut project whichenvisages a capital expenditure of  2h million.    So are railwayextensions and additions to railway equipment required to open urjnew mineral areas, e.g., in Tanganyika,,  or to move increased .   .quantities of produce, e.g. in West Africa.
. The major obstacles to these developments are in thesupply of equipment&quot;rather than in the supply of finance orin the development of plans.    It will&quot;be recognised also thatwith few exceptions dividends from these projects-&apos; cannot beexpected in the short term.Domestic Measures to Counter Inflation(a) Reduction of Government expenditure.    Treasurycontrol of&apos; departmental^expenditure has been restored and is substantially on a pre-war basis.   Proposals for new expenditure are subject to rigorous&apos;examination in the light of presentcircumstances.    In existing expenditure, all practicableeconomies will be made:   .an example is the overseas expenditureof the Government.   &quot;(Another example, &apos;which however should notbe mentioned,    is the expenditure on food subsidies,, which Isbeing reviewed).As regards Government staff,.there has been a&apos; recent reviewof the whole field by a Committee of Ministers, which has ledto a reduction in numbers.   Arrangements have &quot;now been, made for afurther review of civil service man-power, in order to preventundue employment on non-productive worlt. and to reduce, further,the total&apos; number of Civil Servants employed.(b) Reduction of private spending.    As regards taxation,nothing can. be said in advance or the&apos; chancellor&apos;s decision-on whether there should be an Autumn Budget.* But the Treasurynotes the F.B.ITs preference for indirect; rather than direct taxation.. .The P.B.I. adds &quot;the Savings Movement will play itsimportant part&quot;.-  This should be strongly endorsed,. Whateverdecisions are taken about taxes and the price level, theGovernment counts on the voluntary support of the public as expressed through the National Savings Movement.    The Chancellor,in his broadcast of 20th August, said:-&quot;In this emergency, idleness is a crime; thereis no substitute for hard work, ifwe&apos;are to restoreour national economy, -.....&quot;And there is one thing all can do, young and oldalike.   We can all support the National Savings Movement.Buy more Savings,Certificates, more Defence Bonds, putmore money in the Savings Banks,   This great Movementwas never more necessary ,than now.   It is one of our best defences against inflation.    In these days of shortage put your money by, so that you may have it still to spend when the days of abundance..come. - Many millions of us are. organised in this Great Savings Movements   Leteach of us go to it v/ith redoubled Snergy, and let many millions more join in the good work&quot;.,The Savings Movement are intensifying their &quot;Silver Lining&quot;Campaign v/ith a series of local efXorts   this Autumn,   We ^ounton brgamssed industry to, give these efforts their full&apos; support.
.  Although it is not possible to do more than take note of the F.B.I&apos;s representations on fiscal matters, the,F.B.I.are likely to press these points pretty hard   There can be nodoubt that, the present situation is inflationary and that this makes planning very difficult, especially the transfer of labourand the encouragement of exports.    It also involves a burden-some system of controls.    Furthermore, whatever the presentinflationary pressure, it will be accentuated by a fall in imports and an increase in exports.
