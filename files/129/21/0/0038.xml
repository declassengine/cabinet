The Minister of Defence will continue to discharge the co-ordinating andsupervising functions described in the White Paper on Central Organisation for defence (Cmd. 6923).The Lord Privy Seal will have general oversight over Government business inthe House of Lords. In addition he will assist in the co-ordination of policiesaffecting Commonwealth relations.Inter-departmental business. The heavy volume of Government business makes it essential that ministers should do their utmost to lighten the work of their colleagues and themselves.   To this end the following points should be borne in mind.3. Papers for the Cabinet and for Committees should be as short as is consistent with submitting the essential points. It is the duty of Ministers toensure that this is done by personal revision of papers submitted to them bytheir officials. It is convenient for the points on which decisions are required tobe set out clearly at the beginning or the end of the paper.4. While Committee meetings provide at times a useful forum for thediscussion of policy and for enabling Ministers to ensure that their points of vieware understood and to make a contribution to the formulation of policy, theirprime object is the despatch of business and the making of decisions.5. Much time is lost in the aggregate if meetings do not begin punctuallyat the appointed hour. Ministers and officials should make a special point ofbeing punctual at all official appointments.6. Inter-departmental questions should be settled as far as possible between officials, or failing that between Ministers, of the Departments directly concerned.They should not be allowed to drag on. Failing agreement recourse can be had tothe Lord President, the Minister for Economic Affairs or the Prime Minister.This will often make it unnecessary to take the matter to a Committee.7. Much time of Ministers and of officials can be saved by personal contactinstead of correspondence and the circulation of Minutes.8. Under-Secretaries should be kept fully informed of the general businessof the office so that when called upon to attend a Committee in place of their ministers they understand the subject and do not merely reproduce a brief.Secrecy9. Members of the Government are reminded that they must not discussGovernment policy with people outside unless it is necessary for its transaction.They should be careful not to discuss Government policy in places where theycan be overheard. In particular it is contrary to the doctrine of collective responsibility to make known the attitude taken by individual Ministers on matters of policy. There have been leakages from time to time which embarrass the Government and assist its opponents.
Speeches10. Ministers are reminded that when addressing meetings they must keepwithin the ambit of Government policy and not anticipate decisions not yet made public. They must be careful in dealing with matters within the responsibilityof other Ministers not to embarrass them by statements at variance with Minis-terial pronouncements. In all cases of doubt they should consult the department concerned.   This applies particularly to external affairs.Parliamentary Private Secretaries11. Parliamentary Private Secretaries must be persons of discretion. Itis wrong for them to associate themselves with particular groups advocatingspecial policies.0. R.

APPENDIXInteb-Dfpartmental Organisation for Economic PlanningSUBJECT to the Cabinet, the major issues of economic policy are decided by the Economic Policy Committee, over which the Prime Minister presides.Hitherto, overseas economic questions and internal economic questions have beenhandled by separate Committees. The establishment of the Economic PolicyCommittee creates a focus, below the Cabinet, at which the two aspects of ourieconomic problem can be brought together and the organisation of our internal economy reconciled with the needs of our foreign trading. The Committeeincludes, in addition to the Prime Minister and the Minister for economic affairs, the senior members of the Cabinet who exercise co-ordinating functions in matters bearing on the economic plan, viz., fiscal policy, overseas affairs and home policy.2. The Minister for Economic Affairs is equally concerned with the two sides of our economic problem. On the external side he shares with the Chancelloiof the Exchequer the responsibility for submitting to the Economic Policy Com-mittee and the Cabinet a balance of payments programme. On the internal sidehe is responsible for framing, for submission to the Economic Policy Committeeand the Cabinet, a general economic plan for achieving the required level ofproduction for export and for the home market; and he co-ordinates the executionof the approved production programmes.3. The Paymaster-General assists the Minister for Economic Affairs in thedischarge of these duties.The Central Economic Planning Staff (under Sir Edwin Plowden) and theEconomic Section of the Cabinet Secretariat, though remaining part of the central machinery serving Ministers collectively, work under the supervision of theMinister for Economic Affairs. The Planning Staff, though concerned primarily with the planning of industrial production in this country, participate in theinter-departmentarmachinery (described below) for studying balance of paymentsquestions; and they also take into account the possibilities of developing our colonial resources in food and raw materials.4. The Economic Planning Board, on which representatives of the economic planning Staff and senior officials of the Treasury and the main economic Depart-ments sit with representatives of both sides of industry, is empowered &quot; to advise his Majesty&apos;s Government on the best use of our economic resources, both for-the realisation of a long-term plan and for remedial measures against our immediate difficulties.&quot; The Board, though primarily concerned with the structure of our internal economy, must also take account of balance of payments difficulties and the measures required to meet them.5. Finally, the Official Committee on Economic Development (previouslyknown as the Steering Committee) is also designed to take account of externalas well as internal economic problems.   This Committee, which is under the
5289Chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury, includes among its members the head of the Economic Planning Staff and the Permanent secretaries of the main economic Departments. Though this is the senior official Committeein this field, it is not intended that all recommendations from the Planning Staffor from subordinate official Committees should be considered by it before sub-mission to Ministers or to Ministerial Committees. The Committee provides,however, a convenient forum for the discussion of certain matters which can usefully be considered by the permanent Heads of the main economic Departmentsbefore submission to Ministers.6. On the external side, the main inter-Departmental organisation is thatconcerned with the balance of payments. The Exchange Requirements Com-mittee, an official Committee under Treasury Chairmanship, collects material for constructing, at half-yearly intervals, a balance of payments table and screensDepartmental estimates of imports, Government overseas expenditure, &amp;c. the overseas Negotiations Committee (under the Chairmanship of the permanent secretary to the Minister for Economic Affairs), supervises the conduct of bilateral negotiations for trade and payments agreements with the particular countries from which our supplies must be drawn. A working party drawn fromthese two Committees prepares proposals for a balance of payments programme.In the light of the advice tendered by this working party, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister for Economic Affairs decide what recommendationsthey will submit through the Economic Policy Committee to the Cabinet for thefinal determination of a balance of payments programme and the adjustments ofeconomic policy which that programme will entail. The Exports Committee(under Board of Trade Chairmanship) is responsible for determining and pro-progressing export targets and stimulating production for export. The work ofthese three Committees is closely interlocked and they are served by a commonSecretariat. A detailed description of the inter-relations between them is contained in CP. (47) 287.7. On the internal side, the Committee organisation stems from theProduction Committee (under the Chairmanship of the Minister for economic affairs). This Committee supervises the production programmes (both for export and for the home market) required to give effect to the general economic plan,and considers questions of internal economic policy. It takes over the economicwork hitherto handled by the Lord President^ Committee. This is a largeCommittee, which will meet regularly once a fortnight to discuss questions ofgeneral interest. It is contemplated that its work will be supplemented by anumber of smaller Committees concerned with particular aspects of internal economic planning. Committees of this kind have already been constituted for specific purposes. Thus, the Labour Committee is concerned with the re-deploy-ment of labour and the use of foreign labour. The Distribution of IndustryCommittee supervises the development of Government policy for securing a balanced distribution of industry and, in particular, considers the problems ofthe development areas.
8. The Materials Committee allocates raw materials which are in short supply. The Fuel Allocations Committee determines the amounts of coal to bemade available for particular industries. The Paymaster-General presides over these allocation Committees and their work is carried out under the general supervision of the Minister for Economic Affairs. Their Secretariat works underthe supervision of the head of the Economic Planning Staff.9. All these Committees concerned with the structure of our internal economy have the assistance of the Economic Planning Staff, which plays a continuous part in co-ordinating action at the official level. This co-ordinatingwork is carried on largely by ad hoc meetings with officials of the Departmentsconcerned. There are, however, two Standing Committees centring on theEconomic Planning Staff. The Economic Planning (Official) Committee includes the Planning Officers of the main economic Departments and handles a largenumber of questions of common interest in the field of internal economic planning.The Investment Programmes Committee keeps under review the proportion ofour economic resources which is directed to investment in buildings, plant ormachinery.10. The organisation described in this note is not designed as a rigidhierarchy of Committees. Though some of these Committees are subordinate to others, it is not intended that all recommendations from a lower Committee shallbe passed up through the various superior bodies. The Materials Committee, forexample, though it works within the framework of policy laid down by theEconomic Policy Committee or the Production Committee, is able to report any difficulties direct to the Minister for Economic Affairs, who can submit themto either of these Committees or to the Cabinet itself as he may thinkappropriate. Similarly, the Overseas Negotiations Committee, though workingwithin the general supervision of the Official Committee on Economic Develop-ment, is able, through the Minister for Economic Affairs, to seek a decision fromthe Cabinet or the Economic Policy Committee on any particular issue ofimportance and urgency which may arise in the negotiation of a trade agreement.It is the duty of the Chairmen and Secretaries of the various Committees to seethat the organisation is used, and business is routed, in the manner best calculated to secure speed in reaching agreed decisions.
