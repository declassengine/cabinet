THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF- HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.    October 1947299SECRETCopy No.    3  CP, (17) 29017th October, 1947CABINETCOMMITTEE OF PRIVILEGES-REPORTS ON THE CASES OFMr. GARRY ALLIGHAN, M.P., AND Mr. EVELYN WALKDEN,M.P.THE Reports of the Committee of Privileges in the cases of Mr. GarryAllighan (Gravesend) and Mr. Evelyn Walkden (Doncaster) (H.C. 138 and 142)await consideration by the House of Commons next session. The Reports shouldbe considered immediately following the Debate on the Address.2. It will be remembered that the Committee found Mr. Allighan andMr. Walkden were guilty, the former in aggravated circumstances, of sellinginformation as to what had taken place at secret meetings of the parliamentary labour Party to the Evening Standard and the Evening News respectively inreturn for payments by those papers.Mr. Allighan and Mr. Heighway, the Editor and Publisher of the World&apos;press News, were further found guilty of a contempt of the House by respec-tively writing and publishing an article in which it was alleged that Membersgave away information about secret Party meetings either in return for paymentof money or kind by newspapers or when they had been &quot; lubricated intoloquacity &quot; by newspaper correspondence and were&quot; in a state of &quot; semi-sobriety.&quot;3. The facts are not really in issue, and they disclose conduct which onany view must be regarded as disgraceful. I will return to this point, but Ishould deal in the first instance with the important question how far meetingsof a section of Members, such as. for instance, the Parliamentary Labour Party(as distinct from meetings of official Committees of the House), whilst discussingcurrent or pending Parliamentary business, attract to themselves or to theMembers taking part in them any of the law and custom of Parliament affectingthe conduct of Members.4. This is a matter about which two views are possible, and indeed in theCommittee of Privileges itself Lord Winterton and Mr. James Reid, K.C., dis-sented from what by implication, although I think incorrectly, they suggestedwas the majority view of the Committee. They held that private party meetingswere in fact the private concern of those who held them and were in no sensepart of the transactions of the House. They considered that a section of members could not by agreeing amongst themselves, for instance, to hold a secret meeting,clothe themselves with privileges which only belong to Parliament as a wholeor create new privileges.5. Without going quite so far perhaps as this, in substance I share the minority view, but I should point out that they did not correctly represent theline taken by the Committee, whose Reports do not in fact contain any suchproposition as is dissented from by the minority. The Committee expresslystate (paragraph 17) that their conclusion that the attendance of Members atprivate Party meetings held within the precincts of the Palace of Westminsteris attendance by Members in their capacity as such, does not attract to such meetings all the privileges which are attached to the transactions of parliamentary as a whole, and they state in terms (paragraph 20) that the publication of inf information-V tion about secret Party meetings (even when given or obtained for money) couldnot be regarded as a breach of the old rule permitting Parliament to treat anunauthorised report of the proceedings as a breach of privilege.  The committee memorandum by the Lord President of the Council34382b
make it clear that the disclosure of information about secret Party meetings in itself constitutes no breach of privilege : it is only in the case of a transactionin the nature of bribery that they consider privilege involved, the privilege then in point being that which makes bribery of Members &quot; a high crime and mis-demeanour &quot; (May, p. 121) and not that which concerns publication of debates.6. The first question is, therefore, whether persons attending Party meetingscan properly be regarded as doing something which is part of or incidental totheir work as Members of the House, since it is only if payments are: madeto them in connection with their work as Members that any question of privilegearises.7. The Report shows that there are arguments both for and against theview that a Member who for material reward reveals to a stranger matters relating to parliamentary business dealt with at a Party meeting can be said in so doing to have acted in his capacity as a Member. The majority of theCommittee, for the reasons set out on pp. x and xi, conclude that attendance at such meetings are incidental to the work of Members, and Sir Gilbert Campion,on the authority of the precedent in the Sandys case, is of the view that the privilege of freedom of speech attaches, in certain circumstances, to communi-cations made to such meetings of specific items of current or future business.It is important to read Sir Gilbert&apos;s second memorandum in the light of theevidence which he subsequently gave (p. 111).Shortly then, the view of the majority of the Committee, as shown by para-graph 21 of their Report, is that Mr. Allighan and Mr. Walkden were guilty of breaches of privilege because they supplied for material reward confidential information which they had acquired as Members of Parliament, the crucialpoint being that they had acquired it in their capacity as Members.8. I&apos; would not be disposed to enter into the refinements of any argumentas to exact status of Party meetings, but, particularly after further consultationwith Sir Gilbert Campion (who has kindly permitted me to annex to this memo-randum his confidential observations on the subject), I have come to the conclusionthat we should not take the line that in these particular cases Mr. Allighan andMr. Walkden disclosed information which they had acquired in the capacityof Members of Parliament as such. This does not exclude the possibility thatthere might be exceptional occasions on which to disclose for material rewardconfidential information relating to Parliamentary business acquired at a Partymeeting would be a breach of privilege. It would have, however, to be specificaTvrelated to actual proceedings of the House, e.g., the drafting of an amendmentof a Bill or of a Parliamentary Question, and not to a general discussion aboutParliamentary business. To go further would involve straining the precedents- even in the case of a Member &apos;s relations with his constituents he has not hitherto been regarded, for privilege purposes, as acting in his capacity as a Memberof Parliament and would, I suggest, be dangerous in various respects. Inparticular, there would be the risk that Party meetings and other privatemeetings of Members would attract to themselves other privileges which should properly belong only to Parliament as a whole or Committees of Parliament, or that it might seem that this was the objective. And, secondly, with all respectto the Committee of Privileges, it is difficult to draw a logical distinction betweenParty meetings in the precincts of the Palace of Westminster and Party meetingselsewhere, and between Party meetings and other private meetings of Members.9/. If this view is adopted by the Cabinet, it will be necessary to explain to the House the Government&apos;s reasons for differing from the Committee of privileges in these particular cases, but, on the other hand, I do not think thatwe need take a hard and fast line on the position of Party meetings. It willindeed be true to say that, while in our opinion these are not such cases, there might conceivably be cases where the disclosure for material reward of confi-dential information acquired at a Party meeting by a Member did constitute a breach of privilege.10. It does not follow that Mr. Allighan should go unpunished. As&apos;Sir Gilbert Campion points out, the Committee of Privileges found him guilty of (i) a libel upon the House and (ii) the acceptance of a bribe. In addition,they stated that these offences were aggravated by his evidence before them inwhich he sought to cast suspicion on others and persistently misled them (para-graph 23). It has often been held that wilfully misleading evidence is a sub-substantive offence, and by this conduct and by selling secrets, Mr. Allighan was undoubtedly guilty of disgraceful conduct likely to bring the House into contempt.
The question whether he was guilty of contempt by libel of the House is,in Sir Gilbert Campion&apos;s opinion, more difficult, but though he rejects the view on which the Committee based their finding, he seems to me to be right inconcluding that Mr. Allighan&apos;s article with its general imputations of dis-reputable behaviour in the precincts constitutes a contemptuous affront to thedignity of Parliament, and that, despite the absence of a precise precedent,the words complained of come under the principle of &quot; acts tending to obstruct the Houses in the performance of their functions by diminishing the respectdue to them.&quot;11. Mr. Walkden&apos;s offence was less aggravated, but essentially the samein so far that he was also guilty of betraying confidence for money.12. It remains to consider what punishments the House should be recom-mended to impose.   The possible punishments are :.-(i) Committal to Prison, or the Clock Tower,(ii) Reprimand or admonition.(iii) Suspension.(iv) Expulsion.The Committee recommend that Mr. Heighway should be reprimanded.Though I have suggested that he should be dealt with on rather different groundsfrom those proposed by the Committee, I think that the House should be advised to adopt this recommendation. The Committee make no recommendations as toMr. Allighan or Mr. Walkden but they are at pains to indicate that they regardMr. Allighan&apos;s contempt as much graver than Mr. Heighway&apos;s, and Mr. Allighanis, of course, held to have committed the additional breach of privilege in thenature of bribery.No Member has been committed for over a hundred years. The choice seemsto lie between a severe reprimand, a suspension and an expulsion. In the caseof Mr. Allighan a reprimand may seem something of an anti-climax, but a sus-pension is a punishment of the Member&apos;s constituents rather than of the Memberhimself, whilst an expulsion is obviously a remedy to be used only in the most exceptional circumstances. There will be some support for the imposition of thisextreme penalty (which results in an immediate vacation of the seat and a by-election in which the expelled Member is entitled to stand again) in the case ofMr. Allighan, but on the whole I incline to the view that it would be sufficientto recommend the House that Mr. Allighan be severely reprimanded and suspendedfrom the service of the House for a period (i.e., till after the Easter Recess, 1948)and that Mr. Walkden be reprimanded. It will be for the House to decide whether mr. Allighan&apos;s salary should also be suspended. No help can be obtained from the precedents since the last use of suspension as a punishment in this sense, as distinct from suspension under Standing Orders, goes back to 1692. In the case of suspension under Standing Orders the salary continues. One reason is that thesuspended Member can perform some of his Parliamentary duties, but in any casethe analogy is not a close one. The argument for suspending Mr. Allighan&apos;s salarywould presumably be that it would be anomalous that he should continue to drawit for doing nothing and that it would be appropriate that as he has profitedfinancially from his transactions with the press he should also suffer financially.I would, therefore, favour asking the House to decide on suspension of salary.13. As will be seen, Sir Gilbert Campion suggests the following draftMotions to meet Mr. Allighan&apos;s case : 1&quot; That the article written by Mr. Allighan, and published in the World&apos;press News of the 3rd April, 1947, in its general tone, and particularly by its unfounded imputations against unnamed Members of insobriety inthe precincts of the House, is an affront to this House; and that bothMr. Allighan, as the writer of the article, and Mr. Heighway, the editorand publisher of the World&apos;s Press News, are guilty of a gross contemptof this House.That Mr. Allighan, in persistently misleading the Committee of privileges in his evidence, and in seeking to cast suspicion on others inrespect of the very matter of which he knew himself to be guilty, hascommitted a grave contempt of this House.That Mr. Allighan, in corruptly accepting payment for the disclosure of information about Parliamentary matters obtained under the obligation of confidence, is guilty of dishonourable conduct which deserves to be severelypunished as tending to destroy mutual confidence among Members and tobring this House into contempt.&quot;34382b 2
This could be followed by a Motion (on the Paper, if desired) for his suspension-sion for the requisite period, and dealing with the suspension of his salary.Appropriate Motions would also be required as regards Mr. Walkden, and enabling the House to take into consideration the Reports of the Committee of privileges.14. If the views I have expressed above are correct, it would not be right that any further action should be taken against the journalists concerned exceptMr. Heighway, because they were not parties to the breaches of privilege. Itwould, however, be desirable that the House should give a warning to journalists Has to their future conduct in circumstances of this kind, and the House mightbe asked to agree to a Motion on the following lines : 1&quot; That, if in any case hereafter a Member shall have been found guiltyby the House of corruptly accepting payment for the disclosure and publica-tion of confidential information about Parliamentary matters, any personresponsible for offering such payment shall incur the grave displeasure ofthis House; and if such person shall be the representative of a newspaperor press agency, neither that person nor any other representative of the samenewspaper or agency shall be admitted within the precincts of this Houseuntil this House shall otherwise determine.&quot;15.   It remains to be added that whilst the matter is one on which theGovernment may properly advise the House it should be left to a free vote.16. I would also draw attention- to the Motion which has been tabled in the names of Mr. Piekthorn, Mr. H. G. Strauss and others, the effect of which is toremove doubt as to the scope of the jurisdiction exercised by the Committee of privileges and to make it clear that they must consider all relevant matters. the attorney-General tells me that the Committee have taken a rather narrow viewof their powers. Thus in the W. J. Brown case they felt that they were not entitled to suggest any general principles governing the contractual relationsbetween members and outside bodies and in the cases which are the subject ofthis paper they felt unable to discuss the position of the newspapers. the attorney thinks that this view is mistaken and inconvenient. I agree, and would suggest that the opportunity of the Motion for the appointment of the Committeeof Privileges for the 1947-48 Session should be taken to clarify the position.17. I ask my colleagues to agree that, while there should be free votes,I should advise the House, on behalf of the Government, in the sense of thismemorandum, and arrange for Motions to be put down on the lines suggested inparagraphs 12, 13, 14 and 16.H.

ANNEXCOMMITTEE. OF PRIVILEGES&apos; REPORT: CASE OF Mr. ALLIGHANConfidential Memorandum by the Clerk of the House of CommonsThis Note is confined for the sake of brevity to Mr. Allighan&apos;s case, which covers in principle that of Mr. Walkden.1. In my humble opinion the Committee&apos;s Report does not entirely dispose of the objections voiced by Lord Winterton, &amp;c. objections which may be raised in the House in a more effective form.2. It is true that the Committee do not endorse the &apos;&apos; arguable &apos;&apos; view that&quot; the publication of confidential information given for or obtained by payment,about the transactions at a private Party meeting could by analogy be treated as a breach of the rule against publication of parliamentary proceedings &apos;&apos; (para-graph 20). But they do find (i) that the imputation that Members regularlybetray the confidence of private Party meetings either for payment or whilst their discretion has been undermined by drink is a serious contempt&quot; (paragraph 8),and (ii) that &apos;&apos; the making of a payment in order that a Member should speciallynote what took place at the meeting (i.e., a private Party meeting) and should dis-clo^: information about it, or the acceptance of such a payment, constitutes a trans-action in the nature of bribery of a Member in regard to what is part of his work inParliament and is a breach of the privileges of this House &quot; (paragraph 21). (Itmay be convenient to mention here that &apos;&apos; contempt &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; breach of privilege &apos;&apos;are now practically interchangeable terms, though breach of privilege strictlymeans the infraction of a recognised privilege, e.g., an attempt to restrict aMember&apos;s freedom of speech.)3. The contempts or breaches of privilege of which the Committee findMr. Allighan guilty are, therefore, (i) a libel upon the House, and (ii) theacceptance of a bribe. In their conclusions they state (iii) that these offences wereaggravated by Mr. Allighan&apos;s evidence in which he sought to cast suspicion onothers and persistently misled the Committee (paragraph 23).4. Leaving aside (iii) for the moment, .1 cannot help feeling that a case which would be difficult to answer could be made against the Committee&apos;s findingsabout (i) and (ii-      the following lines .-&apos; 5. The basis ox the Committee&apos;s findings that both the libel and the corruptaction are breaches of privilege is, as the Committee themselves recognise, theview that Members attending &apos; private Party meetings held in the precincts ofthe Palace of Westminster during the parliamentary session to discuss par-liamentary matters connected with the current or future proceedings ofParliament &quot; are acting &quot; in their capacity as Members.&quot; This view is arguedout in paragraph 17 of the Report to support the conclusion that the libel is acontempt, and is relied upon in paragraph 21 of the Report to support theconclusion that the corrupt action is a breach of privilege. v6. This view is certainly indispensable to the findings of the Report. But,if it is accepted, its consequences, may be found to reach further than isanticipated in the Report. It must result in giving a privileged status in onerespect at least to private Party meetings, held as aforesaid. And this may prove to go far towards justifying the minority contention that it would enable a sectionof Members to clothe themselves with privileges which only belong to parliament as a whole, since, if the door is opened to one privilege it is hard to find a logicalreason for closing it to others. If there is still time, it should be carefully considered whether this view is well-founded and what its consequences are likelyto be.I. Is the view well-founded f7. Apart from the objections brought out in evidence that these meetingsare not parliamentary in any strict sense, not being appointed by the House orreporting to it, other persons besides Members of Parliament are admitted and business is transacted which does not relate to parliamentary proceedings.   The
same meeting may therefore have a different status when its business is concernedwith current or future proceedings of Parliament from what it has when its business is not so concerned.8. It should be noted that, according to the precedents, Members are onlyregarded as acting &apos;&apos; in the capacity of Members&apos;&apos; when they take part in parliamentary proceedings. For example, a Member in transactions outsideParliament with his constituents has never been regarded for purposes of privilege as acting in his capacity as a Member.9; The mere possibility of regarding the notion &apos;&apos; proceedings ofParliament&apos;&apos; as extending to the transactions of private party meetings is derivedfrom the Report of the Committee on the Official Secrets Acts, 1939, which, foralmost the first time in the history of Privilege in the British Parliament,extended the notion of proceedings of Parliament outside the House or one of its committees (paragraphs 4 to 7). In this, the &quot; Sandys case,&quot; what was assimi-lated to proceedings in Parliament was the draft of a Question which a Memberproposed to ask in the House, shown by the Member to a Minister. This was something which was a concrete bit of parliamentary business, or perhaps rather the first stage of such business. I cannot help thinking that it is a dangerousfurther extension to use the notion of parliamentary proceedings to cover whatis not in itself, and is not about to become, a bit of parliamentary business, but is only discussion about such business. If discussion about parliamentary business is to give a privileged status to private party meetings, why not to any casualgroup of Members, in the Library for instance, or the Dining Room, both of whichhave been regarded as necessary adjuncts to the work of Parliament for at least as long as private Party meetings ?II. What are the consequences of the Committee&apos;s views?10. Some consequences may be highly inconvenient. I will mention a fewthat occur to me : -(1) The inconvenience of a private party meeting being privileged when itis discussing parliamentary business but not privileged whendiscussing its own organisation, for instance, has already been mentioned.(2) A private Party meeting is privileged, according to the Report, whensitting in the precincts of the House. But if it finds it more convenient to sit at Transport House or in the Carlton Club, while transactingthe same business as it did on a previous day when sitting in theprecincts, it will not be privileged. The status of the body will be entirely transformed by a purely extraneous circumstance.(3) However much the Committee may deprecate the inference that &apos;&apos; this conclusion attracts to such meetings all the privileges which are attached to the transactions of Parliament as a whole&quot; (para-graph 17), it would prove difficult in practice, while admitting oneprivilege, to exclude others which are relevant to &quot; proceedings inParliament&quot; or to &quot;Members acting in a parliamentary capacity.&quot;The Committee admit two &quot;breaches of privilege,&quot; libel andcorruption. It is hard to see how they could logically exclude aprivilege which attaches to proceedings in Parliament protection against being sued for defamation of character.(4) It would be tempting for a Member if he had to defend an action forslander in respect of words used by him at a private party meeting,which sat in the Palace of Westminster and was dealing at the time with current or future proceedings in the House, to claim the privilege of freedom of speech attaching to proceedings in Parliament on thestrength of the Committee &apos;s Report. Whether such a plea would beaccepted by the Courts is doubtful. If it were not, a clash would arise between Parliament and the Courts of a kind which has been carefully avoided since the case of Stockdale v. Hansard more thana hundred years ago.(5) The betrayal of confidential information is not confined to meetings ofthe Labour Party. Sir D. Maxwell-Fyfe and Lord Winterton saidthat the same trouble was encountered in their own Party. would it not become rather a reductio ad absurdum if not only the chief
Opposition Party, but any small group could hold up the programmeof business of the House in order to settle internal troubles of thiskind under the guise of a breach of privilege?11. For the reasons stated, it is my opinion, for what it is worth, thatno breach of privilege in any strict sense of the terms has been committed on thelines indicated in the Committee&apos;s Report. On the other hand, I think thatMr. Allighan has committed a breach of privilege of a different kind and thathis conduct in receiving money for the betrayal of confidential information,though not strictly a breach of privilege, could and should be punished.12. The breach of privilege or contempt, actually committed byMr. Allighan was, in my view, committed in his evidence before the Committee-It is briefly described in paragraphs 23 and 24 of the Report, but is theretreated as an &quot;aggravation &quot; of his offence. It has often been held that wilfullymisleading evidence&apos;is a substantive offence (May 109) and this was a particu-larly bad case. For, as the Committee observe, Mr. Allighan was &apos;&apos; seeking to cast suspicion on others in respect of the very matter of which he knew himself to be guilty.&apos;&apos; Such conduct would warrant a heavy penalty by itself. Takenin connection with his selling of secrets, I think the House would agree thatsuspension for the term suggested by the Lord President would not be too severea penalty.13. With regard to the finding of the Committee of Privileges thatMr. Allighan&apos;s article in the World Press News was an unfounded imputationon Members involving &quot;an affront to the House&quot; and constituting a &quot;seriouscontempt&quot; (paragraph 18), I find it very difficult to express an opinion. On thewhole, I agree with the statement by itself, but disagree with the view on whichit is based (paragraph 17), that view being *the one which I have alreadycriticised, namely, that Members attending private Party meetings held in theprecincts are acting &quot; in their capacity as Members.&quot; But the article complained of is not confined exclusively to the betrayal of the secrets of private Partymeetings. It contains more general imputations about Members &apos;&apos; leakingaround the bar,&quot; being lubricated into loquacity,&quot; &amp;c. imputations of dis-reputable behaviour in the precincts which are calculated, the Members not beingnamed, to bring the House as a whole into contempt,, and also to disparage theHouse for tolerating such conduct in the premises which it controls. Upon thesemore general grounds, and in view of the whole tone of the article, I shouldbe inclined to hold that the article constitutes a contemptuous affront to thedignity of Parliament. I have come to this opinion with some hesitation as itis not supported by any precisely analogous case, but I think, on the whole, thatthe words complained of come under the principle of &quot; acts tending to obstruct the &quot;Houses in the performance of their functions by diminishing the respect dueto them &quot; (May 116). If this view is not acceptable, I do not see on what groundsMr. iUlighan can be held guilty of a contempt by libel of the House, and in that case, of course, Mr. Heighway, the editor, is not guilty either and cannot bereprimanded.14. But how is the corrupt betrayal of confidence to be brought home toMr. Allighan if it was not &quot; conduct.in his capacity as a Member &quot; ? The Househas the unchallenged right to discipline its own Members for conduct which,although not conduct in their &quot; capacity as Members,&quot; falls seriously below thestandard which the House expects from its Members. The most usual case, ofcourse, is expulsion when a Member has been convicted and sentenced formisdemeanour, e.g., Horatio Bottomley&apos;s case. It is true that the penalty of suspension has not been imposed, except under the standing order relating to&quot; Order in Debate,&quot; since 1692. But there is no substantial reason, as in thecase of fining, why the House should not impose it at its discretion, and a speaker&apos;s ruling in 1877 recognised that the House could impose it for contempt.15. On the other hand, I do not see how penal proceedings can be taken against the journalists implicated in the charge of bribery. If my view is correctthat Mr. Aliighan was not acting in his parliamentary capacity in taking paymentfrom them, they are not guilty of any true breach of privilege in offering payment.The House has not the same power to discipline strangers as. it has over its ownMembers. I should hold that no action can be taken against them in the present case.  At most a warning can be given for the future.16. If it is decided to recommend the view that Mr. Allighan is guilty ofa libel on the House on the more general grounds mentioned in paragraph 13
