There aretwelve recommendations of principle, eleven of which weresigned unanimously by the eleven members and the twelfth by-nine of them.    These are followed by a plan for the&apos; partition of Palestine signed by seven members of the Committee.    three members put forward an alternative proposal for the establishmentof a Federal State.    The eleventh member, the Australian, hasnot. associated himself with either of these plans.The General recommendations.     The most important of the twelve general recommendations are the first and second, tc the effect that the Mandate forPalestine should be terminated and independence granted inPalestine at the earliest practicable date.3.     The sixth general principle is also noteworthy.   Thisrecommends that the General Assembly should immediately initiatean international arrangement whereby the problem of the distressed European Jews would be dealt v/ith as a matterof urgency &quot;for the alleviation of their plight and of thePalestine   problem&quot;.   With this is connected the twelfthgeneral recommendation, sighed by nine members, stating that&quot;any solution for Palestine cannot be considered as a solutionof the Jewish problem in general&quot;..
The Majority Plan - Partition4.     Seven members have signed a recommendation for partitionon lines shown in a map circulated with the Report,    salient features of this plan are:-(i) His Majesty&apos;s&apos;Government would be responsiblefor carrying it out.    (There is provisionfor the assistance of His Ma jesty&apos;s . government by one or more members of the United Nations,but the members in question are not specified).The period of transition for which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be responsible is two years,though it is clearly implied that an extensionmight be necessary,(ii) During this period of transition, 150,000 jewish immigrants would be admitted.    Should theperiod be prolonged, Jewish immigration wouldbe allowed at&apos; the rate of 60,000 a year.(iii) The frontiers drawn by the :authors of this planare more favourable to. the Jews and moreunfavourable to the Arabs^than those drawn in any partition plan which has at any time been&apos; contemplated by His Majesty&apos;s Government,The present population in the area, allocated tothe Jewish State consists of approximately500,000 Jews and 500,000 non-Jews, mainly Arab,(The latter figure includes Bedouin),(iv) The independence of the two States would not berecognised by the United Nations until theyhad concluded a treaty of economic union.It is, however, provided that, if only oneState fulfils the various conditions of independence, including readiness to sign the economic treaty, &quot;the General Assemblyof   the United Nations shall take such action as it may   deem appropriate&quot;,(v) The City of Jerusalem, with a small&apos;area aroundit, is to be placed under the directadministration of the United Nations,    Itwould be included in the economic union ofPalestine,The Minority Plan - Federation5.     A minority of three members advocate a Federal State,with preponderant power in the hands of the Federal Government.The boundaries  of.the Arab and Jewish States (which would in fact be little more  than provinces) are shown on a map already circulated.    The following are salient features of this plan:&apos; (i) There would be&apos; a three year period of transition,in which, the country would be administered by &quot;an authority to be decided   by theGeneral Assembly&quot;,
(ii) During the period of transition, immigrationwould he permitted into the Jewish area ata rate not-exceeding its absorptive capacity.This rate would be determined not by the administering authority but by a commissioncomposed of three Arab and three jewish representatives together with .three nomineesof the United Nations,(iii) The single Constituent Assembly which is envisaged under this plan would have towork within the limits laid down in aseries of general provisions, of whichthe most important are the following:(a) Immigration would be controlled by thecentral Government.(b) The right of residence would be ^accorded by the local Governments.(c) The central institutions would include a bicameral legislature.One of the two chambers would be elected in such a way as to giveproportional representation tothe population as a wholej    in theother there would be parity of numbers between the Jewish and Arabrepresentatives.    Legislation wouldrequire the approval of a majority in both chambers.(d) In the event of deadlock resultingfrom this legislative system, theissue would be submitted to an arbitralbody of five members, &quot;including notless than two Arabs and two Jews&quot;.Although the allegiance of the fifthmember, who would in fact be the finallegislative authority in many mattersof major importance, is not explicitlystated, it is clear from the provisionsmade for his election that he would almost certainly be an Arab.    Thusdeadlocks resulting from conflict alongcommunal lines (e.g.  over immigration)would be resolved in favour of theArabs.(iv) The Head of State, who would be elected by amajority vote of both legislative chambers,would have a deputy who must be a member of thecommunity other than his own - an Arab if he were a. Jew and a Jew if he were an Arab,(v) Jerusalem would be the Capital of the Federal State.There would, however, be a permanent international commission for the supervision and protection ofthe Holy places.Position of His Majesty&apos;s Government inrelation to Assembly recommendationsS&quot; 4.uThQ rePort of the Special Committee will now be consideredoy the General Assembly, where a two-thirds majority willDe required for the adoption of a recommendation. .-3-
7.     His Majesty&apos;s Government are not at present committed to accepting, still less to carrying out with their own resources,such recommendations as the Assembly may make.   At the special,session of the Assembly last spring, Sir Alexander Cadogandrew a distinction between accepting a recommendation, in the sense of not impeding its execution by others, and activelycarrying it out by means of-a British administration and British,forces.   At the same time he&apos; reserved our right to declinethe task of implementing proposals which would demand the useof force and which could not be reconciled with our conscience.While making an explicit-reservation on this point only,Sir Alexander did not commit us even to passive acceptance ofthe Assembly&apos;s recommendations.   Nevertheless we shouldpresumably not -wish&apos;to obstruct on Assembly recommendation by refusing to accept it.    The crucial question will be itsenforcement, and it is with this that the following paragraphsar e c one e rned.Enforcement of the majority plan8.     The majority proposal is so manifestly -unjust to theArabs that it is difficult to see how, in Sir Alexander Cadogan&apos;swords &quot;we could reconcile it with our conscience&quot;.    Thereare also strong reasons of expediency for declining theresponsibility for giving effect to this proposal.    The attemptto do so would precipitate an Arab rising in Palestine whichwould have the moral approval of the entire Moslem world andwould be more or less actively, supported by the neighbouring arab States.    The Chiefs of Staff state that, in this situation,reinforcements amounting to not less than one division wouldhove to be sent to the Middle East,9.     The long-term political and strategic consequences would be more serious than the immediate military problem.We should be engaged in suppressing Arab resistance in Palestine,and thus antagonising the independent Arab States,- at a timewhen our whole political and strategic system in the middle east must be founded on co-operation with those States.   Thetreaty rights which would probably be accorded to us by theJewish State would be poor compensation for the loss of Arabgoodwill and with it of our prospect of establishing that firmstrategic hold on the Middle East which is an indispensiblepart of Commonwealth defence policy.10.   In answer to these considerations it might at first sightbe argued that, once the operation of partition was completed,we could rely on time to heal the wound, so that after an interval Anglo-Arab relations would no longer be affected.    This,however, would be an unduly - optimistic forecast.- - It wouldprobably not be long before the Jewish Government, faced as itwould be in the course of time with a problem of over-population and driven by the ultra-nationalist political parties whichwill not accept partition as a final settlement, would try to expand its frontiers.    If Jewish irredentism is likely to developafter an interval, Arab irredentism is certain from the outset.Partition would establish a. miniature State, under a JewishGovernment but with a relatively very large Arab minority,entirely surrounded by Arab territory.    It seems reasonable to suppose that the Arab population of this State would play apart in history not unlike that of the Sudeten German minority in pre-war Czechoslovakia,    Thus the existence of a Jewish Statemight prove to be a constant factor of unrest in the middle east, and this could hardly fail to have a damaging effect on anglo-Arab relations.
-11..   It is suggested, in the plan under consideration, that other Governments might he associated with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in carrying out partition.   Even if this were possible, which seems doubtful, it would not greatly affectthe issue.    On a short view, Arab sympathies would be no less alienated from Great Britain,   And on a long view,Britishinterests more than any others would suffer from the newelement of discord introduced into Middle Eastern politics.Enforcement of an alternative plan of partition12..  The principle of partition is distinct- from any particularapplication of it, and adjustments could be made in the mapproposed by the majority of the Committee which would,principally by reducing the size&apos;of the Arab minority in theJewish State, eliminate much of the injustice of the present plan.    But these adjustments would have to be very substantialindeed before they had any appreciable effect on the Arabreaction to partition.   And long before that point was reachedthey would provoke a Jewish refusal to accept it.    Now thatthe appetite of their followers has been whetted by the majorityplan, the Zionist leaders cannot accept much less.13.   Thus, if the Assembly were to adopt partition in a formintrinsically more jixst than that now proposed, the probableresult would be that any Power attempting to give effect toit would be faced simultaneously with, an Arab rising and large-scale Jewish terrorism.    This would create the most difficult of all possible situations in the short run.    nor would the revision of the boundaries of the Jewish State greatlyaffect the long-term consequences of its establishment,    a jewish Government would not be- able to regulate immigrationin accordance with a realistic assessment of their territory&apos;economic absorptive capacity.    The desire for expansion might develop earlier if the Jewish State&apos; occupied a smaller area and would be felt more strongly if the Jews were dissatisfied with the frontiers.Enforcement of the minority planliu   Despite their objections to the minority proposal fora federal State, primarily on the grounrl that it does not altogether close the door to eventual partition,  the Arabs mightbe persuaded, to acquiesce in this solution.    To the Jews onthe other hand it is totally unacceptable.    An attempt to giveeffect to it would therefore be followed by an intensification of Jewish, terrorism.    On these assumptions the Chiefs of Staffconsider that no reinforcements would be needed;    in view,however, of the planned run-down of our forces in the Middle East,a point would shortly be reached at which the necessary strengthcould be maintained only at the expense of some other commitment,15.   The main difficulty, however, in the way of the minorityplan is that,  since it involves the willing co-operation of thetwo peoples,  it is not capable of being enforced.   Many detailsin this plan are borrowed from the two sets of proposals whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government successively laid before the PalestineGonference in London last winter.    But it was assumed at thattime that the proposals would not be practicable unless they received some measure of consent from both Arabs and Jews.
16.    It therefore seems probable that, if the Assembly were toadopt the minority plan, any Power accepting the responsibilityfor giving- effect to it would not obtain a sufficient measure of .co-operation and would thus be unable to extricate itself from palestine after the three year period of transition.Withdrawal from Palestine&apos;17.    It appears from the preceding paragraphs that, gravedisadvantages would follow&apos; from, a decision by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to undertake the task of carrying out any of the.three solutions which the Assembly may be expected to consider.If these disadvantages ore held to preclude acceptance ofresponsibility for any of the-three, solutions, His Majesty&apos;s&apos;Government must be prepared for an alternative course of action.This would be equally necessary in the somewhat similarsituation which would be created by a failure of the assembly to carry any resolution whatever by the necessary two-thirds majority.18,    The present situation in Palestine is intolerable and cannot be allowed to continue.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have themselves failed to devise any settlement which would enablethem to transfer their authority to a. Government representing .the inhabitants of the country.    If the Assembly should fail,or if it were to propose a settlement for which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could not accept responsibility, the only remainingcourse would be to withdraw from Palestine,  in the last resortunconditionally.19.    The threat of British withdrawal within a specified time,coupled with an offer to assist in giving effect to any agreement reached between the Arabs and the Jews before our departure,might conceivably have the result of inducing them to co-operate in order to avoid the otherwise inevitable civil war.    But a withdrawal, if decided upon, should not be made conditional onsuch an agreement.20.    Withdrawal in the absence of Arab-Jewish agreement hasdisadvantages which should not be underestimated.    There wouldbe an interval between the announcement of our intention towithdraw and the actual withdrawal, an interval in which thetask of the Administration might be more difficult than in any previous period.    In the absence of a Government to which power could be transferred, the consequences of our evacuation wouldhe unpredictable.    Some or all of the Arab States would probablybecome involved in the resulting disorders;    they might evenquarrel among themselves over the country&apos;s future.    In any event it is likely that the situation would before long be broughtto the. attention of the Security Council,.21.    On the other hand our withdrawal from Palestine, even if ithad to be effected at the cost of a period of bloodshed and chaosin the country, would have two major advantages.    British liveswould not be lost, nor British resources expended, in suppressingone Palestinian community for the advantage of the other.   And(at least as compared with enforcing the majority plan or avariant of it) we should not be pursuing a policy destructiveof our own interests, in the Middle East.
S.B.Foreign Office, S.W.1.18TH SEPTEMBER,  19^7,)22.      If we were to leave Palestine in this way we should nodoubt be accused by both Jews and Arabs of having failed to fulfil our obligations to them, deriving from the Mandateor from general principles of political justice.    The forceof the accusation, however, would be greatly weakened by:(a) the record of our repeated efforts to arriveat a settlementj(b) our offer &apos;tb stand aside and allow theUnited Nations to implement a policy;(c) our offer to abide by and facilitate any agreement arrived at by the Arabs and Jewsthemselves.We cannot permit ourselves to be kept in Palestine indefinitelyby the fear of this accusation.   We have already stated,in the document which we presented to the London Conferencelast February, that &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government are notprepared to continue indefinitely.to govern Palestine ^themselves merely because Arabs and Jews cannot agree upon     ;the means of sharing its government between them&quot;.    It shouldalso be remembered that each of the other suggested -policieswould expose us to the same charge from either Jews or Arabs.RE C OMMBNDA TIONS23.    Once it has been decided that, failing a satisfactory settlement, we are determined to withdraw British Forces and.British administration from Palestine in the near future,we should clearly announce this intention in such a way as toderive the maximum possible advantage from it.    Nothing short of an..;announcement of our determination to withdraw rather than to carry out an unacceptable policy will induce a sense ofrealism and offer a prospect of a settlement.    With this end in view, it should be made clear at an early stage in theAssembly that our minds are made up.    (See Annex for the draftof a statement on these lines).2L\..-   There, is a chance that the effect of this announcementmay be sufficient to produce a solution (either by a recommendation of the Assembly or by direct agreement betweenthe Arabs and the Jews) for which His Majesty&apos;s Government would feel justified in accepting responsibility.25.   We must however be prepared, should there be no prospectof this when-the present Assembly ends, to make a further statement announcing the date on which&apos; British Forces and theCivil Administration would be withdrawn from Palestine&apos;.    Inmaking this statement, we should also renew our offer ofBritish assistance tp the Arabs and Jews for the purpose of facilitating any settlement on which they were able to reach agreement before we left the country.- &apos;
annex draft OP STATEMENT TO BE INCLUDED INSPEECH BY UNITED KINGDOM DELEGATE TOTHE PALESTINE COMMITTEE OF THE GENERAL assembly the recommendations made to the Assembly by the SpecialCommittee on Palestine are .of two kinds.    There are twelverecommendations of a general character, eleven of which are put forward unanimously and the twelfth by a substantial majorityof the Committee.    These are followed by two detailed proposalsfor the future Government of Palestine, one supported by amajority of seven members and the other by a majority of three.2,     With the twelve general recommendations the United KingdomGovernment are in substantial agreement.    I. wish in particular to endorse and emphasise three *f these statements of principle.The first and the second, recommending the termination of the mandate;and the grant of independence in Palestine at.the earliest practicable date, are an exact expression of the&quot; guiding principleof British policy in Palestine.    This should be sufficientlyobvious from the record of our various attempts to secure agree-racnt on a final settlement -of tho problem.   Nevertheless I takethe opportunity of re-affirming.that in this fundamental natterthe aims of ray Government and of tjho Special Committee- are identical.3e     The other general recommendation to which I wish to draw the Committee^ attention is the sixth, to the effect that theGeneral Assembly should immediately undertake the initiation and execution of an international arrangement to deal with the problemof distressed European Jews as a matter of extreme urgency.    Itis the opinion of the United Kingdom Government that the entireproblem of displaced persons in Europe, Jewish and non-Jewishalike, is an internatonal responsibility and one which demandsurgent action.   We shall make prop jsals to this end on a more appropriate,  occasion.h,      3L have said enough to show that there is no conflict betweenthe general conclusions reached by the Special Committee and the broad objectives of British policy.   We approach the subjectof Palestine and its related -problems in the same spirit.5.     As regards the future Government of Palestine it was made clear at the special session, by Sir Alexander Cadogan, that theUnited Kingdom Government, would be in the highest degree reluctant to oppose the AssemblyTs virishes.    He went on, &quot;however, to draw a distinction between accepting a recommendation, in the sense ofnot impeding its execution by others, and actively carrying it out by means of a British administration and British forces.6.      The attitude of my Government remains the same.    It is hardly necessary for rne to emphasise bur readiness to co-operate with the Assembly to the fullest possible extent, and I cannoteasily imagine circumstances in which we should wish to preventthe application of a settlement recommended by the Assembly.The crucial question is its enforcement, and on this I must dwelllittle longer.
7.     The United. Kingdom Government are ready to assume theresponsibility for giving effect to any plan on which agreement is reached between the Arabs and Jews.    They are not themselvesprepared to undertake the task of imposing a policy in Palestineby force of arms.    In considering any proposal to the effect thatthey should participate with others&apos; in the enforcement of asettlement they must take into account both the inherent justice of the settlement and the extent to which force would be requiredto give effect to it,,80 - If the Assembly should.recommend a policy which the United &apos;Kingdom Government would not feel able to implement, it would benecessary to provide for some alternative authority to implementit. In that event, the United Kingdom Government would be readyto hand over the administration of Palestine to any authoritydesignated by the Assembly as soon as that authority declareditself in a position to assume full responsibility.9.     I have intervened in the discussion today because theCommittee has before it a proposa?. involving certain assumptionsconcerning the future attitude of my Government, and the Committeeis therefore entitled to know how far. those assumptions are .justified.10.    In conclusion, and in order &quot;that there may be no misunder- -standing of our attitude and policy, I ha^e been instructed byHis Majesty1 s Government to state-with all solemnity that,, ifit proves impossible as a result of the deliberations of theGeneral Assembly to reach a settlement $ His Majesty ?s Governmentwill be forced to base their policy on the assumption that theywill have to surrender the mandate under which they have sought for twenty five years to discharge their obligations to facilitate the growth of a Jewish National Home and to protect the interestsof the Arabij population.    This task has now become impossible,and in the absence of a settlement His Majesty5s Government mustplan for an early withdrawal of British forces;,and of the british administration from Palestine..
