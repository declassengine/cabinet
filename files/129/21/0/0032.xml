::: -ANNEX I    ; J:;f;;:;;   : V \:. N&apos;;Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of ParliamentDuring the Session whidh is now concluding substantial progress has beenmade in the work of reconstruction, but the economic difficulties resulting fromthe war, both at home and abroad, have presented My Ministers with serious problems and have required continuing efforts and sacrifices by My people. Toenable My Ministers to deal rapidly and effectively with these problems, a measurehas been enacted extending the purposes for which emergency powers can be used,and a new organisation for economic planning has been established. In order tosecure a redistribution of labour to assist those industries which are essential to continue recovery, My Government have reintrodueed a measure of control overthe engagement of labour, supported by some limited use of the power of directionof workers.2. My Ministers have given unremitting attention to the serious deficit inthe overseas balance of payments and to the continuing need to stimulate exports and limit imports. In order to protect our reserves of gold and foreign exchange,it has been necessary temporarily to suspend the convertibility of sterling. my government have been fully aware that our own difficulties cannot be overcomeexcept in conjunction with other Governments. They have, therefore, warmly welcomed the initiative of the United States in seeking to promote joint action by the Governments of the European nations to increase production and extendinternational trade, and they have given this initiative their full support.3. My Government have continued to give full support to the united nations in the task of promoting international understanding and co-operation.They have played a leading part in establishing the Trusteeship Council andhave continued to share fully in the deliberations of the Economic and social council and of the International Labour Organisation and other specialised agencies. They have also put forward proposals for defining and safeguarding the fundamental liberties which it is the right of all peoples to enjoy.4. A Treaty of Alliance has been concluded with the Government of theFrench Republic.5. My Ministers have persisted in their efforts to establish true democracyin Germany, and they have approved the establishment of popularly electedregional Governments in the British Zone and encouraged a gradual transfer ofpowers to the German people.6. Treaties of Peace with Italy, Roumania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Finlandhave been signed and brought into force, and My Government have thus beenenabled to resume diplomatic relations with those countries7. Ministers from the United Kingdom have attended a Conference ofMinisters and other representatives of My several Governments held in Canberra,at the invitation of My Government in the Commonwealth of Australia. this conference resulted in a valuable exchange of views on problems likely to arise in the drawing up of a Peace Treaty with Japan.8. The Queen and I were deeply moved by the warmth of the welcomewhich We received throughout Our visit to South Africa, and will alwaystreasure the happiest memories of Our journey.9. It is with very great pleasure that I have given My consent to the engagement of My beloved daughter, Elizabeth, to Lieutenant PhilipMountbatten. F
10. In July I assented to the Indian Independence Act under which on15th August two new Dominions, India and Pakistan, came into being. Thuswas brought to fruition the declared policy of Parliament, that the peoples ofBritish India should achieve complete autonomy within the British Common-wealth. I trust that the relations between India and Pakistan and the othermembers of the British Commonwealth will prove to be warm and lasting.11. The relationship which had so long subsisted between Us and the ruling Princes of India has inevitably also changed. I acknowledge withgratitude the loyalty and devotion of the Indian Rulers to Myself and to MyRoyal predecessors and I hope that in association with India or Pakistan theirties with the Commonwealth will endure. -12. I remember gratefully the services of all those men and women whohave served the Crown in India and all those who have given their best in theservice of the peoples of India; particularly I am mindful of the faithful andgallant services of the men of My Indian Forces in time of war.13. In Burma the Executive Council has become the Provisional Governmentand a Constituent Assembly, elected in April, has drawn up a new constitution for Burma [as an independent country],14. It gives Me much pleasure to record that self-Government in internal affairs has been restored to Malta, that gallant island whose signal, contributionto the common cause in the late war has been a source of pride to us all.: 15. Delegates chosen by the legislatures of My possessions in the Caribbeanhave discussed the question of the closer association of those, territories. I am confident that this Conference will contribute to the progress and well-being ofMy peoples in this valued section of the British community of nations.16, My Government have referred the. question of. the future status ofPalestine to the United Nations, whose recommendations are now awaited as theresult of the present discussions in the Assembly.. Meanwhile they have maqe itclear that, in the absence, of a settlement, they must plan for an early withdrawalof British Forces and of the British Administration from Palestine..;17. At the invitation of My Government in the United Kingdom, aconference of representatives of British Commonwealth Governments in the sterling area has been held in London to discuss questions of common interestarising out of the general financial situation.18. , My Government have taken an active part in the discussions preparatoryto an International Conference on Trade and Employment- I hope that these efforts will assist the expansion of international trade and will create world conditions favouring its further expansion and the maintenance of a high and stable level of employment ip, all countries.Members of the House of Commons :19.

In many parts of the world My... Forces continue to make their contribution to: the maintenance of order and&apos; the restoration of peacefulconditions; their devotion to duty and the forbearance displayed in many difficult and trying circumstances is deserving of the highest praise.
22.   Despite their responsibilities overseas and the many tasks at home  \arising from the aftermath of war, the progress of demobilisation has brought the total number of men and women released from the Forces since June, 1945,to about four and three-quarter millions.  The resettlement in civil life of thosereleased has been continued with success.23. The National Service Acts have been amended to provide for the continuation of national service for a further period of five years from31st December, 1948.24. The exceptionally severe winter weather, followed by unprecedentedfloods, inflicted grievous damage on agriculture. In order to mitigate the losses sustained, My Government contributed to the Lord Mayor&apos;s National FloodDistress Fund and to the Agricultural Disaster Fund, and a measure was passed to provide special assistance to farmers cropping abnormally flooded land andrebuilding depleted flocks.25. Steps have been taken to provide the additional teachers and the accommodation required as a result of the raising of the school leaving age, and facilities for enabling promising students, to obtain university and advancededucation have been increased. The Universities are responding actively to thedemand for an expansion of their activities and they have been aided by largely increased grants from the Exchequer.26. Substantial progress has been made in the diversification of industryin Scotland and the work of Scottish hydro-electric schemes has been advanced.An Advisory Panel for the Highlands has been set up, and an enlargedprogramme of afforestation is proceeding.27.
