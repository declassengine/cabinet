/(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GO VEPJMENT)S E ORE TNegotiations for a treaty with Burma to regulate thetransfer of power have been progressing satisfactorily.      Thefinancial and. commercial clauses are still unsettled.     They&quot;are under discussion with the Finance Mission headed by  Tin Tut which had just reached this country.      If, as I &apos;hope, agreement Is reached upon them in the next week or so,all the clauses of the Treaty will have been agreed, and theTreaty will be ready for signature, by the middle of October.2.      In Burma the Constituent Assembly have now completed&apos;the drafting of the new Constitution for an independent Burma.They have also elected a provisional president and a provisional prime Minister.     The new constitution Is to comeinto force on the day appointed by&apos;&quot;the United Kingdom legisla-tion for the transfer of power - probably about a month afterthe date of the Royal Assent to the Bill.      the provisionalPresident and the provisional prime Minister (Thakin Nu, thepresent Prime Minister8) will also take office on that day.3.     The Assembly have chosen Thakin Nu to proceed to thiscountry as sole plenipotentiary to sign the treaty on behalfof the provisional Government of Burma.     If the negotiationsreferred to in paragraph 1 above are completed in time,  itis hoped that signature will take place on 17th October.km      The Treaty contains ii clause recognising the independence of Burma.   &quot;&apos; It will also provide for an exchange of ratifica-tions on the &quot;appointed day&quot; referred to in paragraph 2 above,and the Treaty will come into force, once those ratificationshave been exchanged.      It is understood that the Burmanspropose to seek a formal vote of approval for the Treaty fromthe Constituent Assembly on the &quot;appointed day&quot;, immediatelyprior to the exchange of ratifications.5.      I invite my colleagues to give their general approval,to arrangements on these lines which I have reason to supposeare acceptable to the Burmans.      They will see that theposition of parliament has been fully safeguarded since theTreaty will in terms make it clear that the transfer of power will, not take effect until the day appointed for the purpose by the United Kingdom legislation.      In other words the ratification and coming into operation of the Treaty itselfwill be contingent on the passing of the necessary legislation by Parliament.      on the Burman side arrangements have beenin fact made for the present, government to continue and theywill have fortified themselves by&apos; a vote of approval from theConstituent Assembly before ratifying the Treaty.CP.
