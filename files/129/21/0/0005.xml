Memo ran durai. The supreme importance of &quot;balance of paymentsquestions makes necessary some recasting of our existing organisation.     There are four main jobs to be done:-(i)    The immediate task is to conduct negotiations with every important country to secure our supplies.     these negotiations will have to cover finance and trade, and the negotiators will have to. use every possible bargaining counter,  including the availability and allocation of exports from the United Kingdom.      Moreover, while the negotiations&apos;will be conducted bilaterally,  they must be directedaccording to a single plan and with an eye on our needs and resources viewed as a whole.      Thus, part of the job will bethe preparation of a programme for our balance of payments as a whole, drawing on the data which will be furnished by those responsible for planning our outgoings (under (ii) below),our income from exports (under (iii).below) and the financial,items (invisible,  drawing dovm reserves, borrowing etc.) whichbalance the account,(ii)    The second task is the established procedure forbalance of payments control, namely determination andprogressing of the half-yearly import programme;    the scrutiny of import requirements, overseas government expenditure and invisible imports.(iii)    The third task concerns the export drive, e.g.the determination and progressing of export targets;    the division of output between home and export, and generalexport problems.(iv)    Finally, there is the need for planning adjustments in our internal economy consequential on the needs of our overseas trading.      This planning falls under two heads:-(a) the preparation of a long-term plan;(b) the short-term planning problems.2. How should these tasks be tackled? -   .(i)    Overseas negotiations.     We have no organisationcapable of handling this task.      &quot;What is. needed is a new committee which, in the ensuing weeks or months, would haveto be in pretty continuous session and would have to actvery quickly.      Its chairman should be full-time on this work.     Departmental representatives, who would probably beat about the Under-Secretary level, would not be whole-time since they must be the people with the executive responsibility for this work in their Departments.     But itshould be so arranged that they can give the Committee, sofar as possible, the first &quot;call on their time, and the aim should be continuity of membership.      Representatives of thefollowing would form the essential nucleus of the Committee:-
TreasuryBoard of TradeForeign office commonwealth Relations office ministry of FoodBank of England.For general questions, representatives ofEconomic Section of the Cabinet OfficeCentral Economic Planning Sectionwould attend.     Representatives of -Colonial office ministry of transport ministry of supply ministry of Fuel and Powerand of other Departments would also attend as required where their interests were affected.(ii)    Programme of expenditure.      The present machinerycentres on the Exchange Requirements Committee (TreasuryChairman) which handles the programmes of\imports on government account and reviews estimates of imports on private account.      Administrative decisions with regard tothe latter are taken &quot;by the Import Licensing Committee(Board of Trade Chairman).      This machinery needsstrengthening.     The scope of the Exchange requirements committee should be enlarged to cover the programming of   -all overseas expenditure, including -(a) imports on Government account, as at present;(b) imports on private account;    these would continueto be handled by the Import Licensing Committee, with a rather strengthened membership in close liaison with theExchange Requirements Committee;,       (c)    other overseas Governmental expenditure,particularly expenditure by the Services which has not so far been subject to the same systematic programmingand control;(d)    other invisibles,  including capitalexpenditure,  so far as they can be programmed.      these have hitherto been controlled, rather than programmedby the Treasury, acting in some cases through theExchange Control Committee, which would continue itspresent functions, in close liaison with&apos;the Exchange.Requirements Committee.The Exchange Requirements Committee, once it hasbeen given these wider responsibilities, should have amembership of a higher level than at present.
(iii)    Export Drive.      There are already an Export GuidanceWorking Party and an Export Targets Committee.      ThePresident of the Board of Trade proposes to set up a more powerful Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Secretaryfor Overseas Trade,  to supervise the export drive.      TheExport Guidance Working Party&apos;s functions will be absorbed by the new Overseas Negotiations Committee under (i);but machinery will be required for securing the directionof exports in accordance with bargains made with othercountries.      The Export Targets Committee will have functionsof increased importance in determining the total volume,and the make up by commodities, of our exports.      Therelations between this Committee and the new Committee whichis to supervise the export drive remain to be worked out.(iv)    Planning.      The task mentioned in paragraph l(.iv)above falls within the scope of the Central Economic planning staff.3. The work of these four bodies interlocks and overlapsand needs to be brought together into a single focus.     But thevolume of work to be done is so great that it must be split up,and the division of functions suggested above seems to be themost workmanlike that can be suggested.h. In order to bring the work of these four bodiestogether,  it is suggested -(a) That they should all work under the aegis of the steering Committee, which would have ultimate responsibilityfor advising Ministers on balance of payments questions as awhole;    and that arrangements should be made for the chairmen of the committees to attend meetings of the Steering Committee.(A senior official of the Board of Trade will be appointedVice-chairman of the new Committee on Exports and he will represent the (Ministerial) Chairman of that Committee at meetings of the Steering Committee).(b) That the chairmen of the committees should work outarrangements for day-to-day co-ordination between themselves.(c) That there should be some common membership of thecommittees.(d) That there should be arrangements for a full-timejoint secretariat of the various committees drawn from theCabxn et Office,  the Treasury and the Board of Trade,(e) That there should probably also be arrangements for   ,a common statistical service.Notes: (i)    The above proposals contemplate the abolitionof the Balance of Payments Working Party4      In presentcircumstances it is impossible to separate internal fromexternal policy and only one committee at the permanent secretary level seems to be required.(ii)    The above organisation makes.no provisionfor commercial policy (e.g. Havana Conference andprojects for Customs Unions).      The inter-djepajrbmentalorganisation for this should be separate.-3-
