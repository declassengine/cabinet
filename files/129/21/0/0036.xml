In. July I assented to the Indian Independence Act under which, on15th August two new Dominions, India and Pakistan, came into being. Thuswas brought to fruition the declared policy of Parliament that. the. peoples ofBritish India should achieve complete autonomy within the British Common-wealth. , I trust that the most cordial relations will rule between India and pakistan and. the.other members of the British Commonwealth.   -U The relationship; which had: so, long subsisted between the Crown and the ruling Princes of: India has inevitably also changed.&apos; I acknowledge. withgratitude the loyalty and devotion of the Indian Rulers to Myself and to My Royalpredecessors and I hope that in association with India or Pakistan their tieswith the Commonwealth will endure.I remember gratefully the services of all those men and women whohave served the Crown in India and all those who have given their best in theservice of the peoples of India; particularly I am mindful of the faithful andgallant services of the men of My Indian Forces in time of war.I am grieved at the grave disorders1 now occurring in India and Pakistan.My sympathy goes out to the Governments and peoples of both Dominions intheir present troubles and particularly to the refugees seeking new homes.It gives Me much pleasure to record that self-government in internal affairs has been, restored to Malta, that gallant island whose signal contributionto the commpn cause in the late war has been a source of pride to us all..Delegates chosen by the legislatures of My possessions in the Caribbeanhave discussed the question of the closer association of those territories.

Despite the responsibilities of My Forces overseas and the many tasks at homearising from the aftermath of war, the progress of demobilisation has brought thetotal number of men and women released from them since June, 1945, to about four and three-quarter millions.
