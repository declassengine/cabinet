(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY. OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (4-7) 2652kTH SEPTEMBER,  1947CABINETUNPRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENTSMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalServiceIn accordance with the decision of the Cabinet attheir meeting on 9th September (CM. (47) 75th Conclusions,Minute 3) the Man-Power Committee have considered the detailed proposals in the report annexed to CP. (47) 248 on possible means of directing to productive work the unoccupied and those engaged in unproductive occupations.2. Football Pools and Clubs.    The Committee agreedthat an order should be mado under Defence Regulation 58Agiving me power to require the managements of undertakings ofany type to register particulars of themselves and their  .employees so that they might be submitted, or if necessarydirected, to more useful work.   Under the power conferred bythis order I should then call for particulars from thomanagements of football pools and other gambling enterpriseswith a view to arranging for the transfer of staff to more useful work whorover this seemed to me to be desirable.It will bo recalled that at their meeting on 9th September the Cabinet were averse to the introduction ofnew legislation controlling employment in clubs and that thoHome Secretary asked that the duty of identifying undesirableclubs should not be placed on the police.   The Man-power committee felt,  however, that it would bo desirable to bringclubs within the scope of the order which it is proposed tomake under Defence Regulation 58a,  though in practice thoremay not be much scope for the diversion of labour from them.i propose that the question whether all clubs should berequired to register under these proposals and if not themethod by which the clubs to be registered should be selectedshould be further studied by my Department in association with officials of other interested Departments.    I will submit,if necessary, detailed proposals to my colleagues.3* Street trading.    The Man-Power Committee agreed torecommend that a Bill should be introduced providing that anyperson who engages in street trading, whether as a pedlar or ahawker or by using a motor vehicle, must have a certificatethat he has registered for employment at an employment exchange and that he is not required for essential work.   they recognised that the effective addition to our labour force which would be obtained might not be great but they took thoview that it was desirable that the Government should appear\   150COPY NO. ^ (/
to be doing everything possible to tap this source of man-power.    They took account of the point made at the meetingof the Cabinet on 9th September that there might be some criticism of the legislation on tho ground that it was not.justifiable to take powers enabling the Ministry of Labour toprevent a man from establishing himself in business as astreet trader so long as others were free, without such restrictions, to open a -shop for similar retail business.They felt, however, that this criticism could be met if itwere made clear that the provision was not aimed at regularstreet traders with fixed stances or itineraries, who form part of the normal machinery of retail distribution, but atthe street vendors, who move from one district to another. . Therecan be no comparison between this type of street trader andthe person who incurs the outlay involved in renting andstocking a shop, and, like the regular street trader, depends on the establishment of goodwill for the success of his business.The necessary Bill should if possible be introduced   1early in the new Session.h* Unqccupied persons.   The Man-Power Committee also agreed to recommend that all unoccupied persons within the ages of control should be called on to register compulsorily.They realised that there might be considerable evasion ofthis requirement and that in some areas it would be difficultto suggest suitable employment for those who registered.Nevertheless, they took the view that it was desirable thatthe Government should not lay themselves open to the chargeof neglecting any potential source of labour, and they feltthat it would be difficult to justify the proposed legislation on street trading unless action were taken to require unoccupiedpersons to register. .3* To sura up, the Cabinet are asked -(1)     to agree that an order should be made under defence regulation 5.8a authorising me to require the managements of undertakings to register particulars of themselves and their employees;    that I should exercise this power at once, to obtain particularsfrom the managements of football pools and othergambling enterprises;    and that the method bywhich the power should be exercised in respect ofclubs should be further studied by officials;(2)      to&quot;authorise the introduction early next Session ofa Bill providing that any person who engages instreet trading must have a certificate that he hasregistered for employment at an employment exchange and that he is not required for essential work;(3)      to agree that I should require all unoccupiedpersons within the ages 1 of control to registercompulsorily.(intld.)
