HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (k7)  2662k-th. September,  1947.CABINETTHE TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS AT GENEVA&apos;Memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn my paper C&apos;.P.(k7)  2k5 I proposed to my colleagues the offers which we might make to the United States for the elimination or reduction of preferences enjoyed &quot;by United Kingdomexport trade in other Commonwealth markets.      It will be recalled that these offers were designed to meet the UnitedStates objection that our concessions with regard to preferenceshad so far been inadequate.      In a subsequent minute to thePrime Minister, dated kth September, which I circulated to mycolleagues,  I explained that I thought it desirable to give theUnited Kingdom Delegation at Geneva slightly greater latitudeand the table attached to that minute represented their finalinstructions.2. At a meeting on 15th September at which the other commonwealth- Delegations were, present, the United states representatives stated that they were willing to negotiate onthe basis of the offers of the other Commonwealth &apos;countries butthat the offers we had made were quite unacceptable.      Theyargued that the percentage of preferences covered by our offerswas quite inadequate when measured against the percentage ofUnited States tariffs in which reductions had been offered to us.They said that if we could do nothing better they would have no alternative but to recommend suspending the negotiations.      if however we would agree to cover a much wider field,  they wouldbe prepared to spread eliminations of preference over a periodof ten years and to wait until 1950 before the gradualelimination started,   and they announced that Mr. Clayton wouldmake another appeal to me &quot;for&quot; a solution.3* Mr. Clayton and the United States Ambassador came to seems accordingly on 19th September.      I pointed out to Mr. Clayton&apos;that statistics on the basis of percentages were bound to suggest-that the U.S.A.  had offered more than we had,  since the U.S.A.ore   attacking on a much, wider trade coverage than that of ourfairly limited export trade with the United States.    - Mr. Claytondid not attempt to press his statistical case:;    but, remarkingthat what separated us was not a question of statistics but oneof principle,  switched to the argument that we were committed to the U.S.A.  under obligations which we assumed at the time ofthe Loan Agreement, to do something substantial by way of   .eliminating preferences in return for more general advantages that would accrue to us from United States participation in a multilateral tariff agreement and the consequent increase inUnited States imports and dollar payments.      He was not asking for the complete elimination of preferences, but he handed me anCOPY NO._U
aide-memoire asking for a commitment now for the gradualelimination in the Dominions of preference over one third of thefield of United States exports affected (see Annex A).k* I said at once that I could not accept this interpretation of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s obligations and I discussed the question fairly fully by reference both to theWashington Proposals,  (which were agreed simultaneously withthe Loan Agreement)  and to the Prime Minister&apos;s statement of6th December,  1945*      I said that in my opinion we were nowbeing colled upon to give up far more than we stood to gain andthat, while I should,  of course,  put Mr.  Glayton&apos;s latestproposal to my colleagues,  I should not feel able to recommendthat we should go any further to meet the U.S.A.  in this matter.5. -After the meeting, Mr.  Clayton and the Ambassador askedfor a meeting with the Foreign Secretary and myself,  and we metagain on 21st September.      Mr.  Clayton emphasised strongly that unless we were prepared to go further the Americans would look upon it as a repudiation of one of the important conditions forthe loan.      He reminded me that the other two conditions(a) convertibility of sterling &apos;(b) &quot;non-discrimination&quot; in import restrictionshad already been waived.      But this third condition,  the -elimination of preferences, was one which it was within our powerto fulfil,  and there was no excuse for repudiating it,especially as it could not on his plan have any adverse effect for many years to come.      He went through the various statements and agreements in an effort to prove that we were committed to alarge scale elimination of preferences without any compensationother than the general advantages that we - especially - shouldderive from the general lowering of tariffs.      When it came towhat he was going to do about it he said &quot;I shall recommendMr. Marshall not to accept your offer, but whether he does or notthe American public will regard, it as a repudiation and I couldnot.put it forward to Congress in any other light&quot;.      He referredonly casually to the effect on the Marshall offer.      the ambassador, however,  stepped in to underline this and said itmight well mean that Great Britain would get left out of any help&apos;given undler the Marshall offer.6. The two major questions before us are:-(i)    Are we in fact going back on our obligations from thetime of the Loan Agreement&apos;,  unless we go much furtherby way of giving up preferences?(ii)    Can we afford to stand firm and take a chance as tothe consequences in regard to the Marshall plan?7.   &apos;.  i..     As regards 6 (i) I attach relevant extracts - fromArticle VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement,  the Washington proposals and the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in the House of Commons(Annex B).8. It may be thought that Article VII does contemplateindependent action for the elimination of preferences,  as a formof discrimination.      But the U.S.A.   can make no such claim.For,  as he explained in the House on 21st.April,  19hU,Mr.  Churchill&quot;had not agreed to Article VII of the Mutual Aid
Agreement &quot;without having previously obtained from thePresident a definite assurance.that wo were no more committed to the abolition of Imperial Preference, than the AmericanGovernment were committed to the abolition of their highprotective tariffs.     The discussions as to how a greatervolume of trade and a more harmonious flow of trade can be created in the immediate post-war years in agreement, leavesus,  in every respect,  so far as action is concerned,perfectly free&quot;.9. Further, when it came to drafting the WashingtonProposals, we took care to avoid ambiguity on this point;and it will be seen from, the -first paragraph of the extractthat what was agreed was that action for the elimination of tariff preferences should, be taken, not as somethingadditional to mutual reduction of tariffs, but in conjunctionwith adequate measures for the substantial reduction oftrade barriers and as part of mutually advantageous arrange-ments.10. In any event, we intended to remove any possibledoubt on this by the clear statement in the last two paragraphs of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement, which was previously agreed with the State Department,  that each country is free to judge in the light of the offers made toit how far it-can afford itself to contribute towards the objectives of the Conference and that there is no questionof any unilateral surrender of preferences.11. Mr. Clayton seems to rely primarily on the third paragraph of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement, which recordsour agreement to contract the existing system of preferencesprovided there is adequate compensation in the form ofimprovement in trading conditions between the commonwealth and the rest of the world.   Mr. Clayton thinks that theimprovement in trading conditions to be expected to result from the new United States tariff and the international trade Organisation is sufficient to compensate us for acontraction of preferences on the scale he now proposes.I.can agree that it would not be enough for us to bargainmodifications of preferences against United States tariff reductions item by item, but this is not what we have done.The concessions we,have offered on our own United Kingdomtariffs and by way of the elimination of preferences we enjoycover as much United States trade as the- United States tariff concessions cover United Kingdom trade.    In addition we have offered reductions in preferences affecting nearly as muchUnited States&apos;trade over again.    I could not agree that weowe more than this for the general advantages we may expect to gain from the multilateral aspect of the negotiations.Whatever may have been the background for the Prime Minister&apos;s   -statement in the shape of hopes for a world of convertibilityand more free trading conditions, such gain would on presentprospects.be,  at best conjectural,  and there is a limit tothe commitments that we can afford in payment for them.    It ismy considered opinion that we have reached this limit in the offers we have already made.    It is plain from the last sentence of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement that it is- we who must bethe judges of how far we can go in the light of the mutuallyadvantageous settlement offered in the actual course of thenegotiations.XV : , :X XXXvX&apos; &quot; Xv X,:.-  X;
12. As regards 6 (ii) I have discussed the question -wit.li theForeign Secretary..     The dangers of a break with the Americansover this issue would&apos;seera to he:(a) that we might wreck the whole I&apos;. T.O.  project andmight thereby also undermine the foreign economic policy of the present United States administration.;and strengthen the hands of the economic isolation-ists in the U.S.A.;(b) that the United States Government might refuse us :;idunder the Marshall proposals;(c) there is also the perhaps more remote possibility thatthey would refuse to release the remaining $hOOmillion of the loan and insist on the rigid enforce-ment of our non-discrimination obligation underArticle 9 of the Loan Agreement;(d). that serious harm would consequently be done toAnglo-American relations.13* From a purely economic point of view we cannot afford to offer the Americans any greater concessions.      At -a time when we are particularly dependent on the Commonwealth for our essential supplies we cannot go further by way of giving uppreferences which our exporters consider indispensable to sustain their exports to the Commonwealth.      Nor does the threeyear deferment make the proposal any more acceptable.      We mustnot again undertake a future obligation which we may find it-impossible to discharge when the time comes.      We cannot to-daytell whether our own and world conditions will be such that weshall in fact be able to embark in three years time on preferenceeliminations on the scale stipulated.1U. On political grounds neither the Foreign Secretary non think we can afford these further concessions.      Too great asacrifice of preferences now in response to United States &apos;pressure would be strongly resented by all shades of opinion inthis country. .    It would be misunderstood throughout theCommonwealth.15.- Denial-of Marshall aid to us would be very serious,but the Americans would hove to face the probability that without our inclusion the proposals produced in Paris wouldcollapse.16. It is possible, that Mr.  Clayton,  exasperated by thefrustration of his undoubtedly sincere hopes, may carry hiscolleagues with him in his view that the United Kingdom isdishonouring its obligations and persuade them to break on this issue.      Such action would hurt the U.S.A.  quite as much as ourselves and would serve only to strengthen the hands of theRussians and the Communist parties in Western Europe.Nevertheless we cannot entirely discount the possibility thatMr.  Clayton may induce his colleagues to do in haste what theymay regret at leisure.      We should,  however,  try to ensure.   through H.M.  Ambassador that Mr. Marshall himself is fully aware- of our views and the implications of a break before hetakes a final decision.&apos;
17. Having regard to all the circumstances I ask mycolleagues -(i)    to&apos; authorise me to refuse any further concessionand accordingly to send the letter at Annex 0to Mr. Clayton;(ii)    to authorise the Foreign Secretary to send thenecessary instructions to H.M. Ambassador in washington.R.S.C.Board of Trade,  S.W.1.21+th September,  1947.
DBLuG^IOi; OF Tlia UNITED STATES 0? AFRICA^-IQKAKDui; FOR SIR ST-^OED 0RI1-ESOn August 21 tho United States tariff negotiating team handed the United Kingdom tariff negotiating toon a list of requests for further reductions in preferences enjoyed iy the United Kingdom, for a limited number of gradual eliminations and a limited number of immediate eliminationsbeyond those previously offorcd by tho United Kingdom.    The responso thatwas made to this request on September 9 was not satisfactory, for reasons give to representatives of the United Kingdom on September 15.    Wo aretherefore making an oltomativo proposal in the folloTdng terms.1.    It is proposed that tho United Kingdom agree to the elimination of preferences which it envoys on a broad range of products, such elii-iinationto be postponed for three years beyond the effective date of the trade agreement and to involve the gradual reduction of the preferential marginsthen obtaining over a period not to exceed ten years. . It is proposed thatthis action should affect not less than one third,.by value, of importsfrom the United States into countries concerned of products subject topreference, such imports to be measured in terns of pre-war tro.&amp;e, and thatit should include action on products of significance in the export trade ofthe United States.    The particular items to be covered by such action shouldbe selected from among those on which requests for the elimination of preferences wore originally made by the United States, with the possibleaddition or substitution of such other items as might be agreed upon.2.     In a number of cases present negotiations between the United Statesand other countries in the British Commonwealth for the reduction of their most-favoured-nation rates would, if the reduction sought is to be obtained,involve additional reductions in tho margin of preference enjoyed by theUnited Kingdom.     It is proposed that the United Kingdom give its consent to such reductions.3.     It is understood that tho offers mado before September 9, for thereduction or elimination of preferences which the United Kingdom enjoys,will be maintained, and that products on which, eliminations of preferencewore offered prior to September 9 would, of course, be counted in tho totalof eliminations referred to in paragraph (1)*It is to bo hoped that the gradual elimination of preferencescon be accomplished through the gradual reduction of the most-favourcd-natior.rate.    In those cases, however, in which the countries granting the preferences concerned arc unwilling to agree to this procedure, it isproposed that gradual elimination bo accomplished by the gradual increaseof tho preferential rate or by gradual adjustments in both rates.\7.L.C.September 20* 19^7*

Proposals for consideration by an International Conference on Trade andEmployment. (December 6th, 1945*) (&quot;Cmd.6709)Section B.   Tariffs and Preferences.1.     Import tariffs and preferences.     In the light of the principles setforth in Article VII of the mutual-aid agreements, members should enter into arrangements for the substantial reduction of tariffs andfor the elimination of tariff preferences,, action for the elimination of tariff preferences being taken in conjunction with adequate measures for the substantial reduction of barriers to world trade, as part of the mutually advantageous arrangementscontemplated in this document.As an initial step in the process of eliminating tariff preferences it should be agreed that:a.     Existing international comrnitments will not be permitted to stand in the way of action agreed upon with respect to/tariff......- The Atlantic Charter.
tariff preferences.b. All negotiated reductions in most-favored-nation tariffs will operate automatically to reduce or eliminate margins ofpreference.c. Margins of preference on any- product will in no case beincreased and no new preferences will &quot;be introduced.k*    Statement by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on December6th, 1945.   &apos;There is&apos; one particular&apos; matter arising out of the terms ofArticle VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement -which is of especial interest and importance to the British Commonwealth and Empire - that is the questionof tariff preferences.     i would therefore refer shortly to that aspect of the American document which deals with both tariffs and tariff preferences.The statementsets forth the procedure to be followed by commonconsent in considering, in the context of a general lowering of tariffs and other trade barriers, what contribution can be made from our side byway of reduction or elimination of preferences.The statement makes it clear that, in pursuit of the objectives ofArticle VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement, we for our part are ready toagree that the existing system of preferences within the BritishCommonwealth and the Empire will be contracted, provided there is adequate compensation in the form of improvement in trading conditions. between Commonwealth and Empire countries and the rest of the world.The statement further provides that in entering negotiations forthe reduction of tariffs the parties concerned will not refuse todiscuss the modification of particular preferences on the ground thatthese are the subject of prior commitmentsj   on the contrary, allmargins of preference will be regarded as open to negotiation, and itwill of course be for the parts? negotiating the modification of anymargin of preference which it is bound by an existing commitment to givea third party, to obtain the consent of the third party concerned.Further points to be noted are:-(i) The statement makes it clear there is no commitment on any country in advance of negotiations to reduce or eliminate anyparticular margin of preference.     The position is that each countryremains free to judge in the light of the offers made by all the others, the extent of the contribution it co.n make towards the realisation of the agreed objectives.(ii) It is recognised that reduction or elimination of preferences can only be considered in relation to and in return for reductions of tariffs and other barriers to world trade in generalwhich would make for mutually advantageous arrangements for the.expansion of trade.     There is thus no question of any unilateralsurrender of preferences.     There must be adequate compensation forall parties affected.The statement does not in advance of the detailed negotiations lay down how far the process of reduction and elimination of preferenceswill be carried at this immediate stage.     It must be realised that somepreferences are of particular importance to the economy of certain partsof the Yjorld just as seme tariffs are important in others.     the elimination of oil preferences&apos; would be such a step as would require amost substantial and vddespread reduction of tariffs and other trade/barriers....3. above.
terriers by a large number of countries.     Thus it is recognised that the degree to which the final objectives can be reached at the initialstage can only appear at the negotiations themselves and as the resultof-a. mutually advantageous settlement.Extract from&apos;Statement by the President of the Board of Trade in the..&apos;.Ho.use ofCommons on March 24-th, 1947&apos; &apos;I was just saying that we shall certainly not give away interestsof other Commonwealth countries in reducing preferences enjoyed-by themin the United Kingdom-markets,,&apos; and we are equally sure that we can count on them to treat us in the same way, and not to give away preferenceswhich we value in their markets.     Whatever is given.up, will have to be part of a mutually satisfactory bargain.     That is the whole basic ideaof the negotiation on the tariff side on which we are going to proceed at Geneva.     That is also the basis of these preparatory conversations which are now going forward amongst the countries of the commonwealth and Empire in London.     We, of course, recognise very well in thisrelation that some industries, including agriculture particularly,perhaps have been developed in Empire countries on the basis of marketsassured by preferential arrangement.     V/e do not want suddenly, tomodify these preferences to an extent that is going to cause realdisruption and distress in the overseas countries concerned.     In thelong term, we can, I think, avoid any such results by the successfulimplementation of the whole of the terms of the proposed trade charter.In the short term, the consultations that are now going on between representatives of the .Commonwealth countries should make all parties,including ourselves, fully aware of the dangers of sudden -action of that kind and should, therefore, enable us to avoid them.
ANNEX  &apos;C.  ;    PROPOSED LETTER. TO MR.   CLAYTONi have reported fully to the Cabinet what you told me and the Foreign Secretary with regard to our preference offers.We have discussed in .the light of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement of December,  1945s your contention that we were under an obligation to relinquish preferences in exchange, not for specific concessions in the United States tariff, but for thegeneral benefits which would accrue,  especially to the UnitedKingdom, from a multilateral trade agreement in which the UnitedStates and many other countries participated.We recognise fully that we ore committed to action byway of the elimination or reduction of preferences,  as well asby the reduction of tariffs,&quot; in return for tariff concessions tous,  and that the account cannot be balanced solely on a bilateralbasis since both sides must take stock of the advantages thatmay be expected from a multilateral arrangement.We consider, however,  that we have already offeredconcessions on the United Kingdom tariff,  and by way ofeliminations and reductions of preferences that we enjoy, whichcover twice as much trade as the concessions offered by you to us.i enclose a note of statistical analyses which shows clearlyhow far we have gone beyond the sort of arithmetical balance&quot;which would have been appropriate to a purely bilateral&apos;agreement.      In our view what we offer is fully adequatecompensation for both the&quot; bilateral and the multilateraladvantages which we can expect to obtain.      In so for moreoveras the concessions offered in the United States tariff ore more&apos;generous.on manufactured goods than on primary products,  I mustremind you that the-latter are the key to any great increase inUnited States imports from the Commonwealth countries,-which in turn are our principal export markets.
An agreement in the terms we have offered would make itsufficiently difficult for us to satisfy Parliament and publicopinion that we have not bargained away more than we stand to gain.     We hope that you will be able to present to your congress and public an account of the positive action you will have secured in respect of preferences which will give them cause forsatisfaction with the results of your negotiations.      In theCabinetfs view the offers we have made to you amply carry out what is required of us under the terms of the Prime Minister&apos; sstatement of 6th December, 1.9.1+5.: which you saw before it was made.&apos;If we were to go still further in the sense requestedin^ your Aide Memoire of 19th September we should be promising nowto take action in three years&apos;  time in circumstances which cannotbe foreseen and without adequate concessions in&apos;&apos;return.      In thopresent uncertain state of the world and in the light of experienceit would be wrong for us to accept an obligation,  to come intoforce&apos; at a date in the future, which we might find when the time came we could only carry out at a cost we could not bear.     what we can undertake,  and indeed -hove already shown ourselves ready  toundertake in the draft Charter (Article 17),   is to negotiate again for further reductions of preferOnces against concessions in return on a mutually advantageous basis at any time.      And in&apos;themeantime there would be no increase of any preferences - an obligation which we accepted in the Proposals and are ready to reaffirm in the Charter without any corresponding concession inreturn..    As far as we ore concerned we can soy, here and now,that we should be ready for further discussions on tariffs andpreferences after as short an interval as throe years and in  thelight of all the circumstances at the time.
Both, our Delegations in Geneva have collaboratedsuccessfully.in carrying forward the Proposals which we jointlyagreed in 1945,  and. we are now at last in sight of the Charter --for which we hove all worked so patiently and so long.      we feel for our part that it -would be a great misfortune if thispoint of difference that -has come up between us were to placein jeopardy all our efforts over the much wider field, and i venture to express the hope, which is shared by all mycolleagues in the Cabinet,  that you&apos; and your colleagues in washington will agree,  in the light of all the circumstances,that the of f ers-we have mode to you provide a sufficientbasis for a mutually advantageous -agreement.
