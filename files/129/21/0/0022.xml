The run-down between 30th September,- 19*1-7 and31st March,  1949, would in practice involve the. release of no less than 800,000 men&apos; and women I that is to say, the releaseo:tltcestimate
It will also be observed;thatfor 30th June,  19Z48 the estimate is 839,000 which,  subject to ah essential three months&apos; timelag, represents a reduction of 2148,000 on the figure of1,087,000.     In addition, it is not now expected that theindustrial man-power engaged on Service production, research and development will exceed 350,000 at the end of this financiayear as compared with the original forecast of 1450,000.Further reductions may be expected for 1^48/14.9 when the time comes to settle the production programmes for that year.3. In considering these possible reductions, theDefence Committee concentrated on the following main points:-(a) The assumptions on which the planning of thestrength of the three Services is being carried out;(b) The nature of the risks involved in accepting,reductions of this order;(c) The - conditions under which the run-down by31st March,  I9I48 can be achieved;-(d)    The possibility of reducing the intake ofNational Service men;(e)    The possibility of achieving a still more rapidrun-down than that visualised in paragraph 2 above.In the remaining paragraphs of this note I summarisefor the consideration of the Cabinet the.conclusions reached by.the Defence Committee on these points.The Planning AssumptionsI4,. The assumptions on which the planning of the strengthof the three Services is being based are set out in Section 1of the memorandum at Annex.      I draw the particular attentionof the Cabinet to paragraph 8 in which I underline theassumption that there will be no major war during the next five years.      This is a far-reaching assumption.      It means that for the next five years and for a considerable further period during which_they are being built up,   the Armed forces will be unfit,  either in quantity or quality,  to wage a major war.     The Defence Committee recognise the serious nature ofthe risk&quot;in making this assumption,  but consider it to be onewhich must.be accepted in the prevailing economic and financial circumstances.The Strategic and Political Risks5. The strategic risks and political consequencesinvolved in the running down&apos;of the strength of the Armed force to the figures given in paragraph 2 above are Set out inparagraph 19.from which it will be seen that the strength ofour Army, Navy end Air Force will be drastically reduced, both at home and overseas.      In particular, we shall be -virtually   .abandoning our position in the Pacific,  seriously weakeningour strength in the Middle East and Germany,  and providing no margin to meet unforeseen contingencies.     Here again theDefence Committee fully recognise the nature of these risks butbelieve that they must be accepted in current circumstances.
The &quot;Reduction of the Intake--of National Service Men6. In paragraphs 18. and. 26 of my memorandum, I point-out that if the run-down in paragraph 2 above is to beachieved,  the number of National, Service men which would normally be taken into the Forces under the National service acts-will have to be reduced as follows: -(a) 17,500 National Service entrants will have tobe withheld during the next six months if the strength ofthe. Armed Forces is to be reduced to 937,000 by31st March, 19*48;(b) 27,000 additional National Service entrantswill have to be withheld in &quot;&quot;1948/24 9 if the NationalService intake in that year is to be limited to 150,000as one of the steps, required if the strength of the armed forces is to be further reduced to the suggested figureof 713,000 by 31st March, 19U9-7* The required restriction of intake presents noinsuperable difficulty as regards the remainder of this financial year.     In one way or another, the necessary &apos;administrative&apos;arrangements can, I understand, be made bythe Ministry of Labour.      The problem of restricting intaketo the extent required in I9I48/I49, without damage to theessential fabric of &apos;the National Service scheme, is muchmore difficult.      That problem is now under jurgent examination by the Man-Power Working Party end, as soon &quot;as possible,  theMinister of Labour and I will present- detailed proposals tothe Defence Committee.      Meanwhile, however, the Committeehave agreed that any man-power planning must proceed on thebasis that the National Service intake will in fact be limited in the manner described in paragraph 6 above.Run-down, to .51st March,  19hS8,. In paragraph 26 of my memorandum I set- out fourconditions which must be fulfilled if the run-down to937,000 is to be achieved by 31st March, 19^8.     The DefenceCommittee are satisfied  that three.of these conditions conbe fulfilled - there will be sufficient shipping availableto bring home the necessary number of men, provided Serviceneeds are given due priority;    the wide disparity betweenreleases in different branches and trades and the greater useof retention of individuals on grounds of military necessitymust be  accepted;    and as explained in paragraph J above,arrangements can be made to withhold 17,500 National Serviceentrants in the next six months.      In anticipation of cabinet approval,  the. Defence Committee have, therefore,  decided thatthe proposed reduction to 937,000 by.&quot;.31st March,  192+8 shouldbe accepted and    instructions, have been issued to service departments accordingly.      The Cabinet should, however, be aware that it is by no means yet certain that it will bepossible to withdraw from overseas all those troops on whichthis reduction to 937,000 depends.     For example,  the estimatedrun-down has been based on the assumptions that we shall be out of Austria/ Italy, Greece and Japan by 31st March, 19U8,that we shall be able to make substantial reductions in theMiddle East- and that British Forces will be out- of India by31st December,  1947. &apos;    In actual fact,  some of these assumptionsmay not be realised -
(a) It is unlikely that an Austrian Treaty willbe. ratified by 31st March, .19i(8 and we cannot completelywithdraw our troops from there- until three months afterratification;(b) We are committed by Treaty to keep c. forceof approximately 5*000 for 90 drys after the Governor assumesoffice in Trieste.     Thereafter .the Governor will&apos; have theright tc say whether he still requires the presence ofAllied troops up to the agreed number, or less.     No governor has yet been appointed;(c) We have still to obtain Australian and Americanconcurrence to the withdrawal of the British element ofthe British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan;(d) It has recently been necessary io make a small increase in the size of the- garrison in the Sudan.     This,in a small way, may affect our ability to come down to the planned ceiling by 31st March,  194 8.(e) In view of the disturbed situation, we have hadto make plans for the protection of British nationals inEgyot in an emergency.      If the three Brigades at presentallotted for this purpose have to be maintained afterMarch, 19h8,  this action will affect our ability to reach the planned ceiling for 31st March, 1943;(f) The strength of the Army in Palestine will, by march, 1948,  have- been reduced to a figure which will onlybe acceptable if conditions are no worse then than they arenow.     Any deterioration of the situation might have an effect on our ability to reach the present planned ceilingby 31st March.(g) &apos;There will be- some delay beyond the end of 1947in completing the withdrawal of British troops from India,as some allowance has had to be made for the evacuation ofother categories of British personnel, in the limited shipping available.      - *Notwithetendinp these uncertainties,  the DefenceCommittee agreed that we must continue to plan for the fullrun-down to 937,000 by 31st March,  1948.      If there should prove to be a. serious discrepancy between these planningassumptions and the actual course of events, the situation would have to be re-examined.Possibility of Further Reductions9* . At the request of the Defence Committee, I haveconducted a searching and detailed examination into thepossibility of further accelerating the run-down inparagraph 2 above, but have corne to the conclusion that I amunable to recommend any improvement on these f figure,s. .    TheDefence Committee have considered this conclusion and agree-with it for1 the following reasons:-(a)    The Admiralty is to reach its estimated strengthof lL/7,000 in six instead of eighteen months.      This initself involves major measures of reorganisation and re-deployment - as well as the serious consequences described in paragraph 19 of D.0.(m7) 68.      Further reduction is impracticable, either in the current financial year, or in1948/49.
(b) The War- Office is being celled upon to reduce,the size of the *..r.my by 211,000 within the next six months,and a further 188,000 by 31st March,  1949 - with two-thirds of the I9I48/49 reduction in the first six months of that year.As explained in paragraph 8 above, these reductions are based on a. variety of assumptions regarding the liquidation of overseas commitments.      They will also involve majormeasures of reorganisation, particularly in Germany and inthe training organisation for National Service entrants.*/.S matters now stand it would be unrealistic to plan forlower figures.(c) The Air Ministry is estimating that the strengthof the Air Force will fail from its present figure of307,000 to 263,000 within the next six months, and to227,000 by the end of March, 19*49-      Acceleration of this process-would have the most serious effect, both short-term and long-term,  on the. operational efficiency of the Air force to which. the highest importance is attached.Conclusions10. To sum up, with the approval of the DefenceCommittee, I recommend that- the &quot;Cabinet -(i)   Accept the serious risks and political consequences involved ill reducing the .......strength.of our Armed . Forces,  as described in paragraph 19 of the memorandum at Annex;(ii)   Approve the proposal that the National Serviceintake into the three Services shall bereduced to approximately 150,000 in 1914.8/1+9(100,000 Army, 148,000 Air Force and 2,000 Navy)and take note that ways and means of achieving this reduction are now being urgently considered;(iii)    Approve the following estimate for the strengthof the forces at 31st March, 191+9;Navy 1147,000Army 339,000Air Force- 227,000Total: 710.000(iv)    Endorse the decision of the Defence Committeeto reduce the strength of the forces to theestimated figure of &quot;937, 000 . at 31st March,  194-8;take note that this reduction is based on anumber of assumptions,  all of which may notbe realised,  in respect of the liquidation ofsome of our overseas military commitments;    and agree that this is the limit of reduction forthe current financial year;(v)    Take note that if the above- decisions are taken,. the estimated&apos; run-down of the forces as nowrevised would be -

The.Defence Committee agreed-that, if these-;proposals were approved by the Cabinet, the proper coursewould;be to contemplate a Government statement in the courseof the Debate on the Address.

ANNEX[D.O. (47) 68Sipntpm^ov 19471CABINETDefence CommitteeDEFENCE REQUIREMENTSMemorandum by the Minister of defence i. IntroductoryDURING recent months I have been engaged, in consultation with the Chiefsof Staff, upon an examination of our future defence policy and of the size and composition of our peacetime Armed Forces.     , .______ 2. Simultaneously I have been considering the possibilities of making short-term reductions in the size of the forces in order to reduce their requirements offoreign currency and to release as many men as possible for work m productiveindustry. Early in August I recommended to the Defence Committee that inorder to assist us in our financial and economic difficulties the strength of theforces at 31st March, 1948, which under previous plans would have been1,087,000, should be reduced by a further 80,000 to 1,007,000 and that as many as 210,000 men should be withdrawn from overseas stations by the same date.3. This proposal was approved by the Cabinet on 5th August (CM. (47)68th Conclusions, Minute 2). 1 continued to seek further rapid reductions in numbers, but I was soon forced to the conclusion that we had gone as far as we ought to go in the way of making piecemeal and arbitrary reductions in theabsence of any clear idea of longer-term policy or of the size and composition of the. forces which -would be required to carry it out in 1948-49 and subsequent years. &apos; *4. I have therefore during the past few weeks spent much time in consul-tation with the Service Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff on longer-term issues,particularly as they affect the requirements of man-power and money for thefinancial year 1948-49 I have now reached the stage where I feel that I mustacquaint my colleagues with the general picture, in order that they may judge the current situation against its correct background.5. On 18th February I issued a directive to the Chiefs of Staff asking themto consider the fundamental principles of our post-war defence policy and togive me their views on the form and nature of our forces over a long-term period.To impart reality to their deliberations I gave it as my view that expenditureon the forces in peacetime would be severely limited and that it could not beexpected that the defence share of the national budget, after clearing up theaftermath of war, would be likely to exceed  600 minion a year.6. On 30th May I issued a further directive to the Chiefs of Staff, ampli-fying my earlier views, re-emphasising the financial limitations within which theirplanning would have to take place, and laying down a precise timetable for the submission of reports on-(a) the size and composition of our forces in a normal peacetime year;(&amp;) the size and composition of cur forces in the financial year 1948-49;both costed in money and man-power.34231b
7. This information was provided in individual reports from the service departments early in August, and it was at once clear to me that the money andman-power which would be required if these proposals were adopted would be far beyond the capacity of the country in this time of economic stress. I do not propose to go into detail at this stage, but it will be sufficient if I say that theDefence Estimates for 1948-49 would have amounted to more than  900 million.,8. It was obvious, therefore, that some drastic change of the policy whichhitherto the Chiefs of Staff have followed would be necessary. After consultationwith them I issued a further directive on 23rd August calling for an urgentre-examination on the following basis : &quot; General Assumptions(i) It is not possible to contemplate undertaking a major war until our economic and industrial strength has recovered. It must thereforebe accepted that an annual expenditure of  600 million will bethe maximum allowed to the Armed Forces, including expenditureon production and defence research, for an indefinite period;(ii) It must be accepted that the risk of a major war is ruled out duringthe next five years, and that the risk will increase only graduallyduring the following five years. This risk will vary directly withour visible offensive strength. If attacked we must fight with what we have;. . (iii) It must he accepted that the financial limit imposed may prevent us having the defence forces hitherto considered necessary on theoutbreak of war. It will therefore be necessary to build up only&apos;the forces which give us the best chance of survival, and to&apos; avoid&apos;dissipating our resources.   This will mean taking serious risks.Principles which govern the Composition of our Forces(iv) Priority must be given to forces which in peace give the best visibleshow of strength and therefore.have the greatest deterrent value; .i (v) Long-term research and development should have high priority inidefence expenditure;(vi) We must provide the minimum forces necessary for our essentialoverseas garrisons and stations;(vii) No additional provision should be made for forces which might be1required by the United Nations.&quot;9. It will be observed that under the terms of this directive our policy forthe next five years would bear no relation to any state of preparedness for war,but would be concentrated on maintaining the forces in being at the minimumlevel, while at- the same time endeavouring to provide for essentials and to main-tain the best possible show of deterrent strength.10. Such a policy as that outlined in the previous paragraph necessitatessettling an order of priority between the various competing requirements for the limited resources of man-power and money which we shall be able to afford for defence purposes during the next few critical years. So far I have received no collective appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff on what these priorities shouldbe. I have, however, given a good deal of thought to the problem and, in myopinion, the broad basis of priority, as between the respective Services, is asfollows: (a) Defence research and development for all three Services.    This is all-important.(b) Maintenance of the Royal Air Force at a level sufficient to preserve its essential structure and to maintain the best possible show of deterrentstrength.(c) Maintenance of the Navy at the minimum level required to safeguard our;sea communications, to carry out such commitments overseas as arelaid upon it, and to preserve a nucleus on which we could expand if itshould become necessary to do so. This policy.will necessitate a scalingdown of Naval plans, more especially as regards large capital ships;it implies concentration on the Naval Air Arm and retention of cruisers and below in adequate numbers.
Id) Employment of the Army as a training organisation for the National&apos; . 5 Service intake, upon which its long-term defence policy must rest,v- and to provide the minimum strength needed to meet its overseas commitments.   These commitments will undoubtedly have  to be*     n        substantially reduced.11. More work is still required on our long-term policy and on its application in the years after 1948-^9. I can, however, see no escape from an approach to theproblems of 1948-49 against the general background which, I have sketchedabove-and it is only after an examination on that basis of defence requirementsduring the next financial year that one can form a correct judgment on theimmediate situation.II. 1948-49 Defence Requirements12. I have already mentioned that the figures for 1948-49 which were originally prepared by the Service Departments, plus the requirements of theMinistry of Supply for defence research and development, inspection, and warterminals, amounted to more than  900 million..13. After intensive examination on the basis of my latest directive, this figure was reduced to approximately  825 million, divided between the three services and the Ministry of Supply as follows :   million   millionNavy ...      ...      ... 185* (including 3^ terminals)Army ... ... 366 ,, 36        ,,Air Force    ..:      ... 206 12Ministry of Supply ... 70 (including 20   terminals, approximately)Total    ...      ... 827 ,, 71 * Including  7 - 75 million for research and development.14. At this point, I must make it clear that 1948-49 can in no sense beregarded as a normal peace-time year, so far as expenditure on the Services isconcerned. Even if  600 million is feasible as a target from 1949 onwards, itcannot be reached next year. Examination of the table above will show that expenditure on war terminal charges, including payment of release benefits, com-pensation for requisitioned property, and contract termination charges, will stillamount to about  70 million. This is an inescapable liability. In addition,many of the commitments imposed upon us as a result of the war and thedisturbed situation which it created will still remain. We shall still be inoccupation of the British Zones of Germany; we shall, unless the United Nationscome to an unexpectedly early and favourable decision on Palestine, still have aconsiderable force locked up in that country; our commitments in the rest ofthe Middle East theatre, and notably in Egypt, will still be large, as the tasks of middle East Command remain heavy and, in particular, there is a great mass ofvaluable stores in Egypt which cannot be abandoned without serious effects onour war reserves and which will take a long time to transfer to other depots;the task of clearing up the &quot; aftermath of war&quot; in this country., including suchduties as Clearance of dangerous areas, disposal of surplus ammunition, controland administration of prisoners of war, and the like, will still be onerous; andthe training organisations of all three Services must still be large owing to thecontinued rapid outflow of the most highly trained men under the age and servicegroup release scheme, and the necessity.to train men to replace them.15. I am, nevertheless, certain that a total of  825 million for the defence budget in. the financial year 1948-49 is far higher than anything that the Gdvern-ment or Parliament would be prepared to contemplate. After the most searchingenquiry, I have ascertained that considerable further economies can still be madeprovided His Majesty&apos;s Government accept the strategical risks and political con-sequences involved, though I must emphasise that many of them will be contraryto the present views of the Service Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff. This is, of34231 b 2
course, not the time to settle the money provision for defence in the next financialyear, and at this stage I will go no further than to suggest in the most tentativeway that it should, subject to further close examination, be possible to arrive ata total for the 1948-49 defence estimates of something in the neighbourhood of 710 million, including terminals, divided between the three Service departments and the Ministry of Supply very roughly as follows : .   MillionNavy      ...      ...      ......      ...      ...      155*Army      ...      ...      ............      316Air Force..................      180Ministry of Supply............        60Total ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      711* Including research and development.16. To arrive at such figures as these, large reductions in the strength of theforces both during the remainder of the current financial year and over the wholeof 1948-49 will be necessary. I shall deal later in this memorandum with thepossibility of making further reductions between now and 31st March, 1948. Mytentative proposals for man-power strengths during 1948-49 would involve a run-down to the following figures at Slst March, 1949 (a reduction of nearly300,000 on the present approved figure of 1,007,000 for 31st March, 1948, andof nearly 500,000 on the figure as it will be on 30th September, 1947) :-Navy....................      147,000Army...................      339,000Air Force..................      227,000Total    ...      ...      .......      ...      713,000The reduction of 500,000 between 30th September, 1947, and Slst March,1949, does not, of course, represent the total releases planned from the Forcesbetween those dates, which may well amount to about 800,000.I must add, however, that if these financial and man-power savings are tobe feasible it will bejiecessary to reach by 31st March, 1948, the figures whichI propose in Part 111 of this memorandum.17. The effect on the Services of such considerable reductions in man-powerand money as those which I have in mind will inevitably be very serious. before i deal with the consequences which flow directly from reductions in man-power should make it clear that our future planning of Forces&apos; man-power mustretain in its essentials the future scheme of national service embodied in theAct passed this summer. The military necessity for the scheme as the only means of building up reserves for an emergency remains unchanged. Apart fromthis the political consequences of abandoning it, after the very strong speechesby Government spokesmen made in the course of the debates on the NationalService Bill, would be such as I do not think the Government can contemplate.But I do think there will have to be some limitation of the numbers of national servicemen taken into the three Services, both in 1948-1949, and possibly in later years. The target figures I have just given for the strength of the Forces at31st March, 1949, will not admit of more than the following intake of national servicemen in the coming financial year : Navy............ 2,000 (practically a token figure)Army.......&apos;..      ...      100,000Air Force   .........        48,00018. This total of 150,000 will fall some 27,000 short of the numbers whichthe Ministry of Labour anticipate will be the net product of the age groupsdue for call-up in 1948-49. I think it will be necessary to ask the Ministerof Labour to extend the deferment of call-up under the National Service Actsto the widest range&apos;of essential industries. I understand that to produce the desired result the whole field of deferment for industry will have to be reviewed by the Ministry of Labour, including the continuance of deferment of the building
342315 ,trades, which I believe at present accounts for appreciable numbers. It seems likely that, among others, the following industries, in addition to coalmining and agriculture, would probably have to be included in the range of deferment:electrical plant, mining and gas equipment, locomotives and wagons, iron andsteel, foundries, textile machinery, pottery, china clay and ball clay. I realise that the reasons for extending deferment to certain of these trades are stronger than in others. In a later section (paragraph 26) I state that this extension of deferment should take place at once, if we are to effect a further reduction inthe present target figure of 1,007,000 in the Forces at 31st March, 1948, whichI propose later in this Paper.19. An indication of the consequences which flow primarily from the reduc-tions in man-power foreshadowed for 1948-49, for each Service, is as follows  Navy(a) A large scrapping programme of ships at present in reserve will haveto be carried out.  This is likely to be of the following order :  5 battleships.11 cruisers.55-60 destroyers and frigates.1 aircraft component repair ship.Some submarines.Considerable numbers of combined operations craft, fleet train,and small craft.(b) A drastic, but it is hoped in some cases temporary, reduction of strength on foreign stations, including the following measures : Reduction of the American and West Indies Squadron to : 1 cruiser, and1 frigate.Reduction of the British Pacific Fleet to: 2 cruisers, and4 frigates.Reduction of the Naval Dockyard at Hong Kong to care andmaintenance.(e) The abandonment of the Admiralty&apos;s wreck dispersal organisation, withprobable serious effects on commercial shipping. ,id) Reduction of the Royal Marines by the equivalent of two Commandos.\eS Reduction of the Combined Operations organisation.(/) Reduction of the Home Fleet to a strength of :* 1 battleship,1 fleet carrier,3 cruisers, and destroyers,(plus a training squadron)and virtual immobilisation even of this reduced strength for a periodof about eight months between October 1947 and May 1948 in orderthat men due for release in these ships may be removed withoutrelief.Army(a) Fighting formations are being reduced to : One infantry division.One infantry brigade.One parachute brigade.And training formations to :-One infantry division-One armoured brigade.One infantry brigade.One parachute brigade.(b) There will be no regular armoured division.(c) In consequence there will be a heavy cut in all Arms, e.g., regularinfantry battalions will be reduced from 113 to a maximum of 72, ofWhich only 24 will be operational, as compared with 138 before thelate war.
(d) The world-wide distribution of the Army will be as follows :- United Kingdom A.A. Command.Coast Artillery.Household Troops.Regular permanent staff and units for T.A.Training Organisation.Base administrative organisationGermany One Infantry Training Division.One Armoured Training Brigade.One Infantry Training Brigade.One Parachute Brigade (Operational)One Parachute Training Brigade.Middle East, including Palestine One Infantry Division (Operational).One Infantry Brigade (Operational).AA. Defence for bases.Malaya and Hong Kong One British/Gurkha Division (forming).Other Minor Garrisons Gibraltar: one battalion.Malta: two battalions.Cyprus: one battalion.Sudan: one battalion.Cyrenaica: three battalions.&quot;West Indies : one battalion.(e) No provision has been made for the Control Commission in Germany, thePolish Resettlement Corps, or British backing for the Indian,Pakistani or Burrnan Armies. In addition it has been assumed thatthe situation in Palestine will be such as to allow us to reduce theforces there to one division. If these commitments remain, additionalman-power will be required.(/) Our ability to garrison the Far East will be entirely dependent on thesuccess of Gurkha recruiting, which is an unknown factor.(g) The broad effect of dispositions of this kind can be seen from the followingbreakdown of the estimated strength of the Army at 31st March,1949United Kingdom   .......Germany     ...      ...Middle East (including Palestine)Far East (excluding Gurkhas)Other overseas garrisons ...British element of colonial forces ...Miscellaneous .......339,000Air Force(a) Reduction of the front line strength of the Royal Air Force to a figureof approximately 1,180 aircraft, as compared with the figure of 1,484forecast in D.O.

This reduction carries with it the followingconsequences : (i) A 20 per cent, reduction in Bomber Command to a strength of160 aircraft.(ii) A 30 per cent, reduction in Fighter Command to a strength of192 aircraft.(iii) The complete elimination of maritime strike squadrons both athome and overseas.188,50070,00051,50012,00010,0004,0003,000
(iv) A reduction of over 20 per cent, in the air transport forces to a figure of 184 aircraft,(v) A reduction of 66 per cent, in the light bomber force in Germanyto a strength of 32 aircraft.20. The strategic consequences of measures of this kind are extremely grave,and must bring with them undesirable political consequences, particularly in the virtual abandonment of our position in the Pacific and the serious weakening ofour strength in the Middle East and in Germany. None the less, the DefenceCommittee must appreciate that if in our present economic situation there mustbe reductions in the forces of the kind outlined above, then there is no escape from the unpleasant decisions required.21. To bridge the gap between the  825 million mentioned&quot; in paragraph 13above and the tentative figure of  710 million mentioned in paragraph 15,considerable further reductions will be necessary. These must perforce be madeon services which are capable of reduction without affecting man-power totals,and particularly on the production and works votes. At the present moment Ishould not like to be committed to any firm views, but I think that I must give some indication to my colleagues of the measures which must be contemplatedif the estimates are to be reduced to the figure which I have in mind. Thefollowing paragraphs will, I hope, serve to give some broad indication.(a) Virtually all work on new construction will be suspended, with theexception of one aircraft carrier and certain prototype vessels whichare urgently needed for research and development.(&amp;) All alterations and additions in ships and fleet establishments intendedto improve amenities will have to be postponed.(c) The dockyard labour force in the United Kingdom will have to be very considerably reduced. This will almost certainly involve putting oneof the southern dockyards, probably -Chatham, on. a care andmaintenance basis.(d) The re-equipment of the Royal Dockyards with modern machinery and plant will be still further delayed.(e) General reductions in the store, armament, and inspection organisationswill be necessary.(/) A further cut in the Admiralty&apos;s oil fuel programme, including stoppingbuilding new fleet oilers, will have to be made.(g) The naval aircraft programme will be severely cut and all modernisation of aircraft carriers will be deferred.  Five air stations will be closed.(h) No new major works projects will be started in 1948-49 and the pro-vision for new minor works will be limited to about  100,000.(i) Certain items in the present approved works programmes will be can-celled, and the housing programme for naval personnel at home andabroad and the modernisation of naval barracks will be further slowed down.(a) New production will be cut to the bare minimum necessary to keep(6) Reduction in maintenance of equfpment will have particularly serious effects on the Army&apos;s vehicles and may result in the partial immobili-sation of the Army by 1950.(c) The Army building programme will be heavily cut.id) Consumption of petroleum products will be still more drasticallyrationed.(e) The organisation of the Territorial Army and Cadet Forces will be muchdelayed.(/) A drastic reduction in the number of civilians employed by the Army willthrow a still greater strain on the reduced military man-power in allstaffs and services where civilians are employed.NavyArmy
&apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; Air Force(a) The re-equipment of . the: Royal Air Force will be drastically curtailed,and there will be a general reduction in the production programme toan extent which must limit the flying Which squadrons can carry out,with most, serious results to training and flying safety.(&amp;); The modernisation or re-surfacing at certain airfields at Home^ and overseas will be deferred, with consequential increased risk of flyingaccidents.: , (c) The provision of married quarters and barracks, on which a belated starthas been made, will remain highly inadequate; maintenance standardswill be further depressed. The effects on morale and recruiting willbe serious.22. The drastic effect of cuts of this kind on the Services will be readilyappreciated. Some of them, notably the reductions in the production and worksprogrammes, cannot be regarded as more than temporary suspension of. expen-diture which will be necessary in the near future if the reduced forces with whichwe&apos; shall be left are to be efficient and contented. The effect oh the country&apos;industrial War potential of reductions in the Service production programme ofthe order which I have in mind has yet to be assessed, and it may well be that itwill be impossible to go as far as I have suggested.. This point is being inve&amp;ti-gated by my Department in consultation with the Ministry of Supply and theAdmiralty. The reduction in the works programmes means that all improvements in conditions of life in the Services will be virtually abandoned for the timebeing. Even though, in my view, this can be defended as part of an essentialreduction in the national investment programme, it will inevitably have its effect upon Service morale and upon recruiting, and it must be remembered that thecontinued recruitment of regulars in all three Services is essential to the futureman-power needs of the Forces. The political and industrial effect of so drastica step as the closing of one of the southern dockyards will need trie most careful examination, which the First Lord of the Admiralty and I are putting in hand at once.23. All these matters will require further consideration by the DefenceCommittee and the Cabinet when the time comes to settle the total of the defence estimates for 1948-49. At the moment I do not seek authority for any of them,and my sole purpose in referring to them in this paper is to warn my colleagues of the extreme measures to which it appears likely that we shall be forced ifthe defence budget is to be reduced to a figure which can be regarded as reasonable in the present critical situation of this country.24. What I do ask the Defence Committee to consider here and now inrelation to 1948-49 is whether, given our current and prospective economic difficulties, we must be prepared to accept the very serious consequences of the substantial run-down in numbers by 31st March, 1949, as described in para-graph 19 above. The Committee should of course remember that this run-downis based on the assumption that the existing Army commitments in Austria; Italy,Trieste, Greece and Japan will have been liquidated by 31st March, 1948, andthat no provision will be required to meet any of the commitments referred toin sub-paragraph (e) of the Army section of paragraph 19. If the Committeeare prepared to face the risks outlined above I ask them to approve, as a basisof planning, the figures contained in paragraph 16.III.-Current Strength of the Armed Forces25. Against the background sketched in Parts Land tl of this Memo-randum, I turn to the question of the strength of the Armed Forces betweenhow and 31st March, 1948. The present approved estimate for that date is1,007,000 which must be compared with my provisional forecast of strengths of approximately 713,000 at 31st March, 1949 (see paragraph 16 above). Theimmediate question for decision is whether it is feasible to contemplate a lower figure than 1,007,000 by 31st March next.26. To increase the pace of the run-down in the Armed Forces will reduce their efficiency arid their ability to undertake their current eomiriitments. as my colleagues are aware I have emphasised on more than one occasion the serious position in which the Services find themselves from the loss of trained men;to increase that loss will present them with further formidable difficulties. None
the less if it is the view of the Defence Committee that, in the light of thecurrent financial and economic situation, still further contributions must be madeby the Services in the release of man-power, I consider, after consultation with my Service colleagues, that, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions, a further reduction can be made. The most essential conditions are    &apos;(a) That the withdrawals from Austria, Italy, Trieste, Greece and Japanare completed by 31st March, 1948. 1(b) That, in view of the embarrassments resulting from the loss pf trained men, a substantial part of this additional contribution must be found by means of an extension of deferments of call-up under the NationalService Acts. I understand that if the area of essential industrieswas stretched to its absolute limit on the basis outlined in para-graph 18 above, it would be possible to grant deferments between now and, 31st March, 1948, to approximately 17,500 men.(c) That shipping is made available for the overseas component of the actualreleases from the Forces. Without a breach in the fundamentalprinciple of the release scheme that releases of men abroad will proceed, group by group, in step with those of men at home, anyspeeding up in the release programme must be contingent upon our ability to bring home those abroad who thus become due for release.The resulting effect upon our shipping situation will no doubt beelaborated to the Defence Committee by the Minister of Transport.I understand, however, that it cannot be other than serious. I am informed that even a reduction of strengths from the present estimateof 1,007,000 by 50,000 (including the extra deferment of 17,500 youngmen) would involve the suspension of the planned reconversion pro-gramme for a period of at least six months from 1st October. Toreduce strengths by, say, 100,000 instead of 50,000 would, I believe,involve the abandonment of the reconversion of three of the five shipsscheduled for release in September with resulting unemployment inthe shipyards in addition to the diversion of ships from their destinedcivil Mercantile Marine purposes with consequential ill effects upon our overseas trade.(d) That much greater use must be made of deferment oh grounds of military necessity, and that wide disparity between releases in differentbranches and trades must be accepted.27. If, and only if, it is possible to fulfil these conditions I consider thatthe strengths of the Forces at 3lst March, 1948, could be reduced by a further70,000 to 937,000. The detailed breakdown of the latter figure as compared withthat announced by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons at the beginningof August would be : Present ProposedNavy        ............        178,000 147,000Army..........      ...        550,000 527,000Air Force............        279,000 263,0001,007,000  . 937,00028. I do not see how larger reductions, between now and the end of this financial year, can be regarded as feasible. Apart from their effect upon theefficiency of the Services they could not be brought into effect unless : (a) Substantial and arbitrary in-roads were made into the National Servicecall-up over and above the limited extension of deferment proposed above. Any such action, in my view, would undermine the whole structure of National Service, which remains one of the foundations of long-term defence policy.(6) The Government jettison the principle that men serving overseas shouldbe released at the same time as men in the same age and servicegroups who happen to be serving at home. In the opinion of theChiefs of Staff and the Service Ministers, with whom I entirely agree,such action would be quite indefensible and would cause the mostserious discontent and unrest in the Services.
29.   I ask the Defence Committee : (i) to take note of the position at present reached on the long-term requirements of Defence within strictly limited resources of money andman-power;(ii) to take note of the provisional forecast of the financial requirements ofthe Defence Estimates for 1948-49;(iii) to decide whether- the serious risks and the political consequencesinvolved in the large-scale reductions in the strengths of our Forcesforecast for 1948-49 must be accepted;(iv) to approve the proposal that the National Service intake in 1948-49shall be reduced to approximately 150,000 (Army 100,000, Air Force48,000, Navy 2,000) by extending deferments beyond agriculture andthe mining industry to include about 25,000 young men in certain other essential industries;(v) subject to the decisions on (iii) and (iv), to approve the following estimate for the strength of the Forces at 31st March, 1949 :  (vi) to agree, subject to the conditions in paragraph 26, that there shouldbe a further reduction of 70,000 in the strength of the Forces to937,000 at 31st March, 1948, and that this is the limit of reductionfor the current financial year involving, as it would, a drop of 150,000from the original approved planning figure of 1,087,000;(vii) to take note that, if the above decisions are taken, the planned run-down of the Forces, as now revised, would be :-Navy ,..Army ...Air Force147,000339,000227,000713,00030.9.4731.3.4830.6.48147,000448,000250,00031.3.49NavyArmyAir Force...182,000738,000*307,000147,000527,000263,000147,000339,000227,0001,227,000937,000845,000713,000(Initialled)A.
