THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1947SECRETCopy No.31CP, (47) 277Srd October, 1947CABINETTHE ANGLO-IRAQI TREATY OF ALLIANCE OF 1930Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsTHE Regent of Iraq, who is at present visiting this country, has in con-versation with me raised the question of revising the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of alliance, the principal provisions of which are summarised in the annex to thismemorandum. The Treaty provides that it shall remain in force until 1957, butthat at the request of either party a new treaty will be concluded at any time after 1952, which shall provide for the continued maintenance and protection in all circumstances of our essential communications. From the informal talkswhich have been held with the Regent and the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs,and from the reports of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Bagdad, it is known that the iraqi Government, under the growing pressure of nationalist feeling in Iraqthat the provisions of the Treaty constitute an infringement of Iraq&apos;s indepen-dence, wish to modify certain of the facilities which we enjoy under -the Treaty.In particular, the Iraqis want some modification of the Treaty provisions underwhich the Royal Air Force have exclusive control over two air bases in Iraq.2. I have given very careful thought to the attitude which we should taketowards the Iraqi Governments approach. It is my considered view that weshould not reject this request for a revision of the Treaty provided that there isa reasonable prospect of finding a basis of agreement for a new long-term treaty which would meet our essential military requirements.3. The Iraqi Prime Minister has himself expressed the view that the defenceof Iraq should be co-ordinated with defence arrangements for the Middle Eastas a whole, and that, this wider question is one for discussion between GreatBritain and all the Arab States. This conception is very much in line with ourown ideas, but unfortunately the development of our general plans for the defenceof the Middle East has been held up by our difficulties with Egypt and the problemof Palestine. It is indeed unlikely, in view of the state of affairs in Egypt and palestine, that common defence talks with all the Arab countries can be enteredinto in the near future with any prospect of success, and this has been made clear to the Iraqis. If, therefore, the present Anglo-Iraqi Treaty is to be revised it will have to be done on a bilateral basis, although without prejudice to future arrangements on a wider regional basis.4. The most important of our Treaty rights under the present Treaty arethe facilities we enjoy at the air bases already referred to above, the maintenanceof essential British communications and the right on request to move british forces in transit across Iraq. Under a revised Treaty it will be necessary toagree to give up exclusive control of the two air bases in order to meet Iraqisusceptibilities. It is, however, essential to our strategic position in the middle east that we should continue to enjoy those facilities on some other suitablebasis. There is, I fear, no prospect of the Iraqi Government agreeing to grantus a lease of the two airfields, but the Regent of Iraq in oral discussion has expressed his readiness to examine the possibility of Treaty revision on thebasis of an arrangement for the sharing of the two airfields. The Chiefs-of-Staff whom I have consulted have agreed in principle to early revision of the Treaty14346   34309
on this basis...:.They have stated that they would prefer to wait until the position,:regaj^djnjg^^BKI and Palestine has been clarified, but add that they realise that the timmgcf negotiations will be governed by political considerations.5. In my opinion political factors make it desirable to examine the possi-bility of Treaty revision now. In this, I am moved by three principal considera-tions. First, we cannot hope to maintain the present position in Iraq for much longer in the face of the growing pressure of nationalist opinion in Iraq fora revision of the Treaty. Secondly, it would be wiser to avoid fighting a diplo-matic rearguard action to defend a position which we are bound to give upin the end, and so arouse the maximum of nationalist fervour and anti-british feeling in the process. Thirdly, there would appear to be a better prospect of reaching a more favourable compromise with the Iraqis now than if we waiteduntil the general situation improved or if we stood on the letter of the treaty and refused to consider revision before 1952. I agree that in the exact timing of the negotiations we must carefully watch the repercussions of the palestine and Egyptian questions, but we cannot afford to wait until they are entirelyout of the way.6. If, therefore, my colleagues agree, I should propose that further informaland secret talks should now be held with the Regent and the Iraqi Government.It is my intention that these talks should be handled cautiously and that weshould give way to the Iraqis no more than is necessary. We could, for instance,begin by offering the Iraqis a share of the facilities at the British bases, whichwould remain under our control, and we would hope thus to end up with a situation in which sharing was nominally on an equal basis, but in which wewould have complete liberty of action in practice. Provided a basis for areasonable agreement is found to exist, I should hope to arrange for formalTreaty&quot; negotiations to take place during the coming months. In this way Ishould hope to avoid protracted negotiations as in the case of Egypt.7. It is essential that no publicity should be given to the fact that Treatyrevision is being informally discussed between His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe Iraqi Government as this might prejudice the prospect of finally concludinga satisfactory revised Treaty.  To this the Regent has assented.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,3rd October, 1947.
-  annex summary of the Principal Provisions of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of alliance of 1930(This Summary includes items contained in unpublished notes attached to theTreaty)Under this Treaty, an alliance is concluded between the two countries asbetween equals.2. The following are the principal obligations whidh His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment assumed: (a) Subject to the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations, ifIraq became engaged in war, to come immediately to her aid in the capacity of an ally.(&amp;) To give &quot; all possible facilities &quot; (the cost to be met by the Iraqis) forthe &apos;&apos; naval, military and aeronautical instruction &apos;&apos; in the UnitedKingdom of Iraqi officers; for &apos;&apos; the provision of arms, ammunition,equipment, ships, and aeroplanes of the latest available pattern &apos;&apos; forthe Iraqi Forces; and for &apos;&apos; the provision of British naval, militaryand air force officers to serve in an advisory capacity &quot; with the iraqi Forces.(c) To bear the entire cost of the force which the Iraqi Government agreed toprovide for the defence of our two air bases. (N.B.--His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have never asked for this force see 3 (c) below).3.   In return Iraq accepted the following obligations :. (a) In the event of an imminent menace of war, to concert with us immedi-ately the necessary measures of defence. In the event of war or the imminent menace of war the aid which Iraq would give Great britain would consist of affording &quot; all facilities and assistance includingthe use of railways, rivers, ports, aerodromes, and means ofcommunication.&quot;(&amp;) The recognition that &apos;&apos; the permanent maintenance and protection inall circumstances &apos;&apos; of essential British communications were a common interest. For this purpose, and in order to facilitate the dischargeof our obligations to defend Iraq in case of war, Iraq undertook to grant for the duration of the alliance sites for air bases (sub-sequently fixed at Habbaniya and Shaiba). In a subsequent note the term &quot; essential communications &quot; was held to refer to air communica-tions over Iraq, and to sea and air communications at the head ofthe Persian Gulf and in the Shatt-el-Arab. The Forces which HisMajesty&apos;s Government were authorised to maintain at these air baseswere to comprise R.A.F. Units, together with ancillary services. Itis explicitly stated that the presence of these forces shall not constitutein any way an occupation and will in no way prejudice the sovereignrights of Iraq.(c) To provide (at our request and at the expense of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment) special guards for the protection of these air bases. In a noteattached to the Treaty it was agreed that in time of emergencyHis Majesty&apos;s Government should be authorised, in case the specialguards should, after consultation with the Government of Iraq, beconsidered inadequate for the defence of the air bases, to reinforcesuch guards temporarily by British land forces. (In fact His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have never requested the Iraqis to provide such specialguards and have made a friendly arrangement with them wherebyfor the present the Royal Air Force recruit and maintain their ownlevies in Iraq for this purpose.)(d) To afford at the request of His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;all possiblefacilities &apos;&apos; for the movement of British forces of all arms &apos;&apos; in transitacross Iraq.&quot; The expression &quot;in transit across Iraq&quot; is dennedto mean transit from any place west of the Euphrates to the persian gulf, or in the opposite direction.
(&amp;) Should the Iraqis consider it necessary to engage foreign militaryinstructors, to choose these from among British subjects; any Iraqipersonnel sent abroad for military training would be sent to militaryschools, colleges and training centres in British territory; the arma-ment and essential equipment of the Iraqi forces would not differ intype from those of British forces.(/) Normally to engage British subjects when in need of the services offoreign officials. Such officials would be selected after consultation between the two Governments. It was understood that this wouldnot prejudice the freedom of the Iraqi Government to engage non-British foreign officials for posts for which suitable British subjectswere not available.4. The Treaty provides that it shall remain in force until 1957, but thatat the request of either party a new treaty will be concluded at any time after1952 which shall provide for the continued maintenance and protection in all circumstances of our essential communications.Note. By an exchange of notes in September 1946 His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have already agreed to drop one provision in. the Treaty, namely, thatwhereby the British Ambassador in Bagdad should have permanent precedenceover his colleagues while the Iraqi representative in Tendon was to have the tank of Minister. Since this concession was agreed, the United States Govern-ment have appointed an Ambassador to Bagdad and the Iraqi Government have appointed an Ambassador to London.
