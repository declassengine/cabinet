THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1947 .      *Q*CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No. 3 .1CP. (47) 27129th September, 1947CABINETINTERNATIONAL MEETINGSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in accordance with Cabinet Conclusions (CM. (47) 74th Conclusions) of 25thAugust, I circulate herewith to my colleagues the recommendations of the steering Committee on International Organisations on reducing the number ofinternational meetings and the size of United Kingdom delegations to them.Apart from the specific meetings which, it is proposed, should be postponedor abandoned (Annex B), I suggest that the recommendations in the Committee&apos;s paper should be regarded as being for the general guidance of Departments, Whichthey should bear in mind when decisions have to be taken about the holding of individual international meetings in future.E- B.Foreign Office,29th September, 1947INTERNATIONAL MEETINGSSubjectThe Cabinet on 25th August instructed the Official Steering Committee on international Organisations to report on-(a) The possibility of securing the postponement of less essential interna-tional meetings;(b) The possibility of limiting the size of United Kingdom delegations.I. Postponement of Meetings2. The Committee was asked to divide the meetings upon which recom-mendations were submitted into two categories : -Category A. Those the postponement of which would seriouslyembarrass or inconvenience His Majesty&apos;s Government.Category B: Those the postponement of which would not seriouslyembarrass His Majesty&apos;s Government.recommendations. Lists prepared in accordance with this classification are attached asAnnexes A and B respectively. The Committee has confined its recommendations to intergovernmental meetings anticipated during the remainder of 1947, or inthe course of 1948, at which His Majesty&apos;s Government will be represented bymore than three individuals. Intra-Commonwealth meetings have been excludedas outside the scope of the Cabinet instructions:If the recommendations of the Committee were carried out, fourteeninternational meetings at present scheduled would be postponed.14338   34292 .

Supporting A rguments5. In reaching its conclusions as to the meetings to be included in categories A and B, the Committee was guided by the following principles : that His Majesty&apos;s Government should press for the postponement of allmeetings falling within the definition in paragraph 3 above which are not-(i) essential for either economic and social reconstruction or for urgenttechnical reasons;(ii) of a kind the postponement of which would either make it impossible tohold a full conference included in Category A at the desired date oigreatly extend its duration.6. Apart from inter-governmental meetings coming within the definition inparagraph 3 above, a large number of international meetings are held which areonly partially governmental in character (e.g., conferences of learned societiessponsored by a Government with a proportion of other governmental representa-tives), and the Committee considered that in deciding whether His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should be represented at and/or encourage these meetings thefollowing principles should be applied : 1(i) only those meetings should be held which are to deal with urgent problemsof reconstruction or pressing technical questions; ,(ii) to avoid overlapping these meetings should,, wherever appropriate, bebrought under the aegis of the specialised agency concerned.7j The Committee considers that Departments should apply the criteria inparagraph 6 (i) and (ii) above most strictly when ^considering the attitude to beadopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards any projected meeting of thiskind.&apos;:.;.,,.. - - &quot; -   - - &apos;8. The Committee also submits the following general recommendationstowards reducing expenditure on international meetings :  (i) In suitable cases His Majesty&apos;s Government should press for conferencesto be held outside hard currency countries; preferably in the UnitedKingdom or Western Europe;(ii) Agenda should, in all cases be restricted to the necessary minima, andbe so arranged that the attendance of experts and representatives fromspecialised agencies can be limited in duration when their interests are confined to Specific items only;(iii) The Secretary-General of the United Nations should be invited to draw the attention of all United Nations bodies and specialised agenciesto the potential contribution of good chairmanship to time-saving atinternational meetings;(iv) That meetings of the governing bodies of specialised agencies should beheld in close association with their annual conferences;(v) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should press for regional meetings of specialised agencies to toe confined to subjects clearly requiringregional action. Further, representation should be confined to countries of the region concerned and the representation of colonial territories be normally left to Colonial Governments, provided, ofcourse, that their voting rights could be assured;(vi) That United Kingdom delegations to all international meetings should.be on the watch for and strongly resist the tendency on the part ofIthese meetings to multiply ifche number of their subsidiary bodiesholding independent meetings. --\II. Limitation of Size of United Kingdom DelegationsRecommendations9. (i) That, although the advantages of United Kingdom delegations to the.General Assembly and Council Meetings of the United Nations andother international conferences at which important apolitical issues,were likely to arise being led by a delegate of ministerial rank wereappreciated by the Committee, reductions might on occasion be made-in the number of alternate delegates, particularly those of ministerialrank.
318S(ii) That there is no need always to send the total statutory number of delegates and alternates prescribed for any meeting.(iii) That the number of officials from Departments not primarily respon-v:   :        sible for any matter to be discussed by the conference should be kept&apos; to a minimum. ; ;(iv) That the duration of attendance of expert advisers should be limited tothe essential minimum.(v) Although the principle in (iv) above applies, also to junior staff, thenumbers and length of attendance of junior staff should not be reducedto an extent which would entail risk of a United Kingdom delegationbeing inadequately served, since an under-manned machine is not onlyinefficient but uneconomic.(vi) That as wide use as possible should be made of the services of personnel of His Majesty&apos;s permanent Missions abroad.Comment10. Whilst bearing in mind the urgent need for economy, the Committee alsotook into account the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not wish to sacrifice-fice beyond what was absolutely necessary the great prestige acquired by theUnited Kingdom owing to the efficiency and energy of its delegations to inter-national conferences. The Committee felt that, if United Kingdom represen-tation is desirable at an international meeting, it should be adequate to make our contribution effective.Final Recommendation11. With respect to the recommendations in both Parts I and II above, theCommittee considers that responsibility for applying the foregoing principles should rest with Departments primarily responsible for each particular conference,subject to such degree of departmental reference to the Treasury as may be laiddown.34292
