Minister of food the attached paper shows why the estimated rate of savings,measured in terms of imports.) -resulting from the decision ofAugust 1st last to suspend the placing of all further orders for .foodstuffs from hard currency sources,  can only be realised over Vperiod of time.-    The actual monthly rate of saving of imports is bound to fall short, of the estimate during&quot; the early months, but;will rise to the estimated rate by about&apos; the middle of next year,and would,  if the suspension of purchases were continued, exceed &quot;theestimated rate in the,second, half of&apos; 19h8.. -Short of ,breaking.long term contracts, with all the exceedinglygrave consequences which this would, involve,, the only way of shorteningthe time-lag before,, the reduction in Imports reaches the estimated level(would be to.place foodstuffs purchased from dollar sources under long-term contracts in- store,  instead of distributing them on the ration. .Even in this case, of course, no actual dollar savings would be realised in the period in question (i.e, until well into 1949) but the higherstocks which would be created could no doubt be notianally regarded as equivalent to a saving.    Moreover, the extent to which such a stocking-up policy could be carried would be limited by the amount of storage,Particularly cold storage, available and the fact that some foods, e.g.meat, bacon, eggs,, cannot be held in store for more than, a limited period without serious deterioration.The possibility of actual dollar savings would only arise as and&quot;hen our long-term contracts-terminate.     As ;the attached note &apos;Appendix A)  shows,: none of the more significant long-term contractsV 1. &apos; ^ &apos;.-::&apos;r: -
terminates before the end of 19U8&apos;, and some of then run on into1950s though in these latter oases the existence of price., revisionclauses might enable&apos; us to terminate them at- an earlier date. ;  It .: &apos;&apos;OOv.lv;::^ -O.&apos;   O^a^O-OO&apos;^1;&apos; a:O^-^:0f.-O:O.Oa::&apos;would, only, be at these dates that the existence of larger stocks in&apos;this country might enable actual dollars to be saved by a decisionto renew the contracts on smaller quantities. -On the other hand,&apos; the nutritional effect of putting any significant quantity of the foodstuffs which will &quot;arrive during the- ./&apos;/.&apos; &apos;-&quot; .&apos;,::   :&apos;   ;W;V--:-&apos;.-&apos;&apos; 0;VV&quot; &apos;o&apos;&quot; V^la&apos;&apos;;:&apos;, &apos;-&quot;-.        - -0 d&apos;!:/y     &apos; &apos;-&apos;&apos; &apos;   0.:&apos;&apos;dnext eighteen months into stock piling would be very grave.

consumers are - obtaining a definitely-inadequate ration, and symptomsof malnutrition are. bound -to- appear, and have in fact appeared.In these circumstances, to place foodstuffs which are actuallycoming into the country into stock in order to -begin to obtain afoliar saving in 19^+9, would-, I suggest, be to increase and not todecrease the very-serious risks which this country must in any case .face.      The still lower level of nutrition which such a policy of stock piling must inevitably produce, must,  in my view, react sharplyupon production and so upon the export drive.      It would be likely,therefore, to defeat its own object and to increase and not diminish the gap in the balance of payments.J.S.Ministry-of Food,S.W * 1. -Fth October, 19U7.
?MThe Food Imporort Programme 19U7/U8 from Hard-Currency CountriesMote by Minister of Food.ne 30th, 1948 has been subjected to two cuts;.-The food import programme for the period July 1st, I9I+ / to(a)(b) 50 million in terms of imports^ during- the year;the effect of discontinuing all purchases from hard currency countries from hth August, 19h7, except inthe case of continuing contracts (a policy so fardecided upon by the Cabinet up to the end of 1947only - CM. (47) 67th Conclusions , Minute 2).2.      In applying the first cut the Ministry of Food was able, by   -selecting the appropriate foodstuff s,. to ensure that it became fully effective in terms of arrivals before 30th June,. 19U8&apos;.3-     It is much :nore difficult to estimate in advance the effect ofthe second cut upon imports during the year, as imports during anyparticular period represent purchases arranged at a much earlier date..U.      Consequently reductions in imports in any particular period mustnot he regarded as synonymous with the savings in expenditure - achieved in the same period.    . The savings resulting from the cessation of .Purchasing can only show themselves in terms of imports some considerable time after the decision to stop buying became effective.This does not mean that the hoped for saving in dollars will notultimately be achieved;    only that  it will not show itself in reducedimports until a later date. :/     &apos;/5.      On 2.9th July,  19U7?  a very approximate estimate was made of thereduction, which might be expected in imports up to- the end of the year if foodstuffs planned to be imported but to which we were not actuallycommitteed were not &apos; bought.    The figure was  72 million.6.   .   It seems to have been assumed in some quarters that discontinuance of purchasing.on hth August would result in savings in imports at therate of  12 million a month up to the end of the year./..     This was unjustified as the figure of  72 million was the resultof a very quick review of the programme and a further more detailedreview (just concluded)  shows that a much larger quantity of food
programmed, for import after 1st July, I9U.7, had already been purchased, contracted for or was afloat, than was thought at thequick review-.8..     If it was&apos; expected that as a &quot;result of stopping all buying fromhard currency.&quot;:sources that the food import, programme for 19h7/h8would- show -a reduction of  50 million plus- lg.li million . (i.e.12 months at  12 million a month)--it - must he- admitted for the reasons give ab.6ve that this cannot be achieved.      The saving in purchaseswill, however^ be nearer to this figure than-the reduction in imports.In the period following a decision to cut any expenditure the&quot;reduction in imports, which will be visible and calculable, must obviously be substantially &quot;smaller than the saving of expenditure,;but the latter is not calculable because departments have neverworked on the.basis of a phased-programme of expenditure comparable with the import programme.9.      Nevertheless it  is estimated that if the present policy is continued after 31st December; 19U7, the rate of reduction of imports -in the latter half .. of 19I+8 will have risen to -a figure well in excess&quot;of  12 million a &quot;month.      But the- discontinuance of purchases savedloliars immediately and continues  to do so,10.    If the ban on all purchases from hard currency sources could have resulted in a reduction of  imports of  1U1+ million35 by the 30th June,19U8,. in addition to the previous flat cut of  50 million a total reduction of  19^ million would have been realised.    The revisedImport programme recently submitted by- the Ministry of Poo61 to theExchange Requirements Committee shews a reduction on the original.programme of.  h2 million in July-December,- 19h7*  and  75 million- in-_&apos;_&apos;___._____ /January_x   Assuming that the  reduction in imports could have been at anaverage fate of  12 million a month the total reduction up to  .30th June, 1948,  could only be,  132 million since the- decisionto impose the ban on expenditure was only taken on 1st August,I9h7. &apos; &apos;-   V -.  &apos;    &apos; -   &apos;   - : &quot;
January - June,  1948- - i.e.  a total of  117 million.     But in the six months July - December,  194-8,  the reduction in imports-, on thebasis of continuing the present policy,  and on present estimates of price levels, would, amount to a further  loLi/a)&apos; million provided thatHp additional supplies- are needed for special purposes.%11.    S-eeing that it is not possible to achieve the  194 millionreduction in imports during 1947/48 the suggestion has been putforward that we should maintain our present programme (i.e. of importing from hard currency countries only foods for which contractsare- in -existence) ,  reduce current consumption and place temporarily in stock the quantities so saved.12.    This would mean a saving in purchases at some future date (i.e.when the existing contracts for those goods expire).   With triflingexceptions, it would not mean any reductions in imports or.expenditurein 1947/48 as practically all the contracts- in question do not fallfor renewal until after the expiration of that period.13&quot;&apos; The only advantage of such a policy of reducing consumption would he that it would strengthen our&apos;-future stocky position,  so thatwhen the time comes we should have more room to move in deciding our policy in respect of contracts for further, periods .o;? be able to -&apos;contemplate even more drastic measures during 1948 if the situation-then makes further cuts-in purchases necessary.      On the other hand,it would mean increased austerity now - involving reductions in thestandard of.living over and above those which have already been imposed (e.g. reductions in the meat and tea rations and in thesupply of milk and a cut in &quot;points&quot;)  and those which are inevitableon other grounds (evgv the restriction of potato consumptionsreductions in the bacon and butter rations)..; - ;v j.s. sjjth October. 1947.. -     .Ministry of Food,, S.f.l.   1 - -[a) - This figure was  110 million when discussed with the Treasury.But- allowance has now been made for the increased cost - of- Canadian wheat in the second half of 1948 as a consequence ofthe recent agreement with the Canadians.
