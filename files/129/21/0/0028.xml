HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT)     tSECRETC.P.(h7)  278 COPY NO.    &quot;016TH OCTOBER.  1QZj7 &apos;    &apos;-cabinet trade NEGOTIATIONS IN GENEVA:_TARIFF discussions with THE U.S.A.Memorandum by the President- of the Board of Ij?ade.1.. In C.P.(h7) 2h5 of 27th August, my predecessorreported on the then state of the Geneva negotiations and was authorised to endeavour to reach agreement.on the basis -(a) &apos;  that- the offers already made by us up to that point.should stand;(b) that we should meet the United States- new andheavily reduced requests for elimination and reduction ofpreference in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South africa to the extent of increasing our offers- of elimination from a trade coverage of  1,6 million to  3.0 million, while.leavingour offer of reductions at  16.3 million.      (India was not considered in this connection);..  (c)    that we should endeavour to secure important&apos; additional concessions by the Americans.     Those contemplatedwere:-(i)    a reduction of their statutory requirement,that 33i per cent, of rubber used inmanufacture should be synthetic;(ii)   &apos;a reduction of their internal taxation on imported vegetable oils;(iii).   a reform of their Customs Administration.2. These proposed offers were, of course, discussed withthe Commonwealth countries concerned and as a result of their observations the offer to the Americans   under   ( b) above was putforward as -Eliminations    1.6 m.  (old) plus  1.2 m.  (new)Reductions&apos;       16.3 m.  (old)  plus  1.5 m. (new;India was again left out of account at-   this stage.3. As regards the points under (c) above, it was decided,in consultation with the- Colonial Office,  to omit vegetable oils(which would have been&apos; in fact of little value during the   present world shortage of fats) in order to concentrate on rubber, and asregards customs administration to be content with the provisions
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and. Trade, since the americans cannot apply this Agreement definitely (as opposed toprovisionally) without legislating on this and v. number of othermatters.The Americans at this stage decisively rejected theproposal about rubber and when the then President reported again to the Cabinet on 20th September (CP.(hi) 266)  the question was whether Mr. Clayton&apos;s proposal that we should go much further(though partly on a delayed-action basis) in the matter of preferences - against the    offer already made by the United states was rejected.5* Mr. Clayton &quot;was accordingly handed a letter setting forth our view on this and declining to make any further concessions unless the scope of the United States offers werewidened.     The U.S. Ambassador, who called on the Foreign Secretarybefore leaving for Washington, represented that the  terms of theletter might be understood as indicating a decision on our part to break off the negotiations.      The Foreign Secretary and thePresident agreed that it should be made clear to the UnitedStates Charge d&apos;Affaires that this was not our intention andthat we were entirely prepared for negotiations to continue.The offers already made were not immutable but were subject toadjustment and discussion within the Cabinet&apos;s concept of a proper balance between the offers on both sides.     It wastherefore entirely open for the negotiators in Geneva to go through the lists and make suggestions,  but i-t&quot;cbuld not beexpected that the United Kingdom side would be able to departfrom the overall balance as presented to the- Cabinet.6. I now have to report that Mr. Clayton&apos;s deputy in Genevahas approached the head of our Delegation and has asked him toconsider certain proposals on a purely personal basis.Mr. Clayton&apos;s deputy said that he had in mind certain additionalconcessions by both sides, which, he hoped, might enable thenegotiations to be carried to a successful conclusion.     The headof the United Kingdom Delegation said that, if it was   understoodthat we must have adequate compensation, he was prepared to listen and to explore the possibilities in an entirely non-committal fashion.      But he could not,  and did not,  hold out any hope that the Cabinet would be prepared to reconsider their previous decision.      He made it clear on the other hand thatthere was in fact not more than a chance of accommodation on sucha basis of extended concessions on both sides.7. It proved that the Americans desired some few further concessions on the preferences we enjoy in Commonwealth markets and in return would be ready to see in:what way,  and how far,they could meet our request on rubber.      They also brought up thequestion of the preference granted by us to Southern Rhodesiantobacco.      A few other minor adjustments of no great significancewere also mentioned.8. It is my understanding that Mr. Clayton&apos;s deputy is.now recommending to his Government that these proposals, which are described In greater detail below,  should be accepted.     No doubt was left in his mind that if a solution on these lines was to bereached,  there was no question of their asking us to throw in alittle more.     Equally Mr. Clayton&apos;s deputy said that the head ofour Delegation must   understand that this solution must beaccepted as a whole,  or else rejected.9. The additional requests as regards preferences we enjoy
are -(a) In Canada.:      elimination of the preference on certaingoods made of cotton and on either tinplcte or blackplate.These are both largely window dressing items which should not-hurt us since the specialities in the cotton items which welargely supply have been reserved and on these the preferencewill be retained.      The Canadians have moreover laid down two new strip mills,  so that, even when, we are again in a conditionto supply tinplate and blackplate,  we shall probably find thatthere is little demand for imports.      Both items are of greatimportance to the Canadians from a protective point and theywould therefore have to eliminate the preference by a moderateincrease in the rate charged on our imports.(b) In India:      elimination of the preference   on passengermotor ears and   parts (but not trucks or omnibuses),  to beeffected in six years.      The preference at present is only 9 percent,  ad valorem, and the proposal is to eliminate    in three-equal steps.      It was not surprising that the Americans should ask for this since no other preference of ours in India isbeing eliminated and only one- of significance   is being reduced.The Canadians do not receive preferential treatment in India andwould therefore benefit equally with the Americans.      The Indiansfor their part are most anxious that- we should consent, since they, in turn need this concesssion to finalise their ownagreement with the U.S.A.  and have indicated that they areprepared to make some counter concession to us if we do agree.The motor car manufacturers will not be pleased,  but there is something to be said for getting the maximum price- for giving up a. relatively small preference. whi ch the Indians themselvesmay well take away from us before long unilaterally and withoutpayment.      We may,  in fact, be selling a. dying horse.(c) In the Colonies (except Ceylon):      the Americans have all along been anxious for a concession on preference    in the -Colonies to be included, as it was   in the 1938 Trade Agreement.The suggestion is that,  on any items scheduled to the 1938Agreement on which we enjoy a preference,  the margin should be. reduced by a quarter.      In no case would any margin be eliminated.This concession would not have to be fully implemented beforethe end of 19*l9 in order to give time for the necessary actionto be taken in the Colonies.      Preservation of three quarters of existing margins should be adequate to prevent any serious damage to United Kingdom interests as e result;    a typicalexample would be the narrowing of existing rates of 30 per cent,foreign and 20 per cent, preferential to either 27-g- and 20 or30 and 22-g- or something betv/een the two.      In any case it willbe possible for the United Kingdom and the Colonies to discriminate &apos;in each other&apos;a favour, for as long as we are in balance of payments difficulties,  since they have a common quotain the International   Monetary Fund.      It should be added that nothing in the present proposal in any way impedes plans for a customs Union of the United Kingdom and   its Colonies.10.   &apos;    -    on rubber,   the previous^rican ^  ;fonlargely on the difficulty of Mtpoauoin^r to din shortly eJQaa subject which is due to c^^^^,?0^3Son. This difficulty which is,  in American- eyes,  c 9^guld be free to with-MS SSSSS KXSc^ st T ur fhS,
On the assumption that Congress will,  in the absence of such anarrangement,   accept the proposal of the Batt report to have asynthetic rubber industry producing 250,000 tons yearly,  the concession would be worth as much as  I4..7 million annually inextra.dollar earnings (nearly fit- million of which would accruedirectly to our Colonies) when American consumption falls to750,000 tons,  as well it may.11. Thus the balance of the extra concessions as theydirectly effect the United Kingdom may be summarised as follows:-:   &apos; ti v- W^M :   ..^-;^--::ViV.-\^...-&apos;noncessions&apos; by U.K.U.-S. stands to gainon trade valued in1938 inCanadaIndiaColoniesa Li.If 0.7 millionSO. 5 2.511        (smallreductions inpreferences only)Concessions bv U.S. A.When consumption of rubber in U.S.A.  is1.00.9     0.8     0.7 million tornWe secure extra, dollarsin the world worth   nil   1.9     3*8.     5.6     million and in our Colonies worth       nil    1.5     3*0     I4..5     million12. There remains,  however,   the question of tobacco.      Thesuggestion is that we should ask Southern Rhodesia to consent to a conditional reduction in the preference of 1/6-Jd, per lb.which she now enjoys to l/3d. when our own tobacco duty goeshalf way back to the pre-budget rate, and to 1/- when it goesthe whole way back. &apos;    Granted&quot; the preoccupations   of the U.S.A.with preferences,  this is a moderate request from their point ofview, in that- it asks for a reduction of one-third in the margin of preference and that only when our taxation of smokers is reduced,  1. e. when the-demand for tobacco may be expected to be-on the up grade.     But from our own point of view there could notbe a subject more difficult to handle in view of the attentionwhich has been attracted to it in recent months and the suggestions(which although based on a misapprehension as to availabilities of empire tobacco are nevertheless firmly believed by many)that the Americans are using the- non-discrimination obligations .of the Loan Agreement to prevent us from securing the maximum, of tobacco from Empire sources.13. Prom the point of view of Southern Rhodesia the questionis probably even more .awkward.      It has not been found possible at Geneva for Southern Rhodesia to reach any basis of agreementwith any other negotiating country and the delegations of theU.S.A., Prance, Benelux and Canada have all made it clear that without some contribution by Southern Rhodesia they would refuseto admit her as a party to the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade.      The Americans have, however,  said that if SouthernRhodesia were to consent to their proposed conditional reductionof the tobacco preference they would withdrew all their out-standing requests on her and would support her admission to theGeneral&apos;Agreement.      There ia no doubt- that other countries concerned would follow the American lead in this matter.      I feel
myself thct we are bound to inform the -Government   of SouthernRhodesia of the position, but the lead which we should give.depends on our decision on the main issue.     We.might conceivablyget round our own political difficulty if we were to say publiclyat the appropriate time that we had told the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia that we are ready and anxious to conclude anagreement with them for a long term contract for our tobaccosupplies.      Such a contrrct would be welcome to them, I hope, andwould solve their problem as to the future of their tobaccoindustry, but would be a sore spot with the Americans.     Itcould,  however,  be defended under the proposed I.T.O. Charteras being based on commercial considerations.12+. Talcing the proposal as a whole, my conclusion wouldbe that judged purely from the point of view of the UnitedKingdom trade on our own and the Colonies balance of payments with the United States5  the prospect of increased sales&quot; of rubbermakes it just possible to say that an agreement on these lines would be,  on balance,  advantageous.      On the other hand, theinclusion of the proposal on tobacco is, from the point of viewof internal United Kingdom politics,  a real difficulty.      Andthere are the- -known views of the Government of Southern Rhodesiaabout tobacco,     Against this, from the Commonwealth point ofview, must be set the keen desire of the Canadian Governmentthat we should conclude an Agreement with the United Statesespecially at the present time...      It is, after all,  a cardinalpoint of Canadian policy that we and the Americans should notdisagree. - .15. Even so, my own feeling would be that an agreement on the lines suggested stands or falls on&quot;the -view taken abouttobacco.      Unless the Government of Southern Rhodesia agree thata long term contract enables them to accept, my advice from thepoint of view of trade and political reactions would be that weshould say no.16. But there are of course even wider considerations which have already been before the Cabinet,  though in the content of a different proposal.      The whole project of an International,Trade Organisation,   to which we are fully committed, and whichwe have many times said is greatly to our long term interest ifwe are ever to secure an expansion of world trade, really standsor falls by en agreement on tariffs and preferences between ourselves.end the U.8.A.      A breach with the U.S.A. mightdeprive us of the hope of getting the last  2+00 million of the credit released and might well lead to unfavourable reaction onMarshall Aid and more particularly on our share of it,  and even to much more serious and far-reaching consequences in the field of foreign policy generally.      In the light of these factors,I feel it would be wrong that the matter should be settled inthe light of the trade and internal political considerationspointed to before my colleagues had an opportunity of consideringthe matter in ell its aspects what amounts to a fresh proposal from the American side.17. Since time is short, I have taken the first opportunityof circulating this report to my colleagues.      I hope to have anopportunity, before we meet to discuss it,  of going more fully into the. question with the Foreign Secretary arid the Minister for economic Affairs.H.W.Board of Trade, S.W.  1.,6th October, 19U7.
