A summary of their main-conclusions; is at Annex I and of the military, arguments in support of these conclusions at Annex II.A..V.A.Ministry of Defence,.S.W.118th September,  19^+7.
ANNEX I summary of Chiefs of Staffs Conclusions(a) The military problems presented by the agreement of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to implement either of the two proposals would be:-(i) The Majority Piano      The imposition by force of some.Colonial type of government in the Arab State,the safeguarding of the Jewish State and theprotection of British life and property throughoutthe Middle East.      This would entail appreciablereinforcement of the existing Middle East garrisonwith appropriate naval and air supports(ii) The Minority Plan.      It would be impossible to implement this plan against greatly increasedopposition from the Jews and it would be necessaryto impose by force a Colonial type of government.Provided there was no appreciable Arab resistance,no reinforcement would be required but the present strength of our forces would have to bemaintained.(b) The provision of reinforcements or the maintenance ofour present strength beyond the planned run-down would entail a drastic revision of our Defence Policy.(c) The long term effects upon our strategic position in theMiddle East after either of the two proposals had been implemented by us would be:-(i) The Majority Plan.      Even if we conclude some treaty with the Jewish Successor State giving us local military rights, it would be at the immediate and lasting expense of our overriding strategic require-ment of retaining Arab goodwill,  and would therebyrender impossible of achievement the firm strategichold in the Middle East which is an indispensableand vitally important part of Imperial defence policy.(ii) The Minority Plan.      During the transitional period(which seems likely in practice to be indefinite).  our strategic requirements would be secured subjectto our being able to provide and maintain thenecessary forces.      If Federation was ever achieved,we might be able to secure a satisfactory treaty with the Successor State, depending upon the- attitude of the Federal Government,  our relationship with the other Arab States and the international situation.It is important to realise that unless it ispolitically possible to conclude satisfactorytreaties with the independent States created,under neither plan can our long term strategic requirements in Palestine be obtained.
(&amp;)    If His Majesty&apos;s Government declined to implement eitherproposal and decided to withdraw,(i) The decision might he impossible to implement.It. would in any cose present considerablemilitary difficulties.(ii) It may be taken as a further sign of weaknessand lack of determination to maintain ourposition in the Middle East.(iii) The only way to secure our long term strategic requirements will be by Treaty with the SuccessorStates.      Our demonstration of weakness inwithdrawing in the face of difficulty, from an area as strategically vital as Palestine, may wellconvince these Successor States,  and the arab world as a whole, that Treaties with us ore of little practical value.The Chiefs of Staff wish to emphasise the overriding importance to our strategical position which they attach tothe retention of the goodwill of the Arab States and of the moslem world as a whole.
ANNEX IIMILITARY ARGUMENTS ON WHICH CONCLUSIONS recorded in ANNEX I ARE BASED     &quot; -Report by the Chiefs of StaffWe have examined the solutions proposed in theReport of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine..0n the advice of the Foreign Office, we have assumed that HisMajestj^s Government will, in either of the solutions proposed,be asked to give effect to the Assembly&apos;s recommendation,&quot;though it will be for His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide whetheror not they are prepared to undertake this responsibility.2* The military arguments recorded below ore specificallyin answer to the following three questions:-(a) What ore the immediate   military problems which wouldbe presented by the agreement   of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to implement either of the two proposals contained in the Report of the United NotionsCommittee?(b) What would be the long term effects upon our strategic position in the Middle East,  after effect had beengiven to either of the two proposals by means ofBritish action?(c) If His Majesty&apos;s Government declined to implementeither proposal,  and if the United Nations were ableto devise other,means of giving effect to the irrecommendation, with the result that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment withdrew from Palestine almost immediately,what would be the strategic consequences of this development?Our Military Requirements in Palestine3* We- consider below these questions against the strategic,importance of Palestine and our military requirements in thatcountry.      These remain as given in a report&quot; which wo prepared in January last.      After the successful implementation of -eitherplan,  they can only be ensured if it is politically possible to conclude treaties with the Successor States,THE MAJORITY PLANk* Under this plan the Jews achieve an autonomous jewish state,  sovereignty over the major portion of the land ofPalestine, domination of an Arab minority including the Bedouinsamounting to about k5 per cent,  of the total population of theirState (more than a third of all the Arabs in Palestine),  and theright to introduce Into Palestine a larger flow of immigrantsthan they have ever hod before.      These advantages to the Je?/sore conversely.serious disadvantages to the Arabs.      There is inaddition the further disadvantage from the Arab point of viewthat the town and port of Jaffa is included in the Jewish State.Reactions of Jews and Arabs in Palestine5*      Jews.      The Jews ore likely to realise that the adoptionof the Majority Plan would be the maximum that they could hope to achieve at the present stage, though the extremists might continue agitation for on all-Jewish independent Palestine.+   An extract from this Report (circulated as-D.0.(1+7) 3)  is included as an Appendix to thepresent report.
6*     Arabs,    There can be little doubt that any action bythe Administrative Authority in charge of Palestine even todelimit the frontiers would precipitate serious disordersamongst the Arabs in the Jewish State.     In the area.allocated to the Arab State,  there would probably be similar disordersaccompanied by absolute refusal to participate in theelections for the proposed Constituent Assembly.     Thevehemence and solidarity of the Arab reaction would beincreased by the arrival of Jewish immigrants at&apos; the high rate of 150,000 in ,two years.     In these circumstances itwould be impossible to set up the Arab State, and order couldonly be maintained by some type of Colonial government imposed by force.The Arab disorders, which would be supported byirregulars and volunteers from Transjordan, Syria and Lebanon,would begin with terrorist attacks on Jews and Jewish property.These&apos;disorders unless resolutely suppressed, might laterdevelop into attacks and sabotage on all alien property and personnel in the country.Reactions in neighbouring Arab countries7^ There con be no dojibt that, if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment undertook to impose this plan, all the .Arab states would regard our action as a breach of faith,  and anti-Britishreaction might be expected throughout the Arab countries.In^ addition,  the possibility-must not be ignored of an attempt by&apos;King Abdullah to seize the opportunities  ty...of-realising hisGreater Syria scheme and the consequent and violent reaction of King Ibn Saud.Immediate Military Problems8. While we should probably have to contend with only small scale terrorist action on the part of the- Jews, it isclear that Arab reaction would present a problem of considerablmagnitude.     Not only would there be the task of maintaininglaw and order in Palestine but there would also be the commitment of meeting attacks on British personnel and property throughout the Middle East,  and disturbancesthroughout the Moslem world.9- We expressed the view^in Januaryof this year that under similar circumstances additionalforces of the order of one division would be required tothose stationed in the Middle East at that time.     Our forcesin the Middle East have,.however, been reduced since thebeginning of the year.-     While we are unable at present tostate the precise degree of reinforcement that might nowbe required, we think that it would be appreciably greaterthan previously estimated,  even if we were prepared to acceptassistance from the Jewish Defence forces within their ownstate.       ....../   D.0.(h.7) 3
The provision of such reinforcements would necessitate v. drastic revision of our present defence policy.Long Term effects,; ,on our strategic position10. The retention of Arab goodwill in the middle east is one of our essential strategic requirements.Even if we could conclude some treaty with the JewishSuccession State when it achieved independence giving uslocal military rights,  it would he ,a.t the immediate and lasting expense of this major strategic requirement.THE MINORITY PLAN11. , The Minority plan, which proposes a federationof Jewish and /,rab provinces, can by its nature only be implemented if the two communities agree to co-operate tosome extent.     At present there seems no likelihood thatthis will occur.The proposed constitution provides for an arbitralbody, which will be preponderantly Arab, to settle anyissues which have reached a deadlock in the legislativesystem.      If the federation is established, Arab viev/s will therefore in the last resort prevail.Reaction of the tv/o communities in Palestine12*      Arabs.      In view of the advantages of this plan tothe Arabs, when compared with partition, it may bepossible to persuade them eventually to acquiesce infederation,  in spite of their present attitude.     Theiracquiescence would probably be most reluctant, however,since they will object on principle to any form of Jewishencroachment on to territory which they regard as theirown.13.      Jews.     Under the minority plan the Jewishaspirations for a Jewish State would not be satisfied and immigration,  though it might be higher than at present,would   not be as high as   under the majority plan.     Asettlement on these lines would be quite unacceptable tothe   Jews,  and any attempt to implement it would be met bythe boycotting of elections for a Constituent Assembly andan intensification of terrorism.      It is possible thatHagana might also give active support to the terrorists.Illegal immigration would continue.     The government ofthe country would therefore have to be carried out on colonial lines and maintained by force.
Reactions outside Palestine1U. Were the Arabs of Palestine to acquiesce in this plan, it is probable that the Arab States could also be persuaded to accept it.      In this event, we should not lose their goodwill and confidence by agreeing to implement the plan.Jewish opinion,  particularly in America, wouldharden against us and world Jewry would continue to supportillegal immigration and terrorism in Palestine.Immediate Military Problems15* Our forces now deployed in the Middle East are sufficient to maintain law and order in the face of theJewish community,  and provided there is no appreciable Arabresistance, reinforcements would not be required.      our forces are,  however,  planned to run-down in the near future to a point where there will be insufficient to deal even with Jewish opposition, which is likely to continue indefinitely.      They could only be maintained at theexpense of some other commitment.Provided that the Arab world had been persuaded to accept the Minority Plan no reinforcements would benecessary to our other garrisons in the Middle East.Long term effect on our strategic position16. The long term effect on our strategic positionin the Middle East can only be examined against the eventualoutcome of the proposed plan.      During the transitional period, which is planned, to last three years but may lastindefinitely if Jew and Arab cannot agree to co-operate,we should be responsible for the administration of thecountry.      During this time our strategic requirements would thus be&apos; secured,  subject to our continuing to beable to provide forces sufficient to maintain internal security.17. If it was even possible to establish a federal government and Palestine became independent, our strategic requirements could only be secured by means of a Treaty orother   agreement.      It is impossible,  at this stage, toestimate our chances of obtaining a satisfactory treaty,since this will depend upon the goodwill of the federal government,  our relationship with other Arab States atthat time, and the international situation.
CONSEQUENCES OP EARLY BRITISH WITHDRAWAL18. If His Majesty&apos;s Government-declines to implementeither proposal and withdraws from Palestine, the militarydifficulties involved will be considerable.     The result ofthe United Nations decision will be published before such a movement can take place and, however rapidly the United Nationsmay find an administration and the necessary forces to relieveus, it seems likely that a period of several months must elapse before a relief can be effected.     During this time we must- remain in control of Palestine,  since there is no alternative administration to which we could transfer power.It will be our task to curb the disorders and to maintain thestatus quo in Palestine until the arrival of the new administration.     United Nations might then,  in the event,find it impossible to effect a change in the administration, .and His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentVs decision to withdraw would thus.be impossible to implement.19. Assuming, however, that it is possible to hand overPalestine to some- other authority, whilst we consider thatsuch action must have an adverse effect upon our strategic requirements, the degree of such effect would depend uponthe identity of that authority.Russia, or any body containing a significantRussian element, would be entirely against our interests,whilst a U.S. dominated body might well prove comparativelyacceptable to us.     Apart from either of the above, it is most important that control should pass to a national orinternational authority friendly to us, and both willing and able to resist Russian encroachment.20. We consider that a decision to withdraw,  even ifclearly taken as a result of our refusal to participate in a plan we considered unjust to the Arabs, would be construed bythe latter as a sign of weakness;    they would consider we haddeserted them.     Furthermore, our absence from palestine would decrease our influence there and any chances ofobtaining eventually a satisfactory treaty with its government, would disappear.If America took over,  the safety of the Middle Eastagainst aggression would be ensured for the period of herauthority in Palestine.     On the other hand,  her policy duringthis time is unlikely to satisfy or conciliate the Arabs and upon the completion of her task end the withdrawal of herauthority there would be no guarantee of the security of theMiddle East, especially as in the meantime we should haveseverely damaged our own position and prestige.     Nor can wethink of any other power or combination of powers which wouldgive us even this temporary security.
APPENDIX-(Extract from D.0.(47) 3)STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF PALESTINEAny defence plan for the Middle East must centreon the defence of Egypt,  an essential base both for defenceend for the air counter-offensive.     The defence of Egypt canonly be conducted effectively against attaclcs from the northby holding Palestine.     In war,  therefore,  the security notonly of Egypt, but also of Palestine   is &quot;essential to thedefence of the Middle East.Palestine   in addition is of strategic importancebecause of the oil pipelines, both existing and projected,and their  terminals.      It also lies on the land and air route to Trans Jordan and Iraq.MILITARY REQUIREMENTS IN palestine in peace such forces as we wish to retain in theMiddle East must be located    in or near the area on which our defence will be based.      Under the Treaty now being negotiated with Egypt we shall not be permitted to stationsuch forces in her territory.     Sinoe for various reasons noother Middle East country except Palestine will at present-meet our requirements, we must be able to locate them in thelatter country if they are to be effective at the outbreakof war.At the outbreak, of war,  therefore, we must be ready in Palestine with such forces and airfields as we consider necessary to defend it end at the same time provide a deterrent force to counter the coming threat.Our requirements in Palestine can be summarisedas follows:-(a) Retention of full military rights in Palestine forthe purposes of organisation of defence.(b) The power to locate in Palestine such forces as our defence, interests require.      This will entail -(i)    The use of Haifa and possibly Gaza as a supply port and for operating such naval vessels as may be necessary;(ii)    The location of army forces with theiradministrative organisation within thecivil districts of Haifa, Lydda andGaza, and the sub-districts of Tulkarm,Nazareth and Beisan$(iii)    The use of an airfield system in thegeneral area of central Palestine,  togetherwith the necessary radar.,  administrative and supply organisations and the right to station our forces in these bases;
(c) The retention of complete freedom of movementin Palestine;(d) Suitable conditions so as to ensure the freeflow of oil to the Mediterranean terminals.If we are unable to obtain these requirements, our ability to, defend Palestine -r and therefore our whole strategic position in the Middle East - will be gravely -prejudiced.In addition to the above military requirements forthe defence of Palestine,  we would&apos;emphasise the strategicrequirement that any solution of the Palestine    problem must ensure the retention of the goodwill of the Arab world.Moreover,  stable conditions in Palestine are essential ifwe are to make full use in peacetime of the oil pipelinesand terminals in that country.
