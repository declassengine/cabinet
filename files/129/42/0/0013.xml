Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1950.SECRETCP. (50) 21325tk September, 1950CABINETKONGWA WORKING PARTY report memorandum by the Minister of food in accordance with the conclusions of the Cabinet on 18th September (CM. (50)60th Conclusions, Minute 5) I annex a copy of the report of the Working Partyappointed by the Overseas Food Corporation to advise on the future agricultural policy to be followed at Kongwa.2. After the Cabinefs discussion I postponed the arrangements for publishing the report and for taking the consequential administrative action in East Africa,which I had outlined in CP. (50) 208.3. An immediate decision must be taken on the policy to be followed inKongwa, because planting is due to begin there about the end of November. land has to be prepared before then and all the necessary administrative and preparatoryarrangements must be put in hand at once. The staff in Kongwa have to be giventhe programme on which they are to work, and we cannot await the revision ofthe Corporation^ long-term plan towards the end of November without postponingchanges in Kongwa for a whole year. If the original programme providing for alarge acreage under oil-bearing crops were maintained for another year theCorporation consider rightly in my view that they would be left defencelessagainst a charge of irresponsible management.4. My colleagues will see (from paragraphs 28 and 29 of the Report) that itis not proposed to embark hurriedly on large-scale cattle-ranching development.The Corporation have already had experience in Kongwa with a herd of some,500 cattle, and it is not intended to build the herd up to more than 4,000-5,000head for the time being. All the proposals on cattle-ranching are, of course, subjectto expert examination and advice, including a survey of the market for the cattle.Water will be a limiting factor, and there is no intention of creating a herd in excessof the water resources at present available. Hitherto ranching has been carriedout on the veldt perimeter of the cleared area and on a portion of the cleared area.In the first instance it is proposed to extend ranching over the rest of the clearedarea not required for agricultural use if the Working Party&apos;s proposals are adopted.But, at the same time, a survey would be made of the remaining 350,000 acres at kongwa, which were originally to be cleared for agriculture in order to assess thepossibilities for a further extension of ranching.5. Cattle are purchased at about  2 \0s. Od. per head and, after fatteningover one or two years, are sold at about  5 per head. One African herdsman looksafter 150-200 head of cattle, and little European supervision is required. TheCorporation assure me that,, only insignificant capital expenditure on such thingsas cattle dips will be required. There is, therefore, no large-scale expenditure involved in the proposal.6. The implementation of the report of the Working Party will involve someextensive administrative reorganisation in Kongwa. This will have to be completed before the planting season begins at the end of November. The Deputy Chairmanof the Corporation is already in East Africa for this purpose and the reorganisa-tion will begin at once if the proposals are approved. It has been arranged thatthe Tanganyika Government will be joined in the examination of the best way of using any buildings, stores, equipment and personnel which become surplus.Copy No.    32THIS   DOCUMENT IS  THE   PROPERTY  OF  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT
7. The Chairman of the Overseas Food Corporation is due to leave for EastAfrica on 29th September; if the proposals are approved, arrangements will bemade for him to announce the decision at a Press Conference on the afternoon of Thursday, 28th September, and for the report to be published the following day.8. I therefore urge my colleagues to authorise me to inform the Board of theCorporation that they may implement the recommendations of the KongwaWorking Party. The Secretary of State for the Colonies is in full agreement withthe course which I recommend.M. W.Ministry of Food, S.W. 1,25th September, 1950.

RECOMMENDATIONS ON FUTURE AGRICULTURAL POLICY ATKONGWAA Working Party was appointed by the Corporation in March 1950,consisting of Sir Charles Lockhart: A Member of the Corporation.Professor J. F. V. Phillips:  Chief Agricultural Adviser to the Corpora-tion and General Manager (Agriculture).Mr. G. F. Clay:  Agricultural Adviser to the Secretary of State for theColonies.Dr. H. H. Storey:   Deputy Director, East African Agricultural and forestry Research Organisation.Professor S. H. Frankel:   Professor of Colonial Economic Affairs,Nuffield College, Oxford.Mr. A. M. B. Hutt-: Member for Development, Tanganyika Government.Mr. J. C. Muir:  Member for Agriculture, Tanganyika Government.with the following terms of reference:-&quot; To recommend the long-term and short-term agricultural policies to be pursued by the Corporation in the Kongwa Region in the light of the results achieved to date and other evidence.&quot;2.   Attached to the Party as observers were:  The Working Party is much indebted to them for their assistance and advice and to the Tanganyika Government for having made them available.3. The Working Party were provided with a most comprehensive reportcompiled by Professor Phillips covering the soil, climatic and other natural features of the region, together with a detailed review of the clearing and agriculturaloperations undertaken to date. This minute study of every aspect of the problemproved invaluable. Professor Phillips&apos; report forms Appendix 1* to this report.Memoranda were also submitted by Dr. Bunting, Chief Scientific Officer, Mr. G. F.Clay and others, which are included as Appendix II.*4. The Working Party also took verbal evidence from the witnesses listed in Appendix III, arid had many informal discussions during their stay in Kongwa.5. After consideration of all the information and advice available to them,the Working Party were left in no doubt that large-scale agriculture on the linesso far practised should be discontinued; but that the attempt to establish a viablepattern of arable agriculture should not be abandoned. The scale on whichproduction should continue is a more open question. In their view annual croppingover the next three years should be restricted to approximately 12,000 acres; thebalance of the cleared area being utilised for feeding store cattle.The grounds for these conclusions and, assuming their acceptance by theCorporation, recommendations as to the action to be taken are included in thefollowing report.Mr. T. O. Pike: Provincial Commissioner, Central Province, Tanganyika.y* Not re-produced.
REPORT6. The most recent and the most striking evidence on the results achieved todate is that of the 1949-50 -harvest. Harvesting had not been completed while we were in Kongwa and the figures in the following table are, to some extent,estimated. The estimates of cost are based very largely on the costing of agricul-tural operations in the previous year. The figures can, however, be taken as beingsufficiently accurate for our purposes:  Averageyield per acre over	Acreage	Acreage	acreageCrop	planted	harvested	planted	Acres	Acres	Lb.Groundnuts...	9,500	8,700	1681Sunflower   ...	60,000	49,700	78Maize	3,700	3,700	810Sorghum    ...	1,100	1,100	970	74,300*	63,200t	Average			yield per			Estimatedacre over	Total	Estimated	cost ofacreage	estimated	value	productionharvested	yield	on farm	on farmLb.

It proved impossible to plant more than74,300 acres within the time available.f The difference between the acreage planted and the acreage harvested was due to: (a) 4,000 acres re-planted (sunflowers).(b) 7,000 acres not worth combining or lifting (sunflowers and groundnuts).t Kernels.7. It will be seen that in round figures and without any allowance for over-heads off the farm, it cost  600,000 to produce crops to the value on the farmof  100,000, but that 85 per cent, of the loss is due to the failure of the sunflowercrop, which was planted on 60,000 acres out of a total of 74,300.8. It is important to note that while the 1949-50 season was not as favourableclimatically as Kongwa can experience in a very good year, it must be regarded,broadly speaking, as having been as good as there is any reason to expect on theaverage.9. The questions with which we found ourselves confronted in the light ofthe evidence given to us were: -(a) is there any&apos;reasonable expectation that the causes of failure in 1949-50can be overcome and an economic farming system established, given theassumption that these causes can be broadly summarised as being anattempt to deal with too large an acreage for the numbers of staff and quantity of equipment available farm units of unmanageable size European staff lacking adequate experience equipment deficient in quantity and not in all cases yet well adapted to its task operation by African staff of insufficient training and with insufficientsupervision; or(b) whether, given the highest efficiency in farming practices which thereis any reasonable prospect of attaining, would it still be impossible toproduce economic yields of any crops on a sufficient scale in view ofthe marginal nature of the area.10. We cannot give an answer to these questions in the light of experience to date or the evidence presented to us, although on the second point there is evidence to show that the low annual rainfall and its erratic nature, combined withthe limited range of crops for which the area is likely to be suitable, makes large-scale arable agriculture at Kongwa a difficult venture. The point at issue is whetheror not these difficulties are insurmountable.11. If consideration were confined to the bare facts set out in paragraphs to 8 it would be difficult to escape the conclusion that the production of ground-nuts at Kongwa will never be successful on the large scale. We were, however,informed in evidence that under the controlled and more easily operated conditions
associated with production on an experimental as opposed to field-scale basis,satisfactory yields of both groundnuts and sorghum can be achieved. As a resultof experiments conducted under these conditions over the past three seasons, anaverage yield of 900 to 1,000 lb. of groundnut kernels per acre is reported by theChief Scientific Officer as possible in normal years. - Moreover, the experimental work being carried out oh implements and methods of cultivation couldundoubtedly result, in due course, in much higher standards of efficiency in thefield, to which the continued training of the European and African staff will contribute.12. To obtain maximum yields of groundnuts, as is the case with all crops,two major factors must be satisfied:  (a) Timeliness of all the agricultural operations concerned in the productionof the crop.(b) The establishment of the optimum plant population per acre.Under the severe climatic conditions prevailing at Kongwa, there is a very limited critical period of about 40 days after the break of the rains in which tocarry out the vital operations of:  (i) pre-planting cultivation and the establishment of a weed-free seed-bed;(ii) planting under conditions optimum for satisfactory germination;  and(iii) establishment of the crop and the subsequent weed control in the earlylife of the plants.Whether or not these operations can be carried out in time determines in large measure the ultimate yield; assuming, of course, the necessary minimum rainfall.13. Timeliness of operations depends upon an adequate force of labour and machinery with which to carry out the various operations at the correct time andan intimate knowledge of the land on his farm by the farmer in order to deployhis labour and machinery to the best advantage.14- The establishment of the optimum plant population per acre depends upon timeliness of planting, quality of seed in terms of viability, and the ability to supply the gaps inevitable in the initial stand under the chancy rainfall conditionswhich obtain at Kongwa. It has, for instance, been established that the optimumplant population for groundnuts is 50,000 plants per acre, but sample countscarried out on the units showed that only 18,000 plants per acre had been estab-lished under large-scale farming. It would be unreasonable to assume that these results cannot be improved upon.15. Successful farming is largely the outcome of accumulated experience,practical and experimental, and until this experience has been built up at Kongwait may be necessary in the initial years to provide for a higher density of Europeanstaffing and a greater complement of implements than will ultimately be necessaryonce sound and experienced farming practice and management have been developed, and there has been insufficient time to establish any balanced systemof farming at Kongwa. Consequently, much of the available costing data, notwith-standing its careful preparation, necessarily throws insufficient light on the probablecosts of farming in an established farm economy in this region.. 16. Our consideration of all the evidence presented to us in relation to this aspect of the problem has led us to conclude:  (a) That the Corporation would be ill-advised to proceed in 1950-51 with large-scale agriculture at Kongwa on the lines adopted in 1949-50.(b) That the attempt to establish a pattern of arable agriculture suitable tothe cleared area (which has been created at a great cost and may be a potential asset of importance) should not be abandoned without furtherexperiments on a field scale; the total scale being limited to approxi-mately 24,000 acres, with arable cultivation of 12,000 acres annually.We submitted an immediate interim report to the Corporation to this effect.17. The suggestions which follow regarding farming organisation, croppingprogrammes and agricultural methods are not intended to be applied as bindinginstructions which farm managers are necessarily constrained to follow.
Farming Organisation18. We regard the question of responsibility for direction and managementas absolutely fundamental. The organisation must be much smaller, much more flexible, free from the burden of preconceived objectives and targets, free from allextraneous costs not warranted by the enterprise on economic grounds, free fromundue or premature publicity, and given ample time to foster gradually the growth of viable economic units in a form suited to the exceptionally difficult circumstancesof the type of region in which they are being asked to operate. It must be clearly understood that the farm units proposed are being established precisely in orderto discover by practice whether really viable farm enterprises in the widest sense of the word can be permanently established in the region.19. The suggestion has been made that the sense of individual responsibilitycould be encouraged and greater flexibility in management and policy obtained by creating a local company, Kongwa Estates Limited. The advantages to beexpected from such an arrangement are set out in an addendum to this Reportby Professor Frankel. We appreciate these advantages, but the majority feel thatthere are difficulties in the way of its adoption during the experimental phase.20. Our detailed recommendations as to the organisation of the area are asfollows:  (a) That it should be organised in three farms operated, independently with full responsibility on the farm manager in charge of each, but that for reasons of economy the farm buildings for each farm should be allocated frombuildings available on the present No. 2 Unit.(b) The cultivable area of these farms, allowing for three years&apos; resting grassleys and three years&apos; cultivation, should be 12,000, 6,000 and 3,000 acresrespectively, with 6,000, 3,000 and 1,500 acres under annual cropping.(c) That an additional farm of from 1,000 to 1,500 acres of cultivation shouldbe placed under a manager whose operations should be directed and controlled by the Scientific Department and the Operational ResearchUnit; soil types for this farm being approximated as far as possible tothose of the smallest farm in the cultivated area.(d) That the farm managers of the farms recommended under (a) should beresponsible direct to the general manager (Central Regions) and that an^ area manager or an area staff is not necessary.(e) That for the machinery and implement repairs not carried out by the farmstaff, a scheme should be drawn up whereby the central workshopmakes a charge at normal commercial rates for each repair, on a jobbasis.(/) That agricultural and scientific advisory services should be provided by theCorporation.(g) That the simplest possible system of accounts and statistical returns on the farms should be adopted and every effort made to reduce paper work by the farm managers.21. Our recommendations as to the size of the farms are prompted to someextent by the essential need to establish the optimum unit for which one managercan be expected to be responsible for ensuring farming efficiency. When this hasbeen demonstrated on a farming unit which is economically self-supporting, thensuch farms could be repeated over a further proportion, though probably never thewhole, of the cleared area.In any event, the experience gained will provide a valuable guide for theorganisation of the other regions which the Corporation is developing. We considerthat the 30,000 acre unit, or any acreage of this order as a farming unit, does not permit of a properly integrated arable farm economy and its re-establishment shouldnot be aimed at, although we see no objection to a purely administrative area ofthis size or even larger.22. The suggestion that a farm of 1,000 to 1,500 acres should be. under thedirection and control of the Scientific Department and the Operational ResearchUnit is intended to assist in demonstrating whether or not the results obtained bythese departments on the smaller scale can be achieved on a farming unit whichcould be expected to succeed economically.
Planting Programme23.   Our suggestions on the planting programme are:(a) That on the red soils planting for the first year should be divided more orless equally between groundnuts and sorghum (including some foddersorghum) with maize on the valley soils.(b) That sunflower and safflower should not be planted except on an experi-mental basis, and if planted at all should be confined to the Scientific/Operational Research Unit farm.(c) That in the light of present knowledge of cropping possibilities on thembugas, field scale planting there should be restricted to maize withsome acreage of sorghum.The main production of the farms would thus be groundnuts and sorghum onthe red soils.Methods of Agriculture24.   Our recommendations regarding agricultural methods are:(a) That on the three farms (but not the Scientific /Operational Research Unitfarm) hand labour for groundnuts should, for the time being, be substi-tuted for machinery for cultivation subsequent to planting and forharvesting subsequent to digging, and that hand labour should also beused for supplying gaps in planting. One mechanical inter-row cultiva-tion and the use of mechanical threshing where the crop is large enoughto justify it could be included.(b) The sorghum crop should be fully mechanised, with the possibility of somehand-weeding where necessary.(c) The use of fertilisers on groundnuts in 1950-51 should be on a field trialscale only; sorghum and maize being fertilised over the greater part ofthe area.(d) The cropping should be organised on a strip cropping basis with alternatingstrips of cultivation and grass leys as far as possible.(e) In view of the results obtained from cultivating on the ridge as an important factor in soil and water conservation, this method of cultivation shouldbe employed wherever possible.Livestock25. Our recommendations as to the part to be played by livestock in theagricultural organisation as such are that the resting leys and also the permanentgrass on the pallid soils within the farm boundaries should be utilised to themaximum extent and that the control of stock within these boundaries and subjectto adequate advice should be the function of the farm managers. The density ofstocking which would enable the grass available to be fully utilised is at presentunknown and this knowledge should be gained by experience.Scientific Research26. We regard our farming proposals as being in themselves an experimentand consider it essential that, if embarked upon, the work should continue over aperiod of at least three years; indeed, purely from an agricultural standpoint, at leastdouble this period would be advisable. It is, of course, desirable that this experi-mental farming on a field scale should be supported by the Scientific department and the Operational Research Unit who should maintain their research and experimental work on crop variety trials and other agronomic work, fertiliser trialsand the continued testing out of equipment and farming technique. We appreciate that the field which they can cover is necessarily restricted by staff and finance.With this reservation we make the following suggestions as to investigations towhich special importance should be attached:  (a) Fundamental studies on the soil physical side, including soil and water rela-tions and particularly the retention of water in the soil under differenttreatments; and on soil structure and the possibilities of counteractingsoil compaction. We understand that E.A.A.F.R.O. might be preparedto collaborate in this work.(b) Physiological-ecological studies on crop plants and grasses, with particular reference to the range of root systems.
(c) A closer study of rainfall, humidity and evaporation.(d) Soil and moisture conservation methods, including the following treatmentson a typical hillside slope on red soils in which arrangements could bemade for measuring soil and water surface movement and moisturecontents of the soil at frequent intervals in time and space:  (i) Continuous cultivation with soil conserving banks and channels both on and off the contour.(ii) Strip cropping with alternate husbandry on the basis of three years&apos;cropping and three years&apos; leys.(iii) Permanent grass strip of varying width and varying intervals.(iv) Bare fallowing at intervals in the rotation.All reasonable combinations of these four methods should be used andarable cropping should be confined to sorghum and groundnuts, whichshould be planted on the ridge. It would be desirable also that treatmentof the grass leys should involve various systems, e.g., grazing versusmowing.(e) Studies of varieties of groundnuts, sorghum and maize in relation todrought resistance.(/) Extended small scale trials of possible alternative economic crops, par-ticularly cotton.(g) The study of Calidea and methods of controlling it.(h) Grassland research, veld surveys and field scale experiments in pasturemanagement.27. It is important that economic research in regard to the time and cost ofagricultural operations, utilisation of labour and relative costs of hand and machinelabour should be maintained.Utilisation of Total Land Available28. Having recommended that only 24,000 acres should be utilised for crop-ping and farm stock over the next three years, we propose that action, to be regardedfor. the present as exploratory, should be taken towards turning to some account the balance of the region over that period. Our proposals are based on the following considerations:  (a) If the farm units which we have recommended succeeed in establishing a sound pattern of arable farming, a further proportion of the clearedarea may be converted to arable and thus reduce the area of grazingnow available.(b) The Kongwa area was originally planned for the clearing of 450,000 acres.Only 94,000 are cleared, of which only 24,000 acres will be utilised overthe next three years under our recommendations, leaving 70,000 acreswhich will have reverted to a natural grass cover. There are thus large areas, running into many thousands of acres, which are available to theCorporation for further development. We are advised that much of this area might be suitable for organised ranching.(c) It is established beyond the need for further experiment that the Kongwaregion is a favourable one for local Zebu cattle. There is no tsetse fly;East Coast Fever is not a significant factor; epidemic diseases arereadily controlled; it is favourably situated for access to markets andthe Government Veterinary Headquarters and Research Station atMpwapwa are only 25 miles away and are connected by road and telephone.(d) The carrying capacity of the veld grazing is at present unknown, but it isunderstood that in the more favourable areas a capacity of one beastto 20 or 25 acres is at present possible. That on the cleared land shouldbe more. Experience shows that carrying capacity can be increased byveld management.(e) It is also known from experience elsewhere that slow but certain improve-ment in the quality of the stock carried can be effected by selection and skilled management. This process might be accelerated by the intro-duction of breeding stock of these improved Zebu types from elsewhere.
(/) A herd of some 2,500 head of local stock purchased as stores has already done well over a period beginning June 1949.29. Based on these considerations, we recommend the following line of actionover the next three years:  (a) The utilisation of the grazing on the cleared area of some 70,000 acres out-side the cultivated zone for the feeding of store cattle.(b) The continuance of the present experimental feeding of store cattle on theveld grazing areas in proximity to the perimeter of the cleared area forwhich water supplies are available already.(c) The preparation, after survey, of a working plan for ranching development,including stock breeding, over such part of the grazing areas outside thecultivated zone as would form a size sufficient to be worked economicallyas one unit. This plan to be subjected to expert examination and advice(including that of an experienced rancher) before adoption.(d) A complete survey of the areas available to the Corporation outside those already cleared with a view to an assessment of their potentialities forranching development.Both these surveys, i.e., (c) and (d) should include an investigation of marketoutlets.30. In order that the economics of these recommendations may be closelystudied, a commercial balance-sheet and profit and loss account should be producedeach year; an independent check being obtained of the valuation of the cattle inhand, thus providing an index to their progress.31. In connection with these recommendations, we would advise the earlyappointment of a stock man of proved experience in the ranching of this type of cattle. The responsibility for carrying them out would be that of the general manager (Central Regions).Long-Terra Policy32. The recommendations made in this report are all short term. It is notpossible, in our view, to consider the long-term agricultural future of the regionuntil the results of our proposals are known.33. We appreciate that the suspension of full-scale agriculture at Kongwa,at least for a time, will come as a severe disappointment to the agricultural field!staff. It is certainly no lack of enthusiasm and devotion on their part that hasled to such poor results. We are satisfied, however, that apart from other con-siderations, it would not be in their own best interests to risk another failure by attempting a further all-out effort in 1950-51.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS34.   A summary of our recommendations in bare outline is:  (a) Cultivation over the next three years to be restricted to four independentfarms with acreages under cultivation of (i) 6,000 acres, (ii) 3,000 acres,(iii) 1,500 acres, and (iv) 1,000 to 1,500 acres respectively; i.e., a totalcropping approximately 12,000 acres annually .(b) Cropping, except for small-scale experiments, to be restricted to ground-nuts and sorghum, with some maize on the valley soils.(c) Cattle bought locally for feeding and sale as fat stock to be grazed on theresting grass leys as part of the farming operations, and also to beranched on the land within the cleared area not allocated to farming and on the veld grazing in proximity to the perimeter of the clearedarea for which water is available.(d) A working plan and surveys to be made to enable a possible further development of ranching to be considered before the end of the three-year period.(e) Research and experiment in agriculture, implements and farming techniqueto be continued.
35. We are unable to predict the net financial effect of our proposals, but itis inherent in our recommendations that, in the situation with which the corporation is confronted, the risk of loss should be faced over the limited period proposed.C. R. LOCKHART.        J. F. V. PHILLIPS. G. F. CLAY.H. H. STOREY. S. H. FRANKEL. A. M. B. HUTT.J. C. MUIR.ISth August, 1950.ADDENDUMNote by Professor Frankel with reference to Paragraph 19 of the ReportThe suggestion for a new company, Kongwa Estates Limited, made in para-graph 19 is based on the desire to ensure that the nature of the organisationresponsible for the attempt to develop a balanced system of arable agriculture at kongwa should be different from that which was responsible for the operations at kongwa in the past.The setting up of a separate company is a well-known device for ensuring that responsibility is squarely placed on the shoulders of those who have to make theday-to-day decisions of policy which are so vital in economic enterprise and par-ticularly so in agriculture. It is a device which above all ensures that policy shallbe constantly related to the independent budget of the enterprise itself andhammered out in terms of its own Profit and Loss Accounts and within the frame-work of defined and initially limited financial resources.The shares of the new company would be held by a holding company (the Over-seas Food Corporation) and it is desirable that some of the shares in the new company should be taken up by other parties, private and public, and that thereshould be provision for international agencies to be permitted to do likewise.There is every reason to encourage African Governments to participate and, ifpossible, to enlist the support of American capital. In this way the independence of the company would be strengthened. It should be remembered that the results obtained will be of importance not only to many States in Africa but to all those interested in the opening up of under-developed regions of the world.Apart from these general considerations attention should be drawn to thefollowing advantages of this proposal:  (a) It would enable the creation in Tanganyika of a small financially inde-pendent, flexible organisation, designed specifically for the purpose inhand, free from all extraneous interference.(b) It would be able to adapt policy quickly to varying economic circumstances a most essential feature of all agricultural enterprise, which must takequick advantage of climatic and market changes.(c) The company would be managed, determine its expenditure and would dealwith its staff in accordance with local commercial circumstances. Itwould, at the same time, be small enough to establish a feeling ofintimacy and economic responsibility for a common purpose.(d) The capital structure of the company would be such as to provide sufficientresources to enable it to operate for a suitably long period so as to ensureits producing definite results either negative or positive. further capital would obviously only be raised, or loans made to the company,if it was sufficiently successful in the initial period of its operations.(e) The new company would in exchange for some of its shares acquire all such assets at Kongwa which in the discretion of its directors arerequired. Similarly, it would take over such staff and services as desired.(/) The company would also be responsible for carrying out in a manner inwhich it thinks best the proposals in the Working Party&apos;s Report andwould make use of such additional land as may be required to make itsranching activities economic.
(g) Arrangements would also be made for the new company to maintain allland cleared at Kongwa in a suitable condition the cost thereof in sofar as such land falls outside its requirements would have to be reimbursed to the company.The new company would be responsible for the scientific research outlined inthe Working Party&apos;s Report only in so far as that research could be economicallyintegrated into its operations, according to the opinion of its Directors. The balanceof the scientific research programme should be financed from other sources.The company would not be required to follow any plan of operations which inthe opinion of its directors would be prejudicial to its economic interests in relationto its long-term objectives. In particular, it would not be required to engage on any agricultural operations which may appear to its management to be premature.The company would have unfettered discretion in the recruitment of staff and inthe conduct of its affairs by directors elected by the shareholders.I would stress, in conclusion, that one of the fundamental purposes of these suggestions is to free the future management responsible for operations at Kongwafrom all costs which are in any way extraneous to its activities as a soundly basedeconomic enterprise. The main reason for choosing this company form of organi-sation is to create an economic unit which can make a clear-cut distinction betweenexpenses and policies which are, and those which are not, in keeping with thefundamental economic objectives to which the Working Party&apos;s Report has alreadydrawn attention. It is my view that an independent company of this nature is thebest means for attaining the objectives outlined in our Report and that the forma-tion of the company should take place as soon as. possible.S.
