1(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (50)   20U COPY NO.______QTH SEPTEMBER.  1Q5QCABINETCONTROL OF EXPORTS TO EASTERN EUROPE and communist ASIAMemorandum by J;he..Mijiisteijr of defence at present the security controls on East-West tradeoperated by the United Kingdom are based on international agree-ment with most of the other Powers of Western Europe.    in common with the latter, we divide exports into two categories:-(i)    goods absolutely prohibited to be exported to eastern europe (not including Finland and Yugoslavia)and China (International List l), and(ii)    goods subject to quantitative control of whichexports sufficient to meet reasonable peacefulneeds are allowed (International List 2).Goods in the first category are those which have a direct usein waging war:    those in the second category have, in general,a dual purpose both warlike and purely industrial,2. The basic issue now before Ministers is whether theUnited Kingdom should extend this system of controls.    In thefirst place,  it has been suggested that special steps shouldbe taken to restrict the supply through Eastern Europe and china to North Korea of goods which might have a directeffect on the Korean operations.    This proposal has been before ministers who have endorsed it generally.    It remains to workout the precise categories of goods which should come underthis definition and the best methods of control,3. In addition, the Cabinet have approved the principleof extending controls to prevent the export of goods which are .needed for this country&apos;s defence programme and our commitments to N.A.T.O.  and the Commonwealth.Z+, Thirdly, we have for some time been under pressure from the United States to control goods on a list known as&quot;American List IB&quot;.   This consists of items which have value for the growth of general industrial potential but are onlyindirectly associated with war waging capacity.    The Americans,however, argue that the growth of industrial cai ,city in russia is inextricably linked with the growth of military power.    It islikely that the Foreign Secretary will be strongly pressed onthis subject.5. The consequences of increasing our controls on the lines recommended by the Americans&apos; were considered last night at ameeting of Ministers mor;t immediately concerned, as a result of-1-

which it was decided(l)    that goods should not be exported to eastern europe or other countries if they are urgently required or are likely to be required for thedefence needs of the Commonwealth or of membersof K.A.T.O.;(2)    that a detailed scheme should be worked outafter consultation with the Law Officers aboutthe legal aspects of stopping supplies ofexisting contracts and agreements 1(3)    that the machine tools necessary for our defence programme now being produced by Graven Bros. Ltd.,should bs requisitioned by the Ministry ofSupply;that a list should be prepared of additionalgoods, of which the export to Eastern europe and China should be quantitatively restricted;(5)    to take administrative steps meanwhile to reducethe volume of these suppliesj(6)    to invite the Foreign Secretary to pursue withthe United States Administration the possibilityof finding some compromise solution in regard tothe extent of the prohibition of exports tothe Communistic countries.E.
