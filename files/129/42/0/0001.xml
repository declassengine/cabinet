this  document  is  the  property of his   britannic   majesty&apos;s   governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1950Copy No.3.2CABINETRESTRICTION OF EXPORTS TO EASTERN EUROPE AND china memorandum by the Minister of defence i regret having to reopen this question, which was considered by ministers as recently as 19th July, 1950 (GEN. 330/1st Meeting), but I am not fully satisfiedthat our security restrictions on trade with Eastern Europe and China are sufficiently comprehensive to prevent British exports being used in support of north Korean Forces in the current operations. I suggest, therefore, that weshould reconsider that particular aspect of the question in view of our own positionin relation to United Nations action in Korea.2. When, last month, on the basis of a memorandum (Gen. 330/1) by thePresident of the Board of Trade, we reviewed our general policy on East-west trade, we decided, notwithstanding American pressure for the extension of securitycontrols, to adhere to the broad principles we had adopted two years ago. these were to prevent the sale to the Communist bloc of any goods which might consti-tute a significant addition to war potential, but not to refuse to sell items of a normal commercial type, important in United Kingdom trade but relatively less important for defence security. The cardinal principle was to deny or restrict only those key strategic items which would contribute directly to the production ofarms and other war material. (The American policy is wider, since it aims also at limiting the basic industrial strength of the Soviet bloc, and provides for the denial of many ordinary industrial goods.)3. I have no intention of recommending any change in our general policy,which is reasonable in the circumstances of the &quot; cold war&quot; in view of our need to balance defence with trade considerations; but it does permit the export to china or Eastern Europe of a variety of goods which, although not strictly war potential, could be of direct and immediate use in sustaining military operations,and is not therefore suitable to the state of &quot; hot war &quot; now existing in Korea.It would be unfortunate, for instance, if it were to be shown that the communica-tion and transport systems in China and oriental Russia were being heavilyreinforced with British exports to assist in the maintenance of the North Koreanforces. It would also be embarrassing politically, since the American system of security controls, which they have urged us to adopt, covers most goods of thekind in question.4. There is already evidence that manufacturers and traders in this country are receiving enquiries, from China in particular, for abnormally large quantitiesof such items as steel wire rope, copper wire, wireless sets of army type, heavy duty-tyres, telephone equipment and steel rails. Traders have expressed uneasinessabout these orders and have sought advice from the appropriate GovernmentDepartments. Under existing policy, these goods can be exported without anylimit on security grounds.5. The interdepartmental Working Party who deal with the technical aspectsof security controls have investigated the possibility of restricting the export, to china and oriental Russia only, of abnormal quantities of industrial goods not39284SECRETCP.

already controlled on security grounds, but likely to be of use in the Koreanconflict. They have prepared a list of these goods, which is attached as an appendix.  Most of them are already controlled by the United States.6. The Working Party point out that restricting the export of these goods to china and oriental Russia only would not achieve the objective of preventing them from reaching Northern Korea. This could only be done by extending control to all Communist countries. Orders refused to China and oriental Russia mightlater be resubmitted via countries in Eastern Europe by whom they could be freely obtained and passed on to Asian destinations. Alternatively, the ordersmight go to other Western European countries, who impose no restrictions on thesupply of these goods, either to China or Eastern Europe.7. The Working Party therefore express the view that the only sure methodof restricting sales to Communist Asia would be to include the items on List ii of the International Security Control Lists. This would enable exports to belimited as necessary to all Communist countries, not only by the United Kingdom,but also by most other Western European countries and by the United States and canada.8. It would, however, take some time to secure the agreement of othercountries to this course. Moreover, some of the items listed, which would be of definite use to the North Korean forces, e.g., barbed wire, ball and roller bearingsand radio transmitting and receiving sets, cannot be effectively controlled withoutexport licensing. This problem, therefore, requires further detailed examinationbefore definite proposals can be made.9. The Working Party go on to explain, however, that something could bedone at once to limit and delay British exports of these goods to Asian destinationswithout taking formal action to include the items on the International SecurityControl List II. They suggest that the Departments which are in close touchwith the traders in question should be allowed, as an interim measure, to use what-ever powers or influence they possess to refuse or discourage exports (to Asiandestinations) of a nature that suggests support to the forces of aggression. Wheregoods are already subject to export licensing on supply or other grounds, nodifficulty would arise, since appropriate weight could be given to the security requirements when deciding whether to grant a licence. In other cases manu-facturers or traders could be advised to reduce or refuse abnormally large ordersupon which they sought advice or which otherwise came to notice.10. This action would not involve the complete suspension of exports to china and oriental Russia of the goods in question. The Working Party suggestthat it would suffice to limit them to small and reasonable quantities at the dis-cretion of the officials normally dealing with the trade, in consultation with theWorking Party. Further, action should not be restricted rigidly to the items listed in the Appendix, although the list is believed to be reasonably comprehensive. the officials concerned should be permitted to apply the restrictions to any abnormalexport which is likely to be of assistance in supporting the North Korean Forces.11. The Working Party point out that while these arrangements would not prevent undesirable exports from the United Kingdom to Communist Asia, theywould go some way towards reducing them to reasonable dimensions. The factthat the Civil Departments are already receiving numerous requests for advice on how to deal with enquiries for goods from the Far East is an indication that therewould be a reasonable prospect of obtaining the co-operation of industry. Whenindividual firms are asked to refuse part or all of an order experience shows thatthey would be likely to ask for an assurance that at least other United kingdom firms in the same industry will be invited to refuse a similar order. This assurancecan only be given if Departments are authorised to circularise all firms concerned.Such circulars should be so drafted as to avoid any suggestion of discriminatorycontrols against any country other than North Korea.12. To ensure that the restrictions have the maximum effect, the working party suggests that other Western countries should be informed and invited to applysimilar measures.   They also suggest that it would be necessary to include Hong
Kong and Singapore among the destinations to which these measures should apply,on the grounds that- ;(a) the measures proposed are essentially for operation at the producing point,rather than the transit point, and(b) it would be impossible for the Colonies to apply effective control withoutincluding the items on an Export Control List.Orders from Hong Kong and Singapore would not be rejected, however, without prior reference to the Colonial Office who would be at) liberty to consult the colonial governments concerned. It is recommended that the Hong Kong and SingaporeGovernments should also be asked to consider whether to the extent to which itmay be necessary for the purpose, they would be prepared to take corresponding action for items originating in those Colonies.13. In my view we should immediately take the action recommended by theWorking Party in paragraphs 9 and 10 in order to restrict to reasonable quantitiesthe import into China and oriental Russia of any goods likely to be of direct usein assisting the North Korean forces. I feel that by taking emergency action onthese lines we are less likely to meet with American objection to the continuanceof our general policy. The action would not be inconsistent with that policy.When we informed the Americans of our objections to their wider system of controls,we stated that:  -&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise the necessity for giving the fullestweight to security considerations. Our existing policy is flexible; and when-ever a change in the international situation gives added weight to securityconsiderations, we do not and will not hesitate to take the necessary action to prohibit exports. The recent decision in respect of petroleum products is acase in point.&quot;14. At the same time, I think we should move as quickly as possible towardsthe more effective method of control described in paragraph 7, i.e., the inclusion ofall such items on the International Control Lists and the restriction of their supply to all Communistic countries. This could be a temporary measure for the duration of the war in Korea. I realise, however, that this would present many problems and would be likely to involve considerable delay while agreement was reached with other participating countries. The Working Party is, therefore, examining the implications of such a step.15.   I therefore invite my colleagues to agree to (a) the immediate adoption of the emergency measures outlined in paragraphs9 to 12 above, and(b) to invite the Security Export Controls Working Party to furnish a report assoon as possible on the possibility of applying the more comprehensivemeasures outlined in paragraph 7.E.
