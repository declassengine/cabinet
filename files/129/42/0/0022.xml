COPY NO. ^ !*&quot;6TH OCTOBER, 1950CABINETNEW YORK MEETINGSTRIPARTITE DISCUSSIONS ON GERMAN PROBLEMSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe object of our discussions in New York on German problemswas to lay the basis for a further development in the relations between theOccupation Powers and the German Federal Republic, such as would enableGermany to assume new responsibilities appropriate to her position inEurope while safeguarding the security of the Allies and the maintenanceof the occupation.     The necessity for steady progress in this directionhad been foreseen at the tripartite meeting in London last May, when the .Foreign Ministers of the three Occupation Powers set up a study .group toundertake the necessary preparatory work to enable the existing occupation statute to be reviewed, as provided in the Statute itself, between the end ofSeptember, 1950, and the end of March, 1951, and to make recommendations for eliminating the major inconveniences arising from the state of war.It was of course understood that the supreme authority of the Allies inGermany must be upheld pending the reunification of the country, and thatany measures that might be regarded as constituting a separate peace with western Germany must be avoided.2. Since May new urgency had been lent to the study group&apos;s work bydevelopments in the international situation.     The Communist aggression in korea came as a shock to German opinion, which was quick to perceive the parallel with Germany&apos;s case and demanded both reassurance as to theAllies1 own plans for the defence of the Federal Republic and Berlin and guidance as to the role which the German authorities and the German people should play.     Communist propaganda from the Soviet zone played constantlyupon German fears and hesitations and suggested that the elections to beheld in Eastern Germany this October would mark a further stage in the consolidation of Communist power.     Meanwhile German appetites had beenwhetted by the prospect of further advance towards equality of status heldout by the Schuman Plan and the Federal Republic&apos;s entry into the Councilof Europe as an associate member.     Finally on the eve of our departure for new York Mr. Acheson informed M. Schuman and myself of the UnitedStates Governments intention to propose the establishment of an integrateddefence force in Western Europe in which, not only American divisions, butalso German units should participate.3. Against this general background the three Foreign Ministers had little difficulty in agreeing when we met in New York that early and decisivesteps were called for if German morale were to be restored and theassociation of Germany with the free nations of the West made as firm and close as Allied interests clearly seemed to dictate.     We were confirmed inthis view by our three High Commissioners in Germany who came to New

York to assist us in our discussions and who warned us in a report whichthey prepared for us there that, with German opinion in its present stateof disillusionment, the ground would require careful preparation if the participation of Germany in Western defence were to receiveHhenecessary degree of popular support.4. It was with these considerations in mind that we approached therecommendations made to us in the study group&apos;s report and reached thedecisions outlined in our final communique on Germany (copy annexed)and discussed in greater detail below.5. In the political field we were able to agree that steps should betaken, as soon as constitutional procedures permitted, to put an end tothe state of war in the domestic legislation of the Allied countries and ofGermany.     This is in itself a step of no great significance, since, in theinternational sense, the war between the Allies and Germany must beregarded as having ended with the unconditional surrender, but it is onewhich has psychological value for German opinion.6. We also reached agreement upon a formula defining the status of the German Federal Government, under which we recognise thatGovernment as the &quot;only German Government legitimately constitutedwhich can speak for Germany and represent the German people in inter-national affairs&quot; and as being in consequence the only Governmententitled to assume the rights and obligations of the former German Reichpending a final settlement with a united Germany.     On the basis of this formula-we approved procedures for enabling the Federal Government to succeed to the treaty obligations of the Reich and for working out a pro-visional plan for the settlement, pending Germany&apos;s reunification andhaving due regard to the Federal Republic&apos;s capacity to pay, of allfinancial claims against Germany arising out of pre-war external public and private debts of all types.and out of post-war economic assistance.In this latter connection I found it necessary to avail myself of theauthority given to me by my colleagues (CM.(50) 56th Conclusions,Minute 7) to agree that claims relating to war damage to United Nationsproperty in Germany should be excluded from the settlement plan andthat the regulation of expenditure on external occupation costs should be deferred until a general peace settlement.?. In addition we authorised the three High Commissioners to putinto force, in consultation with the German authorities, agreed relaxationsin the present occupation controls and to embody the changes in a documentamending the present Occupation Statute.     Before these changes come intoeffect the German Federal Government is to be required to give, firstly, ageneral undertaking of responsibility for the pre-war German externaldebt and in respect of post-war economic assistance to the western zones, and of co-operation in the working out and implementation of asettlement plan for claims and, secondly, an assurance that they will-operate in the equitable apportionment of materials in short supply orneeded for the common defence.8. The foremost of the alleviations proposed is in the field offoreign affairs, where the Germans are to be allowed to establish aForeign Ministry and to enter into diplomatic relations with foreigncountries in all suitable cases.     On the insistence of the French and united States Governments, which urged that such a step would be premature-ture, they will not be permitted at the present stage to appoint Ambassadorsto the capitals of the three Occupation Powers in view of the latter&apos;special position in Germany.     In internal affairs and particularly in

economic matters the Allies&apos; present powers of intervention and control will be substantially curtailed so that, in practice, they will be littleused except insofar as may be necessary to carry out the essential needs and purposes of the occupation.     The present procedure for prior review by the Allied High Commission of all German legislation before it canenter into force will be abolished and replaced by a simple right of repeal in grave and exceptional cases.     In addition, relaxations will be made in afurther series of controls, chiefly those relating to the accomplishment of specific Allied programmes in Germany (such as decartelisation, deconcen-tration, the care of displaced persons and the admission of refugees) assoon as the German authorities have given specified assurances or enactedspecified measures considered by the Occupation Powers to be necessary before they can relinquish their own responsibilities in these fields.9. The three Foreign Ministers also gave instructions for the earlyreview and revision of the Agreement on Prohibited and Limited industries in order to remove restrictions which are found unduly burdensome in administration or no longer justified on security grounds or likely toimpede the common defence effort.     Meanwhile it was decided as an interim measure to authorise the Allied High Commission forthwith,firstly, to permit German steel production to rise so that steel exportedor otherwise devoted to the defence effort of the West will not reduce theamount available for German consumption and, secondly, to remove all restrictions on the size, speed, and number of commercial cargo shipsbuilt in Germany for export.     The United States Secretary of State pressed strongly for these immediate concessions and, in the absence of Frenchsupport and bearing in mind the Cabinet&apos;s discussion of these matters before my departure (CM.(50) 56th Conclusions, Minute 6), I thought itwell in the circumstances to agree to them.10. The discussions in New York on the crucial question of german participation in the common defence of Europe are described in a separate paper (CP.(50) 223).    As there recorded, no final decision was reached onthis matter.     Meanwhile, however, certain decisions were taken which areof great importance to the security of Germany and an integral part of thenew phase in relations with the Federal Republic which it was our aim to inaugurate.     The three Ministers decided to announce in their finalcommunique that they would treat any attack against the German federal republic or Berlin from any quarter as an attack upon themselves.     this statement was of course designed both to restore confidence in western germany and Western Berlin and also to serve as a clear warning to theRussians and the East Germans against any ill-considered adventures,particularly the use of the East German military police for aggressivepurposes.     The Ministers also announced the intention of their Govern-ments to strengthen their forces both in the Federal Republic and Berlin.Furthermore, they announced their resolve to help Berlin to maintain its freedom, by economic as well as military means.     In an agreed document which has not been published, they recorded their decision to take certainnecessary measures to this end, including the building up of Berlin&apos;s stocksof fuel and non-perishable food to one year&apos;s supply and the preparation of plans for counter-measures against any renewed Soviet interference withBerlin transport.     This unpublished document also recorded the decisionof the three Powers to hold the Soviet Union responsible for any attack uponBerlin or Western Germany so long as the Russians remained in occupationof the Eastern Zone, and, in the event of an armed attack from whateversource, to defend Berlin by force, to bring the relevant provisions of theNorth Atlantic Treaty into effect and to present the issue to the united nations.

11. As announced in the communique, agreement was also reachedupon a plan for the formation of a German mobile police force for internal security purposes, with an initial strength of 30,000 men, equipped withlight arms, organised on a Land basis but subject to a measure of central control and with a uniform system of recruitment, training and equipment.I should have preferred an outright Federal force, but the Americans andFrench were unwilling to agree and the final plan represented a necessarycompromise with their concern for decentralisation.     But it makes pro-vision for full Federal control in an emergency, and will at least enablean immediate start to be made on remedying the present deficiencies inthe field of internal security in Germany, pending, and without prejudice to, later decisions on German participation in the general defence effort.Moreover, as recorded in the separate memorandum on defence questions(C.P.(50) 223), agreement was reached, with the assistance of the three defence Ministers, upon certain further means of employing German man-power and resources for the benefit of the common defence effort, assteps towards a fuller participation of Germany in the build up of thedefence of Europe.11. All these decisions, taken together, cover the whole field of ourrelations with the German Federal Republic.     They will be of great value in enabling the Western Allies to retain the initiative in the continuingstruggle for Germany and to lay a firm foundation for the difficult negotia-tions that will have to be undertaken with the Germans when a decision hasbeen reached among the Allies on German participation in the proposedintegrated European defence force.     But pending such a decision thepresent measures can only be regarded as provisional.     Once thedecision is taken a further review of the remaining Allied controls inGermany will have to be made.     The three Foreign Ministers accordingly decided that the tripartite study group should remain in being and that, ata time to be determined, it should undertake this further review in thelight of the circumstances and of the decisions made by the three Govern-ments at the time.     Meanwhile the study group is to address itself beforethe end of the year to certain immediate further tasks arising out of thedecisions already taken.     These are the agreed revision of the Prohibitedand Eimited Industries Agreement, the preparation of the agreed plan forthe settlement of claims, further study of the questions of foreign interestsin Germany and restitution preparatory to the relinquishment of the relevant reserved powers in these fields, and a review of the TripartiteControls Agreement and the Charter of the Allied High Commission.     Atthe same time the three High Commissioners, who returned to germany from New York as soon as the three Ministers had reached agreement,will continue to work, in consultation with the German authorities, on the implementation of the decisions already reached.E.B.Foreign Office, S.W.1,6TH OCTOBER, 1950.

COMMUNIQUE ON GERMANY(released in New York on 19th September, 1950)The Foreign Ministers have reviewed the situation on Germanyand allied relations with the Federal Republic, in the light of developments since their last meeting in London in May, 1950.     They have taken intoaccount in their examinations the views which have been expressed on recent occasions by the Government of the Federal Republic.     (1) they and their Governments share the desire of the German people for the unification of Germany on a basis which respects the fundamental liberties.Despite their efforts to achieve this end, it will obviously not be realisedso long as the Soviet Union continues to ignore proposals for democraticall German elections, and to stage controlled elections such as the oneto be held in the Soviet zone on 15th October.     (Z) Pending the unification of Germany, the three Governments consider the Government of the federal republic as the only German Government freely and legitimately constitutedand therefore entitled to speak for Germany as the representative of theGerman people in international affairs.     They reaffirm their desire, ofwhich they have already given many proofs, to integrate the federal republic into the community of free nations.     They are convinced that the overwhelming majority of the German people want to take part in buildingthe European community, and in strengthening its common civilisation.It appears to them that the time has now come to take a new step towardsthe attainment of these aims.     (3) In the spirit of the new relationship which they wish to establish with the Federal Republic, the three govern-ments have decided, as soon as action can be taken in all three countriesin accordance with their respective constitutional requirements, to take thenecessary steps in their domestic legislation to terminate the state of warwith Germany.     This action will not affect the rights and status of the three powers in Germany, which rest upon other bases.     It will, however,create a firmer foundation for the developing structure of peaceful and friendly relationships and will remove disabilities to which Germannationals are subject.     It is hoped that other nations will find it possibleto take similar action in accordance with their own constitutionalpractices.     (4) The three Ministers have given serious consideration tothe problem of the security of the Federal Republic in both its externaland its internal aspects.     They recognise the fact that outright militaryunits have been created in the Soviet zone of occupation and this facttogether with recent events in Germany and elsewhere have given rise to a situation of great concern.     The allied governments consider that their forces in Germany have in addition to their occupation duties also theimportant role of acting as security forces for the protection and defenceof the free world, including the German Federal Republic and the Westernsector of Berlin.     To make this protection more effective the allied govern-ments will increase and reinforce their forces in Germany.     (5) They willtreat any attack against the Federal Republic or Berlin from any quarteras an attack upon themselves.     (6) The Ministers are fully agreed that therecreation of a German national army would not serve the best interests ofGermany or Europe.     They also believe that this is the view of the greatmajority of the German people.     The Ministers have taken note, however,of sentiments recently expressed in Germany and elsewhere in favour ofGerman participation in an integrated force for the defence of Europeanfreedom.     The questions raised by the problem of the participation of theGerman Federal Republic in the common defence of Europe are at presentthe subject of study and exchange of view.     (7) As regards internal security, the Foreign Ministers recognise the necessity for ensuring thatthe German authorities are enabled effectively to deal with possiblesubversive activities.     To this end the Foreign Ministers have agreed to

permit the establishment of mobile police formations organised on a Landbasis but with provisions which would enable the Federal Government tohave adequate powers to make effective use of all or part of this force inorder fully to meet the exigencies of the present situation.     The high commission and the Allied forces in Germany will render such assistance as may be feasible in the rapid establishment of this force.     (8) The newphase in the relations between the Allies and the Federal Republic willbe marked by major extension of the authority of the Federal Governmentto make this possible, the occupying Powers are prepared to amend theOccupation Statute while maintaining the legal basis of the occupation, andthe Federal Republic will be expected to undertake certain commitments andother actions consonant with its new responsibilities.     (9) In the field offoreign affairs, the Federal Government will be authorised to establish aMinistry of Foreign Affairs and to enter into diplomatic relations withforeign countries in all suitable cases.     (10) In other fields, and particu-lairly     in relation to internal economic matters, far-reaching reductionswill be made in existing controls, and the present system of review ofGerman legislation will be modified.     In certain cases, the Allied powers will cease as soon as the Federal Government has given undertakings ortaken suitable action.     The High Commission will promptly begin discussions with the Federal Government to work out the necessary agreements for suchundertakings.     (11) The Foreign Ministers have also agreed that a reviewof the Prohibited and Limited Industries Agreement shall be undertaken inthe light of the developing relationship with the Federal Republic.    Pendingthis review the High Commission has been instructed to remove forthwithall restrictions on the size, speed and number of commercial cargo shipsbuilt for export and to allow steel to be produced outside the presentlimitation where this will facilitate the defence effort of the West.(12) The three Governments pay tribute to the continued steadfastness ofthe people of Berlin in the valiant struggle of the city to preserve its freedom.     They will continue to oppose aggression in any form againstthe people of the city, and are taking steps to strengthen Allied forces there.     In view of the heavy price Berlin has had to pay to defend its freedom, the Governments will continue their efforts to alleviate its economic situation.     They have directed the High Commission to review the statement of principles governing relationship between the AlliedKommandatura and Berlin, and to liberalise Allied controls in the city tothe maximum extent practicable.     These decisions mark an importantstage in the normalisations of the relations and should contribute towardsthe creation of an atmosphere of mutual confidence and understanding.They represent a major advance towards the progressive return of Germanyto partnership in Western Europe and the consolidation of the westernnations in their efforts to establish a firm basis for the future peace ofEurope and the world.
