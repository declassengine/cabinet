&apos; &apos;     164S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y &apos;5 GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 244 COPY NO.    ^27TH OCTOBER, 1950CABINETTEMPORARY LEASEHOLD LEGISLATION:APPLICATION TO OFFICESMemorandum by the Lord President of the Counciland the Lord ChancellorIntroductionOur colleagues have already considered, on 20th October(CM.(50) 66th Conclusions, Minute 3), our proposals for legislationgiving a right of renewal of their tenancies for a maximum of one year to tenants of shop premises (C.P.(50) 232).     The view was then expressed that, on the introduction of the Bill to Parliament, there would be pressure to extend this protection to offices, and that a provision covering officesshould be drafted for consideration at a later stage.     We have hadenquiries made into the implications of such an extension, which revealconsiderable difficulties, which we think it desirable to set out for theconsideration of our colleagues.     We are sorry to be raising this issueagain and at short notice;   but the Government will have to be ready toindicate its intentions in some detail in the Debate on the Address.Difficulty of limiting scope of protection2. The main difficulty that has been pointed out is that once we go beyond shops it will be almost impossible to defend any line we choose todraw.3. The Leasehold Committee in their Interim Report&quot; were satisfiedthat there was no case for discriminating between one kind of business andanother, and recommended protection for &quot;all premises used for business,trade, manufacturing, or professional purposes, whether profit-making ornon-profit-making&quot;   (Summary, page 29, paragraph 3)-.     In the Final Report,though the majority of the Committee confirmed this recommendation, therewas a deep cleavage on the question whether tenants engaged in non-profit-making activities (e. g. charities, political organisations and clubs) shouldbe. protected.4. The Conservative Party Conference at Blackpool last monthadopted a resolution which spoke of protection for business premiseswithout qualification.5. B After the publication of the Committee&apos;s Final Report the LordChancellor saw a deputation of the Housing and Town Planning Group ofthe Labour Party.     They favoured the early introduction of legislationcovering all types of business tenancies.     When the Lord Chancellorindicated to them that it was probable that the interim legislation would be applicable to shops but not to industrial premises, the deputation pressed

particularly the claims of small industrial premises. The Lord Chancellorsubsequently had some correspondence with Mr. C,L, Hale, M,P., a memberof the Leasehold Committee, who urged the inclusion of offices.6. There is, therefcre, some evidence that on both sides of theHouse a measure which covered business premises as a whole would be welcome. Except for Mr. Hale, no one has suggested that there shouldbe any special treatment for offices,7. The Tenancy of Shops (Scotland) Act, 1949, is a precedent fwrconfining interim legislation to shops.     Further, it may fairly be saidthat it is in the case of shops that there is the clearest need on the partof the tenant to continue his business in a particular set of premises where he is known.     If we include all offices (and we are advised it would not bepossible to draw a distinction between different kinds of offices), we shallbe recognising the existence of a general need for such immediate protec-tion as would justify their inclusion in the temporary Bill.     Shortage of accommodation, for example, affects not merely office and shop tenants,but also doctors, dentists, trade union and trade organisations, societies and clubs, and industrial tenants.     In particular, the desirability of protecting industrial tenants - and sc helping to freeze existing patterns ofindustrial production - may obviously raise a grave issue.     Very detailed consideration will be needed before reaching a decision on the scope ofpermanent protection, and a wide approach to the temporary legislation might prejudice the position in advance.Difficulties of definition8. Policy considerations apart, the practical difficulties n defining offices are considerable.     If we adopt the alternative course of leaving the expression undefined, the courts will be faced with a good manyborderline cases (e..g, the headquarters nf a society, the place where an industrial designer carries on his profession).     If experience of pastattempts is any guide, there is no hope of evolving a satisfactory generaldefinition.     A third course would be to list the kinds of premises we wishto cover.     This seems to be the worst of the three, because it would involvea number of subsidiary problems of definition, &quot;/ould probably produce anincomplete list, and v/ould certainly give rise to lengthy debate in Parliament.9. A further problem r,i definition arises in the case of mixedpremises.     There is no way rf drawing the line between the tenant wholives over his office, whom we would want to protect, and the man who(more or less casually) uses one room in his house for what might be calledoffice purposes.     We should, we think, have to confine the protection topremises which were offices and nothing else.     This would be anomalousin view of the treatment we propose, and must propose, for shops.Conclusion10. On balance, while there is no doubt real hardship among someoffice tenants, we doubt whether there are any grounds for treating officesdifferently fr^m any other class of non-retail business premises.     In viewof the practical difficulties, and of the danger of prejudicing the permanent legislation as a result of any attempt to protect business premises generallyunder the Bill, it might be well to limit the protection in this temporary Billto shops, and to leave the question of including offices for consideration whenthe permanent legislation is prepared.     We are given to understand that thiscourse would be acceptable to the President &quot;if &quot;the Board of Trade.H.M.J.27TH OCTOBER, 1950.
