HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y &apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.P.(50) 208 COPY NO. 12,15TH SEPTEMBER, 1950CABINETEAST AFRICAN GROUNDNUT SCHEMEREPORT OF THE KONGWA WORKING PARTYMemorandum by the Minister of food think that my colleagues will wish to be informed of the actionwhich I have authorised the Board of the Overseas Food Corporation to take on the agricultural future of Xongwa.2. The Corporation have now had two years1 experience of large scale agricultural operations at Kongwa.      About 40,000 acres of groundnutsand sunflowers were harvested in 1949, and this year 70,000 acres out ofthe cleared area of 90,000 acres were planted with sunflower, groundnuts,maize, and sorghum.   The 1949 harvest was a complete failure because ofthe drought which affected the whole of East Africa.    But since a droughtof this severity was not thought likely to be a recurrent hazard, the experienceof 1949 was not regarded as a reliable guide to future results.   This year,although climatic conditions were not as favourable as Kongwa can experience in a very good year, they are regarded as having been as good as can beexpected on average.   But again the harvest was a disappointment.3. The Board of the Corporation felt they ought, before embarking on a third season, to arrange for the experience so far gained to be examined in some detail and for future policy to be decided in the light of this examination.   They accordingly set up a Working Party under the chairmanship of Sir Charles Lockhart to make recommendations on the short-term and long-term agricultural future of Kongwa.    The members of the Working Party were as follows:-Professor J. F. V. Phillips   -   Chief Agricultural Adviser to theCorporation and General Manager(Agriculture)- Agricultural Adviser to the Secretaryof State for the Colonies- Deputy Director, East African Agri-cultural and Forestry research organisation- Professor of Colonial Affairs, NuffieldCollege, OxfordMr. G. F. ClayDr. H. H. Storey, F. R. S.Professor S. H.  Frankel

Mr, A.M. B. Hutt -   Member for Development,Tanganyika GovernmentMr. J.C. Muir -   Member for Agriculture, TanganyikaGovernment4. The Working Party submitted their recommendations to theBoard of the Corporation on 18th August.   Briefly their view is that,while the attempt to establish a viable pattern of arable agriculture forKongwa should not be abandoned, the Corporation would be ill-advised tocontinue large-scale agriculture on the lines so far practised.   They recommendthat for the next three years 24,000 acres should be set aside for four farms of varying sizes and cropping should be restricted to the cultivation of groundnutsand sorghum on approximately 12,000 acres each year.    The balance of thecleared land - 70,000 acres - should be used for grazing store cattle.   Theydo not feel that the long-term, agricultural future of the region can be con-sidered until the results of the three years1 experience on this limitedacreage are known.5. The Working Party have based their recommendations on a detailed   study of the experience and information available about conditions at Kongwa.   In spite of the unfortunate experience of the past two seasonsand the known climatic uncertainties of the region, the Working Party didnot feel that the evidence before them could be regarded as showingconclusively that large-scale arable agriculture at Kongwa could neversucceed.    They were informed that satisfactory yields of both groundnutsand sorghum had been achieved under the controlled and more easily operatedconditions of production on an experimental as opposed to field scale basis,and in these circumstances they did not feel able to recommend that the attempt to establish a pattern of agriculture suitable to the cleared area(which has been created at great cost and may be a potential asset ofimportance) should be abandoned without further experiments on a field scale.6. The Board of the Overseas Food Corporation have accepted inits main essentials the Report of the Working Party.   Disappointing thoughthe proposals are, the Board cannot but recognise that it would be folly topress on with large-scale agriculture for another season.    I, too, am convinced that the Working Party&apos;s recommendations are sound, and whenthe Corporation consulted me about their proposal to act on these recommendations in the forthcoming planting season, I authorised them to do so.7. The Corporation will be submitting later in the year a generalrecast of their proposals for the East African Groundnut Scheme.   I hopethen to have an opportunity of a full discussion with my colleagues.   but since the Working party  s proposals for Kongwa entail far-reaching changesin organisation and administration which must be carried out in time for thenext planting season it was necessary for the Board to settle the policy tobe pursued at Kongwa in advance of completing the general revision of their plans.    I, therefore, felt it right to give the Corporation authority to makethe necessary changes without- delay, in the knowledge that the implications of the Kongwa Working Party&apos;s recommendations would have to beconsidered in connection with the general review later in the year.

9si8, As a first step the Corporation propose to publish the Reportof the Kongwa Working Party both in this country and in East Africa on20th September, together with a short foreword indicating the Board&apos;acceptance of the recommendations.   I welcome this proposal.    TheReport will inevitably cause great disappointment, but I am convincedthat a frank disclosure of the considerations which have led up to thedecision to curtail the acreage under crops at Kongwa is the only right course.   Sir Eric Coates, the Chairman of the Corporation, will hold a press Conference on the 19th September so as to give every opportunityfor.the change of plans to be seen in perspective.M. W.MINISTRY OF FOOD , S. W. 1. ,15TH SEPTEMBER, 1950.
