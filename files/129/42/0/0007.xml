(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp,(50) 207COPY NO. 3 2&quot;14TH SEPTEMBER, 1950CABINET .LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE KOREAN CONFLICTMemorandum by the Attorney-general  am sorry to have to bring before my colleagues what, at first sight, appears a purely legal question, namely whether the presentconflict constitutes, either in our own law or in international law, awar, and if not, what its precise legal status is.     I do so, however,with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor since the situation is sounprecedented   that we are, to some extent, in the position of being able to make new law about it and the position we take up must havesignificant political and legal consequences.     The matter is made ofthe more immediate importance because of a question addressed to thePrime Minister for answer on 18th September about the activities ofthe Daily Worker&apos;s correspondent with the North Korean armies.     Itis in a sense a question of what words mean.     &quot;When I use a word,said Humpty Dumpty, it means just what I intended it to mean:   neithermore nor less.     But, said Alice, the question is whether you can makea word mean different things.     Not so, said Humpty Dumpty, thequestion is, which is to be the master that is all. &quot;2. In our own law a certificate by the Foreign Secretary is con-elusive, in any Court proceedings, on the question whether or not HisMajesty is at war.     But such a certificate could only be given by himafter due regard to the legal position and in any event his certificatewould not be binding in international law.     On the other hand, thequestions whether the law of treason applies, whether the Army is to beconsidered on active service, the application of the rules of war, theeffect of the Foreign Enlistment Act and so on are all governed by the precise legal status of the present conflict.3. I have annexed to this memorandum for the record, letterswhich have passed between myself and the Lord Chancellor in whichthe legal arguments are canvassed, I am afraid (so far as my ownletters are concerned) at great length.     Broadly summarised theposition is that both tiie Lord Chancellor and I agree that the law oftreason and other English laws apply to the present conflict as if itwere a war in the ordinary sense.     This seems to be a conclusionwhich should be made public on some suitable occasion, possibly in answer to Major Tufton Beamish&apos;s question.4. The Lord Chancellor further considers, on the whole, thatthe conflict is a war in the ordinary sense, both under our municipallaw and internationally.

5. President Truman and the Canadian Prime Minister have,however, both expressly stated that their countries are not involved inwar but are engaged in a &quot;police operation&quot; under the United Nations.In view of their declarations 1 have, although without much confidence,enunciated   the proposition that international law does now recognisea kind of twilight condition in which collective enforcement action taken under the aegis of the United Nations does not constitute a warin the old sense, which was the settlement by force of arms of a con-tention between individual States.     There is here no contention between individual States and North Korea;   the contention is between the united nations collectively and North Korea.6. All this is, however, frankly new law and we have to decide whether we want to create new law in this sense.     It is obviouslyimportant that in this matter we should agree if we can with theUnited States and the Commonwealth countries.     The Lord Chancellortherefore concurs in my suggestion that we should decide what in ourview is the correct position to take up and should then arrange for consultation at the highest possible level to see whether we can secure agreement.H.W.S.Law Courts, W.C.2,14TH SEPTEMBER, 1950.

24ANNEXCOPY OF LETTER FROM THE ATTORNEY-general to THE LORD CHANCELLORROYAL COURTS OF JUSTICE ,LONDON, W.C.2.h.th September, 1950.XXX .KOREA3  ETC.    THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONSAs you know, the Law Officers do not, as a rule, intrude their opinions unless asked for them.    Butin view of the approaching General Assembly of theUnite d     Nations as well as of the possibility that aBill providing for Emergency Powers may be presented tothe next Session of Parliament, I think I ought to consult with you on certain matters which seem to me important.The present situation in Korea is giving riseto an increasing number of legal questions of practical importance as, for instance, whether the Foreign Enlist-ment Act, applies, whether the present operations are within the scope of the oath taken by soldiers onattestation, whether they will constitute active serviceand, not least,  the difficult question as to theapplication of the law of treason.    But behind all thisis the fundamental question whether what is now takingplace in Korea constitutes war, either in internationallaw or for the purposes of our own municipal law.   Noris this a question which concerns the Government of theUnited Kingdom or those of the Commonwealth countriesalone.    It vitally affects the United States, as well as .other members of the United Nations.    I should have thought that the whole matter, along&apos; with the legality of the action taken by the Security Council, the legal position as to Formosa and related questions are most likely to be raised at the Assembly of the United Nations.Of course, from one point of view it does not much matter what the law is:    we are committed to a certain courseof action and we must pursue it without any unduly niceargument about the legal position.    But for the purposeof rallying world opinion it is I think important to showthat the steps we take are firmly based on the rule oflaw and for our own domestic purposes, as in the casesI have already mentioned, it is essential to know on whatview of the law we take our stand.    In these circumstances,it had seemed to me important that if possible there shouldprior to the Assembly be some consultation at a high level with the legal advisers of the United StatesGovernment and of the Commonwealth Governments.    The legal position is quite without precedent and.in order to avoiddivided and inconsistent counsels at the United Nationsit might be useful to ascertain beforehand what is thegeneral consensus of opinion amongst our friends.    I would,indeedj^have liked to have had an opportunity of discussinguLJie. \     the * uoil* matter with Mr. McGrath,  the United StatesAttorney-General but this being impracticable perhaps an exchange of views could be arranged in some other way so

2 5that, if and when these matters do come to be raised in theAssembly, a common opinion should be expressed, in the mostaut hor it at ive way pOs sib le.In the meantime it may be useful if I indicate my own view on the question whether there is not at present, an actual state of war involving this country.      There can, Ithink, be no doubt that a state of war exists between Northand South Korea,      Both satisfy the usual definition of astate as being peoples organised for lav/ under a Government.Southern Korea has received some degree of internationalrecognition:    it would be impossible I think to deny theattributes of Statehood, to Northern Korea.      &apos;.7ar is a contentions-tion between States through their armed forces and the eonclu-sion that Southern and. Northern Korea are at war seemsinescapable.V.&apos;hen Russia attacked Finla:..d in 1939, although, sheexpressly stated that she was not at war and was simply&quot;aiding the legitimate Government&quot;, the assembly of the Leaguefound otherwise.     When Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935 a reportapproved by the Council held that a state of war existed.      Itis true that the Sino-Japanese conflict starting in 1937 was never expressly stigmatised by the League of Nations as a warand that our own Foreign Office took up a temporising attitude as to the legal status of the dispute.      It is to be feared that this inglorious chapter in world history was due to the reluctance of members of the League formally to declare theexistence of a state of affairs which would-have put themmanifestly In breach of their own obligations under theCovenant.      On the other hand, the Assembly did say that japan had broken the Pact of Paris for the renunciation of war.      Iflav/ and not political expediency were the test, the Sino-Japanese dispute was,  I should have thought,  obviously a war.Indeed in the case of Korea the only alternative hypothesis toan actual state of war is that the North and South are engagedin a civil war which is a hypothesis which we expresslyrepudiate (Note (1)).      The real question is, therefore,v/hether we, along with the other countries who are supporting-Southern Korea, are accessory belligerents.It is at least clear that we are not at peace with northern Korea.      Our sea and air forces have, as I under-stand, already been deployed against her, and our land forcesv/ill shortly be engaged in battle.      I do not suppose that underthe law as understood prior to the Charter of the united nations there could have been much doubt that a state&apos; of warexisted between His Majesty and Northern Korea.      It is truethat there has been no formal declaration of war but for along time (cf^ The Teutonica: 1872 L. R.  P. C.  at p. 179) it hasbeen recognised&quot;That&quot; war may &quot;exist&quot;&apos;v7i&quot;without a declaration andin more recent times the practice of totalitarian States hasrarely included a declaration of war as a prelude to hostilities-ties.      On the other hand, if hostilities which would other-wise constitute a war exist a unilateral declaration that thereis no war might be of little legal effect.      Nelson might cry&quot;we are brothers we are friends and we conquer but to save&quot;but the Battle of the Baltic was none the less an operationof war.      Similarly the ipse dixit of President Truman(Note.(2))  or of ourselves that we are engaged in a policeoperation and do not consider ourselves at war may not beconclusive unless indeed it can be said that the Charter of theUnited Nations has- so far altered international law that thereis now a kind of twilight condition, between war and peace, inwhich although active-hostilities are taking place there is, asa matter of international lav/, no actual war between the Statesinvolved.

26On the whole I am inclined to think that currentinternational law as established by the Charter does envisagesituations in which force may be employed collectively against an aggressor and that such collective employment of force by orunder the aegis of the United Nations, whilst in many respectsproducing results indistinguishable from war,  does not consti-tute war within the meaning of international law.      Collectiveenforcement action by and on behalf of the organised community of nations, it may be said, is not war in the accepted sense,namely that of sovereign States pursuing their national policy or simply defending their own independence.      But the impliea-tions of this argument must not be carried too far.      &apos;.7h.at is happening in Korea may well form the pattern under which,following, for instance a Russian attack on Persia or Yugoslavia,a world conflict might arise:    could, it be said then that therewas no- v/ar?     Such a view would have many important conse-quences, amongst others that the laws of war would not applyand, possibly, that those rules of municipal lav/ which are based on the existence of a state of v/ar would not be available.Moreover, the present operations are not the result of any direction by the United Nations.      The Security Council refrained from action under Articles       and i.j-2, which would have given rise to obligations on the part of member Nations, and contenteditself with making recommendations under Article 39.      I say nothing here of the possibly questionable legality of theaction which the Security Council did take:    we have committedourselves, on the whole I think rightly and as in any event wewere bound to do, to the view that it was legal.None the less, as the present situation is withoutprecedent in international lav/ and we have in effect the law-making function of declaring what the lav/ is, it may be thatthe present is at once a proper and a useful opportunity ofdistinguishing between war as a private, and now illegal, con-tention between States seeking to settle their individualdifferences by force and collective action for restraining the aggressor and enforcing the law.-   &apos; Just as in the field of domestic law action which would, as between private citizensconstitute an illegal assault may, when taken by the State,constitute a legal use of force, so we must elevate collectiveaction on behalf of the United Nations to the dignity of a legalinstitution higher than war as traditionally waged between states in the past as a means for the solution of their quarrelsinter Be..     This may reasonably be thought to constitute some progress in international lav/:    individual v/ar is now outlawedand^all that States can do is to defend themselves if directlyattacked or to participate in collective police operations inassistance of a&quot;&quot; State held by the United Nations to be the victim of aggression.      There is,  on this vie//, no individual&quot;contention&quot; between His Majesty in the United Kingdom as suchand Northern Korea:    His Majesty is acting in his capacity asthe sovereign of a country belonging to the United Nations andimplementing the recommendation of that body.      The contentionor dispute is between the United Nations and the aggressor and &apos;the action taken by His majesty&apos;s forces is taken on HisMajesty&apos;s behalf qua Sovereign of a member of the UnitedNati ons.There are many fairly obvious difficulties in this argument which frankly involves new law.      Defensive Militaryalliances were not unknown in the old days and States coming to the assistance of those to whom they had. Treaty obligations and who had become involved in war, themselves became principalor accessory belligerents.      is the Charter of the united nations anything more than such a treaty writ large?      On the-whole I think it  is and that in conjunction with the- Pact of paris&apos;of 1928 it substitutes a form of collective enforcementaction for the maintenance of peace in the place of war as

between individual States.      At all events we should clear our minds about this and decide what the true position is.      Itmay, of course, be said that, for our own Courts, the matter would be settled by a certificate by the Secretary of Statecertifying whether or not a state of war existed (cf.Kuchenmeister 1 9^-6 1 A. E, R. L. 6^5).      But we should&apos;have toconsider -what advice we could give to the Secretary of State inthis connection and it may be that he would simply have tostate the facts and leave it to the Court to decide whetherthey constituted a war (ef. Kawasaki, etc.  v.  Bant ham SS Co.1939 2 K. B.  5*4-5).      I am inclined to think that this would bethe more proper course, especially in a criminal case.      but even so, we must resolve the matter for ourselves, so as toknow what, in our submission, the Courts conclusion ought to be.For important consequences follow.      One relates tothe application of thet rules of warfare.      It is not I thinkessential that,  in order that these rules should be applicable,a formal state of war must exist.      In the past it appears that,by tacit or express acceptance, the rules of war have been applied in civil wars, and the recent tendency, as illustrated by the Geneva Conventions of 1949 is to apply them to conflictsother than those which are international wars inthe strictsense of the term.      On the other hand, it may seem desirablethat we should safeguard the principle that no benefits canautomatically accrue to the aggressor from the unlawful use of force in the way that they did accrue to belligerents beforeinternational law had stipulated, as I think it now clearlydoes, that war is unlawful and, indeed, criminal (cf. the judgment of the Nuremberg Tribunal).      Thus it might be properfor us,  (and indeed for the United wations) to declare that although the present hostilities, constituting the collectiveenforcement of international law and of the Charter, cannot beconsidered war in the old and strict sense of the term, HisMajesty&apos;s Government are prepared and determined on the basisof reciprocity and for the duration of the conflict to apply inthese hostilities the accepted rules of warfare.      The purposeof the qualifying words underlined would be to reserve thepossibility of maintaining that after the cessation ofhostilities the aggressor should not be able to rely onadvantages which States have in the past secured from theexercise of belligerent rights such as those relating to the appropriation of property, requisitions, prize and so on.There is also the question whether those States which stand aside can rely on the complete rights and rules of neutralityas hitherto understood.      Certainly where the Security Councilacts under Articles 2+1 to 2+3 of the Charter (which it has not done in the present case) and imposes obligations on member states neutrality in the old sense can hardly exist.      Thesematters may be of little practical significance in relation toKorea but they would be of critical importance if the hostilities became extended.More immediately important  arc the implications ofthe present situation upon our municipal law.      Do those wholend aid and comfort to the northern Koreans commit treason?What is the position in regard to the Foreign Enlistment Actand the Army Act?     Do questions arise as to trading with theenemy?     V/hat is the position as to tae lav/ of prize?    - to mention only the most obvious matters.Take first the question of treason.      Is it to besaid that those British subjects who lend aid and comfort tothe North Koreans, who for instance .fight in the north korean Army, assist them by propaganda or otherwise are notguilty of treason because there is strictly no war?.    This hasbeen the assumption hitherto but I doubt its validity:    itwould be astonishing if such a proposition could be maintained

28in the fact of a conflict otherwise similar, so far as action by the Security Council is concerned&apos;, but on a larger scale and involving us more immediately.      The law of treason is,of courses much older than the inter-national law of war.      Thetie a son of &quot;levying war&quot; does not relate to war in the inter-national sense and can only be committed by acts - such asrebellions - done within the realm.      When internationalconflicts are contemplated, the law of treason seems to speak of the King&apos;s enemies, not of war,  and I do not think itinevitably follows that there cannot be one without the other.It is true that the King&apos;s enemies in this sense have usuallybeen, considered to be foreign States in actual hostility to him(Fost.   219;,    1 East P. C 77)-      But this does not seem to be essential:    foreigners who invaded this country though notwith the consent of their sovereign would be enemies (op.  cit)although no state of war would exist between the foreign Stateand His Majesty.      It is clear that no formal declaration ofwar is necessary (1 Hale P.C.  162).      It seems to me that if his Majesty&apos;3 forces are engaged in &quot;active fighting in North.Korea,  &quot;shooting to kill&quot; North Koreans as they have been instructed to do, and the North Koreans are using all themeans they can to destroy His Majesty&apos;s forces, it would beillusory to say that the North Koreans were not the King&apos;senemies.      It is true that the expression cannot apply torebels within the realm or to British subjects.      But nobodywould suggest that the North. Koreans were ifriends, and in this context l cannot believe that there is any half way house.My general view is that one must interpret the oldstatutes and common law on these matters in the light of thepurposes they were designed to serve and that where HisMajesty is in fact engaged in armed conflict with anotherpower the law of treason applies notwithstanding the fact that changes in the nomenclature adopted in international law may now describe such operations as exercises of collective security or police enforcement  rather than as war.If, however, this view is correct it has important implications - for instance in relation to Communist propagandahere - and I think it is essential that some clear declaration should be made to the effect that the lav/ of treason isoperative, so that the lieges are warned.      We must, if wefollow this- view, state clearly that the law of treasonapplies, although this does not mean that we ought not alsoto take the proposed emergency powers for use. in cases inwhich it would be inexpedient to invoke the law of treason orto which that lav/ would not apply.Somewhat similar considerations- arise in regard toS.189(1) of the Army Act, where active service is defined as meaning operations against &quot;the enemy&quot;.      The expression is used&apos; elsewhere throughout the Act, e,g.  in Section k.      it isquite possible of course that the expression &quot;enemy&quot; in this context may bear a different meaning to that which wouldattach to the word elsewhere.      Are the forces in Malaya on active service because the bandits are to be considered, forthis purpose, the enemy?     I am inclined to think so.      It Istrue that in connection with the lav/ of treason rebels withinthe realm are not to be regarded as the King&apos;s enemies(R.  v.  Shearcs 1798 27 State Tv 255, p.388. 391).      &quot;The Realm&quot;does not,  of course, include Colonies.      I think, however, thatin the context of the Army Act the expression enemy is moreloosely used and probably covers those who are in an organisedmilitary way resisting His Majesty&apos;s forces by force and arras.On this&apos; view I have already advised that our troops in Koreawill, &quot;be on active service although for the sake of abundantcaution a declaration will be made under Section 189(2)  (Note (3

As for the position under-the Foreign Enlistment Act.I have little doubt that for the purposes of Section % of.theAct North and South Korea are foreign States and, so far as -they are concerned, that they are &quot;at war&quot; within the meaning of the Section. The term &quot;war&quot; in Section h has a widermeaning than it may bear in contexts of international law and includes civil war. It follows that assuming that HisMajesty is at peace with South Korea    (and this at least maysafely be assumed.&apos;), enlistment in the forces of North Koreawould constitute a criminal offence.      The correspondingquestion whether enlistment in the forces of South Korea would constitute an offence depends on whether His Majesty is atpeace with North Korea.      Although it may be true that v/e arenot at war with that country I find it quite impossible to saythat we are at peace with North Korea.      I think, therefore,that enlistment in the South Korean forces would not be an offence.      It is indeed arguable from the preamble that theAct only applies when both, the warring States are at peacewith His Majesty, and that the object of the Act was to preserveHis Majesty&apos;s neutrality:    on this view it would not apply atall to the present conflict, a result which would enableBritish subjects to serve in the North Korean forces withimpunity unless the law of treason applied.      In my view,however, there is no need to resort to the preamble for thepurpose of interpreting Section U of the Act, and under that section it would be an offence for a British subject to enlistin the Northern Korean forces, quite apart from the questionwhether so to do would constitute treason.There is one curious commentary on the fact that weshould now be discussing the question whether v/e are at warwith Korea.      As long ago as the hth October, I9h6, I drew attention to the question whether wo were not any longer at v/arwith Germany,      I suggested then that iv view of the greatimportance and far reaching implication of the general conclu-sions.which I indicated, in that Opinion, it might be desirable,to have consultations with, the American Government in order toascertain what view they tool: as to the precise status of theControl Council and of the Courts in Germany.      We referred tothe matter again in an Opinion dated 2nd April,  1948, and again in one&quot; dated 18th February, 194:9*      I do not know what,if any, consultation has taken place in regard to these mattersbut  someday, before long, v/e shall find ourselves in a very embarrassing position in the Courts and the Foreign secretary will have to decide whether he can, as lie did In the case ofKuchenmeister, give a Certificate that v/e are still at war.This last paragraph is, however, merely by the&apos;way.I am sorry to bother you with so long a minute in regard to themore immediately important questions concerning the Koreanconflict, but I think you would wish to consider these matters and it would be most helpful to me to know your views.      you may indeed think that there should, be some informal consulta-tion with the Judges and possibly that the Lord Chief Justiceshould see part of this Minute?X        X        X        XNotes:(1)    It has been reported that the Foreign Secretaryreferred to. the Korean conflict as a civil war.If so, this must have been by inadvertence.      Itis important not so to describe it.      The United.Nations is not entitled to take part in a civil v(2)   And of the Canadian Prime Minister.(3)    For what it is worth.      Probably it docs not cover the present position.

COPY OF LETTER PROM THE LORD chancellor to THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL        :p HOUSE OF LORDS,  S.W.1.12th September, 1950.XXXI have read your Minute about the legal implications of the situation in Korea with great interest.    It does, as yousay, raise questions of great and far-reaching importance.I must say that I think that the position so far as our own municipal law is concerned is a great deal clearerthan the position in international law.    I agree with you that there appears to be no reason why the law of treasonshould not apply to those who lend aid and comfortto  the North Koreans, although I do not think that it byany means follows that those who engage in Communist propaganda,such as that exemplified by &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;, commit anyoffence covered by the law of treason.    Nevertheless, if we aresatisfied that the law of treason applies to the state ofaffairs in Korea,  then there is much to be said for yoursuggestion that some clear declaration should be made onthis subject.    The difficulty about this, of course, isthat the declaration,  if made at all,  ought to have beenmade many weeks ago.I also agree with what you say about the ForeignEnlistment Act and section I89 of the Army Act.    I think there can be no doubt that anyone engaging In the forces of theNorth Koreans commits an offence against section b, of theForeign Enlistment Act.The position in international law seems to meto be far from clear, but I find it hard to believe that,notwithstanding the Charter of the United Nations and the pact of Paris of 1928, what is going on in Korea is not a war andthat His Majesty is not at v/ar with the North Koreans.The Pact of Paris outlawed war as an instrument of national policy,  but that does not mean that a State which is defendingitself when attacked is not engaged in war, and the positionseems to me to be the same in the case of members of the united nations engaged in warlike operations on behalf of the united nations.    I think,  however, that, as you say in your Minute,this is a matter on which it is really essential that weshould, if possible, reach agreement with the highest legalauthorities in the United States.I understand that the War Office may raise thequestion of the desirability of extending the protection afforded by the Courts (Emergency Powers) Act and the Liabilities (War-time Adjustment) Acts to reservists and others called up for service in Korea,    As you know, we .decided that these Acts shouldbe brought to an end this month.   Even if it is thought necessaryto provide some protection for those persons who are now being called up,  it is perhaps doubtful whether the Acts I have mentioned are apt for the purpose.    The Acts may be invokedwhere a defendant finds himself in difficulties by reason of

circumstances directly or indirectly attributable to any war in which His Majesty may be engaged.   This appearsdirectly to raise the question,  discussed in your Minute,whether His Majesty is at war in Korea.   Whatever the answer to this may be, my present impression is that if protectionis needed, for what concerns quite a small number of people,at present at any rate,  it should be afforded by means ofad hoc legislation and not by continuing the Courts (emergency powers) Act, the repeal of which is really now long overdue.X      X      XCOPY OK LETTER FROM THE ATTORNEY-^GENERAL&apos;   TO THE LORD CHANCELLOR .13th September, 1950.XXXThank you for your letter of the 12th September inregard to my minute about the legal implications of thesituation in Korea.    I am very glad to know your views about it,I must say that I have always shared your doubt whether in international law the position is not simply one ofwar.    President Truman has,  however, been expressly asked andhas expressly stated that the United States is not at war andis merely acting under the United Nations in the conduct of a police operation.    I showed Eric Beckett a copy of thememorandum and he agrees with it and, in particular, with thispart of it.    I think Lauterpacht also holds this view.    The truthis, however,  that if we say that this is the position and thatthere is some distinction between what is going on now and war as hitherto understood, we shall be creating new internationallaw and it is, therefore, of the utmost importance that we should try and reach agreement with the Americans about it.   V/hat doyou siggest should now be done?    Shall I circulate a cabinet paper setting out my views and suggesting that steps should betaken to secure the necessary consultation at the highest level?So far as concerns the question of treason, all thatI was really concerned about was the question whether the lav/of treason applies to the present state of affairs.    If it does,we must, of course, consider possible cases on their merits.The Daily Worker have a war correspondent attached to the north korean Forces.    No doubt if he were to broadcast from north korea he would be giving aid and comfort to the enemy and Iam not sure that his despatches may not have the same effectalthough, of course,  I do not contemplate a prosecution in existing circumstances.

If we do raise the matter at the Cabinet,  it may bethat an appropriate way of dealing with the positionsubsequently so far as our municipal law is concerned,would be for me to make some reference to the matter more orless casually in the course of a speech on foreign affairs,rather taking it for granted that everybody understands thatthe law of treason does apply.X     X     XCOPY OP LETTER FROM THE LORD chancellor to&quot;&quot;THE ATTORNEY-GENERALHOUSE OF LORDS,  S.W.1.13th September, 1950.XX     XThank you for your letter   of the 13thSeptember about Korea.I think it is clear that We shall have to discuss this matter in the Cabinet as a preliminary to an endeavourto reach agreement with the Americans as to the position in international law. I. should be glad, therefore, if, as you suggest, you will circulate a Cabinet Paper setting out your views.If we agree that the lav/ of treason applies whetheror not the position is one of v/ar in international law, thenI think the suggestion in the last paragraph of your letter ofthe 13th September v/ould be the best way of drawing attentionto the point.XXX
