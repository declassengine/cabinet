ANNEXTHIS   DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTSECRET COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS OFFICE PRINTOctober 16, 1950C.R.O. Ref.: U 3030/15SOUTH AFRICAN POLICY RE INDIANS AND AFRICANSUnited Kingdom Acting High Commissioner in India to Mr. Garner,Commonwealth Relations OfficeOffice of the High Commissionerfor the United Kingdom,6, Albuquerque Road, New Delhi,My dear Garner, 17th August, 1950.I have not had any very suitable opportunity recently to speak to the Indiansabout their dispute with South Africa, but I have had the impression that Pakistanefforts to modify the Indian attitude of opposition to a round-table conference are unlikely to succeed. I had a farewell visit yesterday from Y. D. Gundevia who hasuntil recently been the joint Secretary dealing with South African affairs and whowas Pandit Kunzru&apos;s main official adviser at the talks in South Africa some months ago. He has just been appointed Minister to Moscow. He told me that theIndian Government could not enter a round-table conference now and was critical of the Pakistan attitude. As he has only relinquished his work in the Ministry aweek ago I think we can safely assume that his attitude is likely to be that of theIndian Government.2. Gundevia went on to say that the Indian delegation had returned from south Africa profoundly depressed about the future of South Africa and withoutany hope of reaching agreement. The main reason for their depression had beena very straight talk With Donges which I have not seen recorded elsewhere andwhich may, therefore, be worth bringing to your attention. Gundevia told me thatDonges had told Pandit Kunzru and himself that the position of the Europeans inSouth Africa was similar to that which the British had held in India. The Britishhad eventually been compelled to relinquish that position and to leave the country.The Europeans in South Africa realised that a day would probably come when theycould no longer hold their position against the Africans and when they would be forced to abandon the country. But the present South African Government was determined to put off the evil day as long as possible and at least to ensure that it did not come for a minimum period of seventy years.3. Donges went on to say that the British had accelerated their own departure from India by educating the Indians and preparing them for self-government. TheSouth Africans had no intention of repeating this mistake.4. As regards the Indian dispute, Donges admitted that India was a greatcountry with a great culture and that the Indians were in a very different position from the African natives. On the other hand, the South African Governmentcould not meet the wishes of the Indian minority without being compelled to do something for the African natives which they could not contemplate.5. Gundevia went on to tell me that he was quite convinced that an explosionwould occur in South Africa before many years. He had never seen such bitternessand hatred as he had found universally among the Africans. He said that at the worst period in India there had never been dislike of the British as individuals or as administrators. The position was quite different in South Africa. He con-trasted this atmosphere with that in the British Colonies in East Africa where the natives were happy and relatively carefree. He recognised that our aim was toprepare the Africans for self-government at a reasonable rate. He warned me.however, that if trouble broke out in South Africa it would certainly spread and theexcellence of our intentions would not save us from serious native unrest in ourColonies also.6. The above should not, of course, be regarded as an expression of theofficial view of the Ministry of External Affairs, but Gundevia is a sensible official
and it is, I think, worth knowing how his mind is working after a long experience ofIndian relations with South Africa.7.   I am sending a copy of this letter to Baring in Pretoria.Yours sincerely,FRANK K. ROBERTS.J. J. S. Garner, Esq., C.M.G.,Commonwealth Relations Office,Downing Street, London, S.W. 1.United Kingdom High Commissioner in the Union of South Africa to Sir Cecil Syers,Commonwealth Relations office no. P/637Office of the High Commissionerfor the United Kingdom, Pretoria,My dear Syers, 21th September, 1950.Roberts&apos; letter of 17th August about his talk with Gundevia is very interesting.I will-discuss it in relation to the United Party and the Nationalist Party, to Dongesas a man, and to the course of future events in this country.2. Liberal members of the United Party have long been full of good intentions and only too eager to give expression to fine general principles. For long theylacked, however, a programme of betterment for non-Europeans. They did not envisage a sequence of possible acts by the Government starting with the least andending with the most politically dangerous. Instead either they advocated measuressuch as the complete abolition of the Pass LawsCJ, which the electorate would notstomach or, like Hofmeyr, they went so far in their eagerness to prove their good faith to the best educated Africans that, by starting with the emphasis on franchiserights (at the wrong end of any programme of betterment) they played into thehands of their astute and ruthless opponents. What was needed was a decisionon the priorities of the various needs of the Africans. This was exactly what theGovernment of India delegation, led by Sir Muhammad Habibullah, did before the cape Town Conference of 1927. Its members pressed for economic benefits for &quot;South African Indians, they abstained from all mention of political rights; andthey succeeded in their mission. To some extent the Fagan Commission(2) did this for the United Party. The Commissioners confined their proposals to those actswhich a courageous government could perform without losing power, and this mighthave enabled the United Party to reach decisions on priorities.3. The basic problem for white South Africa is to come to terms with its ownAfricans and to make life in a mixed state tolerable for the black man. For all their lack of unity, their idleness and their woolly thinking, the United Party realisethis. A tragedy of South African history is that when in the first half of 1948 theFagan Commission reported on the condition of urban Natives, General Smuts at last came to believe that it was not enough to define the problem but that action was required.   Within a month, as you know, he had lost power.4. Had the United Party retained power in the General Election of May 1948,I believe therefore that they would have done certain things that the Nationalistshave not done. To my mind the Africans in this country need better housing, moresecurity, more jobs in the professions and still more in skilled manual labour, and finally the beginning of some sort of at least local political rights and responsibilities.An advance should have been made step by step on a programme covering thesematters.O The Pass Laws originally provided for documents to identify and control the movements of Natives. Passes (which are required in nearly all cities and large towns) now include a registeredservice contract; a pass to look for work; a badge for casual labour; a prescribed document to enter the area not for the purpose of seeking or taking up work; the night pass; permits under localregulations such as lodgers and visitors permits in the locations. An identification pass must beproduced if a Native wishes to obtain a travelling pass to elsewhere than his home, and every maleNative liable to poll tax must carry his receipt. Certain Natives because of their status, higher education, experience of western civilization, long good standing, &amp;c, are entitled to exemption.(2) l.e., the Native Laws Commission, which consisted of Mr. Justice Fagan (Chairman) whohad been a Nationalist Minister for Native Affairs under General Hertzog, an Afrikaans-speakingfarmer, a lawyer who was for several years legal adviser to the Native Affairs Department of theJohannesburg City Council, and a retired officer of the Union Government Native Affairs Department.The real subject of the enquiry was the position of the town labourer of African race.
5. Just before they lost office the United Party accepted the main thesis of theFagan Commission. This was that in the new industrial South Africa manyAfricans must live under family conditions in the towns. As a result they came to envisage South Africa as a country in which on the one hand through economic development in the Reserves some Africans would become permanent farmers, andon the other hand through increased provision of housing adjacent to the townsother Africans would become permanently resident town dwellers. The numberof migrant labourers living part of their lives in the Reserves and part of their livesas temporary workers in towns, mines or farms, separated from their families would consequently gradually decrease. This is the right and indeed the only objective.In May 1948, it had at long last been accepted, and there is much evidence that thefollowing actions would have flown from its aceptance:  (i) The provision of houses mainly sub-economic houses by the Govern-ment on a national scale for town-dwelling Africans. The result wouldhave been the abolition of the squatter camps and the creation along the south of the Rand of a line of African townships with-Governmentsubsidised housing, Government subsidised transport into the Randtowns, and the gradual development of something like Africanmunicipal government in those townships.(ii) More security for the town-dwelling African than exists at present.Thus (a) provision had already been made for his participation, though on a lower scale than Europeans or Coloured persons, in old-age pensions, disability pensions, unemployment insurance and thevarious forms of social security which are essential if the workingpeople of an industrial state are to be reasonably happy andcontented.(b) General Smuts&apos;s Government intended to simplify the Pass laws and to cause their administration to be less severe than it is atpresent. This apparently minor administrative change is of real importance. At the moment a large number of town Africansare fined or go to gaol for small offences which involve no greatermoral turpitude than parking in the wrong place. A reform onthese lines, along with the provision of more schools in the towns,would have prevented the manufacture of criminals which atpresent goes on daily. The trouble is that in the towns Africanchildren (about two-thirds of those of school-going age) who cannot be fitted into the schools take to crime and harmlessAfricans who are imprisoned for minor offences find themselvescheek by jowl in crowded gaols with hardened criminals.(iii) There are many posts in the Government Service and in the professionswhich in African areas Africans might fill. Both parties have given lipservice to this reform. It is also essential in the future to apprentice and&apos; to train African manual labourers certainly for work in Native Reserves,possibly, under some limitation of numbers, for work in the towns.The crux here is the training of apprentices since at present a fewAfricans may attend a trade school but none can be apprenticed. Tomake progress will be exceedingly difficult in view of the strong feeling among white trade unionists. Whereas there is definite evidence thatthe United Party were about to face the problems of more houses andreform of the Pass Laws and had already done much for social security,there is no evidence that they would have done more than the nationalists in order to provide increased openings for the employmentof Africans. On the other hand, there is little doubt that on this matter,too, they would have been more open to persuasion than their opponents.(iv) The United Party had definite plans for increasing the power of Africandistrict and of regional councils in Native Reserves and for giving someresponsibility to the central Natives&apos; Representative Council which sitsat Pretoria. They also accepted the Fagan proposals for the establish-ment of embryo Native municipal councils in the new Native townshipsto be built throughout the country. The first of these aims, regardingdistrict and regional councils in the Reserves, is accepted in principle by39431-5 b 2
the Nationalists. They, however, reject the second, regarding Natives&apos;Representative Council, and also the third because in this matter, as iothose of more houses, of more schools, and of more social security forthe urban African, they are inhibited by their intense desire to reduce to the barest minimum the number of Africans who live under familyconditions in the towns. In fact it is often said that the crux of the differences between the two parties is the question: &quot;Where shallNative women live?&quot;6. The United Party may have been slow and slack and timid in their move-ment towards meeting the needs of the Africans. The Nationalists simply do notface the problem. They are fundamentally the party of defeatism: they do not really accept the possibility of white South Africa coming to terms with the Africans.Since they gained power no new contracts for Native housing have been placed bythe big municipalities in South Africa because the Government and the local autho-rities cannot agree on finance; Pass Law reform has been dropped; nearly allAfricans have been cut off from the benefits of unemployment insurance. Graduallyby experience Nationalist Ministers are learning that many Africans must live withtheir wives and children in the towns. But the average member of the Party stilltakes refuge in the pipe dreams of Dr. Eiselen, a Professor of Anthropology, whois now Secretary for Native Affairs. Eiselen has produced many reasons, somegood and nearly all attractive to white South Africans, to show the desirability ofcarving out of modern South Africa a separate black State which he namesBantustan. He has said very little about how this is to be done. The truth isthat though in the present state of white opinion in this country Dr. Eiselen&apos;sobjective might be desirable, it is totally impracticable. But for Nationalists it hasthe advantage of avoiding the formulation of practical proposals of the type men-tioned in paragraph 4, since were action taken on such proposals the effectiveness of apartheid as a political slogan might well be damaged. In short, the typicalNationalist is both a defeatist and an escapist, partly because this attitude enableshim to take that short-term view which has recently proved so effective in defeatinghis political opponents, partly because he belongs to a party whose stock in tradeis emotional appeals and not reason, and partly because he is an ignorant man who finds it very difficult to think ahead. If this were not so it would be impossibleto explain the actions of a party which declares that complete and unqualified whitesupremacy is its main plank yet discourages white immigration.7. Donges himself is, however, a man with brains. At moments when hisreason rises above his emotions he must realise that he and his colleagues are living in a dream world. But these moments are few, and the conversation reported show show remarkably strong are the emotional forces which affect all members of theGovernment party, whether they are blessed with brains or not.8. I will now turn from the party and from Donges as a man to the courseof future events. I do not think that the remarks made to Pundit Kunzru throwmuch light on these. As Gundevia is reported in paragraph 5 of Roberts&apos;s letteras having remarked, feeling between black and white is bad and getting worsethough this trend is far more pronounced in the towns than in the country reserves.I also share his view that the effects of serious trouble in South Africa would be felt elsewhere on the African Continent. It is moreover possible that there willbe an explosion in South Africa if by this is meant an attempt by Africans to bettertheir position by force; but I do not think that they will succeed. At present thereis no real threat to white supremacy in South Africa but only a potential threat.The following, among others, are the reasons:  (1) Africans have at present neither the weapons nor the leaders for a success-ful armed revolt.(2) Since the time of the Durban riots the attempts of the South AfricanCommunist Party to create a united anti-European front have been unsuccessful. There is no sign of the development of sufficient goodfeeling between the various non-European races for a movement to arise combining Indian brains with African brawn. . When I was first inthis country twenty years ago the rural African disliked the Indian tradermuch as the Muslim peasant of the Punjab dislikes the Hindu merchant and money lender. On the other hand in the poorer quarters of DurbanTamil-speaking working class Indians and Zulus mixed freely in cinemas,boxing matches and at hot-dog stalls, and relations were generally cheer-ful and friendly. Now there has been a big change. Both the Nationalist
Government and some Natal Europeans are encouraging the develop-ment of ill-feeling between Indians and Africans, and the idea is beingspread among &quot;Africans that the Group Areas Act will save not onlythe Europeans but also the Africans from Indian &quot; penetration &quot; and provide the opportunity for Africans to replace Indians as shop keepers,bus owners, &amp;c. in the poorer areas.(3) The whole conception of passive resistance as developed by Gandhi isforeign to the Bantu mentality. In any case at present there are neitherthe leaders nor the money for an organised passive resistance move-ment; and the recent attempt on these lines by Natal Indians was acomplete fiasco.(4) If really serious trouble develops South Africans of European descent willbe fighting with their backs to the wall with no retreat. The comparisonwith India is therefore fallacious. It is possible that with help from out-side organisers and outside money a campaign of strikes, boycotts and sabotage by African workers might be organised, but the counterattack would be very strong. There can be little comparison betweenthe humane Government of India of the days before 1947, and anySouth African Government threatened by a really serious movementamong non-Europeans to gain power.9. Apart from the general future course of events there is the fate of SouthAfrican Indians. The views of South Africans of European descent have moved along way since 1927. The Nationalists definitely hope to remove from the country the great majority of South African Indians. Among many English-speaking south africans, especially in Natal, the Nationalist policy on this point is approved. the tactics which may well be followed in order to get rid of the South African Indiansmay be a combination of bribery and pressure. As a bribe I would expect theUnion Government to be ready to offer very generous compensation terms to thoseIndians owning property here who are willing to go. Ministers regard their readiness-ness to give this compensation as a big bargaining card at any conference which maybe held. Pressure we may expect to come from the use of the Group Areas Act indue course to squeeze Indian traders out of the European and Native areas andconfine Indian residence to the areas at present occupied by Indians. These, as theIndian population grows, will become more and more congested. Even so, nine-tenths of the Indians have been born in this country. They are used to its climate,to the absence of the caste system, to something like a European way of life, andI doubt whether that sort of pressure would cause many more to be willing to goto India than were prepared to go under the Assisted Emigration Scheme twenty years ago.10. What would happen next is very much a matter for speculation. But therehave been sinister hints that we might then expect some fresh Durban riots. Shouldfear induce the bulk of the Indians to go, the Union Government would probablybe ready to improve the position of the rest. We may also see an attempt to separate Pakistan from India by an arrangement to bring more pressure to bear onHindus than on Moslems.11. At the moment the Nationalists are anxious to gain ground in Natal. a campaign has been set on foot. The English-speaking residents in Natal are to be told that the United Party would never dare enforce as harsh measures againstthe Indians as the Nationalists now intend to take. They will therefore be askedto support a Government which may not share their views on the British connectionbut which alone (it will be said) is prepared to take the only measures capable of saving them from being swamped by an Indian population increasing at a ratemore than 50 per cent greater than that of either the Europeans or the Africans inthe Province. Nationalists on this issue pay little attention to criticisms from abroad.Indeed they know that much of the criticism reinforces their electoral position.12. Finally, I think that that part of Gundevia&apos;s report of Donges&apos;s remarks,which is mentioned in paragraph 2 of Roberts&apos;s letter should be taken with a pinchof salt. Donges may well have spoken on the lines mentioned in paragraphs 3 and4 of Roberts&apos;s letter and, although the Government of India deny it, the balance ofthe evidence is, I think, that he told Pundit Kunzru pretty frankly although in very general terms of the proposals subsequently embodied in the Group Areas Bill.But I also think that in paragraph 2 there has been some confusion. I have neverheard Nationalists compare their own position with that of the British in India. Onthe contrary I recently listened to Sauer explaining to Lord Pakenham that theposition was entirely different because, he said, Afrikaners had no home except
in South Africa, had no place of retreat and had not been colonists for the last300 years. The analogy is, however, one that I would expect an Indian to suggest.It is perfectly possible that in order to avoid an argument and the trouble of thinkingvery far ahead, Donges admitted that after the next half century the white manmight be driven out of South Africa by force. But I do not think that from thisstray pessimistic conclusion we can draw any conclusions about the future actions of the Nationalist Government. The fact that something on these lines was saiddoes, however, I suggest throw an interesting side light on the weakness of the nationalists as framers of a long term policy for South Africa.13.   I am sending a copy of this letter to Roberts.Yours sincerely,E. BARING.
