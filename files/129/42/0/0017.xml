68DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(50) 21725TH SEPTEMBER, 1950CABINETAMERICAN PROPOSALS FOR strengthening the CAPACITY OF THE UNITED NATIONS TODEAL WITH AGGRESSIONMemorandum by the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign affairs at their meeting on 11th September (C. M. (50) 57th Conclusions,Minute l), the Cabinet considered the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum(C. P. (50) 197) which dealt with the American proposal that members of theUnited Nations should be asked to earmark units within their national forces for possible use in response to recommendations of the General Assembly.At the same time the Cabinet considered the memorandum circulated bythe Attorney-General (CP, (50) 205) which pointed out some of the legal difficulties involved in such a proposal.    The Cabinet had previously, onthe 4th September (CM. (50) 55th Conclusions, Minute 5), discussed theother parts of the American proposals on the basis of the Foreign Secretary&apos;smemorandum C. P. (50) 196.COPY NO.   J Z2. At the conclusion of their consideration of this question onUth September, the Cabinet authorised the Foreign Secretary to exploresympathetically with the United States Secretary of State the proposal toearmark national contingents to be used on behalf of the United Nations on a recommendation of the General Assembly;   but invited him to avoid committing himself in principle in favour of this proposal and to ensure thatthe serious legal and practical difficulties of the proposal were fully investigated (CM. (50) 57th Conclusions, Minute 1(2)).3. The Minister of State accordingly discussed this question further on 19th September with the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General.Consideration was also given to the earlier proposals which had been discussed by the Cabinet on 4th September and an attempt was made to assess the legal and practical difficulties involved in these American proposals taken as awhole.    The general conclusion was that although it would be difficult, and perhaps impossible, to reconcile these proposals wholly with the spirit andletter of the Charter, our final attitude towards them would, nevertheless, haveto be decided on political rather than on purely legal considerations.    that being so, it was of the utmost importance that any proposals which finallyemerge from discussions in New York, and which we should ourselves feel able to support, should also have the support of a substantial majority of themembers of the United Nations including the more responsible members, andin particular, the other Commonwealth countries,

As a result of this meeting agreed telegrams-were sent tothe Foreign Secretary in New York (telegrams Nos.  1349 and 1350).The texts of these telegrams, as well as of telegrams sent to the high commissioners in the Commonwealth countries which are members ofthe United Nations, are annexed for the information of the Cabinet.E.

ANNEXFROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO NEW YORK(United Kingdom Delegation to United Nations)No.  13*4-920th September, 1950.My telegram. No.  1118 (of 5th September) and No.  1202(of 12th September) and Cabinet conclusions and Attorney-General&apos; s paper relating to American proposals for strengtheningAssembly.Following for Secretary of State from Makins.Question was discussed last night at House ofCommons with both Law Officers and Minister of State, Beckettand United Nations (Political) Department.    Conclusions of thismeeting were as follows:-(l)   . For reasons elaborated in my immediately following telegram,  the American proposals taken as a whole are probably in conflict with the provisions of the Charteras the Hague Court would interpret them.(2)      On other hand,  these proposals or something on theselines are probably the only alternative to a confessionthat, owing to the veto in the Security Council,  theUnited Nations is powerless even to recommend action incases where breaches of the peace take place and therewill be no way if in the future an incident similar to that of korea breaks out of aggression being fought under theUnited Nations umbrella.(3)      If as the result of consultations in the corridors itappears that there will be a two-thirds majority forproposals along these lines and  if this two-thirds majority may be regarded as respectable majoritybecause it includes all the Commonwealth countries andIndia in particular, then it was considered that it wouldbe politically most undesirable for the United kingdom to oppose them on purely legal grounds. my immediately following telegram shows, a certain argumentcan be made in the legal justification of these proposalseven though all the lawyers at the meeting agree thatthese arguments should probably not prevail if the matter were before the Hague Court,    In any case it is most improbable that these questions would be submitted tothe Hague Court for its opinion.(A)      If,  on the other hand,  it does not appear thatthere would be the majority indicated above in favourof these proposals and particularly if the commonwealth would be split on this matter, India&apos;s position beingregarded here as particularly important, it would be far better that these -proposals were never officiallyput forward, -(5)      It may be that the Americans will&apos;consider themselves so far committed  to bringing forward proposals on these lines that they will insist on doing sobefore it is ascertained that there is likely to be

71f. ithe majority indicated above in their favour.    Inthat case we suggest that you should do everythingyou can to persuade the United States to formulatein the general debate their proposals in the vaguestpossible manner and  not at this stage to table anyactual resolutions so that the United Kingdom in theopening debate could express approval of the ideawithout being committed, to anything in detail.(6)        Law Officers say, and indicate that Lord Chancelloragrees with this view,  that they would not wish, on the purely legal grounds which may by some be thought tobe somewhat technical,  to oppose -support of the UnitedStates proposals on the conditions indicated above.On the other hand, the following points were stressed.Even were the proposed machinery in being,  the matter*   - could not be brought before the Assembly without a tooobvious breach of the Charter if the incident were onthe agenda of the Security Council.    There might thenbe further delay while the Slavs attempt to obstructour efforts to remove the item from the agenda by aprocedural vote.    Further,  these resolutions makeit almost inevitable that all such incidents should bebrought before the Assembly, and it may be in some future incident that a two-thirds vote cannot beobtained for the right course.    In that event we andothers on the right side would find ourselves in aworse position before world opinion than if v/e hadacted simply by collective self-defence on the basis thatit could not be brought before the Assembly at all.Finally, perhaps the most serious objection is thedanger that United States resolutions once acceptedmight bring about a feeling of false security in thatwhen the moment for action comes the protective system which the United States proposal seeks to introduce mayturn out to be illusory.2. In any event we hope that the Americans can bedissuaded from tabling immediately the text of theirresolutions as they stand at the moment.    It would perhaps be  sufficient for them to indicate their general tenor intheir opening speech.    We would certainly wish to considerthe drafting, particularly of the preamble and of resolution A,(if the United States persist in it)  in order to soften down itsperhaps unnecessarily provocative character and also to minimise the apparent contradiction with the letter of the Charter,    Onthe other hand,  there was expressed at the meeting the viewthat the United Kingdom would be somewhat inconsistent in supportingB and C while opposing the purpose of A:    if C is to work at all,something like A has necessarily got to take place, and thiswould inevitably come to light In discussions.    On the other hand,A might, without making any fundamental change in the characterof the American scheme, be made less detailed.    In particular,it may be undesirable to specify that an emergency session isonly to be called under the -precise conditions at present therelaid down.    We still think that all this could best be achieved by amendment to the Rules of procedure.. We fi-01 sure that you will agree with us that it is most important that the Commonwealth countries should stand firmlytogether on this issue and that the attitude of India is particularly important,    hew Delhi telegram No.  2.602. shows that the first Indianreaction was unfavourable.    We feel that this was in part due tothe manner in which the proposals were explained to them by theUnited States Charge a&quot; Affaires and we therefore propose to ask

the United Kingdom High Commissioner to explain our own attitude to  the Indian Government.    V/e propose to take similar action withthe other Commonwealth Governmentsi    as you know we have been prevented hitherto from doing this  (except in the.case of Canada)by the uncertainty which v/e have felt about our own attitude.V/e hope that it will be possible to take parallel action with commonwealth delegations in New York.h. Minister of State approved general lines of this  .and immediately following telegram before&apos; departing for New York.FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO NEW YORK(To United Kingdom Delegation to United Nations)No. 1550September 20th, 1950.My- immediately preceding telegram.This discussion resulted in the  legal questionsbeing gone into rather more deeply  than they had been previouslyat the Foreign Office or in the Attorney-General&apos;s writtenopinion.    We started from the position that the Charterentrusts the Security Council with  the primary (not exclusive)responsibility for peace and security, and. that the Assemblyhas a subsidiary role in this sphere, which is defined in articles 11 and 12.    Thus,  the Security Council being the rule and&apos; the Assembly being the exception in this sphere, itmust be held that the role of the Assembly is more or lessexhaustively defined in these two Articles.    It appears fromArticles 11 and 12 that the Assembly has a power to make recommendations in the sphere of peace and security in two cases: -(a) It may recommend general principles in theabstract to be applicable to any case as it arises (Articleii(D);(b) It- may discuss and make recommendations relatingto particular cases under Article 11(2), but the languagei.e. &quot;questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security&quot;  (n.b.  not &quot;restoration&quot;)   coupled with the reference to Article 35(2),  does strongly indicate that thisis a Chapter VI  jurisdiction and not a Chapter VII one.    Inother words,  there is nothing in Articles 11 and 12 which gives the -assembly any jurisdiction over breaches of the peace,and acts of aggression.2. Having given to the Assembly this&apos; jurisdictionlimited to  these two classes of cases, Articles 11 and 12proceed to place two limitations or conditions on the exerciseof that &quot;limited jurisdiction,  namelys(l)    that the Assembly is not to make recommendations with regard to any situation when that situation is on the agenda of the Security Council (which is what Article 12(1) probablymeans)  and

(2)    that if it wants to recommend action it mustrefer the matter to the Security Council.It could be argued - although the Attorney-General doubtsthe soundness of the argument - that these two conditions would not really hamper the American proposals because:(i)    ex hypothesi the Security Council will have failed before  the Assembly takes the matter up, and(ii)    the Assembly could refer its recommendations to the Security Council by inserting a paragraph that its recommendations should be referred there but should remainoperative unless the Security Council by affirmative votedecides otherwise.    But in any case Article 11, even ona fairly sympathetic interpretation, does not appear togive the General Assembly any jurisdiction when a breach of the peace has actually taken place.3. We only intend here to give the outlines of theprincipal points which emerged in this legal discussion,though the conclusions reached can be supported by furtherarguments based on the general scheme of the Charter.k* If? however,  the United Kingdom has to supportaction which is inconsistent with what is suggested above to be the true interpretation   ;f the Charter, we shouldhave to argue,  if necessary,   that the phrase &quot;any questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security&quot; in Article 11(2)  is not in fact exactly thesame expression as is used in Chapter VI, and thereforemust be interpreted as having- a wider meaning.    There arealso other places in the Charter where the expression&quot;maintain international peace and security&quot; is used without theadditional word &quot;restore&quot;, though the clear meaningthere is &quot;maintain or restore&quot;.    We would further pointout that the actual reference to Article 35(2)  only applies to a question brought before  the Assembly by a non-member state  (and not by a Member or the Security Council)  and itmay well be said that the Security Council has the right,under this Article,  to bring, even a breach of the peace,if it so wishes,  before the General Assembly.

This desire is based on recognition,that it was only lucky chance of Soviet absence from security council in June and. July which made it possible for promp action to be taken in case of Korea.      They had therefore putforward for discussion throe draft resolutions which could either be taken separately or as a whole (texts of which are containedin my immediately following telegram). -   Resolution A providesfor special session of the Assembly to be called at 2h hoursnotice should emergency arise.      Resolution B sets tip &quot;StandingPeace Reconnaissance Commission&quot; to enable observers to be sentto any threatened area at short notice by General Assembly orby Interim Committee (when Assembly is not in Session).Resolution C recommends that members of United Nations shouldearmark certain units within their national armed forces whichcould be available for prompt  service on behalf of United Nationseither upon determination by Security Council or recommendation by General Assembly.      This resolution appoints military co-coordinator to assist in co-ordinating establishment of such, units.It also goes on to establish Ad hoc Committee to study andreport to General Assembly means which United Nations mightemploy through collective action,  including use of armed forces,in order to carry out purposes of Charter.2. Our attitude to these proposals is governed byfollowing considerations:    We realise that it would be impossibleto maintain that these proposals taken as a whole are strictlyconsistent with spirit and letter of Charter,      On other hand,it seems intolerable that Soviet abuse of veto should be allowedto reduce United Nations to impotence in face of  aggression.Moreover, Assembly may within limits interpret for itself pro-visions of the Charter.     We feel therefore that  some action on lines of American proposals is desirable, so long as we can besure that it will secure support in.. Assembly of two-thirds majority (including more responsible members and in particularCommonwealth members).      We feel that it would do more harm than good to put forward such proposals if they were only in event tosecure support  of,  say, Western    European powers and the LatinAmericans.      Further factor which we have borne in mind in con-sidering American proposals is that we would wish if possible toavoid framing them in such a way as to make them unduly provoca-tive to Russians and possibly cause them to withdraw altogetherfrora United Nat1 ons.

3&apos; &apos; Since it is not yet clear what degree  of supportwill be forthcoming for proposals on these lines and since wewould wish to urge certain modifications to them, it isfortunate that Americans did not table their draft resolutionas they stand in opening debate, although they did givefairly clear indication of what they propose to put forward.k. Our net,ailed views on American draft resolutionsare as follows:    We think that Resolution A in its presentdetailed form is unnecessary since its object (i. e. toensure that the General Assembly can be summoned at short notice in an emergency) can be equally well achieved by a simple amendment to Assembly&apos;s rules of procedure.      Thiscourse would have additional advantage of being less pro-vocative and of omitting specific references, both inresolution A and preamble, to powers of the General assembly which might be held to be of doubtful legal validity.      Weshould be prepared to support resolution B provided thatnecessity for a two-thirds majority in Interim Committeefor decisions to send out observers to an area is retained.We are prepared to give sympathetic consideration to aproposal on lines of Resolution C although necessity for adequate support by responsible members is particularly important in this case.      We are dubious about proposal inResolution C to establish an Ad Hoc Committee since it  isnot clear what  its practical functions will be or whetherit is really necessary.      There is further danger that itmay feel called upon to make detailed study of powers whichAssembly might be said to have, in which case, as indicated above, its conclusions might be of doubtful legal validity.We would much prefer in general to avoid taking up an attitude upon precise powers of Assembly in dealing withbreaches of peace or acts of aggression until case was actually upon us and majority of Assembly was of opinionthat it could and should take some action.      We would alsono doubt have further detailed amendments to propose in actual wording of any resolution when its discussion in thelobbies and in Committee was under way.5. Please take early opportunity to explain to commonwealth authorities our attitude towards this question.We feel certain that Korean crisis has shown that some action on these lines is necessary if United nations is toplay any part in sphere of international peace and security.We feel also that it would be most regrettable if UnitedStates were to put forward proposals for which adequatesupport was hot forthcoming.      For this reason we feel thatit is most important that Commonwealth Governments should approach this idea sympathetically and if possible fromsame standpoint as our own.      In this way it should be easier to secure the modifications of&apos; those parts of american proposals which at present appear to us to beob ject i enable.6. We have suggested that parallel consultations should take place with Commonwealth delegations in new york.
