THIS   DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. October 1950 - \ e )n-i-vCONFIDENTIAL .; Copy No. 3 2CP. (50) 2493\st October, 1950 &apos;cabinet anglo-YEMENI DISCUSSIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for the colonies the Yemen is an extremely backward State whose rulers have hitherto almostentirely excluded all foreign influence as a matter of policy. It is a member ofthe United Nations and of the Arab League. Virtually its only interest to theUnited Kingdom lies in its proximity to the Aden Protectorate.2. Anglo-Yemeni relations are governed by the Treaty of Friendship of 1934,which has a duration of forty years. It proved impossible during its negotiationto settle the frontiers between the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate, and Article 3of the Treaty accordingly lays down that negotiations for a final settlement ofthis frontier shall be undertaken during the period of validity of the Treaty, andthat pending such negotiations each side should respect the status quo at the timeof signature. The Yemenis have, however, consistently refused a demarcation ofthis status quo line, because they lay claim, on vague historical grounds, to large areas within the Aden Protectorate, and fear to prejudice their claims by agreeing to the demarcation of even a provisional frontier line. We are advised that ourOwn claim in international law to these areas could probably be substantiated before an international tribunal.3. Both before and since the 1934 Treaty there have been intermittentincursions by Yemeni tribesmen, in some cases undoubtedly connived at by the yemen Government, into the Aden Protectorate. A particularly bad incidentoccurred in September 1949 at a place called Nagd Marqad, when the ActingGovernor of Aden was compelled, after due warning, to resort to air action to expel tribesmen who were attacking a customs post in Protectorate territory. TheYemeni Government complained strongly of this action and also of the actionof the Aden Government in permitting a survey by Petroleum Concessions, Ltd.,in an area round Shabwa, which lies within the Aden Protectorate but which they also claim. At one time they seemed likely to raise the matter in the security council but were persuaded by the other Arab States to suspend action pendingnegotiations with His Majesty&apos;s Government.4. Hitherto the Yemenis have never been willing to receive foreign envoysin their country, and it was arranged, when the 1934 Treaty was signed, that ourrelations with them should be conducted through the Governor of Aden. At onetime they agreed that the latter should be also appointed His Majesty&apos;s Ministerto the Yemen but subsequently withdrew their agreement. After the incidentreferred to in the previous paragraph they raised objection to dealing through theGovernor of Aden, and communications were virtually suspended.5.   In March 1950, as a result of unofficial conversations at the Foreign office with the Yemeni delegate to the United Nations, it was agreed that an official39567
Yemeni delegation should visit London for discussions with His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment on (a) The two incidents referred to in paragraph 3 above;(b) The manner of determination of the status quo frontier between the Yemen, and the Aden Protectorate;(c) The establishment of diplomatic relations; and(d) The improvement of commercial relations between the two countries.6. Discussions between the Yemeni delegation and a United Kingdom delega-tion, composed of Foreign Office and Colonial Office officials and the governor of Aden, accordingly began in London on 29th August and were concluded on10th October. The possibility of a final settlement was explored, but agreement was found to be impossible owing to the refusal of the Yemenis to abate their claims in the Aden Protectorate. Agreement was, however, reached, subject to approval by Governments, on a modus vivendi, of which a copy is attached. Itwill be seen that this covers:  (a) Establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the two countriesbefore the end of 1951.(b) His MajestyY Government to agree to co-operate with the Yemen oneconomic development, education, hygiene, &amp;c, and to provide expertson request to the best of their ability.(c) The establishment of a mixed frontier commission to examine on theground all the frontier areas at which incidents have occurred since1934 and to recommend solutions.(d) The two Governments to refrain from any action which may alter thestatus quo in the disputed areas pending the conclusion of the corn-mission^ work.\e) Acceptance of any findings of the commission not to prejudice any legalclaim which either Government may have in regard to a final settlementof the frontier question...  (/) Each Government to take appropriate measures in accordance with theirlaws to check subversive propaganda against the other.7. While it is uncertain whether the Yemen Government will accept thisagreement, or to what extent they will in practice carry out its terms in that event,the agreement, if confirmed by Governments, will have achieved the followingobjectives on our side:,- (i) It will have averted, during the period of the Frontier Commission^investigations (which are likely to be protracted), the likelihood of arecourse by the Yemenis to the United Nations.(ii) It will have secured the establishment of normal diplomatic representationbetween the two countries, which should facilitate the settling of frontier and other difficulties in the future.(iii) The Yemenis will have been induced to postpone their claim for a settle-ment of the two specific frontier incidents until the Frontier commission has decided on which side of the frontier the places in question lie,on which point the incidents themselves turn.(iv) The reference to co-operation in economic and other matters (para-graph 6 (b) above), which in effect means chiefly that the expertsattached to the British Middle East Office will in future be availableto assist the Yemen Government as they already do the Governmentsof all other Arab States, should facilitate the spread of British influence and British commercial interests in the Yemen.8.  We therefore recommend that this agreement should be approved.E. B,&apos; J. G,  &quot;31st October, 1950!
