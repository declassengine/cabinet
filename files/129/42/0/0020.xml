[HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYkS GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 2206TH OCTOBER, 1950NEW YORK MEETINGS(i) FOREIGN ministers CONFERENCES;   (ii) north atlantic COUNCIL;   AND (iii) UNITED nations general ASSEMBLYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will wish to have an account of the proceedings in new York last month at the meeting of the three Foreign Ministers ofFrance, the United States and the United Kingdom, and at the Council ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which I attended on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, and also to have a report on the opening stages ofthe Fifth Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations Organisa-tion, where I led the United Kingdom Delegation until my departure from new York on 29th September.2. The original intention had been that the tripartite meetingsshould be concluded in two and a half days, followed by a two-day meetingof the North Atlantic Council.     Ministers would then have been free to take part in the General Assembly of the United Nations opening on 19thSeptember.     In point of fact it was found necessary to extend both seriesof talks so that they overlapped with the proceedings of the United Nations..Objectives3. The objectives with which, in accordance with policy approved bythe Cabinet, I set out for this series of meetings may be summarised asfollows.     In the first place I hoped to make progress in building up an effective defence of Europe.     Secondly, I was anxious to profit by theopportunity    f contact with Mr. Acheson and other members of the UnitedStates Administration to make some contribution towards a solution of theproblem of American aid in respect of our defence programmes.     In thethird place I hoped to reach agreement with the United States and french governments on a series of further steps designed to liberalise therelations between the German Federal Government and the threeOccupying Powers.     And, finally, I wished to come to an understanding with the United States Government, before the opening of the united nations General Assembly, on a number of issues, particularly thoseconnected with the Far East and the relations of the Western Powers withthe Chinese People&apos;s Government.Defence of Europe4. In the field of European defence His Majesty&apos;s Government hadalready received, before I left the United Kingdom, an intimation of theimportant proposals which were to be put forward by Mr. Acheson at the copy NO.32CABINET

0 0tripartite meetings and the meeting of the North Atlantic Council.These proposals provided for the establishment of an integrated north atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) force in Europe under a supreme commander served by an integrated staff;   the despatch of american troops to Europe;   American financial assistance for the rearmamentprogrammes of North Atlantic Treaty countries;   and the participation of German units under conditions to be determined.     We for our part, inaccordance with policy approved by the Defence Committee on 1stSeptember, 1950 (D.O.(50) 17th Meeting, Minute 2), had certain suggestions to make as to the re-organisation of N.A.T.O. and the immediate appoint-ment of a Supreme Commander for N.A.T.O. collective forces.     It soonbecame clear, however, that the question of German rearmament and the participation of German units in the integrated force was going to causedifficulties.     The United States maintained that agreement on this point was an essential feature of their whole plan.    After referring to LondonI was authorised by the Cabinet (CM.(50) 59th Conclusions, Minute 1) toagree on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to German participation,subject to certain conditions;   and the principle was acceptable to all othermembers of the North Atlantic Treaty except France.     The French Govern-ment were, however, unable to agree, even in principle to the rearmamentof Western Germany and the eventual participation of German units in theproposed integrated force.     I was glad to have the assistance of theMinister of Defence in the series of meetings,,between the three foreign and the three Defence Ministers specially called in an attempt to narrowthe difference between the United States and French views on this question.In the event, however, the French Government maintaining their opposition,agreement was limited to measures for strengthening the West Germanpolice force, labour units, etci     I am submitting in a separate paper(CiPi(50) 223) a fuller account of the discussions on defence, both in the tripartite and North Atlantic Council meetings, including the question ofGerman participation.United Kingdom defence programmes5. Under my general direction British experts continued discussions with their United States opposite numbers with a view to finding methods ofproviding the United States aid necessary for high priority military produc-tion, on which His Majesty1 s Government had committed themselves to spend a second tranche of  100 millions, and for our three-year programme which involves an expenditure on defence of  3,600 millions.     these negotiations are still in progress but I think that my colleagues can be assured that the United States Administration have an understanding of our difficulties and are anxious to co-operate in finding a solution.6. I should also record that, as a result of a frank exchange of views in the course of the tripartite talks, I reached agreement with Mr. Achesonon a formula which should considerably ease the handling of the vexedquestion of East-West trade.Relations between the Occupying Powers and the German Federal government. In a.ddition to the agreement regarding the strengthening of theWest German, police, to which I have already&apos;dy referred, satisfactory progress was made with the French and Americans on a wide range of other Germanquestions arising from the previous tripartite talks in May,     These were mainly connected with the relationship of the Occupying Powers with theFederal Government, and the three High Commissioners, who attended theNew York meetings, returned to Germany with a set of agreed principles for their future course of action with the German Government.     A fulleraccount of these is given in a separate paper (CP.(50) 222).

8. A detailed account of my discussions in New York on Far Easternquestions is contained in a separate report (CP.(50) 221).     All I need sayhere is that decided progress was made towards an understanding withthe United States Government on the vexed problems of Chinese represen-tation in the United Nations and Formosa, while on Korea, which presentedno divergence of view between ourselves and the United States Government,the Americans readily tork up proposals which I advanced for the purposeof dealing with the future of the territory.9. With the full understanding of Mr. Acheson I cast my vote at theGeneral Assembly in favour of an Indian resolution to admit representa-tives of the Peking Government.    As anticipated, the resolution was defeated, but this gesture by His Majesty&apos;s Government evoked no hostile reaction in the United States, where subsequently there was a markedtendency, both in the Press and among informed opinion, to take a more reasonable attitude towards the Chinesequestion.10. It became urgent, with the turn of the military tide soon after myarrival in New York, to find a solution of the Korean problem which was likely to be acceptable in the United Nations.     In close consultation withthe United States and the Commonwealth I accordingly prepared a resolu-tion, the main purpose of which was to provide for the unification of Koreain accordance with the Assembly resolution of 1948 and to ignore the 3 8thParallel, which has never been internationally recognised as a frontier.This resolution, which is now before the Political Committee of the Assembly,was generally welcomed by friendly Powers&apos;, some of whom joined withHis Majesty&apos;s Government in sponsoring it, but, regrettably, it was not supported by India.11. Discussions are still proceeding on a resolution on Formosa, themain lines of which had been generally accepted by the United States and commonwealth Governments before I left New York.     This resolutioncontemplates the despatch of a United Nations Commission to Formosawhich would report to the United Nations Assembly after consultinginterested parties and Governments.     I am hopeful that the United StatesGovernment will not oppose the attendance of representatives of the peking Government at the Assembly when the resolution comes up fordiscussion.Proposals for strengthening United Nations procedures against aggression12. Of the subjects before the United Nations Assembly, other thanthose covered by the Tripartite Conferences, I need only mention theUnited States proposal for strengthening United Nations procedures forcountering aggression in cases where the Security Council is unable totake effective action.     The terms of the United States resolution on thissubject were already known to His Majesty&apos;s Government before,I left for new York, and my proposals in regard to them were approved by theCabinet (CM.(50) 55th Conclusions, Minute 5).     In my speech in thegeneral debate of the Assembly I welcomed the United States initiative inthis matter, while leaving it open to us to seek amendment of the resolu-tion where necessary.     I tried in my speech to underline the increasedstrength and responsibilities of the United Nations Organisation deriving from the new confidence placed in it by the world since the Koreanaggression, and I re-affirmed the intention, of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto continue to base their policy on the United Nations Charter.

Q 9o uConclusion13. I think that we can look back with some satisfaction on the seriesof meetings of which I have described the salient features.     I was particularly encouraged by the intimate and constructive way in whichwe were able to work on a number of important issues with our partners in the Commonwealth, including India.     The readiness of the UnitedStates to enter into a commitment to defend Europe in time of peacemarks a revolutionary step in their policy, while the evolution of theirthinking in regard to the Far East encourages me to believe that theUnited States are acquiring the wisdom as well as the might of a great power.     I should hesitate to guess how the Russian mind is working inview of the evident determination of the United States and the other freepeoples to defend themselves, but a circumspection, to which we havelately been unaccustomed, was evident in the proceedings of .Mr. Vyshinskiat Flushing Meadow.E.B.Foreign Office, S.W.1,6TH OCTOBER, 1950.
