THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1950CONFIDENTIAL Copy NO.     3 2CP. (50) 212 ^123rd September, 1950oCABINETSURRENDER OF WAR CRIMINALS AND TRAITORSMemorandum by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign affairs on 29th March, 1945^ His Majesty&apos;s Government gave an undertaking toall the Allied Governments represented on the United Nations War CrimesCommission* that they would be prepared to treat as an undesirable alien liableto deportation any alien against whom there was prima facie evidence that he wasa war criminal or had been guilty Of treachery involving active assistance to theenemy. It is considered that it would now be difficult to justify the use of the HomeSecretary&apos;s discretionary powers Of deportation for this purpose so long after theend of the war against Germany.Recommendation2. It is proposed that the undertaking of 29th March, 1945, should be withdrawn.Background3. In 1944 His Majesty&apos;s Government were asked to participate in aConvention for the surrender Of war criminals and other war offenders drafted bythe United Nations Commission for the Investigation of War Crimes. While HisMajesty&apos;s Government felt sympathy with the objects of the Convention, theprocedure which it envisaged would have given rise to a number of difficulties sofar as the United Kingdom was concerned and might well have required special legislation to give effect to it. It was thought that few war criminals would befound in the United Kingdom and that they would come to light soon after theend of the war. In these circumstances it was decided that it would be preferable to rely on the Home Secretary&apos;s powers Of deportation to secure the surrender ofany person in the United Kingdom against whom there was a prima facie case thathe was a war criminal or had been guilty of treachery involving active assistanceto the enemy. Accordingly on 29th March, 1945, the then Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, with the approval of the War Cabinet, sent to all Allied Govern-ments represented on the United Nations War Crimes Commission a Note statingthat, on the assumption that the process of the trial of war criminals and traitorswould be completed within a comparatively brief period, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere satisfied that, so far as the United Kingdom was concerned, the objects ofthe Convention could better be achieved by the use of existing powers than by thecreation of new ones which their formal adherence to the Convention would involve.The Note went on to explain that His Majesty&apos;s Government had power to repatriate by way of deportation any alien, if it was deemed to be conducive to thepublic good to do so, and gave an undertaking that they were prepared to treatas an undesirable alien liable to deportation any alien against whom there wasprima facie evidence that he was a war criminal or had been guilty of treacheryinvolving active assistance to the enemy.* I.e., those of Belgium, China, Czechoslovakia, Fiance, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,Norway, Poland, United States and Yugoslavia.39378
Argument4. The Home Secretary&apos;s discretionary powers of deportation are specificallylimited to cases in which he deems the removal of an alien conducive to the publicgood. It was recognised at the time when the Note was despatched that the useof these powers to remove an alien at the request of another Government was opento challenge, but it was agreed that no difficulty was likely to arise in the period immediately after the end of the war. In fact no case has occurred in which ithas proved necessary to use deportation to give effect to the undertaking.Parliamentary and public opinion has been critical of the trial of war criminalslong after the end of hostilities, and it is considered that the time has long passedwhen it would have been possible to justify, as conducive to the public good ofthis country, the deportation of an alien at the request of a foreign Governmentsolely on the grounds that there appeared to be a prima facie case that he was awar criminal or had been guilty of treachery involving active assistance to theenemy. The fact that the powers of deportation have never been exercised forthis purpose would mean that such a use of them now could not be defended asthe continuance of an existing practice.5. As regards the Governments to whom the Note was addressed, the termsof the Note made it clear that it was envisaged that trials of war criminals andtraitors should be completed within a comparatively brief period, and that it wason the assumption that any requests for the surrender of such persons would bemade within a comparatively brief period that the undertaking to deport wasgiven. The withdrawal of the Note at this date should not therefore lay HisMajesty&apos;s Government open to any charge of having contravened the undertaking given in the Note. His Majesty&apos;s Government were a party to the MoscowDeclaration on war criminals of November 1943, in which the principle was laiddown that German war criminals implicated in atrocities should be sent backto the countries in which their crimes were committed in order that they might be tried and punished according to the laws of those liberated countries. By now,however, His Majesty&apos;s Government can, it is thought, be held to have dischargedtheir obligations as a party to the Moscow Declaration.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government have not been a party to any similar inter-national agreement or declaration concerning traitors except in regard to yugoslavia. Under the Bled Agreement of 8th September, 1947, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment undertook to surrender all Yugoslav nationals in their power against whom the Yugoslav Government established a prima facie case of active andwilful collaboration with the Axis Powers. On 26th July, 1948, by which time allcases of alleged Yugoslav traitors found on British-controlled territory had been examined, the Yugoslav Government were informed that His Majesty&apos;s government considered that their obligations had been discharged to the best of their ability and that in the future they were prepared to consider the cases of 19 personsonly, should these happen to be found on British-controlled territory. While theattitude of the Yugoslav Government towards these 19 traitors has probably not altered, it is not considered likely that they would react strongly against any decision to withdraw our undertaking to hand these persons over in the unlikely event of their being found in the United Kingdom.7. The surrender of traitors from the British Zone of Germany has alreadybeen discontinued. On 16th January, 1949, the Military Governor announcedthat he would accept no further applications as from 1st March, 1949. this announcement led to a strong protest on the part of the Belgian Governmentand a somewhat half-hearted representation on the part of the French Government,but was elsewhere received without comment, even though it might have been expected that, of the collaborators with the Nazi Powers who had left their own countries, a large proportion would have made their way to Germany. since then 18 months have elapsed, the trials of persons accused of treachery areinfrequent in France, and it is probable that Belgian feeling on the subject oftraitors is becoming less&apos;strong. It consequently appears unlikely that the with-drawal of the Note would lead to appreciable, if any, protest in so far as traitorsgenerally are concerned.8. The United Kingdom High Commissioner in Germany is still willing toconsider the surrender of war criminals from the British Zone if applications areaccompanied by clear prima facie evidence of murder and by a satisfactoryexplanation of the failure to apply earlier. It is possible therefore that a complete
withdrawal of the Note might lead to protest based in part on the disparity of practice between this country and the British Zone of Germany. While, however,notorious war criminals are still from time to time discovered in the British zone of Germany, it is unlikely that such persons will be discovered in this country. Itdoes not therefore appear unreasonable to withdraw the Note despite the factthat the surrender of war criminals from the British Zone of Germany is continuing.It has also to be taken into account that among the Governments which are stillconducting war crimes trials the Belgian, French and Netherlands governments have indicated that they expect to conclude these trials in the course of this year.It would therefore appear on balance that there is no objection to the withdrawalof the Note in so far as war criminals are concerned.conclusion. I accordingly suggest that a Note should be sent to the Governments towhom the Note of 29th March, 1945, was addressed, informing them of HisMajesty&apos;s Governments intention to withdraw, as from a specified date, the under-taking to surrender war criminals and traitors.H.Foreign Office, S.WA,23rd September, 1950.
