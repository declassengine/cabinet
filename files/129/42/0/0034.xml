,7/10 / C9CHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET32C.P.(50) 234 COPY NO17TH OCTOBER, 1950CABINETTHE YUGOSLAV ECONOMIC CRISISMemorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the President of the Board of trade the object of this paper is to propose measures for helping the yugoslav Government to overcome their present economic crisis.2.    The nature of the crisisYugoslavia emerged from the war weakened by death, destructionand disorganisation.    Rehabilitation had a good start with the help ofthe United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration;   then,in 1947, the Five Year Plan of industrialisation was announced.   The chieffeatures of this Plan were the great size of the total investment programme;the lack of common sense in the selection of the industrial projects, many ofwhich, while using up substantial resources, could not contributeappreciably to the strength of the Yugoslav economy;   and the utter disregardfor the need to earn foreign exchange to finance the resulting imports ofcapital goods or even of raw materials.As a result a general deficit in the balance of payments has developed.   This would have occurred even without the breach with theCominform,    which has aggravated it.   The deficit has been financed from foreign loans designed for assisting with long-term development.Some of these loans (including the  13 millions granted last year by theUnited Kingdom) were made in the context of long-term Trade agreements and on the understanding that repayment would be made out of increaseddeliveries of Yugoslav goods.   It seems virtually certain that by this means the Yugoslavs have in effect sold the same goods several times over.   thus the prospect of their covering this deficit next year, even with loans, seemsremote.Concentration on the more ambitious capital projects has moreovermeant that even the most ordinary consumer goods have not been available and this, coupled with inflation caused by excessive capital expenditure,together with the results of general administrative incompetence, hasalmost brought the economic machine to a standstill.The shortage of consumer goods has reacted on the productionof food.   The peasants have had no incentive to produce or to bring to market more than they are forced to do and fear of collectivisation hasadded to their recalcitrance.   On top of this has come one of the worstdroughts in recent experience.   The maize crop is expected to be 40%less than last year, the wheat crop 21% less, and the potato crop 31% less.

The sugar-beet harvest has been even worse and there was a bad one lastyear.    Even the peasants are in danger of going hungry and they havebeen killing off live-stock for fear of being unable to feed it.   Thereis also a serious lack of fats to which the failure of the sunflower seedcrop has contributed.    The Government have reduced the bread ration by10% and have taken whatever measures they can to encourage farmers to fulfil their allotted deliveries and to preserve live-stock.   But these measures are quite insufficient in themselves and all competent observers prediet that unless substantial food supplies are brought into the country intime there will be widespread starvation in the spring.3.   The political dangers of the crisisUnless a minimum standard of living can be assured and a further fall in production prevented, there is a danger that the peasants and towns-people will fail to respond any longer to measures of   force and persuasionand even that the regime&apos;s principal supporters in the Party, the armyand the police may be forced to go short.   There is already evidence thatminor officials and the rank and file of the Party are short of essentials.Although the people are politically disorganised and there appears to be norisk of a spontaneous revolt on any serious scale there is a real danger that any further deterioration in the situation would lead to a generaldisintegration in the machinery of the States   There is already some evidence of dissension among the leaders.    Brigadier MacLean, M.P.,who knows Tito better than anyone else from the West, found him inSeptember more preoccupied than he had ever appeared during the worstdays of the war;   Tito moreover told him that the Russians were trying tocreate trouble in the Party and even among his immediate associates inaddition to exploiting the general discontent.   Cominform broadcastshave been directed at Yugoslavia in increasing volume during the last fewweeks and the material miseries of the Yugoslav population have been afruitful theme for their propaganda.   His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador seesYugoslavia as &quot;drifting helplessly down stream between two fires&quot;, and reports it to be his impression that Government policy is already paralysedby inertia.   Though Tito&apos;s prestige is still high he finds him for the first timehesitant to exercise his authority and he predicts that unless the situationimproves the regime will be in danger of &quot;breaking up&quot;.   No one knowsthe strength of the Cominformist sympathisers inside Yugoslavia but thereare certainly many and there must even be a number in important positions.After his recent visit to Yugoslavia the Secretary of the Labour Partyexpressed the opinion that there was no possibility of the present regimebeing replaced either by a right-wing one or by a social democratic one and that if it foundered under the combined weight of economic difficulties and Cominform pressure there was no doubt that it could only be succeeded by a Cominformist regime.   No experienced observer would dispute thecorrectness of this judgment.4.   Consequences of a collapse of the regimeThe issue is therefore the price which it is worth paying to make sure that the present regime is not replaced by a Cominform regime.   Itwould be hard to over-estimate the gravity of such an event.    Therecapture of Yugoslavia by the Soviet Union would strike fresh fear into thehearts of the Italians, the French and the West Germans and by nourishingthe myth of the inevitability of an ultimate Soviet dominion over europe would do untold harm to the defence efforts of the Western Powers.The threat to Greece would at once be revived and it is at least open to doubt whether the Greeks would have the moral or material resources to

face another round of warfare.   The Yugoslav army, which is notnegligible in comparison with the armies of its neighbours, would be lost and the Russians would be able to dominate the Adriatic.    The chance of communist parties and fellow-travellers elsewhere being weaned fromtheir allegiance to Moscow by the example of Tito would be gone.5.    The immediate measures necessary to avert the danger of the regime collapsingIt follows from the analysis in paragraph 2 above that what isrequired is the immediate despatch to Yugoslavia of comparatively largequantities of food and consumer goods, a first-aid operation which would admittedly have little or no effect in curing the basic economic diseasebut which might at least prevent the patient from dying.    This is an expensive type of operation but the stake is sufficiently large to make it worth while.   An indication of the amount of foodstuffs likely to berequired if the operation is to be successful is given in paragraph 7(b) below6.    Resources at present available to the Yugoslavs for financingemergency importsOne of the results of the inflation in Yugoslavia is that foreignpayments are only balanced by means of credits.   The following is a listof the principal credits made available to them in the past twelve months:-(a) from the United Kingdom,(i)    8 millions medium-term credit now practically allcommitted for the purchase of machinery, etc. ,(ii)    5 millions short-term revolving credit, most of it committed;(b) from the United States,$55 millions from the Export-Import Bank (815 millions ofwhich is still unspent but only $2 millions of which the Yugoslavhave been allowed to spend on food - as a special exception to the rules of the Bank);(c) from the International Monetary Fund,$9 millions, all used;(d) from the International Bank,S&apos;2. 7 millions for the production of timber;(e) from the Federal German Republic (with the consent of the threeControl Powers),S&quot;3 5 millions for capital equipment;(f) miscellaneous overdraft facilities from Germany, Austria, Sweden,Holland, Belgium and elsewhere.They have in short virtually no resources available, with theexception of the $2 millions under (b), for financing emergency imports offood or consumer goods.

7.   Additional economic aid recently requested by the Yugoslavs(a) They asked us in July for a short-term credit of unspecifiedsize to buy consumer goods and for a long-term credit of  30 millions to buy capital goods (in addition to the credits extended to them under the 1949trade agreement and referred to in paragraph 6 above which are nearly allcommitted).   They have more recently asked us in particular to considerthe possibility of extending to them immediate credits for (i)    1  million to buy consumer goods, (ii)    ljr million and  1 million to complete analuminium plant and a zinc plant, and (iii)   at least  1^ million for timber-cutting and transport equipment.(b) At the beginning of October they sounded the United StatesGovernment about the possibility of an outright grant of $100 millions,$40 to $50 millions to be spent on raw materials and the remainder onpurchases of food and feeding-stuffs totalling approximately 460,000 tons(say 50 shiploads), made up as follows:-Item Tons Cost in DollarsEdible fats 40,000 10.4 millionMaize 100,000 7.0Wheat 50,000 4.26Vegetables and - 7.0RiceBeans 30,000 4.88     &quot;Sugar 35,000 6.0Oats 100,000 5.0Barley 50,000 3.0Fodder 50,000 2.5Seeds - 4-0       &quot;They did not include potatoes because they said they judged it best to try to obtain food of equivalent calorific&apos; value but of less bulk.    The state department understand that this is the overall food and feeding-stuffrequirement as calculated by the Yugoslavs and does not refer exclusively to their requirements from the dollar area.     They also assume that itwould cover the period until next harvest.     They are trying to find out,inter alia:  (i) the reason for the oats requirements, (ii) the nature of the requirement for seeds.     The Agricultural Attache at the United states embassy in Belgrade, who is the best qualified foreign observer for thispurpose, estimates their losses from, the drought at 580,000 metric tons ofwheat, 1,800,000 of maize, 157,000 of other coarse grains, 637,000 of potatoes, and 39,000 of sun-flower seeds and he thinks that if theirstandards of consumption are to be maintained it would be necessary to import not less than 500,000 of wheat and 250,000 tons of concentratedlivestock feed.     A comparison of these figures with the figures given inthe table above suggests that even if their request to the United StatesGovernment is met in full it would still be necessary for them to make asubstantial cut in consumption and that there would still be a very smallmargin of safety.(c)      They asked some months ago for a loan from the international bank and there is a reasonable prospect that before the end of the year theBank may grant them a loan of some $25 - $30 millions.     (His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have agreed co contribute to such a loan up to a maximum of

 1 million).     But it would not be expendable on food or consumer goodsnor would its benefits accrue for some time.(d) They have asked to be allowed to make a further drawing onthe International Monetary Fund of up to ST 5 millions.     Money obtainedfrom  this source could be spent on food.(e) They have been trying without success to negotiate loans from belgium and France.8.   American views and intentionsWe have been in continuous touch with the State Department inrecent weeks.     They now accept our analysis of the situation and itscauses and agree that large emergency shipments both of foodstuffs and consumer goods are urgently needed.     On the 11th October, Mr. Achesontold a Press conference that it would &quot;undoubtedly be necessary to sendfood supplies to Yugoslavia this autumn because of the drought&quot;.     Butsix to eight weeks might elapse from the time that any food shipmentswere loaded on the Eastern seaboard of North America until the time thefood was actually distributed in the interior of Yugoslavia and the americans have not yet been able to formulate any firm plans on thefinancial aspect of their contribution towards the first aid operation,They think that before any outright grant could be made to the Yugoslavsit would probably first have to be considered by Congress, who, even.ifthey agreed to it, would almost certainly wish to attach political stringsunacceptable to the Yugoslavs.     Moreover Congress would probably be unable to consider the question at all until early next year.     The Yugoslavscould hardly be expected to service any additional dollar credits and theExport-Import Bank probably have no powers similar to those containedin Section 2 of our Export Guarantees Act by which credits can in exceptional cases be made available on a political rather than a commercial basis,     Even if they were able to allow the Yugoslavs to spend on food thewhole of the unused ST 5 millions of the previous Export-Import loan (seeparagraph 6 above) this would only be a partial solution.     They may be willing to agree that the Yugoslavs should draw a further ST 5 millions from the International Monetary Fund. &apos;   All that can be said at present isthat the Americans are conscious of the requirements of the situation,that they are publicly committed to arranging shipment of foedstuffs to yugoslavia &quot;this autumn&quot; but that their plans for doing so are stillnebulous.9,   -The contribution which His Majesty&apos;s Government can makeThe more quickly shipments can begin the more effective theywill be.     If a few shipments of food and consumer goods can be made toreach Yugoslavia before winter they will do more to restore confidencethan much bigger quantities reaching Yugoslavia later.    Early shipments of consumer goods might even have a direct effect in discouraginghoarding on the part of the peasants and in stimulating winter sowing.Distribution problems will also be more serious during the winter.What is immediately wanted in short is food and consumer goods &quot;in the pipeline&quot;.If His Majesty&apos;s Government are able to make a contribution oftheir own at once it would for the above reasons be a pity to hold it backuntil American plans for their share of the operation were formulated indetail.     In our preliminary exchange of views with the Americans we made it clear that we could not procure or finance supplies of foodstuffs in the

1:40types and quantities necessary.     We indicated that our share of theoperation might be the provision of consumer goods such as areavailable for sterling.However, subsequent enquiries have shown that canned fish toa value of  1^ millions could be made available at short notice fromstocks which the Ministry of Food are ready to dispose of, whilequantities of dried fish, whalemeat to mash powder might alsobe purchased as &quot;emergency rations&quot; from private traders in the UnitedKingdom, to a value of perhaps a further  1 million.     If these items were acceptable to the Yugoslavs, it would be possible to allow them to buysome or all of the quantities available with a credit under Section 2 ofthe Export Guarantees Act*    Stocks of grain are insufficient at present toallow us to divert grain shipments from the United Kingdom to Yugoslavia,but Yugoslavia^ stated requirements of wheat (50,000 tons) could be met from Italy or France if sterling were available to her for the purpose, or if the French Government could be persuaded to join us in this operation(see paragraph 10).     Most of her needs of beans and rice, and possibly apart of her needs of edible fats and sugar, might also be bought fOrsterling.     The total value of the foodstuffs available for sterling at onceis understood to be about  6 millions altogether, and more might beavailable later, e. g. in the spring of 1951.In the case of consumer goods His Majesty&apos;s Government couldgrant the Yugoslavs the credit for which they have asked, i.e,  l million,with which they could immediately obtain supplies of surplus blankets,army clothing, boots and shoes etc. , from Government surplus stores,and could go shopping on the open market in the United Kingdom for such other things as hardware, textiles and pharmaceutical stores.     Up to one thousand tons of soap could also be made available from United Kingdomstocks.     Although His Majesty&apos;s Government might initially only grant the Yugoslavs a credit for consumer goods of   1 million, the figure which they themselves have mentioned, they should recognise that forany good to be done larger supplies of consumer goods might eventually be necessary.We therefore suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government inform the americans in confidence that they are prepared to offer as an immediatecontribution towards a joint Anglo-American first-aid operation creditsof the order of   5 millions.     This would leave the Americans to con-tribute not less than $&quot;40 millions towards the financing of the foodstuffsrequested by the Yugoslavs.     Since assistance on this scale is unlikely to prove sufficient both His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United StatesGovernment would probably have to make further contributions in thecourse of the next twelve months.1 0.   Other possible contributorsWe have asked the French Government whether they would helpbut have received a discouraging reply.     Neither we nor the americans have yet approached the Canadian or any other Government,     Both of usmight put fresh pressure on the French Government to contribute and ajoint approach could be made to the Canadian Government.11.   Long-term considerationsAlthough our immediate concern must be to alleviate the shortageof food and consumer goods during the next few months, we should not losesight of the fact that the basic cause of this shortage is the economic policy

of the Yugoslav Government.     If our proposed first-aid operation issuccessful and the Yugoslav Government manage to survive until next summer without disaster, there is every reason to suppose that unless they have in the meantime radically amended their economic policy bya drastic reorientation of their capital investment programme they willface the same basic economic situation again next year.     In order toprevent this we should, if possible, find means of persuading and helpingthem to put their economy1 on a sounder basis so that external aid canultimately be dispensed with.     There would be little chance of the Yugo-slavs consenting to curtail their cherished investment programme as acondition of the receipt of food and consumer goods and it would be dangerous to try to impose such a condition.     They have, however,frequently told us that they want technical assistance and it would be not unreasonable to suggest to them that one or two economic experts fromthis country should be allowed to go to Belgrade to enquire into their needs for technical assistance, to look into the zinc and aluminium projectsreferred to in paragraph 7 above, and incidentally to cast a general eyeover the distribution of the consumer goods and food received from us.Such a party of experts, if well chosen and skilfully led, might eventuallysucceed by persuasion and advice in inducing the Yugoslav Government torecast their general investment policy.     The Yugoslavs are probably more disposed to listen to British advice than, to American advice.1 2.   recommendations we accordingly recommend that, in an effort to avert a collapse of the Yugoslav regime which would have the most serious consequences for our defence and foreign policy, we should be authorised:-(a) to inform the United States Government in confidence that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are prepared to extend further credits of up to 5 millions to Yugoslavia for the purchase of consumer goods and food-stuffs in the types available for sterling, including possibly wheat, on the under standing that the United States Government will be responsible for financing and procuring the major part of the food supplies required tomake such a first aid operation a success;(b) as soon as we are satisfied beyond a peradventure that the UnitedStates Government are.both willing and able to finance and procure food supplies on this scale, to offer the Yugoslav Government a credit of  3millions for foodstuffs and consumer go^ds and any consequential require-ments (keeping  2 millions in reserve), subject to their agreeing (i) tonegotiate at once with British economic representatives in Belgrade on thebest methods of using the credit and distributing the goods obtained with it(ii) to give facilities to these representatives to discuss and examine theother requests for assistance addressed to us (see paragraph 7(a) above);(c) to join the Americans in making a fresh approach to the Frenchand in asking the Canadian Government to assist;but that:-(d) until the first steps have been taken to meet the immediate emer-gency and until we have further information about the Yugoslav economytheir other requests for long-term economic aid should not be granted.If further aid is proved to be necessary we would consult our colleagues again.E.B.H.W.17TH OCTOBER, 1950.
