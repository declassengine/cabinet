THIS   DOCUMENT IS  THE   PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October&apos; 1950SECRET Copy No. 3 2CP. (50) 23619th October, 1950CABINETTHE COUNCIL OF europe memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe purpose of this paper is to assess the situation that has arisen in theCouncil of Europe as a result of the recommendations adopted by the consultative assembly at its session of last August, and to put forward the line of policy that i hope to be authorised to adopt at the Rome meeting of the Committee of Ministersbeginning on 3rd November.2. Some of the recommendations which will be coming before the Ministersinvolve either outright amendments of the Statute of the Council or an increase inits functions and powers beyond the limit originally contemplated by the Statute.For this reason it is necessary that our general policy towards the Council shouldbe reviewed and our attitude to the individual proposals determined in a logicalmanner.The problem. There have always been two conflicting views of the nature and purposesof the Council of Europe. To the majority of the Governments which set it upthe Council of Europe was not an instrument for the immediate political unification of Europe, but part of the general material and moral build-up of which other aspectsare represented by the O.E.E.C., the Brussels Treaty and the North Atlantic Pact.Their object was merely, as the Preamble of the Statute puts it, to bring &quot; european states into closer association.&quot; They had no intention of conferring the powers ofa European executive upon the Committee of Ministers, still less on any bodyemanating from the Consultative Assembly. Nor had they any intention of allowing the Assembly to become a responsible parliament. The Committee ofMinisters was intended to be an organ of inter-governmental co-operation, coveringfields, and including countries, not dealt with by other organisations. The Consul-tative Assembly was intended to be a forum of opinion and a forcing-house of ideas,broadly representative of political tendencies in the countries concerned but not so closely bound to governmental policies as to be unable to discuss European problemsfrom a reasonably detached point of view.4. From the outset this conception has broken down. The idea of a european assembly had been launched by the European Movement and theAssembly has from the first been dominated by that organisation. The drivingforce behind the Assembly&apos;s actions has thus been an energetic and able pressuregroup dedicated to the objective of transforming the Consultative Assembly intoa European parliament and the Council as a whole into a European political authority. Secondly, the Consultative Assembly has tended naturally to consistlargely of enthusiasts for European federation. It is therefore biased in favour of federal solutions to an extent which wholly invalidates its claim to representEuropean opinion as a whole. In consequence, the Assembly has from the firstrefused to be content with a purely consultative role, and has attempted by every means to secure its transformation into a European parliament from which a european executive would derive authority.5. This tendency was apparent in the first session of the Consultative assembly and M. Spaak, in his letter transmitting the recommendations of that session to theCommmittee of Ministers, declared that the Assembly had shown that it regardedone of its aims and objects to be the establishment of a European political authority&quot; with limited functions but real powers.&quot; This phrase has become the text of thefederalist majority in the Consultative Assembly.39513 b
.6. A number of the member Governments, led by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, have made it clear that they do not accept this aim, and the result hasbeen a running conflict between the two organs of the Council. The Committeeof Ministers have been represented as a tyrannical and reactionary &quot; executive &quot;thwarting the wishes of a democratic and progressive &quot;legislature&quot; and standing in the way of the universal desire for federation. Various attempts to improve relations between the two organs, and notably the creation of a Joint committee with representatives from both, failed to eliminate the basic conflict of view and purpose between the responsible Ministers on the one hand and the non-responsibleand unelected Assembly on the other. The matter is further complicated by the unwillingness of certain Governments and particularly the French to take a firm line with the Assembly enthusiasts, or to apply a critical judgment to idealisticschemes. Thus, apart from the cleavage between the Committee of ministers and the Assembly, there is a latent cleavage within the Committee of Ministersbetween the Latin continental Powers, who favour European federation, and therest led by His Majesty&apos;s Government, who are very much more cautious.The 1950 Session of the Assembly7. At the recent session of the Assembly this conflict was greatly aggravated.Criticism of the Committee of Ministers was very strong and the Assembly adopted a series of recommendations on general affairs inspired by federalist ideas and seeking in various ways to amend or undermine the provisions of the Statute,to increase the authority of the Assembly and to endow the Council of Europewith new machinery and powers. (These are summarised at Annex A.) At thesame time, by a decision which is certainly not in accord with the intention of theStatute, the Assembly session was adjourned before it had run its full course and will be resumed on 17th November. This means that the Assembly will bemeeting again immediately after the next session of the Committee of Ministers.The Assembly&apos;s spokesmen have made it clear that they will regard the decisions taken by the Ministers on the Assembly&apos;s recommendations as a test of theMinisters&apos; &quot; sincerity &quot; towards the purposes of the Council of Europe, and theprime purpose of the adjourned session will be to denounce the attitude of theCommittee of Ministers if its decisions do not give satisfaction.8. In a letter (Annex B) of 4th September to the Chairman of the Committeethe President of the Assembly, M. Spaak, has expressed (in reasonably courteousterms this time) the &quot; extreme disappointment&quot; of the Assembly in the Reportof the Ministers to the 1950 Session, and has justified and explained the demand of the Assembly for certain revisions of the Statute. This letter specifically asksthat the Assembly be informed, before the opening of the second part of its present session, of the &quot; first positive decisions &quot; of the Committee of Ministers on these recommendations, &quot; decisions which it hopes will be of a favourable nature.&quot;9. Thus the Committee of Ministers at its meeting on 3rd November will be faced with the necessity of considering fundamental questions on the future role of the Council of Europe. It will be called upon in effect to decide whether, onthe one hand, to reject all the recommendations to which the Assembly attachmost importance and thus give to the Council of Europe a rebuff which it might very well not survive; or, on the other, to allow the institution to develop powersand to perform functions which go well beyond the intentions of the Statute.The General Policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government10. The line which I shall have to take in Rome must clearly conform to the basic policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government have accepetd hitherto and to whichwe must stick, of avoiding commitments in Europe which would affect our positionas the leading member of the Commonwealth, our special relationship with theUnited States and our responsibilities as the centre of the Sterling Area. We must therefore decline to accept limitations, in a purely European association, on our ability to take basic decisions of policy (including those of an economic character)on our own responsibility, and we cannot agree that any organs of the Councilof Europe to which we belong should acquire authority of a supra-nationalcharacter. I assume that my Cabinet colleagues will be in full agreement on thispoint.. 11. On the other hand, it would be very wrong, in the present state of moralein Europe, for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take up a position which obstructs the
endeavours of other European Powers to achieve closer unity. There has alwaysbeen a certain danger that a refusal by Great Britain to take a full part in themovement towards European unity might lead to the creation of a bloc of european powers inimicable to our interests, especially if Germany were to get control ofsuch a bloc. Traditionally, British policy has always been to prevent the formationof any such grouping on the Continent, but the emergence of the Soviet Union asan overriding threat to Europe has altered the basis on which this policy was founded. Subject to careful watch on the revival of German influence and power,I do not think it need any longer be regarded as necessary for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to work against the creation of close groupings, even of a federalcharacter, between Western European countries. Furthermore, such is the presentmaterial and moral weakness of countries such as France and Italy that they arein danger of losing the will to survive as separate independent nations; and itmight be fatal to the preservation of democracy in Western Europe if we wereopenly to discourage the conception of European unity which is refieced in theCouncil of Europe.12. For these reasons, I think we have to steer a course between becomingtoo deeply involved ourselves in European union on the one hand, and, on the other,standing in the way of greater continental cohesion. While, therefore, I admit thatthe Council of Europe has many features which are objectionable to us and isnot an institution in which Great Britain can ever find a wholly satisfactoryposition, we must nevertheless do what we can to prevent its collapse and to assistit to do useful work and to play a sensible part in the revival of Western Europe.The proposals which I set out below are designed to create conditions in whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government can continue to play a valuable role in the Council inits present limited form, while allowing other Governments, if they so wish, toenter into closer commitments with each other on specific subjects within the framework of the Council.Policy to be Pursued at the Committee of Ministers on 3rd November13. The ministers meeting in Rome cannot last more than two or three days,and it seems most improbable that agreement could be reached in so short a time on the Assembly&apos;s recommendations, more especially as our own attitude towardsamendments of the Statute is likely to be very much more negative than that ofsome other Governments. Moreover, it seemed to me that we ought noG to allow the Statute to be attacked piepemeal on the basis of the somewhat arbitraryrecommendations of the Assembly; and that if any departure from the Statutewere to take place, it should be on the basis of a full examination of all factors and very careful thought. I therefore had it in mind to suggest that, when theCommittee meets in Rome, it should defer consideration of those of the Assembly&apos;srecommendations which affect the Statute and should refer the whole question to a Committee of Experts, who might report between now and next summer onthe effectiveness of the Statute and on possible methods of improving it.14. At a meeting of Advisers of the Foreign Ministers held in Strasbourg on10th and 11th October, a proposal was put forward on behalf of Count Sforzawhich is very similar to this except that, instead of a Committee of Experts,Count Sforza proposes a &apos;; Conference &quot; at Ambassadorial level to examine allproposals for the amendment of the Statute and to make recommendationsdesigned to satisfy those members who wish to see the powers and functions ofthe Council of Europe extended. This proposal met with a good deal of support from the representatives of the other Foreign Ministers. It will come before theCommittee of Ministers on 3rd November as an Italian proposal.15. There is likely to be a strong leaning in the Committee of Ministers infavour of some solution of this kind which will postpone the moment when a directreply has to be given to the Assembly&apos;s constitutional proposals. I think, however,that we should press for a Committee of Experts, answerable to the Committee ofMinisters, rather than a Conference at Ambassadorial level called by the Govern-ments. Not only would a committee called by the Committee of Ministers verypossibly prove more acceptable to the Assembly, in that it would not appear as ifthe committee was abandoning the question to the individual Governments, but itwould be easier to frame satisfactory terms of reference for a committee of thiskind. The summoning of a Conference could hardly fail to imply that the principleof amending the Statute had been approved,: whereas the committee could be given
terms of reference limited to examining the recommendations of the Assembly andreviewing the Statute, in order to see whether, in the light of these recommendations and the experience of the last two years, any changes were required.16. However, before we agree to an arrangement of this kind, it is essentialthat we should leave the other Governments under no misapprehension as to thespirit in which we do so. Certain Governments--and in particular the FrenchGovernment will endeavour to represent any decision to hold a conference toexamine the Statute as an admission in principle that the Statute should be sub-stantially revised in the direction desired by the Assembly. I must be prepared atthe Rome meeting to state clearly the very strong reserves which I am sure HisMajesty&apos;s Government must make in regard to this principle. I desire to have theconcurrence of my colleagues in these reserves, which I formulate as follows:  The Reserves of His Majesty&apos;s Government17. (1) In accordance with the policy outlined in paragraph 10 above, we mustreject the Assembly&apos;s recommendation for an amendment of Article 15to make decisions of the Committee of Ministers mandatory uponGovernments.(2) As a corollary to the above we should not be prepared to agree at thisstage to the extension of the powers of the Assembly from its presentpurely consultative role to that of a legislative Assembly or european parliament. The experience of the composition and conduct of theAssembly during the last two years strongly supports this reserve.(3) Subject to these main conditions, however, we should not wish to standin the way of other Governments who may desire to form closer associa-tions for specific purposes within the framework of the Council ofEurope. Therefore we should be willing to accept the principle of&quot; partial agreements &quot; as reflected in the Assembly&apos;s RecommendationNo. 3.(4) In particular, we should not oppose the creation of &quot; specialised agencies &quot;or &quot; special committees &quot; (Assembly Recommendations Nos. I and 4)amongst groups of member Governments. Although His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would not be able to join such agencies if they possessed&quot; powers not provided for by the Statute of the Council,&quot; we shouldbe ready to consider when the time came the possibility of beingassociated in an appropriate manner with the work of such agencies.(This would be parallel to our attitude towards the Schuman Plan.)(5) We must take a firm line regarding the Assembly&apos;s Recommendation fora European Army with a European Minister of Defence. This Recom-mendation is clearly ultra vires of the Assembly under the terms ofthe Statute, and the Ministers should decline to make any response onthe substance of the proposal. If other- Ministers support the Assembly&apos;sargument that they are entitled to discuss &quot; the political aspects ofdefence&quot; we should say that this is an interpretation (and in ouropinion a wrong one) of the Statute which can only be considered bythe proposed Committee on the Statute. We should be prepared toexpound the very grave reasons against allowing defence to become amatter for treatment in the Council of Europe.Compensatory steps to offset the effect of our reserves18. The above would be the conditions upon which we should agree to take part in a Conference to examine and perhaps amend the Statute. Certain otherGovernments, and especially the Scandinavians, Greeks and Turks, are likely towant to make similar conditions, while others (in particular the French and italians) will regard such reserves as a fatal obstacle to the further growth ofEuropean unity under the Council of Europe. I think that if we are going to take this firm line (as we certainly must) we ought at the same time to do what wecan to show that we are not abandoning the whole conception of the Council ofEurope and that we are not hostile to the Assembly as such. There would, in my view, be serious danger in another season of frustration and lack of achievementon the part of the Council of Europe. It is certainly not in the interest of HisMajesty&apos;s Government that this experiment, on which such hopes have been placedespecially on the Continent, should break up in disorder and recrimination.
19.   The following are the points which I have in mind:  (1) We must sign the Convention of Human Rights, which is the only positiveachievement of the Council of Europe to date. The compromise reached on this within the Committee of Ministers was agreed to in order to attain our adherence, and a retreat on our part at this stage would put us in a most embarrassing position. We must, of course, reject the amendments which the Assembly have proposed, but I have reason tothink that if we are firm on these we shall not have difficulty in gettingagreement to sign the text as approved at the last Committee ofMinisters.(2) We must endeavour to find useful work for the Council of Europe. Weshould not discourage the proposals of the Assembly for a EuropeanRefugee Service and we should adopt generally as forthcoming an attitude as possible in such matters as Social Security, Full employment and the extension to the Council of Europe of the Cultural Work ofthe Brussels Treaty. We should try to make greater use of the Com-mittee of Ministers and its subordinate Committee of Experts. I shouldbe grateful if my Cabinet colleagues could make enquiries through their departments as to whether there are any topics requiring Europeaninternational discussion which could reasonably be handled by govern-mental committees under the Council of Europe. I am making asimilar enquiry in the Foreign Office.(3) In pursuance of our doctrine that the Assembly must remain purely consul-tative, we should in future be less concerned about its debates and decisions and should avoid placing ourselves in the position of trying to control it. To this end I recommend tha: we should not include Minis-ters of His Majesty&apos;s Government in future United Kingdom delegations to the Assembly, and that we should consider including a certainnumber of non-politicians in our delegation.Conclusion20. If the Cabinet approve the policy outlined in this paper, T would proposeto communicate it in outline to the other Governments before the Rome meetingof the Committee of Ministers, in order that they may be clear in advance as tothe attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government. I think also that it would be necessaryfor us, at the time of the Committee&apos;s meeting, to explain our attitude clearly to public opinion in this country and on the Continent, in order that there may beno misunderstanding regarding the position prior to the calling of the proposed conference.E.

Recommendations requiring the amendment of the Statute or the endowmentof the Council of Europe with powers not provided for in the Statute1. Creation of Specialised Authorities. (Recommendation 1)This recommendation proposes the creation of &quot; specialised authorities &quot; withinthe framework of the Council of Europe, competent in the political, economic,social, legal and cultural fields. The organs of administration and control of these authorities should be integrated with those of the Council of Europe. Examples ofsuch &quot; specialised authorities &quot; are the supra-national authority for coal and steelwhich is to be set up under the Schuman Plan and authorities for the control ofEuropean Transport and Agricultural Marketing on which specific recommenda-tions have been adopted by the Consultative Assembly.These authorities would be open to all member States of the Council of Europe,but accession would not be obligatory.
This recommendation has to be read with Assembly resolution No. 11 whichinterprets the phrase &quot; political field&quot; as including the political aspect of defence problems.2. Addition of a new Article 7 (a) to the Rules of Procedure of the Committee ofMinisters. (Recommendation 3)This recommendation proposes the addition of an Article 7 (a) to the Com-mittee&apos;s Rules of Procedure making it possible for members to vote in favour of anagreement in principle while reserving the right not to apply it immediately either in whole or in part. The recommendation seeks to circumvent the unanimity rule of the Committee of Ministers without an actual amendment of the Statute.3. Adoption of an Additional Protocol to the Statute. (Recommendation 4)This recommendation proposes the amendment of the Statute by the additionof a protocol whereby, by special conventions concluded between the member states or between some of them, powers not provided for by the Statute of the Council maybe conferred on special Committees of the Committee of Ministers or the Consulta-tive Assembly. This recommendation supplements the previous one; they are bothintended to facilitate &quot; partial agreements &quot; within the framework of the Council ofEurope. This recommendation would also provide a method of linking the&quot; specialised authorities &quot; envisaged by the first recommendation with the Councilof Europe.4. European Army. (Recommendation 5)This recommendation proposes the creation of a unified European Armyunder the authority of a European Minister of Defence, subject to democraticEuropean control and acting in co-operation with the United States and Canada.5. Amendment of Article 15 of the Statute. (Recommendation 10)The recommendation proposes that Article 15 of the Statute of the council should be so amended that the conclusions of the Committee of Ministers maycarry the weight of decisions reached by mutual agreement between member statesand will be mandatory on the governments of the member states.II. -Recommendations on Specific Subjects6. International Authority for the Control of Coal and Steel (Schuman Plan). (Recommendation 6)The recommendation urges that a renewed effort be made to find a basis for agreement which will enable all the principal coal and steel producing countries of Europe to participate fully in the Schuman Plan and that any parliamentaryauthority created under the Plan should be composed of representatives in the consultative Assembly of the participating countries. These representatives wouldbe called upon to submit periodical reports to the Consultative Assembly.7. Human Rights. (Recommendation 24)The recommendation approves the draft Convention on Human Rightssubmitted by the Commitee of Ministers to the Consultative Assembly, butproposes certain amendments.  These are:  (1) The addition of a Preamble to the Statute.(2) The insertion of articles guaranteeing the rights of private property, theright of parents to control the religious and moral education of their children and the right to free elections.(3) The amendment of Article 25 dealing with the right of individual petition.As drafted by the Committee of Ministers the Article provided thatstates signatory to the Convention should accept the jurisdiction of theproposed Commission of Enquiry by contracting in. As revised by theAssembly the Article would oblige states unwilling to accept the Corn-mission^ jurisdiction to contract out.    .(.4) The amendment of Article 56 to reduce the number of states whoseaccession is required for the setting up of the . International Court; from nine to eight.(5) The deletion of the Colonial Application Clause.
8. Full Employment. (Recommendation 25)The recommendation proposes that member governments should announce tothe Consultative Assembly not later than 1st November, 1950, full employment&quot; targets &quot; and reports on the general domestic policy they propose to follow for achieving full employment and economic stability. The Secretariat-General in co-operation with the International Labour Office and the Economic Commission for europe should study these targets and reports to elucidate the progress achieved by each member government.9. European Code of Social Security. (Recommendation 28)This recommendation proposes the establishment of a European Code of social Security which should be prepared as a convention by the Council of europe in collaboration with the I.L.O. The convention should be adopted by a EuropeanLabour Conference convened according to the rules of the I.L.O. on the basis of athree-fold representation of government, employer, and workers.10. Refugees. (Recommendation 30)The recommendation urges member governments to take all necessary measuresto improve the lot of refugees and proposes that a provisional service should be setup immediately within the framework of the Council of Europe for the study of theproblems involved in the legal position of refugees and to satisfy the most pressingneeds of refugees of all categories particularly those who do not receive assistancefrom any international organisation.ANNEX copy of a Letter from the President of the Consultative Assembly to theChairman of the Committee of Ministers4th September, 1950Mr. Chairman,I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the Recommendations adoptedby the Assembly during the first part of its Ordinary Session of 1950.The Assembly has instructed me to let you know its feelings concerning theReport and the Message which the Committee of Ministers addressed to it on the eve of the opening of the Session. It noted with pleasure that the Committee ofMinisters supplemented its Report by the political comments contained in the message.It has taken note of the decisions taken during recent months with a view to the unification of Europe, as set forth in the Message. It hopes that they will be theforerunners of further specific measures. In particular, it warmly welcomes theinitiative of the French Government.The Assembly has recognised readily that account must be taken of these results in judging the actions of the Committee of Ministers, which is the repre-sentative organ of the Governments. But it emphasises that this very fact bearswitness to the imperative necessity of effecting a closer co-ordination between theexisting inter-Governmental organisations. In particular it draws the attention ofthe Committee of Ministers to the Recommendations which it has adopted on thismatter.The Assembly has welcomed the statements made by the Chairman of the Com-mittee of Ministers and M. Schuman. It has requested me warmly to thank them.It regrets, however, that the Representative of the Committee of Ministers shouldnot have been in a position to reply to the questions asked by the various speakers.The Assembly, indeed, considers it essential for the progress of its work andfor the development of the Council of Europe as a whole, that both Representativesof the Committee of Ministers and Ministers of the Member States should take an active part in its Debates.The Assembly thanks the Committee of Ministers for giving it the opportunityof oroclaiming its agreement with the action taken by the Security Council of theUnited Nations and for thus enabling European public opinion to express itself onthe gravest problems which are now causing such deep anxiety in our countries.The Assembly declares that it is only by the closest liaison between theGovernments of democratic Europe whose mouthpiece is the Committee of
Ministers and the European Pariiaments of which the Assembly is the mostqualified representative, that it will become possible for the people to be fullyassociated with the grave measures which have now to be taken by the free Statesof Europe.It is these very considerations that have caused the Assembly to regard theconclusions of the Statutory Report of the Committee of Ministers as extremelydisappointing.The main part of the decisions taken by the Committee has only been concernedwith questions of internal organisation or of procedure. With the exception of theConvention on Human Rights, the few Recommendations adopted by the Com-mittee have only been concerned with secondary questions.It would appear that this lack of effective liaison between the Committee ofMinisters and the Assembly has prevented the Committee of Ministers from grasp-ing the immense importance that the Assembly attaches to consideration being givento its Recommendations. Whatever may have been said, the Assembly is composedof politicians, who fully recognise the gravity of their responsibilities. Conse-quently, the Assembly regrets that the Committee of Ministers should not have seenits way to make fitting use of an organisation that came into being as it undoubt-edly did under the pressure of public opinion in the member states, and which hasreceived the approbation of the Parliaments of those countries.Faced with the hesitancy of the Committee, the Assembly has endeavoured to propose modifications or interpretations of the Statute, which, in its opinion, wouldbe calculated to improve the functioning of that instrument. But the Assembly didnot seek to substitute itself for the executive power. Its role with regard to ques-tions affecting European union is to formulate proposals of a general character andto define the principles of the political action which it recommends to the Govern-ments. It will then appertain to these Governments to work out detailed plans ofaction capable of being put into effect.On the other hand, the Assembly, which is the expression of European publicopinion, is justified in asking that the Committee of Ministers should provide themwith definite plans, largely taking into account the Recommendations passed by theAssembly. The Assembly is ready to give its complete support to such plans, inconformity with its mission, and with the hopes that the peoples have placed in it.It is in this spirit that the Assembly has sought, during the present Session, to confirm and supplement its previous Recommendations. It expresses the firm hopethat the Committee of Ministers will acquaint it, before the opening of the secondperiod of its present Session, of its first positive decisions on these Recommenda-tions, decisions which, it hopes, will be of a favourable nature.I shall not fail to let Your Excellency know in due course, on behalf of theStanding Committee, of the order of priority which the Committee recommends forthe examination which you will be required to make of the said Recommendations.Finallv, the Assembly which, in deliberately shortening the first part of itsOrdinary Session, reserved the right to complete it, probably during the last week of November, would very much like, before starting its work again, to know of theaction taken by the Committee of Ministers on its Recommendations and particu-larly those referred to in the preceding paragraph.I am, Mr. Chairman,with great truth and respect,Your humble and obedient Servant,P. H. SPAAKHis Excellency Mr. Sean MacBride,Minister for External Affairs,Chairman of the Committee of ministers of the Council of Europe,Department of External Affairs, Dublin.
