THIS   DOCUMENT IS  THE   PROPERTY  OF  HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1950.SECRET Copy No. 32CP. (50) 25026th October, 1950CABINETPERSIA:  LABOUR SITUATION IN THE OIL AREASMemorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Minister ofLabour and National Service and Minister of Fuel and power at their meeting on 1st August (D.O. (50) 16th Meeting, Minute 1 (4)) theDefence Committee invited the Minister of State and the Minister of Fuel and power to arrange for a general discussion to be held with the Anglo-Iranian oil company on the political and labour situation in Persia and on methods of removing the causes of labour unrest. The Committee also invited the Minister ofLabour to obtain a report from the Labour Attache in Persia on the present labour situation. The labour situation in Persia has now been discussed interdepart-mentally and with representatives of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and wecirculate for the information of our colleagues a memorandum on the issues raisedby the Defence Committee. Attached to this memorandum is the report of theLabour Attache in Persia on the present labour situation (Annex A) and an extractfrom an earlier report by the Attache on the housing situation in Abadan andthe oilfields (Annex B).general. The Company&apos;s general position in Persia to-day is overshadowed by theproblem of the Supplemental Oil Agreement between the Persian Government andthe Company, signed in July 1949 but still unratified. Ratification of thisAgreement would secure for the Persians not merely a large lump sum (approxi-mately  38 million) in respect of back payments, but an increase in annualroyalties from about  15-7 million to about  30 million (on the basis of estimated1950 production). Only the Agreement can provide Persia with the funds requiredfor her Seven-Year Plan of development. Without such a development programme,calculated to raise the standards of the masses now living in poverty, ignorance anddisease, the pro-Soviet Tudeh Party might well regain the ascendancy which itachieved in 1946, and would certainly continue to find fruitful ground for agita-tion and for fomenting discontent.3. The delay in ratifying the Agreement has been due to opposition by a small body of nationalistic members of the Majlis, and to the unwillingness of succes-sive Prime Ministers to sponsor a document produced by a predecessor. Both these factors have caused each Government of the day to demand additional concessions.The Company&apos;s attitude towards these demands is that they are not prepared toconsider fundamental modifications in the terms of the Agreement, which is undoubtedly fair, and even generous ; but they have never wished to close the door on discussions with the Persian Government and, in fact, confidential negotia-tions between the Persian Prime Minister and the Company&apos;s Chief representative in Tehran are now in progress. Although it is stated in paragraph 10of Appendix A that fresh criticism of the Agreement had helped the Tudehcampaign in the oil areas, there is no reason to believe that the oil workers as a39566 - - b
whole have yet shown any great interest in the fate of the Agreement. But a deadlock or complete breakdown of the negotiations would create a situation whichmight become critical and would afford fresh opportunities for agitation.4. Since military government law is of great importance for the maintenanceof tranquillity in the oil areas, any troubles which affect the loyalty of the army would tend to weaken law and order in those areas, and hence interfere with oil production; but there is at present no evidence of widespread disaffection in thearmy. Beyond this factor, it is not necessarily true that trouble in other partsof Persia would affect the oil areas. In any case the Company can exert little or no direct influence on general policies designed to forestall labour unrest in Persiaas a whole. Attention may therefore be concentrated on matters of specific concern to the oil workers.Labour Situation and Conditions of Work5. There is no doubt about the good record and standards of the Companyas an employer of Labour. Impartial observers, including experts from the Inter-national Labour Office, have recently confirmed this. The many developments ofrecent years which are of particular importance in improving labour relations andconditions of work include the foundation of an industrial relations department,whose staff include a considerable number of Persians; the establishment of somefifty-five to sixty joint consultative committees; action to control cost of livingby subsidising necessaries and opening a co-operative store; increased provisionof workers&apos; houses and clubs, and expanded health and educational services.6. The joint consultative committees consist of Company and workers&apos;representatives; the latter are elected. The aim of the scheme, which ha.s worked well on the whole, is not only to provide machinery for remedying grievances, butalso to educate Persians in the formulation of collective views, and there is hopethat a healthy form of unionism will emerge from it. The joint committees are,in fact, more effective in promoting the interest of the workers than the CentralUnion of Oil Workers itself. Although the Tudeh Party has a number of members in the oil areas, at the moment there is no sign of overt activity on their part, andthey signally failed to cause any trouble over the dismissal by the Company ofthe oil workers&apos; leader in Abadan who had been trying to stir up unrest.7., The Company has a good record on wages, and there has been no recenttrouble on this score. It has treated the statutory minimum Wage of 40 rials aday as a real minimum and the great majority of Abadan unskilled workers nowreceive 42 rials a day and upwards; 90 per cent, of the manual workers in Abadanhave wage rates above 42 rials a day, and 50 per cent, of all manual workersreceive wage rates ranging from 62 rials a day to 136 rials a day. Thanks to theCompany&apos;s supply to its workers of various essential commodities at favourable(in some cases subsidised) prices, the cost of living, subject elsewhere in Persia to substantial fluctuations, has remained very steady for Company employees.Housing8. Apart from political influences the only cause of unrest which appears atall likely is the shortage of houses. By the end of last March only 5,500 Persianworkers out of 30,500 were housed by the Company in Abadan, and only about35 per cent, in the field areas. These figures do not take account of employeesliving with occupiers, either as lodgers or dependants. It is also to be borne in mind that a substantial number of workers (particularly unskilled workers) returnfrequently to their own tribal or home areas, and that the number of tlose whoare permanently employed in Abadan and field areas is much less than the total labour force at any given time. In order to ameliorate hardship caused by highrents charged by Persian landlords, the Company provides a rent allowance to workers not living in Company houses.9. The rapid increase in the production of oil has resulted in a corresponding increase in man-power, which commenced in August 1941 and which continuesto remain at a high level. This, allied to the fact that the Company&apos;s building programme was largely suspended during the war years, has left a back log ofbuilding, which the Company are making strenuous efforts to overtake. Since theend of the war there have been difficulties connected with the procurement of
building materials, a large part of which has had to be transported from abroad and the Company has also had to undertake construction work for social amenities,such as water supply and sanitation, in addition to expansion of production andrefining facilities.10. The Company, claim that the cost of all housing in Persia is very high;a Worker&apos;s two-roomed house costs  2,100; a worker&apos;s three-roomed house  2,800;and a small house for an executive in the oilfields  14,000. The policy of theCompany is to build houses of good quality and they are unwilling to build workers&apos;quarters which would later become slums, or build houses of mud or other con-structions which would merely invite criticism from many quarters. This policy has naturally tended to limit the building programme.11. A new and satisfactory type of house for the general body of workers,which can be built more quickly than the earlier models, has now been developed.For the present year a total of 1,700 bouses are projected, of which 875 will bein Abadan. To-day the Company is concentrating on building houses for the worker (especially the skilled worker) more than ever before, and there is said tobe less complaint about housing than there was a year ago. The Company wouldlike the Abadan Municipality to take more responsibility for housing as well as forother public services, and have offered to assist the Municipality with materials and technical advice.12. A certain amount of discontent was caused early this year by the massdismissal of some 500 workers. However, provided production is maintained, theCompany do not think that it will be necessary to dismiss many men in the nextyear or two, and they do not expect further trouble under this head.13.   Conclusions(i) The labour situation in the oil industry is better than it has been since theend of the war.(ii) There can, however, be no absolute safeguard against labour agitationwhich may be based on extraneous political factors, and may firstdevelop outside the oil industry.(iii) The only cause of renewed unrest which appears at all likely to arise fromthe Company&apos;s social and labour policies relates to the shortage ofhouses for Persian workers. In this connexion the Company recognisethat it is important that they should do everything possible to acceleratetheir building programme.(iv) Outside the oil industry, there are many causes for discontent amongstthe workers and peasants Which can only be removed by economic development, coupled with enlightened social reforms of the kind whichthe British and American Governments have been pressing upon theGovernment of Persia. While these lag behind, the possibility will always remain of widespread unrest being fomented in which the oil-workers would.be bound to be involved.E. B.G. A. I.P. J. N-B.26?/? October, 1950.39566
ANNEX A! Notes On the Labour Situation in Persia ;introduction. Total population of Iran as estimated at March 1950 was roughly18 million, of which roughly 9 million were males. Urban population was about,600,000, of which 1,800,000 were males. The rural population was given as14,700,000, of which 7,300,000 were males. These figures are, in fact, estimates and the total may be 2 to 3 million more. Population by nationalities is unknown,but there are not more than a few thousand European foreigners in Tehran, and about 3,000 British and 1,500 Indians employed with the Oil Company inKhuzistan.Working Population2. Working population by main industrial groups is divided (roughly) asfollows:  (a) Manufacturing industry Governmental and private... 64,000of which government sugar refineries      ......4,500Government textile        ...      ......8,400Government tobacco      ...      ...      ... 2,000Government chemicals    ...      ...      ... 2,500Private textiles      .........      ... 20,600Private wool carding       ...      ...      ... 2,000Private match factories   .........4,000Other industries (miscellaneous)...... 20,000Anglo-Iranian Oil Co..............      ... 72,500Government Railways................ 17,900Mines     ..................... 4,900Silos..................... 1,100Fisheries..................... 2,300Hand looms and carpet weavers (estimated)...... 151,000Grand total    ...............    313,700(b) Civil service, including teachers, amounts to about 77,000, without includingthe Ministry of Finance and its subsidiaries, which may have anythingfrom 40,000 to 70,000 personnel, plus the Army, Gendarmerie, police and Ministry of War, exact figures of which are unknown.(c) Agriculture. About 12 million of the population are directly or indirectlyengaged in agriculture.3. Before and since the war economic life in Iran has been perilous. every year there has been acute distress particularly during the winter months, whichcould have been largely avoided by planning in advance. Last winter adverse weather and heavy snow interrupted deliveries and prevented supplies reaching thetown, thereby causing a temporary rise in prices. Attempts to counter this increase by fixing maximum prices proved unsuccessful and merely served to drive certaingoods off the market. Refugees from Azerbaijan (the northern danger spot on theRussian frontier) came to Tehran following the failure of various relief schemes andhad to be sent back at considerable public cost.4. During March and April the Ministry of Labour estimated that about40,000 adult male workers were wholly unemployed in Tehran alone. The figure for the whole of the country was given as roughly 100,000. The seasonal depressionwas partly responsible, but the main cause was said to be prevailing credit restric-tion policy. The textile industry has remained in a depressed condition overseveral years and a number of factories have shut down completely. The textilefactory owners attribute the trade depression to high wages, taxation and foreigncompetition. The textile industry is at present relying on help by way of loans fromthe Seven-Year Plan.  The Trade Union leaders claim, however, that nothing less
than a complete reorganisation of the industry will save it from total economicdisaster. They also suggest the introduction of British experts, but this would notbe any solution unless they were given executive authority, which so far the Persianshave refused. (Incidentally, the newspaper Dad of 13th August stated that ameeting has been held between the factory owners and Government representatives,where it was decided that a delegation of foreign experts shall be called in to study and decide the future position of the factories.) The Seven-Year Plan, for example,goes no further than to sanction the admission of Overseas Consultants. Road-making and repairing have been the main palliatives for reducing unemployment and many thousands of men have been absorbed into the various road schemes in Tehran and the provinces. The Council of Ministers has also approved moneyallocations for various other projects, including the building of hotels at Tehranand other provincial towns. There are no reliable statistics to indicate the exactstate of employment, but it has been estimated that at least a quarter and probablynearer one-third of workers outside the agricultural industry are unemployed.In Tehran the Government has recently cleared the beggars from the streets andaccommodated them in a camp where they are to be sorted out and the able-bodiedsection of them placed in temporary employment. This arrangement has minimisedthe outward visible sign of local distress. In the agricultural industry there is atpresent more or less full employment on seasonal work. The return to the peasantsfor their labour under the feudal system, however, barely provides a living for mostof them, and the average annual income valued in rials for peasants working theirown plot of ground is said to be about 3,000, aproximately  30. A short time ago the former Prime Minister told the Ambassador that the peasants had little tocomplain about, as in some cases they received as much as 75 per cent from theland allotted to them. What the Prime Minister omitted to add was that even ifthey got all the proceeds from the plot of land they cultiyate it would still not bring them above poverty level. The peasants are unorganised, but Trade Union leadersI have spoken to say that the vast majority of the peasants are bordering onstarvation and in many of the villages have to eat grass at certain periods of theyear to keep them alive, while at the other end of the scale the wealthy landlordsride about in luxurious limousines and never see the land they are supposed tocontrol. Instead, they rely on their local agents to ensure that they get their shareof the profits. A Bill to distribute Government lands is awaiting approval of theMajlis. The Bill provides for the sale of land at fixed prices. If passed, however,it will not benefit the small farmers very much as they have no money for landpurchase.Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.5. The main problem at the A.I.O.C. has been redundancy of labour. Inthe early part of this year the Company decided on the bulk discharge of500 redundant workers after a review of the labour position. There was a gooddeal of local agitation about these discharges owing to the heavy unemploymentin Iran generally and the obvious difficulty of finding alternative employment forthe discharged workers. Mohammadi, leader of the Central Union of Oil Workers,approached the Company through the normal channels of negotiation and askedfor the notices of discharge issued to the redundant workers to be withdrawn.As the Company refused to consider their decision, Mohammadi approached theMinistry of Labour in Tehran for assistance in pursuing his claim on behalf of thedischarged workers. Conferences were held between representatives of theCompany, including Lindon, the Industrial Relations Adviser, and Ministry ofLabour officials. The Company refused to give way on the question of the bulkdischarges, but undertook to pay special gratuities to each discharged worker overand above the retiring gratuity of one week&apos;s pay for each year of continuous service,payable under the Labour Law. Mohammadi at first accepted the Company&apos;s offerbut later repudiated it at meetings in Abadan, and then proceeded to threaten ageneral stoppage of work throughout the Abadan Refinery. These threats were expressed at open meetings and the military authorities decided to detainMohammadi. The Company then decided to discharge him, but arranged for himto have the full gratuity to which he was entitled in respect of his 25 years&apos; service with the Company. The military authority afterwards ordered him to leave thedistrict and placed a ban upon his return. Thus ended the career of Mohammadi,who at first showed signs of becoming a reliable Trade Union leader. It seems]however, that his too close association with Tudeh elements proved his undoing.39566 n 7
There were no awkward repercussions as the result of his dismissal, and the position at Abadan has been very much quieter without him. A new leader of the Centra?Union of Oil Workers has been appointed, but it is doubtful whether he will makethe grade.6. After Mohammadi was discharged he made various complaints aboutthe A.I.O.C.  The main ones were:-(1) Shortages of housing accommodation for Iranian labour grades.(2) Inadequacy of the minimum wage.(3) Extension of sub-contracting.(4) Company&apos;s hostility to workers&apos; organisations and union leaders.The only one of these complaints with any real validity was the shortage of housing accommodation. . At the end of March this year 5,498 Iranian workers out of atotal of 30,521 were housed by the Company at Abadan. In the Fields areasapproximately 35 per cent, of the labour grades were housed in Company quarters.A special rent allowance, given by the Company to unhoused workers, of 69 Rialsper month mitigated hardship to some extent, but there is a general feeling of discontent over the Company&apos;s failure to build more houses.7. The cost-of-living position in Khuzistan was rather more favourable thisyear than last. Figures supplied by the Company&apos;s economic adviser showed thatthe average minimum &quot; basket&quot; cost, including subsidised items supplied by theCompany for the twelve months ended March 1950, was 38 Rials per day asagainst the statutory minimum of 40 Rials. It is significant that no claim for a revision of the minimum wage (statutorily fixed for February of each year underthe Labour Law) has yet been tabled by the workers&apos; representatives.8. So far as could be ascertained there had been no extension of the Com-pany&apos;s policy to sub-contract various kinds of work such as, building, road construction, &amp;c, on which about 10,000 workers are employed. It is neverthelessa sore point with ex-employees of the Company employed by sub-contractors thatthey are doing the same kind of work they originally performed as direct employees of the Company, but are now deprived of the enhanced minimum wage secured by the Company&apos;s subsidies on various commodities, and also do not enjoy theother Company privileges and amenities, including housing accommodation.9. When I visited Khuzistan last May I could find no general evidence of hostility by the Company to the workers&apos; representatives or Union leaders, though some of the Management criticised the tactics of certain troublesome officials. Itis probably true that some of the junior Management are still a little apprehensive of joint consultation, and occasionally the efforts of Industrial Relations Officersmay be nullified by the Management through a wrong handling of staff problems.The Industrial Relations Staff under Lindon appear to be performing a very difficult task with sympathy and tolerance. One of their major difficulties is that themajority of the Iranian workers are illiterate and know very little about the truepurposes of Trade Unionism. In consequence it is not easy to direct their growingassertiveness into constitutional and mutually advantageous channels. JointDepartmental Committees on a voluntary basis, and informal discussions betweenworkers&apos; representatives and Industrial Relations Officers resolve most of the day-to-day problems. The tri-partite Factory Councils (which include a Ministry ofLabour representative) set up under the Labour Law are how mainly used to fix the minimum wage and administer the Health and Aid Funds. The Tudeh Partyhave sufficient active members in Khuzistan to ensure the regular distribution ofthe weekly Communist paper Mardum and periodical Tudeh pamphlets. It is significant however that, although they must have exploited to the full the bulkdischarge of Workers at Abadan, the Tudeh enthusiasts failed to provoke a stoppage of work. In my opinion their influence will diminish as Trade Unionism isdeveloped in the area.10. Fresh criticism of the Supplementary Oil Agreement has greatly helped the Tudeh campaign. Great play has been made of the large profits of the A.I.O.Cjin articles published in the Persian press, and Trade Union leaders have asked why some of the profits cannot be devoted to the building of more houses for the iranian workers, and are by no means satisfied with the explanation that the main reason is the shortage of building supplies, :   ; o;
General11. The independent Trade Union leaders have little faith in the present government. They say it is merely the old gang operating under a new label. Theydistrust Razmara, former staunch supporter of the politically controlled E.S.K.I.,because they believe that he has no intention of allowing the independent TradeUnions to become strong enough to take an active part in supporting the workers&apos;interests. They think that anything they try to do will be frustrated, and that the rulers will continue to talk about social reforms while the workers look in vain forpositive signs that the national authorities intend to improve conditions or are really interested in the welfare of the mass of the population. When Razmarabecame Prime Minister he instructed Khonsari. who replaced Nafisi as Under-Secretary to the Ministry of Labour, to call the Union leaders together in an endeavour to co-ordinate their activities. At first the independent leaders refusedto co-operate unless, and until, the Labour Law was enforced throughout thecountry. (It is doubtful whether any employers, apart from the A.I.O.C., areobserving the Labour Law.) Later they withdrew this condition, and a ProvisionalCommittee has been set up comprising five representatives from each of the fourmain Trade Union sections E.S.K.I., E.M.K.A., Gezelbash&apos;s breakaway Union, andthe oil workers in Khuzistan. Up to the time of writing this report the oil workers&apos;representatives have not actually joined the Committee, although they have been invited to do so. The independent Trade Union leaders fear that the ProvisionalCommittee is yet another political trap to bolster up E.S.K.I., which, since thefailure of Hidayat (E.S.K.I.&apos;s leader) to secure a seat in the Majlis from the Tehranelections last March, has shown signs of disintegration.12. After two years the Seven-Year Plan is regarded with suspicion becauseof the slowness of its operation; it is now popularly referred to in Trade Unioncircles as the 70-Year Plan. It is doubtful whether more than 2,000 workers are atpresent employed on Seven-Year Plan projects.13. The cost of living has risen apart from sugar, bread and meat, which areartificially controlled for the time being. There is a good deal of labour unrestbecause of inefficient management and plant, and the resultant failure of industryto produce at prices sufficiently low to compete with imported goods.14. The Trade Unions also strongly oppose the continuation of martial lawin Khuzistan, and while they are not enamoured of the National Front membersof the Majlis (numbering 11 out of 126), the Trade Unions support them in their recent demand for a modification of the power of the Government to impose martial law in any area at any, time and continue it indefinitely. The independent unions have suffered considerably in the past through military intervention in the variouslocalities, and greatly resent the restrictions placed upon their activities in this way.At Isfahan recently the Military Commander informed Kaivan (local leader ofE.M.K.A. Federation) that Razmara wanted everybody to belong to E.S.K.I. InMay last the Military Governor at Isfahan issued an order in which he stated that,owing to disturbances from conflicts between E.S.K.I. and the independent Unions,all gatherings or meetings would be regarded as disturbing order, and would bedealt with according to the regulations of the Military Governor.15. Another item troubling the independent Unions is the rigging of elections for the Majlis. At present the wealthy landlords hold the field and take full advantage of the illiterate workers they control, whose votes enable them to getthemselves elected and continue in office as Deputies under consecutive Govern-ments. The National Front has tabled a Bill for the franchise to be confined tothose voters who are literate. The Bill has not the slightest chance of being passed,as the present reactionary members of the Majlis can hardly be expected to votethemselves out of office.16. The Trade-Union position itself is perhaps less tense as a result of the setting up of the Provisional Committee referred to above. With a view to testingthe possibility of setting up a central Trade Union organisation, the independentleaders have agreed to co-operate with E.S.K.I., but before reaching the preparationof a draft constitution they have suggested that one member from each of the fourgroups on the Provisional Committee should draw up a programme indicating theirviews on social reforms and improvements, examination of the Labour Law, organ -isation of the peasants, &amp;c. In this way the independent Unions propose to test thebona fides of E.S.K.I. before agreeing to join with them through the medium ofsome central organisation.  It is not possible at this stage to foresee the ultimate
results of these developments. If once again they end inconclusively it is difficultto see what the next move can be.17. There have been several strikes and demonstrations during the past sixmonths, mainly about low wages and the withholding of wages by employers. Atthe tobacco factory in Tehran there were free fights last April between supportersand opponents of E.S.K.I. over Hidayafs failure to win the Tehran elections, and inthe general melee two workers were badly injured. At the Government textilefactory in Shahi riots developed during the latter half of April over the threateneddismissal of a number of workers alleged to be ex-members of the Tudeh Party,who had enjoyed a privileged position and high wages since the time that the TudehParty was strong in the area. The military restored order, but in the process a few people were killed and others wounded. There were also several unorganised strikesat individual factories over non-payment of wages and employers&apos; failure to observe the statutory minimum wage.18. These strikes and demonstrations have been spontaneous outbursts, butthey are undoubtedly ominous signs of a growing discontent over unsatisfactoryworking conditions. The strict enforcement of the Labour Law would go a longway towards remedying the position. It is doubtful however whether any effectivesteps to achieve this will be taken by the Government in the absence of any drivingforce from organised Trade Unionism. Trade Union activities can, of course, onlybe co-ordinated successfully through a central body. If this could be secured theemployers may be forced to follow suit. At present organisation on their side ispractically non-existent. Quite clearly sound organisation on both sides is an essen-tial prerequisite of collective bargaining, and in the present uncertain position thedsillusioned worker can hardly be blamed for turning to the Tudeh Party as analternative hope for his survival.W. E. THOMAS, Labour Attache.British Embassy, Tehran,\Ath August, 1950.ANNEX extract from a Report by the Labour Attache in Persia on Housing inAbadan and the Oil FieldsThe main complaint in Abadan and the fields is the shortage of housing accom-modation for Iranian graded staff.   At the end of March this year the position was:  Category	Strength	Housed	PercentageHead Artisans	1,386	1,288	92-9Grade I        ......	8,791	2,518	28-6Grade II        ......	6,268	549	8-7Grade III      ......	2,007	49	2-4Unskilled classes	...    12,069	1,094	9-1	30,523	5,498	18-0There are four housing areas in Abadan Bahmashir, Ferahabad, Bahar andAhmedabad. In the first three of these there are 5,454 brick-built houses; 3,461have been allocated to labour, the remainder to non-graded.staff, Pakistani and indian labourers, or used for various services. Each house has its own drinkingwater supply, sanitation and electricity. All but about 500 houses have electricfans for cooling purposes. In the Ahmedabad area there are 812 labour quartersbuilt of mud bricks. Some of the houses are occupied by Iranian Police and anumber used for other services. Fifty houses are unsuitable for allocation. Drinkingwater is supplied at communal water points and lavatories are communal. There,are no asphalt roads between the quarters and no electricity supply, and generallyspeaking there is no surface drainage.   A number of the quarters in this area were
demolished during the year, but the workers are not anxious for further demolition.They apparently prefer mud brick houses to bazaar accommodation at high prices.There are also 388 tents in an area known as the Abol Hassan Camp. The tentsmainly accommodate married couples and their families. There is a possibility thatthese tents will be dispensed with before winter and the occupants moved to other more permanent accommodation. Overcrowding was prevalent in all areas. Of4,058 labour quarters, 1,177 house two married couples and 172 three marriedcouples. There are 6,000 lodgers in the brick-built houses. Failure to make more rapid progress on the housing schemes has been severely criticised by workers&apos;representatives and also by the Tudeh propagandists. The present building pro-gramme is about 800 new nouses per year, which may be extended by the adoptionof a new type of brick house known as the Arcoh house. A terrace of these wasbuilt for inspection by the Company&apos;s directors who visited Abadan a few months ago. Several Arcon houses can be built under one roof, which means a considerablesaving of time and building materials. It may therefore be possible this year forthe building programme to be stepped up, assuming that the Arcon type of house isfinally approved. In the Fields areas approximately 35 per cent, of the labourgrades are accommodated in Company houses or quarters. All unhoused workersreceive a special rent allowance of 60 rials a month. This increases the &quot; basket &quot;allowance from 150 to 210 rials. Average bazaar rentals for one room in working-class quarters have fallen from 350 rials per month in 1948 to about 240 rials inMarch 1950. As the Company&apos;s housing scheme progresses bazaar rentals will doubtless continue to fall.British Embassy, Tehran,23rd June&apos;, 1950.
