THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT      a a rX JL 3The circulation of this paper has bepn ^ r^ctly limited.It is issued for the personal use of top SECRET Copy No.   J 2CP.(50) 22812TH OCTOBER, 1950CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME FOR 1950/51 session memorandum by the Lord President of the Council ,At their meeting on 11th May last (CM. (50) 30th Conclusions,Minute 3) the Cabinet accepted a provisional programme of legislation forthe 1950/51 Session drawn up by the Future Legislation Committee, andthe drafting of Bills has been proceeding.2. The Future Legislation Committee have kept the provisional programme under scrutiny, in consultation with the Ministers concerned,and they now submit for approval by the Cabinet the programme set outin Groups I - IV of Annex A to this memorandum.3. If the new Session runs from next month until the end of July,1951, there will be about 150 sitting days, of which rather less than 80 willbe available for legislation.   If 20 Fridays are allotted to private members, about 60 days would remain for Government measures.    Inthe present Parliamentary situation, full use cannot be made of standing committees and many Bills will have to be taken through all their stageson the floor of the House.     It may well prove to be impossible tq find time for all the Bills contemplated in the programme.4. By reason of the number of Bills in the programme on which afinal decision to proceed has not yet been taken, or for which policy approvalhas not yet been secured, the planning of the business of the Sessionpresents great difficulties.    In spite of continuous pressure on departments to have legislation ready at the beginning of the Session, only;15 Bills arelikely to be available for immediate introduction.   As in past years it willbe necessary for the Legislation Committee to take the necessary steps toregulate the flow of new legislation in the course of the Session.   But, inthe meantime, Ministers should see that, where necessary, policy approvalis secured as quickly as possible for contemplated Bills, and that draftinginstructions are issued without delay.5. The Committee felt that the special attention of the Cabinet shouldbe drawn to the following points:-(a)     The Economic Planning and Full Employment Bill has been includedin the programme, although a final decision has still to be taken whether toproceed with it.    The Cabinet decided to consider the Bill again in the lightof any proposals for including in it powers of positive planning.   since a major Bill of this character would have to be mentioned in The King&apos;sSpeech it will be necessary for a final decision to be taken about the Bill inthe course of the coming week.

lib(b) The Overseas Operations (Security of Forces) bill has been included, although a final decision on the introduction of theBill has still to be taken.(c) The Law of Defamation Bill and the Law of Defamation (Scotland)Bill  have been omitted from the programme, because it appears to be undesirable to proceed with these Bills until it is known whether then ewspaper proprietors propose to take any action for the setting up ofa Press Council.(d) The work of the Distribution and Marketing Committee, under thechairmanship of the Minister of Town and Country Planning, should providematerial for a number of Bills dealing, inter alia, with the protectionof consumers, the distribution of fruit and vegetables, meat distribution,resale price maintenance and hire purchase.    The balance of advantageappears to lie in holding these matters over for the time being.(e) A number of other Bills have been omitted from the finalprogramme because it is not clear at this stage that legislation will infact be ready for next Session.   These are set out in Annex B.    We havenot, however, included Bills on which Departments could not, at thisstage, give any definite indication of their contents.6. There will shortly be discussions with the Opposition on thequestion whether and how much Private Members&apos; time should be allowednext Session.H. M.Office of the Lord Presidentof the Council, S.
