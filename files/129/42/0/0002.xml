(Lkl //if.   it Alt -fc^io     .      gDOCUMENT IS THE   PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1950CONFIDENTIAL , Copy No.   ^2CP. (50) 2022nd September, 1950CABINETERITREAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs. We have to decide our policy regarding the future disposal of Eritrea in thelight of recent developments.   My recommendations are:  (a) That the United Kingdom Delegation in New York should support, in the interim Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations, thedraft resolution annexed to this memorandum providing for a federationbetween Eritrea and Ethiopia, on condition that the Italian andEthiopian Governments both accept it and that it seems likely to com-mand a good majority in the Interim Committee.(b) That the United Kingdom Delegation agree to the insertion in paragraph of the draft resolution of the words &quot; two years,&quot; to cover the transitional period during which the present British Administration will continue.If it should prove necessary, in order to secure the adoption of a resolu-tion otherwise acceptable to us, we should agree to a transitional periodof not exceeding three years.(c) That we should be prepared to offer the Italian Government an assurance that we would consult them on all major steps in connection with the carrying out of the terms of the draft resolution, if this should prove necessary. We should almost certainly have to offer a similar assurance to the Ethiopian Government.background. For more than two years, the policy for the future of Eritrea which wehave consistently advocated in the United Nations and elsewhere has been to pro-pose the incorporation of the Eastern Provinces in Ethiopia, together with a separatesolution for the Western (predominantly Moslem) Province. In our opinion this solution might have been to incorporate the Western Province in the adjacentSudan. At the same time we recognised that it would be necessary to providesafeguards for the Italian minority in the Eastern Provinces. This policy was basedprimarily upon the wishes of the inhabitants so far as they could be ascertained,upon the historic ties between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and upon considerations of administrative practicability.3. After failing, during its third session, to reach an agreement upon thedisposal of the ex-Italian colonies, the General Assembly of the United Nationsduring its fourth session resolved on 21st November, 1949, to send a United nations commission to Eritrea to report to the Interim Committee of the General assembly on the disposal of the territory. This Commission sent in a divided report^ to the interim Committee, one of its members being in favour of outright incorporation in Ethiopia of Eritrea (less possibly the Western Province), two favouring federationbetween Eritrea and Ethiopia and two favouring independence for Eritrea. the interim Committee is now faced with the task of making a recommendation to theGeneral Assembly upon this report.4. As soon as the probable nature of the United Nations Commission^ reportbecame apparent, it seemed likely that the solution which we had hitherto advocatedwould not find sufficient support in the General Assembly and that the best availablecompromise would probably be a recommendation in favour of some form of39298
federation. With this end in view, therefore, the Foreign Office, in conjunctionwith representatives of the United States Government, worked to reconcile theItalian and Ethiopian Governments to the prospect of federation. We were themore anxious to reach a compromise solution, since agreement between theItalians and Ethiopians upon the future of Eritrea has always seemed to be the key to future Italo-Ethiopian relations in general. The result of our efforts andthose of other Governments, particularly the United States, has been the productionof the draft resolution at annex, to which it is hoped that both the Italian andEthiopian Governments will give their support. While there are grave practicaldifficulties in the way of federating two such entities as Ethiopia and Eritrea, Iam satisfied that a compromise of this kind is the only one which is likely to securethe necessary majority in the General Assembly of the United Nations and thus to settle the future of Eritrea.5. So far as we are concerned, the main disadvantage of the resolution isthat we shall have to continue the administration of Eritrea for at any rate twoyears more, and to accept responsibility for carrying through the federal proposals and setting up indigenous governmental institutions in Eritrea where none suchexist. The resolution provides that in this task we should be assisted by a united nations Commissioner; it may well be that we shall be pressed also to accept a united Nations Advisory Council, somewhat on the model of that set up in libya. This I should be most reluctant to do, and if such a provision were inserted in the resolution it might become necessary to reconsider our attitude towards it.Meanwhile, the continued administration of the territory for two years will neces-sarily entail some expenditure, and may involve keeping British troops in Eritreato maintain order and security. It is difficult to estimate the probable cost of running the country during the next two years, especially since, in preparing Eritreafor federation, we may have to depart to some extent from a strict &quot; care-and-maintenance &quot; basis; the best annual figure which I am able to give as a roughestimate is  750,000. This is on the assumption that conditions remain disturbed;if things settle down in Eritrea, this figure would no doubt decrease. In addition there is an adverse balance of trade, but for various reasons it is impossible toestimate the cost of this to His Majesty&apos;s Government. As regards British forces,there are at present approximately two battalions stationed in Eritrea; we might hope to reduce this if conditions quietened.6. In view of the fact that the draft resolution might be tabled at the InterimCommittee in the very near future, instructions have already been sent to the UnitedKingdom Delegation in New York to support the resolution and to agree to theinclusion of a figure of two years for the transitional period. I now ask mycolleagues to approve the recommendations set out above.E B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,2nd September, 1950.annex draft Resolution on the Future of EritreaThe Interim Committee,Having considered the Report of the United Nations Commission for Eritrea,Recommends to the General Assembly that it approve the following resolution:Whereas by paragraph 3 of Annex XI to the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947,the Powers concerned have agreed to accept the recommendation of the general assembly on the disposal of the former Italian Colonies in Africa and to take appropriate measures for giving effect to it; andWhereas by paragraph 2 of the aforesaid Annex XI such disposal is to be madein the light of the wishes and welfare of the inhabitants and the interests of peace and security, taking into consideration the views of interested Governments:Now, therefore,The General Assembly, in the light of the Report of the United nations commission for Eritrea and the recommendations of the Interim Committee, and
