THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1950SECRETCP. (50) 23116th October, 1950CABINETPROPOSAL TO TRANSFER THE BRITISH SUGAR corporation to PUBLIC  OWNERSHIPMemorandum by the Minister of food. At the meeting of the Committee on Socialisation of Industries on11th October (S.I. (M) (50) 8th Meeting, Minute 2), the Committee recommendedthat legislation should be introduced for the transfer of the British Sugar Corpora-tion to public ownership, and invited me to submit the recommendation to theCabinet as soon as possible, with a view to the mention of the proposed measure in the King&apos;s Speech. I attach as an annex to this paper the memorandum which I circulated to the Committee, and in which I set out the reasons why I believepublic ownership to be the right course for us to follow.2. I feel there is little I need add to the arguments set out in my original paper.In my judgment there can be no question, in the light of our whole policy of eco-nomic planning and of developments such as the Agriculture Act, 1947, of anyreturn to the principle of the Sugar Industry (Reorganisation) Act of 1936. TheBritish Sugar Corporation was set up solely as an instrument of Government policy,and yet for political reasons then current it took the form of a Corporation inwhich all the shares were left in private hands. Clearly, a semi-independent concern of this type, in which the private capital is not at risk and plays no coherent purpose,is out of keeping with the true requirements of the situation and our present thought.3. It is quite true that we could sidestep the issue at the moment by arrangingto extend year by year, by emergency powers, the provisions of the war-time sugar industry Act of 1942. I think that it would be wrong to do this, since not only should we leave over a legacy of uncertainty, but to do so would disturb our supporters in the House and the country in view of the Party&apos;s declaration of policy for thefuture control of the sugar industry.4. If the Cabinet agree to this proposal an appropriate reference will beincluded in The King&apos;s Speech: a suitable form of words has, indeed, already beenagreed. My Department will then proceed to prepare the necessary Bill, in thelight of the comments made at the meeting of the Socialisation of Industries Com-mittee on 11th October, and they will refer their proposals to that Committee indue course. As far as I can see, the Bill itself need not be an elaborate measure. Inthe main it will provide for (a) the transfer of the shares of the Corporation to public ownership, (b) the arrangements for the payment of compensation, and (c) the relationship between the reconstituted Corporation and the Government. But(c) will involve important and far-reaching considerations, while a further vital pointwill be the negotiation with the refining interest of a revised and more satisfactoryrefining agreement. These matters will necessitate close interdepartmental discus-sion before negotiations can begin.5. In putting forward the proposal, I am assuming that, as a corollary, weshall proceed to arrange that the Government is given in permanent form the powerto maintain the present monopoly of sugar imports. If this is done, and the british sugar Corporation is brought under public ownership, we shall, in my judgment,have achieved effective public control of the sugar industry.39494 bc* toCopy No. d h,

I accordingly ask my colleagues to endorse the recommendation that theBritish Sugar Corporation should be transferred to public ownership, and toauthorise me to instruct my Department to initiate the necessary action.M. W.  .Ministry of Food, S.W. 1,16th October, 1950.ANNEX[S.I. (M) (50) 341th October, 1950]PROPOSAL TO TRANSFER THE BRITISH SUGAR corporation to  PUBLIC  OWNERSHIP. , .. Memorandum by the Minister of FoodL-Summary1. Legislation will be required during 1951 to replace the Sugar Industry(Reorganisation) Act, 1936, in the light of experience gained in regulating theGovernments relations with the British Sugar Corporation and of present condi-tions, since the provisions of the war-time amending legislation, the Sugar industry act, 1942, will expire on 31st March, 1952. I therefore invite my colleagues ; (i.) to decide in principle whether the existing status of the Corporation asa semi-independent trading concern should be preserved, or whether theCorporation should be taken into full public ownership, and(ii) to authorise the submission of proposals for legislation to implement thatdecision.II. Pre-War and Existing Statutory Arrangements2. I refer my colleagues to the Appendix to this memorandum in which Ihave, outlined the development of pre-war and existing statutory arrangements for organising, controlling, and assisting the beet sugar industry through the medium of the British Sugar Corporation, of which we must take account in determining our future, relations with the industry.Ill-Future legislation. It is our present intention to provide for the extension of the provisions ofthe 1942 Act in the arrangements for continuation of emergency powers for oneyear after 10th December next. The effect of this extension will be that the pro-visions of the 1942 Act will expire on 31st March, 1952. On that date the 1936 Actwill be automatically revived unless amending or new legislation is passed in themeantime. The fact that new legislation would in any event be required to replace the 1936 Act in the light of experience and changed conditions, raises the questionof principle as to the Governments future relations with the Corporation, whichmay be resolved into a choice between two courses . Either (a) Parliament can be asked to pass new legislation to give the Corpora-tion a new lease of life in its present and pre-war status of a semi-independent trading enterprise financed by private capital, subject to the controls imposed by the 1936 Act and subsidised by the Exchequer;or (b) the Corporation can be taken into full public ownership.In neither ease would it be necessary to revive the Sugar Commission in its originalform since its principal duties are now being undertaken by my Department and the agriculture Departments.
Nationalisation4. For the following main reasons I am of the opinion that the better coursewould be for the Corporation to be nationalised.5. The Agriculture Act, 1947, has affected the Corporation^ place in thenational economy. Before the war it was found convenient to use the Corporationas a medium for subsidising the uneconomic process of growing sugar beet, butwe now have statutory obligations to the sugar beet growers and in consequencethe Corporation now has no part in negotiating the price of sugar beet. The futurerole of the Corporation in this field will be limited to discharging the Governmentsstatutory obligations by providing an assured market and guaranteed prices for sugar beet. This role would in my view be incompatible with its pre-war status as a semi-independent trading enterprise financed by private capital and inhibited inits outlook by the presence on its Board of representatives of private and indeedrival interests. A secondary but important consideration is the beet sugar industry&apos;contribution towards essential food supplies in time of war.6. So far as the direction of its activities is concerned the Corporation isalready subject to control in many ways more detailed than any other nationalisedBoard. The Chairman who has special powers of veto is appointed by the Govern-ment. Two other directors are appointed by the Government and all otherappointments to the Board are subject to Government approval. The Corpora-tion&apos;s production and marketing programme must be approved by the Government;prices of sugar beet and sugar beet pulp are fixed by the Government; my Depart-ment fixes selling prices of raw and refined sugar; provision for depreciation is fixed in consultation with Government Departments; appointments to senior postsat headquarters and in the factories are approved Departmentally. In fact it wouldnot untrue to say that the Corporation is as near a nationalised industry as a conservative administration could be expected to establish. Much of the complica-tions in its relation with Government follow from their attempt to combine nationalcontrol with private ownership.7. While in these circumstances there could be little or no controversy inconverting the present system of statutory control into direction under public ownership, the controversial issues would be the replacement by Governmentstock of the share capital now held by private shareholders and the removal ofrival private interests from the Board of Directors. But it is in my view essential in the public interest that the Government should take complete financial controlof this subsidised industry whose sole purpose is to implement our agricultural and defence policy. The present anomalous position of the private shareholderis in itself sufficient justification for depriving the Corporation of its semi-independent status in providing an income for private investors. On the one hand the present shareholders take no risk, despite the pre-war commercial basis of theCorporation^ operations implicit in the &quot; subsidy-forecast &quot; procedure and the incentive Agreement, since their minimum &quot; reasonable rate&quot; of interest isguaranteed by the Treasury and the substantial Exchequer assistance required bythe Corporation takes account of the guaranteed interest rate. On the other hand the private shareholders can exercise little, if any, control over the Corporation^activities and their interests are always subordinated to Government policy.8. Notwithstanding their exclusion from participation in the management of the Corporations affairs, the private shareholders enjoy the &quot; free income &quot;derived from the Incentive Agreement payments over and above the guaranteed&quot; reasonable rate &quot; of interest on their capital. During 1939-45 annual incentiveearnings amounted to  70,000 or 1 - 4 per cent, on share capital and in 1949 to the record figure of  643,622 or 12 - 8 per cent. By using these incentive earnings to supplement the guaranteed &quot; reasonable rate,&quot; the Corporation has consistentlypaid a dividend on share capital of 4J per cent, since 1939. The Government,moreover, has no legal right to restrict the payment of dividend below the levelof 7 per cent, prescribed by the articles of association of the Corporation and in theory even if the Corporation did not operate its factories at all, the shareholderswould be entitled by the Corporation^ refined sugar quota (rights under theRefining Agreement to an annual income of some  750,000.9 In considering whether the Corporation should be taken into full public ownership my colleagues will realise that since new legislation must be introduced before 31st March, 1952 (unless the temporary powers are extended for a further39494
period), we have only two courses open to us. We can take the. positive step of recommending Parliament to confirm the Corporation^ present status as a semi-independent trading enterprise financed by private capital, notwithstanding theCorporation^ function as the subsidised instrument for discharging our obligations under the Agriculture Act and the anomalous position of the private shareholders,or, on the other hand, we can submit legislation for assuming complete financial cOn-trol of the Corporation by taking it into full public ownership. In my view we have little freedom of political choice in this decision and, on this ground alone, I am convinced that public ownership is the right solution, quite apart.from the practicalarguments I have advanced for taking the opportunity afforded by the expiry ofwar-time legislation to remove existing anomalies in our relations with theCorporation.10. Rather than achieving any substantial saving in money, it is the very factthat the beet sugar industry inevitably requires substantial Exchequer assistance which in my view also necessitates complete and positive control of the Corporationby means of public ownership. Nationalisation will not of itself improve technical efficiency and reduce costs. There would, however, be some small saving to theExchequer if the present share capital were replaced by ordinary Government stockbearing a lower rate of interest and the Incentive Agreement could be wound upin its present form. The Corporation could not be expected to reach the positionof paying its own way taking one year with another for the reason that beet sugar,given the price which the home farmers need for the beet, has never been produced at a price which can compete with the price of imported cane sugar. TheCorporation has received since 1936 some  40 million in the form of subsidies anddeficiency payments and, while consideration must be given to reducing assistanceto the minimum level consistent with the most effective means of securingagricultural objectives, the Corporation will continue to require a subsidy. Thetransfer of the ownershp of the share capital cannot in itself make for greater efficiency, but would facilitate advantageous changes in the composition of theBoard, which at present reflects the methods adopted in 1936 for resolving the conflict between the beet sugar and sugar refining industries. It would also securethat any help given by the Government to the Corporation to secure increased efficiency in the industry would not result in increased gain by the privateshareholders.11. The policy statement of the Labour Party &quot;Let Us Win ThroughTogether &quot; said: &quot; We propose that beet sugar manufacture and sugar refiningshall.be transferred to national ownership for the benefit of the consumers.&quot; Aproposal to nationalise the beet sugar industry while leaving the refining industry under private enterprise will not pass unchallenged by the refiners. They will feel,I think, that such a step would inevitably mean an extension of control over theirown operations and probably their eventual nationalisation. A proposal to nationalise the section of the industry which requires Government assistance, while leaving the sugar-refining industry in private ownership may also be questioned by our own supporters. But, despite these factors, I feel at this stage that our best course is to proceed with this simple operation of bringing the Corporation into fullpublic ownership. This can be represented as the final step in achieving effectivepublic management of the sugar supplies of this country. We are now committedfor eight years ahead to purchase on contract from the Commonwealth countries the major part of our sugar supplies, and I am now considering the permanent arrangements which will be necessary, to implement this agreement. It will benecessary to seek in permanent form the emergency powers afforded by the Import,Export, and Customs Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, to prohibit private imports of sugar and to maintain monopoly purchase. Imported supplies of sugar will therefore be publicly owned and nationalisation of the beet sugar industry will bring the domestic supplies under public ownership. The refining industry will thenbe dependent on my Ministry for supplies of raw sugar and so long as sugar sellingprices are fixed, we shall be able to control the refiners&apos; margins. Such controlsensure that the consumers&apos; interests can be safeguarded and, if necessary, by meansof them protection can be given to the British Sugar Corporation. The refiningindustry will then be very circumscribed but at least until we have had experienceof its working under ^ach conditions, it is difficult to see where the public interestwill be affected by the private ownership of the industry. It is an efficient industryand its product is satisfactory both in quality and price.   Its overseas sales of
refined sugar provide a useful source of foreign earnings. I do not think, therefore,we need widen the area of controversy by including the refiners in our nationalisa-tion proposals at this stage.Relations with the Refiners ,12. The problem of future relations between the nationalised beet sugar industry and the sugar refiners operating under private enterprise will requiredetailed examination, but I have no reason to believe the difficulties to be insuperable, I should therefore propose to make provision in any nationalisationscheme for revision of the existing Refining Agreement to remove undesirablerestrictions on the Corporation^ activities in order to ensure full use of its resources(paragraph 7). The incentive to the refiners to come to terms with the nationalisedbeet sugar industry lies mainly in their relations with my Department as solepurchaser of imported raw sugar and their reliance on Government protection against foreign competition by means of the customs duty mechanism. Also, theact of nationalisation will itself imply that the Government, having assumed full responsibility for complete and positive financial control of the beet sugar industry, is prepared to use its full powers to ensure in the public interest thesurvival of the industry in relation to the sugar industry as a whole on themost economic lines possible.Reconstruction    . &apos;&apos;13. The Corporation is now proceeding with the first reconstruction anddevelopment programme which it has been able to put in hand since thepresent factories were taken over in 1936. At a cost of between  9 and  10 millionit is hoped to modernise the factories and greatly increase their operational efficiency. To finance the programme the Corporation has raised a loan of 3^ million in the form of 3-J per cent, redeemable debenture stock, which was issued by a private placing in the commercial market at 98^. The contract providesfor the repayment of this debenture stock at par in the event of nationalisation.Organisation under Public Ownership14. In considering how best the beet sugar industry could be organised under public ownership, I should, of course, examine the relative merits of controlling theindustry through the medium of a public Corporation and of my Departmentassuming direct responsibility for the day-tto-day management of the industry.IV. Conclusion15.   I invite my colleagues to agree in principle (i) that  the  British  Sugar  Corporation  should  be taken into  public ownership; and(ii) that my Department may submit proposals for legislation to that effect which we should aim to pass through Parliament by 1st July, 1951,and to bring into operation on 1st January, 1952.M.

appendix the Beet Sugar IndustryPre-war and Existing Statutory arrangements. The beet sugar industry was built up between 1924 and 1936 with the aid of considerable Exchequer subsidies primarily designed to entourage the revival of the agricultural economy, but also as an assurance of part -i the nation&apos;s sugarsupplies in time of war.2. The industry&apos;s main function is to extract sugar from the roots of home-produced sugar beet. This is done either by a continuous process of manufacture and refining which in one factory carries production through from beet to refined(or white) sugar in loose, granulated form, or by manufacturing raw sugar whichthen requires refining into white sugar at a second and separate stage. MostBritish factories were designed for the &quot; continuous process &quot; method of production,but it is possible for them to stop short at the raw sugar stage. When raw beetsugar is produced, it is refined by the beet sugar factories in the &quot; off season,&quot; thatis, outside the season of the beet campaign, or passed on for refining to the &quot; sugarrefiners,&quot; whose principal function is to refine imported raw cane sugar. the by-products of the beet sugar industry are molasses, which is used for animal feeding and alcohol manufacture, and beet pulp, the residue of sliced beets following the extraction of sugar juice, which is dried and used for animal&apos; feeding.British Sugar corporation . Following the Report in 1935 of the United Kingdom Sugar IndustryInquiry Committee, the Sugar Industry (Reorganisation) Act, 1936, provided forthe amalgamation of the 15 beet sugar factory companies into one Corporation,the British Sugar Corporation. The total share capital was fixed at  5 millionissued in  1 ordinary shares in consideration of their fixed assets and goodwill tothe transferor companies, who supplied  750,000 working capital in the form of2f per cent, debenture stock guaranteed by the Treasury as to principal and interest(of which  447,000 is still outstanding). The Chairman and two other membersof the Board were appointed by the Government, the Chairman having the rightto veto decisions involving Government policy subject to Ministerial and treasury approval. The managerial and administrative structure of the Corporation andthe original appointments to the higher executive posts required Treasury approval.Government Assistance4. Assistance was provided for the Corporation in the form of an exchequer subsidy per cwt. of sugar calculated in advance of the beet campaign on the basisof experience of earlier years so as to enable the Corporation to meet its costs(including an uneconomic price for sugar beet as an encouragement to the growers),and to pay a dividend on share capital at a &quot; reasonable rate &quot; prescribed andguaranteed by the Treasury, which was fixed pre-war at 4 per cent, per annum.Once the subsidy rate was fixed the Corporation took crop risks except that theAct provided for supplementary payments if sugar production was substantially below the &quot;standard quantity &quot; owing to adverse farming conditions.Incentive to Efficiency5. In addition the Corporation was encouraged to make all possible economiesby being entitled under an Incentive Agreement entered into in 1938 with theMinister of Agriculture to receive a share of economies effected in any year inrelation to the performance of the transferor companies in the year preceding theiramalgamation.Sugar Commission6. The Act- also set up a Sugar Commission charged with general oversightof the entire sugar industry, including the activities of the sugar refiners as well asthe beet sugar industry. The Commission^ main specific functions were to fix the beet price year by year, to determine the beet acreage, to approve the Corpora-tion&apos;s refined sugar production and marketing programme, to advise the minister as to the annual rate of subsidy and to programme research and education in beetgrowing and other matters within its general oversight.
Refining Agreement7. The Corporation entered into a Sugar Refining Agreement in 1937 with the sugar refiners on lines prescribed by the Act and given statutory approval by theMinister of Agriculture. The Agreement apportioned sales of refined sugar betweenthe parties by reference to maximum quotas. These are upper entitlements and notprescriptive rights. Any party exceeding their quota had to pay a given sum percwt. to the others; similarly, unwanted quotas might be sold and required to be purchased at the same figure. The effect of this Agreement was to perpetuate thelimitation of the Corporation^ annual refined sugar production to a maximum of500,000 tons out of total pre-war home consumption of 1,900,000 tons imposed with government approval under an earlier agreement in 1933, which had been designedto restrict competition between the Corporation and the refiners in the production ofrefined sugar. The Corporation was also prohibited from producing during the beetcampaign season by the &quot; continuous process &quot; (paragraph 2 more than 70 percent, of its refined sugar quota, its remaining campaign production being restricted to raw sugar. The remaining 30 per cent, of the quota was refined in the off-season.In consideration of this restriction of the Corporation^ production of refined sugarthe refiners agreed to contribute to the Corporation^ costs by purchasing at an agreed price an extra national quota of refined sugar varying in proportion to totalrefined sugar consumption and amounting to some  300,000 per annum before thewar and  220,000 during the war. The Corporation was further restricted by theRefining Agreement in being prohibited from making &quot; speciality &quot; sugars andsyrup which were not made by the beet sugar factories before their amalgamationand which are not only more profitable than granulated sugar, but also afford a competitive advantage in selling granulated sugar.War-time Arrangements8. The &quot; subsidy-forecast &quot; procedure prescribed by the 1936 Act was unsuit-able for war conditions and was suspended by a negative Act, the Sugar industry act, 1942, which also divided the Sugar Commission^ functions between the Minis-ter of Agriculture and myself. During the war period my Department has financedthe Corporation by making annual deficiency payments sufficient to cover lossesproperly incurred on revenue account and to provide interest on share capital. this procedure has relieved the Corporation of the commercial risks implicit in the&quot; subsidy-forecast&quot; procedure (paragraph 4) and on that account the Treasury in1941 reduced the &quot; reasonable rate &quot; of interest to 3\ per cent, and in 1947 to 3  percent. The &quot; incentive &quot; payments were also modified in detail to meet war condi-tions, but the Corporation continued to receive the benefit of earlier economies,enabling the payment of dividend on share capital higher than the &quot; reasonablerate.&quot;Present Position9. The Corporation^ eighteen factories, employing throughout the year some4,500 workers and an additional 4,000 during the beet campaign, produce some500,000 tons of refined sugar annually (including refining of beet and mainlyimported cane raws in the off-season), which represents some 21-8 per cent, of theentire sugar industry&apos;s total production (including refiners&apos; exports) of some,300,000 tons. Of the raw sugar production of about 250,000 tons the Corporationretain about 50,000 tons for refining in its own factories, and sells the balance to therefiners. Production of refined beet sugar is below the capacity of the factoriesowing to the restrictive terms of the Refining Agreement. Distribution of theCorporation^ refined sugar is &quot; zoned &quot; to the North-Eastern and Eastern counties and part of the Midlands. The Corporation also produces annually some 190,000tons of molasses and 300,000 tons of beet pulp.[These figures are in respect of the 1948 calendar year.]10. The Corporation^ Board of Directors includes the Chairman and twoDirectors appointed by the Government and representatives of the sugar refiners(Tate and Lyle Group), sugar brokers (Czarnikow, Ltd.) and molasses distribution(United Molasses Co., Ltd.). At the date of the 1949 annual return nine out ofsome 3 000 shareholders held approximately half the total share capital and included the Treasury as the largest single shareholder ( 750,000), Tate and Lyle Investments,Ltd. ( 726,335) and Czarnikow, Ltd. ( 30,000).
