DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y &apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. P. (50) 230 COPY NO._3217TH OCTOBER, 1950CABINETTHE ECONOMIC PLANNING AND FULL EMPLOYMENT bill memorandum by the Minister of health on 27th July the Cabinet agreed that consideration should be givento the question of taking further powers in the Economic Planning and full employment Bill to promote a positive policy of economic planning and full employment (CM. (50) 51st Conclusions, Minute 3).   A Sub-Committeeof the Production Committee under my chairmanship has recently consideredthe powers   (though not the policy considerations involved in the practical application of these powers) which would be needed by Departments to engage in buying, selling and manufacturing goods for civilian use for the purposeof increasing employment in certain areas, preventing economic depression,improving industrial efficiency, increasing competition in monopolisticindustries, or enabling the public to enjoy any benefits which may result from long production runs;   and we also gave preliminary consideration tothe additional financial powers which might be needed to stimulate employmentin times of economic depression.Powers to buy, sell and manufacture by Departments2. I understand that the legal position (subject to the views of the attorney-General, whose advice I am seeking separately) is that a GovernmentDepartment may, by virtue of the inherent powers of the Crown, do anything which is not expressly, or implicitly, prohibited by statute.    The powers ofsome Departments, notably the Ministry of Supply (the Department to whichthe power to buy, sell and manufacture would have the widest application in practice) are, however, limited by statute, and they cannot therefore rely on the inherent powers of the Crown;   accordingly specific legislation wouldbe needed by the Minister of Supply (and. there may be other Departmentsalso) to enable him to continue on a permanent basis some of the manufacturing and trading activities which he undertakes at present and toextend those activities over a wider field.3. There are, however, two important points of principle towhich I should draw the attention of my colleagues:(i)      The first is a question of an established practice.    The Treasurygave an undertaking to the Public Accounts Committee in 1932that &quot;where it is.desired that continuing functions should beexercised by a Government Department (particularly where such functions involve financial liabilities extending beyond a given year)it is proper that the powers and duties to be exercised should be defined by specific statute&quot;.    The Ministry of Food has carriedon trading activities without specific statutory cover, but hascomplied with this undertaking by obtaining financial powers inthe Minister of Food (Financial Powers) Act, 1949.   No doubt

1 6 dsome other Departments could do likewise;   but the Ministry ofSupply would require legislative cover (and not merely statutoryfinancial authority) to continue on a permanent basis some of itspresent trading activities and to extend these activities along the lines we envisage of buying, selling and manufacturinggoods for civilian use.(ii)   The second is a point of constitutional usage.    Government manu-facture and trading for the purposes outlined in paragraph 1 above would represent a new departure in Government policy.   on constitutional and political grounds should not the Government1 seek specific statutory authority to undertake these activities and thereby obtain Parliamentary approval for them?4. While no Parliament can bind its successors, the extent to whichwe should consider ourselves bound by a Treasury undertaking to the public accounts Committee in 1932 raises in itself an important issue.    But thequestion of constitutional usage to which I have referred in paragraph 3(ii)overshadows it.   The Sub-Committee of which I am Chairman consideredthat it would not accord with constitutional practice to take such a wideview of the prerogative as to rely on the inherent powers of the Crown toenable Departments to engage in the trading activities envisaged.   they thought it was desirable to take powers now to enable Departments to engage in these activities, since economic conditions change so rapidly;and they invited me to recommend that it would be appropriate to includethese powers in the proposed Economic Planning and Full Employment Bill,for the purposes set out in Clause 1 of the present draft of the Bill.   we thought it important, however, that the new provisions required should be widely drafted so as, on the one hand, to relieve the Minister of Supply(and any other Ministers who are similarly placed) of his present statutorylimitation, and, on the other, so that the powers taken in the Bill should in no way limit the inherent powers which many Departments now enjoy.5. I therefore invite the Cabinefs approval to taking powers in theEconomic Planning and Full Employment Bill so as to enable the competent authority (as defined in the Bill) (i) to place orders on a continuing basis for products of all types produced by industry (consumer goods, utilitygoods, capital goods and indeed ships), (ii) to undertake the manufactureof any goods when he considers it expedient to do so, and (iii) to sell anyof the products obtained in either manner.Additional Financial Powers to maintain full employment6. Apart from the more obvious cases in which the Government caninfluence investment policy and the demand for consumer goods in times of economic depression (e. g. , adjustments to the rate of income tax,purchase tax and depreciation allowances;   family a 1 let waives, social insurance benefits, national insurance contributions, housing subsidies)the Sub-Committee gave preliminary examination to some adclltipnalfinancial powers which might be needed to stimulate investment in thepublic and private sectors of industry.(a)   Public sector the Government have the power to make or guarantee advances to public boards or local authorities, thus securing to them the benefit ofgilt-edged interest rates.    For reasons of general employment policy-it might be desirable for the socialised industries to undertake schemes which were not justifiable by the commercial standards which the Boards

are required to observe;   though in practice this difficulty might be overcome by agreement between the Boards and the Government, it would be possibleto take additional powers by legislation to give financial assistance to the boards in connection with schemes of this kind.(b)   Private SectorAt present our powers under section 2 of the Borrowing (Controland Guarantees) Act, 1946, are limited to guaranteeing loans for thepurpose of facilitating the reconstruction or development of an industry or part of an industry.    In a depression we might well need powers to guarantee loans to individual firms, and this might well prove to be apractical and effective way of stimulating investment.    There are a numberof other ways in which the Government might grant financial assistanceto individual firms, for example, by extending the field now covered bythe Development Areas Treasury Advisory Committee, by underwritingnew issues, or by providing facilities to insure a substantial proportionof new bank loans to small businesses.7, These suggestions illustrate part of the scope for further financial assistance to the public and private sectors of industry.   Butin order to avoid the danger that firms might look to the Treasury for help which they should find for themselves it would probably be essentialto lay down some condition;   such as that they could only be used at atime when, in the opinion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, conditionsof general unemployment and depression were prevalent or threatened.I understand that the Treasury need further time to consider the proposals outlined above.   I therefore bring these suggestions to the notice of mycolleagues merely to indicate the kind of financial powers which might beincluded in the proposed Economic Planning and Full Employment Bill,A. B.Ministry of Health, S. W. 1, ,17TH OCTOBER, 1950.
