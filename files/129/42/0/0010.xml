Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1950SECRET Copy No. 3 2CP. (50) 210 -18th September, 1950CABINET   .GERMAN  CONTRIBUTION  TO  defence memorandum by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs 1At their meeting on 15th September (CM. (50) 59th Conclusions, Minute 1)the Cabinet expressed a wish to see fuller details of the German Chancellor^communications about German participation in defence.Dr. Adenauer has, in fact, submitted three memoranda on this subject to theHigh Commissioners. These are referred to in Wahnerheide telegrams to theForeign Office (No. 1295 of 1st September, and No. 1304 of 2nd September). I now annex the full text of translations of the three documents.I would particularly draw attention to the statement in the second sub-para-graph of paragraph 4 of the memorandum dated 1st September, 1950, concerningthe Federal Chancellors readiness, should an international Western European armybe formed, to make a contribution in the shape of a German contingent.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,\%th September, 1950.annex memorandum by Dr. Adenauer referred to in Wahnerheide TelegramNo. 1295 dated 1st September, 1950. -1. The development in the Far East has caused anxiety-and a feeling ofinsecurity among the German population. The confidence that the Western World;would be in a position to meet attacks on Western Europe swiftly and effectivelyis dwindling to an alarming degree and has brought about a dangerous attitudeof lethargy on the part of the German population.2. The gravity of the situation is reflected in consideration of the Soviet forcesconcentrated in the Eastern Zone and the People&apos;s Police which is being developedthere at great speed.According to information which has been confirmed the Soviet troops in theEastern Zone area consist of two armies of mobile troops with a total of ninemotorised divisions, four tank armies with a total of thirteen divisions, i.e., in alltwenty-two motorised and armoured divisions. The divisions, calculated to number10,000 to 12,000 men, have their total complement and are assembled at the summermilitary exercise camps, ready for action. All operations staffs are available. the equipment for mobilisation (ammunition, fuel, vehicles, iron rations, &amp;c.) is in thehands of the troops, which can be ordered to march within 24 hours.These Soviet armies are stationed oh the line Neustrelitz-Doberitz/Berlin-Wittenberg/Elbe-Grimms/Harz. Their assembly area shows in the front line themotorised mobile troops; behind them in the second line are the heavy tankformations, interspersed with special artillery and anti-aircraft units. The picturethus presented must be described as a veritable strategic concentration for an offence.

The number of tanks ready for action must be assumed to be 5,000 to 6,000.r&apos; The Soviet fighter aircraft is rapidly being converted to jet fighters of the most up-to-date construction. Assuming that the pace of this conversion is maintainedit must be expected that there are at present 3,000 jet fighters, and by the end ofSeptember some 5,000 of such fighters available. The construction of fighter air-fields in the Eastern Zone for use by jet fighters has already been carried out to a large extent. In the area south of Berlin several airfields are atpresent being equipped with runways for long-distance bombers. From this it may be concluded that the Soviets intend to bring up in the near future alsoformations of the &quot; strategic air arm &quot; which have so far been assembled in theinterior of Russia. This would have to be rated as a further clear sign of offensiveintentions.In addition to these extremely strong Soviet Russian forces, the organisationof the People&apos;s Police in the Eastern Zone has been making rapid progress duringthe last few months. In this respect the development from a Police Force to a PoliceArmy is worthy of note. During the last few months some 70,000 men were taken from the general police force of the Eastern Zone and organised in para-militaryformations and given military training.These units, segregated from the general police, are divided in alert squads(&quot; Bereitschaften &quot;) and schools. At the end of July, 12,000 men were put intothe new earth-grey field uniform. The alert squads of the People&apos;s Police, ofwhom up to now forty-five have been discovered completely by our informationservice, comprise about 1,000 men each. Neither do they receive police training,nor is it intended to use them as a police force. They are being given a propermilitary training.Furthermore, fifteen colleges for training in the use of arms, together withall component parts, have been ascertained in detail. Further schools are being established. These schools are for the training of sub-commanders and officers,and each school is about 1,000 to 1,500 men strong. In addition, there are specialcolleges for training senior commanders, propaganda officers, and for training in heavy arms. The alert squads of the police are still for the most part equipped with light infantry arms. According to the latest although not yet fully confirmed reports, there are already Peopled Police divisions, equipped with tanks in LowerSilesia and near Stettin, i.e., on Polish-occupied territory. Full motorisation isintended, although not yet carried out owing to lack of material.The plans for the further development of the People&apos;s Police provide for theformation into five group commandos of two groups each (one armoured division and one motorised infantry division). The groups (divisions), according to the intended organisation scheme, will be exactly on the pattern of Soviet armydivisions.It must be expected that the People&apos;s Police will comprise about 150,000 menin the near future; the overall plan provides for some 300,000 men. information on the objective given by the Soviet and East Zone Government to these troopsis invariably to the effect that the task which they will have to perform in the nearfuture is to liberate Western Germany from her Allied despots, to remove the&quot; collaborationist Government &quot; of the Federal Republic and to cleanse western germany and unite it with the Eastern Zone to a satellite State formation. If thisis considered in conjunction with the identic public declarations of the EasternZone politicians Piech and Ulbricht, it must be concluded that preparations arebeing made in the Eastern Zone for a venture which from many points of view isreminiscent of the development of the action in Korea. It is to be expected that even in the course of this autumn, probably after the elections, in the middle ofOctober, for the entire Eastern Zone, the Soviet Government will dissociate itselfmore and more from the Eastern Zone Government granting it greater freedomof action in International Law, in order thus to enable it to start its &quot;unificationwork &quot; independently, at first by liberating Berlin and later on to continue byactions on the part of the Peopled Police against the Federal Republic. Such&quot;liberations&quot; would be provoked or accompanied by F.D.J. demonstrations andan active Fifth Column.This Fifth Column would have the task to commit acts of sabotage in theFederal Area, to disorganise Government authorities at the local, Lander andFederal level, and to play the Government authority into the hands of the function -aries of the Eastern Zone.3. The opposite forces in Western Germany are two American and two british divisions each and few French formations.
Apart from the negligible forces of the Frontier Control Service, the federal government has no forces. The police in the British Zone is organised at localgovernment level. Neither is it trained nor equipped on a uniform basis. It doesnot have adequate arms, but merely a limited number of pistols and a few carbines.Automatic fire-arms, in particular tommy-guns, are completely lacking because theyare not permitted. In the Lander of the American and French Zones the policeis partly organised at state level. It is, however, distributed in minute groups of four to a maximum of ten men over the respective Land area. Their armament andtraining is similar to that of the police in the British Zone.These police forces are totally inadequate for action against an organisedinternal enemy, let alone against an attack by the People&apos;s Police, as they are smallin number and have had no corresponding training in the use of arms nor for actionin a formed body. Nor would they be in a position to offer effective protection onthe East Zone frontier, which owing to its extreme length makes very specialdemands.Furthermore, the value of the police as an organisation to maintain order inthe towns and in the open country is extremely negligible; this has been demon-demonstrated by the Dortmund incidents in clashes with F.D.J. assemblies. Nor can thepolice reserves of a total of 10,000 men, which the Allies have permitted and whichare to be distributed among the individual Lander, be regarded as an improvementin the situation described above. In view of the fact that responsibility for theorganisation, training and composition of the personnel is largely left to the dis-cretion of the Lander, it is not to be expected that these police reserves may become an instrument which can successfully be used by the Federation at the moment when danger breaks out. The fact that these small reserves of 10,000 men have tobe allocated to the Lander means a splitting-up of forces which renders their swiftconcentration into fighting-fit units at the moment of danger technically impossible.It is impossible to develop these reserves into strong formations.4. The problem of the security of the Federation presents itself in the firstplace from the external point of view. The defence of the Federation against an outside threat rests in the first line in the hands of the occupation forces. The federal chancellor has repeatedly asked for the strengthening of the Allied forces of occupa-tion in Western Europe and hereby renews this request in the most urgent form.Indeed, the strengthening of the Allied forces of occupation in Western Europe isthe only method of demonstrating clearly to the population the resolve of theWestern Powers that Germany should be defended if a crisis comes (im Ernstfall).Such a strengthening of the Allied forces is, however, also necessary because thedefence measures now being put in hand in Western Europe can only be carried outbehind the shelter of an adequate number of well-equipped Allied divisions.Furthermore, the Federal Chancellor has repeatedly declared his readiness,should an international Western European army be formed, to make a contribution in the shape of a German contingent. This declaration makes it clear that the federal chancellor disclaims a remilitarisation of Germany by means of the creation of a-,national military force.5. The problem of the security of the Federal Territory presents itself inaddition from an internal standpoint. Up to now the Federal Government has hadno appropriate force at its disposal for the maintenance of internal order in the face of the fifth column and against encroachments by the Volkspolizei and the F.D.J.The case might very well arise where the Volkspolizei, following the Korean pattern,might begin overt or covert action against Western German territory. Should theAllies be for any reason unwilling in such a case to commit their own forces it wouldbe the task of the police force (Schutzpolizei) to intervene against these acts to thebest of their power.The Federal Government, therefore, proposes for its part to set up at theFederal level a police force of a strength sufficient to offer a guarantee of internal security.The Federal Government is in no doubt that such a police force can only beestablished by means of a constitutional amendment. The Government is preparedto present an appropriate Bill to the legislature forthwith. It must, however, pointout that a period of several months would elapse before the Bill became law. Asadvance preparations must start at once it is necessary that the Allied High Commis-sion should issue a directive to the Federal Government to take the requisite steps for the creation of this police force.
The democratic control of this police force should be guaranteed bythe formation of a committee of members of the Bundestag, who would be given theright to supervise the establishment and the manning of the defence police.International control of this police force might be undertaken by the military security Board.First memorandum from Dr. Adenauer referred to in Wannerheide telegramNo. 1304 dated 2nd September, 1950Your Excellency, 2nd September, 1950.In amplification of the memorandum which I addressed to the High Commis-sion on 29th August, 1950, and in connection with the discussion on the Petersbergon 31st August, 1950,1 now have the honour to inform you of the following detailswith regard to the organisation, number and armament of the Defence Police(Schutzpolizei) requested by the Federal Government:  -1. The Schutzpolizei shall initially consist of 25,000 men, to be called togetherat once. A second phase shall quickly follow this first step when furtherSchutzpolizei formations shall be established, bringing the total strength to a totalof 60,000 men. Any further increase in this number would take place in agreementwith the Allied Powers in accordance with the development of the situation.2. The central control of the Federal Schutzpolizei shall be in the hands ofthe Federal Chancellor or of an official appointed by him. Recruitment shall beon a voluntary basis. So far as possible the senior and medium posts are to be filled by experienced police officers. The legal position of the members of thisSchutzpolizei will be regulated as was that of the Schutzpolizei of the WeimarRepublic.3. All formations of the Schutzpolizei are to be housed in barracks and are tobe armed with automatics, light and heavy machine guns, hand grenades andmortars. They will also have light armoured vehicles and pioneer units with appropriate equipment. They shall be fully motorised so that adequate mobility isfissured(Signed)        ADENAUER.His ExcellencyChairman of the Allied High CommissionM. Andre Francois Poncet,Bonn, Petersberg.Second memorandum from Dr. Adenauer referred w in Wahnerheide telegramNo. 1304 dated 2nd September, 1950Your Excellency, 2nd September, 1950.Latest information indicates that the present policy of the Soviet Union istending towards allowing the Volkspolizei of the apparently independent SovietZone Republic to force its way into the territory of the Federal Republic at an appropriate moment. Mayor Friedensburg, who visited me yesterday and whoenjoys numerous connections with the Eastern Zone, confirmed this view from hisown observations.Accordingly I am now renewing the request which I made at our last meetingat the Petersberg, that the Allied Governments should formally assume the responsi-bility vis-a-vis the Federal Government to oppose with Allied&apos; Forces any attack bythe Volkspolizei on West German territory and Berlin, even if the Soviet union should have given the Republic of the Soviet Zone an apparently independent statusin international law and if the Soviet Union itself refrains from participation in anyventure by the Volkspolizei.Such a declaration would be a great reassurance for the German population and would also contribute to an improvement in civilian morale. At the same timesuch a declaration would also have a deterrent effect upon those in power in theEastern Zone and upon the forces which stand behind them.(Signed)        ADENAUER.His Excellency.-&apos;  Chairman of the Allied High CommissionM. Andre Francois Poncet,Bonn, Petersberg. -
