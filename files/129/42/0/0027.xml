In the Session which liesbefore you the necessary increases in production for defence will call for increasedefforts and sacrifices, but I am confident that with the unfailing support of all my loyal subjects the nation will be enabled to play its full part in the defence of freedom and the preservation of peace.In Korea an armed force is for the first time resisting aggression under the flagof the United Nations. The success of this historic action in which My forces are playing a gallant part marks a decisive moment in world affairs, and is arousingfresh hopes of the unification of Korea and of a lasting settlement of the Koreanproblem. It has already given proof of the ability of the United Nations to meet an armed threat to world peace.My Government also support strongly the efforts of the Specialised agencies of the United Nations to render technical assistance to impoverished or backwardcountries in order to improve their standard of living.My Ministers in the United Kingdom will maintain the closest relations withthe other Governments signatory to the North Atlantic and Brussels Treaties.They will continue to work with these Governments to strengthen the north atlantic Treaty Organisation, to improve the defence of the North Atlantic area,and thus to achieve security against aggression.My Ministers, in consultation with other Commonwealth Governments, willgive further study to plans for promoting the economic development of South andSouth-East Asia.My Government will continue to devote their attention to the development ofthe Colonial Territories and the welfare of their peoples, and will introduce legis-lation to supplement the sums made available for these purposes by the colonial development and Welfare Act, 1945.I look forward with great pleasure to the forthcoming visit of Queen Juliana ofthe Netherlands and Prince Bernhard.Members of the House of Commons :The Estimates for the Public Services will be laid before you in due course.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :The Queen and I are glad to know that preparations are going forward through-out the United Kingdom for the Festival of Britain, 1951, which will demonstrateto the world the greatness of British achievement in art and science and in their application to industry and agriculture.
