if his DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 24124TH OCTOBER, 1950COPY NO.169CABINETTHE BRITISH SUGAR corporation memorandum by the Minister of FoedAt the Cabinet&apos;s meeting yesterday (C.M.(50) 67th Conclusions,Minute 6) I was invited to report on the extent to which the proposednationalisation of the British Sugar Corporation was necessary in order tosecure a revision of the existing Sugar Refining Agreement.Z, My view is that this factor, though important, is not one whichshould be decisive one way or the other in our consideration of the questionof nationalising the Corporation.     I have never urged nationalisation forthe primary purpose of securing a revision of the Agreement,     The funda-mental reason for public ownership is, in my view, to get rid of private capital and private influence in the Corporation which is solely an instrument of Government policy.3. I have, however, considered the anxieties of the Cabinet on thelegal effect of the nationalisation proposals on the Sugar Refining Agreement,and have taken such advice as I could, including that of the Attorney-general who will no doubt give his opinion personally to the Cabinet.     It is clear from this legal advice that the transfer of the shares of the Corporation to public ownership would not bring the Sugar Refining Agreement to an end.4. The present Sugar Refining Agreement can therefore only be endedeither by a specific provision in the nationalisation legislation, or byagreement between the reconstituted Board and the refiners.5. We could include a provision in the legislation terminating theAgreement from a stated date, but this would almost certainly involve com-pensation to the refiners.     The quantum of compensation would depend onthe difference between the present Agreement and whatever revised arrange-ment was negotiated;   it is impossible at present to estimate the measure ofthis.6. The question of compensation would be avoided if there were no specific provision in the legislation, and if the reconstituted Corporation were left to negotiate a new Agreement.     Clearly the reconstituted Board would bein a stronger position to negotiate with the refiners than is the present Board,on which the Government directors are in a minority.     But if it proved impossible by negotiation to replace the present Agreement by a more satisfactory one, we should have to consider imposing a settlement.7. My advice is that we should forthwith decide in principle to proceedwith nationalisation.     We should leave over for further examination thequestion of providing for the abrogation of the present Agreement in the nationalisation legislation with a view to the submission of definiterecommendations on this point to the Socialisation of Industries Committee.Ministry of Food, S.W.1, M.W.24TH OCTOBER, 1950.
