(50) 177).H. G.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,21th October, 1950.ECONOMIC report . Man-PowerAfter being relatively stable in recent months, the working populationincreased by 72,000 in August, owing to the normal heavy intake of school leaversat the end of the summer term.2. Over the past year, there has been a decrease of 57,000 in the strength ofthe Armed Forces and Women&apos;s Services and an increase of 206,000 in civil employment. Manufacturing gained 161,000 and distribution gained 60,000. Thenumbers in public administration fell by 27,000 and in coal mining by 23,000.3. The number of persons unemployed in Great Britain at 11th september was 284,000 compared with 288,000 in August and 268,000 a year ago. Unemploy-ment in Development Areas is much the same as it was a year ago.II. Production4. The volume of industrial production in the second quarter of the year was per cent, higher than in the corresponding period of 1949. The chief contributionto this increase came from manufacturing industries, where the engineering and vehicles trades alone accounted for one-third of the increase. In the first two monthsof the third quarter, the level of production fell appreciably owing to annual holi-days, but nevertheless it remained well above the level achieved in the correspondingperiod in 1949.39499 b

In September 1949 it was 132.Coal5. During September and the first three weeks of October, the output of deep-mined coal averaged just over 4 million tons a week, that is, less than one-half of1 per cent, higher than in the corresponding period in 1949. Output for the first42 weeks in the year (up to 21st October) amounted to .163 - 3 million tons, anincrease of 1 - 8 million tons over the corresponding weeks of last year.6. Up to the end of the third week of October, the output of open-cast coalamounted to 10,273,000 tons, compared with 10,340,000 in the correspondingperiod of last year. During recent weeks output has been consistently below lastyear&apos;s levels, largely owing to the accumulation of rain on the sites, and it is forthis reason that the total output for the year so far has now fallen behind thatof 1949.7. The number of wage earners on the colliery books has been falling at therate of 2,000 a month since the beginning of the year. The output of deep-minedcoal, however, has been maintained by an increase in output per man-shift and adecrease in absenteeism. In the third quarter of 1950, output per man-shift was per cent, higher and absenteeism 4 per cent, lower than in the third quarter of1949.8. At tbe middle of October distributed stocks of coal were 15 -1 million tons,as against 16 - 5 million at the corresponding date last year.9. Exports of coal, which averaged 303,000 tons a week in the first half ofthe year, have fallen to a weekly average of 206,000 tons in the period since theend of June.Steel10. The output of steel ingots and castings in September averaged 326,000 tonsa week. Total output for the first nine months of the year was just over 12 million tons, 41 per cent, greater than in the first nine months of 1949.11. Output of pig iron in the third quarter of 1950 averaged just under 180,000tons a week against 181,500 in the third quarter of 1949. The total for the first nine months of the year was 7 -1 million tons, which was equal to the output in the firstnine months of 1949.12. Stocks of pig iron and scrap reached their highest levels since 1947 in the summer months of this year.. In July, stocks: of scrap reached 907,000 tons, but fellsharply in September to 812,000 tons.Textiles13. In July and August, owing to holidays, textile production fell from thehigh levels achieved earlier in the year; nevertheless output in all branches exceptwoven wool fabrics remained above the output for the corresponding dates in 1949.The output of cotton and spun rayon and mixture yarns in the third quarter of theyear was nearly 255 million lb. against 241 million lb. in- the third quarter of 1949.The. returns so far available for woven cotton and rayon fabrics show similar gains.In July and August the output of worsted yarn amounted to 35 -1 million lb; against31 9 million lb. in July and. August 1949. In the same months, however, wovenwool fabrics were down from 67-6 million square yards in 1949 to. 67-3 million square yards in 1950.1950140140130
Motor Vehicles14. Output of passenger cars and commercial vehicles fell in August owingto holidays, then rose again in September. In the third quarter, production of passenger cars was 25 per cent, higher and of commercial vehicles 19 per cent,higher than in the third quarter of 1949.15. About one-fifth of the cars and just over one-third of the commercial vehicles were produced for the home market. These proportions have been approxi-mately maintained since the early part of the year. Last year one-third of the car sand one-half of the commercial vehicles produced were for the home market.Merchant Shipbuilding16. The tonnage of merchant shipping under construction in British shipyardsat the end of September was 1 - 8 million gross tons. There has been relatively little change in the position throughout the year. The proportion of shipping being builtfor export has shown a slight increase in recent months, having gone up from 36 percent, at the end of April to 42 per cent, at the end of September.17. The tonnage of vessels undergoing repair and conversion in British portsremained steady at about 2 - 6 million gross tons in the first six months of the yearbut by the end of September it had declined to 2 - 2 million gross tons.III.-Building18. The number of new permanent houses completed in Great Britain fellfrom 17,013 in July to 14,945 in August and then rose to 17,398 in September. Thetotal for the three months was almost exactly the same as in the preceding quarterand 7 per cent, higher than in the corresponding quarter of 1949.IV.-External Trade19. Both imports and exports declined in September. In the case of importsthis continued a decline which has been in progress since June; exports, on the otherhand, had reached a record level in August.20. The figures for the third quarter show a continued growth in exports, buta fall in imports from the high second quarter figure. As a result the adverse balanceof trade fell considerably.Visible Balance of Trade (  million)	Exports		and	Imports	re-exports	Balance(c.i.f.)

The drop in vahie of imports from the second to the third quarter tookplace in spite of an increase in the prices of goods imported, particularly of rawmaterials. The volume of imports was considerably below that of the second quarter. . &apos;22. The growth in value of exports was due in part to a rise in prices butmainly reflects an increase in volume. There has not been any further expansion in metal goods exports (though these have maintained the very high figures reachedearlier in the year); the growth has been in exports of textiles and other manufac-tures, and in re-exports.

For the first time since devaluation the dollar value of exports to theUnited States exceeded the figure for the first quarter of 1949. Re-exports of wooland rubber to the United States have also been high.V. Balance of PaymentsGold and Dollar Position23. As announced early in October the sterling area gold and dollar surplus in the third quarter amounted to $187 million compared with $180 million in thesecond quarter and $40 million in the first.24. In the second quarter a number of special and temporary factors (forexample, large dividend and insurance receipts) helped to swell the surplus. these were much less in evidence in the third quarter; on the other hand there werelarger earnings from United Kingdom exports and rest of sterling area raw materialsales, and towards the end of the period the beginnings of an influx of funds fromthe dollar area stimulated by rumours of currency revaluation. This movementcontinued in the early part of October, but has now subsided. Most of theinflow is thought to represent cover for genuine commercial requirements in thefuture, but its full extent and character are not yet completely known.United Kingdom Balance of Payments25. In the first half of this year the United Kingdom is provisionally estimated to have had a surplus of  52 million in its balance of payments with the rest of theworld (Cmd. 8065). This is made up of a deficit of  52 million with the dollar area and a surplus of  104 million with the non-dollar world. In the second half of 1949an overall deficit of  54 million was compounded of a deficit with the dollar area of 160 million and a non-dollar surplus of  106 million. It will be evident from thesefigures that the improvement is entirely with the dollar area. Within the non-dollar area, however, our position with O.E.E.C. countries showed a big favourable change,offset by some deterioration with the rest of sterling area, where we have beenfacing the full effects of the rise in raw material and other prices.Summary of Regional Deficits and Surpluses in the United Kingdom current account( Dollar areaNon-dollar area Other Western HemisphereO.E.E.C..........-Other non-sterling ...Rest of sterling areaOther .......total all countries1949    ^ 19501st half . . 2nd half 1st half-142 -160     :      - 52-i- 27 -h 20 - 2+ 11 - 29 4- 51-12 -   3 - 204-135 4-120 4 80-3 -   2 - 54- 158 -I-106 -I-104-r 16 - 54 4- 52
26. Since the end of June United Kingdom exports have increased still further and there was a slackening in the increase of imports. This suggests that the overall surplus has recently been running at a rate a good deal higher than in thefirst half year.VI. prices import and Export Prices27. The index of import prices (1947 = 100), having risen from 110 in Sep-tember 1949 to 132 in May 1950, remained at 132 in June but since then hasresumed its rise, reaching 135 in August and 137 in September. The index of export prices (1947=100), which was 113 in September 1949, rose to 119 in June1950 and to 121 in July, at which figure it has remained in August and September.Wholesale Prices28. The Board of Trade&apos;s index of wholesale prices (1938=100) rose from252 in June to 260 in August and 268 in September. The whole of the increase from June to September arose from a 10 per cent, rise in the prices of industrial materials and manufactures, the index for food and tobacco having fallen. Themost striking increases have been in imported materials, especially wool (49 percent, rise between June and September), non-ferrous metals (15 per cent.; tin alone30 per cent.), and rubber (67 per cent.).Retail Prices29. The interim index of retail prices (June 1947=100), which stood at 114from April to July, fell to 113 in August and rose again to 114 in September. Thefall in August was caused mainly by substantial reductions in the price of potatoes,apples and oranges, and the rise in September by increases in the prices of butter and bacon. Though the index for all items together stood at the same level inSeptember as in April, there have been changes in the components: the indicesfor clothing, fuel and light and household durable goods have risen, the index fordrink and tobacco has fallen (owing to the improvement in the quality of beerresulting from the last budget), while the indices for food, rent and rates and miscellaneous goods are at about the same level as in April. On present informationit is expected that the index for October will be 115 and that it will rise to 116 by december.VII. Retail Sales and Stocks30. Sales both of large-scale retailers and independent shops fell less inAugust this year than August 1949. Total sales of the large-scale shops were 13 percent, higher in value than last August, all the main categories of goods showingsubstantial increases. The independent traders also had higher sales, though the increases were generally smaller.31. The stocks of large-scale retailers (the only group for which information is available) no longer showed at the end of August the same excess over last year&apos;s figures as was noted three months ago. Total stocks of non-food goods were only 8 per cent, higher in value than in August 1949. Figures of sales by whole-sale textile firms indicate lower purchases by retailers, and the wholesalers havebeen accumulating stocks.VIII. Wage Rates32. The Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of weekly wage rates (June 1947=100)continued unchanged at 110 in September. It has remained at this figure since january 1950.33. During July, August and September the increases in weekly full-timewages amounted to  87,000,  42,000 and  75,000 respectively. Over the first nine months of 1950 the average increase of wages has been even smaller than thatof 1949.

The fall of one point in the Interim Index of Retail Prices from July to august carried with it a reduction in wages in the iron and steel industries, whosesliding scale moves at each point change in the index. With the subsequent rise ofone point from August to September this reduction will now be reversed.35: The National Reference Tribunal for the Coal Mining Industry hasawarded a &quot; global increase &quot; of  3,500,000 a year to be distributed in a manner tobe agreed on by the National Coal Board and the Miners&apos; Federation. By adecision of the Agricultural Wages Board the minimum rate of wages of maleagricultural labourers is to be raised from 94s. to 100s. a week. The Road HaulageWages Board has made a proposal for an increase of 7s. per week in the wages of road haulage workers.36. A number of new wage claims have been presented since June, affectingparticularly workers in food manufacturing and allied industries and in local govern-ment service. It is understood that the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union isabout to present a claim for an increase in the wages of dock workers.37. Important claims still under consideration include those of the engineering and shipbuilding workers, the railwaymen, omnibus workers, clothing tradeworkers and clerical workers in Government employment.IX. European Recovery ProgrammeEuropean Payments Union38. An agreement for a European Payments Union on the lines described inthe last Report (CP. (50) 177, paragraph 42) was formally signed in the Councilof the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation on 19th September inParis, and a Management Board was set up. In the case of Switzerland, formaladherence was reserved pending ratification by the Swiss Federal Parliament which took place on 25th October. At the same time the Economic Co-operation Adminis-tration undertook to earmark $350 million, to be made available in portions as required towards the working capital of the Union, and in addition $100 million forspecial assistance in cases of difficulty.39. The first E.P.U. operation has been carried out in respect of the threemonths July to September 1950. The United Kingdom surplus for this period with europe (excluding Switzerland) was  34 - 3 million. After allowing for the use of sterling balances by other countries to meet deficits with the Union, the amountof the United Kingdom surplus which goes to reduce our initial dollar balance withE.P.U. and against which we receive conditional dollar aid was  28 - 5 million.Liberalisation of Trade40. Member countries agreed, within 15 days of signature of the agreement for a European Payments Union, to notify to the Organisation measures of liberal-isation covering at least 60 per cent of their imports on private account from allother Members in the three groups of food and feeding-stuffs, raw materials and manufactured goods counted separately. The statement submitted by the UnitedKingdom showed that as at 30th September, 1950, the United Kingdom hadextended open general licences to all other Members (except Switzerland, see para-graph 3^above) over items representing 84 per cent, of our general trade on privateaccount (on the base-year 1948) subdivided as follows:  Per cent.Food and feeding-stuffs     ...      .........      ...      80Raw materials        ...      ...      ......      ...      ...      91Manufactured goods ...      ......      ...      ...      80
41. The Organisation is now studying the steps by which participating countries may advance towards the 75 per cent, stage of liberalisation. certain countries, for example, Denmark and Holland, have indicated the difficulties whichmay impede them in going beyond the 60 per cent, stage already reached, whileother countries, for example, France, have stipulated conditions that must besatisfied if they are to reach 75 per cent, on a firm basis. It will be seen from theabove figures that the United Kingdom has already easily surpassed the 75 percent, stage.E.R.P. Appropriation42. The E.R.P. Appropriation for 1950-51 was included in a general UnitedStates Appropriations Bill which was signed by President Truman on 6th September,1950. The amount to be appropriated was made subject to certain reductions to bedetermined. The total sum for E.R.P. now announced by the United States bureau of the Budget, is to be $2,200 million (that is, $900 million less than the amountoriginally requested by the Economic Co-operation Administration). The economic co-operation Administration have meanwhile intimated that the division ofMarshall Aid among the participating countries is to be made in the existing pro-portions for the first half of the fiscal year (1st July, 1950-30th June, 1951) and ona basis to be decided for the second half. In the case of the United Kingdom it now seems possible that no further allotment of E.R.P. funds will be made after thecurrent half-year in view of the rise in our gold and dollar reserves, and that anyfurther aid will be considered in relation to the Mutual Defence Aid Programme.The amount so far allotted to the United Kingdom for the first half of 1950-51is $175 million, as against the revised figure of $900 for 1949-50.
