HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y &apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET .  .C. P. (50) 203 COPY NO^ x8TH SEPTEMBER, 1950CABINETEMPLOYMENT OF NATIONAL SERVICEMENMemorandum by the Secretary of State for WarThe extension of National Service to two years revives thequestion of where National Servicemen may be employed.   Until the questionof providing and maintaining a force for Korea arose, National Servicemenhad not been debarred from serving wherever Regulars were employed.National Servicemen have, in fact, been sent wherever it is economicalto do so during their eighteen months&apos; service, including Malaya and HongKong.2. In principle, I consider that it would be highly undesirable to establish a precedent which suggested that National Servicemen could notbe used on active service.   Obviously the maintenance of such a rule wouldbe quite impossible in the event of a major war and it would, I think, be wrong even in the case of relatively minor hostilities.3. The proper policy is to maintain the traditional rule ofthe British Army, namely, that men should not be sent into action until theyhave reached the age of nineteen years and have had adequate training.It was with reference to this rule that the Minister of Defence, in the recentDefence Debate, pointed out that few if any National Servicemen would besent to Korea since, on the basis of an eighteen months&apos; service, it was almost impossible to send men of over nineteen years of age without cutting down their period of active service in Korea to an impossibly short period.The Brigade being prepared for Korea in the United Kingdom has,therefore, been formed on an all-regular basis, involving a heavy call onthe Regular Reserve.4. The situation has been greatly changed by the proposal toextend the period of National Service to two years.   If and when parliament has passed the necessary legislation to give effect to this proposal, it willbe possible to send National Servicemen, fully trained and over nineteenyears of age, to Korea, for they will stiiThave some twelve to thirteenmonths of effective service to do.5. Moreover, it has already been necessary to send someNational Servicemen to Korea.   These are the men serving with the two battalions who have already gone from Hong Kong.    It would have disruptedthese battalions to have removed the National Servicemen of over nineteenyears of age from them and would have made the despatch of the battalionsto Korea impossible.   Accordingly, with the concurrence of the Ministerof Defence, the National Servicemen who were fully trained and over

9nineteen years of age have gone to Korea with their units.   Care has,of course, been taken not to anticipate the will of Parliament, and men have not been sent to Korea whom it would be impossible to bring back tothis country in order to meet their existing date of release from the active Army after eighteen months1 service.6. The Cabinet are now asked to agree that, in principle, the rule should be that men, whether National Servicemen or Regulars, shouldnot be sent into action   before they have both reached the age of nineteenyears and completed adequate training, and that there should be nodifferentiation between the employment of National Servicemen andRegulars.7, The Secretary of State for Air, with whom I have discussed the matter, is in agreement with this recommendation.J.S.War Office, S. W. 1. ,8TH SEPTEMBER, 1950.Malaya has never been counted as &quot;action&quot; in the sense of actualwarfare such as is taking place in Korea and it is proposed to continuesending National Servicemen there as heretofore.
