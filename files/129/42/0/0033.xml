THIS   DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1950CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 3 2CP. (50) 233\6th October, 1950CABINETEFFICIENCY AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE SOCIALISEDINDUSTRIESMemorandum by the Lord President of the council at their meeting on 27th April (CM. (50) 26th Conclusions, Minute 8), theCabinet approved in principle the general proposals in regard to the socialised industries which I put forward in CP. (50) 60, and agreed that the socialisation of Industries Committee, in the light of the Cabinefs discussion, should decide uponthe manner in which the need for some checks on efficiency should be discussed with the Chairmen of the Boards.2. The Socialisation of Industries Committee have had two meetings with the chairmen and gone thoroughly over the ground. We found that we were sub-stantially in agreement on every point except the question of continuing arrange-ments for reviewing the organisation and management of the Boards. Inparticular (a) The Chairmen agreed with the steps which the Government were taking toincrease the opportunities for Parliamentary discussion, notably theprovision of three extra days during the present Session for debatesabout the socialised industries. They said that they welcomed Parlia-mentary discussion because it helped them to keep in touch with current criticisms and gave them the opportunity of explaining their point of view through Ministers.(b) They shared our opinion that it was important to develop good public relations in the fullest sense of the term. It was agreed that it wouldbe useful to arrange a meeting between the Directors of Public relations of the Boards and Government information officers who were specially concerned with the socialised industries. The interchange of views and experience should be mutually advantageous, and it might be founduseful to make a regular practice of meeting from time to time. Iunderstand that the first of these meetings will be taking place shortly.(c) The Chairmen concurred in the proposal that there should be periodicalenquiries into broad questions of policy and structure connected withthe socialised industries. They thought, however, that seven-yearintervals were the least that should be envisaged.We also had a useful interchange of views on the working of the consumers&apos;consultative machinery and on relations between the Boards and the workpeople.3. The Chairmen were divided on the question of continuing arrangementsfor reviewing the organisation and management of the Boards. At the firstdiscussion the Chairmen of the Airways Corporations said that they would beprepared to accept a management advisory service, either appointed by the Boardsjointly and responsible to them, or with a semi-independent position under the aegis of an outside body of recognised status such as the British Institute of management. Lord Hurcomb (British Transport Commission) was opposed to acommon advisory service of any kind, but suggested that our purpose might besecured by the appointment, if necessary with the approval of Ministers and on the39483
advice of the British Institute of Management, of a panel of consultants to whomthe Boards could turn when they needed outside help. Lord Hyndley (national coal Board), Lord Citrine (British Electricity Authority) and Sir Edgar Sylvester(Gas Council) were opposed to any formal arrangements.We hoped that, on thinking matters over in the light of the discussion, the chairmen might change their minds, but at our second discussion it proved other-wise, and they maintained the views they had previously expressed.4. In the hope of finding a way out of the deadlock, I subsequently saw LordHyndley and asked him to discuss with his colleagues how far I could go in any statement to Parliament about their views on the subject. I have now heard from lord Hyndley that Lord Hurcomb, Lord Citrine, Sir Edgar Sylvester and he areprepared to agree to it being publicly stated that all the Boards are anxious con-continually to increase the efficiency of management in their industries, and to thisend (i) are using and will continue to use the help of outside consultants; and(ii) are members of the British Institute of Management or will become members.The Chairmehs agreement is on the understanding that (i) does not imply theconstitution of a panel, to which they see &quot; the strongest objection.&quot; They alsoconcur in the proposal to make provision for independent enquiries into the socialised industries &quot; at fairly long intervals.&quot;5. The attitude of the Chairmen is based upon the view that to assign evenadvisory functions to a body external to a particular Board would be a reflectionupon the Board&apos;s competence. They also argue that there would be an irresistibledemand that any reports from such a body should be published to Ministers and toParliament, and that, whatever its formal status might be, it would develop into an organisation for supervising the way in which they discharged their statutoryresponsibilities and for drawing public attention to what an irresponsible group of experts regarded as defects in their management.6. I do not agree that these consequences would necessarily follow, and I stillthink that there is a good case on grounds of efficiency and public accountability for setting up some common management advisory service. At the same time, Iunderstand the Chairmehs apprehensions, and a body which they were forced to setup against their better judgment would suffer from such a serious handicap thatits usefulness might well be destroyed from the start. It would also be unfortunate that there should be public disagreement between the Government and the Chair-men on this single issue when we are at one on the other points.7. In these circumstances, the Socialisation of Industries Committee came tothe conclusion that, if the Chairmen were prepared to go as far as we now under-stand from Lord Hyndley to be the case, it would be better not to pursue thematter further for the present. We remain free to reopen it later, and it may bethat, in the light of further experience, the Boards will come to realise for themselves the advantages of common arrangements.8. A number of Government supporters are anxious that there shall be a debate on the public accountability of the socialised industries, and, as at presentintended, this will take place on 25th October. I would propose to deal with thesubject on the general lines already agreed by the Cabinet, covering such matters asParliamentary discussion, public relations, consumer protection, and joint con-sultation with workers as well as the question of external checks on the Boards. I ask the Cabinet in particular to agree now (i) that I should take the opportunityof announcing the intention of holding periodical enquiries into broad questions ofpolicy and structure connected with the socialised industries, and (ii) that I should explain that the Boards are using and will continue to use the help of outside con-suitants as intimated by Lord Hyndley.It is proposed that the Minister of Fuel and Power should wind up the debatefor the Government.H. M.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,16th October, 1950.
