this  document  is  the  property of his  britannic   majbsty&apos;s   governmentPrinted for the Cabinet:  September 1950SECRET Copy No.32CP. (50) 206\2th September, 1950CABINETOVERSEAS OPERATIONS (SECURITY OF FORCES) bill memorandum by the Home Secretary1. At their meeting on 25th July, 1950 (CM. (50) 50th Conclusions, Minute 5),the Cabinet agreed that a Committee of Ministers should revise the draft of the overseas Operations (Security of Forces) Bill in the light of the Cabinefs discussion and should arrange for further consultations with the Trades Union congress general Council, so that if legislation were required at short notice in the ensuingmonths a Bsill likely to command general support could be introduced in Parliament.2. The Committee, under the chairmanship of the Lord President, have accordingly reviewed the draft Bill which the Cabinet had before them(CP. (50) 185), and I now circulate a revised draft Bill designed to strengthen thelaw relating to sabotage and to make provision for punishing acts likely to prejudice the operations overseas of His Majesty&apos;s forces or forces associated with HisMajesty or to assist persons Opposing those operations.3. Preliminary conversations have been held with representatives of theTrades Union Congress General Council on the provisions of the Bill relating tothe conduct of persons who take part in, or incite others to take part in, strikes,but the representatives consulted were not in a position to give any firm view asto the attitude of the Council. The Committee accordingly decided to defer anyfurther approaches to the Trades Union Congress until the revised Bill had again been considered by the Cabinet.4. The attention of the Cabinet is called to the following matters which raise questions of policy and principle:  (i) The long title of the Bill now refers to &quot; any occasion when His Majesty&apos;forces or any associated forces are engaged or may shortly be engagedin operations outside the United Kingdom involving the use of force.&quot;This expression is considered to be preferable to that used in the draft ofthe Bill which the Cabinet had before them, namely, &quot; during any period when His Majesty&apos;s forces or any associated forces are engaged or about to be engaged in operations outside the United Kingdom involving the use of force.&quot;(ii) The preamble to the Bill, using the same words as are used in the longtitle, makes clear the circumstances in which the Act can be broughtinto effect. The relevant Words are &quot; to enact measures, on any occasionwhen His Majesty&apos;s forces or any associated forces are engaged or may shortly be engaged in operations outside the United Kingdom involving the use of force, for preventing interference with and conduct to the prejudice of such forces and for preventing the assistance of personsopposing such operations.&quot; ;s(iii) Clause 1 has been amended so as to provide that an Order-in-Councilbringing the Act into operation shall continue in force for a period notexceeding twenty-one days and shall then expire unless an affirmative39334   :
resolution has in that period been passed by each House of Parliament.The period of twenty-one days runs when Parliament is adjourned orprorogued and it follows that, if an Order is made during an adjourn-ment or prorogation, Parliament must be reassembled for the purpose of,, passing the necessary resolutions. If Parliament has been dissolved, theperiod of twenty-one days begins with the date fixed for the first meetingof the new Parliament.An Order, once approved by both Houses of Parliament;, continuesin forces for six months but can be prolonged for; further periods, eachnot exceeding six months, if both Houses of Parliament presentAddresses praying for its continuance.(iv) Clause 2 has been amended so as to do away with intent and to make theacts specified in the clause offences if they are designed or likely to bringabout any of the mischiefs contemplated by the clause and if they are committed without reasonable excuse. The effect of Clause 2 as nowdrafted is that, while it remains incumbent on the prosecution to prove that the accused committed the acts alleged, they will not be required to prove intent, and it will be for the defence to prove that the accused hada reasonable excuse for committing the acts alleged against him. Itshould be observed that in its new form the clause will render liable topunishment a person whose acts or omissions are due merely to careless-ness or stupidity or disobedience to orders, but proceedings can be instituted only by the responsible executive authorities (viz., the attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions in England andWales, the Lord Advocate in Scotland and the Attorney-General inNorthern Ireland).(v) Subsection (5) of Clause 2 has been amended so as to give protection onlyto persons who take part in a lawful strike arising out of a dispute between employers and workmen. Participation in a lawful strikearising out of a dispute between workmen and workmen is not protected.It is not easy to find any justification for stoppages arising out of disputesof this kind during periods of national emergency; while, on the otherhand, it would not be too difficult for ill-disposed persons to work up a genuine dispute, for example, over some demarcation question, between two unions.Persons who incite to a strike are not given specific protection, butas a matter of practical politics it will be very difficult, once a lawfulstrike arising out of a dispute between employers and workmen hasoccurred, to prosecute either those who have incited it or those whoare taking part in it, even if the effect of the strike is to impede militaryoperations, &amp;c.(vi) The Committee have given a great deal of consideration to the questionwhether special provision should be included in the Bill for dealingwith subversive publications. They have come to the conclusion thatit is desirable that a special clause should be inserted in the Bill andthat reliance should not be placed on the provision in Clause 5 (1), themain effect of which is to make punishable incitement to commit anyof the offences created by Clause 2. The Committee have consideredthe provisions contained in the Defence Regulations during the last war, but have not been able to follow any of these closely, since thepresent situation differs from that obtaining during the war.The object of the Committee has been to devise some clause which,while not penalising legitimate criticism of Government policy, wouldmake it an offence to carry on propaganda which is intended eitherto prejudice the operations of our Forces or those of our associatesor to assist the opponents of such Operations.Two alternative versions of Clause 3 have been included in the revised draft Bill. The first requires the prosecution to show an intent to prejudice the carrying out of operations, &amp;c, but, once that intenthave been proved, the systematic publication of statements or matter,orally or in writing, likely to prejudice the carrying out of- such operations, is an offence.The second alternative does not require the prosecution to showintent but, in order to safeguard legitimate criticism, it provides thatit shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence to prove that
