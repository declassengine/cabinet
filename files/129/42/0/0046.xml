(50) 24630th October, 1950CABINETTHE FINANCE OF defence memorandum by the Prime MinisterTwo memoranda are being circulated to the Cabinet: (a) A joint memorandum by the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer on the Finance of Defence (CP. (50) 247).(b) A memorandum by the Minister of Defence covering proposals by theChiefs of Staff on the Size and Shape of the Armed Forces over thethree years 1951-54, on the basis of a defence expenditure during thatperiod of approximately  3,600 million (CP. (50) 248).2. The Defence Committee considered these memoranda on 25th October.The primary purpose of that discussion was to settle the line which the Ministerof Defence should take at the meeting of the North Atlantic Defence Committeein Washington, opening on 28th October, which was to discuss a target plan for thedefence of the North Atlantic Treaty area in 1954 (&quot; The Medium-Term DefencePlan &quot;). The Defence Committee agreed that it was important that the Ministerof Defence should be able to give a firm lead to his North Atlantic Treaty colleaguesby indicating the additional defence effort which was being planned by this countryand the practical steps which were being taken to achieve it. At the same time itwas necessary that he should avoid committing His Majesty&apos;s Government finallyto the full programme of  3,600 million until agreement had been reached betweenthe North Atlantic Treaty countries on the United Kingdom share of the collective defence plan and on the distribution of the economic burden between the north atlantic Treaty countries.3.  The Defence Committee accordingly reached the following conclusions:  &quot; (1) Approved the broad outline of the proposals put forward by the Chiefs ofStaff * as the appropriate distribution between the Services of a defence effort of  3,600 million over the three years beginning 1st April. .1951.(2) Authorised the Service Departments and the Ministry of Supply to makedetailed plans on the basis of (1) above and, subject to normal inter-departmental consultations, to place further orders or take such other action as might be needed to create or maintain adequate productivecapacity or otherwise to ensure the fulfilment of the programme, it being understood that the commitment of the United Kingdom to thefull programme of  3,600 million would be dependent upon severalfactors, including, in particular, agreement on its share of the collective defence plan and the distribution of the economic burden between theNorth Atlantic Treaty countries.(3) Authorised the Minister of Defence to state at the forthcoming meeting ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Defence Committee in Washington that theseproposals represented the planned defence effort of the United Kingdomover the three financial years 1951-52, 1952-53 and 1953-54, subject tothe proviso in (2) above.&quot;4. I invite the Cabinet to endorse these conclusions and also to approve therecommendations in paragraph 30 of the memorandum by the Foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (50) 247).C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,30//? October, 1950.* Set out in the Annex to CP. (50) 248.39561
