(50) 2192nd October, 1950CABINETREPORT ON COMMONWEALTH TOUR, JULY AND AUGUST 1950Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations . In the Spring of this year I received invitations from the Prime ministers of Australia and New Zealand to visit their countries and, with the Prime ministers approval, I accepted.2. I left Britain on 7th July and arrived back on 6th September. I travelledto New Zealand via Canada, where I stayed for three days in Ottawa and a day inWinnipeg; I spent two weeks in New Zealand and four in Australia and returnedhome via Ceylon where I stopped for four days. I also had a day in Fiji on the outward journey and a day in Bombay on the return journey.3. All this travelling (over 24,000 miles) was done by air and all by Common-wealth airlines British Overseas Airways Corporation, Trans-Canada Airlines,British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines, Tasman Empire Airways, Air Ceylon, AirIndia and British European Airways. In addition, I travelled within New Zealand1,100 miles by air and 1,400 by car, and within Australia 14,000 miles by air and 500by car.   Altogether, I covered about 41,000 miles.4. In Australia, New Zealand and Ceylon I was a Government guest. TheGovernments of Australia and New Zealand went to great trouble and considerable expense to ensure that I saw as much of Australia and New Zealand, met as many people, and saw as many aspects of their life and work as was humanly possiblein the time available. The resulting itineraries were somewhat exhausting, butthey were well planned and well balanced. The Australian Government put a specially fitted Dakota at my service during the whole trip. New Zealand lent mea Dove for the necessary flights.5. Both New Zealanders and Australians have an insatiable appetite forspeeches, and though a large proportion of my time was spent in remote areas and did not involve attendance at public gatherings, this was more than made up for inevery civic centre that I visited; and in six weeks I made thirty-five speeches inaddition to a number of broadcasts and press interviews.6. The main points that I would like to draw to my colleagues&apos; attention areas follows:  Relationship to Britain7. Both in Australia and New Zealand there is a genuine friendship andaffection for Britain. Naturally, this was to be expected at the more formalmeetings and receptions I attended; but I also found it in many casual contacts thatI made.   I return with no doubt that it is both widespread and profound.8. There is, however, a distinction between New Zealand and Australia. in new Zealand the love of Britain is practically unqualified. Almost everyone refers to England as &quot; home.&quot; I ihink we can count on the continuance of this feeling fora very long time. It will, incidentally, be fostered by New Zealand&apos;s resentmentat the rather off-hand manner of her big neighbour. When we disagree with39417 copy No,  ^ ...
Australia, New Zealand is inclined to side with us. In Australia there is a certainsensitivity and touchiness underlying her feeling for Britain; a certain impatienceand readiness to find Britain at fault or weak; a certain desire to be &quot; Australian &quot;rather than British. From all accounts, these tendencies were much stronger inthe years between the wars. Britain&apos;s stand in the war powerfully restoredadmiration and affection for us. Our hold over Australia^ loyalty and respect will depend upon our capacity to show vigour and leadership in the world&apos;s affairs. Iwas,.personally, surprised at the extent to which people in Australia do speak of britain as &quot;home&quot;; but I have no doubt that we must reckon upon a gradualdisplacement in the next generation of British patriotism by Australian patriotism.9. We cannot ignore the danger that Australia (but not, I think, New Zealand)will be drawn into the American orbit of civilisation. This has happened to someextent in Sydney, though I think only superficially. The danger is not great, partly because of the vast size of Australia and the detachment of the various States fromone another; what happens in Sydney has surprisingly little effect upon Adelaideor Perth.The States10. One of the things I learned in Australia was the (to me, surprising) extentto which the States are separate, independent and jealous of one another. In thelong run the real power will pass to the Federal Government: already the essentialsteps have been taken through the transfer of certain taxing powers to the centre(including customs and income tax). Nevertheless, the States will long and perhapsalways retain their touchy independence and cling to their powers. These are veryconsiderable indeed; so considerable that, under the Australian Constitution such things as planning, price-control and planned capital development are almost impossible to carry out, save in war-time. Another war would see a furtherconsolidation of central power; but short of that (and even in spite of that) we mustreckon on a long continuance of State independence. Although State powers havenot quite such thorough-going legal protection under the Constitution as in theU.S.A., the Australian State is a much more self-centred and independent affairthan a State in the U.S.A.11. The United Kingdom&apos;s relations with Australia are, of course, conducted in the main with the Commonwealth Government who are responsible forAustralians international relations, but there are certain specified fields, e.g., honoursand the appointment of Governors, about which the State Government corresponddirect with the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, and certain of the governors still send to me regular reports about the affairs of their States for submission to the King. The States cling with jealously to their direct connectionwith the Crown and with Britain. I was surprised at the extent to which StatePremiers regard their independence as being bound up with their relations with theCommonwealth Relations Office. It is well worth making the most of this and itis certainly important that we should keep ourselves informed of political andeconomic affairs and the development of public opinion in the States; feeling on many issues differs from State to State and opinion in the States very often differsconsiderably from opinion in official circles in Canberra. I am arranging for regular reports to be sent by our High Commissioner about the affairs of the States.We must, I think, cultivate the State Premiers rather more than we have in the past and encourage them to visit London more often. I propose also to try to establishsomewhat closer relations with the Agents General of the States in London. Theoffice of Agent General is regarded as a plum and great intrigue goes on to secure it.12. This is connected with the important question of State-Governorships.There has been a certain tendency, particularly in Labour-controlled States, toappoint Australian Governors. There are at. the moment Australian Governorsin Queensland, New South Wales and Western. Australia. There are EnglishGovernors in South Australia, Victoria; and Tasmania. The Governor-General isat present, of course, an Australian.) I was much impressed by the; way in Whichthe Australian-born Governors carried out their duties, by their lively recognitionof their duty as the King&apos;s representative; and by their maintenance of the dignityproper to their office. 1 We need not fear that the. tendency to appoint AustralianGovernors implies any, diminution of Australians loyalty to the Crown,
13. Nevertheless it is, I think, important that Governors from; the UnitedKingdom should as far as possible be appointed, and I was pleased to receive fromthe Premier of Tasmania, after my return from Australia, a request for anotherGovernor from this country for his State. These appointments help to keep alivethe particular attachment to Britain. It is also much better for the working ofParliamentary democracy in the States to have independent Governors above thepolitical battle. Owing to the close party balance in most States, Governors have often to make very difficult decisions about dissolutions and the like. Where thereare Australian Governors there is always the danger that the appointment will form part of some complicated manoeuvre or intrigue (there is, I was told, such amanoeuvre on foot in Western Australia). This must both diminish respect for theKing&apos;s representative and still further lower the standard of State politics.14. It seemed to me that there is a fair chance of a gradual return to thepractice of appointing British Governors. We must take very great pains over these appointments, particularly in associating the State Premiers with our choice.It is they who decide whether there shall be British or Australian Governors, andthe more they really share in the selection the more inclined will they be to ask forBritish Governors. It may be that to find the right men for Governorships we shallhave to cast our net somewhat wider than in the past.Appointments for Australians15. From talks I had with Governors, Premiers and the Prime Minister, Iam sure that we could do a good deal to divert the general touchiness of Australiansand to weaken the desire for Australian Governors if we were, from time to time,to appoint an Australian to some post of importance in the Commonwealth and empire. We could, for instance, sometimes make an Australian a Governor ofa Colony or appoint one to a military command. Menzies spoke with some bitter-ness of what he described as the War Office refusal to believe that there were any able Australians; he told me that General Freyberg had similar feelings. I donot think there are very many Australians in the first rank; but there are some.It is certainly true that an occasional appointment of an Australian would have verybeneficial effects upon Australian opinion.Political Parties16. In New Zealand, although there are sharp differences between the parties on the domestic front, there is very close co-operation between Holland andPeter Fraser in foreign affairs. The Prime Minister shows the Leader of theOpposition all important papers on foreign policy and defence and constantlyconsults him. We need not fear that defence arrangements that we make with thepresent New Zealand Government will be endangered by a change of Government.17. We cannot be quite so sure in Australia. The Australian Labour party has always tended to put the immediate defence of Australia first and to looksomewhat askance on any doctrine of the strategic primacy of the Middle East.Menzies, who has now committed Australia to acceptance of this doctrine, does notconsult Chifley at all on such matters. I suggested to him that he should considerstarting such consultation.( 18. Both in Australia and New Zealand there is a tendency for Labour Partypeople to say that, if there were Labour Governments in power, Britain would bemore generous in her price negotiations. Holland is himself inclined to believe this, though Menzies, after his trip to London, feels complete confidence in andgreat respect for the Labour Government (greater I suspect than for our Conserva-tive leaders). I did my best to correct with vigour, both in public and private,the idea that party considerations enter into Commonwealth relations. I pointedout to Menzies that quite a few of his political supporters disparage Britain undera Labour Government. He said he was aware of this and deplored it; he attributedit to Evatt&apos;s previous boasting that only under Labour Governments could Australiaand Britain be really close. Menzies said he would do all in his power to checkthis tendency in his supporters.;: 19., The general level of the political parties in Australia and New Zealand isnot very impressive. In both countries the parties are tied very closely indeed to direct vested interests.  This may be because there is little middle class in either39417 B 2
country and practically no educated or cultured middle class. The two LabourParties are almost exclusively Trades Union parties, and make little attempt toinclude in their ranks a crossrsection of the nation. Moreover, they have taken the caucus system to absurd lengths. In the same way the other parties tend torepresent exclusively the interests of big business and agricultural producers. Thisis worse in Australia than in New Zealand owing to the existence in Australia ofa Country as well as a Liberal Party, each directly representing a vested interest.The Country Party refuses to look beyond the immediate and short-sighted interestsof the primary producers. The Liberal Party is a caricature of our conservative party.Political Leaders20. Apart from Menzies and Holland themselves, I was not much impressed bythe Ministers I met. In Australia, Holt, the Minister of Immigration, seems themost promising and the probable successor to the leadership of the Liberal Party.(I was told that Harrison, who is deputy leader of the Liberal Party, had beensent to London to clear the way for Holt.) McEwen, Minister of Commerce and agriculture, is the best of the Country Party, and a great deal better than its leader,Fadden. I thought Casey had gone off very much: he seems to be generally regarded as a spent force.  Spender struck me as erratic and unreliable.21. In New Zealand, Holyoake, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister ofAgriculture, seemed to me outstanding. Doidge is a man easily influenced andunsure of himself and very much under Holland&apos;s influence. Holland himself hasno interest in foreign affairs and no knowledge of them: he is, however, preparedto accept our lead in all important matters. As he told me when I was seekinghis views on a rather complicated matter of foreign policy, &quot; If Mr. Attlee thinksso, it&apos;s all right with me.&quot;Political Prospects22. In both countries the Labour Party seems in good heart. Many of themspeak with some confidence of winning the next election (the interval betweenelections is three years). Both Chifley and Fraser speak with more caution and do not seem at the moment to count on winning before the election after next.Playford, the Liberal Premier of South Australia and a man of sound judgment,told me that he expected Labour to win the next Federal Election. On the whole the international situation has helped the parties in power. In Australia thepresent strong feeling against the Communists has put the Labour Party into some difficulty. Labour voters are to a very large extent Catholic and tend to supportMenzies&apos; onslaught on the Communists. This divides Labour, makes it ratherineffective on a major issue, and leaves the initiative with Menzies. :..Inflation23. By far the greatest problem for the two Governments is the rapid rise of prices. In both countries practically all rationing and all controls have been removed: in New Zealand by deliberate policy, in Australia because the SupremeCourt has given rulings that make Federal controls impossible.24. The fantastic price of wool is, of course, inflationary, particularly inAustralia, where it is a major export. In both countries wages are tied by law tothe cost of living; thus once prices begin to go up, they tend to sky-rocket.25. Both in New Zealand and Australia the Trade Unions have succeeded in slowing up work and reducing hours. The turn-round of ships is now muchslower than before the war and constitutes a major problem. The 40-hour week is very general and strictly enforced in the sense that after 40 hours work stops.(One consequence is that there is not a good hotel in either country.) People inthe countryside are industrious; but in the towns I doubt if enough work is done to sustain the economy or to produce enough goods to check inflation. It seemedto me that, in Australia in particular, a genuine and dangerous inflation had started.This could, of course, cause a fairly rapid reversal of political power. There-is some talk of the Australian Labour Party precipitating ah election in the nextfew-months.by using their majority in the Senate to refuse supply; Their tacticswill depend upon their calculation of the political effects of rising prices.
New Zealand Dairy Prices.. 26. While I was in New Zealand the main topic of talk was the negotiationswith the United Kingdom over dairy prices. After I left the negotiations broke down. There was a short outburst of public anger, in which the Prime Ministerjoined. There is still much feeling, against us for paying other countries higher prices than we pay New Zealand. However, the dependence on the British market and the desire to keep it are very powerful factors and I think the situation willsettle down all right.A ustraiian-British undertakings27. I saw the rocket-range at Woomera. As far as I could judge, good pro-gress is being made. I was impressed both by the co-operation between the Servicesand between Australian and British officers.   Everyone seemed as keen as mustard.28. I was also very favourably impressed by the spirit and achievement ofthe Food Corporation project for raising sorghum in Queensland. The sugarproducers in Queensland all seemed pleased with their contract with us.United Kingdom Offices29. I looked into the working of our High Commissioners&apos; Offices inAustralia, New Zealand, Canada and Ceylon. I have come back with a numberof ideas with which I need not trouble my colleagues. It is essential that our officials, and not only High Commissioners, must do much more regular travellingin the countries to which they are posted. I am making arrangements to secure this. It may be necessary to create an additional post in some of our offices tomake this possible.30. I paid particular attention to the working of our United KingdomInformation Offices. These are of great importance, for the work of maintaining the British connection as each Commonwealth country becomes more self-sufficientand assured will fall increasingly on our offices overseas. Although there are some points where improvements can be made, I was much impressed by the excellentand valuable work being done in New Zealand, Canada and Ceylon. (In Canadawe are developing our work in French, and in Ceylon our work in Tamil andSinhalese.) I was not so satisfied with what I found in Australia and intend tomake changes that will improve our efficiency and stop some uneconomic activity.31. One difficulty in Canada is that any office working from Ottawa is boundto be isolated in so vast a country. I think we must experiment with small infor-mation outposts (consisting of one officer and a secretary). I intend to try one on the West Coast and see whether it is justified by results.Canada32. Although I was only a few days in Canada I was struck by the maturity ofthe country. It has an extremely good civil service and some excellent political leaders. This impression was strengthened by comparison with Australia, whichis a generation behind Canada.33. The aid we gave to help recovery from floods in Manitoba and from firein Quebec was immensely appreciated and will long be remembered.Ceylon34. I need not go into details but, after talks with the Prime Minister andother Ministers, I have come to the conclusion that we must now take a frank and rather tougher line with Ceylon on economic and defence matters. Ceylon is trying to have things both ways, and to get the benefits of Commonwealth associationwithout accepting the responsibilities.Conclusion35. I have no doubt that the sort of visit I made (though very exhausting) is extremely valuable. I personally learned a good deal that I could not have learnedin any other way. It is also important to make the personal acquaintance ofMinisters and other leaders.
36. But apart from that there is very genuine appreciation of visits by british ministers. It will make a lot of difference if visits by various Ministers, especially to Australia and New Zealand, can become a more normal thing.37. I found that there is still great ignorance in Australia and New Zealandabout the nature and problems of the new Commonwealth. I was questioned agood deal about why my Office is now called &quot; The Commonwealth relations office &quot; instead of &quot; The Dominions Office.&quot; Many people seemed to have an uneasyfeeling that the old Empire had been thrown over and very few seemed to have anyunderstanding of the significance of Canada&apos;s role in the Commonwealth or of the significance of the association of the new Members with the Commonwealth. Itwill take a long time to get these ideas across. Without impairing the centripetalforces which must for a long time continue to make the United Kingdom the focalpoint of Commonwealth activity, we must seek to cross-brace the Commonwealthstructure by encouraging much closer relations and a sense of mutual obligationbetween all its Members.38. As countries like Australia grow in power and status, with a consequentgradual weakening of their dependence upon Britain, we must succeed in building up their loyalty to the Commonwealth as a whole.P.
