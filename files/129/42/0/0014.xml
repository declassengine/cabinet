THIS   DOCUMENT IS  THE   PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTRELATIONS WITH THE UNION OF SOUTH africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the accession to power of the Nationalist Party in South Africa after theGeneral Election in May 1948 has made the conduct of our relations with theUnion a matter of some delicacy. As my colleagues will be aware, the nationalist party is Republican and its more extreme elements are anti-British. Althoughthe Nationalists command only a minority of votes in the Union, weightage isgiven to the rural areas from which they draw their support, and with the ninevotes of their allies, the Afrikaner Party, they have hitherto had a majority of sevenvotes in the House of Assembly over the combined forces of the Opposition.Their position has just been considerably strengthened by the elections in South-West Africa in which they have won all the six seats now allotted to that territory in the Union House of Assembly. Though they still do not possess an independentmajority, there seems to be some doubt whether Mr. Havenga, the leader of theAfrikaner Party, who has hitherto been successful in preventing the Nationalistsfrom carrying into effect their policy of reducing the political representation of the cape coloured population and abolishing the three seats for representatives ofthe native populations of the Union, would now be able to rely on the solidarityof his own party should the Nationalists decide to go forward with these measures.By these means the Nationalist Party has consolidated, and hopes still further to consolidate, their hold on the country since the last general election in 1948 andthere seems no likelihood that it will be overthrown in the near future. By contrast,the United Party, now that they have lost Field-Marshal Smuts as well as mr. Hofmeyr, may be unable for some time to produce a first-class leader or a sufficiently challenging policy to counter the Nationalist Party&apos;s appeal to the electorate.2. The feature of the Nationalist Governments policy which has caused the greatest shock in their relations with the rest of the world is their programmeof Apartheid a stiffer form of the traditional South African policy of racialsegregation. Their ultimate objective is the establishment in the Union of a republican, white and predominantly Afrikaner, form of Government which would ensure the domination of the white race and postpone as long as possible, if not for ever, the rise to power of the native population. While the Republican aspect of their policy has recently been in abeyance, the Nationalists are pressing on withtheir racial programme. They have by legislation prohibited marriages betweenEuropeans and non-Europeans, and have now passed the Group Areas Act, 1950,described by Dr. Malan as the &quot; kernel of apartheid,&quot; which extends earlier legisla-tion so as to provide for the segregation of different racial groups of the populationinto defined areas for both residential and commercial purposes. In all this theyhave gone much further than their predecessors, the previous United Party Govern-ment, but much of the strength of the Nationalists is derived from the general support for some form of racial segregation apparent among most sections of thewhite population, including those of British descent.Printed for the Cabinet.

3. Public opinion outside the Union of South Africa is unmistakably hostile to the policies of the Nationalist Government, not least in the United Kingdomitself, where these feelings have recently been expressed in many quarters. Foreigncriticism has been apparent in the United Nations and a similar hostility exists in; the Colonies and in other Commonwealth countries, especially India, Theattitude of India is of particular importance to us at this juncture since we wish to enlist her great influence in Asia to help in the solution of Far Eastern and other problems which are at present major issues in the United Nations. Any suspicion that the United Kingdom sympathised in any way with South Africa&apos;s nativepolicies would so deeply disturb African and Indian public opinion in our african colonies as to constitute a threat to their internal security.Importance to the United Kingdom of good relations with South Africa4. Though there is thus a great deal in the policy of the present South african government with which we in the United Kingdom clearly cannot associate our-selves, it is important for the following reasons that the United Kingdom shouldcontinue to preserve good relations with South Africa:  (i) From the general strategic and defence points of view South Africa&apos;s goodwill is of particular importance to us. If, as seems likely at present, theMediterranean is closed to us in any future war, the naval base atSimonstown, where the South Africans have granted us special rights,will be of vital importance to the Royal Navy, and other South Africanports will be indispensable to our shipping and as staging bases for our troops. Apart from this the Union can contribute considerable militaryforces and we hope shortly to obtain from them a firm commitment tosend trOops to the Middle East in the event of war. The contributionenvisaged would consist of one Armoured Division together with aircraft and naval forces. There are believed to be important deposits ofuranium in the Union and the Union Government have stated that theyhave recently developed processes for its extraction.(ii) The Nationalists are staunchly anti-Communist and Dr. Malan himself hasmore than once publicly pledged South Africa&apos;s support in any warresulting from Russian aggression; he repeated this pledge at Durban on19th September, when he is reported as having said that they &quot; wouldally themselves with the Commonwealth and other like-minded nations of the world in the event of a major war.&quot; The Union Government pro-vided air crews to assist in the air lift to Berlin when it was blockadedby the U.S.S.R., and, despite the unpopularity of the United nations in South Africa, they have now agreed to send a squadron of the SouthAfrican Air Force to co-operate with the United Nations Forces in korea.(iii) South Africa is by far the largest gold producer in the world and it is ofthe utmost importance for the viability of the Sterling Area that theUnited Kingdom should be able to obtain a substantial part of her goldoutput. During friendly discussions with the South African Ministerfor Economic Affairs this summer an agreement was reached whichguaranteed that the United Kingdom will obtain from the Union at50 u least   ^million of gold per annum. South Africa is, moreover, animportant market for United Kingdom exports, and several hundredmillions of pounds of United Kingdom capital is invested there.(iv) The High Commission Territories of Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Pro-tectorate and Swaziland could at any time be economically strangledby the Union Government withholding essential facilities.(v) Finally, we have obligations to South Africa as a fellow-member of theCommonwealth, and even if South Africa decided to become a Republic,we should hope that she would remain with the Commonwealth.Though we have many points of difference with South Africa we havealso many in common and 40 per cent, of the white population is ofBritish stock. The Commonwealth partnership rests on the principleof tolerance; any attempt to secure complete identity of view between all its members would break up the association overnight.5.   In spite of difficulties and differences our relations with the nationalist government have, in practice, been surprisingly good.   Thus we held successful
economic talks with them last summer and prospects for the present defence talksare promising. While we cannot in any way associate ourselves with South Africa&apos;snative policies, our attitude should be explained to the South Africans as clearlyand politely as possible and unnecessary polemics should be avoided. It should,moreover, be remembered that, in general, Nationalist Party leaders are new to office, parochial in their outlook, and without much experience of the outside world.If our relations with them are carefully handled there is some reason to hope thatthey may gradually modify their extrefner views in response to world opinion. Thisis more likely to happen if we for our part show in our dealings with them thatwe appreciate the problems confronting them and do not simply adopt an attitudeof condemnation.6. Against this background we now have to consider the United Kingdom&apos;policy in dealing with the specific issues of the treatment of Indians in South africa and the question of the Union Governments Mandate for South-West Africa, bothof which are once again on the agenda of the forthcoming session of the united nations General Assembly.7. The treatment of Indians in South Africa-This is a problem of longstanding, but the present quarrel between the Union Government on the one handand the Governments of India and Pakistan on the other originated with the asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act, 1946, which was passed byField-Marshal Smuts&apos;s United Party Government. This Act restricted the ownershipor occupation of residential property by persons of Asian descent in certain areas.The Nationalist Government have extended these restrictions and applied them tothe occupation of property for trading purposes as well as for residence. Indiansare also affected by the other recent Apartheid legislation mentioned in paragraph 2providing for the segregation of racial groups and the prohibition of &quot; mixedmarriages.&quot; The Union Government claim that these are all matters of domesticjurisdiction with which the United Nations and other Governments have no rightto interfere. These &quot; Indians &quot; are of course South African citizens who would notbe happy if they were &quot; repatriated &quot; to India. The United Kingdom Governmentobviously cannot support the Union Governments policy on the treatment of citizens of Indian origin. In the past, when the matter has been considered by theUnited Nations, we have maintained an attitude of strict neutrality and avoidedbeing drawn into the merits of the dispute. It is recommended that, at this sessionof the Assembly, we should continue the same policy, avoid taking part in the debate and attempt to exercise a conciliatory influence from the background. We shouldabstain from voting on any Resolution against South Africa of a strongly condem-natory character. The question last came before the General Assembly in 1948 andthere is no likelihood that further discussion at Lake Success will lead to any usefulresult. Even the Indians realise this. As regards Pakistani attitude, Sir ZafrullahKhan told me the other day that his Governments general relations with SouthAfrica were good and that, while the Pakistan Delegation would have to vote infavour of previous Resolutions, they would cause as little trouble as possible at theAssembly over this problem. He did not think there was any solution to the matterand the sooner it could be dropped the better. Pakistani attitude over South-WestAfrica is similar.8. South-West Africa. The recent Advisory Opinion of the international court of Justice on this subject is briefly to the following effect:  (i) South Africa is not obliged to submit a Trusteeship Agreement for South-West Africa.(ii) The status of the territory remains the same as was laid down by theoriginal League of Nations Mandate of 1920.(iii) South Africa is under an obligation to transmit reports and petitions on south-West Africa to the United Nations, which the Court regards as having inherited the rights of the League of Nations in this respect.The Foreign Office Legal Advisers endorse the legal correctness of (i) and (ii) but have expressed doubts concerning the soundness of (iii). It is recommended, how-ever, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should support the Courts Opinion as a whole(without actually endorsing its legal correctness).  The arguments for this are:  (a) It is our policy to support the authority of the International Court andto accept its Advisory Opinions.39380 - b 2
(b) Whatever the strictly legal position, there is a strong case on moral andpolitical grounds for the continuance of the same sort of international supervision in respect of South-West Africa as existed under the Leagueof Nations.(c) Failure to support the Courts Opinion as a whole, including the part aboutthe submission of reports and petitions to the United Nations, would encourage other parties to contest the section of the Opinion favourable to South Africa on the question of submitting a Trusteeship Agreement.If, in the face of the Courts Opinion, the South Africans should persist in refusing to submit reports and petitions to the United Nations, it is likely that they will find themselves completely isolated at the Assembly and, for the reasons mentionedabove, we ourselves in that event would be unable to give them any support. Thisis a position which we are most anxious if possible to avoid. On the recommenda-P^Uo-^tsJr+fj tion of the Raa^^Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, therefore,and with the concurrence of the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for theColonies, the Prime Minister recently sent a message to Dr. Malan (copy annexed),the object of which was to attempt to persuade the Union Government to agreeto act in accordance with the Courts Opinion as a whole, on the understandingthat reports (and by implication also petitions) submitted to the United nations would be deal with by the latter under a procedure conforming as far as possible with the procedure of the former Mandates Commission. The adoption of sucha procedure would in itself accord with the Courts Opinion, which states:  &quot;The degree of supervision to be exercised by the General assembly should not therefore exceed that which applied under the Mandates System,and should conform as far as possible with the procedure followed in thisrespect by the Council of the League of Nations. These observations are particularly applicable to annual reports and petitions.&quot;At the same time Mr. Attlee&apos;s message will serve to warn Dr. Malan, as courteouslyas possible, that if he refuses to make any concession over submitting reports, &amp;c,the United Kingdom Government will not be able to give South Africa any supportat the General Assembly of the United Nations. Although the message made itclear (see paragraph 2 (c) and paragraph 5) that we considered that the CourtsOpinion should be taken as a whole, partly for reasons of tactics, the question ofpetitions was not specifically mentioned, but when the point arises we propose, ifnecessary, to explain to the South Africans that under our proposals we should expect them to transmit petitions as well as reports to the United Nations. ThePrime Minister has not yet had any reply from Dr. Malan. We know that. willbe very difficult for him to accept our suggestions since he and his colleagues havealready committed themselves publicly against sending reports to the united nations. I have myself talked to Dr. Geyer, the High Commissioner for the Unionof South Africa in London, and strongly pressed on him the importance of SouthAfrica accepting the Courts Opinion and sending reports to the United Nations.Meanwhile, we cannot decide on the details of our policy and tactics at the united nations at least until we have had Dr. Malan&apos;s reply. It may be that there willbe several draft Resolutions on this subject before the General Assembly, in which case our line would be to back the least violent that supported the Courts Opinion.If some Members of the General Assembly should seek to enforce on the union the sending of reports and petitions to the United Nations without giving her thebenefit of the reservations quoted above regarding the procedure which shouldbe followed and the degree of supervision to be exercised, the United kingdom delegation should do their utmost in that case to secure that the Assembly itself,as well as the Union, accepts the Courts Opinion as a whole.9.   Conclusions. In the light of the above considerations my conclusions inregard to our relations with the South African Government are:  In general (i) We clearly must not associate ourselves with South Africa&apos;s nativepolicies and apartheid, which are repugnant to public opinion in thiscountry, but we should state our own attitude as politely as possible and thus avoid antagonising South Africa. At the same time we should attempt, in concert with the older Commonwealth countries and theUnited States, to exercise a moderating influence on disagreements
between South Africa and other parties, ensuring that we do not act alone as a mediator in these disputes.(ii) We should do all we can to retain South Africa as a member of theCommonwealth preferably as one owing direct allegiance to theCrown.On the specific issues before the General Assembly (iii) We should remain neutral and avoid being drawn into the merits of thedispute over the Indians in South Africa, and(iv) We should continue to bring pressure to bear on the Union Government toact in accordance with the Advisory Opinion of the International Courtof Justice on South-West Africa and, again in concert with the Common-wealth Governments and the United States, attempt to secure agree-ment if possible between the Union Government and the united nations General Assembly.10. The Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of State have seen this memorandum and are in general agreement with what is proposed.P. C. G.-W.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,25th September, 1950.ANNEXTelegram to Dr. Malan from Mr. AttleeFollowing for Prime Minister from Prime Minister:-United Kingdom Government have been considering recent Advisory Opinionof. International Court of Justice on South-West Africa. Situation arising therefromin forthcoming session of United Nations General Assembly is bound to be most difficult and delicate and I feel I should acquaint you with our present ideas.2. Greatest difficulty is likely to be caused by opinion of Court that UnionGovernment is under obligation to submit reports to United Nations. While UnionGovernment objections to this course are understood, I feel I should warn youfrankly that United Kingdom Government would see great difficulty in supporting the Union Government should latter feel themselves unable to take any actionto conform with Courfs Opinion.   Reasons for our view are as follows:  (a) We are on principle anxious to uphold authority of Court and have welcomed its increased use recently, e.g., in case of human rights in hungary, Bulgaria and Roumania and on competence of general assembly in admission of new members. Even though in present case we realise that some of Courfs Opinions are open to question, we would generally be disinclined to do anything to call in question authority of court. Further strong argument for upholding authority of Court inthis case is desirability of inducing members of General Assembly tothink along legal rather than political or emotional lines.(b) Whatever the strictly legal position, we believe it would be wrong andcontrary to principle of international Mandate to take unilateral actionwhich would have effect of denying any international interest in South-West Africa.(c) Opinion of Court should in our view best be taken as a whole. Satisfactoryfeature is majority Opinion that Union Government are not obligedby United Nations Charter to negotiate Trusteeship Agreement for south-West Africa. We fear that failure on part of Union to acceptOpinion as a whole would encourage Assembly to reopen this issue,on which Court pronounced only by narrow majority in favour of SouthAfrica, and to persist as strongly as ever in demanding that South-WestAfrica should be placed under trusteeship.(d) We believe that arrangements are possible whereby your Government could accept substance of Court&apos;s Opinion while at the same time avoiding
more objectionable features of United Nations methods of dealing withearlier report submitted on South-West Africa. These arrangements are outlined below.3.   Page 138 of the Court&apos;s Opinion reads:  &quot;The degree of supervision to be exercised by the General assembly should not therefore exceed that which applied under the Mandates System: and should conform as far as possible to the procedure followed in thisrespect by. the Council of the League of Nations.&quot;Main points of difference between Permanent Mandates Commission andTrusteeship Council would seem to be as follows:  (a) Commission normally worked in private though it had right to operate in public if it so desired.(b) Members of Commission were not Government representatives (althoughthe Commission throughout included a British subject) and could notbe connected with national delegations.(c) Comments of Mandatory Power might accompany Commission^ reportto the League Council.(d) Commission sent no Visiting Missions to Mandated Territories.4. We would earnestly suggest for consideration of your Governmentpossibility of agreeing to some arrangement whereby ad hoc committee of inde-pendent experts might be set up to receive reports on South-West Africa operatingas closely as possible on lines of the Permanent Mandates Commission. ThisCommittee would doubtless report to Fourth Committee of Assembly, but latter should have no more rights in this case than Council of League and Union shouldnot be called upon to report in any different manner from previous procedure under Mandates system. If it were felt, however, that it would be preferable notto increase number of U.N. bodies already existing, it would be worth considering whether reports might not be received by a sub-committee of one of existing U.N.bodies or by an existing U.N. body itself under strict proviso that procedurefollowed in any such body conformed as closely as possible to that of permanent mandates Commission.5. Arrrangements on these lines would in first place involve agreement byother parties to act in accordance with Advisory Opinion of Court as a whole andwould therefore entail dropping of ;demand made at all previous sessions ofGeneral Assembly that South-West Africa should be placed under trusteeship.Agreement of Union to accept international supervision to extent provided for under League of Nations Madate would be best answer to any allegations that international status of territory is being altered by Union legislation as has beenalleged, for example, in case of South-West Africa Affairs (Amendment) Act, 1949.Moreover, arrangements on these lines in accordance with Court&apos;s Opinion would strengthen authority of Court and help to wean General Assembly away frompurely political or emotional approach to this problem and induce them to dealwith it in future on more sensible and dispassionate legal basis. I would emphasise that it would not be necessary to accept the validity of the Courfs Opinion ascorrect or binding, but rather to consent to take action in conformity with it provided the General Assembly also agree. If this arrangement can be established as we believe is possible without embarrassments that attended consideration of earlier report by Trusteeship Council, I am sure that necessary concession of agreeing to submit reports on this restricted basis would help greatly towardssettlement of this difficult problem. If events proved that critics of Union werenot prepared to accept Courfs Opinion on question of negotiation of trusteeship agreement, then clearly South African position would be greatly strengthened.6. I should let you know frankly that, if in face of Courfs Opinion UnionGovernment should still feel obliged to persist in attitude of complete refusal tosubmit reports, United Kingdom Government themselves, for reasons given inparagraph 2, would find it impossible to continue that measure of support whichwe have hitherto been able to give Union in this matter. In that event we are most gravely concerned lest Union may find itself in dangerously isolated position at United Nations, and I need hardly say how anxious we are to avoid this. I earnestly hope, therefore, that you will be able to give favourable considerationto our proposals coming as they do from a friendly Government which has always
endeavoured in the past to give you such assistance as we could in this most difli-cult problem. If you feel able to accept proposals on these lines it goes without saying that the United Kingdom Government will do their best to persuade others to support them. :      &apos; -7. I realise that elections are now proceeding in South-West Africa and arelikely to make it difficult for you to engage yourself publicly at this stage to agreeto any arrangement for submission of reports. I hope nevertheless that it will mean-while be possible to avoid any statements likely to increase difficulty later on of coming to an arrangement such as I have proposed. Naturally we for our partwill avoid any public disclosure here at present stage that we have made any approach to you whatever on this subject and will treat as most strictly confidentialany interim reply which you may feel able to send me in answer to this telegram.
