THIS   DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT 4     4jSm   t5   M%.Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1950SECRET Copy No.     32CP. (50) 23216th October, 1950CABINETLEASEHOLD reform memorandum by the Lord President of the Council and theLord chancellor in February 1948 a departmental committee was set up to consider., thesubject of leasehold reform. In March 1949, the committee submitted an InterimReport on the tenure and rent of business premises and in June 1950 they submittedtheir Final Report. These reports were not agreed documents, and there wereminority reports and reservations.2. The King&apos;s Speech at the Opening of the present Parliamentary Sessionpromised that, on receipt of the Final Report of the Committee, the Governmentwould consider what amendments should be made in the law about residential and business premises. The subject came before the Lord Presidents Committee on23rd June (L.P. (50) 9th Meeting, Minute 1) and 14th July (L.P. (50) 12th Meeting,Minute 1) and the Committee accepted a proposal by the Lord Chancellor thattemporary legislation should be introduced to deal with current cases of hardship,pending consideration of the difficult and complicated subject of permanent legislation.3. The Lord Chancellor brought the draft of a temporary Bill before theLord Presidents Committee on 13th October (L.P. &quot;(50) 16th Me&apos;meeting, Minute 1),and the discussion showed that Ministers were not agreed on the scope of theBill, or on the best way of dealing with the problems involved. It was accordinglyagreed that we should circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet, setting forth thequestions which must be decided before legislation can be prepared.4. The Committee discussed the prior question whether it was desirable tointroduce temporary legislation at all, or whether it would be better to wait untilpermanent legislation could be prepared. It is not easy to get authenticatedinformation about the extent of the current hardships, and whether they are of avolume which would justify the introduction of emergency legislation with the dislocation which this will cause and the prejudice which it may introduce in reaching a final settlement on leasehold reform. On the whole, the Committee felt thattemporary legislation should be introduced and we invite the agreement of our colleagues to this conclusion. If there is to be temporary legislation it ought tobe introduced soon after the beginning of the new Session, and time is already very short.A. Residential Premises5. It is in connection with the residential part of the Bill that the lord presidents Committee found difficulty in deciding the questions involved. Thereare several separate topics on which decisions must be taken.  1 hey are as follows:  (a) Is the legislation to extend to all leases, or only to leases of premiseswithin the Rent Acts (i.e., premises having a rateable value not exceeding 100 in London and  75 in the provinces)?(b) Is it to extend only to leases entered into before the war or is it to extend to all leases regardless of the date on which they were entered into?39495 b
(c) Whatever the decision on (b), is the legislation to cover certain tenancieswithin the Rent Acts limits which are deprived of the protection of theActs merely for technical reasons?(d) What rent is the tenant to pay during the period after the original termof his lease has expired?ie) What is to be done about the tenanfs covenants and in particular hisrepairing covenant?if) Under what circumstances (if any) may the owner resume possession of thepremises during the temporary extension?ig) Should the provisions of the temporary Act extend to the Crown?6. Before discussing these separate problems the following observations may prove useful.Preliminary considerations on paragraph 57. It will be remembered that the Rent Acts are based on a &quot; standard rent,&quot; andthe standard is fixed by ascertaining what rent was actually being paid when thepremises were first brought within the Act. In addition to the rent so ascertainedthe earlier legislation (not applicable to houses controlled by the 1939 Act) authorisedincreases for the rise in the cost of repairs and other changes in economicconditions.8. The earliest of the Rent Acts expressly exempted from the operation ofthe Act any premises which were let at less than two-thirds of their rateable value,presumably because it would be unfair to base any standard on such a letting;and this provision has been retained in successive Rent Acts down to the presenttime. Consequently so-called &quot; ground leases,&quot; where the rent paid is less than two-thirds of the rateable value, are excluded from the Acts. It is open to the landlord in such cases to do what he desires with the premises when the leasecomes to an end, and, in particular, to let them at a full rack rent.9. The term &quot; ground lease &quot; is not a term of art in English law and is quiteincapable of definition. This is no doubt because the English law has alwaysacted on the maximum that whatever is affixed to the soil becomes part of the soil.10. If the landlord of a vacant site lets the premises to a tenant for 99 or60 or 40 years in consideration of the tenant undertaking to erect a buildingthereon, it follows, according to English law, that the building as soon as it iserected becomes the property of the landlord, though the tenant has the right to occupy it for the agreed term on paying the agreed rent. No part of the rent canin English law be regarded as specially attributable to the land as opposed tothe buildings, The whole rent issues out of &quot; the premises,&quot; i.e., the land and thebuildings thereon.11. This right of the landlord to use the building in whatever way he likesat the end of the term results in his having to pay death duties on the value of his&quot; reversion,&quot; and, if at the time of death the lease has but a short term to run,the value of the &apos;: reversion &quot; on which duties must be paid approximates to thevalue of the &quot; premises,&quot; i.e., the land and the buildings thereon.12. Both &quot; reversions &quot; and &quot; leases &quot; are of course frequently the subjectof sales, and either may be, and frequently is, the subject of a mortgage.13. A further relevant fact is that although the Leasehold Committee werenot unanimous, all members of the Committee recognised that there are certaininstances in which protection analogous to that afforded by the Rent Acts is justified, i.e., the case of the occupying ground lessee and his sub-tenant.14. Moreover, all of the conflicting Reports proceed upon the basis that if additional security of tenure is given to tenants they should pay &quot; a fair marketrent.&quot; (See, in particular on page 120, the Supplementary Report signed by five members, including Mr. Hale and Mr. Ungoed-Thomas, which advocates securityof tenure for tenants of residential premises at present above the Rent Acts limits.)15. It is inevitable that a Bill dealing with the English law of landlord and tenant will be complicated. At the same time, it is of great importance than any temporary legislation should be as short and simple as the circumstances permit,since, if it is to have its proper effect, it must be capable of being passed withina fairly short time from introduction. For this reason, moreover, we wish to stress the importance of avoiding controversy on any subject which is not of the
first importance. In this connection we see no hope of the Bill passing within areasonable time unless it is so framed as to exclude general amendments of the rent Acts.Question 5 (a): Is legislation to extend to all leases, or only to leases within the rent Acts limits?16. The arguments for and against extending the protection to all residentialleases may be thus summarised:  -(i) It is said that it is both more logical and simpler to extend it to all leasesand not merely to those leases falling within the Rent Acts, and to enact that any lease which terminates during the currency of the Actshould be extended for two years. Moreover, it is said many landlordshave been exploiting the housing shortage and exacting exorbitant rentsfrom tenants who because they have no chance of finding other accommodation have in practice no option but to pay the increasedrent demanded.(ii) On the other hand, it is said that we should not lightly interfere with thefreedom of contract. Leases of premises outside the limits of the RentActs have hitherto subject to the Furnjshed Houses (Rent Control)Act, 1946 been regarded as fit subjects for private contract.(iii) Why, it is said, in a merely temporary Act should we embrace this widetopic?(iv) The Leasehold Committee did not find that there was to any considerable extent evidence of overcharging or of driving harsh and unconscionablebargains. For this reason, it is argued, it is better in this temporarylegislation to confine ourselves to dealing with leases of premises whichcome within the Rent Acts and to give protection only to those cases in which tenancies of premises having a rateable value of less than 100, or  75 as the case may be, are not already protected. No doubtwhen we come to our permanent legislation we shall have to consider this field but there is, it is said, no case for doing so to-day.Question 5 (b): Is legislation to extend only to leases entered into before the war?17. On the question whether the temporary Act should extend to all leasesor only to leases entered into before the war the arguments may be summarisedas follows:  (i) On the one hand, it is said that to confine the legislation to pre-warleases is to make a purely arbitrary distinction. Protection may be needed just as much by those persons who took a tenancy after the war had begun as by those whose tenancy was as a matter of history earlier in date. Surely, so the argument runs, if there is to be a distinctionit should be a distinction based on the circumstances of the partiesrather than on the date of the lease. Otherwise a man who took anassignment of a pre-war lease five years ago would be protected, anda man who took a new lease five years ago would not be protected.(ii) On the other hand, it is said, what is the justification for interfering inthe matter at all unless it is based on a change of circumstances? Theman who entered into a pre-war lease could not possibly have antici-pated what was going to happen, but why should a man who enteredinto a short lease, say for two or three years, in the year 1949 suddenlyfind that the lease might be extended at his option for two more years?All the relevant circumstances were known when such a lease wasentered into; why should we interfere with the conclusion the partiesthemselves arrived at in the light of those circumstances?18. It is, of course, possible that the answer to this question may dependon the answer to the previous question. If the protection to be given by thetemporary Act is to extend to all leases one answer might be given but if it isonly to extend to premises within the Rent Acts another answer might be given.Question 5 (c):   Whether or not distinction drawn between pre-war and latertenancies, is legislation to cover post-1939 tenancies excepted from RentActs protection for technical reasons!19.   There are certain tenancies within the Rent Acts limits, which are deprived of the protection of those Acts merely for technical reasons. First, there are the sub-tenancies where the sub-tenant is protected against his immediate landlord, but39495 b 2
(because the immediate landlord is a ground tenant or the tenant of a house abovethe Rent Acts limits of which he has sublet a part within those limits) the suprtenant will not be protected against the head landlord when the head tenancy comes to an end. Secondly, there are the tenancies where the Rent Acts do not apply at allbecause either the landlord or a superior landlord is the Crown. These gaps in the rent Acts protection have, of course, existed since the 1914-18 war (though tosome extent they have only been revealed comparatively recently by decisions ofthe court); but the present 1&apos;andlord&apos;s market in houses makes them more important than they previously were and it is said that by now they have given rise to gravehardship and serious exploitation.20. If Question 5 (b) is decided in favour of covering post-war tenancies, thetenancies mentioned in paragraph 19 will automatically be protected. Otherwise,the question arises whether they should be specifically covered. This could onlybe done by amending the Rent Acts, and would probably have the result that thewhole subject of those Acts would be open to discussion on the passage of thetemporary Bill. It follows that, unless we are prepared to face such a discussion,either the distinction between pre-war and later tenancies must go or else this special class of tenancies must be left without protection except where they happen to have been created before the war. *Question 5 (d): What rent is the tenant to pay during the period of protection!21. On the question what rent the tenant should pay during the extension ofhis tenancy, the proposals canvassed in the Lord Presidents Committee were thefollowing:  (a) That during the extension the tenant should go on paying the same rent asunder the tenancy.(b) As in (a), but that the landlord should, if he alleges that this rent is &amp;olow as to be unfair, be able to apply either (i) to the county court, or(ii) to a rent tribunal,for the rent to be put up, on the grounds of hardship, to an amountnot above a specified ceiling, e.g., the rateable value or alternatively the gross value of the property.(c) That the rent to be paid during the extension should be the equivalent ofthe rateable value.id) As in (c), but that either the landlord or the tenant should be able to apply (i) to the county court, or(ii) to a rent tribunal,for an increase or decrease within specified limits on the ground of hardship.(e) That in the ground-lease case any power to increase the rent should belimited by a provision that the tenant should not have to pay more thanthe amount of a present-day ground rent, i.e., that buildings put up dur-ing the tenancy should be disregarded. (We must warn our colleagues that apart from the impossibility of defining what we mean by a groundlease, which would here be particularly embarrassing, there is doubt whether under English law and valuation practice a limitation of thiskind would be workable. It may be that the technical difficulties are lessin Scotland.)22. It was recognised by the Lord Presidents Committee that any such hard-ship test as is mentioned in paragraph 21 (b) and (d) would set the court or tribunala very difficult problem, involving an estimation of the means and needs of the land-lord and the tenant; and that in particular it might involve that adjoining tenants of similar houses, having similar incomes, would be paying different rents accordingto the means of their landlords.23. On the other hand, the right to refer any case to the court or to a tribunal would make it seem clear that justice was being done. The circumstances of one case will differ so profoundly from the circumstances of another case that it maybe necessary, so it is said, to consider each individual case. Moreover, it may wellbe that permanent legislation may have to proceed upon the line of some kind of rent court to determine what rent is fair and reasonable under all thecircumstances.
24. The argument for maintaining the existing rent even though the leasehas come to an end rests in part on the assertion that many tenants who have for years past been paying the ground rent have come to regard the property as theirown that this measure of protection is due to them that the landlord, who hasalready done well out of the premises, should not be allowed to exploit their needs that the tenants, driven by the necessity of their economic circumstances to find somewhere to live, have not been free agents in entering into contracts-and that any less protection than this (i.e., a continuation of the existing rent)would be politically disastrous. Moreover, it is said that the temporary Act merelycontemplates a two years&apos; extension and this standstill will be no great hardship to the landlord.25. On the other hand, it is said that the proposal to maintain existing rentinvolves expropriation naked and unashamed. The hypothesis is that on thetermination of the lease the landlord (or the man who has bought the reversion)has the right under the existing law to let his property for what he can get for it.Can we deprive him of this right and make him content himself with a rent whichmay be far less than reasonable without paying him compensation? When wedealt with title and with development rights we paid compensaton. Is this to bethe first exception? If so it is a singularly bad exception because we are not takingaway the landlords rights for any public purpose, but are merely distributing thoserights to other persons. No doubt we are only doing it for two years, but whenthose two years are over will it be any easier to restore to him his rights by raising the rent than it is to-day? It is no doubt unfortunate that tenants made a mistakein law in thinking that the property was theirs subject to the continuance of pay-ment of the ground rent; but is A&apos;s mistake in law any ground for depriving B ofhis rights without compensation?26. Yet it is surely right that the law should not pay such regard to vestedrights as to cause it to hesitate to prevent exploitation or the driving of harsh andunconscionable bargains, and the shortage of houses makes such exploitationpossible. Can the tenants, it is argued, reasonably ask more than this: that they shall be given the same sort of protection as is given to their brothers who derivetheir protection from the Rent Acts? Consider two similar and adjoining houses in a street. One is protected by the Rent Acts and the tenant is paying X a weekrent. The other has no protection; its occupier was tenant under a ground leasewhich has now expired.  Can it be right that he should pay only  X?27. The advantage of fixing the rent as the equivalent of the rateable value is that you roughly equate the position of the two houses and in effect fill in thegaps which have been shown to exist in the Rent Acts and give to tenants ofhouses not already protected under the Rent Acts the same sort of protection asthe tenants of controlled premises. Speaking very roughly, the rent payable fora house protected under the Rent Acts where the landlord is responsible for repairsis the equivalent of the gross value of the property for rating. In the case of&quot; ground leases &quot; the tenant is responsible for repairs and it is, therefore, fair thathe should pay a rent equal in amount to the rateable value. It must beremembered that these rateable values were fixed before the 1939 war.Question 5(e): What is to be done about the tenant&apos;s covenants and, in particular,his repairing covenants?28. While in general we feel that the covenants in the lease should go onunaltered, the temporary Act should contain provisions preventing the tenant&apos;s beingdeprived of his protection on technical grounds of non-repair. There is someprecedent in the Leasehold Property (Repairs) Act, 1938; but that Act only applies to houses of a rateable value not above  100. If the Bill covers larger tenancies, itis for decision whether relief from repairing covenants should be similarly widened.On the one hand, there may be the same need to prevent eviction by the landlordwhatever the size of the house. On the other hand, it may be argued that tenants of larger houses are capable of protecting their own interests and ought not tobe excused from carrying out agreements which they have made.Question 5(f): Under what circumstances may the landlord get possession?29. The Lord Presidents Committee were on the whole agreed that the landlord should be allowed some grounds for preventing a tenancy being extended or bringing it to an end before the two years had expired. (It was generally agreed
that the tenant ought not to have an extension put on him against his will.) It isfor decision whether the grounds should be similar to those on which a landlordcan get possession under the Rent Acts or whether for a temporary Bill they shouldbe narrowed (the main grounds under the Rent Acts are: suitable alternative accommodation undesirability of the tenant-requirement for occupation by the landlord or his family and proof of greater hardship-ejectment of a service tenantwhose contract of service has ended to make the house available for anotherservice tenant or ejectment of any tenant to make the house available for an agricultural worker on a certificate of the Minister of Agriculture). The questionalso arises whether, whatever the other grounds are, the fact that building leasesare being brought under control requires that the courts should have discretion to give the landlord possession where the property is required for re-development.Question 5 (g): Should the provisions of the legislation extend to Crown, Ac.,properties?30. It is for consideration how the Bill should affect the Crown, localauthorities, new town corporations and statutory undertakers. The Rent Actsdo not, the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1947, and the Tenancy of Shops (Scotland)Act, 1949, do, bind the Crown; some of the other public bodies mentioned havelimited exemption from the Rent Acts. We feel that in legislation which, in orderto give essential protection to the tenant, pays little regard to the vested rightsof the landlord, it would be difficult to exempt particular landlords, even though they are exercising public functions, to a greater extent than can clearly be shown to be necessary in the public interest. To meet these difficulties provisions were included in the Bill circulated to the Lord Presidents Committee to which some ministers had found it necessary to take exception. A special problem arises inrelation to land belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster,and it was widely felt that such land should not be included in the provisionbinding the Crown.Form of protection31. There is general agreement that the form that the protection should takeis to extend existing tenancies for a suitable period from the passing of the Bill.We suggest two years, in the first instance at any rate, in order to avoid complicationswhich would arise from the interactions of the Bill and the rating revaluation whichwill be taking place about three years from now under the Local Government Act,1948. Presumably the Bill will have to protect not only tenancies which would otherwise expire during the two-year period but also those which have expired inthe immediate past where the tenant has been holding over in the hope of protectinglegislation. It is not, of course, suggested that the protection should be available toa tenant unless he is in occupation of at least a part of the property.B. Shops. 32. The discussion at the Lord Presidents Committee was confined to theresidential part of the Bill, and we believe that there is general agreement (subjectto the question of application to the Crown) on the proposals as to shops in thedraft Bill already prepared. These, in general, follow the Tenancy of Shops(Scotland) Act, 1949, which enables the tenant of shop premises to go to the court and ask for a renewal of his tenancy, for a year at a time, at a rent and on otherterms to be fixed by the court. It seems likely that there will be pressure inParliament to extend the shops provisions to other business premises, and inparticular to offices. The President of the Board of Trade does not consider thatthere is any real need for the inclusion of offices. Presumably the provisions aboutapplication to the Crown, &amp;c, will be the same as for residential premises (seeparagraph 30 above).H. M.J.16th October, 1950.
