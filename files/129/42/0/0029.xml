[HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(50) 229 COPY NO.  3 *V12TH OCTOBER, 1950CABINETOVERSEAS OPERATIONS (SECURITY OF FORCES) bill memorandum by the Lord President of the Council andthe Home secretary at their meeting on 18th September (CM.(50) 60th Conclusions,Minute 2) the Cabinet invited the Lord President to arrange that theCommittee which had supervised the preparation of the draft OverseasOperations (Security of Forces) Bill should consider whether the criminal law could with advantage be strengthened for the purpose of countering a communist conspiracy to foment industrial unrest in this country.A,   Possible Extension of Overseas Operations(Security of Forces) bill. The Committee examined the suggestion, which had been dis-cussed by the Cabinet on 18th September, that any necessary strengthening of the law for this purpose should be secured by an extension of the overseas Operations (Security of Forces) Bill.     We were informed that,-as a matter of drafting, it would be comparatively easy to amend thepresent Bill so as to make it an offence tot interfere with, or incite others to interfere with, supplies or services essential to the life of the nation.But it would hardly be possible to justify extending the Bill in the waysuggested on the ground that the industrial unrest fomented by the communists had interfered with operations in Korea, and any such exten-sion might prejudice the Government^ chances of securing the narrower,and in some respects more reasonable, powers which might be requiredin connection with the overseas operations.     We therefore recommendthat any powers needed to deal with attempts to disrupt the internal economy should be taken in an entirely separate Bill.B.   Scope of Separate&apos;legislation. We are satisfied that public opinion would not be prepared atthis time to support legislation on the lines of that introduced in Australiaand South Africa for the suppression of the Communist party and we have therefore considered whether legislation could be framed to penaliseparticular activities of the Communists in the industrial field.     We thinkthat it would be well to confine the aim of any such legislation to theprevention of strikes in essential services, and, though we recognisethat it is not easy to define what is an essential service, we believe thatif the legislation either left them to be defined by Order in Council orgave power to add by Order in Council to a minimum list set out in theBill the difficulty of definition would not in practice prove insuperable.

There seem to be three possible courses of action, viz.  -(a) Amendment of Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.One possibility would be to extend the provisions of the Conspiracy and protection of Property Act, 1 875, to cover all essential employments andnot merely employment in the gas, water and electricity industries.But the Act of 1875 hinges on breach of contract, and in some essentialemployments - including the gas and electricity industries - many of theworkers are engaged on a day-to-day basis or on contracts lasting onlyfourteen days.    Accordingly, in addition to extending the Act, it mightWell be desirable to ask employers in essential industries to consideradopting the practice of giving the workers greater security of tenure.Where this was done, it would make it less easy for trouble-makers to induce workers to come out on strike when their contracts of service hadexpired, since they would have had much more time for reflection;  butit is understood that in certain essential employments (e.g. docks)long-term contracts are out of the question.(b) Legislation based on the Conditions of Employment and national arbitration Order.    The second course would be to enact in permanentform provisions on the lines of the Conditions of Employment and national arbitration Order, which makes it an offence for an employer to declareor take part in a lock-out or for a worker to take part in a strike inconnection with a trade dispute unless the dispute has been reported tothe Minister of Labour and twenty-one days have elapsed during whichthe Minister has not referred the dispute for settlement by arbitrationor in one of the other ways set out in the Order.     Even if this legislation were confined to workers in essential services it would be open to the objection that, although the Trades Union Congress recently endorsed bya substantial majority the continuance in force of the Order, the Govern-ment have given an undertaking to revoke it if at any time they are sorequested by the two sides in industry.     Moreover, any Bill containingprovisions similar to those in the Order would raise the issue whetherindustrial arbitration was to apply permanently throughout the field ofindustrial relations covered by essential services.(c) Requirement of Ballot.   A third possibility would be to make itillegal to take part in, or incite others to take part in, a strike in anessential service until the members of the trade union or unions concerned had voted in favour of strike action by secret ballot, possibly with postalvoting, conducted under the supervision of their union or unions or theChief Registrar of Friendly Societies.     This would ensure that each ofthe workers was fairly consulted before a decision to strike was taken and would hamper the activities of agitators who often succeed in startingor continuing strikes without proper consultation with the main body ofworkers.     To enable a scheme on these lines to work satisfactorily itwould be necessary to ensure that the trade union machinery operated with reasonable speed.     Moreover, it would often be difficult to defineexactly who should take part in the proposed ballot and the definition ofthis would obviously be of great importance since on it would hang thequestion whether an offence had been committed.     A further difficulty is that the proposed legislation, in addition to penalising prolonged large-scale unofficial strikes, would also cover the minor strikes, generallylasting little zxiore than a day or two and affecting only small numbers ofmen in perhaps a single plant, which frequently takes place.     Any legisla-tion on the lines suggested would be in addition to and not in substitution for any existing restrictions on strikes (e.g. , in the Conditions of Employ-ment and National Arbitration Order), but if a situation arose in which the

workers balloted in favour of action in contravention of the Conditions ofEmployment and National Arbitration Order it might prove difficult to prosecute under the Order.4. We suggest that the three possibilities outlined in paragraph 3should in the first instance be discussed with the Trades Union Congress.We also think that it might be desirable to hold a public enquiry before any legislation is introduced.C. Introduction of Overseas Operations(Security of Forces) Bill5. We have also considered whether in present circumstances the overseas Operations (Security of Forces) Bill ought to be introduced andhave discussed further what should be the form of Clause 3 of the Bill.Against the introduction of the Bill at present it can be argued that there has been no single instance, since the outbreak of hostilities in malaya or Korea, of an attempt to prevent supplies being sent in supportof military operations and that existing powers are ample to deal withdirect sabotage if the offender can be caught.     If the Bill were introduced,Parliament and public opinion would say that the main problem in presentcircumstances was the Communist conspiracy against the maintenance of essential services, to which the Minister of Labour had referred in his statement in Parliament and in his broadcast.     The Government would beasked why it had failed to deal with that situation and had decided to con-concentrate on what would be regarded as a hypothetical risk.On the other hand, it can be argued that experience in France,Australia and elsewhere shows that the Communists will try to impede thedespatch of war materials where this is practicable.     In the presentunsettled state of the world there may have to be further United Nationsoperations directed against aggression and powers should be taken toensure that these operations were not impeded.     In any event, there mightbe a long period of guerilla warfare in Korea during which the communists in this country could become active.We consider that the question whether the Bill should be intro-duced in present circumstances raises difficult points of political judgment on which we cannot make a unanimous recommendation to the Cabinet,though most of us are in favour of proceeding with the Bill.     If the Bill isto be introduced we recommend that there should be prior consultationwith the Trades Union Congress and we also consider that it might bepossible to forestall a good deal of Parliamentary criticism by discussing with the Opposition the need for the Bill.D. Clause 3 of the Overseas Operations(Security of Forces) bill. Alternative versions of Clause 3 were included in the draft Billcirculated to the Cabinet with C.P,(50) 206.     We are agreed that underthe former alternative it would be difficult to obtain convictions and that onlythe   latter would be workable in practice.     We considered further whetherthis alternative might be strengthened if the offence were to assist in pub-lishing statements &quot;with a view to influencing public opinion in a mannerlikely to prejudice the carrying out of operations.....&quot;, fcut we are satis-fied that any such modification would be undesirable.     An ordinary

member of the public ought to be free to say that he thought a certain war was unjustified, and there is in our view a clear distinction between astatement of this kind and measures designed to impede military operationsbeing taken in connection with the war.7. To sum up, our conclusions are as follows:-(1)    Any powers needed to counter Communist attempts to fomentindustrial unrest should be taken in separate legislation andnot by an extension of the Overseas Operations (Security of forces) Bill.     We are not convinced that the case for suchseparate legislation is yet established and in any case before embarking on such legislation it would be desirable to be sure that a very full backing of public opinion would be forthcomingfor it.(Z)     We recommend that the three possibilities outlined in paragraph3 should be discussed with the Trades Union Congress.     Wethink that if there is to be legislation it might be desirablefirst to hold a public enquiry.(3)     The arguments for and against the introduction of the OverseasOperations (Security of Forces) Bill early in the new Sessionare fairly evenly balanced and, though most of us considerthat the Bill should be introduced then, we think that the cabinet will wish to give further consideration to the point.(4)     If it is decided to proceed with the Overseas Operations(Security of Forces) Bill, the Trades Union Congress will haveto be consulted and there might be advantages in discussing with the Opposition the need for the Bill before it is introduced.(5)     The   second of the alternative versions of Clause 3 of the draftBill circulated to the Cabinet with C.P.(50) 206 is preferableand it would be undesirable to add to this version the words&quot;with a view to influencing public opinion in a manner likelyto prejudice the carrying out of operations.....&quot;.H.M.J.C.E.12TH OCTOBER, 1950.
