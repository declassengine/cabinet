FUTURE POLITICAL, SETTLEMENT IN KOREANote by the Prime minister circulate to my colleagues copies of telegrams which I haveexchanged with the Foreign Secretary on the future settlement in Korea,and draw particular attention to the draft resolution contained in telegramNo.  1157 of 22nd September from the United Kingdom Delegation to theUnited Nations.2. The Cabinet&apos;s discussion of 4th September on Korea(CM.(50) 55th Conclusions, Minutes 3 and 4) is relevant to the considera-tion of these telegrams.     In this connection I also circulate ForeignOffice telegrams Nos.  1401 and 1402. of 23rd September to the UnitedKingdom Delegation New York.C.R.A.10, Downing Street, S.W.1,.25TH SEPTEMBER, 1950.ANNEXFROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO NEW YORK(To United Kingdom Delegation to United Nations)No.  135721 st September, 1950.Following from Prime Minister for Secretary of State.The reports from Korea seem to me to indicate the possibilityof the collapse of the North Korean fo r c s o p g rating in South Korea.2. This makes the consideration of what is to happen next a matterof urgency.     I have no doubt that you are giving this consideration.3. It is, I think, important that the United Nations organisation should be considered the deliverer, not the destroyer, of Korea.     Thereis much to be said for some kind of declaration that the United nations organisation will take the responsibility for the rehabilitation of the whole country.     Otherwise the U.S.S,.R. might step in with a view to appearing asthe benevolent restorer of what the United Nations Organisation hasdestroyed.HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 215 COPY NO.    3 225TH SEPTEMBER, 1950CABINET

4. I should imagine that China would not be sorry if Russianinfluence were eliminated from Korea provided that the new regime was&apos;a real United Nations Organisation trusteeship for the eventual freeing of theKoreans.5. I should like to know how your mind is moving on this matter.FROM NEW YORK TO FOREIGN OFFICE(From United Kingdom Delegation to United Nations)No.  115121st September, 1950.Following for Prime Minister from Secretary of State.Your telegram No.  1357.We had already been working on this problem when your telegramarrived but are not yet ready to send you our conclusions.     I hope to be ableto telegraph to you tomorrow.FROM NEW YORK TO FOREIGN OFFICE(From United Kingdom Delegation to United Nations)No.  115622nd September, 1950.My telegram No.  1151.Following for Prime Minister from Secretary of State.My immediately following telegram contains text of draft resolution on Korea which we propose to communicate to United States and Common-wealth Delegations.2. You will see that this resolution makes no mention of a trusteeship.That was what I tried at Moscow in 1943 and it failed.     Though you mentiona United Nations Trusteeship, I do not think this is likely to commend itself,the more so as both North and South Koreans originally expressed theirdislike of a trusteeship until the Kremlin directed the North Koreans to change their tune.3. The really tricky thing is whether the United Nations forces areto go north of the 38th Parallel.     Clearly they must do so if the unification of Korea is to be achieved.     Our resolution seeks to cover this contingency,though admittedly in veiled terms in the first recommendation.4. You will realise that we are not bound by our draft which will beused at this stage for the purpose of consulting with our American and commonwealth Delegations.     The final recommendation in particular will obviously need a good deal of elaboration.     I hope you will agree that it

meets the points which you have in mind apart from the question of trusteeship.     Like you I am impressed by the need for swift a.ction inorder to forestall others and make sure that the Russians do not seize the initiative.FROM NEW YORK TO FOREIGN OFFICE(From United Kingdom Delegation to United Nations)No.  115722nd September, 1950.My immediately preceding telegrams.Following is text:/Begins/.The General AssemblyHaving regard to its resolutions of 14th November 1947, of 12thDecember 1948 and 21st October 1949:Having taken note of the report of the United Nations Commissionon Korea;Mindful of the fact that the objectives set forth in the resolutionsreferred to have not been fully accomplished and in particular that the unification of Korea has not yet been achieved, and that an attempt has beenmade by an armed attack from North Korea to extinguish by force theGovernment of the Republic of Korea;Recalling its declaration of 12th December 1948 that there hasbeen established lawful government (the Government of the Republic of korea) having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of Korea wherethe United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea was able to observe and consult and in which the great majority of the people of Korea reside;  thatthis Government is based on elections which were a valid expression of thefree will of the electorate of that part of Korea and which observed by theTemporary Commission;   and that this is the only such Government in Korea;Bearing in mind that United Nations armed forces are at presentoperating in Korea in accordance with the recommendation of the security council of 27th June 1950 that members of the United Nations furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area;Recalling that a declared objective of the resolutions of theGeneral Assembly referred to was the establishment of a unified, independent and democratic Government in Korea;Recommends (a) that all necessary steps be taken to promoteconditions of stability and security throughout the whole of Korea,

(b) that when su&apos;ch conditions have been created newthroughout the whole of Korea with a view to the establish-, independent and democratic government of all Korea;Resolves that(a) a commission be established consisting of.....,to be known as the United Nations Interim Commission in Korea, to becharged with the task of conducting preliminary discussions with north korean representatives regarding the political future of Korea and inparticular(I) to inform the North Koreans of the intention ofthe United Nations to hold new elections throughout Korea on a national basis with view to the establishment of a unified, independent and demo-cratic government;(II) to inform the North Koreans that any united nations forces entering North Korea would do so for the purpose of main-taining law and order until new elections had been held and a new nationalKorean Government, itself capable of maintaining law and order, established,(b) a commission consisting of.....to be known asthe United Nations Unification Commission in Korea to be established to becharged with the task of supervising new elections to be held throughout thewhole of Korea and to assume the functions hitherto exercised by the presentUnited Nations Commission on Korea, consulting as maybe appropriate withthe Government of the Republic of Korea.     The United Nations interim commission should proceed to Korea as soon as the Commander of theUnited Nations forces in Korea deems that the time is ripe for it to begin tocarry out its functions as set forth above.     The United Nations UnificationCommission in Korea should proceed to Korea as soon as the United NationsInterim Commission on Korea has completed its task.elections be heldment of a unifiedThe General Assembly furthermore,Mindful of the fact that at the end of the present hostilities the task of rehabilitating the Korean economy would be beyond the resources ofwhich Korea itself disposes;Recommends that the Economic and Social Council in consultationwith the United Nations Unification Commission in Korea, should prepare a programme of economic and technical assistance.FROM NEW YORK TO FOREIGN OFFICE(From United Kingdom Delegation to United Nations)No.   117823rd September, 1950.My telegram No. 1157:   Assembly-resolution on Korea.After further consideration we decided that the paragraph dealingwith the timing of the departure of the United Nations Interim Commission

(Resolution paragraph (b), second sentence) gave General MacArthur too much discretion.     We have therefore substituted the following &quot;The united nations Interim Commission should proceed to Korea and begin to carryout its functions as soon as military conditions permit&quot;.     This is theversion which we are now discussing with the Americans.FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO NEW YOR-,(To United    ingdom Delegation to United Nations)No.  140123rd September, 1950.Following for Secretary of State from Makins.Long term political settlement in ;\orea.This matter was discussed at the House of Commons onSeptember 19th by the Attorney and Solicitor-General with the Minister ofState and Sir E. Beckett.2. When this question was before the Cabinet (C.P.(50) 193) therewas a discussion whether Korea could or should be put on the agenda ofthe General Assembly having regard to the fact that under Article 12(i) ofthe Charter the General Assembly is not to make recommendations withregard to a dispute or situation which is on the agenda of the security council unless the Security Council so requests.     The Attorney-Generaland the Lord Chancellor had expressed views on the legal position.     Thesubstance of the Cabinet Conclusion was that there was no objection to your proposals generally and also that it was desirable that cvorea should bediscussed in the General Assembly provided that the Law Officers did notconsider that the legal objections must be held to preclude this.3. The effect of the subsequent discussion with the Law Officers isas follows:-(i)       It is clear under Article 12(i) that the General Assembly couldnot make recommendations on a question if that same question was still on the agenda of the Security Council.(ii)       Because of the obvious dangers of this course iorea should inno event be taken off the agenda of the Security Council merely for the purpose of facilitating discussion in the Assembly.(iii)        Theoreticall v it was possible to divide the Korean question into two parts, (A) &quot;the restoration of peace and security&quot;, and(B) &quot;the future of Korea&quot; assuming that peace and security hadbeen restored;   and therefore it might be held that it waspossible without a breach of Article 12(i) for the Assembly tomake recommendations on question (B) while question (A)remained the affair of the Security Council.4. The distinction in paragraph 3(iii) above is easier to make in theory than to maintain in practice, e. g. the question whether the united nations Forces should go north of the 38th parallel might well appertain

to both A and B.     Further, since Korea is already on the ProvisionalAgenda of the General Assembly it seems certain that discussion willrange over both aspects of the question, and the strict and purely legalconclusion would be that the Assembly cannot make recommendationsbecause of the difficult/ in separating the two aspects.5. On the other hand, it was agreed that an overwhelming majorityof the members of the Assembly&apos; will certainly want to express their viewson Korea and propose recommendations.     Further, there are obviouspolitical reasons why it is desirable that the Assembly should discussKorea, freed from the shadow of Russian vetoes.     Having regard to this it was agreed that the United Kingdom Delegation need in no way try tostifle discussion on Korea in the General Assembly, but that it should confine its efforts to endeavouring to secure that any resolution adoptedcomplied as far as possible with the notional division indicated in paragraph3(iii) above or at least purports to relate to the future of Korea and not tothat aspect of it which is before the Security Council.     On this understanding the Law Officers in no way wish to insist for any legal reasons on the UnitedKingdom opposing the wishes of the majority to discuss Korea in the Assembly.6. It was agreed at the meeting that there was no need to trouble theCabinet again with this particular matter.7. We have not yet been able to clear the actual text of this telegramwith Attorney-General, as he is away.FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO NEW YORK(To United Kingdom Delegation to United Nations)No.  140223rd September, 1950.Following for Secretary of State from Makins.My immediately preceding telegram about the long term political settlement in Korea has a bearing on your telegrams Nos.  1156 and 1157to the Prime Minister which are now under consideration.     At first sightthe opinion of the Attorney-General on the legal aspects of handling the korean question in the Assembly seems likely to affect the wording ofcertain passages of the draft contained in your telegram No.  1157, forexample recommendation (a), and paragraph (a) (II) of the resolution.
