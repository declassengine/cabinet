THIS   DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1950CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.32CP. (50) 22411th October, 1950CABINETLEGAL ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH UNOFFICIAL STRIKESMemorandum by the Attorney-general  wis.h to suggest to my colleagues that consultations should be held with theT.U.C. with a view to advice being given to the Boards of the various nationalised industries to make greater use of their power to sue in the Civil courts for damagesagainst those who take part in unofficial strikes.2. At present the practice of suing for damages for breach of contract whenstrikes take place exists only in the case of the mining industry and even in that industry it is by no means universal. In South Wales, Lancashire, Yorkshire and,I think, Durham, claims for damages have long been a likely consequence of strike action. But in other districts, notably Scotland, such proceedings are in practicenever taken. A consultation I have had with representatives of the other nation-nationalised industries shows that the employers in these have not hitherto used their civilremedies against strikers and are very much disinclined to start.. They feel (and I gather that apart from the administrative trouble and inconvenience of issuingsummonses, this is their main objection to the proposal) that the commencementof civil proceedings might embitter their relations with their employees after thestrike had been terminated. They prefer that if legal proceedings have to be taken at all the opprobrium resulting from them should be visited upon the Governmentand the Attorney-General, as it is when criminal proceedings are taken, rather thanupon themselves.   I do not share their view.3. While it remains my unenviable responsibility to enforce the existingcriminal law in appropriate cases and at appropriate times against strikers, I havenever pretended to think that the present law is an effective weapon for strikebreaking. The Conditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order, 1940(S.R. and O. 1305 (1940)) in effect absolutely prohibits all strikes, official or not.What would be more useful would be a law delaying strike action either by thenecessity of giving notice terminating the contract of employment (as under the conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875) or one interposing the necessityfor a secret, postal ballot and, in either case, prohibiting the expenditure of money or use of propaganda calling for or supporting strike action in breach of the con-ditions. But even were the law so amended, the criminal law would, I think, remain at best an uncertain and risky weapon. Its use may all too easily bring about the opposite to the desired result; there may be a widespread extension of the strike;those prosecuted tend to be represented as martyrs (by a characteristic extravagancethe ten convicted gas strikers are being described by their Communist colleagues as&quot; like the Tolpuddle Martyrs! &quot;); and at the best antagonism is caused against theGovernment and the police.4. I believe that these results would be largely avoided if use was made of thecivil law of breach of contract rather than the criminal law. Hitherto in the miningindustry where proceedings for damages have been taken, they have been brought in the Magistrates Courts under the Employers and Workmen&apos;s Act, 1875, one ofthe consequences of this procedure being that an order for imprisonment may result from non payment. My suggestion is that the embarrassment of possible imprison-ment should be avoided by the actions being brought in the County Court, the39465
damages claimed being limited to say  10. In the event of the damages not being paid, the employers could, if they thought expedient, levy execution or obtain a judgment summons for the payment of so much per month and no question of imprisonment would arise except, and then only on the employers&apos; motion, in theevent of wilful default. Actions for damages could be brought against all strikers.Moreover, an action in the civil courts against the ringleaders for damages forconspiracy would present far fewer difficulties than criminal proceedings forconspiracy at common law.5. Civil proceedings possess the great advantage that those who take themremain all the time dominus litis in control of the proceedings. Once criminal proceedings are started in a matter like this they must be carried on and althoughthe strike is settled the sentences must be carried out. Not so in the case of the civilremedy. In this the employer can, without loss of face at any time withdraw orcompromise the actions, for instance as part of the terms of settlement. The officialTrade Union representatives can regain the confidence of their members by nego-tiating some mitigation of the damages awarded. The employers may restore goodfeeling between themselves and their employees, once a return to work has been assured, by voluntarily waiving their claims. I think that the importance of keepingcontracts is not entirely lost upon the ordinary working man and that the resentmentcaused by measures for their enforcement, handled as I have suggested, wouldcertainly be less than that which at present I am bound to cause by criminal proceedings.6. My impression from the consultations which I have had is that both theDepartments concerned and the Boards other than the Coal Board and possibly the British Electricity Commission, are much disinclined to adopt a course whichwould involve their accepting any responsibility in this matter. This I can under-stand for it is always easier, in the view of the Departments, for the Law Officers,who alone are responsible for their legal decisions, to carry these awkward burdensthan for Departments so to do. I feel disinclined, however, to use the heavierhammer of the criminal law in cases where the lighter mallet of civil proceedingsmight achieve a possibly more satisfactory result.7. I suggest, therefore that in any discussions there may be with the T.U.C.we should start from a standpoint favourable to civil proceedings and not seekmerely to ascertain the objections to them. In the light of the reactions of theT.U.C. the matter should be discussed with the Boards of the nationalised indus-tries. It would be convenient if these discussions could take place now, in the lullbefore the next occasion which may call for the implementation of the criminal law.H. W. S.Royal Courts of Justice, W.C. 2,llth October, 1950.
