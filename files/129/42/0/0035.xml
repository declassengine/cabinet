THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE   property OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTFESTIVAL OF BRITAIN, 195.1:  SUNDAY AFTERNOON OPENINGMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilOn behalf of the Festival of Britain, 1951, Lord Ismay, the Chairman,Sir Henry French, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Festival Gardens,Limited, and Mr. Gerald Barry, the Director-General of the Festival, have made representations to the Home Secretary and myself that it is essential to the successof their plans and the realisation of their estimates that the South Bank Exhibitionand the Exhibitions of Architecture and Science and the Festival Gardens (all inLondon) should be permitted to open on Sundays after 12.30 p.m.2. The matter has been exhaustively studied by a Working Party of the festival Office and I have obtained the advice of the Churches through the Deanof Westminster^ Advisory Committee of Christian Churches for the Festival,representing all the leading denominations. The Attorney-General advises methat Sunday opening, either of the exhibitions or of the Festival Gardens, cannotsafely by authorised under the existing law. Under the Sunday EntertainmentsAct, 1932, museums, concerts, zoological and botanical gardens and similar activities are made permissible despite the Sunday Observance Act, 1780, but, although the festival Exhibitions are equally educational and innocuous, no provision was madein 1932 for exempting exhibitions. Amusement parks such as that included in a section of the Festival Pleasure Gardens were also not covered by the 1932 Act, andalthough I am informed that most of these are open during the season, includingBelle Vue Gardens at Manchester (which is comparable to the Festival Gardensin charging for admission), the Attorney-General advises that the law is so obscurethat it would not be safe to open the exhibitions or the Festival Gardens on sundays without legislation exempting them from the application of the Sunday observance Act, 1780. Examples of amusement parks currently open on Sundaysare given in the Annex.3. The Government are being asked therefore to authorise the Festival Officeand Festival Gardens, Limited, to open on Sundays from 12.30 p.m. onwards theSouth Bank Exhibition, London; the Exhibition of Science, South Kensington;the 1951 Exhibition of Books, South Kensington; the Exhibition of Architecture,Poplar, and the Festival Pleasure Gardens, Battersea Park, and to introduce legis-lation providing that such opening shall be lawful notwithstanding the Sunday observance Act, 1780.4. There are clearly strong arguments in favour of Sunday opening of theExhibitions, the only real obstacle to which is the lack of explicit provision for itin the Sunday Entertainments Act, 1932. The Churches, through their AdvisoryCouncil, have signified that they would regard legislation for this purpose asnon-controversial, and they say: &quot; that there is not likely to be any oppositionworth speaking of for the promotion of special legislation permitting Sunday opening of Festival activities other than the amusement area of the FestivalGardens.&quot; The Churches have, on the other hand, expressed themselves asresolutely opposed to Sunday opening of the amusement area in the FestivalGardens.5. The obvious course therefore would be to give authority and to promotelegislation which would command widespread agreement for the opening of the printed for the Cabinet.

Exhibitions and of the Festival Gardens minus the amusement area, but thereare the following objections to this course:  (i) The amusement area is physically undivided from the Festival Gardensand most visitors after paying 2s. admission fee would feel aggrievedif they were denied these facilities, especially since theatrical enter-tainments and other shows which can be enjoyed on week-days are inany case ruled out on Sundays. As other parks and gardens with similaramenities are open on Sundays free of charge (or in the case of KewGardens for Id.) the Directors would probably be forced to close thewhole Gardens on Sundays in order to save on overhead expenses andto avoid heavy losses, if they were not able to operate the amusementsection on Sunday afternoons and evenings. A decision to keep theamusement section closed is tantamount economically to a decisionto close the Gardens.(ii) Many overseas and provincial visitors, who are only able to fit in a visit atweek-ends, will be deprived of the full amenities of the Festival Gardensunless the amusement park is open on Sundays. In so far as more visitors  seek to avoid this deprivation by coming to London for the Festival onweek-days they will aggravate the difficulties of the police and trans-port authorities in keeping normal traffic moving and in avoidingcongestion.(iii) The revenue of the Festival Gardens depends partly on stiff rents from various concessionaires, some of whom are likely to withdraw altogetherunless the Festival Gardens as a whole are open on Sundays, thus reducing their attractiveness and increasing the prospective loss on operations which is rendered inevitable by the decision to -confine theopening of the Festival Gardens to a few months in 1951 only.(iv) The Board of Directors of Festival Gardens, Ltd., who have given much time voluntarily to making the Festival Gardens a success, would have some grievance if the Government were to debar them from Sunday opening on policy grounds or owing to the uncertainty of the law, whenother amusement parks in many parts of England open regularly on sundays without any question.6. The following further points should be noted about Sunday afternoonopening of the Festival Pleasure Gardens including the amusement section:  (a) The Vicar of Battersea and the Battersea clergy of other denominations areprepared publicly to support Sunday opening of the whole Gardens(including the amusement section) provided they are given facilities for holding open-air services in the Gardens. The Board of FestivalGardens, Ltd., would agree to this.ib) Violent opposition must in any case be expected from the Lord&apos;s DayObservance Society, and the Methodist paper Joyful News hasalready organised a petition on the strength of misleading press reports.The Churches, generally, support and are participating widely in, the festival of Britain: it is not known how far their opposition on thisparticular point would be pressed, nor is it yet possible to judge how far^ other bodies would actively defend Sunday opening.(c) There is no controversy regarding the Sunday opening of any show which isthe direct responsibility of the Festival Office. Controversy is confined to that part of the programme responsibility for which has been dele-gated to a separate Company Festival Gardens, Limited which isjointly financed by the Government and the London County Council,and includes a number of independent Directors. The Government couldof course veto any attempt by Festival Gardens, Limited, to follow theusual practice of opening their amusement section on Sundays, and itis in this indirect manner that Government responsibility is involved.(d) The amusement section of the Pleasure Gardens is about a quarter of a mile from the nearest houses in any direction, with many well-growntrees in between, and the amusement caterers are debarred from making any mechanical musical or other noises at any time. Openingof the amusement section should not therefore affect the Sunday restof the neighbourhood except in so far as there is disturbance fromvisitors and traffic coming or going. My recent visits to The Tivoli atCopenhagen and Liseberg at Gothenburg confirm that such gardensare not disturbing to their neighbourhoods.
7. My colleagues will appreciate that the political considerations involved are very difficult, and it is unfortunate that such a matter should arise in the presentParliamentary situation. It seems out of the question not to authorise the openingof the London Exhibitions and to secure for the Festival Office the legal protectionwhich they seek for that purpose. In the circumstances I do not see how similarprotection can be refused to the Board of Festival Gardens, Limited, who are doing an excellent job and would, in common with the Government, have to facecontinuing and severe public criticism if they were not able to cater for visitorson Sunday afternoons. I would stress that the proposed legislation would notapply to anything outside London.I therefore seek authority to prepare and introduce legislation giving protec-tion against proceedings under the Sunday Observance Act, 1780, in respect ofthe opening from 12.30 p.m. onwards on Sundays of the South Bank Exhibition,the Exhibitions of Science, Architecture and Books, and the Festival PleasureGardens (including the amusement section) promoted by the Festival of Britain,1951, and Festival Gardens, Limited.H.
