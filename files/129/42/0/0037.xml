In the Session which liesbefore you the necessary increases in production for defence will call for increasedefforts and sacrifices, but I am confident that with the unfailing support of all my loyal subjects the nation will be enabled to play its full part in the defence of freedom and the preservation of peace.In Korea forces, for the first time under the flag of the United Nations, areovercoming the invaders. The success of this historic action in which My Forces areplaying their part marks a decisive moment in world affairs, and is arousing freshhopes of the unification of Korea and of a lasting settlement of the Korean problem in accord with freedom and democracy. It has already given proof of the ability ofthe United Nations to meet a threat to world peace.My Government also support strongly the efforts of the Specialised agencies of the United Nations which are directed to improving the standard of living inimpoverished or backward countries.My Ministers in the United Kingdom will maintain the closest relations withthe other Governments of the Commonwealth in order to safeguard freedom and peace.

The Queen and I look forward with high expectationto the opening of the Festival next May.Although the rearmament programme will make heavy demands upon thenation, My Government will devote special attention to ensuring that there is as little interference as possible with the furtherance of their social policy, the pro-vision of homes for the people, the maintenance of the stability of costs and prices and the continuance of the achievements of the export drive.In order that full employment may be ensured and the resources of the com-munity used to best advantage, legislation will be introduced to make available toMy Ministers, on a permanent basis but subject to appropriate Parliamentary safe-guards, powers to regulate production, distribution and consumption and to controlprices.39509
