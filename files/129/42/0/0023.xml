103HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 2236TH OCTOBER, 1950NEW YORK MEETINGSDEFENCE OF EUROPE AND GERMAN PARTICIPATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsPerhaps the most important subject discussed during the new york meetings was the United States plan for an integrated force for thedefence of Europe and the participation therein of German units.     Thediscussion of this plan took up most of the time of the tripartite meetings between Mr. Acheson, M. Schuman and myself, and also of the atlantic council.     It was also discussed at a meeting, between the Minister ofDefence and myself and our United States and French colleagues, speciallyconvened in the hope of overcoming French objections to the participation of German units.2. The Americans had already given some indication of what theyhad in mind before I left for New York;   but it was not until I sawMr. Acheson that the full implications of the American proposals weremade clear.3. The United States thesis as propounded by Mr. Acheson wasroughly as follows.     The essential aim is to defend Western Europe andnot to liberate it.     This can only be done by the full use of all available resources.     For this purpose, as the President has announced, the americans intend to send further substantial bodies of troops to Europe.The next step is the formation of these tro ips, and of the forces availablein Europe of the other Treaty countries, into an integrated force undera Supreme Commander, with a unified international staff.     But even thisis not enough.     The forces available are still insufficient for the defenceof Europe.     Moreover if Europe is to be defended and saved from occupa-tion by an aggressor she must be defended in Germany.     For these two reasons it is essential to make use of German resources.   This can onlybe done with safety by the incorporation of German units in the integratedforce.     Only thus can the defence of Europe be assured without a revival of German militarism.4. When Mr. Acheson first outlined the United States thesis toM. Schuman and myself, we both welcomed the American decision to sendmore troops to Europe and the proposed formation of an integrated force.We both expressed doubts, however, on the immediate necessity of includingthe Germans in this force.     M. Schuman was particularly insistent that french public opinion would not tolerate even this measure of German re-armament at the present time, and argued strongly that the immediate need was not to rearm Germany but to arm and equip the forces of the western allies.     He feared, moreover, the effect of such a decision on Germanopinion and also possible reactioxio in the Soviet Union and the satellitecountries.2 ICOPY NO. ? cabinet

5. For my part, I said that we must proceed cautiously.     We mustnot put the Germans in a position where they could bargain with us.     Theessential first steps, I thought, were to proceed with the organisation ofthe integrated force, and at the same time to build up the German Police.The question of German participation in the integrated force came second,and we should test out German opinion on this subject before taking any final decision.6. It soon became clear that this practical approach to the problem would not satisfy the Americans.     They felt strongly that their plan wasa whole and must be accepted or rejected as a whole:   and they left us inno doubt that their decision to contribute American troops to an integratedEuropean force was conditional on a favourable decision regarding the participation of German units in that force.7. At the same time, it was evident from the discussions in theNorth Atlantic Council that, although most of them were without definite instructions from their Governments, the majority of the Foreign ministers were in favour of accepting the whole American plan.     Some of them sharedour own doubts about rearming the Germans, but were so conscious of the imminent danger and of the vital necessity of ensuring as quickly aspossible an adequate defence of Western Europe that they were preparedto accept the lesser of two evils.     The French alone, with some half-hearted support from the Belgians and Luxembourgers, stood out firmlyagainst the American proposals.8. In these circumstances I reached the conclusion that I must acceptthe principle of German participation in the integrated force and I soughtand obtained the concurrence of the Cabinet in this line (CM.(50) 59thConclusions, Minute 1).     I made it clear, however, that the first step mustbe the organisation of the integrated force itself so that a position of strength was established on the Continent before the German units were brought in.9. In spite of the virtually unanimous opinion ranged against them the French still refused to give in.     It was therefore necessary to adjourn the Council for a week, firstly to enable the Ministers of some of thesmaller countries to obtain final instructions from their Governments, and secondly in the hope that, in the interval the French might be brought round.With this second object in view, a meeting was arranged, at M. Schuman&apos;suggestion, . between Mr. Acheson, M. Schuman and myself and our three defence colleagues.     At this meeting the Minister of Defence and I on one side, and Mr. Acheson and General Marshall on the other, did our utmost to persuade M. Schuman and M. Moch to accept the principle of german participation in an integrated force.     In this we failed utterly.     M. Mochwas adamant, and indeed very much tougher than M. Schuman had been.The three Defence Ministers were able to reach agreement on certainimmediate measures such as strengthening the Police and Labour Serviceunits, creating a Civil Defence Organisation and Engineer units, planning the production of light military equipment, etc. ;  but the French absolutelyrefused to agree that these measures were preliminary steps to theformation of German armed units.10. The result of the French refusal to accept the principle of german rearmament was that the Americans, for their part, refused to give their final agreement to the formation of an integrated force.     When the atlantic council reconvened, it was therefore obliged to pass a resolution which still left both these questions in some measure undecided.     A copy of this resolution is annexed.     It will be seen that while it outlines the principles

on which the integrated force shall be established and asks the DefenceCommittee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to recommenddetailed steps to that end, it specifically states (in the one but last paragraph) that the &quot;plan is not finalised at this time&quot;.    As regardsGermany, the resolution leaves it to the Defence Committee of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation &quot;to make specific recommendations regarding the method by which, from the technical point of view, germany could make its most useful contribution to the successful implementation of the plan&quot; (i. e. for the integrated force).11. The present position is therefore as follows:-(i)     The Military Organisation of the North Atlantic Treaty is working out detailed plans for the formation of an integrated force forthe defence of Europe.(ii)     These plans will not, however, be finally approved by the americans until agreement has been reached on the principle of the participation of German units.     In particular the United States Govern-ment will be most reluctant to commit further American forces to Europeuntil agreement has been reached on this principle.E.B.Foreign Office, S.W.1,6TH OCTOBER, 1950.ANNEXRESOLUTION APPROVED BY THE north atlantic council the North Atlantic Council:Having fully discussed the measures taken and planned for thedefence of Western Europe:AndNoting the resolution of the Council Deputies concerning the adequacy of such measures and agreeing with the Deputies&apos; conclusionsthat the aggregate of the efforts so far reported are still far short of therequirements for the defence of Western Europe;Concludes:That the defence of Western Europe will require:(a) the establishment at the earliest possible date of an integratedforce under centralised command and control composed of forces madeavailable by Governments for the defence of Western Europe;(b) the full utilisation of man-power and productive resources available from all sources;

Approves:The concept of an integrated force adequate to deter aggression and ensure the defence of Western Europe, including Western Germany;Agrees:That such an integrated force shall be established at the earliestpossible date, and that the composition, organisation and command of suchforce shall be based upon the following principles:1.      The force shall be organised under the North-Atlantic treaty organisation and shall be subject to political and strategic guidanceexercised by the appropriate agencies of the North Atlantic Treaty.2.      The force shall be under the command of a Supreme Commander.The geographic limits of his command in peace time shall be clearly defined.     He will in peace time have sufficient delegated authority toensure that the National units allocated to his command are organised and trained into an effective integrated force. He will exercise the full powers of a Supreme Commander in the event of war.3,      The Supreme Commander shall be appointed as soon as there isassurance that National forces will be made available for the integratedforce adequate to enable the latter to be reasonably capable of fulfillingits responsibilities.4.      Pending the appointment of a Supreme Commander, there shallbe appointed forthwith a Chief of Staff who shall be responsible, and beendowed with the necessary authority, for the organisation and training of forces made available by the National Governments.5.      The Supreme Commander, and pending his appointment the Chiefof Staff, shall be provided with combined international staff drawn from the nationals of all nations contributing to the force.     The first task of thestaff should be to plan and take the measures necessary to implement theorganisation of the integrated force.6.      The integrated force should be composed of National units.Governments concerned should make firm commitments at the earliestpossible date as to the forces to be placed under the control of the supreme commander in peace time, including the date upon which they will be placed under his control, and as to the additional forces which will initially beplaced under his command in the event of war.7.      The Standing Group shall be responsible for higher strategicdirection in areas in which combined North Atlantic Treaty forces are operating.     As such it will be the superior military body to which theSupreme Commander, and pending his appointment the Chief of Staff, willbe responsible.     It will also determine the military requirements of theintegrated force.Requests:That the Defence Committee consider and recommend to theCouncil as a matter of urgency:A.      The detailed steps necessary to establish the integrated forcein accordance with the foregoing principles.

B. The powers to be exercised by the Supreme Commander inpeace time and the geographic limits within which he should exercisethem.C. The method and t ming of contributions by Governments ofNational units in being to the integrated force.D. The further authority, if any, which the Standing Group wouldrequire so as to ensure effective discharge of its responsibilities andalso what adjustments in its organisation and its present relations withthe accredited representatives may be required to assure and improve the necessary close working relationship between the Standing Group andthe member governments not represented on it.E. The consequent changes and simplifications required in theexisting military structure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisationand related military organisations.F. The channel by which the higher direction of the integratedforce as regards political considerations upon which strategic decisions should be based, can most effectively be conveyed by the Council to themilitary agencies of the Ndrth Atlantic Treaty Organisation.Further states:That it has considered the question of the nature, extent and timing of German participation in the build up of the defence of western europe, and has noted that this matter is now under discussion by thethree Occupying Powers with the German Federal Government.     since in the view of many of the Ministers the proper and early, solution of this problem is intimately connected with the successful implementation of theplan outlined above, that plan is not finalised at this time.Accordingly requests:The Defence Committee in the light of the information available at the time of its meeting, to make specific recommendations regardingthe method by which, from the technical point of view, Germany could make its most useful contribution to the1 successful implementation of theplan, bearing in mind the unanimous conclusion of the Council that itwould not serve the best interests of Europe or of Germany to bring into being a German National Army or a German General Staff.
