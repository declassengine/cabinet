THIS   DOCUMENT IS THE   PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1950SECRET Copy No.CP. (50) 2182%th September, 1950CABINETSUPPLEMENTARY PENSIONS IN THE SOCIALISED industries memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIN accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 13th July (CM. (50)45th Conclusions, Minute 3), I saw representatives of the Trades Union Congress,with the other Ministers chiefly concerned, and told them that it was the intentionof the Government to set up a Departmental Committee of experienced persons to enquire into supplementary pensions schemes generally, and also that, in presentcircumstances and pending consideration of the recommendations of the proposed committee, we were of the opinion that there should be no extension in the socialised industries of present arrangements for supplementary pensions formanual workers. We had a useful and friendly discussion, but the T.U.C. repre-sentatives had some misgivings, and they asked me to put the Governments views in writing so that they could be formally considered by the General Council.I annex copies of the letter wfhich, after consulting my colleagues, I sent toSir Vincent Tewson, and of Sir Vincenfs reply.2. As will be seen, the General Council are doubtful about the proposed inquiry on two grounds. They think that there would be serious disadvantages it&apos;,setting up a &quot; representative &quot; Committee &quot; to make recommendations on a subject which cannot be entirely separated from wages and conditions of employment&quot;;and they are afraid that the existence of the Committee might be used as an argument for deferring negotiations about supplementary pensions schemes in the socialised industries. They suggest that if there should be an inquiry it wouldbe better that it should be conducted by Government Departments. They alsoreaffirm their view that nothing should be done which might in any way interferewith the right of unions to negotiate pensions schemes with the Boards.3. The Socialisation of Industries Committee have considered Sir VincentTewson&apos;s letter (S.I. (M) (50) 7th Meeting, Minute 1), and they came to the following conclusions, which they asked me to submit to the Cabinet.(i) There is a clear case for an investigation of the question of supplementary pensions schemes by persons of standing whose opinions would carryweight with both sides of industry. Officials might be able to collect the bare facts, but, to make a really useful contribution to the solutionof the important long-term questions which arise, the inquiry should go into such matters as the ways in which existing schemes are working out in practice and the difficulties which have been experienced. Itshould also ascertain the views of those concerned and examine theeconomic and other implications for the future of the existence and continued development of supplementary pensions schemes. TheTrades Union Congress are under a misconception in seeing any objec-tion of principle to an inquiry of this kind; there are many precedents forinquiries into general conditions of employment, such as hours of labourand holidays with pay.If the Cabinet agrees that the inquiry should be proceeded with,we would propose to explain the reasons to the T.U.C. and try tosecure the support of the General Council.39409
(ii) We have already told the General Council that the trade unions are entirelyfree to discuss the question of supplementary pensions with the Boards,but they fear that, pending the inquiry and in view of the Governmenfsknown attitude on the subject, little, if any, effective progress will bepossible until the report has been received. There is much force inthis, but the trade unions feel strongly on the subject, and it is desirablethat we should go as far as we possibly can to meet the General Council.It seemed to the Socialisation of Industries Committee that we mightmeet them to some extent by giving an assurance that, notwithstanding the appointment of the Committee, the unions would be free to negotiate with the Boards. Any schemes which were put forward by the Boardsas a result of the legotiations would of course be carefully considered,but no commitment could be given at this stage as to the attitude which ministers would adopt towards them.4. I ask the Cabinet to agree that we should proceed with the proposed inquiry, but that, in the first instance, we should explain the Governmenfs attitude to the General Council on the lines suggested above and do our best to reach agree-ment with them.H. M.Privy Council Office, S.W.I.28th September, 1950.ANNEXCONFIDENTIALMy dear Tewson, 25th July, 1950.At the meeting between Ministers and representatives of the General Councilon 17th July about supplementary pensions for manual workers in the socialised industries, I undertook, on behalf of the Prime Minister, to send you a note of the government&apos;s views on the matters discussed.(1) The trade unions are, of course, entirely free to discuss the question ofsupplementary pensions with the Boards.(2) As the General Council are aware, under the statutes pensions schemesfor the socialised industries require express Ministerial approval. Thosewho take part in any discussions which may be arranged between the boards and the unions will no doubt, therefore, wish to pay full regardto the views which the Government have expressed on the subject andto the economic and other considerations to which Ministers have drawnthe attention of ihe General Council.(3) The question of what should be done in the socialised industries cannot bedivorced from the wider question of how provision for old age additional to that under the National Insurance Act may best be made. As therepresentatives of the General Council recognised, complex issues ofgreat importance for the future arise. In order that future policy maybe soundly based in the interests of everybody concerned, account mustbe taken of the extent and character of existing schemes for supple-mentary pensions, and the implications of any wide extension of theexisting arrangements need to be examined.In these circumstances the Government have come to the conclusion that themost constructive course will be to appoint a Committee of Inquiry of experiencedpersons, on which there would be trade union representation, to go thoroughly intothe whole problem and to make recommendations on which long-term policy canbe based. It is provisionally proposed that the Committee&apos;s terms of reference shallbe on the following lines: -&quot; To examine the economic and other implications for the long-term interests of the community of the existence and continued development ofschemes for retirement and old age pensions additional to the provision underthe National Insurance Act, and to make recommendations.&quot;
I shall be glad to receive as soon as possible any comments which the general council may wish to make.I hope thsd the General Council will agree that a comprehensive inquiry such.as we are contemplating offers the best method of arriving at the facts and a satis-factory statement of the questions which are presented by a problem of such far-reaching importance from the point of view of trade unionists and of the community as a whole.I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Lincoln Evans.Yours sincerely,(Signed) HERBERT MORRISON.Sir H. Vincent Tewson, C.B.E., M.C.Trades Union CongressTransport House,Smith Square, London, S.W. 1,Dear Mr Morrison, \Ath September, 1950.Pensions in Nationalised industries I am writing with further reference to your letter of 25th July regardingpensions in nationalised industries, in which you state that the Government havedecided to appoint a Committee of Enquiry to examine the whole question and inwhich you ask for our comments on proposed terms of reference for this Committee.The General Council have now given further consideration to this matter.Whilst they agree that there may be a case for the collection of comprehensiveinformation on the structure and operation of pensions schemes in industry, their view is that such an enquiry, if undertaken, should be conducted by GovernmentDepartments. They think that there would be serious disadvantages in setting upa representative committee of the type you have suggested with powers to make recommendations on a subject which cannot be entirely separated from wages andconditions of employment. They foresee the danger, moreover, that such an enquiry might extend over a long period during which the existence of theCommittee might be cited by Boards of publicly-owned industries as a reason fordeferring negotiations for new pensions schemes or for the removal of anomalies.In these circumstances the General Council ask the Government to review thedecision that such a Committee of Enquiry should be set up, and wish to reaffirmtheir previously expressed view that nothing should be done which might in anyway interfere with the right of unions to negotiate pensions schemes with Boards.Yours sincerely,(Signed) VINCENT TEWSON,General Secretary.
