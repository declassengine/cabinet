fj jfVw ^(IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y-&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 23819TH OCTOBER, 19501COPY NO. 32CABINETLEASEHOLD reform memorandum by the Attorney-GeneralThe discussions which we have so far had upon this matterhave, I think, made it increasingly apparent that the wider the scope of any temporary legislation the greater are the complications and the more trouble-some the implications of what we seek to do.   Although I must confess thatI originally thought that the scope of the protection which we should giveshould cover as wide a field as possible, I am more and more forced to theconclusion that if, as the Cabinet has decided, we are to introduce merelytemporary legislation now, with the promise of permanent legislationinvolving a right to the renewal of leases or to leasehold enfranchisementas soon as may be possible, we should confine the temporary protection tothe class of case for which it was originally sought, that is to say, the caseof a long building lease in respect of which a ground-rent only is paid andin which the tenant regards the house as being in effect his own since either he or his predecessors built and paid for it.   I suggest therefore that ourlegislation should be under the following heads.(1) All building leases which would otherwise expire in the two years ending on the 31st December, 1952, or in which, although their term hasalready expired, the occupying tenant is still holding over, to be continued for an additional two years.   This would embrace the so-called South Walescases in which the falling-in of leases is no doubt giving rise to considerable,i    although  localised, hardship.    It would also cover the case, to which importanceI    kasrightly been attached by the Minister of Health,where, owing to the falling-inof a head lease, the protection previously given under the Rent RestrictionActs to a sub-tenant becomes destroyed in consequence of the decision of theI &apos; court in the Knightsbridge case.    It is, I think, in any event, impossible topick up the cases where this protection has already been lost, although I do not\    believe their number to be nearly so great as has been suggested.   It would,however, prevent head leases falling in during the two years&apos; period and would leave time to deal with the problem by permanent legislation or by amendmentt    of the Rent Restriction   Acts.I do not apprehend that there would be any difficulty in defining1   what is meant by a building lease simply by reference to the original term ofI   years, say, twenty-one or over, for which it had been created.(2) The leases so extended should continue for the additional tw* years:   on the same terms and conditions subject to the following points:-1(a)       In the case of an occupying tenant holding direct from the ground-landlord the ground rent should continue without increase.   This may no doubt9  involve hardship to the ground-landlords in a number of cases for it is

completely erroneous to suppose that all or even most of these leaseholdreversions are held either by Earls or estate companies.   Quite a pro-portion are held by small investors and very many by universities,charities and similar bodies.   Nonetheless, in view of the fact that theprotection is only temporary and that considerable complication would attend any attempt to provide for an increase in the rents, I think we would bejustified, having regard to the general balance of hardship, in saying thatthe occupying tenant could continue at the same rent,(b) It is, however, erroneous to suppose that all these buildingleases are now  held by tenants holding them direct from the ground-landlord and paying only a ground-rent.    I am told that in the greatmajority of cases the truth is that an intermediate landlord, generally anestate company, has come into possession of the tenancy and, although &apos;paying only a ground-rent to the ground-landlord, is exacting a rack-rentfrom the sub-tenant.   It would be manifestly unjust to deprive the ground-landlord of his property merely in order to give two years of extra profitto the intermediate speculator.   In this latter case, therefore, I suggestthat the rent for the additional period of two years should be such as might be agreed between the parties or, in default of agreement, settled bythe county court and, in any event, not exceeding the profit made by the intermediate landlord.(c) Provision would have to be made to ensure that, during thetwo years&apos; period, there was no forfeiture in respect of breach of thecovenant to maintain in repair.(3) A Bill on these lines would not give rise to the difficultiesof the tied cottage.    It should, on the other hand, apply to Crown property in general, but not to property of the two Duchies.   In the latter case,personal and constitutional difficulties arise and the Duchies will, in any event, undertake to conform in practice to the requirements of the legislation.(4) It must be admitted that legislation on these lines will not cover the no doubt numerous cases where great hardship is being suffered by people who, immediately before the war and in some cases during the course of thewar, acquired leases of houses and land at a rack rent in the expectation that, when the lease came to an end, they would be able to secure itsrenewal or to obtain other premises on at least equally advantageous terms.The war has, of course, caused a grave change in circumstances, bringinggreat benefit to the landlord and great hardship to the tenant in such cases.Once one intervenes to protect these cases, however, all sorts of complicationsbegin, as we have seen, to arise.(5) Nor can I think it would be proper to attempt amendments tothe rent restriction legislation by a kind of side-door or subterfuge in temporary legislation of the kind under contemplation now.   I therefore suggest to my colleagues that we should introduce legislation on the above lines as quickly as possible but should at the same time state clearly thatit is our intention to introduce legislation of wider and permanent scopegiving a right to a renewal of expiring leases on equitable terms and also toleasehold enfranchisement.H.
