(50)  205 COPY NO.QTH SEPTEMBER.  1950CABINETPROPOSALS FOR PROMOTING THE efficiency of THE UNITED nations memorandum by the Attorney-general it is not surprising that in the existing state of world affairs many nations should be giving anxious thought tothe possibility of so improving the organisation of the united nations as to enable it to take immediate and effective actionin the event of further aggression.    It is recognised that the intervention of the Security Council in the Korean conflictwas made possible by circumstances which although fortunatewere fortuitous and not likely to recur.    Had the representativeof the Soviet Union been present at the meetings of the security council at the time he would certainly have vetoed the resolutions which were in fact adopted, and as far as I can see would havebeen able to prevent any formal action by the United Nations:this was no doubt one of the reasons which led the Soviet union to reverse its policy of absence from the Security Council.It is true that a Russian veto at this stage would not have prevented the United States or other Powers from going to theassistance of South Korea (as, indeed, the United States had already done)  since Article 51 of the Charter preserves the right of  .collective self defence until such time as the Security Councilintervenes.    But it would certainly have made it unlikely thatfifty-three nations would rally to the support of South korea and have made it impossible to say that the present operations were being conducted by and on behalf of the United Nations,a possibility which, in the event, has certainly been exploitedto the full, as for instance by the &quot;appointment&quot; of general macarthur as &quot;United Nations Commander&quot; (a position which apparently enables him to speak now on behalf of the united nations, now for the United States and now on his own account!)and by the refusal of the United States Government to acceptdelivery of a note addressed to them by the Soviet Union inregard to the action of the United States Air Force in shootingdown a Russian aircraft.    The realisation that these and similaradvantages are not likely to be available in the event of anyfurther exercise of Soviet-inspired aggression certainly makes it very necessary to see  whether  the organisation of the united nations, can be made more effective and has led to proposals suchas those contemplated by the United States and Canada (cf. C.P.(50)196) designed to shift the sphere of United Nations&apos;  activityfrom the Security Council to the Assembly, where there is noveto and also those in relation to the provision of armed forces(cf.  CP. (50) 197) to act on behalf of the United Nations,    In my view all these, and indeed any-, other proposals to the same end,are likely to be illusory if not illegal.2. What is lost sight of by these proposals is that thereis no legal means of amending the Charter without the consentof the five permanent members, including the Soviet Union and of

China (Article 108) and that the Charter as now frameddeliberately emphasises the predominance of the security council.    Article 2k allocates to the Security Council the&quot;primary responsibility&quot; for the maintenance of international peace and security, while under Article 11 it is incumbentupon the General Assembly to refer any question concerninginternational peace to the Security Council for action.Moreover, when the Security Council is exercising its functions in regard to any matter, Article 12 forbidsthe General Assembly from even making any recommendation in regard to it.    It is true that by a procedural vote(which is not subject to veto) the Security Council canremove a matter from its Agenda, although even here I donot doubt that Soviet ingenuity might make this process aprotracted one.    But even assuming that a matter were removed from the Agenda of the Security Council and thusbrought within -the scope of the General Assembly, if thematter were one requiring &quot;action&quot; (as for instance militaryoperations by the forces of Member States acting on behalfof the United Nations) Article 11(2) would require theAssembly to refer the matter to the Security Council,    Itis to be added that unless the General Assembly kept itself in permanent session the present rules of procedure require a minimum of ten to fourteen days notice of the summoning   &quot;of a special session,3* These considerations would I think make theUnited States proposal A in C,P,(50) 196 clearly ultra viresand, while their proposal B would be less open to legalobjection, it clearly could not be operated in the absenceof a two-thirds majority vote in the General Assembly and could in practice, I should have thought, always be delayedif not frustrated by the Soviet Union putting the subject matter proposed to be investigated on the Agenda of theSecurity Council, thus preventing the General Assemblymaking any recommendation^    Moreover, although I thinkproposal B less open to legal objection 1 cannot doubt that thequestion whether it involved &quot;action&quot; only competent to theSecurity Council would be a subject of endless legal quibbling.1+. Similar reasoning would, I think, lead to the viewthat the American proposals-in regard to armed forcescontained in C.P*(50) 197 would in practice be equally illusory.No doubt, under Article ll(l)  the General Assembly mightrecommend that Member States should maintain certain armed forces available at the&apos;disposal of the United Nations.But it seems to me to be clear that any decision by theUnited Nations involving the use of such forces (whether thedecision took the form merely of a recommendation or purported to impose an obligation) could legally only be taken by theSecurity Council.    Articles 21+, 39, 1+1 and 1+2 make it abundantly clear that such matters are within the province of theSecurity Council and I do not think there can be much doubtthat, as a matter of international lav;,  the combined effectof these Articles and of Articles 11 and 12 was that action by military ,forces on behalf of the United Nations,  or any-other enforcement action, must be controlled by the security council alone.5. It is,  therefore, for consideration whether any useful purpose would be served by canvassing before the&apos;General Assembly proposals which it would be hard to saywere within either the letter or the spirit of the Charter.The Soviet delegation is to be led by M. Vishinsky who is,of course,  a lawyer of great capacity and versatility.    on previous occasions when legal doubts have arisen on tneCharter we have, when feeling ourselves on strong ground,

sometimes recommended that an advisory opinion should beobtained from the International Court.   M, Vishinsky isquite capable of turning the tables against us and&apos;making thesame suggestion in regard to these proposals for tinkering withthe Charter.6. In my view the only legal way of making effectivearrangements for collective security is one which I suggested to the Foreign Office during the Second Session of the general assembly in 19^6, when it was obviously premature..Under Article 51 of the Charter the right of individual or collective self defence is preserved to members unless anduntil the Security Council takes action.    This would leave open the right of all peace loving nations to enter into a treaty for mutual defence against aggression, and if membership were left open to all members of the United Nations (i.e,  including theSoviet Union and her satellites) who desired to join the treatycould be made in effect a kind of protocol to the Charter ofthe United Nations,    Under the proposal 1 made,  the treaty powers, acting through their Ambassadors in Washington, couldinstantly decide whether a case of aggression calling for any and what military action had occurred and it would thereuponbe incumbent upon the Powers concerned to give such assistance as they could and legal for them to do so.    Some time after Ihad made my proposal, Mr. Hamilton. Armstrong, a well-known and respectable American authority on foreign affairs published a similar plan with much greater elaboration than I have attempted here.    The Atlantic Pact is basically an arrangement of this nature.    But the Korean aggression has shown thataggression vitally affecting the peace of the world need not directly involve the Atlantic Powers.   Nor would a similarPacific Pact or a multiplicity of such arrangements necessarilycover all possibilities.    Peace being universal what is reallyrequired is a universal pact to maintain it - an Atlantic Pactwrit large,    I do not doubt that it would be within the competence of the United Nations General Assembly to recommend that,in order to implement the Pact of Paris 1928 for outlawing war,and under Article 51 of the Charter, Member Nations should enter into a General Treaty for the enforcement of peace and forimmediate collective self defence against aggression.    It ison some such lines as these, as it seems to me, that the united nations can most usefully act in existing circumstances.H.W.S.Law Courts, W. C.2. ,. 9TH SEPTEMBER, 1950.
