THIS  DOCUMENT IS   THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTYS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September-1950.CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 32CP. (50) 21120th September, 1950 -CABINETCOUNCIL OF EUROPE-CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTSMemorandum by the Minister of State /At their meeting on 1st August, the Cabinet, after considering my memorandumon the draft Convention on Human Rights prepared under the auspices of theCouncil of Europe (CP. (50) 179), invited me to submit a memorandum explaininghow it came about that a draft Convention, which was not in accord with,theGovernments economic policy, should have reached such an advanced stage bfpreparation before it was submitted for consideration by Ministers (CM. (50)52nd Conclusions, Minute 3). I am therefore circulating this memorandum forthe information of my colleagues.2. The stages in the preparation of this draft Convention were as follows:In September 1949, the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a.resolution in which it recommended the Committee of Ministers to cause to bedrawn up as early as possible a draft Convention designed to ensure the effectiveenjoyment of certain specified fundamental rights and freedoms. At their meetingon 27th October, 1949, the Cabinet approved a recommendation by the foreign secretary that, at the following Session of the Committee of Ministers, he should accept in principle that a Convention on Human Rights should be drawn up(CM. (49) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 5)..3. The Committee of Ministers subsequently authorised the holding of anumber of meetings at Strasbourg, first of a group of legal experts, and secondlyof a group of senior officials representing Governments. These were instructed&quot; to draw up a draft Convention to serve as a basis for future discussions in theCommittee of Ministers, paying due attention to the progress which has been achieved in this matter by the competent organs of the United Nations.&quot;4. The United Kingdom representatives at these meetings directed their efforts to ensuring, as far as possible, that the draft should take full account ofthe policy publicly expressed by the Government from time to time in connectionwith the United Nations Covenant on Human Rights. They paid special attentionto the Governments views as to the necessity (emphasised and illustrated by theLord Chancellor in the debate on Human Rights in the House of Lords on 5th May,1948) of setting out in precise terms the obligations to be undertaken under theConvention, and of avoiding vague generalisations.5. The draft which emerged from these meetings was the joint production ofrepresentatives of eleven different countries, each of whom had differing ideas notonly as to what was proper for inclusion in the Convention but also as to the form which it should take. That the draft Convention in its present form precisely definesthe limitations attaching to the respective &quot;rights&quot; is due almost entirely to the adherence by the United Kingdom representatives to the Governments policy as explained by the Lord Chancellor, and their insistent opposition to the representa-tives of other countries who felt that the &quot; rights &quot; should be defined in broad terms,and that the Convention should contain a general limitation clause, the ultimateinterpretation of which would, in case of dispute, be settled by an international court who would thus, in time, build up a body of &quot; case law.&quot; This would have39375
been tantamount td a surrender by Governments of their essential duty of legislatingto an international body who would make the law by the establishment of prece-dents. Such a course would clearly have been contrary to the expressed policyof the Government. - ;&apos;-&apos;-&apos;Vi6. It follows, however, that the text which ultimately emerged inevitablyrepresented,-to a large extent, a compromise between opposing schools of thought,and, although, as was pointed out in paragraph 9 of CP. (50) 179, certain compara-tively minor amendments would be necessary to make the text satisfactory, it is felt that the text drawn up by the; official representatives was, in all the circum-stances, reasonably satisfactory to the United Kingdom. ,7. In considering whether the draft Convention conflicted in any way with theGovernmettt&apos;s economic policy, Ministers appear to have had in mind particularlyArticles 4, 8 and 11.8. As regards Article 4, the question of the &quot; forced labour &quot; Article in theUnited Nations&quot; Bill of Rights &quot; (as it was then known) was considered by theCabinet as long ago as October 1947 (CP. (47) 296). In dealing with this Articlethe United Kingdom representatives in both the United Nations and Council ofEurope have always had fully in mind the points brought out in the Cabinet&apos;s dis-cussion of the matter (CM. (47) 83rd Conclusions, Minute 6), and, while the formthe Article now takes is necessarily influenced by the subsequent proceedings inthe United Nations, it appears not to be in conflict with the opinions then expressedby the Cabinet.9. Article 8 arises put of the recommendation by the Consultative assembly that the draft Convention should ensure, inter alia-&quot; freedom from all arbitrary, interferences in private and family life, homeand correspondence, in accordance with Article 12 of the United NationsDeclaration.&quot;In the draft Convention put forward at an earlier stage by the United Kingdom no provision corresponding with this Article was included, (a) because there is nosimilar provision in the United Nations Covenant, and (b) because it was felt that provision for the really important freedoms in this context was already made in theother Articles of the draft Convention, which covered the ground to a considerable extent. To the extent that the ground was not covered-i.e., search of premises and house visitation the United Kingdom representatives took the view that a separateArticle was hardly necessary. During the last series of meetings of the official representatives, however, a majority came down in favour of including an articledealing specifically with interference with privacy, &amp;c, and in the circumstances theUnited Kingdom representatives could do no more than make efforts to ensure thatthe Article should be in the form most likely to command acceptance by their government. The draft before the official representatives was based on Article 12of the Declaration of Human Rights, and read as follows:  &quot; No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy,family, home or correspondence. Everyone has the right to the protection ofthe law against such interference.&quot;Clearly, in view of the Governments policy that the Convention should defineprecisely the obligations to be undertaken and should avoid broad statements ofprinciple, the Article was unacceptable in this form. It was therefore necessary to try hurriedly to find a better text, and the text which ultimately emerged was basedon the formulation of similar rights in other Articles. In view of the doubtsexpressed during the Cabinefs consideration of the matter, the Foreign Secretaryinstructed the United Kingdom representative at the meeting of officials which preceded the recent meeting of the Committee of Ministers to propose an amend-ment to this Article, extending the permitted restriction of the right to privacy ofthe home and correspondence to cover also &quot; the interests of the economic well-being of the country &quot; and &quot; the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&quot;This proposal was accepted by the other member Governments and the text of thedraft Convention has been amended accordingly.10. Article 11 closely follows the corresponding Article in the United Nationsdraft Covenant and is similar in its effect to Articles 15 and 16 of the UnitedKingdom draft of a Bill of Human Rights published as a non-parliamentary paper
as long ago as June 1947. Indeed, most of the remaining Articles in tb,e Europeandraft Convention dealing with the individual &quot;rights &quot; have their counterparts inthis United Kingdom draft Bill. It was made clear to Parliament by the Minister ofState on 26th February, 1948, that the Government would attempt to secure that no substantial point of any sort put forward in the United Kingdom draft Bill wasomitted from the United Nations Covenant, and the United Kingdom representa-tives both in the United Nations and in the Council of Europe have sought, as faras possible, to keep the United Nations Covenant and the European Conventionuas closely as possible in line with the United Kingdom draft Bill, subject always tothe desire of the Government, as expressed by the Lord Chancellor, to have theobligations of the contracting States set out in precise terms:.&apos; ^: !ki&amp;p11. As regards the question why the draft Convention.should have reachedsuch an advanced &quot;stage of preparation before it was submitted for considerationby Ministers, it will be seen that, with the exception of Article 8j the draft Con-vention contains nothing of substance that was not included in principle in theUnited Kingdom draft Bill mentioned above, with which Ministers have long beenfamiliar. The last conference of official representatives at Strasbourg did notconclude its deliberations until 17th June, and the official representatives were bound, by their terms of reference, to report to the Committee of Ministers, andthere was no intervening stage at which the matter could have been taken out ofthe hands of the Committee of Ministers. They had in effect asked their official representatives to produce something which looked like a possible draft Convention,and the official representatives did so. The next step was for the Committee ofMinisters to decide. The report of the meetings and the draft brief for use by theUnited Kingdom representative on the Committee of Ministers were subsequentlycirculated to the Steering Committee on International Organisations, so that departments could be in a position to submit any proposals for amendment of the text before the matter was considered by the Committee of Ministers. The majorquestion whether the Government could accept the Convention was at the samestage submitted to the Cabinet, special attention being drawn to the provisions relating to petitions, which the United Kingdom representatives had consistentlyopposed at Strasbourg. In this the Steering Committee on International Organisa-tions performed its function as a clearing house for matters of policy at thedepartmental level, final decisions on important matters of policy being submittedto the Cabinet.K.
