Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1953CONFIDENTIALC. (53) 13621st April, 1953THE LEGAL POSITION IN EGYPT    .Memorandum by the Law Officers of the CrownReferring to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum C (53) 120, we agree:  (a) That the Treaty may properly be regarded as still in force.  Even if theretention by us in the Canal Zone after the end of the war and beforethe denunciation of the Treaty of a number of troops in excess of themaximum permitted by the Annex to Article 8 constituted a breach of the Treaty of such a character as would entitle Egypt to regard theTreaty as no longer binding, the Egyptians did not purport to abrogatethe Treaty on this account.(b) That until 1956 negotiations for a revision of the Treaty can only be started by mutual consent.(c) That we are entitled to maintain in the Canal Zone a force sufficient toprotect the interests threatened by Egypfs illegal repudiation so longas such a threat continues.(d) That the question of maintaining our troops in the Canal Zone, if not previously settled by mutual consent, falls to be determined by arbitra-tion in 1956. As the League of Nations does not now exist, the arbitration cannot take place in the absence of agreement between egypt and the United Kingdom upon an arbitrator.2.   We would, however, make the following reservations:  (i) As regards paragraph 2 of the Paper, we have difficulty in accepting thelegal proposition that a Treaty can remain in force with only one partyenjoying rights under it. We would prefer to say that Egypfs purportedrepudiation in 1951 gave us the right to terminate the Treaty, but that since in fact we elected not to do so, the Treaty remains binding on both parties and can be reviewed only in accordance with Article 16.(ii) As regards paragraphs 3 and 4, we suggest that the words &quot; at the requestof either &quot; in the second line of paragraph 3 should read &quot; by mutual agreement.&quot; It seems clear that until 1956 both parties are free tonegotiate or not, as they think fit.(iii) As regards paragraph 7, we do not. think it could be successfully argued that Egypfs action has deprived her of the benefit of her right to goto arbitration in 1956 under Article 8. We elected not to exercise our right to terminate the Treaty. We chose to regard it as continuing inforce. We cannot now contend that it is only in force in so far as we seek to rely on it and that the Egyptians have no rights under it.(iv) The assumption in paragraphs 2 and 7 that arbitration in .1956 would inpractice be carried out by the United Nations may be a reasonable one,but since the United Nations Organisation is not, for the purposes ofthe Treaty, a successor in title of the League of Nations, it cannot betaken for granted that Egypt would accept this without demur and,if she did not, difficulties would obviously arise.L.
