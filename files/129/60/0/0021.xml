THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY  OF  HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   government primed for the Cabinet.   April 1953SECRET Copy No.   ^ j,C. (53) 1228th April, 1953CABINETTHE COLONIAL TERRITORIES AND COMMONWEALTH MEMBERSHIPMemorandum by Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations.- IntroductionAt the request of the Cabinet, I submit a report on the problems involved inthe admission of existing dependent Territories to full Commonwealth Membership(C.C. (52) 93rd Conclusions, Minute 4). The expression &quot; Member of theCommonwealth &quot; is used to describe a Commonwealth country possessing a specialstatus, namely, that of a sovereign independent community, recognised as aseparate international entity, but associated with other Commonwealth countries of the same status in a relationship differing from that existing between foreign states. The formal marks of Membership of the Commonwealth in this specialsense are set out in paragraph 7 below; but for practical purposes the hallmark of membership is the right to be represented at Meetings of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters. The present Members of the Commonwealth are the United Kingdom,Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of SouthAfrica, India, Pakistan and Ceylon. (The Colonies, of course, are part of theCommonwealth, but do not enjoy the status of &quot; Members.&quot;)2. It is the open and declared policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom &quot; to guide the colonial territories to responsible self-government within the Commonwealth in conditions that ensure to the people concerned botha fair standard of living and freedom from oppression from any quarter&quot;(Cmd. 7433, 1948). As has been made clear in more recent Ministerial statements,there is an important practical distinction to be drawn between the grant of self-government (which is a matter for the United Kingdom and the territory concernedalone) and admission to Membership of the Commonwealth (which is a matter forall Members of the Commonwealth). In the case of India, Pakistan and Ceylon, thegrant of complete self-government was in fact followed by admission to Common-wealth Membership, after the fullest exchange of information and consultation withother existing Members of the Commonwealth. Burma, on the other hand, onachieving independence, chose not to seek Commonwealth Membership, though there is no reason to suppose that she could not have secured it if she had wished,and&apos; was allowed to leave the Commonwealth with general consent. Strictlyspeaking, therefore, the declared policy involves (i) an assurance that the UnitedKingdom will be prepared, when the necessary conditions are fulfilled, to grant a territory independence; (ii) a hope that, when this takes place, the territory con-cerned will wish to remain in the Commonwealth and will be accepted as a fellow-Member by the existing Members.II.-Questions for Examination3.   The questions now to be examined are:  (i) In which territories is advance to full Membership of the Commonwealthlikely to become alive issue in the near future?(ii) When are these territories likely to become independent, and when,therefore, is the issue of Membership of the Commonwealth likely tobecome acute?44018b
2(hi) At what steps should other Members of the Commonwealth be broughtinto consultation?(iv) What are the formal marks of Membership of the Commonwealth?(v) What are the obstacles in the way of achievement of full membership of the Commonwealth by the territories concerned? (or, to look atthe question from the point of view of the existing Members, are there any reasons why particular territories should not be admitted to membership?).(vi) If there are difficulties about the admission of particular territories, is theresome new pattern of Commonwealth relationships which would satisfy the aspirations of these territories and yet be acceptable to existing members?These questions are discussed in the following paragraphs.In which territories is advance to full Membership of the Commonwealth likelyto become a live issue in the near future?4. This question can be answered with&apos;some confidence, thus: the gold coast; Nigeria; the Federation of Malaya (with Singapore and perhaps the threeBorneo territories); the prospective Central African and Caribbean Federations.East Africa is a potential candidate^When are these territories likely to become independent and when, therefore, is theissue of Membership of the Commonwealth likely to become acute?5. Experience has shown that, even though a territory may be prepared toaccept for a time an intermediate stage in constitutional progress short of completeself-government, the period at this stage may be of short duration, especially ifexpectations have been aroused by a too precise definition of the ultimate objective.e:g., &quot; Dominion Status,&quot; which can be reiterated as a local slogan. It is very probable that the Gold Coast will be the first to aspire to Membership of theCommonwealth, with Nigeria not far behind, and it would be unwise to assume that the issue may not arise within the next five years or even less. The Federationof Malaya may come into the picture soon after the present emergency is ended.The Central African and Caribbean Federations, if established will also be potentialcandidates. Some period of settling down will clearly be necessary before thegrant of independence becomes a practical possibility; but there is no doubt thatany claim by, e.g., the Gold Coast or Nigeria to full Membership would instantlyevoke a similar claim from the Central African Federation. No early development on these lines is probable in East Africa, where for the present demands are likelyto be for extended local self-government rather than for independence in external affairs.At what stage should other Members of the Commonwealth be brought into consultation?6. It would seem to follow from what has been said above that Members ofthe Commonwealth may have to be brought to consider, if not to declare, theirattitude towards the possible admission of a territory to Membership in advance ofits having achieved self-government. Yet. early formal consultation would have itsdangers since it would be difficult to separate the issue of Membership from that ofself-government at this stage and the result might be disagreement and a prolongeddeadlock, during which the United Kingdom Government would have to deal asbest it could with the unsatisfied and increasingly importunate demands of the terri-tory under consideration. Since there can be no question of Commonwealthobjections barring constitutional progress towards self-government, the dilemmacan probably best be resolved by avoiding formal consultation about Membershipuntil that question is really imminent, while ensuring that other Commonwealth* Malta has not been overlooked, but although, apart from Southern Rhodesia, Malta is theterritory furthest advanced constitutionally and, in fact, one of its political parties favours dominion status, its small size, its position as a fortress island and the economic dependence on the UnitedKingdom which results from this, seem to preclude for it a state of complete independence. HisMajesty&apos;s Government said in 1947 that they, did not consider that it would be appropriate totransfer responsibility for the affairs of Malta to the Dominions Office (now commonwealth relations Office) (Malta: Statement of Policy on Constitutional Reform (Cmd. 7014)),
Members are taken at an early stage into full confidence over the policy and plans of the United Kingdom for the constitutional progress of its territories. This is thepresent practice.What are the formal marks of Membership of the Commonwealth?7.  These may be summarised as follows:-Intra-Commonwealth(a) Full  Legislative   independence  as   provided  in   the   Statute  of westminster.(b) The right to advise the Queen direct,(c) Representation at Prime Ministers Meetings and on Commonwealthbodies.(d) Appointment  of  High  Commissioners  in  other  commonwealth countries.(e) Obligation to consult other Governments on matters of common concern and right to be consulted by them.(/) Separate Citizenship.: International(g) Admissibility to the United Nations and to International bodies.(h) Conclusion of own treaties.(/) Appointment of diplomatic representatives.(j) Conduct of own foreign policy, including right of neutrality.What are the obstacles in the way of achievement of full Membership., of theCommonwealth by the territories concerned? (Or, to look at the question from the point of view of the existing Members, are. there any reasons whyparticular territories should not. be admitted to Membership?)8. Since consultation between existing Members of the Commonwealth isessential before a new Member can be admitted, it is necessary to consider the like-lihood of securing unanimous agreement, and for this purpose to endeavour to assess the probable reactions of other Governments. The Gold Coast is taken asthe obvious test case. So far as the Union of South Africa is concerned, it is clearthat the admission of territories governed by Africans would be unacceptable tothe present Government, and it cannot be assumed that any alternative Governmentwould take a different view. This would probably apply equally in the case of any territory where the population has considerable admixture of African blood, e.g.,the West Indies. Canada might in principle give a half-hearted blessing to the promotion of a territory while not viewing with favour the practical effects.Australia and New Zealand might on general grounds be prepared to follow the lead of the United Kingdom, but this cannot be predicted with certainty. India,Pakistan and Ceylon, particularly India, would, no doubt, applaud any step whichtended to end &quot; colonialism.&quot;9. The crucial issue would be the question of attendance at meetings of commonwealth Prime Ministers which are to the outside world the most visiblesign of Members of the Commonwealth working in collaboration. The power ofthe Members of the Commonwealth to exercise a decisive influence in world affairs depends to great extent upon these public demonstrations of solidarity bythe whole Commonwealth. Any diminution in such manifestations could not fail to be interpreted by foreign countries as a sign of disintegration and so lead to a disastrous weakening in that influence. Yet the harmony and authority so success-fully achieved would be threatened by the expansion of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters&apos; Meetings to a point when they no longer consisted of a small number oflike-minded people but became unwieldy in size and represented too manydisparities both of outlook and of capacity or willingness to discharge the respon-sibilities inherent in Commonwealth Membership.10. It is indeed necessary to envisage an even more serious possibility,namely, that some Members of the Commonwealth would not only withdraw from participation in Prime Ministers&apos; Meetings and other Commonwealth bodies, but would withdraw from the Commonwealth altogether. Thus it might be found,to put the problem bluntly, that the Commonwealth would have to choose between44018
4/4the rejection of some of the former dependent territories as new Members, andadmission of new Members resulting in the withdrawal of some existing Members.// there are difficulties about the admission of particular territories, is there some new pattern of Commonwealth relationships which would satisfy the aspira-tions of these territories and yet be acceptable to the existing Members?11. It might be thought that the answer to this question could be found ina &quot; two-tier Membership,&quot; in which the countries in the second tier would become members of the Commonwealth, but would not possess all the normal attributesof Membership referred to in paragraph 5 (iv); notably . (a) they would not be entitled to representation at general meetings of thePrime Ministers of the present Member countries:(b) they would have no obligation to consult the present Member governments on matters of common concern, and no right to be consulted by them.12. The objection to any overt distinction would be that it would beimpossible to avoid the impression that countries in the second tier were of inferiorstatus to the others or to prevent pressure for their promotion to the first tier,especially if the line of demarcation were the stage of social and economic develop-ment reached. Territories governed by Africans would undoubtedly assume thatthey were being kept down on grounds of race. The only safe assumption is thatthe offer of anything short of full Membership would be unacceptable. This neednot mean that there could not be (as indeed there are now) differences in practicebetween the treatment of different Members in such matters as the exchange ofsecret information. Nor does it preclude the possibility of establishing some half-way status (including perhaps the right of advising the Sovereign on internal affairs and of appointing representatives in London and other Commonwealth capitals)which would satisfy, perhaps for a considerable time, the aspirations of territoriesunable to assume the full burden of independence.III. General Conclusions13. Our aims are to preserve the existing degree of Commonwealth solidarity,while at the same time securing and retaining the active friendship and support ofthe peoples of the present Dependencies at all stages of constitutional evolution.These aims may in the end prove to be incompatible, and a choice will then have tobe made. But we should use what period of grace we have to try to avoid beingfaced with such a choice. There is at present a tacit assumption that, when a colonial territory reaches the position that Ceylon had reached at the end of 1947,it will be granted independence by the United Kingdom and will be accepted asa Member of the Commonwealth if it wishes. This assumption will be fortifiedby the terms of the preamble to the proposed constitution of the Central african federation. Whether or not in any particular instance the assumption will provein practice to be well founded is likely to depend as much on the time and circum-stances in which the issue is raised as upon theoretical considerations.15. The United Kingdom herself must be regarded as morally committed tosponsoring the admission to Commonwealth Membership of any of the presentdependencies which may achieve independence. If it is agreed that this is so, andthat the acceptance of such territories as Commonwealth Members is in the UnitedKingdom interests, it follows that (1) nothing should be done to disturb the existing tacit assumption;(2) we should do our best to prevent the question from being raised publiclyas a hypothetical one;(3) we should endeavour to arrange that, when it has to be raised as a practicalissue affecting a particular territory, this takes place at a time and in circumstances which offer the best prospect of a successful outcome.16. The Commonwealth Relations Office and Colonial Office should thereforewatch carefully political developments in the advanced Colonial territories. TheColonial Office should continue to encourage the territories to accept politicalprogress by stages, and should seek, by judicious and carefully timed concessions
la.of progressive self-government in domestic affairs, to forestall demands for Mem-befship which other Members could fairly reject as premature, while at the sametime avoiding the appearance of weakly yielding to extremist pressure. It may befound that, if their reasonable aspirations towards internal self-government aresatisfied, and if we can develop the present, practice of giving them opportunities of representation when matters affecting their interests are being discussed, Colonialpoliticians will not in fact be over-anxious to assume the responsibilities as well asthe privileges of external independence.17. The fact remains, however, that as indicated in paragraphs 8-10, we mustbe prepared to find ourselves faced at any moment with a serious situation. Atworst, we may be confronted by two almost equally disagreeable and indeeddisastrous alternatives, namely:  (a) the admission of former dependent territories to full Membership of theCommonwealth at the cost of the withdrawal of South Africa and the dissolution for all practical purposes of the existing structure of theCommonwealth, or ,(b) the rejection of the claims of such territories at the cost of their withdrawal from the Commonwealth, accompanied in all probability by the threeAsiatic Members.18. The British Commonwealth is a great force in the world to-day and a powerful ally in the American partnership and the North Atlantic treaty organisation because of the strength and unity of purpose of the United Kingdomand the &quot; old &quot; Dominions. If we do not now forestall the danger, the Common-wealth may be brought to a point when we and the &quot; old &quot; Dominions have to choose between whittling away the reality of the Commonwealth partnership tovanishing point, or risking the defection of the Asian and African peoples. If sucha choice had to be made, I have no doubt that we should seek to preserve the solidarity of the &quot; old &quot; Dominions and ourselves at any cost. But even this might in such a contingency be impracticable, and we might find that we had got the worst of both worlds and lost&apos; both the &quot; old &quot; Dominions and the new.19. To avert or forestall such a dilemma, no possibility of escaping from itshould be left unexplored. The possibility mentioned in paragraphs 11 and 12,though emphasising that the only safe assumption on which to proceed is that nothing less than full Membership would be acceptable, is the establishment ofsome intermediate status which might satisfy, at any rate for some considerable time,, the aspirations of territories unable to assume the full burden of independence in concrete terms. Might it not be possible to come to some arrangement with,e.g., the Gold Coast and Nigeria whereby the grant by us of independence to them would be accompanied on their side by voluntary surrender to us of control over their foreign relations and. defence, thus on the one hand satisfying their amour-propre so far as status was concerned, while on the other hand meeting the validobjections to their automatic admission to the arcana imperil, the meetings of commonwealth Prime Ministers, which are mainly concerned with defence andforeign affairs? I only throw out this suggestion as one of various possibilitieswhich I think should be more fully examined.20. Another possibility would be to extend the term &quot; Membership of theCommonwealth &quot; to cover not only the existing Members but any territory whichbecomes independent and agrees to remain in the Commonwealth. The &quot; mark &quot;of Membership of the Club would not be admission to Prime Ministers&apos; meetingsbut the right to advise the Sovereign directly and to exchange representatives withother Commonwealth (and possibly foreign) countries. Other &quot; marks &quot; applicableto all Members may be capable of introduction. On the analogy of the united nations Security Council, the Club would have a Committee of permanent members (the Prime Ministers of the existing Dominions). The junior members would not have permanent seats on the Committee, but would be representedcollectively. One way of doing this would be for them to be represented by theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. Another and perhaps more acceptable (to them) way would be a system of elective or rotational representation:This would not, however, be practicable until at least three or four junior members had come into being.21. The weakness of our present position is aclmittedly the precedent, set bythe admission of Ceylon to full Membership.   We cannot, however, go back oh
Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,8th April, 1953.that. This being so, it is desirable to avoid, if possible, any one territory becoming a test case of our future intentions. We should try to arrange matters so that atleast three territories (say Nigeria, Gold Coast and Malaya) come up for election to junior Membership at the same time, so that they can be dealt with in oneoperation and with a consistent policy which can then be extended to others as they come along.22. I have tried in the latter part of this paper to devise some means by whichTerritories could be induced to accept something short of full Membership of theCommonwealth, by which I mean, something short of equal status with the majorCommonwealth countries and being entitled to participate as fully as the others in commonwealth conferences and discussions. I have attempted this because I must assume that these lesser countries would continue in their progress towards &quot; inde-pendence &quot; (though I would hope at a less rapid rate than under the SocialistGovernment), however little they are really fitted for independence or capable ofsustaining the responsibilities and duties which should attach to Commonwealthstatus. I must admit that I see great difficulty in getting the lesser countries toagree to any two-tier system, particularly if the Asiatic countries urge them the other way. But the issues at stake are so serious that we should do our utmost, in secretconsultation with the &quot; old &quot; Dominions, to arrive at an agreed policy before thesematters become as may happen at any time the subject of public and almost certainly controversial discussion. Before we talk to the &quot; old &quot; Dominions, weshould be agreed among ourselves I therefore ask that the whole matter shouldbe further considered at the highest level.23. The Foreign Secretary and the Colonial Secretary are in general agree-ment with this paper as a basis for further study. I have also consulted the lord president, who is in general agreement with it.SWINTON.
