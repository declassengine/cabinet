(53) 13016th April, 1953CABINETATOMIC   ENERGY:   FUTURE  POLICY   TOWARDS   THEBELGIAN CONGO URANIUM AGREEMENTNote by the Paymaster general  attach a report by the Official Committee on Atomic Energy dealing withour future policy towards the Belgian Congo Uranium Agreement. This raisesa particular problem to be considered in the light of the decision taken on generalexternal policy in atomic energy matters, which is discussed in C. (53) 129.C.
ATOMIC   ENERGY:   FUTURE  POLICY   TOWARDS   THEBELGIAN CONGO URANIUM AGREEMENTReport by the Official Committee on Atomic energy the United Kingdom has been associated as an equal partner with the UnitedStates in the inter-Governmental Agreement of 1944 for the supply of Congouranium and in the contracts signed under that Agreement. A brief account of anglo-American relations with the Belgian Government and with the AfricanMetals Corporation is given in the annex to this report. The Agreement and thecurrent contract end in February 1956 but, owing to American impatience,negotiations for a renewal of the inter-Governmental Agreement are about to start. It is necessary to reach an early decision on the attitude which the UnitedKingdom should take in these negotiations.2. In the general paper being submitted to Ministers on &quot;Atomic Energy:Future External Policy &quot; (Annex to C. (53) 129) the case is set out for drawing theUnited Kingdom&apos;s future uranium supplies from the Commonwealth (paragraph 15)and for not spreading our small requirement so as to take any uranium from theBelgian Congo after 1956 (paragraph 20). It must be remembered that we havenot&apos;taken any Congo uranium since 1947; that this is known to the Belgians and americans; and that the Belgians must suspect that our 50 per cent, financial interest in Congo production is completely unrealistic and is depriving them of dollars for part of the uranium which they are supplying to the United States.It seems therefore that we must say frankly to the Belgians and Americans thatwe are not likely to need any appreciable quantity of Congo uranium.3. In these circumstances the most logical course might be to say that we did not wish to be parties to the new agreement or to any future contracts andthat we preferred to leave them to be negotiated exclusively between the Belgiansand the Americans.4. On the other hand, there are broad political arguments in favour of our being parties&apos; to the new agreements and it may well be that the Belgians would prefer it. To do so, if we can, would:  (a) maintain normal United Kingdom participation in all Combined Develop-ment Agency arrangements, except in the essential role of a buyer ofCongo uranium;(b) keep open the possibility of our asking for small amounts of Congouranium in the future, although we have taken none since 1947 andseem likely to need none in any foreseeable future;(c) maintain our position as joint advisers to the Belgians in atomic energymatters, although we could do this without necessarily being parties tothe Agreement.5. There is the further consideration that, as is explained in paragraph 1above, we are considering an agreement which would, begin to operate only in years&apos; time and which will probably regulate the sale of Congo ores over the succeeding 10 years. It might be deemed premature to take a decision in 1953which would in effect involve severing our connection with the Belgians in regardto uranium supplies for a period beginning in 1956 and extending to as far aheadas 1966.6.. It is, however, possible that the Americans would object to nominalparticipation. It might perhaps be difficult to make an effective claim to a share in such an agreement unless we paid some share (though considerably less than50 per cent.) of the capital advances to the African Metals Corporation. though these advances are ultimately repaid, we have to decide whether the political and long-term considerations outlined in paragraphs 4 and 5 are likely in 1956 andsucceeding years to justify us in making loans which might have to be paid in gold,particularly as we may soon be hard put to it to keep - pace with the capitaladvances required under existing Commonwealth uranium agreements.
7. If the general policy set out in the paper &quot;Atomic Energy: Future ExternalPolicy &quot; is approved, it is therefore necessary to ask Ministers to decide whetherthe application of this policy to Congo uranium should lead us to (i) withdraw entirely from the negotiations for the renewal of the agreement;or(ii) seek to become a party to the agreement, at some financial cost.In either case, we should make it clear to the Americans and the Belgians that wedo not propose to take any substantial quantity of Belgian Congo uranium. Ifcourse (ii) were adopted, the matter would have to be reconsidered if objections were raised by either the Americans or the Belgians.(Signed)        PIERSON DIXON,Chairman of the official committee on Atomic Energy.2nd April, 1953.ANNEXMain Provisions of the Agreements between the United States, UnitedKingdom and Belgium in the Atomic Energy FieldIn the atomic energy field, relations between the United States and the UnitedKingdom on the one hand and Belgium on the other, began during the war andarose from the desire of the United States and the United Kingdom to securecontrol of the entire output of uranium from the Belgian Congo as an instrument of war. These relations are at present governed by the following arrangements: -(i) the Inter-Governmental Agreement of 1944, which expires in February1956;(ii) a series of contracts ending concurrently, for the supply of Congo uraniumore;(iii) the Memorandum of Understanding of 13th July, 1951.The Inter-Governmental Agreement2. By an exchange of letters in London on 26th September, 1944, the BelgianGovernment concluded a &quot; memorandum of agreement &quot; (to be treated as a militarysecret) with the United States and United Kingdom Governments, granting the two latter the first refusal of uranium and thorium ores produced in the Belgian Congofor the period of an initial contract and for 10 years thereafter; Belgium reservedthe right to retain reasonable quantities of uranium ore for her own scientific research, and for industrial purposes other than atomic energy. There is no restriction on the use by the United States and United Kingdom of uranium orefor &quot; military and strategic purposes,&quot; but in the event of these Governmentsdeciding to use the ores from Belgian sources &quot; as a source of energy for commercial purposes,&quot; they would &quot; admit the Belgian Government to participation in suchutilisation on equitable terms &quot;; conversely, if the Belgian Government contemplate the use of the ores as a source of energy, they will use them only in agreementwith the United States and United Kingdom Governments.The Congo Contracts3. The Congo contracts were signed between the Combined DevelopmentAgency (C.D.A.) on the one hand, representing the United States and UnitedKingdom Governments, and on the other the African Metals Corporation, trieselling organisation of the Union Miniere du Haut Katanga. The Corporationundertook to supply specified quantities of uranium oxide to the C.D.A., which,
in return, agreed to make capital grants for the development of the mine. Thecurrent contract is due to expire on 15th February, 1956, and the inter-Govern-mental agreement will end concurrently. The contracts require that the uraniumbe paid for 50 per cent, in dollars and 50 per cent, in sterling, but C.D.A. accountsare adjusted later so that each country is ultimately charged for the uraniumallocated to it. Since February 1946 the C.D.A. has purchased from the Belgiansapproximately 15,000 tons of uranium, of which 3,250 tons have been shipped tothe United Kingdom and the remainder to the United States. A further 4,500 tons is likely to be produced up to February 1956 and shipped to the United States.Thus, the United States will have taken approximately five-sixths of the ore; but since the Belgians will have received only 50 per cent, of the value of the orein dollars they have reason to be dissatisfied with the terms of the existing contracts.The Memorandum of Understanding of 13th July 19514. The Belgian Government has from time to time pressed for technical assistance in implementation of that part of the 1944 Agreement which relates to the eventual industrial use of Congo uranium and after prolonged discussions in 1950-51 a &quot;memorandum of understanding&quot; was drawn up in July 1951whereby the United States and United Kingdom Governments agreed, inter alia,to provide a greater degree of technical assistance (mainly declassified information)and closer liaison in the atomic field. The three Governments also agreed to holdfurther talks from time to time to bring about closer association &quot; as soon as future developments warrant&quot; and the memorandum included an interpretation of the1944 agreement to the effect that &quot; when the three Governments are agreed thatthe United States and United Kingdom Governments have decided to employuranium ores for commercial purposes, the Belgian Government will have an equalright to utilise uranium ores for the same purposes.&quot;5. The Belgians, although aware that the United States receive the majorshare of the Congo ore, have looked to the United Kingdom in the first place for technical assistance with their reactor programme. The McMahon Act debarsthe Americans from passing on any classified information, but tripartite discussions are taking place in Washington in the middle of April at which the Belgians proposeto seek the assistance of the United States as well as ourselves in the constructionof a power reactor of the 5-10 megawatt level, or alternatively a more elaboratereactor using enriched uranium. It is probable that the Americans will take full advantage of the amendment to the McMahon Act to pass on such classifiedinformation as the Belgians may require as a quid pro quo for continued maximumsupplies of Congo uranium.
