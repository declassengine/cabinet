1MFREER TRADE AND CURRENCIES: ROLE OF UNITED STATESPOLICIESSection I. IntroductionOrigin and Scope of memorandum. In the discussions held in Washington in March this year the Governmentsof the United States and the United Kingdom considered together measures for creating economic and financial conditions under which the countries of the free world would be enabled to earn their own living by their own industry. the communique issued after the discussions recorded their agreement that &quot; thesolution of the economic problems of the free world is vital to its security and wellbeing.&quot; The two Governments also agreed that sound internal policies by bothdebtor and creditor countries and the expansion and freeing of world trade andcurrencies were essential elements in the creation of a workable and productiveeconomic system within the free world; and the United Kingdom Governmentwere invited to set forth as specifically as possible what changes in United Statestrade and commercial policies would help the United Kingdom and the rest of the sterling area to increase exports to the United States.2. This memorandum is submitted in response to that invitation; but its scope is somewhat wider, for the following reasons. In effect there are only two major international currencies: the United States dollar and the pound sterling,and about one-half of all international transactions is financed in sterling. Theresult is that, when dollars are scarce, countries outside the sterling area and the dollar area seek to transfer the burden of that scarcity to the sterling area by con-converting sterling in their possession into dollars. Thus sterling is affected not only by lack of balance between the sterling area and the United States but also by lackof balance in United States transactions with the rest of the world; and theimportance of these transactions with third countries would become even greaterif sterling were made generally convertible. Over 80 per cent, of United Statespayments for imports go to countries outside the sterling area. The sterling area andthe United Kingdom in particular must look to third markets as wellx as to theUnited States for the required increase in their dollar income. In this theUnited Kingdom would be helped by the emergence of a multilateraltrading pattern on the lines indicated by the United Kingdom Government inthe Washington discussions on freer trade and currencies. This memorandumtherefore sets out United Kingdom views about the ways in which theUnited States Government could assist a general advance to expanded andfreer trade and currencies and discusses more particularly how the sterling areacould be enabled to earn enough &quot;dollars, either direct from the United States orfrom third countries, to sustain the convertibility of sterling and to eliminateprogressively discrimination against imports from the United States.United States Trade Policies3. The United States economy is now the strongest in the world and wouldseem to have nothing to fear from the limited competition which the rest of the free world can offer. Moreover, in view of the strength of the United States economy and balance of payments in relation to those of other countries, the United King-dom Government suggests that it would not be appropriate to make changes inUnited States trade and commercial policies contingent on similar action by debtorcountries; indeed to do so would probably defeat the very objects which thosechanges were intended to secure. The United Kingdom Government believe thatthe changes suggested in this memorandum would, when fully developed, take theplace of the economic aid which the United States, with generosity and foresight,have provided since the end of World War II, and by enabling the countries of thefree world to earn their own living by their own efforts would increase their selfrespect, strength and cohesion and encourage their resistance to communism. TheUnited Kingdom Government believes that a most valuable opportunity now exists for sustained action throughout the field of trade and commercial policies to Createconditions for the fulfilment of the joint objectives of both Governments.
Section II. The Importance of the Level of United States Business Activity4. In making an advance to expanded and freer trade and currencies it isessential first to make secure the base on which the advance is made. More than50 per cent, of the industrial production of the free world is concentrated in .theUnited States which also take 20 per cent, of the exports of the rest of the free world. There can be no hope of steadily expanding world trade in an economicallyunified free world unless a high and expanding level of business activity is main-tained in the United States. Such is the economic preponderance of the UnitedStates in the free world that even moderate adjustments in the level of United Statesbusiness activity have a profound effect on the economies of other free countrieswhen they are translated into terms of United States imports and the dollar earnings of the outside world. In the past few years the United States have been successful in maintaining comparative stability combined with a rising level of businessactivity. While debtor countres must, by curbing inflation, restrain a tendency toover-import, complementary policies in creditor countries, in particular the UnitedStates, require the maintenance of business activity at a level at which a high and.expanding level of imports will be possible. In a dynamic and developing economylike the United States some fluctuation in activity is inevitable, but the UnitedKingdom Government earnestly hope that it will be an objective of United Statespolicies to keep this fluctuation as small as possible so that the shortage of dollarsin the rest of the free world will not prove too great to be manageable by theadoption of suitable trade and commercial measures and the use of such exchange resources as may be available.Section III. United States Balance of PaymentsGeneral5. It is the responsibility of the countries of the free world outside the UnitedStates, while avoiding the social and economic evils of deflation, to take adaquatemeasures to eliminate inflationary pressures and to expand their export capabilities.Even, however, when they have done this there will remain, for some time at least,a surplus in United States current transactions with the outside world. Unless thisis covered in some other way it must be paid for in gold, but this would provide nocontinuing or ultimate solution since the gold reserves in these countries are alreadymuch too low, and other measures would quickly have to be taken. These other measures would be likely to take the form of increasing restrictions on trade and payments, which it is the joint objective of the United States and the United kingdom governments to reduce progressively. Unless constructive means to bridge thisdollar gap are provided there is a serious risk that it will be closed only at a danger-ously low levei of trade.Balance of Payments in Previous Years i6. United States surpluses on. current account with foreign countries, whichaveraged $4,000 million a year over the four years to 1951 (roughly the period ofMarshall Aid) and amounted to $2,000 million in 1952, have been more thancovered by United States grants, gifts and investment (Annex I). Thus over thisperiod the aggregate gold and dollar holdings of the free world outside the UnitedStates have increased from the very low level to which they had fallen. The taskhow is to adjust the various factors in the balance of payments between the UnitedStates and the rest of the world so that the balance will rest more on trade.7. It is not possible to measure precisely this task over the next few years since there are many uncertain factors. Moreover, any assessment would clearlyneed to be adjusted from time to time in the light of changing conditions. Never-theless it may be of value to illustrate the order of magnitude of the task, and the changes which would be needed to weave into the pattern more trade and less aid.For this purpose it seems appropriate to take the 1952 position as the starting point,since by then post-war reconstruction had been substantially completed, inflation inthe free world was being contained, and United States business activity was at ahigh level. In consequence the United States surplus on overseas current account,in 1952 was very much lower than the average of the preceding four years; but
there Were still &quot; abnormal &quot; factors operating on the United States balance of pay-ments in the shape of economic aid, extraordinary United States military expendi-tures overseas, and restrictions on United States imports into other countries of thefree world. An illustrative calculation of the United States annual surplus on over-seas current account over the next three or four years, which allows for the progressive reduction of these abnormal factors, is given in Annex II. The con-clusion is that even in favourable circumstances the gap to be closed by UnitedStates investment overseas and additional United States imports would be in the region of $4,000 million-$5,000 million. Such an estimate must clearly be subjectto a wide margin of error, and furthermore it is based on a number of importantassumptions as set out in Annex II.Section IV.   Means by which Non-Dollar Countries can earn more Dollars8. The provision of the flow of dollars suggested above, of the order of $4,000million to $5,000 million per annum, must be achieved in the two fields of (A)investment and (B) goods and services.Sub-Section A. InvestmentPrivate Investment9. Private investment is already playing an important role in providingdollars for the outside world. In 1952 it contributed over $800 million. But thiskind of investment has since World War II been subject to significant limitations.The bulk of the investment (about 2/3rds) has taken place in the western hemisphere, particularly in Canada. Petroleum and the extractive industries haveabsorbed a large part of it. Almost all the investment has been direct industrial investment; other investment has been small. The proportion of United Statesprivate investment overseas to United States domestic investment is now very low,about 2 per cent, as against 4 per cent, in the 1920&apos;s.10. The need for more private United States overseas investment has beenthe subject of many studies; and the limiting factors are now well known. Theyare, the attractive yields obtainable inside the United States, the uncertain climate for investment in many foreign countries, and the difficulties arising out of the incon-vertibility of many currencies. The countries of the sterling area have for their part sought, as far as practicable, to reduce the obstacles to foreign investment:profits have always been freely remittable and some other countries of the sterling area have followed the lead of the United Kingdom in allowing the repatriation ofcapital and capital profits on approved investments made after 1st January, .1950.The United Kingdom Government will be ready to discuss in a constructive spiritany proposals which may emerge from the studies which the United StatesGovernment are making in this field.Institutional and Governmental Investment11. Long-term governmental and institutional lending made available to the outside world about $400 million net from United States in 1952. In this con-nection it is necessary to bear in mind that the repayment of loans, which theUnited States Government made during and since World War II is now reaching a high level, over $400 million per annum. The difficulties and uncertaintiessurrounding private investment make it all the more desirable that steps shouldbe taken to maintain and increase productive overseas investment and lendingover which the United States Government have more control, either directly or indirectly. This might be done through an extension of the range and scope oflending through such agencies as the Export-Import Bank, the Mutual SecurityAgency, and the Defence Materials Procurement Agency, and by ensuring that the dollar-lending operations of the International Bank are not restricted through ashortage, or the high cost, of dollar funds.The Limitations of Investment Measures12. The use of investment measures to help close the dollar gap is attractive.Although development overseas, financed by United States capital, takes time tobear fruit, the mere act of investment itself can immediately place at the disposal
of the outside world a supply of dollars. Investment measures thus can operatemuch more quickly than trade measures. But investment measures suffer fromsignificant disadvantages and limitations: these arise partly from the techniqueand procedures followed by some United States institutions and partly from thenature of the process itself. Investment by itself cannot solve the problem ofimbalance between United States and the rest of the world. Indeed, withoutappropriate complementary trade and development policies, it could make theproblem worse, since the recipient countries must earn or save additional dollars to service the investment.Tied Loans and Investments13. It is almost inevitable that part of the dollars constituting UnitedStates investment abroad should immediately flow back to the United Stateseconomy. These dollars are used to purchase additional United States goods and services and do not become available for general trade. This natural tendency isunfortunately reinforced by the practice of tied loans which is generally followedby the Export-Import Bank. As a result the other countries of the free worldare denied an opportunity of earning these dollars in third countries. The UnitedKingdom Government suggest it would be to the advantage of the United Statesand the whole free world if dollars lent or provided by United States agencies andgovernmental institutions were available for expenditure in the cheapest and bestsource of supply. Tied loans may create advantageous terms for particular UnitedStates exports: but they are not in the interests of United States export trade asa whole. Dollars put out as capital or credit into the outside world will returneventually to the United States. If they go out untied they will do more workfor world trade generally and when they do return it will be in payment for UnitedStates exports which win their way on their own merits. This policy would leadto the fostering of activities where they would be most economic in the free world,and would enable countries like the United Kingdom to earn dollars from third countries and thus be more able to play their part in a world-wide multilateralsystem of trade and payments.14. There seems no possibility that the rate of United States investmentoverseas could be increased sufficiently in the forseeable future to bridge the prospective gap between United States overseas receipts and payments on current account. Some investments, indeed, may not do anything at all to bridge the gap if the additional dollars are simply used to make additional purchases inthe United States. The total amount of Government and private long-term loansoverseas by the United States was only about $1,200 million in 1952; but, as was seen in paragraph 7 above, the gap to be bridged is of the order of $4,000 million-$5,000 million. The gap to be covered by increased United States import of goods and services can hardly be less than $3,000 million.Sub-Section B. Goods and Services15. An increase of the magnitude just suggested in the dollar earnings of the outside world from the United States will require a major and sustained effort on the part of exporting countries. It will involve intensification of development and production of raw materials, of which the United States will have increasingneed. As far as manufactured goods are concerned it will involve fuller utilisation of all available resources and the re-deployment of productive capacity.16. In this context it must be emphasised that the export trade of the rest ofthe free world to the United States is almost entirely in the hands of private enter-prise. Businessmen will not proceed vigorously with the necessary development andre-deployment unless they feel reasonably assured that in the United States theywill find a stable long-term market for competitive goods and services and thatsuccessful development of the United States market will not be frustrated by united States policies inimical to imports. Despite the considerable changes inUnited States policies since the 1930s the era of the Smoot-Hawley tariff -theUnited States are still regarded by exporters of all nations as a hazardous andimpermanent market because they fear that any success they may initially achievewill be cut short by protective legislation.
17. The two next Sections deal in detail with cases in which a reduction ofthe United States tariff, and adjustments in other laws and procedures,could increase the dollar earning opportunities of the rest of the world.Even if all the relaxations suggested in these next two Sections are put into opera-tion, the repercussions on the United States internal economy will not be significant. In the case of manufactured goods it has been estimated (the BellReport) that the displacement of domestic goods would be a small fraction of1 per cent, of United States output.18. In the field of invisible imports into United States, shipping is the mainsector in which suitable adjustments of United States policies could lead to a notableincrease in the dollar earnings of other countries of the free world. Cargo carried by United States ships annually now amounts to between 50-60 million tons ascompared with rather less than 19 million tons in 1938. This marked change is,of course, attributable to other factors but it has been fostered by the artificialmeans discussed in paragraphs 34 to 36 below. The importance of this item inthe United States balance of payments with the rest of the world may be gaugedfrom the fact that, whereas the United States made a net payment of $36 million in 1938 to the rest of the world for shipping services, it received for such servicesover $300 million net in 1952.19. An increase to be achieved over the next three or four years on the scalesuggested in paragraph 14 in the intake of normal goods and services by the UnitedStates would seem to be a realistic aim, and not incapable of achievement. we hope it may be met, to some extent at any rate, through a natural increase in importsas economic activity in the United States expands; and there may be some increasein invisible earnings by the outside world, including sectors which give rise to nointernal difficulties in the United States, e.g., tourism. It is, however, most unlikelythat anything like the required increase could be achieved without considerablechanges in United States commercial policies which would encourage an increasein the proportion of United States imports to United States national income.Section V. The Impact of the Tariff on Dollar Earning OpportunitiesThe Tariff General20. The most obvious way in which to increase trade opportunities for othercountries to earn dollars is a reduction in the United States tariff. Apart fromdefence considerations, international justification of any tariff should in the viewof the United Kingdom Government be considered in relation to the economicand financial circumstances of the country concerned: e.g., whether it needs toprotect infant industries, whether it enjoys a stable and expanding economy anda strong creditor position. On this basis it would be reasonable to expect UnitedStates to pursue a &quot; low-tariff &quot; or &quot; no-tariff &quot; policy. Figures are sometimesquoted to prove that the United States tariff is already low, e.g., that the average level of the tariff, including the &quot; free &quot; items, was X9\ per cent, in 1932 and is5i per cent. now. It is true that considerable reductions in a previously high tariffhave been negotiated with the United States since 1932 and that the incidence of specific.and compound rates has in any case been materially lessened by the general increase in price levels. But such average figures based on actual imports aremisleading because they mask the existence of high rates in certain important-categories and they take no account of the effect of rates which are so high thatthey prohibit imports. A more realistic view of the practical effect of the tariffcan be based on examination of individual existing rates. There are at least 138items in the United States tariff which still carry an ad valorem duty or its equivalent of 60 per cent, or more. A list of these is given in Annex III. Of these 138 items,the import figures for 1951 show nil or negligible returns in 83 cases. And thereare approximately 500 tariff rates which exceed 50 per cent, ad valorem or its equivalent.Analysis of United States Visible Imports21. The effect of the United States Tariff on import expansion can be con-veniently considered by reference to two main groups of United States imports,that is, food and fuel and raw materials on the one hand and manufactured, and semi-manufactured goods on the other.  The following table shows the scale of
8Haw Materals			($ million)including fuel	Manufac-		and petroleum	tures	Misc.

The table above shows that raw materials, fuel and food account for about70 per cent, of the exports from the rest of the world to the United States. Thepreponderance of raw materials, fuel and food among the exports of the sterling area to the United States is similar. The dollar earning opportunities of the free world in the raw materials category are especially affected by the regularity or other-wise of United States buying, and also by the level of United States business activity and any schemes for securing greater regularity of purchases and stability of prices should therefore be sympathetically examined. Even in this field, however, thereare tariff impediments to imports.23. Among raw materials imports into the United States wool is one of the biggest. In 1952 it accounted for $382 million, i.e., about 12 per cent, of the totalimports of basic materials. The existing tariff on wool is bound to depress thevolume of wool imports and artificially to stimulate the usage of synthetic fibres bythe United States textile industry. The amount of these duties varies according tothe type and grade of wool and it is, therefore, difficult to give a precise estimate ofthe ad, valorem incidence of the tariff but calculated on 1952 price ranges it was approximately 20 per cent. An application to the Tariff Commission underSection 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act for an increase in these duties isnow under consideration and this threat of increase has naturally caused dismayboth to countries exporting raw wool and to those exporting wool manufactures whowould also be affected-by a corresponding increase in the rate of the specific dutyon raw wool.Among the areas of the free world outside the United States the sterling area is the most seriously affected by the wool tariff. In 1952 the sterling area earnedabout $270 million by providing over 70 per cent, of United States imports of rawwool and the United Kingdom earned about $67 million by providing nearly40 per cent, of United States imports of manufactured and semi-manufactured woolgoods.24. There are several other import taxes which affect imports in the rawmaterial, food and fuel categories.There is an import tax (at present in abeyance) of 2 cents per lb. (about per cent, ad valorem) on copper. With the development of its copper production the Sterling Area will become increasingly interested in the possibilities of exportingcopper to the United States. The United Kingdom Government, therefore, hopethat there would be prior consultation between the two Governments if any questionof reviving this duty arose. There are also import duties on lead (1 1 /16 cents per lb.. or about 6 per cent, ad valorem) and zinc ( 5 cents per lb. or about 8 per cent.ad valorem) where the desirability of removing the duties might be discussed betweenthe United States and the exporting countries.Palm oils and coconut oils processed in the United States are subject to a pro-cessing tax of 3 cents per lb. and 5 cents per lb. respectively. This tax is in effect a tariff which discourages imports from the Sterling Area and other countries of thefree world.Among fuels, crude petroleum and certain petroleum products are subjected to import duties varying from 10\ cents per barrel for heavy crude to 84 cents perbarrel for lubricating oil. These &quot;duties reduce the net dollar receipts of foreign oil companies, and among these the British oil companies. The amount of such reduction is approximately 3 million dollars a year for the British-controlled companies alone.
Tariff Rates on Manufactured Goods25. Among sterling area countries the United Kingdom is the principalexporter of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods to the United States.Annex IV lists 20 major groups of commodities which accounted for about 56 percent, of total United Kingdom exports to the United States in 1952. Ten of these groups, accounting for more than one-third of United Kingdom exports to theUnited States, were subject to whole or in part to import duties amounting to 20 percent, ad valorem (or its equivalent) or higher. Moreover, the ultimate effect on the selling price of consumer goods (which bulk largely in United Kingdom exportsto United States) is intensified through normal commercial processes. Suchimported goods bear a high mark-up with the result that at the retail selling point the effect of the tariff can be approximately twice as great as at the point ofincidence. The current level at which these goods in Annex IV are being exported to the United States shows that there is a demand for them. It can ^&quot;hardly be doubted therefore that the improvement in their competitive, position relative to united States domestic products, resulting from a decrease in the tariff rates, would lead to substantially increased dollar earnings for the United Kingdom.The need to reduce high rates of tariff and the possible effect of such reduction on the dollar earnings of the free world outside the United States are clear enough.It would, however, in the view of the United Kingdom be a mistake to ignore the contribution which could be made by further reduction or elimination of tariffswhich are relatively low. As competition in the United States market becomesmore keen and margins are reduced, even a low tariff imposes a handicap whichcould be a decisive factor in the expansion or even the maintenance of dollar earn-ings. Moreover, as explained above, the effect of the tariff is greatly increased inthe case of consumer goods through the commercial mark-up system. In addition,the tariff, even when low, bears hardly on certain types of industry in which theUnited Kingdom is deeply interested. These are industries producing new goods,industries who are newcomers to the export field, and industries in one or bothof these categories for whose goods there is appearing a new or rapidly expandingdemand. Such industries account for a significant and growing part of the exportsof the United Kingdom. Examples in the first group are the electronics, plastics andsynthetic fibre industries. Aircraft (tariff 15 per cent.) provide an example in boththe second and third of these categories, where the tariff, although not high, maysoon interfere with exports. The price factor is often an important element in thedevelopment of these industries and the increased selling price resulting from thetariff, even when this is relatively small, has a significant effect on production and export.The policies followed by the United Kingdom Government have been designedto make the internal economy of the United Kingdom more flexible, to curb home demand and to free additional resources for export. In consequence some UnitedKingdom industries have now spare capacity. Some export markets for the pro-ducts of these industries have been reduced or closed because the customer countrysimply cannot afford the imports. This makes it all the more important that countries, which like the United States have a surplus on their balance of payments,should not artificially impede the entry and sale of these goods. Governments indebtor countries will be helped to persevere in internal measures to free resources for export, if their exports are then freely and fairly admitted at least by countrieswhich can, on balance of payments grounds, weir afford to do so. Annex V gives a list to illustrate the range of United Kingdom industries which could produce more for export and whose dollar-earning and general competitive power could beraised, if they were given the opportunity to compete without impediment in theUnited States market.Section VI. Other Laws and Procedures which might be adjusted to IncreaseDollar-Earning Opportunities26. The other major impediments to exports to the United States may besummarised under the following main heads: -&apos;      (i) The limitations of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.(ii) Classification and valuation of goods for duty.1     (iii) The &quot; Buy American &quot; Act and related legislation.(iv) The Defence Production Act. v .:r : (v) United States shipping policies. 1 .
It must be emphasised that action is desirable under all these heads. Minorisolated improvements would not be enough. Far-reaching changes over a wide field are needed not only to provide opportunities for trade on the scale requiredbut also to give exporters confidence in the continuing possibilities of the UnitedStates market.27. The United Kingdom Government recognize that some of the limitations on dollar-earning opportunities arise out of defence considerations. Where,however, it is suggested that United States protective measures should be taken ormaintained on defence or other grounds, it seems essential that the case shouldbe strenuously examined to ensure that these measures will not do net damage tothe defence of the free world as a whole.For example some of the principal dollar-earning commodities of the sterling area, e.g., rubber and tin, are produced in strategically important territories whereCommunism is an actual or potential menace. These territories are generallyunderdeveloped and their economies, which are heavily dependent on one or twoproducts, cannot withstand shocks. It is in the interests of United States and otherindustrialised countries of the free world to frame their policies towards com-modities like rubber and tin with due regard for economic stability in the producingterritories so as to strengthen their ability to resist Communist infection.Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act28. This Act is of paramount importance and significance since it governscurrent United States tariff policy in all major respects. The United KingdomGovernment were glad to learn from the President^ recent message to Congressthat the United States Administration would wish to see the Act renewed in itspresent form for a year only, and merely as a holding measure. They would hopethat no amendments of a restrictve nature would be introduced into the Act at this time as these would be most disturbing to exporting countries and would be inter-preted by them as a bad augury for the future. The Act, as it stands, strictly limits the ability of the United States Government to reduce the United States tariff either in breadth or depth. It precludes improvement in the following five important aspects:  (a) The Act requires reciprocity, that is equivalent concessions from othercountries in return for reductions in the United States tariff. Thus itprevents the United States Administration from making the unilateralconcessions which are appropriate in view of the strength and creditorposition of the United States economy and which are necessary to helpremove the unbalance between United States and the rest of the free world. ;(b) Moreover, the Act absolutely prohibits a reduction of tariffs below 50 percent, of their 1945 level.(c) Even within the limits of (b) the Administration is obliged to justify to congress any tariff concession below a &quot; peril point,&quot; which has been previously fixed by the Tariff Commission.(d) The &quot; escape &quot; provisions of the Act enable tariffs which have been reducedto be raised again in certain circumstances against an increase in imports. These provisions, which have been frequently invoked in thelast two years in the face of an increase in the sales of certain imported goods, perhaps do more than any other single manifestation of &quot; pro-tectionist &quot; policy to undermine the confidence of exporters in the long-term prospects of the United States market.(e) Finally, the uncertainty caused by the need to renew the Act at frequent... intervals is in itself most damaging to confidence and lends muchstrength to the belief of exporters that the United States import policyis based on shoft-term considerations and is periodically susceptible topressures inimical to imports.In connection with the &quot; escape clause &quot; referred to at id) above it is sometimessuggested that since only one out of some twenty-five applications, have actuallyresulted in increased duties, the harmful effects of these provisions have beenexaggerated. This argument overlooks the fact that the uncertainty engenderedby applications, irrespective of the eventual decision, does grave harm to exportefforts. The more vigorous and successful the efforts of exporters, the greater is the
likelihood that the United States domestic industry affected will make an applica-tion. Decisions can take up to a year to emerge and during the whole of that timethe exporters concerned are naturally loath to extend their activities in the marketlest their efforts should be frustrated by an adverse decision. Moreover there is nothing to prevent a domestic industry, which has failed in its first application,from putting forward another. One industry has in fact filed a second application and lately rumours have been rife that others intend to do the same. Clearly this situation is highly prejudicial to sustained efforts on the part of exporters and con-ducive to the belief of some exporters that the United States will not tolerateeffective competition from overseas and will always seek ways in which to frustrateany increase in imports.Customs Difficulties Classification of Goods for Duty29. Apart from the height of the tariff, exporters are faced with related diffi-culties on the classification and valuation of goods for duty purposes. Classificationproblems arise particularly on new products, since the Tariff Act of 1930 has notbeen revised to keep up with the numerous technological developments of the lasttwenty years. Some countries in the free world outside the United States areexpending considerable effort in producing these new goods from which they would hope to obtain a valuable increase in their dollar earnings.The problem of classification in relation to new products is of special import-ance to United Kingdom exporters. Since there is no adequate classification forthese goods, they are classified in the first instance either by similitude withestablished products and charged accordingly or are charged under a general para-graph carrying a high rate of duty. Thus, the first United States imports of radarfrom the United Kingdom were classified as clockwork mechanisms carrying a duty of 65 per cent.: it took three years to obtain reclassification as electricalapparatus carrying a duty of 15 per cent. In the case of nylon, earlier imports wereclassified by similitude with products made of other materials, but a recent CustomsCourt decision has now completely reversed this procedure, and nylon prodiictsare now classified as a synthetic textile, with consequential widespread changes inthe tariff rates applicable. Again, appropriate classifications for motor-cyclespeedometers and a special type of linoleum have so far taken two years and four-and-a-half years respectively for determination. As for plastics, it is fair to saythat exporters do not really know where they stand at all. The considerable lossof time often involved in obtaining a reasonable tariff classification, and the uncertainty of the position preclude that vigorous exploitation of market oppor-t unities which is particularly essential in the building up of a successful export tradein new and developing lines. As long as the tariff continues, the only satisfactory way of dealing With this difficulty is to provide, in new legislation, appropriatedefinitions of all these new products with reasonable and appropriate rates of duty.Valuation of Goods for Duty30. Valuation difficulties also are bound to Occur where there are, as now,four possible alternative bases of valuation; moreover, a fifth basis is used for coal-tar chemicals and dyes which raises the duty payable on these products byas much as 200 per cent, to 300 per cent, of the original value. United kingdom exports of these products to the United States could in view of their strong com-petitive advantage provide a substantial increase in the dollar earnings of theUnited Kingdom, if it were not for these duties which have completely stultifiedthis trade.Conclusion on Classification and Valuation31. There is a widespread and deep-seated feeling among exporters that these difficulties of classification and valuation are so formidable that they amount to-and are in fact described as &quot; a second tariff.&quot; It must therefore be recordedthat the Customs Simplification Bill in its current form, on the enactment of which,or something similar, high hopes have been placed in some quarters does not dealwith the problem of classification at all; and, though it makes some improvements in valuation, it still leaves unaffected the basis of valuation for. the important group of chemicals and dyes.The obstacles and difficulties arising out of United States, tariff rates, bases of valuation, -Customs regulations and procedure stem directly from the Tariff act of 1930.   It would seem that nothing short of a re-writing of this Act, in the light
of the great change in circumstances since its enactment, could wholly and satis-factorily remove these obstacles and difficulties. The United Kingdom Govern-rrient would therefore hope that, whatever interim and alleviating action may betaken, the United States Government will consider a new Tariff Act as an ultimateand essential requirement towards which to work.&quot; Buy American &quot; Act and Related Legislationx ;; 32. The &quot;Buy American &quot; Act of 1933 means in practice that a foreign tender for a Federal contract cannot normally be accepted unless it shows a 25 per cent,price advantage over the lowest domestic bid. Many States and Municipalitieshave enacted local legislation on similar lines. Moreover, the &quot; Buy American &quot;doctrine extends beyond the Act itself, since its provisions have subsequently been applied to the use of funds made available by the Federal Housing administration and the Rural Electrification Administration&apos; The Merchant Marine Act of 1936also provides that subsidies, granted for shipbuilding and maritime operations, mustbe used wherever practicable on domestic goods, so that this discrimination extend to ships&apos; fittings and furnishings. Furthermore, the annual Appropriation Act forthe Department of Defence forbids the Armed Services (who are already bound bythe provisions of the Buy American Act) from purchasing non-perishable food orclothing which has not been produced in the United States and., moreover, suchclothing, if of wool or cotton, must in practice have been made from United Statesraw materials.The serious effects of the Act as an obstacle to imports have been more andmore evident during the last few years with the growing efforts of the rest of thefree world to increase exports to the United States. The Act has already impingedon the United Kingdom heavy electrical engineering industry, a strongly com-petitive industry which has built up a successful world-wide export trade and hasin recent years sought to earn dollars in the United States market. The whole effect,of the Act, however, is to debar foreign firms from securing contracts, even when their tenders have met all the terms required and they have put in the lowest bids.The Act is highly prejudicial to foreign suppliers and it is not only a grave deterrent to firms who might otherwise be prepared to enter this highly competitive fieldbut its existence may lead firms Who have persevered in this field to abandon the,struggle.   &quot; &apos;The early abolition or drastic amendment of the Act would be most helpful and encouraging to other countries of the free world and would be a practical demon-stration that United States policy was really directed towards increasing imports.Removal of this obstacle would create opportunities over a large field since the Actapplies to a very considerable volume of purchases of a wide range of goods,amounting in 1950 to some $15,000 million. Countries of the free world outsidethe United States have been virtually excluded from this business,- and have therefore as yet hardly explored its potentialities.Defence Production Act Section 104) 33. Section 104 of the Defence Production Act, inserted on the renewal of theAct in 1951, is expressly designed to prevent or limit imports over a wide range offats, oils and dairy products, by the exports of which many countries in Europe and.elsewhere could increase their dollar earnings. This section is particularly signifi-carit as the instrument of a policy inimical to imports since it limits them in the mostunequivocal and positive way by the imposition of quantitative restrictions basedupon purely protectionist criteria. It also gives rise to the utmost uncertainty since these criteria are based on domestic conditions in the United States which are liableto change, and the yearly renewal of the Act allows recurring opportunities forextension. . .-, &apos; . ,,. . ,.. &apos;:: j The restrictions under Section 104 of the Defence Production Act damage the dollar export performance and prospects of the primary producers of the sterling area. There has been a total embargo on imports of butter for some time, so that australia and New Zealand have been unable to take advantage of the tariff eoncesL;sion which they negotiated with the United States in 1947, They then concentrated on producing more cheese and dried milk products, for export to the United States,but these attempts to increase their dollar earnings have subsequently been thwartedby the;imposition of import quotas on certain types of cheese and by a recent total-embargo on dried milk products. Australia has been particularly affected by theimport quota on cheddar cheese, which prohibits imports; inquantities whieKffr
would be economic to export. Before these restrictions were imposed, exports ofcheese and dried milk products from Australia and New Zealand to the UnitedStates were over $3 million a year. Though the value of this trade was trivial inrelation to total United States production, its stoppage has been serious as it hasdeprived Australia and New Zealand of the opportunity to-earn dollars and to expand and diversify their export markets for these products.United States Shipping Policies . s&apos;34. United States legislation contains two different kinds of measures designedto promote United States shipping interests, firstly the reservation in whole or inpart of certain cargoes to United States flag ships and secondly the provision&apos; of subsidies related to costs of United States shipping. &quot;-:Coastal trade between the United States ports is entirely reserved for UnitedStates flag ships. As far as United States foreign trade is concerned, the MutualSecurity Act of 1950 provided that 50 per cent, of the gross tonnage of all goodsfinanced out of Mutual Security funds and shipped froth the United States mustbe carried in United States flag ships. A similar preference is frequently given inpractice in regard to cargoes financed by ExportTmport Bank loans.Under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 operating subsidies are paid to somethirteen United States shipping companies in respect of services on essential trade routes. These subsidies are designed to make up the difference between UnitedStates costs of operation and those of foreign flag competitors. , Some thirty-eightsubsidised services are at present operated on twentyrnine trade routes, embracingall the principal trading areas of the world. These subsidies in the United Statesfiscal year 1951-52 amounted to $36 million. Construction subsidies are also paid under the same Act (supplemented by the Long-Range Shipping Act, 1952) toenable United States operators to acquire vessels built in the United States foruse in foreign trade, at a price comparable to the cost of building similar vesselsabroad. .35. These cargo preferences and subsidies lead to artificial distortion of thenormal pattern of trade and have far-reaching effects on the shipping of the restof the free world. Except in abnormal periods of shipping scarcity the oppOr-tunities of other maritime countries to carry their own and other cargoes arerestricted and a larger volume of United States tonnage is kept in operation than is justified on economic and commercial grounds. As a result the dollar expenditureof other countries is unnecessarily increased, and their opportunities to earn dollarsand other foreign exchange through shipbuilding and shipping services are reduced.Moreover, United States vessels sometimes require rates in excess of the open market rate, thus adding to the freight expenditure of the countries required by united States law to use them. Recently the United Kingdom has been obliged touse United States shipping for the carriage of M.S.A.-financed goods although the freight was 100 per cent, above the market rate. Other countries with shippingaspirations are encouraged to follow the example Of the United States and to quotethe United States practice in justification of their own discriminatory measures.This indirect consequence of United States shipping policies is at the present oneof the most serious for other maritime countries whose policies, like those of theUnited Kingdom, are designed to secure the unrestricted circulation of all shipping in free and fair competition throughout the free world.Shipping Policies. Conclusion36. In the sector of United States shipping policies there is, in the view of theUnited Kingdom Government, considerable scope for increasing the ability of othercountries of the free world to earn their own living competitively by their own efforts.The United Kingdom and the rest of the Sterling Area are particularly concerned to obtain ampler opportunities for earning dollars from shipping. The British stake in this matter will be readily realised from the fact that nearly 30 per cent, of thenon-United States merchant tonnage of. the world is British. The United KingdomGovernment suggest that the time has come when the United States Governmentshould examine its shipping policies in all their aspects, perhaps in consultation withthe N.A.T.O., with a view to making adjustments which will increase the dollar-earning opportunities of the rest of the free world while respecting the requirementsof the defence of the United States and the free world as a whole.
Section VII. Conclusion37. The areas, where greater opportunities for exporting to the United states would be helpful, have been indicated generally in the preceding Sections of thismemorandum. The examples quoted there are illustrative and are drawn mainly from the export experience of the United Kingdom. But the obstacles to importspresented by the tariff and other laws and procedures affect imports from all partsof the world and all countries producing such goods, and the United KingdomGovernment believe that all exporting countries would endorse the arguments putforward in the memorandum. The United Kingdom itself has a highly diversifiedindustrial output and the range of exports from the rest of the free world to theUnited States is enormous. Governments cannot accurately predict the results ofremoval of specific obstacles to dollar-earning: this can be ascertained only byexporters themselves and from experience. The continuation of any impedimentsmay cut out valuable opportunities for dollar earning. There would therefore be clear advantage in making relaxations over the widest possible field in order thatexporters may discover what lines of production are particularly suitable for theUnited States market. This would have the further advantage that the impact ofthe additional imports on United States domestic production would be widelydiffused.38. The task of re-creating a free international economic system through which the peoples of the free world can earn their living by then industry, tradeand commerce can be accomplished. There are obvious difficulties, but nonewhich energetic apd enlightened action, by creditor as well as debtor, countries,cannot overcome. As the United States Government recognize, the commandingposition of the United States in the world economy carries with it special opportunities -ties and responsibilities. The United Kingdom Government hope that the UnitedStates Government will seek to create those general and specific conditions inside the United States, which are indicated in this memorandum, and which will help to maintain balance between the United States and the rest of the free world onthe basis of &quot; trade not aid.&quot; In the trade field the United States will have playedits part if it creates fair opportunities for others to earn dollars in an expandingUnited States market. It will then be for the exporters in the rest of the free world to find out where the expanded opportunities lie and to make the most of them.

In 1952 United States military expenditures overseas were running at a rate alittle below $2,000 million per annum as against an average annual expenditure a little above $500million per annum in the period immediately preceding the Korean war. Provision should thereforebe made against a possible decline of, say, $1,500 million in these expenditures at some future date.(b) Restrictions on imports into the United States The main other abnormal feature of the 1952 results is that they were obtained throughrestrictions on imports from United States. It is not possible to offer a reasoned forecast of the increasein United States exports if restrictions were reduced, but it is unlikely to be less than $1,000 million.In this figure would be included some allowance for the natural increase in United States exports.(c) Estimate of prospective dollar gapThus, the total gap to be filled with non-aid measures over the next three or four years wouldbuild up to about $4,500 million per annum, arrived at as follows: $ millionCurrent surplus as in 1952     ..................      2,000Possible decline in military expenditure overseas   .........      1,500Reduction of restrictions in imports from United States   ......      1,000Total    ............      ...      4,500(d) Assumptions underlying the above estimateThis calculation is clearly subject to a substantial margin of error. In the first place it is necessarilybased on the working assumption that the prices of United States imports would remain comparativelystable, both absolutely and in relation to the prices of United States exports. Moreover, it is alsoassumed that the United States will maintain a high level of business activity and a stable but expandingeconomy, as indicated in paragraph 4 of the memorandum, and that the rest of the free world willsuccessfully contain inflation and increase production and productivity. Falsification of either ofthese assumptions would totally alter the nature and size of the problem, but on these assumptionsthe United Kingdom Government suggest that the United States should aim at closing the prospectivegap, through investment and additional trade and commerce, by an amount in the region of $4,000million to $5,000 million per annum. The aim would be to achieve this over the next three or fouryears, during which the pattern of payments between the United States and the rest of the world would progressively contain more trade and less aid.ANNEX iii the following table is based on material included in a report on &quot; International Trade policy issues &quot; prepared in February 1953 for the Chamber of Commerce of the United States.
