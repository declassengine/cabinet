Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1953SECRET Copy No.    WC (53) 13823rd April, 1953CABINETMR.  NEHRU&apos;S  SPEECHNote by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations circulate for the information of my colleagues the attached record of a conversation which I had this morning, 23rd April, with the High Commissionerfor India.SWINTONCommonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,23rd April, 1953.The Indian High Commissioner came to see me this morning. He saidthat he had reported our talk to his Government and now had received their reply.I had no doubt received the full text of certain passages in Mr. Nehru&apos;s speech which had been given to our High Commissioner. I said that I had received this and that it confirmed the accuracy of the summary on which I had spoken tothe High Commissioner. I attach the text of these extracts (Annex I). I alsoattach the record of my previous conversation (Annex II).2. The High Commissioner said that the Government of India regretted thatthe speech should have made such an unfavourable impression on the Governmenthere. It had not been delivered with any malicious intent. It was a speech oftwo hours&apos; duration made by Mr. Nehru as President of the Indian national congress.3. Mr. Kher said that in the Indian Parliament and outside Mr. Nehru haddefended the Commonwealth connection against much hostile criticism.Mr. Nehru was most anxious to maintain that connection and also to have close and friendly relations with us. But it was difficult for him to maintain that position and at the same time not to express - Indian anxiety where feelings inIndia were deeply roused.4. Mr. Kher said that Mr. Nehru could not be expected to keep silence on south Africa, on which Indian representatives had spoken strongly at U.N.O.while the United Kingdom stood aside. Mr. Nehru&apos;s view was that the only hopein Africa lay in a multi-racial policy.5. I replied that I had made it clear in our previous conversation that I had nothing to say about South Africa. My criticism had been directed to what mr. Nehru had said about Federation in Central Africa, which bore no sort ofrelation to South African policy and was in fact the application of a multi-racialpolicy which Mr. Nehru himself advocated. As regards our attitude at U.N.O.,Mr. Kher knew we had always maintained that U.N.O. could not concern itself with the internal affairs of any country. We should take exactly the same line if some country sought to indict India at U.N.O. on a matter of domestic policy.44101b
6. My criticism had been entirely confined to what Mr. Nehru had said about Central African Federation and about Kenya. Mr. Kher interjected thatMr. Malcolm Macdonald had made a speech in which he had characterised&quot; Colonialism &quot; in much the same terms as Mr. Nehru.7. Mr. Kher then said that Nehru&apos;s present position was made more difficult bystatements made by British officers serving in the Pakistan Army. I said that if mr. Kher would give me particulars of what British officers were alleged to have said, I would go into the matter. I was not in favour of serving officers engaging in political controversy anywhere. I had no knowledge of the facts. But surelyeven if some officer had made an unfortunate statement about Pakistan and india that was no reason why Mr. Nehru should make a public attack on British policyin Central Africa and Kenya.8. Mr. Kher said he and the Government of India felt it was important that commonwealth Governments should be frank with one another. I replied thatI could not agree more: and we would always welcome the fullest and frankestdiscussion. But that should be Government to Government and not by speeches.We had not replied to Mr. Nehru publicly but by my frank talk with the HighCommissioner.   I hoped that speeches could be avoided.9. Finally, Mr. Kher said that Mr. Nehru was coming over for the Coronationand there would be the opportunity of full talks between him and the UnitedKingdom Ministers. I said that was the way my colleagues and I would wish tohave it.10. After our conversation to-day I am convinced that Mr. Kher reportedfairly what I said to him on the previous occasion and left the Government ofIndia in no doubt as to the deplorable impression Mr. Nehru&apos;s speech had made upon the Government here. The reaction of the Indian Government, as reported by Mr. Kher, was better than I had expected. I am sure we were well advised totake the matter up promptly and fairly.ANNEX 1TELEGRAM DATED 20th APRIL FROM THE UNITED kingdom high COMMISSIONER IN INDIA(No. 86.   Saving)My telegram No. 461: Mr. Nehru&apos;s Speech.Following is full text:  On the other hand look at Africa and what is happening there. South africa is shortly going to have an election. I am not concerned with the results of theelection. But we have a long relationship with South Africa. The treatment giventhere to Indians-perhaps Indians is not the right word for these settlers, becauselegally they are now citizens of that country, but they had gone from India one ortwo or three generations ago, so even if we have no legal rights we have everyright to take interest in their welfare. For one thing, when they went, there hadbeen certain agreements in consultation with the then Government of India.Secondly, injustice and oppression based on the colour of a man&apos;s skin is completelywrong and unjustifiable. The United Nations Charter guarantees equal rights and treatment to all. Now it is well known and beyond doubt that the Governmentin South Africa wishes to give the Indians and the people of Africa a status whichis less than human and wants to segregate them in all walks of life separaterailways, separate buses, segregated houses, &amp;c. The Government wants to debarthem from entry into White settlements. This is an astonishing attitude to take in the modern world, and we have raised our voice in protest. The first protestwas by Indians settled there, but, as matters developed, the Africans, who are theoriginal and real masters of their land and therefore have the greatest rights init, also raised their voice. They have been cruelly oppressed. It is a matter of surprise and satisfaction that in South Africa the Africans have joined hands withthe majority of Indians for a Satyagraha more or less on the same lines as was
done forty years ago under Gandhi&apos;s guidance.  They have conducted the move-ment very peacefully.  Indeed it causes some surprise how they have been able tomaintain the peace under such conditions.   However, the problem in Africa is avery large problem.   I draw your attention to it not for your sympathy, whichshould flow automatically, but because the problem in Africa is fundamental toall the world.  For if this problem is not solved, the world will face a new kindof war a war based on colour in which the black will fight the white and thewhite the black.   This is a most dangerous kind of war, more dangerous thancivil war.  Africa is not a country.  It is a continent comprising many countries;it is a vast region, though the population may not be very great considering thearea.   If &quot;conditions deteriorate there as rapidly as they appear to be doing, a world danger will develop.  In the north-western corner of Africa I do not knowif you are all familiar with the map of Africa there are three small countries. TheGold Coast and Nigeria are under British rule.   There has been some progressthere undoubtedly, under the last Labour Government.  They have not got self-government, but have taken a few steps in that direction.  This was a good thingand if all Africa had moved along those lines, we might have hoped that the problem would ultimately be solved it might have taken ten years or fifteen.   But let us look at what is actually happening there now.  I have already told you whatis happening in South Africa.  In Central Africa, a Federation is being formed.Federating separate provinces is not intrinsically bad, but here the object of federation is to concentrate power in the hands of the few Europeans settled there and to give no rights to the Africans. This is the evil thing called &quot; Colonialism.&quot;India was a colony once, the British and the Germans have had other colonies.The worst feature of this Federation is that it will concentrate power in the handsof the Whites there and free them from such restraint as the British parliament might have exercised. This is similar to the state of affairs in South Africa.  SouthAfrica is an independent country.   What the Government is doing there could perhaps not have happened in any colony because in a colony there are certainrestraints.  In the Central African Federation now being formed, the British andGerman settlers who have established themselves there and taken possession ofthe land from it real owners will get all the power and there will be no one leftto protect the interests of the African population.  The decisions taken there and being taken are against the wishes of the local population, which has not even been consulted.  This is a grievous wrong.Now let us look at East Africa, especially Kenya and what is happening there.The conditions there are painful and there is horrible violence. Kenya is abeautiful country, one of the beauty spots of the world. The land is fertileespecially in the highlands. This attracted White settlers, the British and otherEuropeans. Many retired British officials from India went there to settle because in the early days land there could be obtained almost free. The real owners, the african tribes, had merely to be driven off their land and the land taken possessionof. You would be surprised to learn how much land was thus forcibly seized.There are some settlers who possess as much as fifty or a hundred thousand acresapiece. Land was thus cheaply obtained and being productive gave excellentreturns without much labour. There are farms with an income of five to fifteenlakhs of rupees per year. The dispossessed Africans were herded into what are called reserves and were sometimes employed as labour on the very lands whichwere theirs by right. Large tracts have been kept in reserve for future Europeansettlers. The five million local population is kept backward and uneducated.Gradually there has been awakening amongst them and they have made efforts to.educate themselves. They have starved to put together funds to set up their ownschools. They have built the schools with their own hands with little or no help from the Government. Naturally with the spread of education, there was dis^-content about the land. The Africans wanted their own lands and other rightsincluding the right of representation. This led to trouble. I cannot say who took theinitiative. One side says that some of the Africans set up a secret society called the Mau Mau which decided upon wholesale murder of the Whites and their supporters. It is possible that this may have happened, I do not know. SomeWhite settlers were killed. But the vengeance is out of all proportion. The guiltymust be punished, but vengeance was wreaked on millions. Many were driven outof their homes and into the jungles. It is clear that such injustice and evil practice on either side cannot solve the problem of Africa whether today or in the future.Millions cannot thus be suppressed and the problem increases in intensity. That is why I said earlier the problem of Africa is a world problem.   Obviously our44101
sympathies are with the people of Africa. Indeed we have told the Indians there,millions of Indians, traders and professional men, that we do not want any Indianliving in Africa to live there against the wishes of the Africans or to do any harm to their interests, or to exploit them. If the Africans do not Want the Indians there,we are not going to send forces to suppress the Africans. We do not want tomaintain ourselves there by force. We want to live there with goodwill. We want to help them and we can help them in thousands of ways, in education and in organisation. Indians should feel free to carry on their activities, but they should never forget that they are there as guests and that the land belongs to the Africans.In the field of education we have given some scholarships and fifty or sixty orseventy African young men have been selected for studies in India. Some are inDelhi. Others are spread over Lucknow, Benares, Madras, Bombay. They areequipping themselves for the service of their own country. The whole problem isvast, I have only drawn your attention to some of its aspects so that you can watch the developments from time to time and not be cut off from it altogether.ANNEX IITELEGRAM DATED 17th APRIL. FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS TO THE UNITED kingdom high COMMISSIONER IN INDIANo. 598Your telegram No. 448:  Mr. Nehru&apos;s SpeechI asked the Indian High Commissioner to see me to-day. I told him that i must speak to him at once about the speech Mr. Nehru delivered at Amritsar onthe anniversary of the Amritsar shooting of 1919.Mr. Nehru was reported.in the Hindustan Times as saying that the Africanpeople whether in Kenya, Central Africa or South Africa, were being persecutedand denied fundamental human rights: that in Kenya there was wholesale oppres-sion of the African people, while a handful of White settlers had usurped all theland. As regards Central African Federation, Nehru was reported as referring to it as a Federation of British and German colonists, v/ho alone would enjoyrights and privileges, while African people would be denied all rights. Indiansympathies were entirely with Africans in their struggle against exploitation,repression and colonialism.Sir Alexander Clutterbuck had already spoken to Sir Raghavan Pillai, pointing out that language of this kind was bound to do great harm both in India and Africa,and was all the more shocking in that it showed that the Prime Minister was apparently ready to believe the worst of us without verification of the facts. the speech would cause a most deplorable impression in London, and the PrimeMinister should know of this at once. Surely if Mr. Nehru had criticism to make,it was up to him to let the United Kingdom Government know of his criticismsbefore attacking their policy and motives in public.I wished fully to endorse all that Sir Alexander Clutterbuck had said, and i thought the matter was so serious that I must also speak to Mr. Kher and ask him to convey to Mr. Nehru what I said to him.First of all as regards the facts. The campaign of terrorism and murder whichwas being waged by the Mau Mau in Kenya had been universally condemned.This was not an attack on Europeans only: large numbers of African men,women and children had been murdered. The latest figures I had seen were 250Africans and eight Europeans. There had also been murders of Indians. indians in Kenya had condemned these outrages as strongly as anyone in the LegislativeAssembly; Mr. Patel, the Indian member of the Executive Council, was co-operating in every way with the Governor; and Indians had enrolled in the home guard, in the Police, and in the Police Reserve. Mr. Nehru&apos;s speech must havethe worst possible effect, and it appeared to me inconceivable that he could makeit in the circumstances.So fair as African Federation was concerned, the speech was a travesty ofthe Federation Scheme which had just been approved in Parliament, and in whichthe rights and interests of Africans were most fully safeguarded.
But I could not understand how Mr. Nehru could make a speech of this kind.Not only was it wholly unwarranted by the facts and wholly misleading, but noone had been more insistent than Mr. Nehru himself that we should not interferewith each other&apos;s affairs. I was reading a speech made by Mr. Nehru in a foreignpolicy debate in the Indian Parliament in June last year, in which Mr. Nehru said &quot; I do not want this Commonwealth to be an interfering Commonwealth ....If I admitted the right of the Commonwealth to interfere with any country in theCommonwealth, then I cease to be in the Commonwealth at all. I am not preparedfor their saying anything to me and I am not prepared to accept anything from them at all.&quot;Not only was a speech of this kind completely at variance with Mr. Nehru&apos;sdeclared policy, and the relations which he said should subsist between us; but what would he think if the Prime Minister or I made a public speech on IndianIndependence Day, attacking violently Mr. Nehru&apos;s policy with regard to large sections of the Indian population in India? He would rightly express the deepestresentment; and he must see that his speech would arouse, as it had, equally deepresentment in this country.I was bound to speak at once to Mr. Kher in the way I had, and I asked himto report what I had said to his Prime Minister; and Mr. Kher would no doubtreport to me next week when he had heard from Mr. Nehru.Mr. Kher said he would communicate at once what I had said to the PrimeMinister. He would also wish to obtain confirmation or a fuller report of the speech from India. He said that he felt sure Mr. Nehru could not have intendedtb advocate violence. I replied that I was not accusing Mr. Nehru of that intention,but that the only result of his speech must be to encourage those who wereperpetrating violence in Kenya.
