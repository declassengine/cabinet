F.Home Office, S.W.1.16TH MARCH, 1953.I will, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House,make a statement about the East Coast floods.First, I should like to say a word about the high tides of lastweek-end./jTo be inserted/2.        The Government were pleased to be able to announce that lord Waverley had accepted the ChairmanshiiD of the DepartmentalCommittee which is being set up to review the lessons of the recentdisaster and to make recommendations for the future,    I hope to be ableto announce the names of the other members of the Committee in the very near future.3.        I now turn to the question of compensation for damage and lossescaused by the recent floods.    Perhaps I may briefly recapitulate the stepsalready taken.    The first task was the immediate repair of the breaches inour sea defences.    This was tackled straight away by the River Boards, whowere given an assurance from the start that they would be reimbursed thefull cost of their operations.    Total expenditure on these first aid repairsis likely to be about  2^- millions.
4,        It was also necessary to look after those who had been renderedhomeless.    .Rest Centres were set up, emergency feeding arrangements were put in hand, lodging payments were authorised for householders whowere willing to accommodate victims of the floods, and the national assistance Board made payments in cash to those in need.    All this expenditure, which will be of the order of S.\ &quot;  -  million, will be borne on the Votes of the Departments concerned.    The Government will alsopay for first-aid repairs to damaged private houses, including the removalof mud and sand.5.        Certain longer-term measures are also required.Restoration of the sea defences6.        We have to restore and strengthen our sea defences, and to finishthe task so far as possible before the next winter.    The R.iver Boardsmainly concerned have been told that the cost of re-building the defencesto provide the same standard of protection as before will be borne entirely by the Government for all works carried out by the end of September next;and that where an improved standard of protection is necessary the rate of.grant will be a matter for negotiation - in some cases, for example, wherespecial protection is provided for an industrial installation it would be reasonable to expect the undertaking concerned to make a contribution.A Bill will shortly be introduced strengthening the powers of River Boardsto enter on lands and do works to restore our sea defences.    Such works will relate not only to the repair of existing sea walls and the building ofnew ones, but also to the quarrying of material required for that work andthe construction of access roads.    The Bill will provide for the compulsory acquisition of land on which work is done should this prove desirable.Between now and the end of September work costing between  8 and 10 millions may be done and further work will be necessary thereafter.Rehabilitation of the land7.        The Government recognise that the floods have created somedifficult problems connected with the rehabilitation of agricultural land,for which special provision will have to be made, particularly in view oftheir long-term nature.    As a nation, we cannot afford to lose for manyyears and possibly for ever the productivity of thousands of acres of farmland.8,        The free supply of gypsum, where it is needed, and the removal atthe Governments expense of flood-borne debris from drains and ditches,have already been announced.    In addition to these measures, the Govern-ment propose to make acreage payments to farmers whose land was so badlyaffected by sea water flooding as to require special treatment before normalcropping or grazing can be undertaken without serious risk of making the damage worse.    The farmers will be expected to conform to an approvedprogramme of restoration.9.        These payments will vary according to the kind of treatmentrequired and to the risk of reduced yields and may extend if necessary overa period of five years.    /^Expenditure on crops sown prior to the floodswill be taken into account in fixing the rates of payment^7
10.        2l Orchards that have been destroyed will be dealt with on rather different lines, but with the same general object in view./   The existing arrangements for Exchequer grants tov/ards the cost of cleaning out drainsand ditches in the flooded areas will in principle be extended at a higher rate to work not directly arising out of the floods in order to assist the free flow of water and so get rid of the salt more quickly.    /The reasonable cost offences to replace destroyed hedges and of repairs to fences will be borneby the Government^/   Finally, where it is practicable, the Government will assume responsibility for removing large accumulations of sand and debrisfrom farm land.11.        The total cost of all these measures for the rehabilitation of theland is roughly estimated at between  5 -  7 millions.Local authorities1Z.       Many local authorities have suffered damage and losses and areincurring expenditure on a substantial scale.    It will not be possible to dealwith each claim individually, and at a later date there will have to be ageneral settlement between the Government and the local authorities whichare in a position of special difficulty through having to incur expenditure onrepairing flood damage.    In that settlement the Government will be preparedto assist those authorities which have unavoidably incurred burdens whichare unreasonably heavy in relation to their resources./J.3.    There is, however, one local authority service for which theGovernment undertake to give full reimbursement without regard either tothe total burden on the authority or to its resources.    All necessaryexpenditure by local authorities on the restoration of coast protection works to their pre-flood condition will be reimbursed in full, in the same way as theRiver Boards will be reimbursed for the cost of restoring the sea defences.Expenditure may also be necessary for the new protective works at pointswhere the heavy seas of 31st January found gaps in the existing defences and showed the need for further protection against erosion.    In thesecases approved expenditure will rank for normal grants under the CoastProtection Act, 1949, each case being considered on its merits.// Alternative paragraph 1313.       Meanwhile, in view of the magnitude of the disaster, the Governmentwill reimburse in full to any local authority the cost of restoring coastprotection works to the condition they were in before the floods.    If new works have to be undertaken, as in some areas they will, they will rank for grant under the Coast Protection Act in the usual way.    Where the expenditureon new works is heavy and the authority&apos;s resources are small, the Govern&quot;ment will be prepared to consider a higher rate of grant than is normal.The question when it will be possible to authorise works will have to beconsidered on each scheme in relation to the resources available.    TheGovernment will also be prepared to reimburse in full to any local authority the cost of restoring essential public services, such as water supply,sewage disposal works, roads, to the condition in which they were before being damaged by the floods^/Compensation to individuals and businesses14.       Hon. Members will have seen in yescerday&apos;s &quot;Times&quot; a letter fromthe Lord Mayor setting out in detail the uses to which his Fund will be put.The guiding principle is the relief of personal distress, but grants willalso be made in respect of damage to, or loss of, the stock-in-trade or
premises of a personal business or small partnership within a normal limit of  5,000.    The Lord Mayor stated that he will authorise a grant above this figure on evidence that unusual and immediate hardship and distress wouldresult if the grant were limited to  5,000, although he said that his present information was that such cases could be numbered on the fingers of bothhands.    I should like to make clear where the Government stand in thismatter of compensation to business concerns.    In our view public limited liability companies fall into a different category both from individuals and small businesses, and should not be compensated for losses which theycould have covered by   insurance.    If they did not insure, they were taking a calculated commercial risk and they must bear responsibility for their decision.    I am sure that the House will agree that it would not be rightto expect the taxpayer or the ratepayer to subsidise &quot;big business&quot; which iswell able to look after itself,15.       There may, however, be cases which fall between the small personalbusiness which can look to the Lord Mayor -s Fund for assistance and thelarge public company which cannot.    For example, there might be a business in form a public company, which carried on operations on a small scale andmight be in a position of difficulty as the result of the floods.    If there isa case of a small business where personal or family hardship is involved,either to the proprietors or the workpeople, the Government undertake to look at it to see what can be done,16.       The House will wish rne to express on its behalf our greatappreciation of the generosity of the public in having contributed on such a scale to the Lord Mayor!s Fund, and also to express our thanks to theLord Mayor himself and his staff for the energy, skill and speed with whichhe set up the Fund and is now administering it.The Government recognise that the loss and suffering caused by adisaster of this kind cannot be completely recompensed by financial paymentsbut the decisions which I have outlined today for the provision of assistancefrom public funds, and the arrangements by the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund, to whichincidentally the Exchequer is making a contribution on the basis of poundfor pound, will go a very long way towards mitigating the losses which so many of our fellow citizens have had to endure.
