(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential&apos;(53) 106 COPY NO.  IP18TK MARCH, 1953CABINETAMNESTY FOR DESERTERS:  MISTAKEN CLAIMSMemorandum by the Minister of defence position of some difficulty has arisen over the treatment of men who haveclaimed the benefits of the amnesty for deserters in the mistaken belief that their cases fall within the limiting dates (3rd September, 1939 to 15th August, 1945, both inclusive) announced by the Prime Minister in his statement to the House ofCommons on 23rd February.2.       There are at present about 300 of these men, out of over 1,500 who have sofar claimed the benefit of the amnesty.    A large proportion of the applicants live in Eire.    The erroneous claims vary from desertion a few days after VJ Day to recent desertions from the Forces.    Two men who made erroneous claims were arrested before instructions were sent out to take no action on these cases pendingconsideration by Ministers:  one has since been released, as his case was considered,to fall broadly within the terms of the amnesty.    Details are set out in the Annex.3.       There is little doubt that many of the men who have made these erroneousclaims have only heard in general terms of the amnesty as one for men who servedduring the v/ar, and it may be difficult politically to subject them to the ordinarysystem of trial by court martial, in the same way as a deserter who surrenders oris apprehended by the Police in the ordinary way.4.       I have considered this question with the Service Ministers.    There seem,broadly speaking, only three ways of treating these men:-(1)   To try them by court martial, but on review to mitigate the sentence.of the court where this is thought desirable - which the reviewingService authorities have power to do.    But this would meanarresting the men concerned, and removing them from their civil employment for possibly a matter of weeks while the court martial procedure is followed.    Further, in the Navy many ofthese cases are tried summarily by Commanding Officers.No protection certificate would be necessary if the men were tried by court martial or summarily.    On release, men would beput to the appropriate reserve.(2)   To ignore these erroneous claims.    In practice, some limitwould appear necessary to this &quot;blind eye&quot; procedure and areasonable limiting date might be 31st December, 1946, whenthe system of wartime call-up gave place to one of call-up for short fixed periods.    But this course amounts to condoning the offence; the men would have no protection certificate, and itwould not be easy to explain the Governments policy when -as would be inevitable - we should be forced to state what wewere doing with these men.    There is moreover the problemof how, under this procedure, we would deal with a man whowrote in, but who had deserted within the last five years or so,
(3)    To inform any Army and Air Force deserters affectedthat they do not come under the amnesty, but thattheir position can be regularised if they sign aconfession of desertion in the prescribed form, whentrial by court martial will be dispensed with (underSection 73 of the Army and Air Force Act) and theywill be placed at once on the Z or other appropriatereserve.    This is analogous to the procedure adoptedin 1922 in regard to duration-of-war enlistments duringthe 1914-18 war.    They would thus escape any sentenceand would merely have to go through the formality of calling at the nearest unit and signing a confession before a Commanding Officer.    They would, however, have tobe told that if they failed to do so they would be liableto be arrested and tried.    This procedure would hardly be applicable to the men who have written from Eire, butI do not think they really matter.    They could be dealtwith if and when they return to this country.    It would,however, be difficult to adhere to any limiting date, say,31st December, 1946, for this solution of the problem.The procedure of dispensing with trial is not applicableto the Royal Navy, but I understand that the admiralty could deal with the matter administratively.There are, of course, a number of variants possible in the shape ofcombinations of (1), (2) and (3).5. The Service Ministers and I do not find it easy to recommend oneof these courses to the Cabinet in preference to another.    We agree that thestraightforward course, which would avoid creating further anomalies and  &apos;adhere to the requirements of military law, would be to admit no exceptions to the announced dates of the amnesty, and therefore to arrest and try by court martial or summarily all those men who have applied in error for thebenefits of the amnesty.    There seems little doubt however from the natureof Press comment hitherto, that this course might be regarded by publicopinion as taking undue advantage of men who made a mistake in good faith,based on faulty or incomplete versions of the amnesty announcement whichthey may have heard.    These effects might be reduced by following course (3)of paragraph 4.6. In view of the political implications of this problem we have thoughtit best to ask for it to be considered by the Cabinet.A.Ministry of Defence, S.W.I.18TK MARCH, 1953.
