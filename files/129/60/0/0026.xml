Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1953.CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    6C. (53) 12716th April, 1953CABINETREGIONAL organisation memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer should like to discuss with my colleagues the ways in which, without serious loss of efficiency, a reduction might be made in the number and size of regional offices of Government Departments throughout the country. There are about 25,000non-industrial civil servants in these regional offices.The Closing of Regional Offices2. In pre-war days there were fewer and larger regions and the staffs in regional offices totalled about 4,000. During the war there were 12 civil defenceregions and the numbers employed were very large. With the gradual disappear -ance of the abnormal conditions created by the war and the emergence of the post-war pattern of Government organisation, a major question for decision is whether we should assume the continuance in peace of the 12 regional headquarters created for war purposes (or 11 if as is generally agreed regional offices in TunbridgeWells are unnecessary in peace-time) or whether a smaller number of regions wouidsuffice.3. A substantial measure of regional devolution would remain if all the regional offices in Tunbridge Wells, Cambridge, Reading and Newcastle were closed down. In fact, the resultant pattern of regional organisation would correspondclosely to that which the Post Office has used since the &apos;30s. The Post Office isregarded as a department that practises substantial regional devolution and has alarger local organisation to control than any other Government Department.4. The closing of regional offices in some or all of the towns indicated andthe transfer of the work to neighbouring regional towns would save an appreciableproportion of the staff affected. The shutting down of the regional offices at Cam-bridge would save 250 staff (23 per cent, of the staff in post), at Reading 160 (16 percent.), and at Newcastle 230 (19 per cent.). Undoubtedly further savings would beachieved, since these figures represent cautious estimates prepared by the Depart-ments concerned.5. Several Departments are opposed to the closing of the regional offices atCambridge, Reading and, particularly, Newcastle. Some fear that the move wouldbe interpreted as a reversal of the policy of administrative devolution which hasbeen practised in recent years. Others are concerned about the loss of regional andlocal contact which would result, and some of the Departments which administerlarge numbers of local offices consider that their supervision of these offices wouldbe less efficient if the present number of regions is replaced by a smaller number of much larger regions. Moreover, in so far as the closing of offices in Cambridge andReading will bring staff into London, it is argued that the higher cost of office accommodation in London and the various allowances which will have to be madeto the staff because London salaries are higher and because they will not be able tofind living accommodation easily in London, will eat away a substantial proportionof the savings likely to accrue from the reduction in the numbers of staff. More-over, it is desirable, as a war preparation, to avoid an undue concentration of Government activity in London.44063 , b
6. It is. therefore, necessary to balance the staff savings and the political advantages of having simplified the administrative machine against the admittedpractical disadvantages of reducing the number of regions. It would not be a satis-f satisfactory solution of this difficulty to close down the regional offices of some Depart-ments and not of others. One great advantage of regional administration whichwould be lost is that the necessary close contacts between Departments can be madeat the same level in the same town. There are also certain common service Depart-ments, such as the Ministry of Works and the Stationery Office, which can only make substantial reductions in their regional organisation if all other Departmentsmake corresponding reductions in theirs.7.   In this situation the matter is best examined further in relation to the separate regional headquarters towns.Tunbridge Wells (South-Eastern Region)8. Most Departments have already closed their regional offices in TunbridgeWells and have combined the South-Eastern Region with the London Region. Thetwo Departments that still have regional offices the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment and the Ministry of Fuel and Power both propose to withdraw these offices in the near future. Tunbridge Wells will then cease to be a regional head-quarters town. There is no problem here.Cambridge (Eastern Region) -9. Much of the Eastern Region is more accessible from London than fromCambridge. It is true that, if the Eastern Region is combined with the London andSouth-Eastern Regions, the resulting region will have a working population of over millions or nearly one-third of the working population of Great Britain and thatthe regional office staff in some Departments will be very large. Nevertheless, the closing of the Cambridge offices seems to be practicable and, as already mentioned,would save at least 250 staff,Reading (Southern Region)10. The Southern Region presents a less straightforward problem. It is an artificial creation and, on dissolution, part would tend to be attracted to the South-Western Region and part to the London Region. Some Departments not unnatur-ally consider that their London Region, if it is to include the Eastern Region as well,will be almost too large and that it will be unworkable if the Southern Region isadded to it. It is clear there can be no standard formula for the merging of theSouthern Region and that it must be either combined with the South-WesternRegion or divided between the London and South-Western Regions or combined with the London Region, possibly in some cases with administration from the head-quarters of the Department rather than from a regional office. The pattern of regional administration in this part of the country would, therefore, probably varyas between Departments.11. One Department which might find the merger very difficult is the Ministryof Labour, because of the large number of local offices which it controls. As an exceptional case, we might agree that the Ministry of Labour should follow the pattern already adopted by the Ministry of National Insurance and have a secondLondon regional office which would control the home counties from the Wash toSouthampton Water. Even with the creation of a second London regional office,there would be considerable staff economies.12. The fact that a number of Departments will leave small out-posts in regional headquarters towns also allows of different arrangements to meet theneeds of different Departments.Newcastle (Northern Region)13. If Newcastle ceased to be a regional headquarters town, the northern region would need to be administered, either entirely from Leeds (the East and WestRiding region) or mostly from Leeds and for the remainder (Cumberland andWestmorland) from Manchester (North-Western region). Of the proposals for (merger outlined in this memorandum, the one for the Northern region would&apos;present Departments with the greatest difficulty. The large industrial concentra-tion on Tyneside would be over 100 miles from regional headquarters at Leedsand the distance would cause a good deal of inconvenience and extra travelling.
14. In view of the general dislike among Departments of the merging ofregions, it would probably be better to leave the Newcastle operation to a later stage, when the need for the Nottingham regional offices might also be examined.Common Regional Offices15. From time to time there have been suggestions that the experimentswhich are being conducted in having local offices which served a number of departments should be matched by corresponding experiments at the regional level. At present the most promising field for experiment is the trade and industrygroup of Departments, because, with the cessation of some controls, the work atthe regional level is decreasing in amount. The matter has been examined closely in relation to the Board of Trade, Admiralty, Ministry of Supply and Ministry of fuel and Power. It was found that it would be difficult to include the Ministry of fuel and Power regional office in a common regional office, because its workdiffers substantially from that of the other three Departments. It would, however,be practicable to have a common regional office for the Board of Trade, theMinistry of Supply and possibly the Admiralty. The Board of Trade already actas agents at the regional level for the Ministry of Materials. The staff savings from an arrangement of this kind would not, at the outset, be spectacular and havebeen calculated at 10 staff per region. But it would be a useful development fromthe point of view of administrative economies and might pave the way to very substantial savings in future. It might also be found possible later on to include in the common regional offices other Departments besides those mentioned above.The position in Scotland and Wales would have to be looked at separately.Recommendations16. On the basis that the Government attach importance to a simplificationof the regional organisation and to a reduction in the numbers employed in it, my recommendations are:  (a) that we close all regional offices in Cambridge and Reading, reserving for later consideration the closing of the regional offices in Newcastle andpossibly Nottingham;(b) that in the remaining regional headquarters towns the Board of Trade andthe Ministry of Supply combine their regional offices, reserving for later consideration the inclusion of the Admiralty and possibly other Depart-ments in this arrangement. The position in Scotland and Wales wouldhave to be considered separately to ensure that the amalgamation of offices did not offend national susceptibilities;(c) that all Departments should examine the staffing of the remaining regional offices to ensure that numbers are kept at the minimum necessary to perform essential duties.R.
