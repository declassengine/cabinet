Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1953Copy No.   %CABINETOPERATIONS IN THE TRUCIAL STATESMemorandum by the Minister of defence at their meeting on 17th March the Cabinet sanctioned the action proposedby the Foreign Secretary in his memorandum (C. (53) 103) on the Saudi Arabianfrontier dispute (C.C. (53) 20th Conclusions, Minute 9).   Action had already beentaken to increase the strength of our forces in the Trucial States, and by 1st april the following forces together with their necessary transport and equipment-were ready to undertake the tasks to be assigned to them:  100 Trucial Oman Levies.300 Aden Protectorate Levies.7 R.A.F. Armoured Cars.7 R.A.F. Land Rovers recently reinforced by a further 7.Appropriate air support, which includes:  4 Lancaster Bombers (two based at Sharjah and two at Habbaniyah).3 Ansons based at Bahrein.1 section of Meteors based at Sharjah.2 frigates are in the area to support the land forces if necessary; meanwhilethey have been used to dump petrol, water and stores on the coast.2. On 2nd April the Saudi Arabian Government were informed that, while our offer of arbitration remained open, we were obliged to reserve freedom ofaction in all matters covered by the Status Quo Agreement of 1951 and the Stand-still Agreement of 1952 (these limited our movements in the disputed areas). Atthe same time further steps were taken to: -id) Move our forces into the key oases of the disputed territories.(b) Resume freedom of action throughout Trucial Oman.(c) Isolate the Saudi official, Turki, in Buraimi.(d) Intercept and detain Saudi forces attempting to enter prohibited areas, andescort them back to the frontier.3. Some 10 standing patrols have been established in the areas from whichthey can dominate the possible routes of access to Buraimi from Saudi Arabia.These areas extend from Buraimi in the East to approximately the Sabkhat Muttiin the West. Jebel Dhanna has been established as a nodal point for the logistic support of our patrols operating to the south and east of this area. Force Head-quarters of our Land Forces have been established at Sharjah.4. Saudi efforts to supply Turki (believed to have about 80 retainers, including40 with arms) by 2 truck convoys and 2 camel trains have been frustrated. air reconnaissance to date has been successful in detecting even the smallest parties ofSaudis and, unless there is exceptionally bad weather, there should be no difficultyin identifying any other Saudi convoys that may attempt to break the blockade ofBuraimi. At the request of the Foreign Secretary, our Commanders have been authorised to take air action against the Saudis only in the last resort in self-defence against a direct attack.5. If my colleagues wish me to do so I can point out the detailed dispositions of our forces on a map.A.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,17th April, 1953.44062SECRETC. (53) 12817th April, 1953
