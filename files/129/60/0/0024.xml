(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAjESTY&apos;C GOVERNMENT) -secret.(53) 12511th APRIL, 1953.COPY NO.CABINETRENTSMemorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.At their meeting on 5ih February the Cabinet appointed a committee under my chairmanship to review the proposals which had been made for a comprehensive housing policy, to consider points of policy which emergedin the preparation of the proposed legislation, and to advise the Cabinet on thescheme as a whole (C.C.(53) 7th Conclusions, Minute 3).2. The Committee have held three meetings at which discussion hascentred en rents.   We had hoped to reach a conclusion before Easter onthe method by which the rents at present controlled under the Rent RestrictionActs might be allowed to rise, and possibly also on the amounts by which theymight be allowed to rise; but unfortunately the illness of the Minister of housing and Local Government prevented our doing so.3. Schemes have been worked out, however, by the Minister and by theSecretary of State for Scotland;  and I think that the Committee would have concluded that these schemes were the best that could be proposed - subjectto further consideration of the precise amounts of the increases.   Differentschemes are needed in England and Wales and in Scotland because theirexisting rent structures are entirely different.Meanwhile there is a fundamental question which needs to be put to the Cabinet as a matter of urgency; and my colleagues on the Committeehave agreed that I should put it forthwith.4. Are we prepared to let controlled rents rise ?   There are between  and 7 million houses and flats which are subject to rent restriction.   Nothinglike all these rents would rise under the schemes proposed but a great manymight.And if we are prepared for this, do we want to, or indeed can we,pass the necessary legislation this session?   There might just be time forone Bill - though it would have to be taken in Committee upstairs.   A Bill for england and Wales has, in accordance with the directions of the Cabinet, been drafted.   The Secretary of State for Scotland, however, feels bound to say thatin Scotland the need for repairing the rent-controlled properties is just asurgent -. probably more urgent - than in England and Wales, and that ifEnglish legislation is to be introduced this session he would find it verydifficult to justify the postponement of Scottish legislation till next session.For technical reasons there must be two Bills, but it seems to him essentialthat both should go through Parliament during the same session.
5. Although the details of the schemes need further discussion,certain things are clear.   I refer to these here not with a view to decisionsbeing taken, but so that the Cabinet can have some idea what the schemes would look like?(1) The cost of repairs is now three times what it was before the war.Any increase in rents would be related to this.(2) Rents would only be allowed to rise where a house is in &quot;good and tenantable repair&quot;.   Therefore the rents would not all rise at once;many houses would have to be repaired before the rents could rise;   somecould not or would not be repaired for the comparatively small rent increases to be allowed.   These latter would have to be dealt with underthe proposals for dealing with slum houses and dilapidated houses whichthe Minister of Housing and Local Government has christened &quot;operationrescue&quot; - proposals which he would want to announce when introducing a Rent Bill, but which would have to wait for legislation till next session.(3) The scheme worked out by the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernmeut would stagger the rent increases even more than the insistence on the houses being in &quot;good and tenantable repair&quot;;  for he proposes that before a rent could rise the landlord must show that he has spent at least a certain sum on repairs in a recent period.   This would emphasise theassociation of the rent increase with repairs.The Secretary of State for Scotland does not feel able to accept this condition because rents in Scotland have been so low that landlordsmust have the increase before they can spend more money.(4) A flat percentage increase is not possible in England and Walesbecause existing controlled rents vary enormously, even for identical houses in the same street.This is not true in Scotland where rents are fairly level and very low.   Their only practicable method is a flat percentage increase, and theSecretary of State has in mind 40 per cent.   That would just about cover the increased cost of repairs.(5)        In England and Wales the Minister of Housing and Local government proposes to relate the permitted rent increase to the statutory deduction from the gross value of the house for rating purposes.   The statutorydeduction is the element allowed for repairs.   (It does not exist in Scotland).If an increase of twice the statutory deduction were allowed thatwould correspond with the increased cost of repairs.   But in some cases itwould mean a rent increase of more than 100 per cent.   Therefore the Ministerproposes to allow rents to increase by only If times the statutory deduction.This would mean, for the great majority of controlled rents, increasesranging from 1 /&quot; a week, or even less, to something under 6/- a week.(For some of the better class houses increases would be larger,)   Itwould relate tolerably well to the Scottish 40 per cent as the commonestincreases would range from 30 per cent to 50 per cent; but some would be higher and some lower.A Scottish increase of 40 per cent would, however, give landlords,not a proportion of the increase in the cost of repairs, as proposed inEngland and Wales, but the full increase, as this is considered by the
Secretary of State to be essential if deterioration of Scottish house property is to be arrested.The Minister further proposes to fix a maximum beyond whichrents cannot rise.   Where the existing rent is already near the maximumthe increase permitted would be less than T-t times the statutory deduction;where it is already at or above the maximum there would be no increase.His proposal is that the maximum should be twice the gross value of the house for rating purposes.   For the great majority of houses - all those with grossvalues of  30 per annum or less, of which there are rather more than5 millions - the maximum rent under this proposal would range from 5/-or 6/- a week to 23/-%   For over 4 million houses the maximum rent wouldbe less than 16/-,   A good many of the 5 million odd houses already havehigher rents than the maximum to be allowed and they would not be affected.(6) The Minister of Health has suggested that instead of letting agreat many rents rise, as these proposals would, the safer course might besimply to lower the ceiling of rent control, thus taking the betterhouses out of control altogether.   This would affect comparatively few houses,and not those with the low rents which are the real problem for repairs,(7) These proposals are interim.   Re-valuation for rating purposesof all houses in England and Wales is in process;  and a Bill is to beintroduced either this session (if we do not have a Rent Bill and there istime) or next session, to give effect to this.   It has been drafted.   When there-valuation has been completed, which will take 2 to 3 years, rents can be related io the new values.(8) In view of the complications created in Scotland by the systemof owner&apos;s rates and the levying of all rates on the gross value of house property, the Secretary of State projooses that the new increase of rentshould not attract either owner&apos;s or occupier&apos;s rates;  that the poundageon owner&apos;s rates payable on the present controlled rent should be stabilised;  and that an enquiry into the Scottish rating and valuation law should be set up.6, What is wanted is an immediate decision whether a Rent Bill for england and Wales alone is to be introduced this session.   If that is decided in the affirmative, the details can be further considered.Ho G-0Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S.W,1.11th April, 1953o
