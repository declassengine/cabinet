(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAjESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. (53) 142 COPY NOt-29th APRIL, 1953.CABINETTELEVISION development memorandum by the Postmaster general in March 1951 our predecessors imposed a ban on further development of television stations by the 3.3.C.    The present Governmentcontinued this ban apart from 2 temporary stations for the Coronation.This has meant the holding-up of 5 low-powered transmitting stations for theNorth East of England, the Isle of Wight (which includes the Portsmouth and southampton areas), the South West of England, Northern Ireland and theNorth East of Scotland.   It is necessary that the Cabinet should now decideif and when this ban can be relaxed.   Not only is there strong pressure fromthe B.B.C. to be allowed to proceed with its programme of development, butthe areas concerned are becoming increasingly restive at being deprived of a service that is now available to over 80 per cent of the country.   above all the 1922 Committee are deeply perturbed because in our White Paper on broadcasting (cmd. 8550) the Government gave a pledge that the B.B.C.would be allowed priority for the building of these stations and the starting ofV.H.F. sound broadcasting before sponsored television would be permitted.They say, quite rightly, that unless the Government relax their ban in the very near future there is little or no hope that it will be possible for sponsoredtelevision to be seen by the public before the next election, and they feelthat only by this means can Socialist misrepresentation about the quality ofits programmes be shown to be untrue.The cost to the B.B.C . and the Post Office of the 5 low-poweredstations would be about  if millions and the B.B.C. already have the moneythey need in their reserves.   They have indeed already ordered 6 transmittersof the type needed.   Building costs in 1953 would be some  50,000 assuming a start were made immediately after the Coronation and  150,000 in 1954,   Inaddition, private expenditure (but not coming until 1955 or after) would be some 6-7 millions for every 100,000 sets bought of which amount about a quarterwould go to the Exchequer in purchase tax.   When commercial televisionstarts there would be another sum, which it is quite impossible even to guess at,for the commercial stations and sets or adaptors to existing sets.   I gatherthat the plans of some of the commercial televisers are fairly ambitiousand more than one is proposing to aim at national coverage.Finally there is considerable pressure on me from such areas as East Anglia, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands, which will notbe served even when the 5 B.B.C. stations that we are discussing are erectedand this is likely to be increased when they see extra new commercialstations going up in areas already receiving the B.B.C. programmes.I must repeat here that there is very strong feeling in the 1922Committee  that, having accepted the principle of sponsored television,the Government will be breaking faith unless it takes early steps to enablethat principle to be applied.   At best, we could only hope that a Government
decision now to continue to hold up B.B.C, development would be accepted,albeit grudgingly, by the 1922 Committee and others in the Party, by the3.B.C. and by the areas without television, if it were very definitely madeon grounds, not of television, but of general Government economic policy.Even so, the new budget with the reduction of purchase tax on so many consumer goods (including television sets) would make such a stand very much lesseasy to hold than it has been in the past.Only the Cabinet can decide whether the economic position ofthe country make,s it now possible to go forward, but from the point of viewof broadcasting policy there is everything to be said for allowing the B.B.C.to go ahead immediately after the Coronation with their 5 low-poweredtelevision stations.If the Cabinet decides accordingly certain further points will arise almost immediately, namely(a) how to interpret paragraph 11 of the White Paper and ministerial speeches in Parliament which promised someorder of priority in B.B.C, development before the start of commercial television;(b) whether the limited number of frequencies now availablefor providing full national coverage economically foi/television should be allotted to the B.B.C. (for a secondprogramme) or to commercial television.   As the supply is limited this is likely to arouse considerable controversy between the opposing parties, and probably strong criticism of the Government by whichever party is the loser.In view of the importance of these and certain other aspects of.B.C. and commercial television development, I think it would be helpful if I could have the assistance of a small Cabinet sub-committee in dealing withthem.D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C.1,29th April, 1953.
