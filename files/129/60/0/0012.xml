THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY  OF HER  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. March 1953CONFIDENTIALC. (53) 11223rd March, 1953CABINETGERMAN FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO DEFENCE IN 1953-54Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs it is necessary to negotiate with the German Federal Government the amountof financial support which they will provide to meet the costs of Allied forces inGermany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) year July 1953-June 1954, on the assumption that the European Defence Community (E.D.C.)Treaty will come into effect early in that year. Before we can hope to bring thisnegotiation to a satisfactory conclusion, we must reach agreement with the federal government on the size of its total financial contribution to defence in that yearand must be in a position to assure the Federal Government that the support ofthe Allied forces will not hamper the building up of German contingents in theE.D.C. It is the same problem as we faced at this time last year when we negotiations-ated the arrangements for 1952-53. Owing to the delay in the ratification of theE.D.C. Treaty, the 1952-53 arrangements are now unlikely to be applied this yearand, owing to changes in circumstances, may not prove to be appropriate for nextyear.2. The negotiation will be difficult for we have few weapons in our hands.In the present state of uncertainty about the ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty and about Soviet intentions in Europe, there can in my view be no question of ourthreatening to withdraw any of our forces from Germany in the near future. Thisnecessarily puts us in a weak position to negotiate on the financial question. Onthe other hand, the German bargaining position will be stronger than last year.The Federal Republic may well be the first of the E.D.C. countries to ratify thetreaty and may have done so by the time the negotiation is completed; the pay-ment of Allied support costs in Germany is increasingly unpopular politically, andthis is an important factor in an election year; and the financial arrangements willnot on this occasion, as they were last year, be part of a complex of agreements which the Federal Government has a strong desire to complete. Even more than last year, we shall have to rely on the United States Government to bring pressure to bear on Dr. Adenauer to reach an agreement which takes account of the needsof the Allied forces as well as of those of the E.D.C. The United States Govern-ment is not without means of exerting pressure since it is to the United States thatthe Germans will have to look for. the military equipment of their contingents.3. I attach a report prepared by officials of the Departments concerned setting out the stage which has so far been reached in the discussions about the german contribution to defence. This report indicates the importance for the future planning of our defence programme of knowing, by the time of the North Atlantic council meeting which begins on 23rd April, where we stand in regard to our costs inGermany for 1953-54; it also draws attention to the opportunity which Dr. Aden-auers projected visit to Washington in April presents for the United states administration to bring pressure on him to complete the negotiations quickly, ina way which will ensure that a satisfactory arrangement is made for the supportof the Allied forces.Copy No.743934
24.   The detailed recommendations are as follows:  (i) That H.M. Ambassador in Washington should be instructed to deliverto the Secretary of State, at about the time that Dr. Adenauer is dueto arrive, a message saying:  (a) there are two major uncertainties in connection with our defence effort the level of American assistance and our expenditure inGermany after ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty. We know thatthe United States Administration is fully aware of our difficulty about the first and we are not raising this now; but the second is also causing us considerable concern, as no doubt it is to theother Powers with forces in Germany, and we are disturbed atthe lack of progress in the discussions with the Germans inParis;(b) failure to secure support costs in Germany after ratification of theE.D.C. Treaty would impose so heavy a burden on our balanceof payments and our budget as to call for a review of our defence programme;(c) unless the present negotiations are brought to a point where our support costs are assured we shall be unable to agree to firmforce goals for December 1953 at the N.A.T.O. Council meeting in April;(d) we assume that the United States Government is equally concerned to reach an early agreement on the size of the German denfence contribution in 1953-54. Her Majesty&apos;s Government think thatit would therefore be helpful if President Eisenhower would indicate to Dr. Adenauer the importance he attaches to a quickconclusion to the negotiations about the level of the Germandefence contribution in 1953-54 and provision for Allied supportcosts after ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty and ask him to seek an immediate settlement on his return as a contribution to thejoint cause of Western Defence.(ii) that, after the completion of as much preparatory work as possible duringDr. Adenauer&apos;s absence, an approach to him immediately on his returnshould be made by the three Powers, with the agreement of the other powers concerned, with the object of reaching quickly an agreementboth on the total German financial contribution to defence and on allied support costs. The Foreign Ministers, who would be meeting in Paris at the North Atlantic Council, could bring their pressure to bearon Dr. Adenauer if it appears necessary. -5. I concur in these recommendations and ask for the agreement of mycolleagues to action proceeding accordingly.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,23rd March, 1953.
GERMANYReport by officials in the Conventions with Germany the Federal Republic undertook to makea financial contribution to Western defence comparable with that of the other western countries who are members of N.A.T.O. On the assumption that theE.D.C. Treaty would enter into force in 1952-53, the Three Wise Men last yearrecommended a total German expenditure of DM. ,11 -25 milliard in a year. TheGerman Government acquiesced in the report of the Three Wise Men and agreedthat, in addition to certain other expenditure of a defence character which brought the total up to the Three Wise Men&apos;s figure, it would contribute to Germancontingents and Allied forces in Germany after ratification of the E.D.C. Treatyat an annual rate of DM. 10-2 milliard (DM. 850 million a month). The division between these two users of the contribution in 1952-53 was settled on the basis thatthe Allied Forces would get DM. 551 million a month for six months after the entry into force of the Treaty and Conventions, and DM. 319 million a month forthe subsequent; three, months. As there is now no chance that the Treaty andConventions will come into force before 30th June, 1953, the arrangements for1952-53 will not be applied. We have therefore now to consider what arrange-ments should be made for 1953-54.2. The decision about the total German contribution to defence in 1953-54-is at present being worked out in Paris in an ad hoc Committee set up by N.A.T.O.and the Interim Commission of the E.D.C. The Germans claimed in their sub-mission on their defence contribution that the maximum amount they could affordin 1953-54 would be DM. 12-175 milliard. This offer was, however, conditional on the acceptance within this total of DM. 3-675 milliard for &quot;other defence expenditure,&quot; leaving DM. 8 - 6 milliard as the contribution to E.D.C. and thesupport of Allied forces in Germany. The other defence expenditure has been examined by the ad hoc Committee and it has been shown, to the satisfaction ofeveryone except the Germans, that the greater part of it is not within the N.A.T.O.definition of defence expenditure since it relates to items (e.g., economic aid to berlin, the cost of frontier control and police forces) which these definitions exclude.The admissible figure under N.A.T.O. definitions is about DM. 1-25 milliard.3. There is general agreement among members of the ad hoc Committeeother than the Germans that this offer which in effect comes to a lower contribu-tion on genuine defence expenditure than that fixed last year-is inadequate.Apart from the inadmissibility of some of the charges which the Germans wish tomake against their contribution, we consider that their estimates of the growth oftheir resources are too low and that they have seriously over-stated the strain whichthe financing of a larger contribution would throw upon the German economy.In discussions in Paris, though the Germans have found difficulty in defending someof their statements, they have not shown any willingness to give ground on any important issues; the prospect is that it will be impossible to persuade them byargument in the ad hoc Committee to agree to an increase in the level of their pro-posed contribution and that an approach will have to be made to German Ministers.4. A draft report has now been prepared in the ad hoc Committee for presentation to the German representatives. This draft report sets out a picture of the German economy in 1953-54 as it appears to the other members of thead hoc Committee and reaches the conclusion that the German defence contribu-tion for that year should be between DM. 13-5 milliard and DM. 14 milliard; afinal decision has not yet been taken which figure should be used. The reportgenerally is intended to leave some room for compromise and bargaining with theGermans. We ourselves are confident that the Germans could afford a minimumcontribution in 1953-54 of DM. 11-75 milliard, of which about DM. 1-25 milliardshould be for &quot;other defence expenditure&quot; and about DM. 10-5 milliard their contribution to E.D.C. and the support of Allied forces. These figures are in effect a projection of those in the Three Wise Men&apos;s report, increased to take into account the growth of German resources which has or is expected to take place.43924
5.   The key figures are therefore as follows (all in DM. milliards):Three Ad HocWise German CommitteeMen Offer Proposal1952-3 1953-4 1953-4MinimumAcceptableContribution1953-411-751-25Total defence contribution ... 11-25 12-275 13-5*&quot;Other defence expenditure&quot;        ... 3-675       1-25Available for E.D.C. contribu-tion and support of allied forces      .........      10-2 8-6 12-2510-5* On the assumption that the lower figure is used.Division of German Total Contribution6. The present discussions in Paris have so far been confined to the fixing of the German total defence contribution and of the &quot; other defence expenditure,&quot;in order to determine the net figure available for the build-up of the German con-contingents and for Allied support costs (i.e., the figure equivalent to DM. 850 million a month fixed for 1952-53). In its military submission for the N.A.T.O. annual review the German Government has stated that it lacks adequate information onwhich to base a complete estimate of the cost of building up German contingentsto the European Defence Force even during the first year. The figures which havebeen submitted cover only part of the field. They are so large and the information given in support of them is so deficient that they could not be used as a basis for working out a realistic estimate. Among the many complex matters that wouldhave to be explored is the extent to which it is militarily necessary for the Germancontingents to have a large and expensive logistic support system, bearing in mindmilitary plans as a whole and the extent to which the present Occupying Powercan provide assistance from existing installations. On the other hand estimates ofthe German costs were prepared last year by a committee of the E.D.C. Powers,with United Kingdom and United States representation (the Rivet Committee),which were used as a basis for the division of the German contribution in 1952-53.The only hope for early progress on the German costing would be to build on theRivet Committee estimates, making such variations as are justified by changes in circumstances since a year ago. The United Kingdom delegation in Paris has beenasked to move the ad hoc Committee to examine these estimates as a matter of urgency; even so this examination is likely to take some weeks to complete.7. The prospect of delay in establishing the total German defence contribution and how it is to be spent is serious. Although, through the expected delay in the entry into force of the E.D.C. Treaty there is a reasonable prospect that our costs will be met by the Germans until the end of 1953, it is necessary to be able to seefurther ahead than that. If we knew that our costs would not be met by theGermans in the first half of 1954, we should have to consider our defence pro?gramme without further delay. The absence of adequate support from Germansources, besides imposing an additional strain on the United Kingdom budget,would expose us to the risk of having to make payments across the exchanges whichwould hit our economy at its most vulnerable point, its balance of payments, andso oblige us to reconsider our defence programme. (United Kingdom support costsafter ratification will be of the order of  8O- 90 million a year.) It is therefore mostimportant for the United Kingdom that the level of support which will be availablefor the Allied forces after 30th June, 1953, should be known before we commit ourselves at the N.A.T.O. Council meeting starting on 23rd April to firm forcegoals for December 1953. Indeed, if Allied support costs are not fixed by then thenegotiations may drag on interminably. But at the present rate of progress in thediscussions in Paris agreement is unlikely to be reached in time. We thereforeneed a short cut.8. The situation is complicated by the fact that the German federal chancellor, Dr. Adenauer, is expected to be away from Bonn on his visit to theUnited States between about 1st April and 20th April. The German finance minister is known to be opposed to finding any funds for Allied support after30th June, 1953, and our only hope of achieving a satisfactory solution to this problem will be, as it was last year, to deal direct with Dr. Adenauer. It is there-fore important to impress Upon him the need for a quick, settlement on his return from the United States.  It is also important to impress upon the Americans the
importance we attach to having our support costs in Germany covered. Indeed,there is some risk (to which American officials in Germany are quite alive) that theAdministration in Washington, concerned to secure ratification of the E.D.C. Treafy,might speak in terms indicating an interest in the build-up of the German con-contingents to the neglect of provision for Allied support. At the same time the americans are in a much stronger position to put pressure on the Germans than we are, since the Germans will be looking to them for the supply of heavy equipment.9. There is every indication that the Americans want an adequate total defence contribution from Germany and they are also interested in securing supportcosts for their forces after ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty. They have not, how-ever, the same need as we have for an early agreement nor for certainty on Alliedsupport costs, and unless we can convince them of our case they may be content to let the negotiations take their course. We have in practice no way of bringing realpressure to bear upon the Americans except by threatening that if our supportcosts are not assured, we shall have to review the United Kingdom defence pro-gramme ; they would not be greatly disturbed if we were to do no more than entera reservation about our force goals for the end of 1953 in the N.A.T.O. Council&apos;sreport. The only thing indeed which would really disturb them would be a possi-bility that we might reduce our forces in Germany. We have assumed that Minis-ters would not be willing to review the defence programme again, unless it were clear that we were not going to get our costs in Germany; and that we should not,therefore, threaten a review, in negotiations with the Americans merely because wedo not know whether or not we will get our support costs.10.   We therefore suggest the following course of action :  (i) Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington should be instructed to deliverto the Secretary of State, at about the time that Dr. Adenauer is dueto arrive, a message saying(a) there are two major uncertainties in connection with our defence effort the level of American assistance and our expenditure inGermany after ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty. We know thatthe United States Administration is fully aware of our difficulty about the first and we are not raising this now; but the second is also causing us considerable concern (as no doubt it is to theother powers with forces in Germany) and we are disturbed atthe lack of progress in the discussions with the Germans inParis;(b) failure to secure support costs in Germany after ratification of theE.D.C. Treaty would impose so heavy a burden on our balanceof payments and our budget as to call for a review of our defence programme;(c) unless the present negotiations are brought to a point where our support costs are assured we shall be unable to agree to firmforce goals for December 1953 at the N.A.T.O. Council meeting in April;(d) we assume that the United States Government is equally concerned to reach an early agreement on the size of the German contribu-tion in 1953-54. Her Majesty&apos;s Government think that it would therefore be helpful if President Eisenhower would indicate to dr. Adenauer the importance he attaches to a quick conclusion. to the negotiations about the level of the German denfence contribution in 1953-54 and provision for Allied support costsafter ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty and ask him to seek animmediate settlement on his return as a contribution to thejoint cause of Western defence.(ii) In the meantime work will proceed in Paris as quickly as possible on thecost of the German contingents by reference, if this can be agreed, tothe figures used last year; and the ad hoc Committee&apos;s report will be finished. There will be discussions with the German Minister ofFinance, beginning just after Easter. The intention would be to avoidreaching a deadlock with him until just before Dr. Adenauer&apos;s return.
(iii) The Allied High Commissioners should see Dr. Adenauer immediately onhis return and seek to reach agreement with him on the level of theGerman defence contribution. If necessary the Allied Foreign Minis-ters, when they reach Paris for the N.A.T.O. Council meeting, could bring pressure to bear on Dr. Adenauer. The tactics to be used tosecure the support costs will depend on the progress made with thecosting of the German contingents. The right course may well be tosuggest a projection forward of the arrangements laid down in theFinancial Convention (DM. 551 million a month for the first six monthsafter ratification and DM. 319 million a month for the next threemonths). It may be best for the intervention by the Foreign ministers to take the form of this proposal as a quick solution; this will depend oncircumstances.11. We recommend to Ministers the course outlined in paragraph 10 and seekauthority for (i) the despatch of a telegram on the lines of paragraph 10 (i) to Her Majesty&apos;ambassador, Washington;(ii) seeking the agreement first of the French and the Americans, and there-after of the other E.D.C. Powers and those with forces in Germany, to negotiation in Bonn by the Allied High Commissioners immediately onDr. Adenauer&apos;s return (assuming that agreement has not previously been reached with Herr Schaeffer) to fix the total German denfence contribution and support costs for Allied forces after ratification of theE.D.C. Treaty.March 1953.
