IS(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(53) 105 COPY NO.18TH MARCH, 1953CABINETOFFICERS&apos; RETIRED pay memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerWith reference to paragraph 3 of the memorandum by theMinister of Defence, C. (53) 99, I attach a Table showing the effectof the increases already given and of those now proposed.    TheMinister of Defence&apos;s proposal would give increases ranging from 95 to  133 a year to retired officers of General rank and verysmall increases (in some cases as low as  1 7s. Od. a year or nothing at all) to those of lower rank.    Such a departure from theprinciples of the 1952 Pensions Increase Scheme (which was designed to apply the available funds to the relief of hardship)might easily lead to a demand for higher rates for the lower ranks and might well prove to be the signal for a general demand for pensions improvements within and outside the field of Serviceretired pay.I recommend that v/e make no concessions and no furtherpromises.R.A.3.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.18TH MARCH, 1953.
