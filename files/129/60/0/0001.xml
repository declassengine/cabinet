(THIS DOCUMENT--IS THE PROPERTY OF KER-BR-ITA-NNIC MAJFSTY&apos;S -GGVEStNMENT)C ON FIDEN TLA LC.(53) 10114th MARCH, 1953.CABINETREPAIR OF FLOOD DAMAGE:EXPENDITURE BY LOCAL authorities memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local government whether there is a Debate on Floods next Wednesday or only aStatement, local authorities must be told in general terms where they stand.2. The line I propose is as follows ivAt a later date there will have to be a general settlement between, ikeGovernment and local authorities which have had to incur expenditure onrepairing flood damage or have suffered loss as a result of the floods.   TheGovernment will then have to be prepared to assist authorities which haveunavoidably incurred burdens unreasonably heavy in relation to their resources.Authorities are incurring expenses or losses on all sorts and kinds of tilings.   The Government cannot deal with all these individually;  but allcan be brought to account by any authority which at the end of the day feelsit necessary to ask for general assistance.Meanwhile there are two kinds of services for which I think thatthe Government must at once promise full reimbursement without regardeither to the total burden on the authority or to their resources.At   Coast Protection3. As in the case of sea defence works maintained by River Boards,every necessary expenditure by local authorities on the restoration of coastprotection works to their pre-flood condition should be reimbursed in full,I am sure that the House will not tolerate anything less.   The totalexpenditure under this head cannot be estimated with any precision as yet,but the amount is likely to be comparatively small since in most cases existingprotective works suffered only minor damage from the storm.4. Greater expenditure will be necessary for the construction of newprotective works at points where the heavy seas of 31st January found gapsin the existing defences and have shown the need for further protection against erosion.   Approved expenditure on new works for this purpose willrank for the normal percentage grant under the existing provisions of theCoast Protection Act, 1949.   It will be necessary to pay more than the normalrates of grant in cases where the expenditure is substantial and the localauthority&apos;s resources are limited, and this should be stated.   But each casewill be treated on its merits.COPY NO.
s3.   Restoration of Essential services. Granted that we must promise reimbursement in full of expenditureon restoring coast protection works, I do not think it practicable to distinguishother essential public services.   Essential public services such as a sewage disposal works must be immediately restored at the national charge.   this category would include the restoration of water supplies and sewerage, the clearing and repair of roads, and repairs to the structure of promenades andesplanades.6. The reinstatement of such things as cafes, public conveniences,bandstands, bathing huts, ornamental gardens, kiosks, boats and deck-chairsis more doubtful.   Some of these produce revenue directly;  none can beregarded as essential,   I do not propose that we should promise the full costof reinstating these.   But local authorities must be entitled to bring their expenditure and losses on these things into the general settlement;  and some assistance will be necessary on this account where losses have been heavy and resources are small.Miscellaneous7. Among the miscellaneous items which have already been referredto my Department are the expenses of local authorities on repairing their ownhouses.   The Government is bearing the cost of first-aid repairs to privatehouses;  the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund will bear the balance.   JLocal authoritieshave so far been promised nothing for their houses which have been damaged or destroyed.   I do not yet know how many of these there are, but in some areasthere may be a good many.   I doubt if it will be possible to avoid treatingthem like essential services and promising full reimbursement of the cost of putting them back into their pre-flood condition.   But unless my colleaguesthink otherwise I am for the time being prepared to see whether theseexpenses can be left to be dealt with in the general settlement.8, Another item about which local authorities are asking is theexpense in providing temporary accommodation for families made homeless.I propose to tell them to provide caravans;  and though they will charge arent there will be a loss.   Another item is clearing fields of debris whichis threatening to become a public health nuisance and is in any event animpediment to agriculture.   Local authorities have no duty to tackle this butin some cases they are the only people to do it.9. I must reserve my right to come back to the Treasury for a promise of full reimbursement for any particular item of work which must bedone as a matter of urgency, and which it proves impossible, without too great a row, to hold over to the general settlement.   But I do not think ,aiat it isnecessary to settle the handling of all these items now, or to refer to themspecifically in the Statement.   If there is a Debate we may be pressed on anyof them.   If we carry out the spirit of the Prime Ministers undertaking onlarge issues we can postpone decisions on minor ones.H.M.Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, S,W.l.14th March, 1953.
