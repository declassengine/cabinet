(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 134 COPY NO.20TH APRIL, 1953CABINET 2*0    ;ATOMIC ENERGY organisation memorandum by the Paymaster-general on 6th November the Cabinet appointed (C. C. (52) 93rd Conclusions,Minute 5) a Committee under the Chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal -&quot;to consider with the Ministers concerned andto report to the Cabinet whether responsibilityfor atomic research and production should betransferred from the Ministry of Supply to anon-departmental organisation. &quot;2. The Cabinet accepted (C.C.(53) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 9) the reportof the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Committee and on 14th January -&quot;(1) Agreed in principle that responsibility foratomic research and production should betransferred from the Ministry of Supply toan appropriate form of non-departmental organisation.&quot;(2)        Agreed that a small body of experts shouldbe appointed to devise means of effecting this transfer. &quot;The decision in principle to transfer responsibility to a non-departmental form of organisation was reached &quot;so that clear directions could be given to the proposedbody of experts who would be expected, not to consider the arguments for and against transfer, but to devise satisfactory means of overcoming the difficultieswhich it involved&quot;.    A specific decision was taken to reject a proposal &quot;torefer this problem to the proposed body of experts without a prior decision ofprinciple&quot;.3. Consequently the Waverley Committee was appointed with the following terms of reference:- v&quot;To devise a plan for transferring responsible-ility for atomic energy from the Ministry ofSupply to a non-departmental organisation andto work but the most suitable form for the new organisation, due regard being paid to any constitutional and financial implications. &quot;.4.        The Chancellor of the Exchequer now proposes (C. (53) 132) to announce that &quot;the Government have set on foot a review of the organisation for supervisingatomic research and production&quot;, which suggests that no decision in principlehas been reached.
5.        I hope that the Cabinet will not accept this proposal.    In the first place it would put the Waverley Committee in a wholly false position by appearing togive them terms of reference quite different from those which they really have.Secondly, it would not protect the Government from being asked whether adecision in principle had been reached:  a question which it would be impossibleto answer unequivocally without revealing the truth.    Thirdly, it would do nothing to allay speculation and unrest among the staff.6.       I recognise the difficulties which the Chancellor sets forth in paragraph 4of his paper about answering questions on the precise form of organisationproposed;  but I suggest that these difficulties could be met by an announcement in the following terms:-&quot;In order to secure the most rapid and economical develop-ment in the field of atomic energy, the Government have decided in principle that responsibility for atomic energy ought to betransferred to a form of non-departmental organisation.&quot;The Government have therefore set up a committee consisting of Lord Waverley (Chairman), Sir Wallace Akers,and Sir John Woods -&apos;To devise a plan for transferring responsible-ility for atomic energy from the Ministry ofSupply to a non-departmental organisation andto work out the most suitable form for the new organisation, due regard being paid to any constitutional and financial implications. 1&quot;It is clear that the form of non-departmental organisationappropriate in this case will differ from any existing model:overall policy must remain firmly in the hands of the Govern-ment, and the method of financial control will have to be closely studied since for some time to come almost the wholeof the cost will have to be met from public funds.    No further statement on the precise form of organisation can be made until Lord Waverley&apos;s Committee has proposed a plan andit has been studied by the Government.&quot;The Government think it right to state that, whateverchanges may be decided upon, the rights and interests of theexisting staff will be fully respected.    Consultation with thestaff representatives will take place at the appropriate time. &quot;C.Paymaster-General&apos;s Office, S.W.1.ZOTH APRIL, 1953.
