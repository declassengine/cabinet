THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY  OF  HER BRITANNIC   MAJESTY^   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1953CONFIDENTIALC. (53) 11323rd March, 1953CABINETTHE FORMER NAZIS UNDER DETENTION IN germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues should see the attached telegram from Sir I. Kirkpatrick, andespecially paragraph 3, reporting some remarks recently made by Mr. ScottHenderson, Q.C., who has been appearing for Naumann in the recent habeas corpusproceedings before the British Zone High Court.2. Mr. Scott Henderson had previously spoken on rather similar lines on 6th March, when he telephoned to one of the Assistant Legal Advisers at the ForeignOffice. He then said that, even if the United Kingdom High Commissioner wonthe Appeal which was then pending in the Naumann case, Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the Foreign Office would be in for trouble in Parliament later. He also suggested that the matter might be &quot; adjusted &quot; by an interview between himself and either the Minister of State or one of the Law Officers. We did not of courserespond to this suggestion and nothing more was heard about it.3. I should perhaps explain the incident about the barristers attire referred toin the enclosed telegram. In British occupation courts solicitors as well as barristershave the right of audience. Mr. Bathurst, a solicitor and correctly attired as such,was leading for the High Commissioner as the senior United Kingdom legal officialin Germany. One very junior lady barrister appearing with him was wearing agown but not a wig. It should be remembered that appearances in this particularcourt are very rare and that the court itself has always been indulgent on this point.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,23rd March, 1953Copy No.43942
No. 316From Wahnerheide (Sir I. Kirkpatrick)Mr. Scott Henderson in open court asked my legal adviser to convey to me thefollowing three applications  &quot; /.;   ,:(a) that Naumann should henceforth have reasonable facilities for consultinghis lawyers (Mr. Lane, the Solicitor, later asked Bathurst to regard this as an application for Achenbach alone to see Naumann);(b) that he should have reasonable facilities for business interviews; and(c) that he should have a reasonable supply of books.2. Bathurst commented that Naumann had received all the books for whichhe had asked and had made no complaint about lack of books. (Mr. ScottHenderson&apos;s complaint in this respect arises out of the fact that Frau Luchtattempted to deliver at the prison an unsolicited parcel of books weighing 5\ kilog.,and this consignment was refused.) Mr. Bathurst undertook to pass the applicationsto me.3. In private conversation Mr. Scott Henderson told my legal adviser that wehad not heard the last of the public criticism in the United Kingdom of my decisionto deny access to counsel. It would not surprise me to find that Mr. ScottHenderson used his complaint to Sir Hartley Shawcross (as Chairman of the BarCounsel) about robes worn by English barristers in Allied High CommissionCourts (Fitzmaurice&apos;s letter to Bathurst dated 10th March, 1953) as an opportunityto incite the latter to write to The Times as he did on 24th February. I have reasonto believe that although Shawcross has since been silent, probably because he learnedsomething of the personalities in the Naumann case, he intends to return to the attack now the case is over.4. I need take no immediate decision on the applications (a) and (b) referredto in paragraph 1 above and I hope that events will move sufficiently quickly toavoid that necessity. I have no doubt that Mr. Scott Henderson will exploit as faras he can any delay in my deciding, and any denial of his applications, in order to stir up public criticism in the United Kingdom. I shall therefore be glad to haveyour authority to grant these applications under the following conditions if in aweek&apos;s time no action has been taken which renders the decisions unnecessary:  (a) I would propose to offer to allow Scott Henderson, Lane and Achenbachtogether to see Naumann in Werl prison in the presence of the registrar of the Allied High Commission Courts for the British Zone whom Iunderstand the chief judge would allow to attend. I should order that the interview be conducted in a language which the Registrar understands.It would not exceed one hour. The purpose of the interview would beto allow the lawyers to discuss only the question of a further petition tothe Court of Appeal for an order in the nature of habeas corpus. Ifthey attempted to discuss anything else the Registrar would be under instructions to terminate the interview. I would thus be making adecision on the same lines as the order made by the High Court andupheld by the Court of Appeal in the recent case.(b) I should allow the business interview between Frau Lucht and Naumannon a basis similar to that of visits of relatives to discuss domestic matters.The interview would take place in the sight and hearing of a prisonofficial and of an intelligence officer. It would be. confined to. businessmatters openly discussed, and any discussion of other matters, orattempts to convey information of another kind, would cause the inter-view to be terminated. The interview would not exceed half an hour.It would be conducted in German.5.   I shall be glad to have your instructions.
