(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^-GOVERNMENT)SECRET /- &apos; LC. (53) 141 COPY NOv25th APRIL, 1953.CABINETMEASURES FOR THE RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENTIN NORTHERN Ireland memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Minister for Welsh AffairsAfter our last discussion of this subject (C.C.(53) 28th Conclusions,Minute 8) officials were asked to examine the possibilities of additionalGovernment orders being placed in Northern Ireland.   A copy of their report is at Annex A.   This is not very encouraging.   It suggests that little can bedone to provide more employment in the shipyards, and that the possibilitiesof further Government orders for textiles and clothing are severely limited.I feel in any case rather doubtful whether the present is the right time toconsider placing orders for textiles and clothing, since activity in these industries in Northern Ireland has shown a marked revival in recent months,and unemployment has fallen sharply.   Moreover, these industries mainlyemploy women, whereas it is men who constitute the bulk of the hard core ofthe unemployed in Northern Ireland.   The aircraft industry seems to offer amore hopeful line for expansion, and it is encouraging to know that moreaircraft work is likely to be placed in Belfast in due course.   I think it would help the Minister of Finance, Northern Ireland, if he could be allowed to make some general preliminary announcement about this in his Budget speech on 5th May.2. The suggestion has been made that more could be done by way of capitalassistance to industry to encourage development in Northern Ireland.   I am advised, however, that the Northern Ireland Government themselves already have powers under their Development Acts to offer very considerable assistanceto new and expanding industries in the form of grants as well as loans -assistance which goes well beyond that offered in the development areas ofGreat Britain.   These powers, and the use made of them since the war, are summarised in an appendix to the Working Party&apos;s Report which is reproduced in Annex B.   The Working Party&apos;s conclusion is relevant:&quot;We have ourselves been greatly impressed, and we understandthat many industrialists have been equally impressed, by thegenerosity of the incentives offered to induce firms to go to northern Ireland.   We doubt whether there are many other countries where the Government is prepared to do so much for the newundertaking in terms of capital assistance, special grants,provision of factory accommodation and so forth.   Yet the fact remains that the inducements are still insufficiently attractive inmost cases to overcome the disadvantages which employers associatewith Northern Ireland. 113. Another suggestion made at our last meeting was that there might be some adjustment of purchase tax on linen in favour of Northern Ireland.   I am not
Ilomyself in a position to judge the merits of a concession in this field, butas I have said, the linen industry seems to be relatively prosperous at thepresent time, and I am not sure that this is really the direction in which we want to see employment increased.   In any case, I am advised that a large part of the linen industry s output goes to exports or to Government orders,on which purchase tax is not chargeable.   In view of this the effects of a concession on employment in Northern Ireland might not be very great.4. Another proposal that has been put forward is that we should makewhat would amount in effect to an outright grant to the Northern ireland government for the relief of unemployment, and leave it to them to decide how this should be spent.   I am advised, however, that this course would be entirely contrary to the basic principles governing the financial relationship between the Northern Ireland and Imperial Governments.   I would certainlyregard it as an undesirable precedent to offer an indiscriminate subsidy,the application of which would be wholly removed from our control,5. I find it difficult myself to put forward any new suggestions as to how we might deal with the problem.   The ground was exhaustively covered in the &quot;Working Party&apos;s Report, and I think we really have to decide betweenthe various solutions considered there.   We are not, of course, tied down to asingle type of remedy;  a combination of measures, each small in themselves,might add up to something significant.    I should add that responsibility forthe relief of unemployment in Northern Ireland does not rest solely with us.The Northern Ireland Government themselves might well be encouraged toadopt a more positive and constructive policy towards this whole question.They have already been stimulated by the Working Party2s recommendationsinto stepping up their programme of building investment in housing and thesocial services (for details see Annex C) and it may be that there is more that they can do on these or similar lines to provide additional employmentlocally.   Although the cost of an increase in social service expenditure bythe Northern Ireland Government is, I am advised, likely to fall ultimatelyon the Imperial Exchequer through a reduction in the Imperial Contribution,this seems in principle a better way for us to help them than by directmeasures of relief,D.M.F.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.1.25th April, 1953.
ANNEX ASCOPE FOR ADDITIONAL IMPERIAL government orders IN NORTHERN IRELAND.Report by an ad hoc group of officials. The scope for the placing of additional Government orders inNorthern Ireland is limited by the nature of the capacity available there, whichis mainly in the textiles and clothing industries, shipbuilding and engineering.In fact, textiles and clothing account for nearly half of all manufacturingoutput in Northern Ireland and shipbuilding and engineering for a furtherquarter.   Apart from shipbuilding, there is a good deal of spare capacityavailable in these industries at present, but much of this will be unsuitable forGovernment orders.   The main opportunities are reviewed in the following paragraphs.2. Textiles and clothing   The rearmament programme has meantincreased orders for many of the main products of the Northern Ireland textiles and clothing industries - i. e. stores made of linen/union and flax, especiallycanvas, and light clothing such as shirts and underwear.   The value of orders placed in Northern Ireland under ordinary programmes from April 1950HoSeptember 1952 was of the order of  11 millions.   In addition orders were placed under the Textile Acceleration Scheme for the express purpose of affording relief to areas of acute unemployment.   Northern Ireland was originally allocated about  1.5 millions of the total  20/25 millions which itwas envisaged would be spent under the Scheme, but following representations from Northern Ireland the amount was raised with great difficulty to over 3 millions.   When the Textile Acceleration Scheme ended in September 1952,orders to the value of about  3 millions had been placed in Northern Irelandout of a total Ministry of Supply &quot;spend&quot; of  18. 7 millions.   These orderscovered items in wool, cotton, flax, linen/union, hosiery, processing, and&quot;making-up&quot;.3. Together with the orders under the &quot;normal&quot; programme,therefore, about  14 millions worth of clothing and textile orders were placed in Northern Ireland between April 1950 and September 19520   Theresults, however, have been disappointing.   Deliveries under the TextileAcceleration Scheme have in many cases fallen behind the agreed dates.Particular examples are sheets and pillowcases (50% shortfall on the average)and shirts (40% shortfall).   This has resulted in embarrassment to the customer department and financial difficulties to the Ministry of Supply.4. One consequence of the Textile Acceleration Scheme is that verylittle has been left to order in 1953/4 under the rearmament programme.   Onthe basis of fulfilling current Service demands, which are conditioned by themoney they have available, it is not possible to suggest any additional items of clothing or textiles which could be contracted for in Northern Ireland.Investigation of a list of clothing items recently suspended by the War Office for financial reasons, however, shows that it might be possible to considerplacing some small orders for miscellaneous items of clothing such ascotton drawers, khaki flannel shirts and denim overalls.   The total value ofthese orders might amount to about  800,000, of which up to  300,000would represent work carried out in Northern Ireland, providing perhaps 400man-years of employment.   It could not be assumed that such orders would necessarily go to the areas suffering most from unemployment.
1%Z5. Shipbuilding and ship-repairing    Of the 11,400 men employedin Harland and Wolffs shipyard at Belfast, 5,100 are already engaged on naval new construction.   All the slipways are occupied and are earmarked for further vessels - cargo ships, tankers and warships.   Further government orders would have no immediate effect on employment.6, Most of the shipyard unemployment in Belfast is in any caseconcentrated in the fitting trades.   Of the 1,860 shipyard workers unemployed in Northern Ireland over 1,500 consist of carpenters and joiners (880)painters, plumbers and labourers.   Their unemployment is largely due to the virtual cessation of the construction of passenger liners at Belfast on which the shipyard was engaged in the immediate post-war years.   These trades arecommon to the shipbuilding and building industries.7. The suggestion has been made that more employment could befound for ships&apos; fitters by arranging for the re-fitting of liners in NorthernIrish yards.   The difficulty is that Harland and Wolffs shipyard at Belfast ispredominantly a building yard.   The  firm carry out very little ship repair work at Belfast,   They have extensive repair works at the major terminal ports forliners, viz. London, Southampton and Liverpool, and there is little prospect of persuading the Shipping Companies to send their liners to Belfast for overhaul,since their organisations for maintaining their ships are situated at the terminalports.   Moreover, the development of Belfast for liner repairs requiringextensive use of dry docks would present difficulties, since dry-dockingcapacity is frequently needed for the new merchant ships and warships built at Belfast.8. Voyage repairs to the nine Government-owned troopships must becarried out at their terminal ports, viz. Southampton and Liverpool.   Whenmajor repair work is required to these ships, the port at which it is to bedone is settled by interdepartmental consultation.   Regard is paid to theamount of work to be done (which is usually not extensive), to the needs ofthe various ship repair areas for work, to the cost and to the convenience of thetechnical staff of the Shipping Companies who manage the troopships.   Thereis no substantial job of this kind in prospect which could be of any help to northern Ireland,9. Aircraft    The Ministry of Supply are about to place a productionorder with Short and Harland Ltd. for a new Naval reconnaissance aircraft,which this firm has designed.   The contract will have a total value of nearly 4 millions, representing about  2-^ millions for Short and Harland in airframeconstruction and assembly of the aircraft.   This work will employ at peakabout 1,500 workers, but since deliveries are not due to start until 1955/56,not more than a few hundred will be required by the end of 1953,   arrangements are already being made by Vickers Armstrongs to place substantial sub-contracts for Swift components with Short and Harland,   If the rate of output of Swiftsis increased to 35 a month (as is at present planned), this will provide employment at peak for some 1,000 workers at Belfast, but this will not beuntil April 1955.   Neither of these measures therefore will provide muchadditional employment by the end of this year, but they hold out good prospects for later years.10, Works for the Services and Civil Defence   The Working party of Employment Policy in Northern Ireland suggested the possibility of theService Departments locating more of their establishments in Northern Ireland,We are satisfied, however, that there is at present little scope for additionalspending in this direction.   The Air Ministry have spent some  3 millionsdeveloping bases in Northern Ireland during the last few years;  with the latest
revision of defence plans no further significant work is required.   The WarOffice have no requirement for new establishments in Northern Ireland,apart from the possibility of building a military hospital there;  even if it was eventually decided to build a new hospital, the additional employment providedwould be very small.   The Admiralty have a project for a new dock atLondonderry, but this has not yet been finally approved, and no work could be started for at least a year or two.   Incidentally they already have in hand thereconstruction and extension of the runway at the naval air station Belfast,costing about  1 million.   As for Civil Defence, we are informed by the HomeOffice that there would be no justification at present for additional spendingon works (e.g. storage, rest centres, hospitals) in Northern Ireland.ANNEX BPOST-WAR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN, NORTHERN IRELAND.1.   Methods UsedMost of the measures taken to encourage post-war industrialdevelopment in Northern Ireland have been taken under powers conferred upon the Government by the 1945 Industries Act.   The 1945 Act (a) empowersthe Ministry of Commerce to acquire land, to build, lease or adapt premises and generally to provide or assist in the provision of sites and buildingsrequired for industrial purposes;   (b) enables the appropriate Ministries toassist with grants or loans towards the cost of providing basic services in industry, e. g, workers&apos; houses, roads, &amp;c. ;  and (c) confers a-very widepower to make annual outright grants and loans generally for the purpose ofindustrial undertakings likely to create employment.   (In cases where a factory is not provided by the Government, expenditure by the applicant on theacquisition or erection of premises may be taken into account in determining the amount of grant that should be offered.)The power to offer loans under the  Act has been used only in exceptional cases in accordance with general United Kingdom policy.   Thepower to offer grants has, however, been freely used.   Although there is no statutory limit on the percentage of grant which may be offered, in practicepayments are usually limited to one-quarter of the capital expenditure on the plant and machinery necessary to operate the new undertaking and are notspread over a longer period than five years.   So far the amount of outrightgrants offered to new or expanding industries under the 1945 Act is  1,200,000,of which some  660,000 has already been paid.It will be seen that the assistance offered by the Northern ireland government towards industrial development has, particularly in the past fewyears, gone well beyond what has been available even in the Development Areasin Great Britain.   The only limiting factors in the provision of government assistance have been:   (a)  the number of industrialists coming forward with proposals for development;  and (b) the policy (implicit in the Acts themselves)of offering assistance only in cases where such assistance is considered necessary to secure a permanent increase in employment.The Government has built 9 factories of a total floor area of460,000 square feet in the Belfast area and 10 factories of a total area of 587,000square feet in other localities.   In addition 3 factories of an aggregate floorarea of 208,000 square feet are under construction or planned in Belfast, while
8 factories totalling 3 54,000 square feet are planned or under constructionelsewhere.   Of this total 18 factories were x^lanned for particular tenants,whilst the remaining 12 were started as Advance factories to be available forletting to selected tenants.   Tenants have already occupied or been selected for 6 of these Advance factories.   The early provision of further advance factories is contemplated, and locations are under consideration.In addition, the Ministry has bought or has agreed to buy fromthe Ministry of Supply six factories of a total floor area of some 464,000 square feet, in Belfast (3) and in Derry (1), Lurgan (1) and Newtownards (1) respectively.The factories are normally let on 15 or 21-year renewable repairing leasesat rack rents which for the first ten years of the initial term are assessedon 1939 letting values.   In three other cases existing buildings with a floor space of 107,000 square feet were bought and adapted for the use of tenantspreviously obtained.Other assistance to industrialists includes substantial orcomplete relief from local rates and the provision of houses for key workers and managerial staff.   Industrial premises in Northern Ireland are exempt from local rates to the extent of 75 per cent.   Moreover, local ratingauthorities have power to grant complete exemption for a period not, exceedingten years in cases where the establishment of the undertaking has been helpedfinancially by the Ministry or where the premises or site have been providedby the Ministry.   Local authorities have complete discretion in this matter,but the Ministry has found that most of them are willing to grant the concession.Effective liaison is maintained between industrial development and housing authorities.   Key workers who can be certified by the Ministry ofCommerce as having been brought into a district for a purpose calculated topromote the provision of employment, are given priority for houses built by the Local Authority or by the Northern Ireland Housing TruSt, which is aGovernment-sponsored body responsible for providing workers&apos; houses.Should it not prove possible to secure adequate accommodation in this way, industrialists may undertake the erection of houses for letting tokey workers, in which case, and provided the area of the house does notexceed 1,050 square feet, they may qualify for payment of the subsidy granted for the encouragement of private building under Northern Ireland housinglegislation, which may amount to as much as  500 per house.Houses for executives and directors of new industrial undertakingsmay also be erected under licence subject to a maximum size of 2,000 square feet.Housing of this type does not qualify for subsidy under the housing legislation,but essential expenditure under this head may rank for the purpose of the grantsoffered by the Ministry of Commerce under the terms of the 1945 Act,2.   Results AchievedThese may be briefly summarised as follows:-(a) Since the war 105 undertakings have been established orexpanded with financial assistance under the 1945 Act, and theseare at present giving employment to over 13,000 people,(b) In addition to the undertakings which have been establishedor expanded with some form of financial assistance under the various industries Development Acts there are a further 60 which have beenestablished without financial assistance but with co-operation, e. g.
Government sponsorship for the allocation of raw materials, houses for key workers, etc.   These are now providing almost 5,000 jobs,(c)  In all 226 projects have been established or expanded with government assistance and co-operation, and of these only 19,which were planned to give ultimate employment to 2,750, have sofar ceased production.Firms which have established themselves in Northern Ireland since1945 include:-Jeremiah Ambler &amp; Son Ltd.Bengers Ltd.Berkshire Knitting (Ulster) Ltd. (U.S.A.)Birmingham Sound Reproducers Ltd.Blackwood Morton &amp; Sons Ltd.Bovril Ltd.British Brehmer Ltd.British Tabulating Machine Co, Ltd.British Vacuum Cleaner &amp; EngineeringCo.

This has been done under the terms of the Re-equipment ofIndustry Act (Northern Ireland) which is regarded as the natural complement to theIndustries Development Acts,   This measure empowers the Ministry of Commerceto provide grants, not exceeding one-third of the total cost, towards expenditure incurred by existing firms in re-equipping and modernising their undertakings.The response of industry to the facilities provided under the Act has beenencouraging.   A total of 134 schemes of re-equipment involving a total capitalexpenditure of  6,600,000 have so far been submitted.   The textile industry inparticular has provides some very large schemes for re-equipment of wholeprocesses.   But there is already evidence that, because of the recession in trade, firms in the textile and clothing industries are curtailing the scope oftheir plans and postponing the execution of some highly desirable items of re-equipment.
ANNEX CSOCIAL INVESTMENT IN NORTHERN IRELANDThe V/orking Group on Employment Policy in Northern Irelandattached considerable importance to the stepping up of building investment in Northern Ireland, particularly in housing and the social services.   Itwas recognised that this was not a permanent remedy for unemployment, butit was considered to offer the best hope of relieving the immediate xaroblem.In accordance with the Working Group&apos;s recommendations the NorthernIreland Government have subsequently increased their programme of social investment for 1953 and 1954 to the maximum which they believe to be feasibleon technical and administrative grounds.   The increase in the programme for1953, as compared with the previous programme, amounts to rather over 1^ millions;  a further substantial increase is proposed for 1954.   detailed figures are given in the following table:Building for the Social Services  millions	1952	1953		1954 Programme		Previous Programme	Revised Programme	Education	2.7	3. 0	3.3	3.7Water and Sewerage	2. 0	1. 7	2.25	2.25Hospitals	1.2	1.25	2. 0	2.4Housing	13.1	13. 1	13.1	13.9Total	19.0	19.05	20. 65	22. 25(1)  These figures are taken from the latest programme submittedby the Northern Ireland Government to the Investment programmes committee;  they do not correspond exactly with the programmesrecommended by the Working Group, as shown in Table 9 of theirReport.   Actual investment in 1952 has turned out higher thanestimated last August when the Working Group reported.
