secret.(53) 131 COPY NO.b^18TH APRIL, 1953CABINETTHE sudan memorandum by the Minister of state the main purpose of my recent visit to the Sudan (some notes on whichwere circulated in C. (53) 121) was to encourage the British officials not to loseheart and to stiffen the pro-independence Sudanese to stand up to the Egyptians.2.       An important subsidiary purpose, however, was to clear the way for elections to be held before the rains.    Everyone agreed that delay would favour the Egyptians.    I cleared up the difficulty over the appointment of theGovernor-General&apos;s Commission and procured the issue by the Egyptian Govern-ment of the decree appointing the Commission.    I also urged upon the IndianChairman and the United States member of the Electoral Commission, and on many others, the necessity for early elections.    When I left Khartoum, theprospects appeared to be reasonably bright.    Unfortunately, the pro-Egyptianparties have obstructed successfully, aided by the fact that the Umma andSocialist Republican Party were not in agreement about the number of   ^^J^x^t^constituencies where indirect elections should take place, and the pro-EgypliaifSouthern representatives threw an unexpected spanner in the works by sayingthat elections in the South were impossible after April.    According to ourlatest information from the Sudan, it now appears obvious that the ElectoralCommission will postpone the elections until the autumn.    This is a set-back.3.        The Egyptians will make full use of the intervening period for propaganda, aimed at undermining British influence and securing the election of as many pro-Egyptian candidates as possible.4.        We must take counter-measures.    The Governor-General has been taking a very restricted view of what is his duty.    The Prime Minister hassought in his telegrams Nos. 513 and 533 to encourage him and his officials.But it is true that the Sudan Government must preserve an outwardimpartiality.    Therefore, much of the counter-action in the Sudan must beundertaken by other agencies.5.        Since the Agreement of February, 1953 an official representative ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government has been established in Khartoum.    He is being given the title of Trade Commissioner, although his duties will include both political and propaganda work.    The official chosen for this post is Mr. Riches,an experienced Arabist who has served under the Governor-General when thelatter was in the Foreign Service.    He arrived in Khartoum at the end ofMarch, and is now actively engaged in setting up his Office.6.        He will be joined very soon by an Information Officer, also an Arabistand an experienced Publicity Officer, to assist him in publicity matters, andan Information Office is being set up.    It will be supplied with the full serviceof material from the Central Office of Information designed for the purpose
of maintaining British prestige.    Booklets already translated into Arabic willbe supplied by our Regional Information Office at Beirut.    British films andnewsreels dubbed in Arabic will be sent by our Regional Films Officer in Cairo.A public reading room equipped with Arabic reading material, pictorial displaysand wireless will be opened as soon as possible in Khartoum.7.       A sum of  10,000 was provided in the current budget against the possibleneed for Information operations in the Sudan this year.    The estimates for this sum were drawn up in the autumn of 1952,    But in view of the deterioratingpolitical situation and the intensification of Egyptian propaganda, an additional 10,000 will be required if the work of the Information Office is to play a fulland effective part in the carrying out of our policy.    This will have to beprovided by supplementary vote, though it would doubtless be desirable toinclude this sum, if possible, inconspicuously   in some larger amount, e, g. forthe Trade Mission as a whole.    Experience alone will show whether this totalof  20,000 will be adequate to meet the special requirements of the Sudan.8.        In addition to the measures set out above, the B.B. C. Arabic Serviceand other British &quot;controlled Arabic Services have been asked to pay particular attention to the Sudan in their programmes.    They already take every opportunity of refuting false Egyptian allegations and have been instructed toplug the themes (a) that elections must be held as soon as possible, and (b) thatthe Sudanese should see to it their country is free to choose its own destiny,9.        Consideration is also being given to the possibility of increasing thepower of the Sudanese Radio Station (Radio Omdurman) and to suggestions whichmight be put to the Sudanese Government for more effective programmes to be broadcast.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government may have to finance some of these improvements.10.        If our prestige and influence in the Sudan are to be maintained over thelong term it is important that the present high standard in the teaching of english should be maintained, and that the English language should continue tobe a vehicle for instruction in advanced studies.    When the Department ofEducation is Sudanised, direct British control over it will cease.    Much canhowever be done in the way of maintaining standards by organising lectures inthe Sudan for teachers of English designed to maintain and improve the standardof teaching, and by providing well-stocked English libraries and current informa-tion on educational developments in the United Kingdom.    For this purpose itis urgently necessary that the British Council re-open in Khartoum, whence theywere withdrawn in 1951 for reasons of economy.    Their re-opening, for whichthe Governor-General has pressed, would also be very valuable locally as an indication that we intend British influence to remain in the Sudan.    To re-starttheir work on an adequate scale a supplementary grant of  20,000, rising to 26,000 in a full year, would be needed.11.        I recommend that the expenditure proposed in paragraphs 7, 9 and 10above be authorised.12.        There is now one English language paper in Khartoum running at a lossof  8,000 a year, and likely to close down at the end of 1953.    We are seeking to prevent this and will also ask our Information Officer to make recommenda-tions for subsidising an Arabic newspaper13. The effect of the above measures may not be great at first. The realtask will fall upon the British officials in the Sudan. So far they have been, inmy view, unnecessarily defeatist about the prospects of an independent Sudan,but they still have great influence which they should be encouraged to exert.
14.        There are other measures which should be taken which I will mentionorally.15.        The brightest aspect of this matter is the fact that the Egyptians alwaysover-play their hand.    Our latest information is that Sayed Abdel Rahman is beginning to resent bitterly the Egyptian propaganda and bribery.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.18TH APRIL, 1953.
