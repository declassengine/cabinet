Printed for the Cabinet. May 1953SECRET Copy No.     J jC. (53) 15011th May, 1953CABINET ^BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE: BAMANGWATO SUCCESSIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations reported in December 1952 (C. (52) 455) on Bamangwato affairs up to theend of the year. At that date the kgotla, held in November to designate a newChief, stood adjourned until after the planting season.2. This kgotla was resumed on 4th May. The tribe again failed to reach agreement, despite the ample opportunity given and all the Administration^ efforts.3. The Administration think that in the end the Bamangwato will turn to anew Chief. But, left to make up their own minds, they may take a long time todo so.4. In the interval, direct rule, i.e., by the European District Commissioneracting as Native Authority, could continue. But it cannot ever be more than an unsatisfactory and temporary expedient. There are many functions of a NativeAuthority which a European officer cannot perform adequately or at all. The tribalorganisation suffers. Other Chiefs dislike it, seeing in its continuance a threat totraditional institutions. The Governments policy will not have been carried to itsannounced conclusion.  Sniping in Parliament and press will go on.5. I have therefore explored a more constructive course, which would notonly restore the conduct of tribal administration to African hands, but also speedthe day when the Bamangwato will accept a new Chief.6. There is in Bechuanaland law and practice a clear distinction between theChief and the Native Authority, although normally the Chief is automatically theNative Authority. The Chieftainship is the traditional institution garbed withrights and privileges from the past. The Native Authority is a separate govern-mental capacity in which the Chief or other person (at present it is the district commissioner) shoulders additional and more modern responsibilities.7. I propose to take advantage of this distinction. We have said, as did theprevious Government, that we do not intend to impose anyone on the tribe as chief. But there is nothing to prevent us from appointing an African to be NativeAuthority. Indeed the High Commissioner is specifically empowered by existing legislation to do so.8. With the full concurrence of the High Commissioner I have therefore decided to transfer forthwith the functions of Native Authority from the EuropeanDistrict Commissioner to an African, if the right man will take the job. There isonly one obvious candidate, Rasebolai Kgamane, who stands out both on merit (hehad a distinguished war record and is an experienced administrator) and as theonly candidate for the Chieftainship to emerge with reasonable support at thetwo kgotlas. The Chieftainship would remain vacant. This step, fully in accord with the terms of the Bamangwato Succession Order-in-Council and Bechuanalandlegislation, will enable resuscitation of many organs of native administrationcontributing to the well-being and happiness of the tribe, e.g., daily meetings inkgotla, native courts, development schemes, &amp;c. If it leads to Rasebolai&apos;s acceptanceas Chief, as it may, the whole unhappy episode will be closed. I hope Rasebolaiwill accept. The High Commissioner is, of course, doing all he can to insurethat he does.44192
9. If this plan comes off, I am arranging for the appointment to be explainedfully to the press here when announced. We have a very good answer to anyParliamentary criticism. The step is wholly in the interests of the Bamangwatopeople and in line with what some of the press correspondents have been suggesting,namely, that it is high time the Government again took some further positive action,since direct rule can only be a second best.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,Uth May, 1953.
