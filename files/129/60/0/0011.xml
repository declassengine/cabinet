(THIS DOCUMENT-IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC- MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENSECRETC.(53) 11123RD MARCH, 1953CABINETUNITED KINGDOM ASSOCIATION WITH THEEUROPEAN DEFENCE community memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues approved on 26th February (C.C. (53) 14th Conclusions,Minute 4) the terms of a Memorandum for communication to the French Government, annexed to C, (53) 73.2.        This Memorandum was handed to Monsieur Bidault on 2nd March andsubsequently, with his agreement, our proposals were circulated to all theEuropean Defence Community (E.D.C.) Governments (Annex A).3.        On 12th March the French Government handed to H. M. Ambassadora further Note (Annex B) containing their comments on our proposals.    this reply attempts to bridge the gap between the ideas of the two Governments.The main points of the French reply are:-(a) Discussions should continue for the moment on an Anglo-Frenchbasis.(b) There should be some link between military cooperation and British&quot;participation&quot; in the institution of the E.D.C.(c) So far as the maintenance of our troops on the Continent isconcerned, the French say they only want to make our existing commitments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.Q.)more explicit;  in fact, their actual proposals go further than this.(d) They do not consider an extension of the duration of the north atlantic Treaty, although desirable, sufficient for the present purpose of defining the United Kingdom^ relationship with theE.D.C.(e) They suggest that the arrangements for our political and militaryassociation with the E.D.C. should be set out in a protocol ratherthan in a unilateral declaration.4. As regards future procedure, the other E.D.C. Governments and theUnited States Government have all expressed satisfaction with our proposals.Whilst I do not intend to press for early discussion of our proposals in theE.D.C. Interim Commission, I propose to inform the French that discussionmust proceed in due course on a 7-Power basis and that I see no object inprolonging the exchange of written notes between the United Kingdom andFrench Governments.   I shall, however, indicate that I am willing that discussions should proceed between Sir F, Hoyer Millar and M. Alphandwho are both on the Interim Commission, in an attempt to harmonise BritishCOPY NO.
and French views and thus facilitate eventual negotiations in the interim commission.5. I propose to instruct Sir F. Hoyer Millar to explain in his discussions that the proposals we have already made represent in substance the limit towhich we can go but that we are open to suggestions as to the way in which those proposals should be expressed and presented.   Sir F. Hoyer Millarwill make it clear that the close association we desire with the E.D.C.rests not only on the maintenance of our forces on the Continent but also on other factors as well:  our joint participation in the N.A.T.O., the treaty obligations we have undertaken towards the E.D.C. and the long-standing tiesbetween the United Kingdom and her nearest European neighbours.   He willalso explain that we are not prepared to enter into any commitments relatingto the maintenance of our forces on the Continent which go beyond ourpresent commitments to the N.A.T.Q., but that apart from consultation in the N.A.T.O. we shall be willing to consult with the E.D.C. about the levelof our forces.   I see no reason to agree now that the arrangements for our association with the E.D.C, should be set out in a protocol rather than a unilateral declaration.   We must in any case see what the other E.D.C.countries think about this.6. These instructions fall within the general line of policy already approved by the Cabinet and I do not think it is necessary therefore at thisstage to trouble my colleagues with further details.7. The Minister of Housing and Local Government has suggestedin .C (53) 108 that it is a mistake to make any further concessions to theFrench.   On the question of tactics I agree with him and I am not in factproposing to offer further concessions.   It is, however, the policy of her majesty!s Government and of the United States Government to support theE.D.C, plan and to try to secure the early ratification of the E.D.C. treaty as the quickest method of obtaining a German defence contribution.   I donot recommend any modification of that policy,A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,23rd March, 1953.ANNEX AINTERIM COMMISSION OF THE CONFERENCE FOR THEORGANISATION OF THE EUROPEAN DEFENCE community note BY THE UNITED KINGDOM DELEGATION,Association between the United Kingdomand the European Defence CommunityHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom believe that theengagements which they have already undertaken towards the E.D.C., notably the treaty of 27th May, 1952 between the United Kingdom and the member statesof the E.D.C. and the presence of strong British forces on the continent which
will operate side by side with the European Defence Forces under the command of SACEUR, require alike the closest co-operation, not only at the technicallevel, but also between the United Kingdom authorities and the institutions of the E.D.C.In the note which the United Kingdom Delegation circulated on 3rdFebruary, Her Majesty&apos;s Government suggested practical measures for theassociation of United Kingdom Forces with the European Defence Forces.They have also been giving careful consideration to the best means ofestablishing a close relationship between the United Kingdom and thepolitical institutions of the E.D.C.  Their conclusion, which will, of course, besubject to consideration with the 6 Governments, is that the most effectivelinks might be:-(a) to appoint a special mission to the Board of Commissioners of theCommunity, in order to establish the closest day-to-day liaison with the Board and to participate in any joint United Kingdom/E.D,C.machinery required to handle the practical problems of co-operationbetween United Kingdom Forces and the European Defence Forces;(b) to appoint a representative to attend special meetings of the Councilof Ministers of the E.D.C. to discuss the general policy of UnitedKingdom/E,D.C. co-operation and to consult on matters of mutualconcern, including the level of United Kingdom and E.D.C. forces to be maintained on the continent at any given time.In the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government such links, made necessary by practical requirements and by the treaty engagements between the UnitedKingdom and the E.D.C. would provide machinery for effective and continuousco-operation and consultation between the United Kingdom and the E.D.C.and would permit the development of the intimate relationship which they believe is desired as much by the members of the E.D.C. as by themselves.The E.D.C. is intended to strengthen the defence of the north atlantic area and to be effectively integrated into the North Atlantic Treaty organ&apos;isation (N.A.T.O) framework.   The obligations which Her Majesty1s Governmenthave undertaken in the United Kingdom/E.D,C. treaty and in the tripartite declaration are in fact connected with their membership of the N.A.T.O. Anextension of the North Atlantic Treaty to make it co-terminous with the E.D.C,Treaty, as suggested in the declaration signed by the Foreign Ministers of the member countries of the E.D.C. on 27th May, 1952, would not only underlinethe relationship between the N.A.T.O. and the E.D.C. but would alsoautomatically extend the obligations of the United Kingdom for a correspondingperiod and would thus provide an additional safeguard to the members of theE.D.C.  Her Majesty&apos;s Government are willing to join in a proposal to the otherN.A.T,0. countries to extend the North Atlantic Treaty for an additional periodof 30 years.Her Majesty&apos;s Government are confident that their firm support for theE.D.C. is clearly demonstrated by their proposals for military associationat a technical level, by their readiness to work out on the above lines a systemof close association with the military and political institutions of the E.D.C.and by the far-reaching international commitments which they have already undertaken.   If the idea commends itself to the E.D.C. Governments, her majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to rehearse in a formal declaration theengagements which they have already taken towards the E.D.C. and such measures as may now be agreed to achieve the closest possible association between the United Kingdom and the E.D.C.
ANNEX BTRANSLATION OF FRENCH MEMORANDUM DATED12th MARCH, 1953.The French Government have carefully studied the memorandumaddressed to them by the United Kingdom Government on 2nd March inreply to the proposals presented by M. Bidault to Mr. Eden in London on,12th February about the association of the United Kingdom with the european defence Community (E.D.C.).The French Government consider that the British reply containsseveral positive suggestions, to which reference is made later, but they must also state that the British reply is animated by a very different spirit fromthat which inspired the memorandum of 12th February.The French Government are convinced that if the British counter-proposals are maintained in their present form it would be extremely difficultto overcome the difficulties which were brought to the attention of the BritishGovernment during the London conversations.They consider however, that there is less divergence between therespective points of view of the two Governments than would appear at first sight.   Further careful study of the question should therefore make it possibleto find the basis for agreement which both sides seek.Be that as it may, there would not seem to be much advantage inengaging in premature discussion of the French and British proposals in the interim Commission.   Such a discussion might well make the task of the twoGovernments considerably harder.   It therefore seems better that the exchangeof views should for the moment continue between the French and british governments.II. The French Government consider it would be useful to clarify two important points in their memorandum which seem to have caused difficulties.There is first of all the question of linking up the arrangements foreseenin Article I of the draft protocol submitted on 20th February with thearrangements of Article IV about the political participation of the. UnitedKingdom in the institutions of the Community.The French Government are happy to note that the British Governmentfor their part also attach great importance to the establishment of the closest possible links on the political plane between the United Kingdom and the E.D.C.They note with satisfaction that the arrangements envisaged by the BritishGovernment go beyond a purely technical liaison and provide, in so far as theCcimcil of Ministers is concerned, which is one of the most importantorgans of the Community, for real British participation at meetings at whichquestions of co-operation between the United Kingdom and the E.D.C. are discussed.Although the British reply in this respect does not go so far as theproposals in the French memorandum it does however contain certain positiveelements.   The French Government would be happy to discuss this question in greater detail with the British Government.Nevertheless it must be stressed that the British memorandum does not contemplate arrangements on the military level corresponding to the specialrights which would be accorded to the United Kingdom on the political level.-4-
It would in fact seem difficult to invoke in this connection the Treatyof Assistance between the United Kingdom and the E.B.C., whose importance is fully recognised by the French Government, but which does not in any wayprovide for an organic cooperation between the British and European Forces-;The French Government therefore think it would be most useful to revert tothe idea of a link between military co-operation and participation in theorgans of the E.D.C, )111        As the French Government indicated in their memorandum of 12thFebruary they had thought in this connection of asking the British Governmentto agree to give certain undertakings concerning the level of British forces on the continent.This is the second essential feature of the French memorandum which seems to raise serious difficulties for the British side, and the FrenchGovernment wish to dispel at once all misunderstandings on this point.   Thereis no question at all of asking the British Government to undertake a unilateraland indefinite obligation to maintain British troops on the continent at theirpresent level nor of complicating in any way whatever the carrying out by theUnited Kingdom of her world wide responsibilities.   Such intentions would beall the more foreign to the French Government since she is herself in precisely the same situation as the British Government.   Moreover, the first article of the draft submitted on 20th February shows clearly that the United kingdom would have complete liberty in case of an overseas crisis to withdraw the forces which she needed.The French Government welcome the opportunity   to make thefollowing relevant clarifications:  the undertakings which it is intended toask of the United Kingdom have no other object except to state more clearly the undertakings which at present already exist within the Atlantic framework.They are intended to interpret the obligations which devolve upon all the member States of the Atlantic Pact and more particularly on Great Britainwhich, as the Memorandum of 2nd March very rightly underlines, is fullyconscious of the importance of a forward strategy for the defence of western europe.   The presence on the continent of powerful British forces including3 armoured divisions is indeed proof of the vital interest that Great britain has in the maintenance of a continental strategy.   It is for that reason that theFrench Government consider that the United Kingdom, whose security isindissociable from that of the continent, ought to reaffirm in terms which willbe explained later the undertakings which she has already given within the atlantic framework.As the British Government know, the Atlantic Pact procedure lays down that in the event of a withdrawal of troops, a withdrawal which can only take place after consultation with the Supreme Commander, arrangements must be made with the Supreme Commander in order to re-establish thenumber, the composition and the quality of the forces immediately availablefor the use of the Supreme Commander and at his disposal.The French Government freely recognise that the undertakingmentioned above is subject to the general arrangements under which the nature and size of national contributions are fixed   by the Atlantic Council within the framework of the Annual Review procedure.   They are all the more anxiousto find a formula which is in line with this procedure because the decisions taken at the time of the Annual Review may modify the volume of globalundertakings but so long as the undertakings remain in force, do not suppressthe necessity for providing replacements.
IV With this in view the Government of the Republic consider that theBritish  Proposal of a system of consultation between the United Kingdom andthe E.B.C. on the respective sizes of the British forces and those of the :Community ought to provide an essential element in the solution which isbeing sought if it were completed in the following way. -Subject to the results of the Annual Review of the Atlantic council a withdrawal of E.D.C. forces  or British forces stationed on the continent shall only follow a grave crisis affecting non^European territories in regard towhich one of the States concerned has assumed responsibilities for defence.In these circumstances consultations should have the aim of re-establishingas soon as possible the overall size of the forces stationed on the Europeancontinent, it being understood that the State which has had occasion towithdraw its forces should also replace them as soon as possible in order tocomplete the establishment of forces which it has itself guaranteed.So long as this procedure remains in force theGovernment of the UnitedKingdom would continue to enjoy political rights in regard to the Community.In other words the political participation of the United Kingdom in the organsof the Community would be affected neither by a withdrawal of forcesfollowing a grave overseas crisis nor by a reduction in the size of its forcesconsequent upon a decision taken within the framework of the Atlantic CouncilsAnnual Review, provided that the procedure laid down above shall have been duly followed.V The French Government feel that they must point out that theproposed unilateral declaration by the British Government does not entirelyfulfil the requirements of the situation.   The arrangements in regard to thepolitical participation of Great Britain in the institutions of the Communityought really to appear in a Protocol between Great Britain and the member states of the E,D,C, which should also contain details of the arrangements regarding the procedure for consultations between the United Kingdom andthe Community.VI The French Government have noted that the British Governmentwould be prepared to increase to 50 years the duration of validity of the atlantic Pact.   That is a problem the interest of which the FrenchGovernment recognise in view of the recornmendati ons presented by the 6Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the member States of the E.D.C. at the timeof the signature of the Treaty of Paris.   The French Government believe thatthe solution of this question would be a useful addition but that it could not beregarded as in itself sufficient for the purpose of defining the relationship between the United Kingdom and the E.D.C.
