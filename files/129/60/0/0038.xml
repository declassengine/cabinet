(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. (53) 139 COPY NOv24th APRIL, 1953.CABINETHOUSING policy memorandum by the Lord Privy SealAs requested by the Cabinet at its meeting on 16th April (C.C.(53) 27thConclusions, Minute 3(4)) the Cabinet Committee on Housing Policy has considered the questions of procedure, tactics and timing in relation to theParliamentary situation.2.       It would have been desirable to get the Rents Bill through Parliamentthis summer, partly in order to meet the views of the Chancellor of theExchequer and partly because such a Bill is likely to be politically unpopularand should therefore be got rid of as early as possible.   Time cannot, however,be found before the end of the Session for a Bill to deal with Scotland as wellas one covering England and Wales, and it does not seem fair to deal with england and Wales but leave Scotland untouched.   Moreover, there is a real danger that, if the Opposition adopt obstructive tactics, even one Bill mightnot be passed if it began so late in the present Session;  in that event, theGovernment would find that it had stirred up a great deal of trouble withoutany&apos; results to show for it.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends that there should beno Rents Bill this Session and that in its place the Government should introduce a Rating and Valuation Bill.   Such a Bill is already in print.   It is necessary because of the collapse of the 1948 Act, and must anyhow be introduced sometime soon.   Its interest is largely technical, and it would not arouse nearly asmuch political feeling as a Rents Bill.   It could probably be passed through all its stages during the present Session, but it would not be a serious loss if theGovernment failed to do this.3.       If this change of plan is accepted, the Committee recommends that thefollowing timing should be aimed at:-(i)    The Bill to be considered by the Legislation Committee in theweek beginning 27th April.(ii)    The Minister of Housing to discuss its provisions privately with thelocal authorities between then and 10th May.(iii)    The Bill to be published on 8th May.   By that time, the local electionswill be finished, so that the publication of the Bill will have no effect on them.   It will also leave two clear week-ends before theproposed date for the Second Reading,(iv)    The Second Reading to take place between 10th May and the whitsun recess.   The Chief Whip will do his best to find time for this,probably during the week beginning 18th May.
H7(v) The Bill to be taken in standing Committee between 10th June and2nd July.(vi) Report and Third Reading to be taken soon after 2nd July.(vii)   If the Lords cannot thereafter deal with the Bill before the summer recess, it will suffice if they complete it in the autumn, at thetail end of the present Session,4.       On this assumption, with Rating out of the way the stage is set for bringing the &quot;grand design&quot; for housing before Parliament as a single whole assoon as possible in the new Session.   The first draft of a White Paper on thewhole subject should be brought before the Cabinet before the end of July.Selected members of the Conservative Party can be told in confidence of theGovernments intentions at a suitable stage; and a Resolution can be arranged at the Conservative Party Conference, in reply to which the Governments planscan be adumbrated, though without disclosing the details of the White Paper.The White Paper should be published at the end of October, and can bediscussed in the Debate on the Address.   Thereafter, the necessary Bill orBills can be introduced immediately:  it would be best, if at all possible, tohave the whole scheme in one Bill.5.       The Secretary of State for Scotland feels that some kind of enquiry into the rating system in Scotland is called for, and he proposes to announceits appointment at the same time as the Rating and Valuation Bill for england and Wales is published.6.       I invite my colleagues to agree:-(1)   that the proposed Rents Bill should be dropped during thepresent Session and that a Rating and Valuation Bill shouldbe introduced instead;(2)   that our aim should be to keep to the programme and timingoutlined above;(3) that the necessary legislation for the &quot;grand design&quot; should beintroduced as early as possible in the new Session, preceded by the publication of a White Paper.H.C.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S.W.I.24th April, 1953.
