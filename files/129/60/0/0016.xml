(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (53) 116 COPY NO._j28th MARCH, 1953.CABINETTERMINATION OF THE STEEL DISTRIBUTION scheme memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations.The Economic Policy Committee, over which I presided in the absenceof the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have agreed to recommend to the Cabinetthat the steel distribution scheme should be brought to an end and no furtherallocations made after the second quarter of this year.   Steel supplies as awhole are now adequate to justify this step.   Some qualifications, however, arenecessary,2. The allocation system for tinplate will have to be continued.   Suppliesof prime&apos;quality tinplate are inadequate to meet all needs and cannot be increaseduntil new works are in full operation.   It may be possible to end the allocationsystem for tinplate in the autumn.3, Some special measures must be taken to control the distribution ofsteel plate, supplies of which may be inadequate for some years.   This is aserious shortage and is having a grave effect upon the shipbuilding industry.   In1952 the tonnage of new shipping started in the United Kingdom fell by 20 per cent...whereas in other countries it increased by about 20 per cent, and there is a real danger of the shipbuilding industry losing its place in the world market.   Thisfall in output is due to the shortage of steel plate, and the shipbuilding industryis now working at only 75 per cent of capacity.   This has meant not only aserious reduction in the industry&apos;s earnings and an increase in under-employment(which means higher costs) but also some decline in the labour strength of the shipyards.   The Minister of Supply is impressing upon the steel industry the absolute need to increase to the maximum supplies of steel plate for ship-building and other important uses.4. It is proposed that the control of the distribution of steel plate should be regulated by an Order requiring producers to dispose of their output in accordancewith the terms of licences issued by the Minister of Supply.   The Minister ofSupply will be advised on the operation of this system by a special inter-departmental committee, representing the main interests concerned, and thiscommittee will give special attention to the needs of shipbuilding and other essential industries.5. The system of licensing exports of steel will also have to bemaintained, but the President of the Board of Trade is reviewing this system in consultation with the other Departments concerned,6. The Iron and Steel Consumers&apos; Council, which was set up under theIron and Steel Act, 1949, have been consulted and concur with the proposals,
7. The Economic Policy Committee accordingly recommend that, subjectto the reservations explained above, the Cabinet should approve the terminationof the steel allocation system, and should authorise the Minister of&apos;Supply:-(i) to make an announcement shortly after the Easter recess that thetime is approaching when the allocation system for steel should be terminated, but that before this is done special arrangements for regulating the distribution of steel plate v/ill be brought into operation;(ii) to follow this up with a further announcement a few weeks later thatthe Iron and Steel Distribution Orders, except for tinplate, are beingrevoked.Swinton,Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,28th March, 1953.n 2 ***
