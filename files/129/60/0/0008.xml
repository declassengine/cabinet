THIS DOCUMENT IS THE^PROPERTY  OF HER. BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1953SECRET Copy No.C. (53) 10819th March, 1953CABINET7THE EUROPEAN DEFENCE COMMUNITY AND EUROPEAN UNITYMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local government when we came into power at the end of 1951, we felt that since the SocialistGovernment had taken no positive action during the formative period, to havemade any new suggestion for a.different sort of European Army and Europeanstructure would have been regarded as &quot; sabotage.&quot;2. I accepted this view at the time; although I ventured to express my mis-givings about the whole situation in a paper to the Cabinet early in 1952 (C. (52) 56).3. Are we.really sure that we want to see a six-Power Federal Europe, witha common army, a common iron and steel industry (Schuman plan), ending in acommon currency and monetary policy? (I am particularly suspicious of Herr Abson currency.)4. If such a Federal State comes into being, will it, in the long run, be toour interest, whether as an island or as an imperial Power?5. Will not Germany ultimately control this State, and may we not have created the very situation in Europe to prevent which, in every century, since theElizabethan age, we have fought long and bitter wars? It may be argued that therise of the United States and of Russia have transformed the picture. Yet the innerbalance of Europe is essential to the balance of world power.6. Is it, therefore, to our interest, even accepting the proposition in para-graph 1, to make any particular effort to persuade the French to ratify E.D.C.?7. I suspect M. Bidault (in spite of his M.R.P. background and all he has said about European unity) does not really want ratification. (Why did he &quot; pooh-pooh &quot; the fifty years&apos; guarantee, which M. Mollet, who controls the decisiveSocialist vote, has told our Ambassador and, to my knowledge, many others would make all the difference?).8. I have no doubt that M. Bidault would like to put the responsibility for the breakdown on to us. So even if we make new concessions, he will probably askfor more.9.   But must we play his game?10. It is perhaps worth reflecting what would be the position in the unlikely,but not impossible, event of an easing of the Russian tension, a correspondingAmerican withdrawal from Europe, and the emergence of a Federal Europe^dominated by Germany.11. In any event, any serious reduction of the French Military in Africa andAsia (which may result from an almost complete commitment of the French army to E.D.C.) may have very unfavourable reactions on our position in these areas.12. So why not let events take their course, and bring no further pressure onthe French?If E.D.C. falls down, then will be the opportunity for us, should we wish to seize it.H. M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W.1,19th March, 1.953.43925
