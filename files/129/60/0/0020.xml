THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1953SECRET Copy No.C. (53) 1217th April, 1953CABINETTHE SUDANNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the attached notes by theMinister of State on his recent visit to the Sudan.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,7th April, 1953.1. The Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of February 1953It was right to make it. If the 60 or 70 expatriate officials whom I met wererepresentative, that fact is fully realised by those now serving in the Sudan. unless we had made the Agreement we would have lost all support in the towns and all parties would have engaged in an anti-British campaign which would have spreadin due course from the towns. The police and even the Sudan defence force couldnot have been trusted to hold out against these pressures indefinitely (there hadbeen one police strike not very long ago which might have caused an unpleasantsituation). The country could have only been kept quiet by steadily increasing thenumbers of British troops in the Sudan.2. Egyptian intentionsThey are strictly dishonourable. They feel that they must have the Sudanfor two reasons: -- .(i) Water.-The 1929 Agreement was in favour of the Egyptians and they feelthat an independent Sudan might seek to make a better bargain forthe Sudanese.(ii) Troops. The military regime in Cairo wants to make something of theEgyptian armed forces and they know that they can only do. it withSudanese manpower. I am confident that Neguib&apos;s assurance to&apos;me&apos;that he did not want the Egyptians to interfere in Sudanese electionswas given solely for tactical reasons because he knows that recentEgyptian activities, particularly those of Selah el Din have frightenedsome Sudanese. The Egyptians had obviously been touched on the rawby my answer at the Press Conference that if there was union; betweenSudan and Egypt, presumably the conduct of Sudanese foreign affairs would lie with the Egyptian Government. The Egyptians do not want the agreement to break down. My statement to Neguib that theagreement was threatened by the present propaganda campaign, didhave some effect. They seemed genuinely anxious to&apos;reassure:me.44012 &apos;       &apos; &apos;
3. Egyptian tactics(i) They will continue the propaganda campaign but will seek to use moreindirect methods in the Sudan itself. They will put all they want to sayagainst the British into the mouths of the Sudanese political parties.(ii) They will continue their theoretically non-political activities, e.g., theEgyptian mosque in Khartoum, the Red Crescent activity, free toursfor Sudanese to Egypt, &amp;c.(iii) They will seek to disparage British officials by every way possible and inparticular by trying to get the Northern parties to attack the british administration in the South.4. Sudanese reactions(i) National Unity Party (pro-Egyptian). At present it is in full cry and feels that it has got the other Sudanese on the run.(ii) The Watari. The Watan Party is a fragment of little importance following a religious leader. It will back the winner.(iii) The UMMA (The party of the Mahdi). It is still for independence but itis nervous of being publicly associated with the British Administration;most of them still have feelings of friendship for us but they were madeprofoundly suspicious by the formation of the Socialist RepublicanParty which they believed was founded, with British support, to weaken the Umma and not just to attract supporters from theKhatmia sect. Even Sayed Abdel Rahman is still suspicious that theAdministration may put its full weight behind the Socialist RepublicanParty.(iv) The Socialist Republican Party. Its strength is an enigma.   If there areindirect elections in the North, they may get a number of seats but Ibelieve they have very little money. They are anti-Egyptian and wouldbe prepared to co-operate with the Umma for independence.(v) The Religious Sects(a) The Ansar, the followers of the Mahdi, are all with the UmmaParty, although in places where there are indirect elections andthe local leaders are not Ansar, the full Ansar voting strengthmay not be revealed in the results.(b) The Khatmia, the followers of Sayed Ali Mirghani, are dividedinto three sections politically. A substantial one is in theNational Unity Party. Another section of doubtful size is in theSocialist Republican Party. There is a third independent section and there is some talk of independent Khatmia candidates. Thedifficulty is that as Sayed Abdel Rahman, and therefore the causeof Sudanese independence, appears to gain strength, Sayed AliMirghani is bound to move in the opposite direction towards a link with Egypt.(vi) The South. It is doubtful whether they will be able to withstand theonslaught of the Northern parties and organise themselves into a solidSouthern bloc. Even if they do and, as a result of the elections, returna Southern bloc, it is doubtful, whether the individual members will retain their political integrity when Parliament meets.5. British policy assume that our objectives should be: -(a) That the Sudan should choose independence with treaty relations withGreat Britain for defence, &amp;c, and at the same time in agreement with egypt over matters like water.(b) The South should get a fair deal.(c) The hand over of power by the British to the Sudanese should take place with dignity and goodwill.I suggest that our policy should be:  (i) Support of the Sudan Government in administrative action to preservelaw and order and to ensure free elections.
(ii) Reaffirmation on all suitable occasions that whatever happens in Egyptwe will see that the Sudanese get self-government and then self-determination.(iii) The promise that, if the Sudan chooses independence, Great Britain will stand by the country and be willing to enter into treaty relations.(iv) Exposure of Egyptian propaganda and firm action to stop Egyptian mis-demeanours; seeking to avoid trouble with the Egyptians when theymisbehave will not pay in the long run.(v) Support for British Community and friendly Sudanese by honours, visits,maintenance of British newspaper, &amp;c.(vi) Hastening the decision as to the future of British officials. I deal with thismatter separately in the next paragraph.6. The Future of British OfficialsThere is undoubtedly great anxiety and uncertainty among British officialsas to their future. Of the 1,100 there now, only about a fifth or sixth will neces-sarily have their posts Sudanised. Nevertheless they feel that as political power is transferred their conditions of service will be so changed that they will not beable to stay on. It was urged upon me by all officials that a fixed date should be announced by the Sudanese Government on which all contracts would be terminatedwith suitable compensation arrangements. New terms of service should be arranged for those who wished to stay on. The advantages of this action would be that itwould be an earnest of our good faith that power is to be transferred, it wouldconfront the Sudanese with the fact that they will have to accept responsibility,it would enormously improve the moral among British officials and in the longrun it would probably mean that more British officials will stay on. The dis-advantages are that whatever may be the arrangements for compensation they willbp denounced by the pro-Egyptian parties, and the new Sudanese Government maynot have the courage to agree to a reasonable scheme. I had a long discussion onthis matter with the Governor ^General and his leading Advisers as well as the repre-sentatives of the officials&apos; association. On balance I think that it is right as soonas possible to fix a day perhaps 1st January, 1955. The Sudan Government ishastening the formulation of a scheme, but the Governor-General will await thedecision of the Electoral Commission about the elections before deciding how andwhen to put it to the Sudanese Government. The Governor-General has reserved powers under the Agreement to deal with this matter, and he may have to use them.I advise that a Committee to consider the re-employment of officers who cannotor do not desire to stay on should be appointed.7. A number of other matters were brought to my notice during my visit.I am dealing with these through the department.S. L.2nd April, 1953.
