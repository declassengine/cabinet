COLLECTIVE APPROACH TO FREER TRADE ANDCURRENCIESSTATE ME N T S AT THE COUNCIL OF THEORGANISATION FOR EUROPEAN ECONOMIC CO-operation memorandum by the Foreign Secretary and theChancellor of the exchequer we are due to make statements at the Council of the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation (O.E.C.C.) next Monday, 23rd March.    Thesev/ill be followed by a discussion in the Council and further exposition by officials at a joint meeting of the C.E.S.C. Steering Board for Trade and the european payments Union (E.P.U.) Managing Board later in the week.2.        We want to take this opportunity of keeping up the momentum for the policies agreed upon at the Commonwealth Economic Conference but at the sametime to avoid tabling a &quot;plan&quot; for acceptance or rejection.    Our general purpose will be to enlist the co-operation of the Europeans and to initiate work inO.E.E.C. on matters of specific European concern without losing our own initiative,3.        The Foreign Secretary, who will be in the Chair at the O.E.E.C.Council, will open with a statement which will set the idea of the collectiveapproach against its broad political background, will report the washington disscusions and express the attitude of the Americans in terms of the agreed&quot;Washington communique, and will impress upon O.E.E.C. the need to move forward to the wider objective and the importance of doing so in a manner which involves the minimum of risks and preserves to the maximum the gains whichhave been made in recent years by co-operation in O.E.S.C.    He will emphasise that the time has not yet come for making definite commitments and for taking up final positions about the course to the objective and that we wish at thisstage to discuss these problems and not to decide them,4.        The Chancellor will then follow with a statement which will emphasise the following points:-(a) Sound internal and development policies, particularly onthe part of the debtor countries.(b) The linking of finance and trade, so that currency policyis considered against the pattern of progressivelyliberalised trade.(c) Action both by creditors and by debtors to provide a balanced trading pattern between the U.S.A. and therest of the world.COPY NO,(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 government secret.(53) 10719TH MARCH, 1953CABINET
(d) The means to deal with the problem of inadequate gold and dollar reserves.(e) Effective use and revivifying of world-wide international institutions.This will be handled in such a way that the essentially secret elements in theCommonwealth Economic Conference proposals - viz. , the flexible rate, the convertibility of non-resident sterling, and the method of financial support -will not emerge in the O.E.E.C. Council as categorical statements of UnitedKingdom policy.5.        This would provide the setting of the problem as a whole, and theChancellor would then go on to consider the strictly European aspects of theproblem, emphasising the need for effective solutions cf the following threeproblems and our general ideas on how they should be solved:-(a) The effective continuation of liberalisation of intra-European trade.(b) The orderly transition from the European payments union to a wider multilateral system of payments and credit.(c) The maintenance of effective intra-european co-operation throughout the trade and paymentsfield.6.        This would lead to a proposal that there should be a general discussion in the Council which would not: commit anybody finally and a proposal that.E.E.C should undertake to discuss:-(a) The prolongation of E.P.U. after 30th June:  theChancellor would suggest that E. P. U. should becontinued in substantially its present form for12 months but that it should be agreed that thisdecision should be reconsidered in the event of a concerted move towards convertibility before june 1954.(b) The means of effecting the transition from an E.P.U.which by definition consists of inconvertiblecurrencies into a wider system based uponconvertibility.7.        In the course of the proceedings we shall announce the relaxation of import restrictions and tourism which have been agreed.A.E.R.A.B.19TH MARCH, 1953.
