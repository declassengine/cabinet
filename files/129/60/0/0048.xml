I Si(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET /    ICOPY NC.of ._J__C.(53) 1498th MAY, 1953.CABINETMONOPOLIES AND RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES BILE.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The Home Affairs Committee at their meeting on Friday, 8th May(H.A.(53) 10th Meeting, Item 2) approved, subject to the necessary time being found, a proposal to introduce during the present Session a short non-controversialBill for strengthening the Monopolies Commission and enabling it to speed up its work.The Bill would do two main things.   First, it would make thechairmanship of the Commission a permanent and pensionable appointment.Secondly, the Bill would empower me to enlarge the Commission to permit it towork in sub-committees or &quot;panels&quot; in order that it could pursue severalenquiries at the same time.For such a Bill to be treated as an agreed measure, it would be essential that we should refrain from using the Bill to bring the nationalised industries within the Commissions purview.   Before taking the matter to theHome Affairs Committee, I sought the views of the Party&apos;s Finance, Trade andIndustry Committee and found that there was very general agreement that the exclusion of our proposal to bring the nationalised industries within the scope ofa Monopolies Bill would not cause any difficulties.   Moreover, we can properlyargue that it would be premature to include in a Monopolies Bill provision forsupervision over the nationalised industries, at a time when the nationalised industries are being considered by a Select Committee of the House and when thereis a possibility of a Standing Joint Select Committee being set up to investigate the policies of the nationalised industries.There have been several indications from the Opposition to justifyus in believing that there is a very fair chance of getting them to treat a Bill on thelines I propose as an agreed measure.   We should, of course, seek an assurance from the Opposition on this point before its introduction.   If such an assurance couldbe obtained, the Bill would take up very little Government time - probably not morethan one day on the Second Reading - and would provide for a useful amendment tothe machinery of the Monopolies Commission, which is generally desired on both sides of the House. .I therefore seek the approval of the Cabinet -(a) to our ascertaining whether the Opposition would, in fact be readyto treat a Bill on these lines as an agreed measure and, if so,(b) for the Bill to be drafted and submitted to the legislation committee in the usual way.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1.8th May, 1953
