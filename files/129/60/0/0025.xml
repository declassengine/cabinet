(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C ONFIDENTIALiC.(53) 126 COPY NO. /Q15TH APRIL, I9fj3CABINETOFFICERS&apos; RETIRED pay memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at their meeting on 24th March the Cabinet asked for a statement ofthe repercussions of the proposal made by the Minister of Defence to restore the 1919 rates of officers&apos; retired pay (C.C.(53) 22nd Conclusions, Minute&quot;4).2.        The main effect of the proposals of the Minister of Defence, as wasmade clear in the Annex to my paper C. (53) 105, would be to grant substantial increases to pensioners on the higher rates of pension.    This involves acomplete reversal of the policy on pensions which the present Government has so far followed.    The 1952 Pensions Increase Scheme for both Service and civil pensioners was on the basis that no general increase should be givensolely on the grounds of the increased cost of living and that such money as was available should be applied to the relief of hardship as revealed by certainage and income tests.    A single man over 60 or disabled could qualify for anincrease only if his total income did not exceed  529 a year (including up to 104 a year from sources other than the increasable pension).    Thecorresponding limit for a married man Or a man with a dependant was  654 ayear (again including up to  104 from other sources).    Consequently, now togrant substantial increases on larger pensions, some in excess of  1,000 ayear, must inevitably re-open the question of the fall in the value of all pensionssince they were fixed and deprive us of the argument that all that we could dowas to relieve real hardship.Direct Repercussions3,        Civil servants&apos; pensions between 1922 and 1935 were, like service officers&apos; pensions, subject to fluctuation according to the cost of living index,but the fluctuating element was that part of the pension which represented theappropriate fraction (differing in each case according to length of service) ofthe cost of living bonus element in the retiring salary.    This fluctuatingelement amounted in some cases to much more than the 20 per cent which wasthe variable element in officers&apos; retired pay.    The percentage reduction madein 1935 on a Civil Service pension for 40 years&apos; service varied from24 per cent on a pension of  100 a year, to nil on a pension of  l,000x a year or over.    If the 1935 settlement (which incidentally was somewhat morex Civil servants with salaries of over  2,000 a year did not receive a bonuson their salaries and there was consequently no corresponding bonuselement to be reduced in pensions over  1,000 a year as there was for service officers,,
7Z.generous than the cost of living in 1935 would strictly have justified) were tobe treated as unfair to the officers concerned, it would be impossible to argue that it was not equally unfair to the civil servants treated in principle in thesame way, particularly as in practice the result for them was frequentlyless favourable.    Pensions increases under the 1944, 1947 and 1952 schemes were given to civil servants on exactly the same lines as to Service officers.These increases have partly restored the 1935 cut in the case of civil servantson the lower pension rates below  600 a year.    If all Service officers weregiven back their 1919 rates, civil servants in this range would have asimilar claim to the full restoration of the comparable 1922 rates which would cost about  215,000.    Pensioners between  600 and  1,000 would have a claim to increases of about 10 per cent costing  95,000;  and even pensionersover  1,000 would have a case (which would be strongly pressed) to sympatheticincreases of about 10 per cent comparable to those given to senior service officers; these would cost  50,000.    The total cost of direct repercussions on the Civil Service would thus be about  360,000 a year.A letter published in the Times on 14th April over a distinguished listof signatures shows that the case of the senior civilians is regarded byresponsible opinion as parallel with that of the Service officers.Indirect Repercussions4.        War Pensions.    The British Legion has put in a claim for an increaseof 35s. in the basic pension rate from 55s. to 90s. a week.    This would cost about  35 millions a year.    The cost of any smaller concession wouldbe about  1 million a year for each Is. increase granted in basic pension rates.5.        Industrial Injuries.   Experience hitherto has been that any movementin basic war pensions rates has led to claims which it has been difficult to resist for increases in industrial injuries rates.6.        National Insurance Benefits.    Increases in industrial injuries ratesin turn may lead to demands for increases in the rates of sick pay benefit andfrom them to other benefits including retirement pensions about which thereis already a measure of agitation.    Repercussions in this field would bevery expensive, particularly in the long term.    Every Is. increase in national insurance benefits would involve expenditure from the National insurance fund of the order of  15 millions a year immediately, increasing rapidly in amount with each successive year.7,        Claims for Pensions Increase.    The 1952 Scheme cost over 8 millions, of which about  6 millions falls on the Exchequer and about 2 millions on local rates.    Claims might be made for an extension of pensions increase to cover those on higher pensions excluded by the present income orage limits.    Within this field those who retired before 1946 would have astrong claim to, say, a 10 per cent increase.    The cost of such an increase for the more numerous classes would be:  Police and Fire Services  300,000;Local Government employees  40,000.    There are other classes such asteachers, National Health Service officers and others retired before 1946 who,for a variety of reasons, may in some cases be ineligible for pensions increase at present and would have a similar claim.8.        British civilian members of the former Indian Services are on pension rates which have not been changed since 1924 or earlier.    They have alreadyaslced for increases in their rates which could only be given at the expense of
Her Majesty&apos;s Government.    The effect of giving the increases proposed to senior Service officers might well be to stimulate a demand for, say, a10 per cent increase for those pensioners outside the present pensions increasefield.    The Commonwealth Relations Office estimate the cost of such a concession at about  150,000 a year.9.        The pensions of other ranks in the three Services were not varied inaccordance with the cost of living.    If officers who retired before 1946received a 10 per cent increase, there might however be a claim for a similarincrease for other ranks who retired during the same period, which would cost about  350,000 a year.Possible Further Repercussions10.       The repercussions listed above arise from the present proposal of theIviinister of Defence to restore the 1919 rates of officers1 retired pay.    If, as was suggested at the Cabinet discussion, this failed to satisfy the agitation,and further concessions were then proposed, the field of repercussions wouldbe correspondingly widened and their cost increased.11. I must add that in view of the broad measure of stabilisation of thecost of living since last summer, I do not feel that there is any very great urgency in this matter; and I would point out:-(a) that, as no pension or social benefit changes have been announced in the Budget, it would therefore bepeculiarly difficult to put forward now in isolationthe suggested increases in large pensions;  and(b) that such urgency as there might otherwise have beenis diminished by the fact that these pensioners, like othertaxpayers, have obtained scene relief from my budget proposals.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.15TI-I APRIL, 1953.
