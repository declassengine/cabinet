(53) 12310th April, 1953CABINETSAUDI ARABIAN FRONTIER DISPUTENote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate for information the texts ofmessages recently exchanged between the Prime Minister and King Ibn Saud.(Signed) NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th April, 1953.Message dated 30th March from the Prime Minister to King Ibn SaudYour Majesty,Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have to-day authorised the despatch of a Note to Your Majesty&apos;s Government which I have no doubt willbe displeasing to You. Will Your Majesty permit me to add these, few personalwords as an old friend and comrade in the war.It is my personal wish and that of my colleagues in Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat the friendship between the peoples of our two countries, which has been a source of strength and comfort in days of adversity, should prosper and continueeven firmer. I do not intend for my part to allow it to be disturbed by events whichI trust will prove only temporary.But it is my duty as Prime Minister and as a friend to point out that her majesty&apos;s Government stand in friendly relations to Your Majesty&apos;s neighbours,to whom indeed they are for the most part bound by solemn obligations. her majesty&apos;s Government have every intention of maintaining those relations and ofhonouring those obligations. If in so doing they grieve another valued friend, thatis a matter for great regret, but it cannot be a reason for inaction. What would the friendship of Great Britain be worth if she abandoned the weaker of her friendsfor the sake of the stronger?We shall stand up for what we believe to be right. Your Majesty will undoubtedly do the same, and neither of us shall think the worse of the other for it.If neither of us can convince the other, is it beyond the power of statesmanship tofind the means of reconciling our views, with justice and honour?In the meantime I pray you, Sir, to accept my respectful wishes for your majesty&apos;s health and happiness and for the welfare and prosperity of Your Majesty&apos;sKingdom.Your Majesty&apos;s friend and servant,WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.Copy No.  gHis Majesty King Abdul Aziz ibn Abdur Rahman al Saud.4403.1

PelhamNo. IllFollowing is text in translation of reply, dated 4th April, from King Ibn Saudto the Prime Minister telegraphed from Riyadh:  &quot; Dear Churchill,I have received your friendly message to which I have given my fullattention. The fine expressions which it contains have reminded me of thatdear friendship on both sides on which, for tens of years, the policies of our two countries have centred in the service of peace and humanity, and in thosehard times when we stood together side by side and during which you calledus the friend of the dark nights.All this makes me do everything possible for the maintenance and con-continuation of this friendship. The Bureimi question, in which I believe wehave the right and in which Your Excellency sees otherwise, should not bea reason for the collapse and destruction of this deep-rooted friendship. At theend of paragraph 4 of Your Excellency&apos;s message the following is stated &apos; if neither of us can convince the other, is it beyond the power of states-manship to find the means of reconciling our views, with justice andhonour?&apos;This desire finds in me a strong echo.Therefore I request Your Excellency to point out to us ways and meansleading to that, so that we may all follow them to reach our desired goal inthis problem in a way which maintains justice and preserves honour.&quot;Telegram dated 8th April from Foreign Office to JeddaNo. 301Following is the text of a message from Prime Minister to King Ibn Saud:  &quot;I have received Your Majesty&apos;s prompt and eloquent reply to mymessage.
