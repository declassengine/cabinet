(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE -PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC-MAJESTY-&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 103 COPY NO.16th MARCH, 1953.CABINETSAUDI ARABIAN FRONTIER dispute memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in my memorandum C. (52) 450 I advised the Cabinet that if we failed to persuade the Saudi .Government to agree to go to arbitration itmight be necessary to take a firm line and ultimately defend an arbitraryfrontier line which took account of what we considered to be the justifiableclaims of our friends.   On 22nd December the Cabinet agreed that theoffer of arbitration should be renewed and that  certain interim measures should be taken to strengthen our military position in the Trucial States(C.C.(52) 107th Conclusions, Minute 1).   The offer of arbitration was accordingly renewed on 5th January, and received full United States support.In due course two flights of R.A.F. Armoured Cars and a Squadron of R.A.F.aircraft were sent to Sharjah..  Later Aden Protectorate Levies were moved tothe Trucial Coast. The British Defence Co-ordination Committee, Middle Easthave reported that by a date between 21st March and the end of the monthour forces in the Trucial Coast will be adequate to deal with any Saudiencroachment beyond any line which we might reasonably wish to draw.2.   Saudi policy the Saudi Arabian Government took some time to react to theappearance of our forces on the Trucial Coast, but since the beginning ofMarch they have evidently decided on their tactics.   They have started a propaganda campaign against Her Majesty&apos;s Government which is clearlydesigned to prepare the way for the rejection of our. offer of arbitration and at the same time to build up pressure against us.   Selected documents relating to the dispute were published in Jedda on 6th March.   On 10th march the Saudi Foreign Minister held a tendentious press conference in New York.The Saudis publicly maintain that they have no quarrel with the Arab rulers;that our intervention has created the dispute;  that there is nothing toarbitrate about since Buraimi is Saudi territory and that if there is any doubt about this it can be dispelled by a plebiscite.   They allege that our actions area threat to peace and hint at action in the United Nations.3.   Position of Her Majesty&apos;s Government(a) Our legal case is good and it can stand the test of public opinion,The ciaims which we make on behalf of the Rulers under British protection andin the name of the Sultan of Muscat have been consistent over a long period.Those of the Saudis have advanced with the passage of time.   Our offer ofimpartial arbitration is manifestly fair and reasonable.   The Saudis3
offer of a plebiscite is a transparent fraud.(b) Our military forces in the Trucial States have been built up to apoint where they dominate the situation.(c) The general position in Buraimi and the disputed areas has devolped in our favour.    There has been a distinct swing amongst the tribes since january.    It is important that this favourable tendency should continue as our friends (and enemies) in the Gulf are watching critically the outcome ofthis trial of strength between us and the Saudis.(d)  But the Saudi official, Turki,   is still in Buraimi Qasis, protected by the Standstill Agreement which, however, he disregarded from the outset.As long as he remains, the allegiance of the tribes must be uncertain andour relations with the Sultan of Muscat, who is now in London, and in whoseterritory potentially valuable oil areas exist, must remain strained.4.    The next stepWe cannot afford to wait on events.    So long as Turki remains inBuraimi, Saudi intrigue will continue and so will the threat to our positionin the Trucial States and to the Sultan of Muscat in Central Oman.    the saudi reply to our note of 5th January will inevitably be unfavourable.    Thereis a further risk that, by a sudden initiative in the United Nations, the Saudiswill deprive us of the full advantage of the military superiority which wehave built up in the Trucial States.       I therefore consider that we should,without further delay:(a) Resume our freedom of action which is at presentcircumscribed by the Status Quo Agreement of 1951and the Buraimi Standstill Agreement of 1952,(b) Seal off the Buraimi oasis with the object of forcingTurki to depart or at least of rendering him harmless,5.    procedure to regain our freedom of action it will be necessary to terminate(a) the Status Quo Agreement of 1951 and (b) the Standstill Agreement of1952.    Under (a) both parties agreed, pending the outcome of further negotiations, that the areas then under dispute should be closed to theTrucial Oman Levies and the oil companies of both sides, it being under-stood that only normal administrative activities should continue in theareas meanwhile.    Under (b) Her Majesty&apos;s Government agreed, in orderto prevent an &quot;armed clash and further Saudi encroachment, to Turki remain-ing in the Buraimi Oasis, on the understanding that life there returned to normal and propaganda activities ceased.     There is little difficulty aboutterminating these Agreements.    They were intended as temporary, pending a settlement of the dispute by negotiations.     But the Saudis violated the1951 Agreement by sending Turki to Buraimi;  and Turki disregarded the standstill Agreement from the moment it was concluded.    At the same timethe Saudis have persistently refused to consider reasonable methods of resolving the dispute.    There is therefore no further justification for continuing an arrangement which was only intended to be temporary andwhich is manifestly not likely to achieve the purpose for which it wasconceived.
?6. Simultaneously with the termination of these agreements, it will benecessary tc take full advantage of the freedom restored to us by movingtroops into the key points of the area, which we regard as belonging toBritish Torotected rulers.    There would be considerable advantage inunilaterally declaring a precise frontier line.    There is, however, some difficulty in finding a line which would satisfy all our requirements.    The&quot;Riyadh Line&quot; (the line of our choice in 1935) includes all the territorieswe claim, but would require elaborate justification.    The 1935 Saudi line(which marks the Saudi claim at that time, though the Saudis now deny this)is not wholly unreasonable, but would give the Saudis the Khor el Odeid, an area which we undertook in 1906 to secure to the Ruler of Abu Dhabi.Furthermore, the declaration of any particular line might well embarrass the Sultan of Muscat, who would probably be unwilling to follow suit anddefine precisely his own dominions.7. I prefer therefore merely to declare certain key areas     (oases,route crossings, etc. ) to be Abu Dhabi, territory.    This would commit us tono particular line but a careful choice of localities would include all we want and permit us to seal off critical areas from Saudi penetration.8. The action proposed above should render Turki&apos;s position inBuraimi Oasis untenable.     At best he could be persuaded to withdraw:  atworst he would remain in circumstances of considerable indignity, whichshould be sufficient to neutralise his influence.9. We should couple such action with a further renewal of our offer of arbitration.    Not only is this procedure best suited to a dispute of this nature, but the maintenance of our offer will be of great importance in viewof international public opinion.10.   The risks involved the Saudis cannot fail to react sharx^ly to such a policy.    It isdoubtful if they would be ready or willing to attempt a military invasion of our positions.    If they did so, we should have to bring in reinforcements.It is more probable that they would immediately put the dispute to theUnited Nations.    This would certainly focus undesirable attention on ourposition in the Gulf, and would undoubtedly draw sharp criticism of us from our usual detractors at the United Nations.    I am satisfied, however, thatour case is sufficiently strong for us to make a good show in either theAssembly or the Security Council.    It is to the latter body that the Saudiswould most probably take us.    We could reasonably expect the security council to make a recommendation for the parties to settle the dispute by arbitration which would of course suit us very well.    The Council could,however, be a good deal less obliging and we cannot ignore the possibilityfor example of a resolution involving the appointment of a commission or some similar group to proceed to the spot.11.    The United States positionRelations between the Saudi-Arabian Government and the UnitedStates are very close.    The Saudis hold a letter from Mr. Truman toXing Ibn Saud which comes near to being a guarantee of the integrity ofSaudi territory.    The Saudis expect and demand assistance from theUnited States in international disputes, and are seldom disappointed.It is doubtful whether any final solution to the present problem could bereached without United States backing.    So far the United States have
actively backed our offer of arbitration.    I feel it desirable on groundsgeneral policy to keep them informed in advance of the change in ourtactics now proposed.    I do not imagine that they would immediatelyapprove, nor indeed would their approval be sought.    Nevertheless,provided we maintain our offer of arbitration, I hope we can secure atleast their acquiescence.12.    Summary of recommendations in conclusion, therefore, I would recommend that the following action should be taken forthwith:&quot;(a) Detailed plans to carry out the policy recommended in paragraphs 4=9 above should be advanced with allspeed.(b) Immediately these preparations permit, the saudi arabian Government should be informed that, whilstour offer of arbitration remains open, we consider thatthe Status Quo Agreement and the Standstill Agreementno longer apply.    We accordingly reserve freedom ofaction in certain areas which we regard as Abu Dhabiterritory.(c) Simultaneously with (b) above, forces should bepositioned in the Trucial Coast to control key points in the specified areas and bar Saudi access.(d) Steps should also be taken to isolate Turki in Buraimiand   make his position untenable.(e) The United States Administration should be informeda short time in advance of our intentions, and thereasons for our actions should be explained to them.(f) Preparation should be made for the conduct of our case should be Saudis put the dispute to the united nations.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.116TH MARCH, 1953.
