THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF HER BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENT&apos;Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1953.CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    7C. (53) 11423rd March, 1953CABINETHOUSE OF LORDS reform memorandum by the Lord President of the council the Labour Party have refused our invitation to take part in conversations on the reform of the House of Lords. This is not surprising. Some at any rateof their more moderate leaders would probably have liked to accept it, either fortactical reasons or because they would genuinely welcome a strengthening of theposition of the Second Chamber; but the rank and file of the party no doubt prefer the House of Lords in its present impotent yet vulnerable state. We need not breakour hearts over their refusal. It does, however, face the Conservative Party witha new situation and a new decision.2. No doubt an agreed solution, subscribed to by ail the main parties in theState, would have been tne ideal, if it could be attained: for it would be more iikeiyto endure. But, if an agreed solution is beyond hope and I think it is that issurely not a reason for admitting defeat and doing nothing more. After all, the parliament Act of .191.1 was passed in the teeth of the strongest opposition by theConservative Party. So was the Parliament Act of 1949, and that was forcedthrough by a Government which included nearly all the present leaders of theLabour Party, from Mr. Attlee downwards. They could therefore surely not putforward any very effective argument against our party following their own precedent.Were we, indeed, as a single party with a small majority, to try to put the clock rightback and give the House of Lords the powers which it had before 1911, that would justify serious criticism. But this is not, so far as I know, suggested in any quarter.All we have in mind, as 1 understand it, is to introduce a moderately conceivedmeasure, for three main purposes. First, we want to cut out the backwoodsmenpeers, who, by their absence, at present so seriously weaken the prestige of theHouse. Secondly, we want to facilitate the entry of men and possibly women who could make a valuable contribution to the work of the House, but who cannotsaddle their sons with the obligations and expense inseparable from a hereditarypeerage. By these means, we might hope to produce a reformed House of 250-300members. And, finally, we want possibly to increase the House&apos;s power of delay to that small extent that may be necessary to give the British people a real chance tomake up their minds on questions of importance that have not hitherto beensubmitted to them.3. These are surely very moderate aims, which would probably be notunpalatable to the majority of thinking men and women in all parties. I thereforehope that the Government will go ahead and consider schemes of reform, whatever the Labour Party reply to our invitation may have been.4. The exact form of the scheme to be finally adopted no doubt presents apretty difficult problem. There is no question on which there is so infinite a variety of possible permutations and combinations. Indeed, House of Lords Reform is a subject on which, apparently, no two people think exactly alike. In particular,there are the views of the Conservative Peers to be considered, and my impressionis that, now that we are in power, they will hot be nearly so easy to guide as theywere in 1948, especially over any limitation of the hereditary system; and this43941
sensitiveness will, I am afraid, have been increased by the decision howeverinevitable that decision may have been that peers must ballot for seats at the coronation. They are in a mood to resist all further encroachments on their rightsand privileges. We shall have to bear this in mind in selecting our scheme, or wemay get a violently hostile reaction from wide.sections of opinion in the House ofLords, which would not only kill the scheme itself but would show up their Lord-ships in a very unfavourable light. The different atmosphere now existing in theHouse might, for instance, have a serious effect on support for the plan on whichwe went into battle in 1948. That plan, as my colleagues will remember, envisagedtwo types of peer. There would be a comparatively small body of hereditary peerswho would sit by virtue of a dual qualification, e.g., that they were the holders of a united Kingdom peerage and were also Privy Counsellors. This select bandwould, in 1948, have amounted to about 100. The remainder of the House wouldbe composed of Life Peers of Parliament, who might be either hereditary peers notpossessing the dual qualification or distinguished commoners. The House wouldhave been completed by the addition of three Bishops and the Law Lords.5.   It is sometimes urged in favour of this plan that the proposal was acceptedby the Labour Representatives at the joint talks in 1948.  But that is in fact not so.  The recommendations were, in any case, ad referendum to the rank and file of the parties represented at the talks; so the leaders were in no position to cometo binding agreements.   Moreover, those who took part will recall that, beforeagreement could finally be achieved between the party leaders on the composition of the reformed House, the Labour Party insisted on switching the discussion overto the powers of the House, on which the talks broke down.  I had always had asuspicion that they did this because they felt that they had gone too far to meet us over the composition of the reformed House: and this was confirmed to me byLord Addison shortly before his death. Our 1948 plan would therefore presumablybe still quite unacceptable to the Labour Party; and it is likely to have a muchrougher passage now than in 1948 from the Conservative Peers. These never reallyliked our proposals.  They thought the dual qualification for hereditary peers was far too stiff a one, and would cut out many who at present do admirable work inthe House.  In particular and one must admit that this is a very real objectionto the plan it would be likely to exclude all the younger hereditary peers.  Yetthese play an essential part in the House as the younger Members of Parliamentdo in the House of Commons by carrying, especially in opposition, the mainburden of the Committee Stage of Bills, by putting down amendments or speakingon them, and so on. Such work as that will never be done by elderly Privy Counsel-lors or by the distinguished and equally elderly commoners, the heads of Colleges,the retired Ambassadors, the elder Statesmen of the Trades Union world, who maybe expected to be the recipients of life peerages.  For these reasons, we should,I feel, be unwise to tie ourselves to our 1948 plan, to which such serious shortcomingshave become apparent.6. But what are the alternatives? Out of the immense mass of schemes whichhave been put forward from time to time, it seems to me that there are two whichwould probably be acceptable to the House of Lords itself and should go a longway to achieve the purposes which we have in mind. The first is that the systemof representative hereditary peers, elected by their fellows, which has obtained forScotland ever since the Act of Union, should be extended to cover the UnitedKingdom peerage. The number of such peers would have to be laid down in theAct, and they could, like the Scottish representative peers, be balloted for by their fellow peers at the beginning of each Parliament. This would&apos;allow of a great deal more elasticity than our 1948 plan. The selected peers could be of any age, oldor young, and they would need no special qualifications except selection by their fellow peers. The hereditary peerage could choose anyone it wished to represent it,up to the number laid down in the Act. This should certainly make the limitationof numbers less distasteful to the Conservative Party in the House of Lords.7. I would suggest that the number of these representative hereditary peersmight be in the region of 100-150. The remainder of the House say another100-150 would consist of Life Peers, chosen from the Commonalty by some such machinery as was envisaged in our 1948 plan. It will be remembered that, under that scheme-to get the new House going-the names of Life Peers, were initiallyto be submitted to the King by the leaders of the three main parties, in proportion to the votes cast for those parties in the preceding General Election. As Life Peers
died or retired, their places were to be filled by the Prime Minister of the day.It was calculated that, over a period of years by the swing of the pendulum-thisshould work out quite fairly, at any rate as between the Conservative and LabourParties.8. Such, broadly speaking, is the first alternative which I would recommendfor my colleagues&apos; consideration. I am inclined to think that, as things are now,it is more likely to find acceptance than the 1948 scheme, and I have personallycome to like it the best, if only one could get over one very serious defect, to whicnI must confess that I have not yet found an answer. If the Peers, who are over-overwhelmingly Conservative in their politics, are to elect their own representatives, howare we to ensure that any hereditary Labour Peers are chosen at all? It would bea sad business if the only result of our reform, which had been intended to give amore even balance between the parties, was to exclude many of those who atpresent sit on the Labour Benches and indeed practically to eliminate Labourhereditary representation in the House altogether. Some way must clearly befound to get over this difficulty; but if that can be done, a scheme on these linesseems to me to have considerable advantages over any other.9. Various possible lines of approach to this difficulty have been suggested tome. The first is that every hereditary peer who is a Privy Counsellor should have aright to sit. This would be a very natural provision to put in and it would ensurethat every prominent member of the Labour Front Bench was automaticallyincluded. The second is that, to be eligible for election by his fellow peers, a peermust have qualified by attendance. This would bring into the picture nearly allthe Labour Peers and cut out nearly all the backwoodsmen. Third and last, itmight be laid down that out of the 100 or 150 votes for representative peerspossessed by each United Kingdom peer, only a proportion, say 7-5 per cent., shouldbe given to members of his own party. This should, on present figures at any rate,be perfectly effective in securing that the whole of the present Labour Party, withthe possible exception of one or two outstandingly unpopular men, was chosen.These various possibilities may be worth exploring.10. I feel, however, that I ought also to mention at any rate one other alternative scheme, in case my colleagues do not share my views as to the merits of the scheme outlined in the preceding paragraph. This, broadly speaking, is the proposal putforward by Lord Simon in nis recent bill which is still before the House of Lords that the hereditary membership of the House should remain untouched and should merely be supplemented by the creation of so many Life Peers a year. I do not personally like this proposal. It does nothing to eliminate the vast number ofbackwoodsmen peers, who at present are, in the eyes of the public, the greatestweakness of the House. These absentees never normally attend to their duties: inmany cases they have not even troubled to take the oath of allegiance. Yet theyretain a hereditary right to come up at any time and vote down some measure ofwhich they do not approve. They do not in fact nowadays exercise that right: Ibelieve they never will: but they could if they wished. That is something which itis impossible to defend, and I feel strongly that any scheme which we recommend to the country ought to contain provision for eliminating backwoodsmen. At thesame time, imperfect though the Simon plan is, no doubt the legalisation of thecreation of Life Peers would by itself strengthen the House, and it might beconsidered better than nothing.Finally, there is a proposal which has been put forward by a highly respectedConservative Peer, Lord Exeter. I feel that I must mention it, though I should saythat the Lord Chancellor and other Constitutional authorities take the view that itis ruled out, as it would involve an infringement of the Royal Prerogative. LordExeter is a lifelong student of the history of the House of Lords and he holds thaton former occasions, the House of Lords have limited their own powers to vote byan amendment of the Standing Orders of the House. He asks now why they shouldnot, by the same method, deal with the problem of the backwoodsmen. His pro-posal is that peers who have not attended a certain number of sittings of the Houseduring the preceding Parliament should be debarred from voting during the nextParliament. They could attend: they could even speak: but they could not vote.This proposal certainly would have had considerable charms. For it would havemeant that the House of Lords would eliminate the backwoodsmen altogetherwithout the matter being referred to the House of Commons at all, and in this way
they would, by their own action, remove one of the main reproaches against theirbody. In its present form, it is,- however, ruled out by the Lord Chancellor^authoritative opinion. But the same result might presumably be achieved by legis-lation, to which there would possibly not be the same objection, if the consent ofthe Crown had first been obtained.In any of these alternative schemes there might well also be some provision togive hereditary peers the right to decide whether they wished to sit in the House ofLords or the House of Commons. This decision would, however, I imagine, notbind their successors.I have tried, in this paper, to put before the Cabinet the broad lines of certainalternative schemes for the reform of the House of Lords. There are, I know, manyfurther alternatives which others may consider in some way preferable. But nearly all of them are elaborate, and if we once start on an elaborate scheme involving thecarefully balanced representation of this or that sphere of public life, I am quite sure that we shall never get agreement even in our own party. The greatest possiblesimplicity is the only hope. It is for that reason that I prefer the schemes to whichI have referred above.I have said nothing, in this paper, about the powers of the House of Lords.Personally, I should like the House&apos;s power of delay increased by three months,so as to ensure that, after a dispute has arisen between the two Houses, the british people should have a breathing space of at least six months to decide on the merits of the case. But it must be recognised that to increase the powers of the House,by however small an amount, is likely to have the effect of stimulating the LabourParty to reverse our legislation as soon as it comes into power. This is a matterabout which I should not wish to pontificate: but it is one which will have to beconsidered in due course.Both the composition and the powers of the House are indeed matters to be carefully weighed. I would suggest that, for this purpose, it may be found con-venient to appoint a committee of Ministers to go into the various alternative schemes of reform, as regards both composition and powers, and report back tothe Cabinet. This should be done as soon as possible, if the necessary legislation is to be introduced within the lifetime of this Parliament.S.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,23rd March, 1953.
