PRIME MINISTER TO MR. MENZIESWe have recently been reviewing our policy on Atomic Energy.    Look-ing forward over the next decade or so, it is clear we are on the threshold ofgreat developments.    In the military field the United Kingdom weapon programmenow stands on its own feet and is not dependent on American information.    Inthe industrial field, we do not think we have much to learn from the United States:we are now starting to build our first power reactor from which we shall get an appreciable quantity of electricity by 1957.In the course of this review, I have learnt of the telegrams which passed in 1951 about Anglo-Australian co-operation in atomic energy matters.    Had Idealt with these, my whole inclination would have been to send you a much moreforthcoming answer, for I am sure that our two countries ought to work closelytogether in this vital sphere.I gather that the difficulty which was held to bulk so large in 1951 wasthe terms of our arrangements with the United States which hamper us in work-ing with the Commonwealth.    We have tried and we shall go on trying toco-operate on atomic energy with the United States to the fullest extent open tous, but the attitude of Congress in this field is so rigid that we cannot count on being able to get really useful collaboration with them.    Aad in any case, I am not content that we should continue to acce pt terms which preclude our co-operating with Australia, as freely as we do with Canada under the tripartitearrangements.Now that we are launching out into the industrial field ourselves, thesuggestion for a joint programme of development which you made in 1951 can befruitfully pursued.    To this end, we are prepared to explain to the americans that circumstances have changed since we made our post-war arrangements withthem; and that we now feel we are justified in sharing with Australia and perhaps other members of the old Commonwealth secret information which is derived from our own research and experience - as the great bulk of our informa-tion is.We have also been looking at the long-term supply of uranium.    we intend that our joint purchasing arrangements with the Americans, about which you know, should continue;  but they only concern defence requirements.    Theseare now well covered and we think the time has come to consider futureindustrial needs, which may prove of the greatest importance to the economy of the United Kingdom as to that of Australia.    The Americans - with theirimmense hydro-electric,- coal and oil resources - are much less interested inthe industrial aspects.    Ought we not therefore now to consider whether weshould husband some part of available uranium resources for peaceful uses?If we could devise some arrangement for mutual co-operation between our two countries, which would reserve some portion of your untapped and un-contracted uranium for a future joint power programme, I think this might proveof inestimable benefit to both our countries.Before we broach anything of this to the Americans - and I would like to do this in the fairly near future - we would wish to know whether you think well inprinciple of this idea of a joint programme.    If so we should be glad to arrangefor our experts to follow it up with yours.    Perhaps the forthcoming visit of therepresentatives of your Atomic Energy Commission to this country would give an opportunity to begin a discussion of some of the aspects.
