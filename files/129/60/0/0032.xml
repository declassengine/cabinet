confidential the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I have been asked by NorthernIreland Ministers to agree to their introducing a subsidy on industrial coalconsumed in Northern Ireland and to this being announced by the Minister ofFinance, Northern Ireland, when he opens his Budget on 5th May.    The costof the subsidy, which is estimated at  750,000, would be borne directly by theNorthern Ireland Government, but would fall ultimately on the imperial exchequer through a reduction in the Imperial Contribution.    In addition to a coal subsidy, Northern Ireland Ministers have indicated that they will wish indue course to put before us a scheme for a subsidy on cross-channel freightto and from Northern Ireland.2.       The proposal for a coal subsidy is put forward against the background of the heavy unemployment which has persisted in Northern Ireland before and since the war.    The magnitude of this problem is indicated by the fact that thepresent rate of unemployment in Northern Ireland is 9 per cent, comparedwith about 2 per cent in Great Britain;  the actual numbers unemployed inNorthern Ireland in March of this year were 42,000, of whom over 60 per centhad been unemployed for more than 8 weeks.    The whole question of long-term unemployment in Northern Ireland was examined last year by a working party of officials of the two Governments, and in a Report (extracts from whichare annexed) submitted jointly to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Finance, Northern Ireland, the Working Party stated their viewthat &quot;a strong case can be made out for according to Northern Ireland special treatment beyond that accorded, on the basis of existing policy, to development areas generally&quot;.    The grounds on which this conclusion were based were set out in paragraphs 33-34 of the Report.3.        The Working Party examined in detail the various possible steps thatmight be taken to relieve unemployment in Northern Ireland, both in the shortrun and over a longer period, and in accordance with their recommendationscertain steps have already been taken in this direction.    In particular, theNorthern Ireland Government have stepped up their programme for social investment, and additional supplies of materials have been made available from the United Kingdom for food canning and processing in Northern Ireland,It was recognised by the Working Party, however, that no real impressioncould be made on the hard core of unemployment in Northern Ireland withoutthe creation of new industries there and the development of existing ones.The Working Party therefore examined the possibility of offering fresh induce-ments to attract more private enterprise to Northern Ireland, over and abovethe very generous assistance already offered by the Northern Ireland Govern-ment, which goes considerably beyond the assistance given in the development areas of Great Britain.C.(53) 13318TH APRIL, 1953CABINETMEASURES FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT INNORTHERN Ireland memorandum by the Home Secretary
9o4.       Four main types of inducement were considered:-(a) tax concessions to employers;(b) re-imbursement or remission, in wholeor in part, of employers&apos; unemploy-ment insurance contributions;(c) a freight subsidy;(d) a fuel subsidy.It was agreed that (a) must be ruled out because it violated the importantprinciple of parity of taxation which underlies the financial relationship betweenthe Imperial and Northern Ireland Governments.    The Working Party also took the view that there were conclusive objections to a freight subsidy, and that afuel subsidy would be scarcely less objectionable; the reasons for their taking this view are set out in paragraphs 86-92 of their Report.    Of the four types of assistance suggested, only (b) was considered worth pursuing, and theWorking Party recommended that the possibility of assistance on these lines should be examined further by officials.    This examination has since takenplace and it has revealed that there are a number of real difficulties to there mission by the Northern Ireland Government of employers&apos; insurance contributions; officials have not, however, yet been able to reach an agreedview on whether or not the idea of a scheme on these lines must be abandoned.5.       I think the point has now been reached when we ought to decide what we can do to help the Northern Ireland Government in their difficulties.    Inview of my special departmental responsibility for Northern Ireland I should like to see their wishes met.    I appreciate however the objections set outin the Working Party&apos;s Report to the proposed subsidies.    I can also appreciate the difficulties in the way of going ahead with a scheme for the remission ofemployers&apos; insurance contributions, but if my colleagues are unable to agreeto the coal subsidy I should like the remission of contribution given favourable consideration as perhaps the type of assistance which is best designed to meetNorthern Ireland&apos;s problem.6.       The expansion of employment there is held up by the high level ofindustrial costs;  the root of this problem is I am advised that wages in NorthernIreland are higher than can be justified on economic grounds.    The extension to northern Ireland of the growing strength of trade union organisation has broughta progressive narrowing of the gap between wages in Northern Ireland and wages in Great Britain, and this has removed the attraction which Northern Irelandonce had as a source of cheap labour - an advantage which helped to offset the disadvantages arising from high fuel and freight costs.    It may well be that toapply some sort of measure directly in relief of the cost of the employment oflabour in Northern Ireland by the remission of employers1 insurance contribu-tions would help to restore that advantage.7.       If the view is taken by my colleagues that the difficulties in the way ofthis or any other measure for making labour cheaper in Northern Ireland areinsuperable, I think we ought to consider whether there is any help which we can give to Northern Ireland by means of short term measures of relief, such as additional Government spending.    The possibilities are touched on in theWorking Party&apos;s Report, which suggests that something could be done on theselines if the Imperial Government were prepared to foot the bill.D.M.F.Home Office, S.W.I.18TH APRIL, 1953
ANNEXX X X X X X X33.      In the nature of things a decision on such a matter must be governed by social and political as well as economic considerations, andwe believe that the most compelling argument for according special treatment to Northern Ireland is to be found in the historical fact thatthirty years ago the Six Counties chose io stand by Great Britain ratherthan throw in their lot with the South.    The value of this association to britain herself was never more clearly demonstrated than during therecent war when the possession of vital bases in Northern Ireland provedof incalculable advantage to the Allied cause - and the denial of similarbases in the South a cruel handicap.    It is in the interests of GreatBritain no less than of Northern Ireland that the Union between the twocountries should be preserved, and in our view this imposes upon theUnited Kingdom Government a special responsibility for seeing that steps are taken both to make good the arrears of social and economic development in Northern Ireland to which we have already referred andto mitigate the economic disadvantages which Northern Ireland suffersas a result of its geographical separation from the rest of the UnitedKingdom.34.      In this connection we would like to emphasise the inescapablefact that both before and since the war the percentage of unemploymentin Northern Ireland has been persistently higher than that of almost anyother Region of the United Kingdom and something like twice as high asthe average for the whole of Great Britain. (1)   Northern Ireland, more-over, is the only area in the United Kingdom where there has continuedsince the war to be much more serious unemployment amongst men thanamongst women.    The present recession in the textile and clothingindustries has somewhat altered this picture, and in common withLancashire, Yorkshire and certain other textile areas Northern ireland has experienced a sharp rise in female unemployment during the pasttwelve months.    This is not, however, a normal situation, and there are good reasons for expecting at any rate a moderate revival of activity inthe textile and clothing industries generally.    In comparing the long-termunemployment problem of Northern Ireland with that of other areas it isin our view more realistic to consider the position as it was before the textile recession set in, and if this is done, it is clear that there is amuch more serious hard core of unemployment in Northern Ireland thanin any other region of the United Kingdom - and this in spite of the factthat the assistance offered to new industrial undertakings by the Govern-ment of Northern Ireland under the New Industries (Development) Acts of1932, 1937 and 1945 has been more generous than anything offered in theDevelopment Areas of Great Britain.(1)  It should be noted in this connection that the &quot;textile belt&quot; of lancashire, which has about twice the insured population of NorthernIreland, had in May, 1952 an unemployment rate of 11. 2 per cent comparedwith 11. 0 per cent in Northern Ireland at the same date.   But the rise in umemployment in Lancashire is very recent and most of the unemployedare temporarily stopped.    This cannot therefore be regarded as apersistent problem comparable with that of Northern Ireland.    Therehas been persistently heavy unemployment on the North-East coast ofScotland, which has had a higher monthly average of unemployment thanNorthern Ireland during the six years 1946 to 1951, but the situation here is a quite exceptional one, being associated with one highly seasonalindustry, (fishing).    The North-East coast of Scotland moreover is avery much smaller area than Northern Ireland, having an insured popula-tion of only 23,000.
X X X X X X86.   (a)    Tax Remission.    Income tax, profits tax and E.P.L. are all&quot;reserved&quot; taxes, and any special remission in favour of business inNorthern Ireland would infringe the important principle of parity of taxationbetween the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.    We do not think thatthis principle should be lightly discarded.    Moreover, action on these lines would certainly give rise to claims for similar concessions from other regions.    If there is a case for tax concessions at all - and we do not recommend them - it might be simpler to seek a solution in the remission of local rates, with the Local Authorities being reimbursed by the Govern-ment of Northern Ireland.    Something of this kind is already done underthe 1945 Act, which empowers Local Authorities to give to certain factoriescomplete exemption from local rates for a maximum of ten years.87.    (b) Reimbursement of Employers&apos; National Insurance Contributions.The concession might take the form of using a given&quot;sum to refund part orwhole of employers&apos; contributions over the whole economy or concentratingit on relief to the industrial sector, : To. confine the concession to new industry would not provide any incentive to increase or maintain employ-ment in firms already established, and to limit it to increases over employ-ment at a base date would&apos; raise difficult problems,88. The obvious advantage of such a scheme is that the assistance would be directly related to labour costs and would therefore tend toencourage industries which use relatively large amounts of labour inrelation to capital.    To encourage the use of labour in this manner may appear inconsistent with the efforts being made to increase productivity,but the apparent paradox is a reflection of the existence of unused labourwhen maximum production is needed.    A disadvantage of the reimbursementin whole or part of employers&apos; contributions, however disguised, is that itwould provoke demands for similar reimbursement of workers&apos; contributions j,or for increases in pay.    Demands for an equivalent reduction in workers&apos;contributions might derive strength from the fact that the National InsuranceAct, in giving the Treasury power to vary contributions by Orrder forpurposes of employment policy, stipulated that workers&apos; and employers&apos;contributions must be altered by equal amounts.    Reimbursements of workers&apos;contributions would stimulate consumer demand in Northern Ireland, but itwould also have the effect of encouraging a flow of labour into NorthernIreland and so rendering the problem of Northern Ireland employment moreintractable.    We have, therefore confined this scheme to employers1 contribu-tions, and we think that, in spite of possible trade union opposition on this score, a scheme&apos;so limited is worth further examination, with proper regardto the difficulties which the Northern Ireland Government would have&apos;inadministering it and in confining its field of operation.89.     (c) Freight Subsidy.    The Northern Ireland Government has emphasised the need for reorganisation of the cross-Channel transport services and has expressed the view that such reorganisation, &quot;whethercarried out under public or private ownership, would involve some formof subvention from public funds if cross-Channel transport costs are to bereduced sufficiently to enable Northern Ireland industry to reach thevolume of investment necessary to achieve and maintain a high level ofemployment11.    The Ministry of Transport are, however, strongly opposedto a freight subsidy and they have put forward the following arguments against it:-
(i)   It is directly contrary to the policy of the UnitedKingdom as a mercantile nation to subsidise itsshipping, and the Governments aim is to eliminatesubsidies (save in quite exceptional circumstances)except when clearly justifiable for defence purposes. (1)For the United Kingdom to introduce a subsidy where nosuch defence justification applies would weaken itsstand on principle in combating subsidisation by othercountries.    Experience has also shown that subsidiesgo hand in hand with discrimination.    Thus any departure from this country&apos;s general policy hasimplications damaging to its world-wide mercantileinterests.(ii)   A freight subsidy for Northern Ireland would intensifydemands for the same treatment from other ares which consider that they are handicapped by hightransport costs, e. g. , the Orkneys and Shetlands andcertain Development Areas.    Such requests would notbe confined to shipping, but would doubtless spread toinland transport.    The logical outcome of this wouldbe to sever transport charges from costs, and this is contrary to the Governments policy.(iii)   A general freight subsidy would be indiscriminate andwould for some industries be ineffective and for otherindustries unnecessary.    It might also lead to thewasteful use of transport and be open to serious abuse.(iv) A freight subsidy would mainly benefit the wrong type ofindustry, i. e., firms whose transport costs are high inrelation to total costs of production.These objections are in our view conclusive.90.   (d)    Fuel Subsidy.   All but the first of the above objections to ageneral freight subsidy would apply equally to a subsidy related directly to the transport of coal, such as has also been suggested by the NorthernIreland Government.    Moreover, the National Coal Board is specificallydebarred by Parliament from offering &quot;undue preference&quot; to anyparticular class of consumers.    There is a common schedule of pit-headprices, and the prices charged to the consumer are based on these prices,plus a charge to cover cost of transport.    Northern Ireland is treated asan inland market on the same basis as other parts of the United Kingdom,and although coal prices in Northern Ireland are above the average forGreat Britain, they are exceeded in particular areas even furtherremoved from the coalfields (e. g., Cornwall).    Any attempt to fixuniform prices for the United Kingdom would involve a complete reversal of the Governmenfs policy of relating transport charges more closely to prices.(1)  The only exception to the general policy is the MacBrayne subsidy madeto shipping and road services in the &quot;Western Highlands and Islands.    Thissubsidy has existed since before 1891 and is an instrument of social policy.The facts here are quite different from those in Northern Ireland.    With a population of something under a quarter of a million dispersed over a large area, it is impossible to run a transport system which will pay for itself,and the subsidy (the justification for which is a matter for the Scottish home department) prevents the de-population of the Highlands and Islands whichmight otherwise follow.    It should be noted that the subsidy enables only abare minimum of services to be provided.
91. It was suggested that these difficulties might be overcome if a subsidy could be applied in Northern Ireland itself with the object of reducingthe price of coal to industrial consumers, and a scheme on these lines(involving a subsidy of 30s. a ton at an annual cost of  1. 5 million) has been worked out by the Government of Northern Ireland.    The Ministry of fuel and Power have pointed out the following objections to the scheme:-(i)   Demands for the same treatment will be encouraged -(a) from other areas of the United Kingdom(North of Scotland, Southern England)where coal costs are comparable becauseof similar freight charges; and(b) if the subsidy is of the order of 30s. a ton -from all industrial areas in Great Britain,even the Development Areas and other districts near the coal fields.(ii)   The scheme would encourage the advocates of the&quot;postalisation&quot; of coal prices.(iii)    It would benefit most those industries whose fuel costsform a high proportion of their total cost of production,i. e. , industries naturally unsuited to a country likeNorthern Ireland with little indigenous fuel.(iv)   The benefit to the industries best suited to NorthernIreland would be small, even from a high rate of subsidy, and would seem unlikely to have any appreciable effect on employment.Having regard to these objections, we do not feel able to recommend a solutionbeing sought on these lines.92. One other aspect of fuel pricing policy may be mentioned here.Northern Ireland, along with other industrial areas situated some distance from the oil terminals (e. g., the Midlands), is classified as a &quot;General Zone&quot;by the oil companies for the purposes of fixing prices.    Maximum permittedselling prices in a &quot;General Zone&quot; are jd. per gallon more than in an &quot;OuterZone&quot; and Id. per gallon more than in an &quot;Inner Zone&quot;, the differential being based on the relative costs of transport.    The Ministry of Fuel and Power aresatisfied, from informal talks that they have had with the oil companies, thatthis differential is justified in the case of Northern Ireland, though in fact thecompanies are at present selling heavy fuel oil in Northern Ireland at-d. per gallon below the maximum price permitted.x       x       xx       x       x
