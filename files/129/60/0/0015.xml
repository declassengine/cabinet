(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S -GOVERNMENT)confidential. (53) 11527th MARCH, 1953.CABINETGRANTS FOR LIBERAL ADULT education memorandum by the Minister of EducationMy earlier paper C. (53) 57 described the arrangements underwhich my Department pays grants to certain non-official Responsible bodies which conduct classes in liberal adult education.   At their meeting on10th March (C.C.(53) 18th Conclusions, Minute 3) the Cabinet agreed toconsider the grants to be made to these Bodies in the coming year when had completed my examination of certain further information for whichI had asked.   I had in particular asked them to tell me more aboutthe cost of meeting salary increments for their full-time tutors and about their fee arrangements.2. They have now told me that for all the Bodies together thecost of meeting salary increments would, they think, be about  8,000 to 10,000 in the coming year, if all their 260 full-time tutors are to remainin post.   As my Departments grants are normally paid at the rate of75 per cent of the cost of tutor&apos;s remuneration this by itself would meanan increase of at least  6,000 in the amount of my grant.COPY NO. 3 H3. On fees, the information now given me confirms my viewthat the sums paid by students attending these classes are on an averageunduly low.   While in some areas recent increases have brought them up to a reasonable level, in many they are still well below those charged by Local Education Authorities for similar classes, and in some areasthey are little more than nominal.   I regard this as quite wrong, whetherfrom the point of view of the taxpayer or of the students.   In myexperience, when a reasonable fee is fixed for any service provided foradult students, this helps them to put a proper value on it.4. In fact the taxpayer&apos;s contribution to this service has grownout of all proportion to that of the student.   According to figures supplied to my Department by the Bodies themselves, the total income from students&apos;fees for all the Bodies together is only some  15,000 to  20,000 a year.As there are about 150,000 students attending courses, this means on anaverage a little over 2/- per student per course.   But, in addition to the grants they receive from my Department, which in 1952=53 were about 340,000, these Bodies also receive grants from two other public sources.Both the extra-mural departments of the Universities and the Workers&apos;Education Association receive grants from Local Education Authorities,,which in 1952-53 amounted to about  75,000; and the extra- muraldepartments also spend on this work some  200,000 from general universityfunds which is in large part derived from the Treasury through theUniversity Grants Committee.   Not all this  200,000 was used to financeclasses of the particular type with which I am concerned, but even so I
am bound to conclude that these classes are receiving not far short of 600,000 from public sources or some  4 per student per course, ascompared with an average studenfs contribution of 2/-.5. I have come to the conclusion that - as these figures themselvessuggest - the arrangements for assisting this service from public funds are altogether too complicated and unsuited for ensuring proper supervision of expenditure, and I propose to secure the agreement of the ResponsibleBodies to the setting up of a small committee to enquire into this matterand to make recommendations on the best method of administering and financing this work in future years.6. Meanwhile, for the educational year 1953-54 only, I proposeto proceed as follows.   I should ask all the Responsible Bodies to adoptfees of at least 12/6d for a &quot;sessional&quot; course of 20 to 24 lectures,with corresponding fees for shorter courses, i. e. roughly 6d. a lecture,I should leave myself free to consider claims for exceptional treatmentfrom particular bodies or areas;  and to meet the argument that somestudents such as old-age pensioners cannot pay the proposed fees, Ishould ask the Responsible Bodies to make suitable arrangements forremitting or reducing fees in such special cases.7. If fees on these lines are not fixed for any classes, thenI would not pay grant in respect of them.   I propose to make this a strictcondition but not to limit my grant to any fixed sum.   On the contraryI would tell the Responsible Bodies that I propose to stick to the formulain the present Grant Regulations and so far as approved classes areconcerned to pay grant at 75 per cent of the expenditure on the salaries of their existing establishments of full-time tutors, (including expenditureon salary increments as mentioned in paragraph 2), and on the remuneration of part-time tutors up to the same number which I have agreed to aid inthe current educational year for each of the Bodies concerned,8. I cannot say what would be the exact financial result ofsuch a proposal.   It would depend on whether all the Responsible Bodieswere willing to submit satisfactory fee proposals and whether theintroduction of increased fees led to the a andonment of any classesbecause the students were not keen enough to pay fees at the new rates.Allowing for the effect of the salary increments mentioned in paragraph 2,I estimate that my total grant would work out roughly at the same amount as this year.9, I therefore ask approval for putting the proposals inparagraphs 5, 6 and 7 to the organisations concerned.F. H.Ministry of Education, W. 1.27th March, 1953.
