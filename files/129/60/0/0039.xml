(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(53) 140 COPY NO,24th APRIL, 1953.CABINETREGIONAL organisation memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local GovernmentI cannot agree to any weakening of our regional organisation at thepresent time - other than the closing of our Tunbridge Wells Office, which Ihave accepted.2.      Most of the day-to-day work on housing is done in the regional offices.To disturb them at this moment, just when we are within sight of the target,would be fatal,3,       The housing programme still largely depends on the local authorities;and their extraordinary success in building or getting built whatever number ofhouses the Government of the day has decided to go for, is due to the work ofthe regional staff.   Sometimes we need to quicken the pace;   sometimes we need to slow it.   This cannot be done by letters.   It needs the most discreethandling;  many authorities, after all, are politically opposed to us.4,        We are hoping for 300,000 houses this year.   But it is going to be touch-and-go on the materials.   We are having to urge on authorities every possibleeconomy in the use of bricks;  we may have to do this with other materials.The authorities don&apos;t like it;  but as a result of persuasion by the regionalstaff most of them are co-operating.   Unless we can get the economies, weshan&apos;t get the houses.   We can only get them by constant following up.   Lettersare worse than useless.5.       It is true that much of the Cambridge region is as near, or nearer,to London as it is to Cambridge,   So is some of the Reading region.   But manyof the authorities in /olved are a long way off.   In any event the psychological effect on the authorities of closing the offices just as we are entering on what may be the last lap would be disastrous.   They would think that the race was over.6.        Perhaps when we reach the point at which the Government is more orless indifferent to the number of houses built each year, or at any rate isprepared to leave new houses mainly to private enterprise, my Department couldclose its Cambridge and Reading regional offices.   Maybe we will then be ableto fold up all our regional offices.7,       But when that time comes, I hope to fold up too,8,        Meanwhile, please leave us alone.   We are doing no harm, and perhapsare doing some good.H.M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government.S.W.I.24th April, 1953.
