hi(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(53) 117 COPY NO. &quot;&apos;Jo-30TH MARCH, 1953CABINETAMNESTY FOR DESERTERSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council a Committee under my Chairmanship was appointed by the Cabinetto consider,   with the Service Ministers, how best to deal with the erroneousclaims described in the memorandum by the Minister of Defence (C. (53) 106)and also to consider whether the amnesty should extend to two classes of casesmentioned by the Prime Minister in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 24th March(C.C.(53) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 3).2.       Of the three possible ways of treating men who have reported them-selves in error, suggested in C. (53) 106, none is completely satisfactory.The first method - that of arresting and trying them - is open to the serious objection that it would undoubtedly be repugnant to British public opinion toseem to take advantage of men who had made a genuine error.    The secondmethod - that of ignoring the confessions - was also found to be unacceptablein that it would leave the men concerned open to arrest and prosecution andwould moreover lead to difficult anomalies in practice, in particular withregard to other offences they might have committed.    We therefore came to the conclusion that the least unsatisfactory course would be to adopt thethird method of asking men to sign a confession of desertion, but with thevariant described below. &apos;3.       We were impressed by the consideration that the amnesty had been announced in a spirit of generosity, and that it would be a pity to mar this byseeming to take advantage of men who might have been led astray by a genuine misunderstanding of its terms.    But if the benefit of the doubt wereto be given to those who had applied erroneously for the amnesty, a definitedate, before Parliament rioas for the Easter Recess, should be announced,after which no claims out of time would be entertained.    A clear warningwould have to be given that men who reported erroneously after that date -would be liable to arrest and prosecution.4,        The measures we recommend are as follows:-(a) Deserters who have reported themselves to the service authorities before the time of the announcement but whoare outside the terms of the amnesty would be informed inwriting by the Service authorities that they should sign aconfession of desertion;  in this event trial would be dispensed with (by an Order under Section 73 of the Armyand Air Force Act, or by administrative direction in theNaval Service) and no further proceedings would be taken against them.
(b) Those who have a liability under the National service act, 1948 for whole-time National Service would berequired to complete their period of service.(c) In all other cases men would be placed at once on the Z orother appropriate unpaid Reserve.    Suitable certificateswould be issued stating that this had been done.(d) Men would also be informed that&apos; if they failed to follow this procedure they would be liable to be arrest and triedfor desertion.(e) This procedure would apply equally to men who had reported from the Republic of Ireland.-fesfc*a*gh*^ifk^t&quot;&amp;il iett(f) A statement should be made, preferably by the Prime Minister,before Parliament rises for the Easter recess, setting outthe steps which it has been decided to take, and making itclear that no further erroneous claims would be entertained.A draft of a statement to give effect to this recommendation is attached.5.       The Home Secretary is consulting the police and other prosecutingauthorities in the hope that they will be willing to refrain from prosecutionfor &quot;consequential&quot;offences, save in exceptional circumstances, as theyhave agreed to do for men who were covered by the amnesty announced on23rd February.6. If our proposals are approved, men in the categories mentioned bythe Prime Minister would be dealt with as follows(a) Men who had served well in the war, but had deserted after-wards, would be covered by the new arrangements only ifthey had reported themselves in writing before the time ofthe new announcement we propose.    If any men in this category surrendered or were apprehended subsequently,they would have to face trial by court-martial or summarily.Their war record would, however, be taken into account when deciding on any punishment.(b) Save for a few pre-war Naval deserters, who have been dealtwith under normal Admiralty practice (which does not involve punishment^ no case has come to light of a pre-wardeserter who has served subsequently and claimed thebenefit of the amnesty in error.    Any of these would, ifapprehended, be dealt with on their merits and their warrecords would be taken into account in deciding on theirpunishment.7.        We invite the Cabinet to approve our conclusions and to authorise a statement to be made in the House of Commons before the Easter Recessin the terms of the annex.Privy Council Office, S.W.1.30TH MARCH, 1953.
annex draft STATEMENT BY THE PRIME minister with your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I should like to make a further statement about deserters applying for the benefit ofthe Coronation amnesty.2.        In the statement on this subject which I made in this House on23rd February last I said that there would be no more prosecutions fordesertion of members of the Armed Forces who had deserted from theServices between 3rd September, 1939 and 15th August, 1945: that is to say,from the outbreak of war with Germany until the end of hostilities with Japan,3.        In spite of that statement, which received wide publicity at the time,&apos;between 300 and 400 men (many of them from the Republic of Ireland) havemistakenly claimed the benefit of the amnesty in the belief that they were entitled to the concession.    This belief may well have arisen from a genuinemisunderstanding based on faulty or incomplete versions of my statement which they may have heard or read.4.       Her Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered how thesemistaken claims should be dealt with and have decided on the following steps .5.       Army and Air Force deserters who have already reported up toto-day&apos;s date that they have been deserters from the Armed Forces will berequired to sign a confession of desertion in the prescribed form; anOrder under Section 73 of the Army and Air Force Act will then be madedispensing with trial by court martial.    Corresponding treatment will begiven to Naval deserters in a similar position.6.       Amongst those who have confessed their desertion in the belief that they were covered by the amnesty are a limited number of men witha liability for service under the 1948 National Service Act.    Such men willbe required to complete their period of whole-time national service.    Allother categories will be transferred to the appropriate unpaid Reserve andwill be given suitable certificates.7.        Written instructions in the sense of this decision will be sent to individual applicants by the Service authorities.    Applicants will be warned that, unless they comply with the instructions, they remain liable toprosecution for desertion.8.        After to-day men in civil life who claim the benefit of the amnesty, but who deserted before 3rd Seiotember, 1939 or after15th August, 1945, will remain liable to arrest and prosecution fordesertion.9.       As regards Consequential&quot; offences in relation to falsedocuments, etc., on which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary madea statement on 17th March, I am in a position to say that the responsibleauthorities mentioned in that statement have informed the Governmentthat, save in exceptional circumstances, it is not their intention to prosecutewhere a mistaken claim has been made up to the time of this statement.From to-day on men who report themselves for desertion outside the war-time period will be liable to prosecution for the &quot;consequential&quot; offencesalso.
6o10.       My hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury has mentioned thepossibility of a claim being made by men who deserted before3rd September, 1939, but who subsequently served under an assumed nameduring the war.    No claim of this kind has yet emerged;  but it would clearly not be covered by the terms of the amnesty.    If, however, aconfession of guilt were to be received from any man in this position,I can give an assurance that it would be considered on its merits andthe fact that the man had given satisfactory service in the Armed Forcesafter his pre-war desertion would certainly be taken into consideration in deciding on his treatment.
