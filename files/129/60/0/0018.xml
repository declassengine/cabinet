THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1953CONFIDENTIAL Copy No..    6^C. (53) 11831 st March, 1953CABINETPROPOSED  APPEAL  FOR  THE  SURRENDER  OF  FIREARMSMemorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor scotland we invite the Cabinet to approve a proposal that there should be an appealto the public during a four-week period in April-May to surrender to. the policefirearms and ammunition, on the understanding that no proceedings would betaken for any breach of the law relating to firearms that might be disclosed.2. There have been four occasions in recent times on which a similar appealhas been made, with the following results:  SurrenderedRounds of ShellsFirearms     Ammunition       Grenades, &amp;c.1.   May 1933 ...... 16,409 25,8912. April 1935         ... 8,469 151,657 3793. August 1937      ... 13,855 144.148 1,0524. March 1946       ... 75,966 2,207,751 5,8733. The exact figures of the number of firearms lawfully held at present arenot available, but the position is probably not very different from what it was in1946, when some 286,000 certified firearms were held by some 196,000 persons.The firearms included 168,000 rifles and 98,000 revolvers or pistols. Most of thesefirearms are held for sporting purposes. Some are held, without ammunition, as war trophies or for sentimental reasons. Some are held for the purpose of personalprotection, but they are few.4. A further appeal now would not be likely to yield the spectacular results which were secured in the special circumstances of 1946, but chief officers ofpolice who have been consulted take the view that there are still many illegally-heldfirearms and that it is likely that large numbers would be surrendered. Criminalswould not be likely to surrender weapons in their possession, but there are thefollowing considerations in favour of the proposal:  (i) It would not affect the well-disposed citizen who has a firearmscertificate.(ii) There has been criticism that the authorities are indifferent to the presentcrime wave and are not using the present favourable psychologicalsituation for withdrawing from circulation as many firearms as possible.(iii) Well-disposed citizens who may by chance have come into illegal possessionof firearms would be able to give them up with an easy conscience.(iv) As we have said, the police think that there are still many firearms illegallyheld in this country and that large numbers would be surrendered.(v) Weapons illegally held by well-disposed citizens may always be stolen orotherwise get into the hands of persons with criminal intentions. Theboy Craig, who murdered P.C. Miles at Croydon, had acquired varying43984
31st March, 1953.quantities of fourteen different types of ammunition which he had hiddenunder floor boards at his home; there is no doubt that criminals can at present acquire ammunition, and firearms, on a considerable scale,(vi) The appeal could be presented as a corollary to the Prevention of CrimeBill now before Parliament.5. It would take some little time to make the necessary preparations for anappeal on the lines suggested. We seek approval of the proposal for such an appealand of the setting in train of the necessary preparations. We should take carethat any announcement was framed so as not to contravene the Bill of Rights.D. M. F.J. S.
