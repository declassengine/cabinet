Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1953.SECRET Copy No. 7 2C. (53) 13723rd April, 1953.CABINETJAPAN AND THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND trade memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIntroductoryI wish to take the opinion of my colleagues on certain problems arising from japan&apos;s application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.).These problems involve important issues of economic and commercial policy. i must warn my colleagues that they are also capable of arousing intense political controversy. It may be convenient if I set out straight away the main problems with which the Japanese application confronts us.2. For us, the problem of Japanese competition has two principal aspects:first the action we could take in the United Kingdom itself to protect our own industries or (through Colonial Governments) in the Colonies to protect ourtrading interests in those markets, and second the effect on our export trade ofaction which other countries, including the independent members of the Common-wealth, might take to protect their domestic interests.3. By assuming the obligations of the G.A.T.T. towards Japan without anyspecial safeguards, countries become obliged to extend to her the same treatment in regard to tariffs as they extend to any other foreign countries. This means ingeneral that any country seeking to protect itself against Japanese competition by raising a protective tariff would have to raise it against everybody else. We, giventhe freedom we seek on the no-new-preference rule, would be able to raise duties on Japanese goods without impairing Commonwealth free entry, but we wouldbe compelled to make corresponding increases on imports from all other foreignsources. Other Commonwealth countries, including those Colonial territories which are free to raise tariffs, would meed, whenever they increased duties on japanese and other foreign trade, to make corresponding increases against our trade.4. Nor would our difficulties end with tariffs. We and other countries,including members of the Commonwealth, are at present free to use quotas against japan upon a discriminatory basis. Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, theUnited Kingdom and the Colonies are all discriminating in this way at the presenttime. The effect of Japan&apos;s entry into the G.A.T.T. upon this state of affairs is open to considerable technical argument; but it. seems reasonably clear that suchdiscrimination would certainly be open to challenge, would probably be againstthe spirit of such an accession and might well be held to be contrary to the rules.5. The danger we face in Japan&apos;s accession is not simply that she would secure rights of immediate or potential value to her in developing her export sales in competition with ourselves. We must face increased competition from Japanwhether she accedes to the G.A.T.T. or not, though we should hesitate before weadd to its extent. What is of even more consequence is firstly that we shouldseverely limit the ultimate freedom we now enjoy to protect our commercial interests in the United Kingdom market itself, and in our Colonial territories, and secondly that other countries, including the overseas Commonwealth, in seeking to protect themselves against the inflow of cheap Japanese goods, might raise
2their tariffs to prohibitive levels such as would cause serious and lasting damage to our exporting interests. Even worse harm might be done if any countries appliedquotas against Japan and felt obliged by the rules of the G.A.T.T. to extend themto our trade. These facts are well known throughout British industry in general,and in Lancashire in particular. The need for caution in our approach to these problems need hardly be emphasised.6. It must, of course, also be remembered that our declared aim is towork towards convertible currencies and multilateral trade. It was with this object in view that Ministers recently visited Washington. In the period which mustintervene between this visit and a decision by the Americans about their futurecommercial policy, we clearly should not take action contrary to the general line we have adopted in recent discussions. The policies we pursue in this period shouldbe consistent with our objectives. What is much more doubtful is whether weshould choose in the near future to assume new obligations.Recent History. 7. When Japan first applied to accede in July last year, we were able, in association with Australia and New Zealand, to secure that consideration of theapplication should be deferred to the Seventh Session of the Contracting parties in October.8. At that October Session, we called attention to the special problems which,in the absence of adequate safeguards, could be presented by a repetition of thedifficulties created by Japanese competition before the war; and, though a majorityof the Contracting Parties, including the United States, were either actively infavour of Japanese accession at an early date, or at least not disposed to oppose it,we were nevertheless able to secure agreement that an Intersessional Committeeshould examine and report on the conditions and timing under which the Japaneseapplication should be pursued.9. The Intersessional Committee met at the beginning of February, and theirreport on the safeguards which might be devised against a recurrence of the violentand. disruptive competition experienced from Japan before the war has now beensubmitted to the Governments of the Contracting Parties.Future Time-table10. The next step is for the Contracting Parties to meet to reach conclusions on the report of the Intersessional Committee and to decide on the nature and timing of the tariff negotiations to be conducted with Japan as a preliminary toher accession. The Intersessional Committee envisaged a special meeting of the contracting Parties in the summer. If by then the United States administration has secured the Congressional renewal of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act,on which their ability to negotiate tariffs with Japan depends, we have to reckonwith the possibility of this matter coming before a Special Session of the ContractingParties in July; otherwise it would come up at the next regular Session in September.Possible Safeguards11. I attach, as an Annex, a detailed analysis of the various suggestions forsafeguards considered by the Intersessional Committee and of their practical implications. Briefly, our objective was to secure provision for countries to enjoyunilateral freedom to discriminate against violent and disruptive competition. Thesuggestion we put forward for securing this by an extension of Article XIX ofthe G.A.T.T. would have been politically defensible at home, but was opposed by the Americans and others for a variety of reasons, which admittedly have considerable force. The suggestion which emerged as most likely to command ,general acceptance was one based on Article XXIII under which freedom to takediscriminatory action against Japanese competition would depend on a majority-decision of the Contracting Parties at the time, subject only to the right, in emergency conditions, to take action against Japan provisionally if the Contracting
/0 3,Parties did not reach a decision within thirty days of the matter being referred tothem. This provisional action would have to be discontinued if subsequentlydisapproved by the Contracting Parties.12. Though the details are technical, the essence of this proposal isdistressingly simple.   It has three considerable snags:  (a) That countries cannot in general take effective action without referenceto the G.A.T.T.(b) That they cannot continue action unless the G.A.T.T. approves it.(c) That we cannot be certain of the proposal being generally accepted in a form which would permit us to consider other people&apos;s trade or other people to consider ours.13. It would clearly be very far from easy to convince Parliament and industryhere of the value of a procedure which left freedom to deal effectively&apos; with japanese competition so largely dependent on the judgment of other countries, whose interest might often not coincide with ours. Under the Peace Treaty, Japan is until 1956obliged to give most-favoured-nation treatment to us, so long as we accord hermost-favoured-nation treatment, but we are not obliged to give her this treatment.It is by comparison with the ultimate freedom of action we now enjoy thatassumption of the obligations of the G.A.T.T. towards Japan would have to be defended to critics in the House and both sides of industry.14. Moreover, we must consider how we should stand, under this procedure,in,a situation in which competition for world markets was fierce, and unemploymentin difficult areas, such as for example the weaving belt of Lancashire, was mounting.Whatever other reasons might, in practice, hamper speedy action, the fact that wehad placed effective freedom to act outside the realm of Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s decision could, to say the least of it, put us in a politically difficult position. I wish to emphasise that these difficulties are not academic or far removed from thepresent political scene. It is not simply that criticism would come from bothsides of the House when the decision was announced. We should also have to answer this criticism in debate when it became necessary to seek the legislativepower we should need to raise discriminatory tariffs against Japan.15. My conclusion is that the Article XXIII procedure suggested by theIntersessional Committee, however much it may be commended upon the broadlines of the advance to multilateralism, both involves very real risks to our exporttrade and is fraught with such serious dangers politically that we should reject it.16. I have considered whether we might, by a high-level approach to the americans, try to enlist their support for some improvement in this procedure, atleast to the extent of giving us and other countries freedom to act subject only toan obligation to withdraw or modify the action if it were subsequently disapprovedby a majority of the Contracting Parties. The view of our Delegation to the Inter-sessional Committee is that it is most unlikely that we could succeed in getting the Americans and other countries to agree to this. I am, moreover, a little doubtfulof the wisdom of seeking an amendment of the rules which could so easily beused by others against us. Anyway, I consider that nothing short of full unchal-lengeable freedom (such as would have been secured by our proposal for writinginto the protocol of accession an escape clause applicable only against Japan),would go any substantial way to meet the difficulties to which I have referred.&apos; Inmy view, there is no possibility whatever of getting the Contracting Parties to agreeto this.The American Position17. The United States Government has all along been anxious to see Japanadmitted to the G.A.T.T. on equal terms and with as little delay as possible. they now aim to secure renewal of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act for a yearwhile they review their commercial policies generally. This decision almost certainly delays by at least twelve months any further round of general tariff negotiations. The American attitude is not one which we can forecast with certainty, but it is difficult to see how they could be ready to enter into tariff negotiations with the Japanese at an early date. They seem likely to find them-selves wishing to help the Japanese to enter the G.A.T.T. as quickly as possible,but inhibited by their own internal difficulties from doing so.   In this situation it
seems reasonably certain that the Americans will seek to reassure the Japanese by securing for them at least a decision in principle that they shall be accepted as members of the G.A.T.T. as soon as tariff negotiations can be arranged, eventhough this may be at a fairly distant date in the&apos;future. We must, therefore,reckon that in September, if not at a special session of the Contracting Parties inJuly, the Japanese question will be put to a vote and we shall have to define ourposition.Article XXXV18. Under Article XXXV, any country may declare, at the time of Japan&apos;saccession, that it does not accept the obligations and renounces the rights of theG.A.T.T. towards Japan; this does not mean that such a country would not inpractice extend normal G.A.T.T. treatment to Japan, but that it would not commititself to do so, hence reserving the right to discriminate against Japan if ever thatbecame in its judgment necessary. There is this at least to be said for availingourselves of this provision that it requires no adverse vote by us at the G.A.T.T.and demands no tortuous amendment of the rules. Article XXXV is after all an existing rule of the G.A.T.T., and no one can challenge our legal right to use it.19. Of the independent members of the Commonwealth, South Africa has consistently indicated that she will invoke Article XXXV, and Australia and NewZealand have hitherto been strongly disposed to do the same. The commercial and internal political pressures on these Tatter countries to invoke Article XXXVare very strong. France has also been very inclined towards Article XXXV.Given any kind of lead from us it seems probable, or at least possible, that thesecountries would all be prepared to accept Japan into G.A.T.T. upon the basis that the rights and obligations of the G.A.T.T. would not apply as between themand Japan. From the standpoint of our commercial interests in these markets, itwould suit us if these countries invoked Article XXXV since they would then beable to take action against Japan to protect their own manufacturing interestswithout any risk of incidental damage to our trade.Future Policy20. The growth of Japanese export trade which we must recognise to benecessary for her economic viability will inevitably involve adjustments some ofwhich may be painful in the pattern of our own export trade. I must, however,warn my colleagues that in my judgment British industry, with its heavy burdenof taxation and the rigidities inherent in our economic structure, is at present illplaced to engage in a keen struggle for markets with Japan. I believe and hopethat we are competitive with Europe. I have only recently pressed that we shouldtake not inconsiderable risks upon this broad assumption. But Japan, with hercombination of cheap labour and an industrial structure fortified by a massiveinflux of American capital, is a different story. We may one day be better fittedfor this struggle but both time and a very considerable degree of tax relief will be needed before industry can say so with confidence.21. I am not discussing in this paper whether we should continue to extend to Japan the most-favoured-nation treatment we at present give her on tariffs,or what trade policy we should pursue towards her. I am not suggesting that weshouldt^kea^purely negative line with regard to Japan; I have recently advocatedan as^e^ment in Colonial import restrictions to assist her to earn more sterling,and we must certainly be prepared to continue to adopt policies which recogniseher need to develop her export trade with the Sterling Area.22. The point which is nowajLissue is whether we should deny ourselves thefreedom we at present enjoy to liSSsEjS these policies, at our own discretion, if andwhen we should feel a real need to do so; and whether, at the risk of doing damage to our own commercial interests, we should discourage the Southern Dominionsfrom taking the action which they at present contemplate to preserve their ownfreedom. In my view, the political difficulties and the practical risks are such that we should not commit ourselves to an obligation to accord most-favoured-nation treatment to Japan, at least until there has been time to see both how wefare in competition with Japan in more normal circumstances and how over a
5period American commercial policy develops. The political objections to giving up our present freedom would, of course, be reinforced if Australia, New zealand and South Africa all preserve their freedom of action by invoking Article XXXV.Canada would then be the only white Dominion acting with us.23. Given the continued American support for Japanese accession, whichis probably to be assumed, Japan&apos;s eventual entry into the G.A.T.T. must probablybe regarded as a certainty. This, when it happens, must inevitably involve dangerof damage to our interests from action other countries may take to protect them-selves against Japanese competition. If we and a few others invoke Article XXXV,we shall still be exposed to this danger. We should, however, be able to demon -strate to industry not only that we have done everything in our power to makeother countries see the dangers of Japanese accession without any safeguards, butalso that we had at least retained our own freedom of action and had not dis-couraged countries who had appreciated the dangers from similarly retaining their freedom. If we follow a different course, it must be one that is demonstrablybetter. We could, I suggest, go at least some way to reconcile invocation ofArticle XXXV with our broader objectives of long-term policy by offering at thesame time to negotiate a separate agreement with the Japanese providing for the mutual extension of most-favoured-nation treatment on tariffs subject to a suitableescape clause which either side could invoke without reference to the ContractingParties to the G.A.T.T.; and other countries invoking Article XXXV might be willing to do likewise.Conclusions24.   I therefore reach the following conclusions:-(i) The assumption of the obligations of the G.A.T.T. towards Japan, even with the limited safeguards suggested by the Intersessional Committee,would involve serious commercial and political risks for this country which we could not justify to Parliament or to public opinion;(ii) South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and, possibly, France, appeardetermined to keep their hands free by invoking Article XXXV and itis manifestly in our commercial interests that they should do so;(iii) the political difficulties of our position would certainly be enhanced ifthe Southern Dominions invoked Article XXXV and we did not.25. In the light of these conclusions, I recommend that our policy shouldbe as follows:  (i) We should proceed upon the basis that we shall invoke Article XXXV and thereby keep our hands free at least until (a) we can see how we farein the face of increasing competition from Japan and (b) we have abetter opportunity of studying the practical working of a new Americanpolicy upon more liberal lines, once this has been evolved;(ii) we should forthwith inform the Governments of Austrialia, New zealand and South Africa, in confidence, of the lines on which we are thinking,with a view to encouraging them to stand firm by their present intentionof invoking Article XXXV;(iii) we should not at this stage make any public announcement, or say anything to the Americans, about our intentions pending the clarification we hope to secure from them in the near future on their attitude towards our request for freedom from the no-new-preference rule;(iv) but if, as is almost bound to happen, the Contracting Parties to the.   G.A.T.T. proceed at their next Session to a decision in principle onthe Japanese question, we should abstain from voting and make it clear,in doing so, that we are undertaking no commitment at that stage toaccept the obligations of the G.A.T.T. towards Japan and that we may,when the time comes, decide to invoke Article XXXV;(v) just how we&quot; say and explain this must depend to some extent upon, what has happened meanwhile to the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act and what the American position then is. If the Americans are obliged bytheir own legislative difficulties to delay the time-table for tariff negotia-tions and the Japanese accession that would follow them, we may beable to justify our line on the. ground that it is premature to ask for firm decisions and firm commitments;
\0(o6(vi) we should, in any event, make it clear that we would intend to continuetrading with Japan upon our existing basis and that we would be ready for our part to negotiate a separate agreement with Japan providingfor a mutual extension of most-favoured-nation treatment for japan on tariffs, subject to a suitable escape clause which either side couldinvoke without reference to the Contracting Parties to the G.A.T.T.P. T.Board of Trade, S.W.1,23rd April, 1953.annex the SAFEGUARDS CONSIDERED BY THE INTERSESSIONALCOMMITTEE AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS1. In the discussions of the Intersessional Committee, our objective (for whichwe were fighting with the active support of a minority of countries) was to secureprovision for discriminatory action against Japan in the event of a recurrence ofthe more violent and disruptive competition experienced before the war; we hadto recognise that it was only against this extreme contingency that we could look to secure special safeguards and that we should have to face much competition from Japan in many fields short of this extreme contingency.  Our concern was(a) that we should be able to deal with Japanese competition in the United kingdom market itself and, through Colonial Governments, in our Colonial markets;(b) that other countries, including the independent members of the Commonwealth,should be able to act to prevent damage to their local industries without in theprocess damaging our export interests; and (c) that independent members of theCommonwealth should, if willing, be able to act to protect our export interestsagainst Japanese competition.2. It early became clear that there was no chance of securing general accep-tance of any provision which singled out Japan as the one and only country against which there should be special safeguards and that a solution would have to besought on a basis formally applicable to any country. In the Report of the Inter-sessional Committee, which was ad referendum and in no way commits theGovernments of Contracting Parties represented on it, two lines of approach were considered, based on Articles XIX and XXIII of the G.A.T.T.Article XIX3. This is the Article which permits countries to take emergency action-ona non-discriminatory basis-if, as a result of obligations incurred under theG.A.T.T., imports cause or threaten serious injury to domestic producers. Underthe procedures of this Article, the injured country is.the final judge of the need for action, subject to consultation with the Contracting Parties and the ultimate rightof the countries affected by the action to retaliate. We suggested that the Articlemight be extended so as to provide for discriminatory action against a particular country in the circumstances for which we were seeking special safeguards. the americans (and others) strongly opposed this, both on general grounds and because it would have added to the difficulties of the United States Administration inlimiting resort to their own escape clause procedures.Article XXIII4. Under this Article the Contracting Parties, in circumstances which theyconsider serious enough to justify this, may (by majority decision) authorise a country to suspend its obligations to another country to such extent as they may
deem appropriate. The suggestion which emerged as most likely to command general acceptance was that if exports from a participating country cause or threaten&quot; violent disruption of trading conditions affecting a significant sector or sectors ofproduction &quot; in another country, this would be regarded as constituting a situationwhich could be referred to the Contracting Parties under the procedures of thisArticle. It was furthermore suggested that it might be agreed that in criticalcircumstances a country might take action provisionally in advance of dueauthorisation by the Contracting Parties if the latter had not reached a decisionwithin thirty days of the matter being referred to them. This provisional action would be subject to subsequent approval or disapproval. This was the furthestthe Americans and others were willing, reluctantly, to contemplate going towardsadmitting the possibility of discriminatory action without prior approval by the contracting Parties collectively.Territorial Application of the Article XXIII Proposal5. The Intersessional Committee were unable to make agreed recommenda-tions on this. The main possibilities discussed were that the procedure should beavailable (a) to a country in respect of its domestic industries and its export interestsin its Colonies;(b) to a country in respect of its domestic industries or the export interests ofother members of the same preferential area;(c) to any country in respect of its domestic industries or the export interestsof any other country.The Americans felt that (c) was so wide as to be open to abuse; and, while readyto accept (a), saw difficulty in (b) as singling out a preferential area for special treatment. This is also likely to be the Canadian attitude. While (a) would give us what, in practice, would probably be the most important part of what we should like to have, we should not rule out the possibility of prevailing,upon the americans to agree to a wider application if this were the sole issue on which acceptance of theArticle XXIII procedure depended.Possible Extension of the Article XXIII Procedure6. Our Delegation had authority, in the last resort, to accept, ad referendum,an extension of the Article XXIII procedure, which would have given countriesfreedom to act subject to the obligation to modify or withdraw the action if subse-quently required to do so by a majority decision of the Contracting Parties. Itwas, however, felt by the Delegation that against the general background of thediscussions and the attitude of the American and some other Delegations, this further loosening of the Article XXIII procedure would be most unlikely to be generally acceptable.The Disadvantages of the Article XXIII Proposal7. Our Delegation to the Intersessional Committee reserved their position on the Article XXIII proposal, pointing out the difficulties with which governments might be confronted, both in defending it politically, and in dealing with a futureemergency, if, having satisfied themselves of the need for emergency action, theywere then not free to act. Politically, there are obvious difficulties in convincingParliament and industry of the adequacy of safeguards dependent on the majoritydecision of countries whose interests may not coincide with ours. In practice,before we could refer the matter to the Contracting Parties, we should have tohave satisfied ourselves that a situation had developed or was threatening whichjustified a proposal for discriminatory action, and we should have had to haveformulated our views as to the exact nature of the action we wished to take. this in itself would necessarily take some time. Then, following reference to the Con^tracting Parties, a month, or possibly in practice longer, would elapse before wegot approval for taking the proposed action or became free to take it provisionally.Meanwhile, political pressure to act might be mounting, and heavy forestallingmight be taking place.8. Against all this, the sponsors of the proposal argue that for the extremecourse of breaching the non-discrirninatory rules of the G.A.T.T. to be justified,the problem of Japanese competition would need to have,become a matter of real
international concern, that this situation would not develop suddenly, and thatthere would be time for international discussion of the problem, including, as a first step, consultation with the Japanese with a view to reaching an agreed solution to the problem. In such extreme circumstances, the risk of failing to get approval for discriminatory action may admittedly be small, though it would not be easy to convince public opinion of this. Moreover, it is necessary to consider the implications of the action which would be open to us and other countries if(a) a country, having sought the approval of the Contracting Parties, underthe proposed Article XXIII procedure, for discriminatory action against japan, failed to secure this approval; or(b) it wanted to take action to deal with Japanese competition in circumstances which did not appear to warrant invocation of the Article XXIIIprocedure.Though the full effect of these implications might not be felt till quantitativerestriction of imports from Japan is no longer justified on balance of paymentsgrounds (or if still justified would need to be on a non-discriminatory basis), thepolicy we now adopt must look ahead to this eventuality: and, anyway, the needwhich is now arising, on balance of payments grounds, to ease up on restrictionson imports from Japan could very quickly begin to make these issues a reality. Solong as countries have balance of payments grounds for maintaining quantitative restrictions, they remain, under the existing G.A.T.T. rules, as we interpret them,free in theory to continue to restrict imports from Japan more severely than importsfrom other non-dollar countries. Our interpretation of these rules is, however,disputed, and in practice we should find it impossible to defend an obviouslyprotective use of balance of payments restrictions which was not justified on acommon sense interpretation of the needs of our balance of payments position. Inthe event, moreover, of a move towards convertibility, the new G.A.T.T. rules wehave envisaged would explicitly preclude any discrimination against Japan in theuse of balance of payments restrictions unless (as is very unlikely) Japan were tobecome a persistent creditor in relation to the rest of the world.Alternative Action Open to the United Kingdom in Respect of Imports into theUnited Kingdom9. We should be free to take protective action either by exercising the free-dom we anyway enjoy to raise unbound duties on a non-discriminatory basis orby taking non-discriminatory action under the emergency escape provisions ofArticle XIX as it now stands. We should be able to raise most-favoured-nationrates on a non-discriminatory basis at a risk of incidental damage to the trade of other foreign countries without imposing duties on Commonwealth goodsprovided we secure the freedom from the no-new-preference rule we are now seeking.Alternative Action Open to the United Kingdom (through Colonial Governments)in Respect of Imports into the Colonies10. If there were local production of a product, and if need to protect this could be advanced as, at least in part,, reason for wishing to restrict imports from japan, a Colonial Government could avail itself of Article XIX to introduce quan-titative restriction if it felt it could justify this as the most suitable way of dealingwith the problem. This quantitative restriction would need to be non-discrimina-tory, and one could not always rely on being able to relate it to a previous baseperiod in such a way as to keep Japanese imports within bounds while imposing aminimum of restrictions on imports from the United Kingdom.11. If, however, the Colonial Government wanted to use the tariff to protecta local industry or if there were no local production and the Colonial Governmentwere wanted to take action solely to protect our exporting interests, the only actionopen to it would be to raise the tariff on a non-discriminatory basis. Colonialtariffs are unbound and Colonial Governments are free (so far as the G.A.T.T. isconcerned) to raise them at any time. However, a raising of the most-favoured-nation rates would, under the no-new-preference rule, entail a correspondingraising of preferential rates. Moreover, the Congo Basin Treaties and our Trustee-ship obligations would, in the territories to which they apply, preclude such raising
of most-favoured-nation rates. Anyway, it is unlikely that Colonial governments would be prepared to effect a general raising of duties for the sake of checkingcheap Japanese imports in the circumstances in question.12. Theoretically, therefore, the only fully satisfactory answer is that we should retain, in respect of Colonial Territories, freedom to discriminate against japan and to use quotas where these seemed appropriate to deal with Japanese corn-petition. In practice, however, the value of this freedom would depend on theextent Colonial Governments were willing, in the interests of United Kingdomproducers, to deprive themselves of unlimited access to cheap Japanese goods.How far, at some future time, we might be able to carry Colonial territories with us in measures designed to protect our industries from Japanese competition would depend on many factors, including the extent and nature of the competition; thetendencies are, however, all towards increasing political and economic independ-ence. It may thus be that we should not be sacrificing so much of real substanceas might now appear to be the case if we forewent a unilateral right to take dis-criminatory action in respect of imports into our Colonies and relied on gettingapproval under the proposed Article XXIII procedure to do this if Japanese corn-petition again assumed really violent and disruptive forms; but this is not a point which can easily be explained to public opinion.Alternative action open to other Commonwealth Countries13. A realistic assessment of the risks for our exporting interests of acceptanceof the Article XXIII proposal by other independent Commonwealth countriesnecessitates looking separately at each country and inevitably involves some element of judgment. South Africa appears to be determined to retain full freedom ofaction by invoking Article XXXV. Canada is believed to be thinking of taking such limited action as might be necessary to enable them to deal with japanese competition by arbitrary customs valuation on a basis which would nominally benon-discriminatory but would in practice be devised so as to hit Japan withoutsignificantly affecting imports from the United Kingdom. India and Pakistan are probably reckoning that for as long ahead as they think it worth while to look theywill be maintaining balance of payments quantitative restrictions for developmentalreasons and that they could, if necessary, use these to counter Japanese competition.Australia and New Zealand14. We do not yet know how these countries will react to the report of theIntersessional Committee. For commercial and internal political reasons, they arelikely to abandon their existing inclination to invoke Article XXXV only with thegreatest of reluctance, though, in the final resort, they might see difficulty, on widerpolitical grounds, in taking this course in virtual isolation. It is in the case ofAustralia and New Zealand, if they did accept the obligations of the G.A.T.T.towards Japan, that the potential disadvantages of the Article XXIII approach,from our point of view, would be most serious. The local industries in thesecountries and, in particular, in Australia are likely to be very sensitive to corn-petition from Japan, and their Governments could very quickly come under pressure to take action on behalf of these industries in circumstances which might not beso serious as to justify the Contracting Parties in allowing discriminatory action under the Article XXIII procedure. There would then be a very real danger thatthe raising of most-favoured-nation rates of duty would lead to increases in duties on imports from the United Kingdom because of the no-new-preference rule.From the point of view of our commercial interest in the Australian and NewZealand markets, it would suit us best if Australia and New Zealand were to invoke article XXXV and thus keep their full freedom; and if we invoked Article XXXV,they would almost certainly follow suit.Foreign Countries15. If foreign countries found it necessary to take action to deal with japanese competition in circumstances in which they did not think it justifiable to seek, or could not persuade the Contracting Parties to approve, discriminatoryaction, tariff measures would need to be on a non-discriminatory basis and mightincidentally damage our exporting interests.
10Summary of Implications of the Article XXIII Proposal16. To sum up the implications of the Article XXIII proposal, it would appearthat if, in relation to the territories in which responsibility for taking action rested with us, we considered that in practice we would judge it justifiable to seek to discriminate against Japan only if Japanese competition was causing really serious trouble over a fairly wide front, we should be taking some risks, though not perhapsexcessive risks, in accepting the Article XXIII procedure. On the other hand, firstly,it would be difficult to convince Parliament and industry that the risks were reason-able ones to take, and, secondly, if other countries were forced, as certain of themmight well be, by public opinion to take action against less severe manifestationsof Japanese competition, the Article XXIII procedure might well not give themfreedom to act without incidentally damaging our export interests.
