(46) 128.mh March, 1946.REORGANISATION OF THE B.B.C. HOME SERVICES.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council and the Postmaster-General.1. On the 20th December, 1945, the Cabinet considered a report (CM. (45)61th Conclusions, Minute 1) which we bad prepared on broadcasting policy inconjunction with the Minister of Information and the Minister of State(CP. (45) 293) and approved the recommendations which we made regardingthe reorganisation of the B.B.C.&apos;s Home Services.2. We hope shortly to submit to the Cabinet a draft White Paper on the renewal of the B.B.C. Charter and the reorganisation of the B.B.C.&apos;s services which might serve as a basis for a Parliamentary Debate on the future of theCorporation. There are, however, two questions arising out of the reorganisation of services which we think ought to be brought before our colleagues as a matterof urgency.  These are :  (a) The system of regionalisation to be adopted in the Home Service.(b) The date on which the reorganised services, including the new &quot; C &quot;programme, intended to serve the educated listener, should beintroduced.3. It was stated in paragraph 34 of CP. (45) 293 that with the continuedassignment of two medium wavelengths to the European Service, the B.B.C.will have at its disposal seven medium wavelengths for the Home Service (i.e., theservice organised on a regional basis) and one medium wavelength (supplemented by two international common wavelengths which can only be used on low power)for the &quot; C &quot; programme. Since then one additional medium wavelength hasbeen made available for the &quot; C &quot; programme. With these resources the B.B.C.hoped to be able to provide a satisfactory service for between 90 and 93 per cent,of listeners in the Home Service and roughly 80 per cent, for the &quot; C &quot; programme.4. Since the meeting of the Cabinet on the 20th December, 1945, we havebeen discussing with the B.B.C. the detailed implications of this reorganisationscheme.1. The Home Service.5.   At  present  the  Home  Service  is  organised   into  seven   regionalprogrammes : (i) London.(ii) West of England.(iii) Midland.(iv) Northern,(v) Scottish.(vi) Welsh.(vii) Northern Ireland.It reaches 93-8 per cent, of the total population as compared with approxi-mately 87 per cent, before the war.   90-4 per cent, of the total population are served by their own Region.[31556]
6. The overriding need to continue to use two medium wavelengths for theEuropean service and, at the same time to release wavelengths for the third(&quot; C &quot;) programme leaves the Hbme (Regional) Service insufficient wavelengthsto operate the existing seven Regions (including four in England) without a drastic reduction both in the total number of listeners served and in the quality of the programme received by very many.7. The only technically possible way of compensating the Home Service forthe loss of the wavelengths would be to reduce the total number of regions to four,that is to have one Region only for the whole of England, with separate Regionsfor Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland respectively. Such an arrangement would enable the greatest possible number of listeners, more in fact than are provided for at present, to be served with the number of wavelengths available and would entirely avoid &quot; cross-regionalisation &quot; ?&apos;.*?., the serving of listenerssituated in one region by means of a programme designed for listeners in anotherregion.8. There are serious political objections to the creation of only one EnglishRegion and we consider that a compromise arrangement will have to be adopted at the expense of a deterioration of the service received by some listeners.Separate Regions must be retained for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,but for England there are two possibilities : (i) Three English Regions (Northern England, Southern England and london), or(ii) Two English Regions, viz., Northern England and Southern Englandonly.9. The former alternative, which was that recommended in CP. (45) 293,involves the amalgamation of the Midland and West of England Regions^ andwill result in the percentage of the population which receives any Home Regionalprogramme rising to 94-3 per cent., with a decrease in the percentage whichreceives its own Regional programme from 90-4 per cent, to 85-6 per cent.This means that although there will be a small net increase in the total numberof listeners who can receive a Home Service programme, over 2 million people who are now getting their own Regional programme will have to put up with a programme devised for another Region.10. Under this rearrangement the following will be the main sources of complaint: *(a) Keen listeners to the existing West of England service will naturallyobject to its disappearance.(b) The Northern half of Devon and Cornwall, and an area on the bordersof Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, will be deprived altogether of theHome Service (which they are receiving at the moment).(c) There will be three new substantial areas in which listeners will haveto take their Home Services from regions of which they do not regard themselves as a natural part, namely : (i) An area around Norwich;(ii) Portsmouth-Southampton; (iii) Derby-Nottingham; the first twoof which will receive Midland instead of London programmes andthe third Northern instead of Midland programmes.11. The other alternative, a five Regional arrangement embracing twoEnglish Regions only, would give a fractional further increase in the totalproportion of the population who would receive some Home programme. its main advantage, however, would be that it would obviate altogether &quot; cross-regionalisation &quot; in Southern England, e.g., the Norwich and Portsmouth-Southampton areas would receive a general South of England programme like allthe rest. There would also be the advantage that Midlanders might at firstimpact be more ready to sacrifice their local programme to the conception of anall-embracing South of England region rather than merely to be merged withthe West. Further, it would be easier to cover the small areas of the NorthDevon coast which will be deprived of a Home Service under either arrangement,with an additional transmitter.12. The disadvantage of this geographically neater arrangement would bethat either : \(a) the Home Service provided to the whole of Southern England, includingthe South Midlands, would be entirely centralised on London; or
(b) the vast metropolitan population in London, the Home Counties, andSouth-East England would be forced to have in their Home Servicelocalised material from the Midlands (Birmingham) and the WestCountry (Bristol), to which they would object.13. Under (a) there would undoubtedly be strong protests at the arbitraryreversal of British broadcasting policy towards regionalisation throughout theSouth and the Midlands (the North being the only other English &quot; region &quot;) :under (b) irritation might be caused to millions of listeners in the London area.14. It will be seen, therefore, that whichever of the alternatives set out inparagraph 8 above is adopted, there is bound to be fairly widespread local dis-satisfaction with the reorganisation of the Home Service. Three English regions would retain a greater measure of regionalisation and would be welcomed bypatriotic Midlanders. Two English regions would eliminate from the South ofEngland cross regionalisation, which may prove peculiarly irritating to thosewho have to suffer from it. The B.B.C., however, whose opinion in these mattersmust clearly carry great weight, are most strongly in favour of retaining the threeregions already approved by the Cabinet, and, on balance, we recommend that theCabinet should accept this view.2. The Date far the Introduction of the Reorganised Services.15. While the &quot; C &quot; programme represents a very important addition tothe services provided for the majority of listeners, its introduction will give riseto complaint from listeners who are outside its radius. Roughly speaking, itwill reach an area of about 100 miles round Droitwich and will be carried, by special local transmitters, to cities outside this area with a population of over120,000. This coverage will exclude from the &quot; C &quot; programme a considerablearea of the Northern Counties, the South-East and South Coasts and Devon andCornwall, and wide areas of Scotland and Northern Ireland, from all of whichwe must expect demands for the extension of the programme, demands whichcannot be met with the available wavelengths and in the present state of wirelesstechnique.16. This prospect must be accepted as inevitable. But it is clearly desirable that the volume of complaint should be minimised. The B.B.C. had originally intended that the &quot; C &quot; programme should be introduced about themiddle of June. In our discussions, however, it emerged that if this date werechosen, a considerable area of the Southern Counties comprising roughly the coastal areas of Sussex and Southern Kent, would receive an exceptionally badservice during the months of July, August and September. The reason for thisis that the &quot; C &quot; programme will require a reallocation of wavelengths in theHome Services and that until the height of the transmitting mast at the B.B.C.&apos;sLondon station at Brookman&apos;s Park has been increased, the wavelength intended for the London region will not reach the area in question. The new Brookman&apos;sPark aerial cannot be expected to be in operation before the beginning of October.If, therefore, the &quot; C &quot; programme is introduced in mid-June, there is a serious danger of exceptionally strong criticism from people living in this area of theSouth Coast on the ground that although their wireless licence charge has been increased, they are not receiving the &quot; C &quot; programme and have been deprivedfor three months of the Home Service. In these circumstances it seems to usvery desirable that the introduction of the &quot; C &quot; programme should be delayed until the new mast at Brookman&apos;s Park comes into operation.17. The Corporation are prepared to accept this delay provided that they are allowed to make an early announcement that the &quot; C &quot; programme will be intro-duced on the 1st October. In view of the fact that the public have been given some reason to believe that the &quot; C &quot; programme would be introduced duringthe summer, and that the Corporation are receiving many enquiries as to the precise date, this request seems to us to be reasonable. The date of introductionwill, however, in our view, have to be further postponed if the mast cannot bebrought into service by the 1st October.Conclusions.18.   To sum up : (1) We think that our colleagues should be aware of the possibility that there organisation of the B.B.C. Services will give rise to a considerable
volume of criticism. Our answer to this criticism must be that there organisation of the Services represents a considerable overallimprovement on the present services, and that, in view of the limited number of wavelengths available, the new services, which give a bettercoverage of the Home programme than before the war plus the adcli-tional &quot; C &quot; programme, are the best that can be provided.(2) We recommend that we should stick to the regional arrangementsapproved by the Cabinet in December 1945, reducing the number of english regions to three by the merging of the Midland and West ofEngland Regions.(3) We recommend that the &quot; C &quot; programme and with it the reorganisation of the Home Service should be deferred until the new high mast atthe Brookman&apos;s Park Station is available if possible, on the1st October, 1946 and that the B.B.C. should be empowered to announce that they plan to introduce the &quot; C &quot; programme on thatdate.H.
