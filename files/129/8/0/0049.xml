/THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-    259Printed for the Cabinet.   A pril 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 149.10th April, 1946.CABINET.0 0NATIONALISATION OF TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.MY paper S.I. (M) (46) 4 of the 23rd February has recently been discussed by the Socialisation of Industry Committee and its proposals have been generally approved by them, subject to some suggestions which I have embodied in thepresent paper.2. I deal at more length in paragraphs 3-18 below with the case of road transport; the other proposals in SI. (M) (46) 4 are briefly as follows : (a) There will be a British Transport Commission (B.T.C.) consisting of a chairman and four other members, to which there will be transferredcompulsorily by the terms of the Bill all the railways and canals whichare now under control. Power will be taken to acquire by agreementany minor railway or canal undertaking not covered by the presentcontrol.(b) The undertakings of the railway companies will be taken over as a whole,.including all their ancillary businesses and investments (which cover-about 25 per cent, of the country&apos;s dock system, steamships, hotels, &amp;c,and important interests in road transport, both passenger and goods).(c) Power would be taken to enable B.T.C. to acquire privately ownedrailway wagons.(d) B.T.C. would be enable to license the non-statutory canal carrying com-panies, to acquire such businesses by agreement and themselves tocarry if they saw fit.(e) B.T.C. will be given powers to acquire long-distance road haulage servicesand long-distance road passenger services.(/) There will be enabling powers to reorganise in regional groups local road passenger services and to transfer additional undertakings, includingmunicipal undertakings, subject to confirmation by Parliament, to be.T.C. where that course is necessary in order to achieve adequateco-ordination.(g) Similar powers will be taken in respect of the docks not owned by therailway companies.(h) B.T.C. would have the general duty of promoting and securing theprovision of an adequate and properly co-ordinated system of transport and of so fixing fares and charges as to secure that revenues would suffice to defray the expenses of the whole system, taking one year with another; B.T.C. will be subject to directions of a general characterissued to them by the Minister.(i) While all transport assets will vest in B.T.C., management and operation will be delegated to three Executives for Railways, Road transport and Docks and Inland Waterways. Power will be taken to createadditional Executives- if that course is found by experience to bedesirable and it will be possible to set up an appropriate separateorganisation under B.T.C. to administer and develop hotel and catering-facilities.   Staff will be interchangeable between the Executives.[31631]b
As explained in paragraph 5 of S.I. (M) (4.6) 4, it is necessary toadopt at the outset a scheme of organisation based on the presentfunctional structure of the different branches of transport. But I agree with the Socialisation of Industry Committee that scope mustbe left for ultimate combination of all transport activities underregional boards, working under the central direction of B.T.C., ifexperience indicates that, when acquisition and other initial processesare complete, such an alteration in lay-out is likely to secureadvantages.(j) The L.P.T.B. will, in future, be appointed by the Minister.(k) I have settled with the Chancellor of the Exchequer a general basis foracquisition in the special case of the railways. I shall shortly submit to the S.I. Committee appropriate terms for other transport under-takings, with the necessary provisions for arbitration in cases of dispute.(I) On rates, charges and facilities, the existing arrangements will continue with minor modifications during the period which B.T.C. will requireto consider the principles which should govern such matters. Theprinciples so formulated should be referred to an appropriateAdvisory Committee. If the Minister is satisfied, he should thenobtain the approval of Parliament to their adoption. A transport tribunal will be charged with the duty of settling the details. Untilthe main network of our inland transport services have been brought under common ownership, it would be premature to attempt to giveform to the principles which must govern rates and charges in a unfiedtransport system. The new principles must take a substantial time towork out and it is in view of their importance to the trading communitythat I suggest that Parliament should have an opportunity to approvethem.(m) Coastwise shipping will not be nationalised. A formal arrangement for close and continuous consultation with the Chamber of shipping would be laid down with a view to ensuring that efficient coastwise shipping services are maintained to the extent declared from timeto time by the Minister to be required in the national interest. Thiswill involve at least avoidance of the quotation of unduly competitiveexceptional rates by the rail or road undertakings of B.T.C. andarrangements for combined land and sea freights and facilities, andmay require other safeguards. *(u) In view of the precedents relating to statutory transport and other undertakings, it wall be necessary to make provision for compensa-tion of staff who are displaced as a result of transfer, or whoseconditions of service are worsened, and also to preserve the super -annuation rights of existing employees. The form of these clauseswill depend to some extent upon the general decision to be reached in this matter, but I regard it as essential to retain the loyal serviceand goodwill of the staff taken over from existing undertakings.Provision will also have to be made for a suitable conciliation machinery, and I agree with the Minister of Labour and NationalService that this maohineiw should be regarded as part of the equip-ment of the industry itself and not be directly linked with theGovernment.(o) Provision would be made for a series of Advisory Committees in the regions and at Headquartei-s to keep before B.T.C. the needs of users of the transport system for good service and development.  .Road Haulage.3. This represents the most difficult aspect of our policy. It may assistthe Cabinet&apos;s consideration of the matter if I describe briefly the generalstructure of the industry.4. There are approximately half a million motor vehicles designed for the carriage of goods.5. Of these, 350,000 are operated under C. licences, i.e., nsed by theirowners for the carriage of their oavii goods, and are not subject to any limitation
of distance under the Traffic Acts, though temporarily they are limited to60 miles. About 75 per cent, of these vehicles are engaged in wholesale or retail distribution and are seldom used outside a radius of 40 miles from their base a distance which enables the vehicles to make the return journey, with stopsfor distribution, within a working day. The remaining 25 per cent, are mainlyoperated by the larger wholesale distributors and by industrialists with plantsup and down the country who use the vehicles as a private transport system.In a small but growing number of cases, the vehicles are analogous to a conveyor-belt.6. Exclusive of 10,000 vehicles owned by the Railway Companies, thereare 140,000 vehicles operated by 60,000 owners under A. and B. licences to carrygoods of others for hire or reward. The A. licence-holders, of whom there are about 30,000, are restricted to public haulage, and the average number of vehicles owned per licence is three. The 35,000 B. licence-holders can both carrytheir own goods and, subject to conditions, engage in public haulage; in this class, the average number of vehicles owned per licence is about one and a half.Unfortunately, in respect of distances run, there is no clear-cut distinctionbetween A. and B. licence-holders and many of the latter, on occasions, operateover substantial distances; some owners operate under both types of licence.7. The small working operators have little in the way of overhead expenses and depend, to a large extent, on their local and personal contacts. Perhaps about one half of the 150,000 vehicles (including the 10,000 of the railways) are notregularly used outside a radius of 20 miles from their base. At the other extremeare probably 20,000 vehicles owned by between two and three thousand operators,with organisations of varying size, which are more or less regularly used for haulsof 60 miles and upwards. The remaining vehicles are used in interveningdistances, but both the short and the long-distance vehicles are frequently usedfor varying purposes and any close analysis of their employment is impracticable.8. A national transport system will largely depend for its success on thescope of its monopoly being wide enough to ensure that it obtains a volume oftraffic sufficient (a) to cover its overhead costs; and (b) to enable it to operate at reasonable rates and with economic loadings. On the other hand, the roadvehicle and its driver or crew often perform a wide variety of services over and above the strict carriage of goods wdiich a nation-wide monopoly might find itdifficult to offer.9. Against this background, I have had to consider how best to give effect toour declared policy of bringing long-distance road haulage services under nationalownership with the implication that some suitable field of operation should stillbe left to the independent haulier. I can derive some assistance from the schemeof control over the carriage of goods by road, which wras exercised before the warby the Traffic Commissioners as the Licensing Authorities for goods vehicles, andis about to be revived.10. In the first place, it is, I think, clear that the C. licensee carrying hisuwn bona fide goods, should be free to operate his own vehicles for this purposewithin a radius of 40 miles from his specified base, and this freedom must, in my view, extend, not only to wholesale or retail traders, but to industrialists. Theright to carry his own goods in his own vehicles is the best answer to any traderwho complains that he is being subjected to an oppressive monopoly. At thesame time, we cannot afford to see a drift of traffic away from the public haulageS3&apos;stem to vehicles running under C. licences over distances for which the nationalsystem can and should provide a good and economical service. I propose, there-fore, that the C. licensee should require special authority from the licensing authority if he desires to run further than 40 miles from his base, and that the onus should rest upon him to satisfy that Authority that his business requiressuch greater latitude for special reasons. This latitude would, of course, nothave to be sought load by load, but would normally be governed by suitableconditions attached to the licence. B.T.C. would have a right to be heard in opposition to applications for such latitude. It will be proper to take powersto ensure that C. licences are available only to bona fide carriers of their owngoods, and that abuses such as those which gave rise to difficulty in NorthernIreland should be stopped.In the Appendix will be found the general outline of the clause T have in mind for regulating the grant of special C. licences.[31631] b 2
11. As regards the A. and B. licence-holders, the outline of my previousproposals is stated shortly below : (a) B.T.C. would acquire those undertakings operating wholly or mainly on hauls of 40 miles and upwards; these undertakings would formthe nucleus of the new organisation and the basis of B.T.C.&apos;s monopoly,since no operation beyond a point to point distance of 40 miles couldbe undertaken except under their authorisation.(&amp;) Persons carrying for hire or reward for shorter distances would besubject, as at present, to licensing control by the Area licensing authorities. Every operator would, by virtue of his licence, beallowed freedom of operation (without risk of objection by B.T.C.)within a radius of 10 miles from a specified base. Outside thatradius the Licensing Authority would, after hearing any representa-tions from B.T.C., have discretion to grant the independent hauliera licence authorising him to undertake hauls up to 20 miles point to point, and these hauls might be undertaken outside the 10 milesradius, but limited to any areas or routes or traffics specified in thelicence. For hauls of more than 20 miles point to point outside the10 miles radius, the consent of B.T.C. would be necessary, but any existing operator who was refused such a consent, or had conditionsattached to that consent which he regarded as unreasonable, wouldhave a right to require B.T.C. to take over that part of his business which he was forced to discontinue, on terms which would be laiddown in the Bill. In such circumstances, B.T.C. should have the option of taking over the whole of the business.(c) B.T.C. would have an unrestricted right to operate vehicles over anydistance, but would be discouraged by a general direction from theMinister, from undertaking short hauls of less than 10 miles exceptin so far as the goods were for collection or delivery before or afterconveyance by other road, rail or canal services of B.T.C.. or incontinuation of a business which B.T.C. had acquired.(d) By combination of the monopoly and the control by licence described above, it should be practicable to secure a sufficient volume of longand medium distance traffic for B.T.C. By enabling them to &quot; dove-tail &quot; their services with the shorter distance services of the indepen-dent hauliers, the scheme should also secure a large measure of co-ordination between public and private haulage, while leaving thelatter room in which to live.12. The scheme outlined in paragraph 11 has been devised to accord, sofar as possible, with existing operational practice. I have, however, considered,in the light of the criticisms of some of my colleagues, whether it could be modifiedon less restrictive lines. No scheme which depends upon distances can avoid giving rise to some degree of arbitrariness, and to the necessity for severingexisting businesses and the risk of harsh treatment of those hauliers who find themselves faced with the alternative of restricting their activities or goingout of business.13. It would, however, be possible to eliminate the distinction betweenhauls up to 20 miles and hauls between 20 and 40 miles (in each case point topoint) which is the feature of my original proposal, and to leave independenthauliers free to operate on point to point hauls not exceeding 40 miles in length,subject only to securing a licence from the licensing authority, and such condi-tions as that authority might impose. B.T.C. would, of course, be free to competefor this medium distance haulage and have a right to object to the grant of a licence to others. They would be discouraged, as I have proposed, from under-taking short hauls of less than 10 miles, and generally encouraged to co-ordinatetheir services in the sphere of medium haulage with the independent hauliers.14. I am not in favour of the solution just mentioned which is open to the objection that B.T.C., whale not itself requiring a licence, would be exposed tocompetition for a large volume of traffic, the extent of this competitiondepending upon the exercise of their discretion by the licensing authority. Fromthe opposite point of view, it may also be objected that an adverse decision ofthe Licensing Authority, based on representations by B.T.C., might injuriouslyaffect a haulier without giving him any right to compensation. Under existing conditions, the haulier has no right to a continuance of his licence, but all hisroad competitors are in the same position.
15. A greater degree of simplification would be obtained if an inter-mediate zone were dispensed with, so that the independent haulier would be free to operate within a specified radius of his base, and to operate beyond thatradius only with the consent of B.T.C. In such conditions, a radius of 25 milesmight be appropriate. Within it hauliers would be free to operate subject onlyto licence. It would not be practicable to exclude B.T.C. from undertaking haulsup to 25 miles, but they would be discouraged from catering for the shorterhauls. B.T.C. would control all hauls beyond those permitted by the 25-mileradius in each case, and would be free, either to permit operators to continuesubject to conditions, or to refuse permission to operate beyond the radius. if.T.C. refused permission to operate beyond the radius, or imposed conditionswhich the operator considered to be unacceptable, the latter would have the rightto require B.T.C. to take over the part of his business which had to be discon-tinued, and in that case B.T.C. should have the alternative of buying out thewhole concern.Road Passenger Transport.16. It is proposed to confer powers on B.T.C. to acquire long-distance road passenger services which are directly competitive with the railways. It will also benecessary to give them power to acquire other passenger transport undertakings,including those now owned by the municipalities, in so far as that proves to bethe best means of securing an adequate degree of co-ordination. But we may&apos;encounter strong opposition from many of the municipalities (numbering about one hundred) which at present take a lively interest in their own transport under-takings, and I therefore propose, as a parallel procedure, that B.T.C. shouldhave the duty of calling for the formulation of a co-ordinated scheme of passenger transport from local authorities and companies in selected areas of suitable size,whereby joint or district boards could be formed to operate the services. these schemes might, or might not, require the transfer of the combined undertaking to B.T.C., and, in view of this possibility, the schemes should be submitted totlhe Minister for his approval, and then for confirmation by Parliament underthe special Parliamentary procedure.17. B.T.C. will have a general right to operate excursions and tours andalso contract carriages. There may well be valuable&apos; opportunities for B.T.C.to develop facilities for holidays-at-home and to encourage tourist traffic fromabroad, especially in conjunction with their steamer and rail and road servicesand their ownership of hotels.18. The London Passenger Transport Board presents a special problem and can probably best be treated as a regional board under the general direction of.T.C., subject to the overriding powers of the Minister.19. I need not elaborate my proposals in regard to docks or coastwise shipping, or deal at this stage with the numerous transitional and machineryclauses which will be required. My object will not be to overburden the Bill withunnecessary detail, but at the same time to present as complete and tidy a scheme as is possible.   This should avoid rather than increase criticism.20. If the Bill is to be ready early in the autumn, as it should be, I shall require the whole-time services of a Draftsman immediately after Easter. I hopethat my colleagues will give authority for a Draftsman to be assigned to me,and also authorise me to discuss the general scheme for dealing with the various branches of transport confidentially with those sections of the industry whichare in a position to negotiate with me.A. B.Ministry of Transport, W. 1,l6th&apos;April, 1946.APPENDIX.-C. Licences.These licences, to which no conditions apart from those relating to safetyhave attached in peace-time, would in future authorise the carriage of goods for, or in connection with, the holder&apos;s trade or business up to a radius of 40 roadmiles from the base at which they are normally kept, and to such further extent
as may be allowed by virtue of any special conditions which the applicant is ableto show to be justified by the particular character of his business.In deciding whether special conditions are justified the Licensing authority will be directed to have regard to-(i) The extent to which it is necessary for the applicant to employ his ownvehicles for the purpose of connecting two or more plants or depots of,or associated with, nis trade or business.(ii) The effect on the trade or business of the applicant, including the extentto which additional costs in packing, handling and breakages arelikely to be incurred, if the special conditions are not attached.(iii) Alternative available means of suitable public transport.(iv) Any representations made by B.T.C., particularly as to the extent towhich the applicant calls upon the Commission to carry any of histraffic.The C. licence would be subject to revocation if (i) The conditions subject to which it was issued have not been complied with.(ii) The vehicles have not been operated in accordance with the purposesdisclosed in the application.(iii) The vehicles have been used for carriage of goods in pursuance orfurtherance of a transaction the purpose or effect of whidh, whatever may have been its form, was to provide in substance for the use ofthe vehicle for the carriage of goods for hire or reward.Period of Licence.The applicant would not have to justify his licence every year. C. licenceswould be valid for three years (or, perhaps in the case of licences to which no special conditions are attached, for five years).Appeals against refusal of a C. licence to operate beyond 40 miles and againstrevocation.It is proposed that the applicant should have a right to appeal against anyrefusal of a request for special conditions to the independent Transport Tribunal,which will be required for other purposes of the Act. In that event B.T.C. shouldbe given a right of appeal against the grant of conditions to which it had objected..
