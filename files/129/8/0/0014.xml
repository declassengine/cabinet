The Allied Control Council at their meeting in Berlin on the 8th March settled the terms of a plan giving effect to the Potsdamreparations Agreement. This plan was accepted by the American and Sovietmembers on behalf of their Governments and was referred by the British andFrench members to their Governments for approval. The views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in regard to the plan have been asked for in time for the next meeting of the Control Council on the 20th March. In view of the urgency of thisquestion I suggest that this paper should be considered by my colleagues onMonday, the 18th March.I hope to circulate another paper before or at the Meeting containingsuggestions as to how the problem should be handled.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1, 16^, March, 1946.LEVEL OF GERMAN INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.1. Ministers will remember that, as a result of the Agreements reached atYalta and Potsdam, Germany is to make the maximum reparation consistent withbeing left enough resources to subsist without external assistance at an averageliving standard not exceeding that of European countries other than the UnitedKingdom and Russia. It was agreed at Potsdam that the claims of the U.S.S.R.and of Poland would be met by removals from Eastern Germany and those ofother countries from Western Germany, except that the U.S.S.R. and Polandwere in addition to receive between them 25 per cent, of the deliveries of capital equipment from the Western zones, part of which would be paid for in an equivalent value of other commodities. The amount of equipment to be removed from the Western zones was to be determined within six months, that is to say,by the 2nd February, 1946.2. Discussions were duly started in Berlin to determine the level of industry which Germany should be permitted to retain, and hence the amount of equip-ment which should be removed from the Western zones. These discussions raninto difficulty over the question of the steel industry and, in the hope ofbroadening the field of discussion and thus facilitating agreement, I sought theauthority of the Prime Minister for the circulation to the Allied Co-co-ordinating committee of a comprehensive plan for the reduction of the whole of Germany &apos;industrial capacity. This plan, which was presented to the Co-co-ordinating committee on the 31st December, 1945, followed the general policy already approved by the Cabinet.   In addition to the suppression of all manufacture of[31490] b
strictly war weapons, aircraft, &amp;c, on which there could be no controversy, theplan provided for the following measures of industrial disarmament: (i) The reduction of shipbuilding to the minimum scale necessary to main-tain a fleet of small coastal and fishing vessels and internal canaltraffic, and the elimination, apart from these, of the whole german merchant marine.(ii) The total elimination of high-pressure hydrogenation plants and of allproduction in such plants of synthetic oil, ammonia and methanol, \and the elimination, or at least the reduction to home requirements, )of the production (as distinct from the fabrication) of aluminium,magnesium and synthetic rubber,(iii) The limitation of steel capacity to 9 million tons, with a corresponding reduction in the level of the general engineering industry, including in particular machine-tool holdings and the production of machine tools, locomotives and heavy vehicles; and the total elimination of theball-bearing industry.3.   These measures would have had the following effects on the economy ofGermany by 1949 : (i) An overall reduction in the value of industrial output to less than two-thirds of the 1938 level,(ii) An overall reduction in the level of output of metals and engineering toabout 40 per cent, of that of 1938.(iii) A reduction in private consumers&apos; expenditure to 70 per cent, to 75 percent, of that obtaining in 1938.(iv) A reduction in expenditure on food to 75 per cent, to 80 per cent, of thepre-war level, leaving only about two-thirds of Germany&apos;s pre-war consumption of meat, fats and other animal products,(v) A reduction in consumption of textiles, clothing, boots and shoes toabout 65 per cent, of the pre-war level,(vi) A reduction in housing standards to about 70 per cent, of the pre-war level.(vii) A reduction in imports to just under Rm. 3 billion, and in exports toabout Rm. 3-2 billion, leaving a surplus of Rm. 200 million towardsthe costs of occupation.4. These proposals naturally caused me uneasiness but nothing less drasticwas feasible under the terms of the Potsdam Agreement. Nevertheless, theproposals were regarded as too mild by our Allies, particularly in respect of the steel capacity which Germany should be allowed to retain. In order to reach agreement, the British Delegation, after much discussion, accepted a reductionin the figure for steel capacity from 9 million tons to 7\ million tons. this reduction, however, upset the balance of the British plan and, in order to avoid a position in which Germany would be left with a substantial deficit on herbalance of payments, the Overseas Reconstruction Committee of the Cabinet at its meeting on the 25th January agreed that relaxations might be made inrespect of synthetic oil, nitrogen, rubber and similar plants. I was authorised in further negotiations to work on the basis that such plants could be temporarilymaintained in, or restored to, production, should this be found necessary for thepurpose of balancing Germany&apos;s trading account and thus easing the burden onthe British taxpayer.5. At the same meeting of the Overseas Reconstruction Committee anotherpoint was discussed, namely, the interpretation to be given to the passage in the potsdam Agreement which limits Germany&apos;s industrial capacity to an amountsufficient to provide her with a standard of living not exceeding the average of all european countries other than the United Kingdom and U.S.S.R. Did this mean that Germany was to be permanently held down to this level or was it intendedto allow her to recover gradually through her own efforts provided some limita-tion was imposed on the development of her war important industries? TheCommittee agreed with the latter interpretation and felt that a distinction should be drawn between measures to deal with the short term and reparationstage and &quot;those which it may be necessary to impose for the long-term control ofGerman industry.6. Meanwhile discussions in Berlin have been proceeding and at a meetingof the Control Council on the 8th March a quadripartite plan, prepared by theAllied Economic Directorate, was accepted unconditionally by the American and
in soviet representatives. The British and French representatives undertook tosubmit the plan to their Governments for approval. A final decision was deferred until the next meeting of the Control Council on the 20th March.7. I set out in the Annex comparisons between the new quadripartite plan and the original British plan. Table I shows the permitted level of production(including an allowance for imports where necessary) for the principal industries under each of the two plans.   Table II gives a comparative balance of payments.6. It will be seen that the two plans are not very dissimilar. In additionto the reduction in the figure for steel capacity (see paragraph 4 above) the new plan prescribes lower production levels for a number of important industriesincluding engineering chemicals, synthetic textiles, cement and electric power.The export target remains, however, at about 3 billion Reichsmarks; which meanslower domestic levels of consumption in certain cases, i.e., a less favourableinterpretation of the &quot; average European standard of living.&quot; The negotiations in Berlin have resulted in concessions by both sides. Nearly always, however,the Russian concessions have been substantially greater than those of the other three Powers. In the view of the British Delegation the plan represents neithera drastic nor a generous interpretation of the Potsdam Agreement, but one that can be considered to be fair.9.   There are certain points which I would draw Ministers&apos; attention,namely : (a) Food Imports.The original Soviet figure for food imports was Rm. 600 million, andtheir original balance of payments statement showed a surplus of Rm. 900million to be devoted towards occupation costs. They eventually agreed,however, that food imports should be increased if necessary to Rm. 1,500million, and that occupation costs should be postponed and only payable iffood requirements were smaller and Germany achieved a favourable trade balance. The figure of Rm. 1,500 million in the British Plan was already on the low side, since it was based on an estimate of live-stock numbers which a later census showed to be too high; the true figure would have beensomewhere in the neighbourhood of Em. 2,000 million. Since then theshortage of wheat supplies has involved us in a larger live-stock slaughterprogramme in the British Zone; consequently, additional food imports ofRm. 250 million may be necessary if the German population is to receive a calorie standard of 2,700 per day which was the pre-war average for continental Europe.(b) Steel.Although, in the new plan, steel capacity is to be reduced to 1\ million tons (as compared with the British proposal of 9 million tons), permittedproduction is to be restricted until further notice to 5 - 8 million tons. Agree-ment on this was reached in the Control Council early in January. Sub-sequently an argument developed on whether the capacity of the steel-using industries should be reduced to a level compatible with 5 - 8 million tons ofsteel production or whether, as we claimed, a margin of capacity should similarly be left for these other industries. This difference of opinion has never formally been resolved, but in the course of negotiations on individualsteel-consuming industries concessions were made by the Russians and our;objective has largely been achieved.(c) Optical and Precision Instruments and Clocks and Watches. &apos; :&apos;!The British plan provided for exports of optical and precision instru-ments and of clocks and watches to the total value of approximately Rm. 100million. The new plan provides for exports of approximately Rm. 140million. The Ministry of Supply and Aircraft Production ask that themanufacture of watches in Germany should be totally prohibited, and exportsof most kinds of optical and precision instruments prohibited also. Theresult would be to reduce total exports by about Rm. 125 million.(d) Dye-stuffs.British industry has been basing its development plans on the assump-tion that this industry would either be eliminated or restricted to the needsof the domestic market.   I understand that a deputation of the industry,[31490] B 2
which was recently received by the Parliamentary Secretary of the Boardof Trade stressed the importance of this industry as a war potential andurged that it should receive more drastic treatment. The quadripartite planprovides for a big reduction in the output of this industry as compared withthe original British plan, but still leaves a considerable margin for export.The elimination of this margin would reduce German exports by a furtherE,m. 85 million.(e) Population.The estimates in both plans are based on the assumption that Germany^ )population will amount to 66  million. When discussions first started inBerlin this figure was accepted for planning purposes, but a stipulation wasmade that productive capacity might have to be adjusted at a later date whenthe final figure for the population was available. Although no census has yetbeen taken, it now seems probable that the German population will prove tobe about 70 million, and this will entail a significant increase in import requirements, particularly of food, and a consequential increase in the amountof industrial capacity to be retained. The British representative referred tothis at the last meeting of the Control Council, when the Soviet representa-tive replied that, in his opinion, 66i million was an over-estimate and that,in any case, the plan was already too generous in its interpretation of theaverage European standard of living. Neither the American nor the french representative gave us any support.(f) Unemployment.It was estimated that, under the original British plan, Germany wouldbe left with structural unemployment of about 2^ million. But the reductions in steel and other important industries in the quadripartite plan will increase this figure probably by as much as 2 million. This will produce difficulteconomic conditions and a political atmosphere hardly conducive todemocratic re-education. On the other hand, a policy involving the removalof plant and equipment from a country which has already lost one fifth ofits territory would in any case involve considerable unemployment.10. Though there is much to criticise in the quadripartite plan, any estimateof the future economy of Germany must be largely guesswork. The likelihood isthat Germany&apos;s powers of recovery have been either underestimated or over-estimated. The margin of error is probably large, and it can be argued that suchupward adjustments as we might succeed in getting the other three Powersto accept would make relatively little difference to the ultimate pattern ofGerman economy. In the view of the British Delegation, the Soviet Governmentwould be unwilling to accept any modification of the plan; if a substantially morelenient attitude towards Germany should be adopted they feel this would require a modification of the Potsdam Agreement which could only be achieved on agovernmental level.11. During the Foreign Secretary&apos;s visit to Moscow last year, an assurance was exacted from him and Mr. Byrnes that they would do everything possibleto ensure that a plan was agreed by the Potsdam date, namely, the 2nd February,1946. It was not due to any fault of ours that no agreement was reached bythat date. The Russian anxiety for a speedy settlement is still apparent fromthe concessions they have made in the course of recent quadripartite discussions and from a note which the Foreign Secretary received only last week from theSoviet Ambassador pressing for an immediate decision. If we accept the new plan, it will remove a source of irritation which has clouded relations in berlin and might pave the way to a better understanding not only there but perhaps inother spheres as well. Against this, the acceptance of a plan which only provides a precarious balance of payments might involve us in future financial liabilities,particularly if our calculations should have so miscarried that Germany was unable to achieve her basic requirements without reducing her internal standardsbelow the subsistence level. The concessions we have been forced to accept maylead to this result. .,.12. The new plan, and indeed any plan based on the Potsdam Agreement,assumes a unitary Germany. There is already under consideration a proposal forthe separation of the Ruhr from the rest of Germany and the annexation of the saar by France. While the latter should not involve any major alteration in theplan the French can be allotted as their share of reparations any plant andequipment surplus to the economy of Germany as a whole which is located in the
Saar the separation of the Ruhr would be more fundamental. Thl&quot; Ifnlcts ofthe plan on the Ruhr, which contains the major concentration of steel and heavyengineering in Germany, will be severe and, unless the population of the area isdrastically reduced, it will undoubtedly result in severe unemployment. Whereaswithin a unitary Germany the problem could be partially solved throughabsorption of the surplus labour in other parts of the country, it would be most undesirable for a new Ruhr State to start life with a serious and virtuallyinsoluble unemployment problem. If we decide that in the interests of security the Ruhr should be separated from the rest of Germany, it is on this issue I feelthat we should try and secure the revision of the Potsdam Agreement and noton the ground that the new plan is too harsh.13.   To sum up, the questions before us are : (1) Should we unconditionally accept the plan in its present form ?(2) If not, should we seek any or all of the following modifications : (a) the retention of additional productive capacity to provide (i) for additional imports on account of an increase in populationabove the figure of 66^ million;(ii) for additional food imports resulting from the increasedslaughtering programme due to the present wheat shortage;(iii) the recovery of part, at least, of the costs of occupation.(b) the imposition, in the interests of security, of additional restric-tions on certain branches of industry, e.g., optical and precisioninstruments and dyestuffs.(3) Should we further qualify our acceptance by stipulating (c) that after the initial reparation period   Germany should beallowed to recover gradually through her own efforts, providedthat some limitation is imposed on the development of her war-important industries;(d) that the plan should be reviewed in the event of quadripartiteagreement separate the Ruhr.14. We cannot, in my view, accept the plan unconditionally but our reserva-tions need not, I suggest, extend beyond those listed in (a) (i) and (ii) and possibly(d) in the preceding paragraph.15. As regards (a) (iii) the Americans have already declared against such apolicy though they intend to keep their claim alive and treat it as a charge against any favourable trade balance that Germany may eventually have. The russians have also agreed to defer their claim see paragraph 9 (a).16. As regards (6), however justifiable these additional measures might be in themselves, their effect would be to reduce Germany&apos;s exports by 200 million reichs-marks. They would not sensibly increase the overall degree of security resultingfrom the cumulative effect of the extensive industrial disarmament measures already in the plan.17. As regards (c), the Economic Principles of the Potsdam Agreement,which restrict Germany&apos;s living standards to a level not exceeding that, of continental Europe, are related specifically to the &quot;Initial Control Period.&quot;This, I think, would justify us in insisting at a later date that Germany&apos;standard of living should not be held down indefinitely.18. As regards (d), a reservation on these lines might make any subsequentproposal for the separation of the Ruhr unpalatable to the Russians, and ministers may feel that it would be premature to make such, a reservation before our Rub rpolicy is decided.J.
