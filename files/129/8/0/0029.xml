(46) 129.th March, 1946.Copy No. J ^cabinet.ERECTION AND MAINTENANCE OF A BROADCASTING station at SINGAPORE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I wish to commend to my colleagues a project for the erection andmaintenance of a Broadcasting Station at Singapore, in order to ensure that theBritish Voice is heard throughout all the countries of the Far East at sufficient strength to attract and hold audiences in all those countries.A. Summary of Recommendations.I recommend that i(a) A British Broadcasting Station should be erected as soon as possible at singapore; it should be built, if possible, on the Jurong Civil Siteon Singapore Island;(b) It should consist of  four high-powered transmitters, composed  asfollows : (i) Three 100-K.W. transmitters already held by the Ministry ofInformation;(ii) One 50-K.W. R.C.A. transmitter now in Singapore;(c) It should have thirteen frequencies to carry out its work effectively;(a) A telecommunications link between London and Singapore via EastAfrica should be set up;(e) A receiving station, which could be conveniently sited on the MalayanMainland, should be established as soon as possible at a reasonabledistance from the transmitting station.B. Why the Voice of Britain must be heard in the Far East.All the nations of the Far East hate Japan, but all derived satisfaction fromthe ability of an Asiatic Power to beat the West at its own game. Of the WesternPmvers who suffered at the hands of Japan, Britain appeared to fare the worst.2. Japan everywhere fanned existing or nascent nationalisms by her sloganof &quot;Asia for the Asiatics.&quot; Although the inhabitants of territories occupiedby Japan know this meant &apos;&apos; Asia for the Japanese,&apos;&apos; they are none the less filledwith enthusiasm for the real thing. Further, the inhabitants of certain colonial territories enjoyed under the Japanese at least the trappings of independence.3. All Asiatic countries are particularly susceptible to the appeal of power.To them the United States appear to have played the dominant part in the defeat of Japan and thus in their liberation. All countries of the Far East know that america is against what it calls &quot; imperialism,&quot; and inhabitants of colonial territories know that American opinion favours their freedom.4. Russia also appears to them to have emerged triumphant from thestruggle. All countries of the Far East have their Communist parties sympatheticJ-o Russia, some of which played a role in the defeat of Japan. Russia, too, isknown to be against the colonial policies of others.5.   The loss to the Japanese of Hong Kong, Malaya and Burma meant theeclipse for a space of Britain as a power factor.   When Britain did return as&amp; victor, she appeared to follow at the heels of a triumphant United States.13233   [31551]
6. Therefore to the Far Eastern world the United States and Russia appearthe dominant Powers and they are known to be emotionally opposed to much of thepolicy as popularly conceived of the third world Power Britain in the Far East7. All countries in the Far East are politically in a state of change and thusopen to the influence of the political ideologies of others.8. All are open to influence by wireless. In Japan and Java the extent oflistening is similar to that prevailing in Europe, but in all countries in the far east the well-to-do aspire to the possession of a wireless set. Illiteracy in many areas increases the importance of the spoken word and much communal listeningprevails. Wireless represents to-day the only means of reaching the broad masses of the people.9. The United States and Russia are well aware of this. During the warthe United States Office of War Information built up a total Far East programmeof thirty hours a day using English, Standard Chinese (Kuoyu), JapaneseSiamese, Burmese, Annamite and Malay, in addition to English, French and dutch. The United States are still operating fifteen hours a day, while inaddition they are in complete control of the entire Japanese internal and externalbroadcasting system. Russia and China initiate broadcasts for the whole area.The French operate the most powerful station in the Far East at Saigon, whilethe Government of India plan elaborate projection of India over the whole area.10. It is clear therefore that the British Voice must be heard constantlythroughout the Far East (a) to ensure that Britain plays an effective role inFar Eastern affairs as a corrective to the growing and competing interests of theUnited States and U.S.S.R.; (b) to strengthen the bonds between its memberpeoples there and the Mother Country; (c) to present a correct picture of Britishideas and aspirations and to prevent the growth of anti-British sentiment as theresult of growing nationalism in the area, both in British territories and else-where; (d) to back up the work of Press Attaches and to serve the needs ofBritish communities throughout the area; and (e) to present a picture of Britishindustrial achievement and to promote in the broadest sense British commercial interests in an export market of such vital importance.C. What is now being done to make the Voice of Britain heard in the Far East.The need for a British Broadcasting Station tomcover the whole area was recognised as far back as 1938, but the Malaya Broadcasting Corporation set upfor that purpose had barely started its work when Singapore fell in 1942.2. From 1942 to 1945 broadcasts to the Far East were carried out from new Delhi in conjunction with All-India Radio over a total at one time of asmuch as 15^ hours a day. To meet the operational needs of South-East AsiaCommand five hours a day in Far Eastern languages were carried out fromColombo. In addition, by agreement with the United States Government, two hours&apos; broadcasts a day were undertaken from San Francisco. The B.B.C. carriedout four hours&apos; broadcasting a day from London in Far Eastern languages.3. With the end of the war against Japan, it was found necessary to closedown the broadcasts from New Delhi, which had only been tolerated from Indiansoil as a wartime necessity. The dollar position forced the termination of broad-casting from San Francisco. But broadcasts in English only on one transmittercontinue for army welfare purposes from Colombo. Broadcasts on a modest scaleon low-powered transmitters are in operation from Singapore to meet the require-ments of the Supreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia. The B.B.C.&apos;s four hours a day from London continue. In addition the Burmese Government andthe British Military Administration in Malaya operate broadcasts for their territories only from Rangoon and Singapore.4. Of these broadcasts those from Singapore are heard fairly effectively inthe countries of South-East Asia (Siam, French Indo-China, and parts ofNetherlands East Indies). The B.B.C.&apos;s broadcasts can be heard by those deter-mined to make the effort to do so, but because of the limitations of long-distancetransmission they cannot attract an audience or hold their own with local trans-missions. The B.B.C.&apos;s Standard Chinese (Kuoyu), Siamese and Japanesetransmissions are, temporarily, relayed at good strength by All-India Radio by agoodwill arrangement. In addition their Japanese programmes are not at present being relayed over medium wave into Japan proper except temporarily and
ineffectually through the United States relay station at Saipan. The trans-missions of the Government of Burma and the British Military administration in Jialaya are solely for the inhabitants of their own territories.5. This means that no effective and closely co-ordinated Voice of Britain isheard over all the peak listening periods in the Far East. At present only those already determined to listen to British broadcasts and equipped with first-classshort-wave sets would make the effort to do so.n, What must be done to ensure that the Voice of Britain is heard at sufficient strength to attract and hold in all the countries in the Far East.The Voice of Britain should originate from London at sufficient strength tohold its own with local broadcasts. The inhabitants of the Far East are notinterested in a British Voice from a British colony; it should come from the centre0f British life.2. For similar reasons a good proportion of the Voice of Britain shouldbe in English; it would thus have an authentic ring, which no broadcastsspecially prepared for another country in its own language can attain. More-over, we have an obvious advantage in spreading a knowledge of English andmeeting a widespread desire to hear spoken English onthe part of students, &amp;c,in the Far East. Objective news bulletins (such as made the European reputation-tion of the B.B.C.) and a proportion of the output must be in the followinglanguages : Standard Chinese (Kuoyu), the Chinese dialects of Cantonese andHokkien, Japanese, Siamese, Annamese (Tonkinese and Cochin-Chinese) (for french Indo-China), Indonesian Malay (for Netherlands East Indies), Malay andBurmese, in addition to French and Dutch,3. Concentration on achieving this output from London (by the B.B.C.)would ensure co-ordination, simplify policy control and place at the disposal ofthose concerned the vast experience of the B.B.C. organisation. In addition itwould avoid dispersal of staff and achieve a concentration of experts few in numbers and hard to obtain.4. In wartime and when conducting political warfare and propaganda tothe Far East it was vital that broadcasts should be undertaken in an orientalatmosphere, since it was necessary to struggle to make our broadcasts appear aslike those of the countries to which they were directed as possible. The normalpeacetime British Voice should, however, be frankly British. Further, the Asiaticstaff required could be frequently changed to ensure that their idiom conformedto the frequently changing practice of the Far East.5. But broadcasts direct from England cannot be made more audible than is at present the case in the Far East, and the quality of their reception variesaccording to the season and the time. Therefore programmes from england should be taken by a high-grade telecommunications link to some favourable and central site in the Far East and broadcast from there to whole Far East.6. Colombo, New Delhi and Singapore have the required technicalconditions in that order of suitability. But political conditions in Ceylon maynot remain favourable to British as opposed to Ceylonese transmissions from the soil of Ceylon, while political considerations would certainly render such a project from Delhi impracticable.7. For these reasons Singapore would seem the most favourable site for aBritish broadcasting station to relay the British Voice to the whole of the far east. In order to reach as effectively as desired all the countries in the Far East,the British Broadcasting Station at Singapore would have to be composed of four high-powered short-wave transmitters, which would then be in a positionto operate a schedule on the principles stated below. Allowance for the erectionat Singapore of a broadcasting station of this magnitude has been made indrawing up the composite plan for broadcasting installations at Singapore being prepared by the Imperial Communications Committee.8. The B.B.C. output in the twelve requisite languages would be carried on one programme by the telecommunications link. According to the best technicaladvice it will be necessary to use four broadcast transmitters in order to achieve the desired result, namely to enable the foreign language transmissions to be aimed at their destination simultaneously with English programmes destined forareas for which no foreign language transmission is at the moment being broad-cast.  Thus, appropriate B.B.C. English transmissions would be carried in all
directions by all the transmitters in Singapore. The other language trans-missions would only be beamed in the appropriate direction. The remainingtime on the different transmitters would be taken up by broadcasts initiated in singapore in English of an educational, cultural or entertainment value (sincemusic and entertainment, due to the limitations inherent in short-wave broad-casting, must in any case be initiated in Singapore if they are to compare favourably with the programmes of local stations). These broadcasts initiatedin Singapore would themselves be largely composed of transcriptions andgramophone records flown there from London. By this method the countries of theEar East would receive at their respective peak listening periods transmissionsin their own language and in English originating direct from London, supple-mented by more English programmes originated in Singapore but prepared frommaterial supplied from London.9. A broadcasting and relay station of this kind would, however, take atleast one year to erect. Until such time as it could be in operation the existing british broadcasts outlined above would be maintained.10. The provision of frequencies (wavelengths) will be a difficult problem.The number of frequencies which, by international agreement at the next world conference, will be available for short-wave broadcasting will be strictly limited and frequencies for this project will have to be provided out of the limited number which will be available to this country, probably at the expense of other british short-wave overseas services.E. It is difficult to make an exact estimate of the capital cost of the project.I propose that the cost of this project should be borne on the Foreign Office and colonial Office votes in proportions to be determined. Assuming that thematerial already on the spot can be used, it is calculated that the following willbe incurred:  (i) Approximate Capital Expenditure at Singapore      ...      535,000(ii) Approximate annual Recurrent Costs   ...      ...      ...      165,000(iii) Approximate annual cost of telecommunications link        30,000(iv) Approximate annual cost of increased B.B.C. output...      103,000E.
