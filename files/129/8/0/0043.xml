This was perhaps inevitable in the openingSession of a new Parliament, following a chance of Government,in July,  but,  if we are to pat through the programme oflegislation which we have undertaken to pass in this parliament, we must make sure that in future Sessions we make good use of the period between November and Easter - andparticularly the weeks before Christmas - in which the Houseof Commons can devote most time to legislation.2. With this in view the Prime Minister invited me to preside over a Committee composed of:-The Lord Privy seal the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, andThe Chief whip to select the major Bills for next Session on whichpreparatory work could be started early in the year, withoutprejudice to the subsequent construction of a completelegislative programme for the Session or to the finalcontent of the King&apos;s Speech.3. We have consulted with our colleagues and with parliamentary Counsel,  and cur conclusions are as follows--(a) The major Bills which should be got ready for introduction at the beginning of the 19^6-47Session are:-Exchange ControlNational Health Service (Scotland)Town and Country Planning (Development Rights)Companies Acts AmendmentAgricultural WagesRiver BoardsCriminal JusticeLocal Government (Scotland) Consolidation.The first three and the last of these originallyformed part of the Programme for the current session but have had to be postponed.

In drawing up this list we have confined ourselves to major measures which could be started between thebeginning of the Session and Easter.      We recognise thatthe legislative programme will also include a considerablenumber of smaller Bills,  some of which will be no lessnecessary than the major Bills in cur list.      There may also be room for one additional major Bill which cannotcome forward until later in the Session.      Our present purpose is, however, to identify the major measures onwhich work should be started soon if we are to make thebest use of Parliamentary time in the earlier part of the session.      These measures will in themselves provide a heavy programme for a Session which will in any event beshorter than the current Session.5. We invite the Cabinet:-(a) To agree that the Bills listed in paragraph above shall form the main element in the government&apos;s legislative programme in theearlier part of next Session.(b) To give a ruling that during the next six months the preparation of these Bills shall be a first charge on the time at the disposal ofParliamentary Counsel after he has met thedemands cf the current Session&apos;s legislation.(c) To invite the Legislation Committee, who alreadycarry out a monthly review of the programme for the current Session, to superintend theprogress of these preparations for next Session.6.
