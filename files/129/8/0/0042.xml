rHlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1946.SEC1UT.CP. (46) 142.&amp;h April, 1946.Copy No.CABINET.NEW TOWNS BILL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Town and Country Planning.Introduction.1. The Lord President&apos;s Committee at their meeting on the 1st March(L.P. (46) 8th Meeting, Minute 5), invited us to submit a draft Bill on New Townsas soon as possible. The draft of such a Bill is now submitted, with a view to its introduction, if it is approved, before Easter. This will necessitate its approval by the Cabinet on the 15th April.It has already been announced that it is the policy of the Government tocarry out a programme for the planned dispersal of a substantial portion of thepopulation of London to areas situated some 20 to 50 miles away, and there tocreate homes and work for most of the people so moved in new towns or in existingsmall towns greatly extended. The need for such a policy of decentralisation,though greatest in London, is also acute in the case of many large towns through-out Britain, where the population is very congested. Manchester, Leeds,Liverpool, Plymouth and Glasgow are examples. Moreover, the creation of anew town may be desirable to gather together into a single economically balancedurban unit a number of small scattered communities which have in the past beendependent on a single industry or on natural local resources now in decline.Instances are to be found in certain of the mining communities of Durham.General Structure.2. The Bill provides for the designation of an area as a site for a newtown, and an extension of an existing town is covered by definition. In eithertype of case, that of the entirely new town or that of the greatly extended existingtown a Government-financed public corporation will be set up, normally for eachtown, exceptionally for two or more towns. The local authorities and statutory undertakers in the area will normally continue to exercise their functions andwhen the appropriate stage in the development has been reached the corporation will be wound up and its assets and liabilities handed over to the area localauthority on terms to be prescribed. The powers proposed for the development corporation have necessarily to be very wide if the Corporations are effectively to discharge their functions. These powers, some of which are referred to inmore detail below, include a power to acquire, hold, manage and dispose of land,a power themselves to undertake building development in fact to act as estatedevelopers on a large scale to contribute towards the cost of providing public services and to provide such services themselves where this is the only way ofobtaining them. Certain of these points are dealt with more fully in subsequentparagraphs.The Interim Reith Report (Cmd. 6759).3. In so framing the Bill we have followed most of the main recommenda-tions of the Interim Report (a copy of which is attached), recently made by theCommittee appointed by us under the Chairmanship of Lord Reith. The Com-mittee have also now submitted a second Interim Report, which we also follow in the main. We draw attention, however, to the following points of divergencefrom the recommendations in the first Report:- (a) The Report recommends that provision should be made also for localauthority sponsored Corporations. We have rejected this recom-mendation because it is very doubtful how far, in fact, this proposal has any general support throughout the local authority world andeven more doubtful how far in. any particular instance the effective[31623] B
co-operation of all the local authorities concerned could be relied upon.Moreover, the problems of finance and control that would necessarily be raised by employing as the agency and financing such a corporation of local authorities would be difficult and embarrassing.(b) We have also rejected the recommendation that in certain cases ai\authorised association under the Town and Country Planning Act.1932, might be an appropriate agent. It would not be desirable to entrust such a task to a purely commercial concern, a difficulty whichthe Reith Committee seek to avoid by an elaborate series of safe-guards. On the other hand, it would be difficult in practice to confineparticipation to organisations whose objects are primarily philan-thropic rather than commercial, and who might for that reason be acceptable. Moreover, the task is, in our view, too big for any privateorganisation.(c) We have not made provision for a Central Advisory Commission to advise the Secretary of State and the Minister and the individual Corpora-tions on their work in the establishment of the New Towns. Powerto appoint an advisory committee, if this were found necessary or desirable, already exists.Planning Control.4. The provisions of Clause 3 of the Bill which relate to planning controlhave been drafted so as to avoid any express amendment of existing planninglegislation. The clause provides that the Corporation must submit proposals tothe Minister or Secretary of State for approval after consultation with the local planning Authority. It further provides that the Minister or Secretary of state may make a special interim development order, a power which they already possess under the 1932 Acts, which will have the effect of taking interim develop-ment control out of the hands of the Interim Development Authority so far asthe area of the new town is concerned. So far as development by the Corporationitself is concerned, this will be in accordance with the proposals already approvedby the Minister or Secretary of State; while development by private persons willbe controlled by conditions imposed by the Corporation after consultation withthe Local Planning Authority. Such development is also subject to the approvalof the Minister or Secretary of State. Thus, the Local Planning Authority, whileexercising no direct control, will be consulted on those matters which it, in fact,controls under the existing law.Further, the functions of the Joint Planning Committee are left undisturbed,since they will be consulted before approval is given to the Corporation^ plans for developing the area, and the Minister or Secretary of State, when a planningscheme is submitted to him by the Joint Committee for approval, will, of course,see that the proposals are in harmony with the development to be carried out bythe Corporation.Housing.5. In practice and from a financial standpoint the largest single element in the work of the Development Corporations will undoubtedly be the provisionof new houses (Clause 8) and here three courses are open to them (a) A Corporation may dispose of land in the new town to any localauthority who may themselves build houses thereon making the usualrates contribution and receiving the usual Exchequer grant.(b) The Corporation, being a housing association within the meaning of theHousing Acts, may itself build houses for the working classes anditself receive the appropriate Exchequer subsidy via the localauthority with whom it has an arrangement. The local authority would be expected to pay an agreed amount for an agreed period byway of rates contribution in consideration of receiving the right to nominate for an agreed number of years the tenants of those houses.(c) The Corporation may build houses itself without entering into any agree-ment with a local authority, in which case it would receive theExchequer subsidy direct in appropriate cases. In such cases, in sofar as Exchequer subsidy had been payable, it would on the dissolution of the Corporation and within the normal term be payable thereafter to the local authority to whom the property of the Corporation was transferred.The Bill will provide (Clause 5) that in England and Wales the development corporation shall not have power, except with the consent of the Minister, to
-    215transfer the freehold of land or to grant a lease for more than 99 years. TheLondon County Council are expected to press for the right to take the freeholdwhere they build. It is considered that this should be resisted. Such a concession could not be limited to the London County Council and in any case it is undesirable in England and Wales that large areas in the new towns shouldbe in the freehold of an outside authority. In Scotland provisions restricting the disposal of land to disposal by way of lease only would be inappropriate and,following the precedent of Section 18 of the town and Country Planning(Scotland) Act, 1945, the Bill in its application to Scotland will enable theDevelopment Corporation to dispose of land by way of sale or feu.Public Services.6. To the extent that this is practicable and we contemplate that this will almost invariably be the case the usual public and public utility services will beprovided throughout the area of the new town by the body already responsible andcompetent in the area, Le., the appropriate local authorities for, e.g., Health,Education, Roads, Water or Sewerage and the appropriate statutory undertakersfor, e.g., gas and electricity. The Corporation is empowered (Clause 11) tocontribute towards the cost of providing such services in the area of the newtown, and (Clause 2 (3)), where such services are not otherwise obtainable, toprovide them itself. In certain cases it will be necessary for the Corporation toprovide the major part of the capital cost, but it will be possible to provide forreimbursement by the local authority of an appropriate part of the cost. Inmaking contributions to public utilities the Corporation will follow the practicethat is normal in the case of the ordinary private development company.Railways.7. Special consideration of the railway problem is necessary. Nationalisa-tion will alter the position in certain respects, but the question of the extent towhich the railways should be assisted financially to make the necessary provision will arise. As stated in the previous paragraph, the Bill will enable the corporations to make a contribution and if agreement is not reached the matter is referable to an independent tribunal. The problem will be most acute in theGreater London area, where it will be urged that if the railways hadbeen allowedto develop in the orthodox way the development could have been carried out at less cost. Whatever the form of the development, the railways are, we under-stand, now faced with the need for heavy capital expenditure in the comingyears, since on their own showing they have little unused capacity either inrolling stock or permanent way. Moreover, although the railway companies arenot yet entirely convinced, we are satisfied that the independent new town ought not to create&apos; a heavy demand for facilities for daily travel, and that any alternative form of development would place no less burden upon the railways.It may therefore be found that none of the additional expenditure which therailways have to face is properly attributable to the creation of new towns, butwe think that it is right to leave the problem to be settled, as the Bill provides, by arbitration.Winding Up.8. Provision is made in the Bill (Clause 14) for the winding up in dueseason probably after a life of some ten years of the Corporations, and for thetransfer of all the then existing assets to the appropriate local authority. this transfer will, it is provided, be after prior consultation with the authority but will not require the authority&apos;s agreement.Provision is also made for the transfer by the Corporation at any time during their existence with the consent of the Minister and the Treasury of any partof the Corporation^ undertaking or property to the appropriate local authority or statutory undertaker.In the case of winding up and final transfer this will be by Ministerial orderincorporating terms in which the Treasurv have concurred, and will be subjectto Parliamentary control.Finance.9. The financial burden of establishing the new towns will rest on theExchequer and expenditure will.be subject to the usual controls by the Minister,by,the Treasury, and by Parliament. Current expenditure of the Corporationswill be met from payments by the Minister out of monies voted by parliament by way of grants and charged to Departmental vote.   Corporations will not have[31623] b 2
outside borrowing powers and capital expenditure will be met by them out of advances by way of loan. They will be drawn from the Consolidated Fund andwill be made by the Secretary of State or the Minister with the consent of theTreasury.10. A close estimate of the amount of loan capital required is not possible.Much depends on the future trend of prices and on the proportion of the develop-ment which will be undertaken by private enterprise. We consider, however,that the cost to public funds of the development of a new town of average size,involving the immigration of 50,000 persons, will be of the order of  19 millions,spread fairly even over the period after the first two years. Of this total  l5imillions will be borne by the Corporation and  3^ millions by the local authorities,who in turn may receive, say,  1^ millions by way of ordinary grant for, e.g.,roads and schools. The total does not include anything by way of contributionto the railways and electricity ancl gas undertakings.11. The full programme contemplates the creation of some thirteen new towns for London (in the main major extensions of existing small towns), and seven in the rest of England and Wales for centres such as Manchester, Leeds,Liverpool, possibly Plymouth, and in Durham. In Scotland there will be sixto eight, three or four of which will be smallish towns, with populations of10,000 to 15,000. The whole projected programme will provide in all for amigration of just over 1 million people, of whom about half would come fromthe Greater London area. As Ministers are aware, provisional selection of sites for London is already well advanced, and it is proposed to open discussion withthe provincial towns after Easter. The total public loan capital involved may therefore be ultimately of the order of  380 millions. This will, however, bespread over ten years or more, and we have therefore thought it right to seekauthority only for sufficient capital to ensure the successful launching of thescheme. According, the Bill asks for  100 millions only, and as the schemedevelops further Parliamentary authority will have to be sought, possibly in, say,five years&apos; time. This figure is provisional and has not yet been agreed withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer.12. No accurate estimate of the annual grant aid is possible. annual average expenses of management for each Corporation may be of the order of 20,000. The other main items of expenditure will be upon steadily increasingloan charges and to meet the deficit due to the need to let working-class housesat normal rents without any assistance by way of a rates contribution. In theearly years there will be some revenue from standing property and farm rents,and later, as the development proceeds, from ground rents. Annual grant aidduring the first five years may average  30,000- 40,000 for each new town. Afterthe fifth year the financial position will depend mainly on the appreciation of central values which the development ought to produce.13. In considering these figures it is necessary to bear in mind that only asmall fraction of the loan capital required from public funds is properlyattributable to the creation of new towns. Even if allowance is made for thepossibility that the capital which the Corporation needs to provide middle-classhouses, and some of the factories and shops, would be provided by private enter-prise if they were built elsewhere, it is still the case that 80 per cent, of the total would have to be provided even if no new towns were created. Moreover, if itcan be assumed that local authorities elsewhere would also themselves build thenecessary middle-class houses, factories and shops, the 80 per cent, becomes 90 percent., and the total public loan capital property attributable to the creation ofthe new towns can be put at  38 millions spread over, say, ten to fifteen years.It has to be borne in mind also that under present law there is a heavy saving in land costs, viz., less than  500,000 for a town like Stevenage, as comparedwith a possible  2 millions to  3 millions or more for the necessary fringe land which would otherwise have been needed, or many times that amount whereexpensive central land has to be used. In this last case there will also be a bigsaving in housing subsidy. The position will be different after the passing of theDevelopment Rights Bill, since all land will be purchasable at existing use. ;value,but even then fringe land is likely still to be more costly than country land.14. We ask authority to introduce the Bill, subject to scrutiny by theLegislation Committee, with a view to its being given a second reading as soonas possible after the Easter recess..i J.

NEW  TOWNS  COMMITTEE-      217Interim Report on Choice of agency to:The Right Hon. Lewis Silkin, M.P.,Minister of Town and Country Planning.The Right Hon. Joseph Westwood, M.P.,Secretary of State for Scotland.We were appointed on 19th October, 1945, with terms of reference as setout below, and we now present an Interim Report as follows:  A. introduction. (1) The twin evils of slums and overcrowding date mainly from theearly years of the last century. They have their roots in the unregulatedand excessive growth of towns during a period when the health of the people,no less than their spiritual and social well-being, were sacrificed to industrialprogress. Men must live near their work. Yet only in recent years hascome a full realisation that the solution of the many problems to which theseevils give rise, to say nothing of the spoliation of the countryside by ill-considered building, is by setting some limit to the haphazard sprawl of our existing cities and by providing in new towns, wisely sited and skilfullyplanned, a proper balance between housing and industry.(2) It is no part of our duty to discuss the merits of new towns in relationto the alleged advantages of continued suburban development. This issue was considered at length by the Royal Commission on the Distribution of theIndustrial Population, under the chairmanship of Sir Montague Barlow.*Our duty, which lies in a narrower field, is clearly defined by our terms ofreference:  &quot; To consider the general questions of the establishment, development,organisation and administration that will arise in the promotion of new towns in furtherance of a policy of planned decentralisation from con-gested urban areas; and in accordance therewith to suggest guidingprinciples on which such Towns should be established and developed asself-contained and balanced communities for work and living.&quot;(3) The last words are significant. New towns that are to be developed as &quot;self-contained and balanced communities &quot; are the antithesis of thedormitory suburb. One of their primary purposes is to provide for the over-spill of industry and population as the congested areas of our great citiesare cleared and rebuilt at lower densities; another is to regroup persons from areas of diminishing population and from small scattered communities,whose major industry is declining, and to rehouse them, not merely with greater amenities, but in proper relation to newly established industries.(4) Such towns are sometimes described as &quot; satellite towns &quot;; this termhas been used in different senses and we purposely avoid it. In this documentwe speak throughout of &apos;&apos; new towns &apos;&apos;. They may be of two types: theymay be towns that are entirely new, planned and built where previously therewas only a scattered and rural population; or they may be major extensions of existing small towns, the original community being regarded as a nucleusto be expanded.     We have been specially asked to regard our terms of48S73* Cmd. 6153.
reference as including new towns of both these kinds. We would add that wehave received a considerable volume of evidence upon the advantages to be gained by making relatively small additions to medium-sized towns. But,permissible as this may ibe in some cases, it is fraught with danger, and,in any event, the resultant unit cannot properly foe regarded as a new townwithin the scope of our inquiry.(5) We have been asked to make recommendations, as rapidly as possible,about the appropriate &quot; agency &quot;. By this is meant the body of persons to be charged with the responsibility for developing the land and the sufose-quent estate management. In this connection we have assumed throughoutthat the agency, whatever fonm it may take, will so far as possible retain the ownership (whether as freeholder, feuar or first lessee) of the whole site;will foe responsible for the plan; and will secure its execution by the granting of leases with suitable covenants. A large part of the founding development will undoubtedly be undertaken by private persons, public utility enterprise and municipal authorities in such proportions as local conditions may demand.The extent to which the agency will itself erect buildings will also vary asbetween one town and another. We have also assumed that, in order to ensuresatisfactory conditions in the early stages, the agency may itself provide, certainnecessary services, to be taken over later foy the local authority.(6) This, then, is the subject of the Interim Report which follows. Wehave also&apos; thought fit to include herein certain recommendations about finance,location of industry, and legislation which we believe to be urgent. beyond this, we have reserved for a later report the detailed discussion of the many problems which must inevitably arise from any attempt to translate the con-ception of new towns into practical reality.(7) In making such an attempt we are fully sensible of the magnitude of the responsibility placed upon us, which far exceeds the mere devising ofmachinery for the ordered laying of bricks and mortar. It is not enough in our handiwork to avoid the mistakes and omissions of the past. our responsibility, as we see it, is rather to conduct an essay in civilisation, byseizing an opportunity to design, evolve and carry into execution for thebenefit of coming generations the means for a happy and gracious way of life.It is in that spirit that we approach our task.B. Agency2. Size of towns(1) A new town must provide shopping, recreation, and other business and social facilities, not only for its own citizens but for people from the surrounding area. The population beyond fhe town boundaries will varygreatly between one town and another, a factor which in itself renders ineffective-tive any attempt at uniformity of size.(2) There is a minimum size for a new town below which it ceases to foea practical proposition as a balanced industrial unit. As its size increases the social facilities can be enlarged proportionately; in particular, the facili-ties for education. But beyond a certain point the appropriate balance between industry and housing is hard to maintain, the internal distancesbecame too great, the open country is too remote from the centre, and the sense of corporate living and responsibility is lost.(3) It is therefore impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule as to theoptimum size of a new town. This must depend in every case upon localconditions. But, taking all these factors into account, a preliminary studyindicates as a general guide a range from 20,000 to 60,000 of population in the built-up area, subject to exceptions either way.
(i) From -whatever source the initiation of new town schemes may arise,we recommend that the decision as to their situation and boundaries must restfinally with the Government.(2) It is not to be expected that complete sites of the size required willbe purchasable iby free negotiation. It is necessary, therefore, that theGovernment shall have full powers for compulsory purchase of approvedsites on behalf of the agencies appointed to hold and develop them.(3) We recommend that the site acquired should include the whole of theland within the proposed built-up area and a surrounding belt of appropriatedepth of the order, on average, of three-quarters of a mile. The object isto enable the agency satisfactorily to rearrange the farm tenancies withinthe area of ownership, and to preclude outside exploitation of the increasedland values caused by the expenditure on development. This surroundingbelt is not, however, intended to include the whole of the green belt areaover which planning control should be exercised.4. Variety of agencies(1) We have thought it desirable to consider every practicable type ofagency, to obtain evidence from likely bodies, and to give to each theopportunity of saying whether they felt able and willing to undertake thework. And although, as will be seen, we consider one particular type ofagency to have, in general, decided advantages over others, we do not desire to exclude certain other types which, in special circumstances, maybe found suitable.(2) We have also taken into consideration the fact that there might bepositive advantage in a diversity of types of agency. It must be rememberedalso that the tasks to be undertaken will vary considerably in magnitude;moreover, local authorities vary in strength, enterprise and degree of pre-occupation with other duties. We also felt that private enterprise shouldbe as fully considered as any form of public enterprise.5. Types of agency examined the possible types of agency we have examined in detail are:  (1) a single local authority able and willing to undertake the task andhaving the site of the new town wholly in its area;(2) a local authority faced with the need for redevelopment involvingdisplacement of population, able and willing to develop as land-owner in another area, the authority for which, whether or not it co-operates inthe development, is agreeable to such a course;(3) two or more dispersing local authorities able and willing jointly todevelop the new town as in sub-para. (2) above;(4) a limited liability company (i.e. ordinary commercial enterprise);(5) an authorised association;(6) a housing association;(7) a government sponsored public corporation financed by theExchequer;(8) a similar corporation sponsored by one or more local authorities.6. Definitions(1) In this report the term &quot; local authority &quot; means: in England andWales, a council of a county, of a county borough, of a non-county borough,or of an urban or rural district; in Scotland, a council of a county, of a county of a city, or of a large or small burgh.48873 A 3
(2) An &quot; authorised association &quot; means a foody of the kind defined bySection 35 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932, as &quot; any society,company or body of persons approved by the Minister whose objects includethe promotion, formation, or management of garden cities and the erection,improvement or management of buildings for the working classes and others,and which does not trade for profit or whose constitution forbids the issueof any share or loan capital with interest or dividend exceeding the rate forthe time being fixed by the Treasury &quot;. The corresponding provision inScotland is Section 34 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act,1932.(3) A &quot; housing association &quot; is defined by Section 188 of the housing act, 1936, as a society, body of trustees or company established for thepurpose of, or amongst whose objects or powers are included those of, con-structing, improving or managing or facilitating or encouraging the construc-tion or improvement of, houses for the working classes, being a society, bodyof trustees or company who do not trade for profit or whose constitutionor rules prohibit the issue of any capital with interest or dividend exceeding the rate for the time being prescribed by the Treasury, whether with or without differentiation as between share and loan capital&quot;; and its powersderive from Sections 93 to 96 of that Act. The corresponding provisions inScotland are&apos;Sections 25 to 29 of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1935.(4) The term &quot; public corporation &quot; as used in this report means a bodyestablished under statute or by Royal Charter for a specific public purpose,the management of which is conducted not by a minister but by a board of governors appointed by the Government. Public corporations for this pur-pose may ibe of two kinds. The first, which we call a government sponsoredcorporation, would be financed by the Exchequer or the Public Works LoanBoard. The second, which we call a local authority sponsored corporation,would be financed by the interested local authorities who should therefore have the right to nominate some of the members of the governing body. Pro-posals as to the constitution and powers of both kinds of public corporation will be found in paragraph 10.7. Evidence received(1) Appendix 1 contains a list of the associations of local authorities inEngland and Wales and in Scotland from whose representatives evidence was taken, and with most of whom the problems were discussed. As therehad not been sufficient time for most of the representatives to consult their members, many of them asked that their views should not be regarded asnecessarily expressing the official views of their associations.(2) Appendix 2 lists the associations of various classes of private enter-prise, with whose representatives we had similar discussions, subject to thesame understanding.(3) In order more thoroughly to explore the possibilities for the employmentof private enterprise, we examined representatives of certain individual companies, who either had expressed interest or who, we thought, were likelyto be interested. In each case the discussion was based on the assumptionthat the company concerned, if selected as the agency for a new town, woufdenjoy the same priorities for labour and material as any other type of agency.t.8. Survey of evidence(1) Local authorities(i) We have given full consideration to the views and claims of localauthorities, having in inind their experience in housing development and provision of amenities, and their duties and responsibilities as the elected representatives of local communities.
(ii) There was little divergence between the evidence received from england and Wales and from Scotland.(iii) The representatives of some large cities were, in general, indisposedto consider functioning as land-owners and developers in anotherauthority&apos;s area, although, in our opinion, there are advantages in such acourse. They made it clear that they were anxious to retain their popula-tions, rehoused if necessary, within their existing or extended boundaries.In this case they would expect to carry out the development required, and considered themselves competent to do so.(iv) The main objection to this method is that if the development weresited sufficiently far out to constitute a new town, within our terms ofreference, substantial extensions of the boundaries of the original city wouldbe required, covering not o*idy the new /town but a very considerable areaof intervening green belt land. This, beyond question, would be strongly opposed by county and district councils. Alternatively, the effort to sitethe new development in a situation which would permit of boundary exten-sion would increase the area of the conurbations and make it difficult toprevent the new development from becoming a mere dormitory settlement,thus perpetuating the suburban sprawl which it is a major purpose of modern planning to stop.(v) There was an almost unanimous feeling among these witnesses that,apart from London and special cases such as East Scotland where a fewnew communities are needed for new coalfields, the extension of existingsmall towns was preferable to the building of entirely new towns. Thisview was held especially strongly by local authorities which represent smalltowns or have small towns in their areas.(vi) In support of this contention was urged the value of establishedtradition and the existence of community buildings and services. We doubt,however, whether the scale of dispersal implied in government policy, withall its consequences, has been fully appreciated. In our view, local traditionwould be largely submerged and existing services overburdened by the size of the proposed extensions. And, moreover, the layout of the existing buildings might be found to be a considerable handicap.(vii) Representatives of county councils and of councils of small townsand districts claimed that some of them, either separately or jointly, wouldbe willing to undertake extensions of existing small towns, and urgedthat this method should be given sympathetic consideration. We examinedwitnesses as to the capacity of their local authorities to carry out suchextensions, but obtained no clear guidance on this point. There is a great difference between handling an extension relatively small in relation to thepresent size of the community, and an extension which involves a radicalalteration of scale. This was a point which, it appeared to us, was not always appreciated.(viii) Representatives of county councils pointed out that these had agreater financial and executive strength than had the councils of minorauthorities in their areas; and, although, in England and Wales, they areat present neither housing nor planning authorities, some representativesconsidered that, given the necessary powers, county councils could carryout substantial extensions to towns in their areas. Generally, they wouldbe prepared to work in co-operation with the borough or district council.If such joint action were to be authorised, solutions would have to befound to the difficult problems of devising appropriate administrative machinery, as well as of the allocation of financial responsibility betweenthe participating bodies.
(ix) As to entirely new towns, the weight of evidence was that mostlocal authorities, in view of their heavy existing and future responsibilities,would hesitate to assume new duties of this type or size.(x) For entirely new towns, the first choice of agency by representativesof local authorities was in most cases the government sponsored corporation;in the few cases where the authority felt itself capable of undertaking thework, in its capacity as a local authority, the second choice was again the government sponsored corporation.(xi) We found it significant that the representatives of the London CountyCouncil, of the Corporation of the City of London, and of the CountyCouncils Association (of England and Wales) were categoric in their pre-ference for a government sponsored corporation where the town was to be entirely new. The representatives of the Association of County councils in Scotland shared this view, except in the case of towns to be brought intoareas where new coalfields are being developed, where they preferred thecounty council and put the public corporation next.(xii) For an entirely new town the idea of a local authority sponsoredcorporation had been given little or no attention. Some witnesses seemedto regard a combination of dispersing and receiving authorities, or of tworeceiving authorities acting jointly, as a possible agency; and in one specificcase a scheme was stated to be well advanced for a combination of localauthorities acting through a joint committee. But the powers for sucha joint committee would have to be delegated to it by the participating localauthorities, and it had been found that, under existing law, they are insufficient for the development of a new town. Assuming that legislationprovided the increased powers necessary, the suggested joint committeewould be analagous to the local authority sponsored corporation.(xiii) In the event of government sponsored corporations being established as agencies, most witnesses urged that local authorities should be directly or indirectly represented thereon.(xiv) Witnesses were unanimous that there should be a separate agency for each new town, and many of them regarded some central co-ordinatingbody as desirable if not essential.(2) Commercial enterprise(i) We have interviewed representatives of associations formed by thebuilding and contracting industries, and of associations of bodies interestedin the finance of buildings and development. We have also interviewedrepresentatives of certain individual companies.(ii) The representatives of these asociations were unanimously of opinionthat the creation of entirely new towns was not a suitable field for theirtype of private enterprise. The main reason given was the extent towhich public interest was involved, and the need for it to be properlysafeguarded by public control.(iii) They hoped, however, that private enterprise would be brought in as early and to as great an extent as possible in the work of construction and development. As to finance, the representatives of insurance com-panies and building societies said that the provision of equity capital wasnot within their province, but they would be prepared to assist large-scale development of this nature by mortgages in their normal way of business.(iv) On the other hand, some individual large firms of builders claimed that their own and similar firms would be competent to build and financeeven entirely new towns. They realised that profits would have to belimited and that they would be subject to the normal controls of planning
9 -    220and byelaws. They were, moreover, willing, in the public interest, toaccept some limitation of their freedom of action, such as working bymeans of an authorised association.(3) Authorised associations and housing associations(i) There are no authorised associations in existence but there are manyhousing associations, representatives of whose federation were interviewed.They claimed that housing associations would be competent to build evenentirely new towns and told us that an association for this purpose was already in process of formation for one of the new towns proposed in theGreater London Plan, 1944. They contemplated that the necessary financecould be obtained partly from government sources and partly from financial institutions by way of mortgage and that the equity finance might beobtained privately or be raised by public issue.(ii) We were impressed by the initiative and public spirit reflected bythese suggestions and by the value of housing associations as a means forstimulating and maintaining local interest in this kind of project. Butthough such associations have already carried out admirable housingschemes in many areas, they have undertaken nothing comparable inmagnitude with the creation of a new town.9. Conclusions and recommendations as to agency in arriving at the conclusions which follow, we have had constantly inmind that the establishing of a new town, whether it be entirely new or a major extension of an existing small town, involves not only the creationof the physical environment, but also the development of a balanced com-munity enjoying a full social, industrial and commercial life.Recommendations as to the acquisition of sites have already been made inparagraph 3.   Our further recommendations are:  (1) Each scheme for a new town should be treated separately and oneagency should be responsible for each.(2) This single agency should be generally responsible for planning anddevelopment.(3) We regard it as essential that the agency chosen should have noother responsibilities.(4) In our opinion a government sponsored public corporation, financed by the Exchequer is, in general, the most suitable agency.(5) We assume that such a corporation will be invested with sufficientpowers to enable it to cany out its task free from the administrative controland consequent interference which are necessarily associated with full and direct government responsibility. The appropriate minister (the Ministerof Town and Country Planning or the Secretary of State for Scotland)should have the power to give such directions as he may from time to timeconsider necessary in the public interest in any matter of major policy.Subject to that, the corporation must have freedom of action comparable with that of a commercial undertaking. At the same time it must establishrelations of mutual confidence with the citizens of the new town. our views on some points of constitution and powers of such a corporation aregiven in paragraph 10.(6) Provision should be made for local authorities to initiate the creationof new towns if they desire to do so, particularly in the following cases:  (i) where the authority of a large urban area, in carrying out redevelop-ment, has to displace some part of its population and industry, and&apos; there-location can best be provided for in a new town or a major extensionof a small town;
(ii) where a county council, or a district council of sufficient strength,wishes to promote a major extension of a small town within its ownarea; or(iii) where two or more authorities (urban or rural or both) are interested either in a new town or a major extension of a small town.(7) In all such cases we recommend that the appropriate minister, havingapproved the proposal, shall authorise the formation of a local authoritysponsored corporation on which the local authority or authorities shallbe represented as well as the Government. Housing could be undertakendirectly by any of the authorities (if housing authorities) on sites leasedfrom the corporation, or by the corporation itself under an agreement withthe authority.(8) A new town must not be developed solely as a rehousing area inconnection with slum clearance. We have already stressed the importanceof producing the best possible social and economic balance in all such development. Local employment and a representative mixture of socialgroups should be aimed at. If, therefore, local authorities sponsor corpora-tions for the purpose, they must recognise and be able to implement this principle.(9) We have carefully considered the employment of private enterpriseas a possible agency. While it is desirable to provide every opportunityfor private development, we have come to the conclusion that in an under-taking of so far reaching and special a character as the creation of a newtown, ordinary commercial enterprise would be inappropriate. Apart fromithe risks involved, both in matters of finance and in execution, such apolicy would of necessity result in the creation of a private monopoly. Andeven to the promoters themselves, when it came to the point, we believethat the controls which the public interest would demand would render sucha project unattractive.(10) We have also considered the claims of housing associations, asadvanced by ithe representatives of their federation. But we are&apos; unableto agree that housing associations, as constituted in the Housing Acts (seeparagraph 6) were intended by Parliament for this purpose. For theestablishing of entirely new towns or for major extensions of existingsmall towns, their enthusiasm, to which we gladly pay tribute, exceeds their capacity.(11) There remains the authorised association, the definition of which isalso given in paragraph 6. Where local interest is sufficiently enterprising,and local equity finance forthcoming in sufficiently large amounts, we re-commend an authorised association as an appropriate agency. We canimagine circumstances in which such an association might be formed bylocal commercial interests, by groups of public-spirited individuals or bya combination of both. It is desirable to provide for associations of this type, if only to direct the energy and experience of building and estate-developing firms into town building.10. Public corporationsAs our primary choice of agency is the public corporation, either govern-ment or local authority sponsored, we think it convenient at this point to make suggestions as to their constitution and powers:(1) Government sponsored corporation(i) Constitution(a) Appointments should be by the Crown, and members should beremovable on certificate of the appropriate minister.
(b) The governing body should consist of six to eight members.(c) Members should include persons who, among them, have experienceof land development, of economic and social conditions and labour rela-tions, of business and of local government, and appreciation of culturalrequirements.(d) Some members should he chosen after consultation with the localauthorities concerned, it being necessary to secure local contacts and good-will, but it is essential that no member of the governing body should regard himself or aot as a delegate of any other authority or organisa-tion.(e) The object should be to gather together a group of people withvarying qualifications who will work together as a team. The field of choice should not be restricted to &apos; safe &apos; men with established publicreputations; we recommend that the field should be widened to includeyounger people with drive and imagination and a desire to render publicservice.(/) The term of office should be five years with staggered termination.Members should be eligible for re-appointment but it should not be auto-matic.(g) The chairman should be of recognised public standing, and ableto devote adequate time to the work. He and the other governors shouldbe part-time.(h) It is desirable that some of the governors should five in the newtown.(j) The chairman and other governors should be adequately paid.(k) The board should appoint the chief executive who should not be amember of the board.(ii) Powers*(a) The corporation must be vested with all powers required as free-holders, feuars, or first leaseholders for determining policy, controllingdevelopment, granting leases, and erecting buildings to whatever extent it may decide.(6) While it is not intended that the corporation should exercise thefunctions of a local authority, it should be authorised, where necessary inthe early stages, to supply drainage and such other services and amenities as cannot be provided within the area of the new town by thelocal authority as then constituted. It should, however, be the objectof the corporation in due course to transfer such services to the localauthority for an agreed consideration.(c) The corporation should be authorised to supply public utilityservices where statutory undertakers are unable to do so.(d) The corporation should be authorised to make agreements with local authorities.(e) Public money should be available to the corporation on the same terms as to local authorities.(iii) RelationshipsIt should be obligatory on the corporation:  (a) to develop and maintain co-operative relations with the localauthority and residents of the area, and to create the machinerynecessary for that purpose;* Appendix 3 Legislation required, and Appendix 4 Corporation for Stevenage,should be read in conjunction with this section.
(&amp;) to render an annual report to the appropriate minister and tothe Central Advisory Commission and otherwise to consult and co-operate with the Commission as indicated in paragraph ii;(c) to comply with any direction in matters of major policy receivedfrom the appropriate minister.(2) Local authority sponsored corporation(i) The essential differences between this type of corporation and thegovernment sponsored corporation defined above lie in the provision offinance and in the nomination of its governing body. Otherwise its con-stitution, powers and obligations are the same.(ii) Where there is a local authority sponsored corporation, financeshould be provided by public loan raised by the local authorities con-cerned. Legislation is needed to make this possible. Loans to thecorporation direct by the Public Works Loan Board should not be excluded and such loans would justify the appointment by the Govern-ment of its own nominees on the governing body. In such circumstances,however, as recommended in paragraph 6 (4), a proportion of the governors should be nominated by the local authorities concerned.(iii) Before such a corporation is formed, there must foe agreement among the local authorities concerned, both dispersing and receiving, andthe county council for the area. Such an agreement must cover theprovision of finance, the right of nomination to the governing body, thedisposal of accommodation in the new town, and generally the relation-ship between the individual local authorities and the corporation.C.   Central Advisory Commissionii. (1) If the foregoing recommendations are accepted, there will bea number of agencies operating throughout the country. We consider thatsome measure of central co-ordination and advice will be required both by theappropriate ministers and by the agencies themselves.(2) We therefore recommend that a Central Advisory Commission shouldbe established by the Minister of Town and Country Planning and theSecretary of State for Scotland.(3) We shall make detailed recommendations in a later report as to the composition, method of appointment and general procedure of the central advisory Commission. Meanwhile, the types of function we have in mindare:  (i) to provide a central pool of information and experience;(ii) to advise the appropriate minister on any points referred by him,or on its own initiative to offer advice;(iii) to deal with matters referred to it by the several agencies and generally to advise the agencies;(iv) to receive an annual report from each agency dealing with its workto date, to make such suggestions and representations to the agency con-cerned as the Commission may think fit, and to report thereon to theappropriate minister;(v) to advise, where necessary, on the allocation of labour and materialsamong the several agencies;
D.   Ownership of Sites12. (i) We recommend that the freehold or feu of the site, where the agency is a government or local authority sponsored public corporation, shouldbe held by that corporation. Should it eventually happen that all state-ownedland is held by some form of commission, whether national or regional, eachcorporation should be enabled to retain its identity by holding its land directtherefrom under long term lease.(2) If the agency is an authorised association, we recommend that the free-hold or feu should be vested in some body of national trustees. The agency should be granted a lease of the site for nine hundred and ninety-nine years at a ground rent commensurate with the interest payable by the nationaltrustees on the purchase price. As during the early stages of development a nominal or peppercorn ground rent is desirable, the interest due duringthe first five to ten years should be recouped by a proportionately higherground rent for the later years.E. Finance of Agencies13. We make here the following recommendations on the finance of the agencies:  (1) The greater part of the cost of building a new town will be repre-sented by the cost of housing, factories and other buildings which can be financed on a normal basis. But the initial expenditure on the purchase ofthe land and the provision of roads, sewers, open spaces and various services will not produce a full return for some years.(2) Where the agency is a government sponsored corporation owning the freehold, the funds necessary for these purposes should be advanced bythe Public Works Loan Board or the Exchequer, and the payment ofinterest be deferred till the income from the town is sufficient to meet it.(3) As already stated, where the agency is a local authority sponsoredcorporation, the authority or authorities concerned would have to provide sufficient sums to finance the primary development. If there were more thanone authority, they would have to agree on the proportion of responsibilityfor the loan charges to fall on each. The Minister of Town and country planning or the Secretary of State for Scotland should have power to sanction their borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board, and the defer-iment of interest on the loans for a period up to, say, five years, the deferredinterest being spread over a subsequent period. Loans for development should be repayable over a period not exceeding eighty years. During thefirst few years of the development, when the expenses may exceed therevenue receivable, there may be some burden on the rates of the promotinglocal authority or authorities, though this will at any rate be eased by thedeferring of interest on loans for development. After a period there should besufficient revenue to cover these charges. If at a later date there is a surplus revenue, the corporation should make good to the promotingauthority or authorities the amount of their original loss.(4) WheTe an authorised association is the agency, the equity or risk-taking capital being provided by private subscribers, the Public Works(vi)   in order to secure uniformity of practice, to advise on the scale of salaries paid by agencies and on methods of appointment of personnel.It is not intended that the exercise of the functions of the Central advisory commission should otherwise infringe the executive responsibility and freedomof action of individual agencies.
Loan Board should he empowered to make advances from time to time. Theterms on which loans are granted to an authorised association may properly be varied according to the financial structure and control of the associa-tion. If the association were formed hy an approved body of persons,wholly independent of any commercial interest in building or other businessdevelopments in the town, it should not be necessary to impose any other conditions than a limit of dividend on private capital, a limit of the advances in relation to expenditure and valuation, and the normal conditions of a firstmortgage. If, however, the association were formed by business interestsintending to enter into contract with the association for example, by a firm of builders or a manufacturing firm establishing a factory in the town additional safeguards would be necessary. In that event, the condi-tions for exchequer loans should include, in addition to the conditions already mentioned, the following:  (i) a covenant not to dispose of any interest in the land for periodsin excess of three years except on terms approved by the Public WorksLoan Board;(ii) an option for the Government to acquire the association^ interests at a fair valuation at any time, at, say, two year&apos;s notice.Such mortgage conditions governing terms of land disposal as recom-mended in (i) tend to be hampering. They should, therefore, be drawn and operated as liberally *as practicable, but they are plainly necessary where an authorised association is controlled by commercial enterprises which arenot themselves subject to a limitation of profits.(5) Where development is due to re-location of population or industryfollowing war damage, the agency should be put on the same footing,for the purpose of receiving any government grant under Section 5 of theTown and Country Planning Act, 1944, as would have been the local plan-ning authority if the authority had itself undertaken the development.(6) We do not, in this report, deal with subsidies for housing. Itwill be essential, however, that in the matter of subsidies under theHousing or other Acts, the agency or any housing authority or associationbuilding houses in a new town shall not be at a financial disadvantage ascompared with housing authorities elsewhere.F. Industries14. The success of a new town as a balanced community, both sociallyand economically, depends very much upon the introduction and develop-ment of adequate and suitable industries simultaneously with housing andother forms of building. It is vital therefore that the national policy forthe location of industry shall keep in step with the national policy for thedevelopment of towns. Industrial trading estates, wisely sited therein, need to be established at the outset, and every encouragement must be offered toindustrialists to favour these new centres.G. Legislation15__(1) Further legislation is necessary, because the present powers arenot adequate for the creation of balanced new towns or satisfactory large-scaleextensions of small towns under that unity of control which is indispensable.No new principle, however, is involved; comparable powers exist undervarious Housing and Town and Country Planning Acts. They are unwork-able for the present purpose because they devolve on different ministers,are of piecemeal character, and cannot be used to produce complete towns.
(2) Thus, at present there is no legal process by which the government can acquire a complete town-site, including green belt land, tor transfer to a public corporation which is the type of agency we have primarily recom-mended. The powers under Section 35 of the Town and Country planning act, 1932 (or the corresponding Scottish Act) for acquisition of land andthe finance of new-town schemes undertaken by local authorities or authorisedassociations are inadequate; and the powers of local authorities to undertakedevelopment, wide as they are if the Housing Acts and Town and country planning Acts are taken together, are still insufficient for our purpose.(3) We regard such legislation as a matter of urgency in view of the speedat which housing estates are to-day being selected and developed, in manycases with small regard to the broader social and economic considerations.Many local authorities are continuing to handle the matter solely as a questionof housing their own population, and, if this is allowed to continue, we fear that any policy for the accommodation of overspill population in well plannedtowns will be hopelessly prejudiced by the loss of green belts and the distend-ing of existing towns by unregulated sprawl.(4) The points on which new legislation is urgently required are set out inAppendix 3. We shall report later on certain less urgent matters, including any legislation that may be required in connection with the application of housing subsidies to new towns.H. Stevenage16. (1) Stevenage is suggested in the Greater London Plan, 1944, as oneof the new towns in the outer ring round London. We are informed that thedevelopment of this town is a matter of urgency, and that the agency mustbe chosen before legislation can be obtained.(2) It is possible that by a special arrangement with the HertfordshireCounty Council, at the request of the Minister of Town and Country Plan-ning, the necessary land may be acquired for the County Council underSection 35 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932, the Exchequerproviding the necessary finance. We recommend that there shall be anarrangement between the County (Council and a government sponsoredcorporation established by Royal Charter, which will enable the latter toproceed in advance of legislation.(3) A draft charter for this corporation, drawn up at our request by theTreasury Solicitor, is in Appendix 4 (Note: Charters for corporations estab-lished after legislation has been passed would derive from that legislation and be different in content).J.   Summary of Main Recommendations17. (1) Acquisition of site(i) The decision as to the situation and boundaries of a new town must rest finally with the Government paragraph 3 (1).(ii) The Government should have powers of compulsory purchase of the site on behalf of the town development agency paragraph 3 (2).(iii) The site acquired should include the whole of the proposed built-up area and a surrounding belt of appropriate depth paragraph 3 (3).(2) Choice of agency for development(i) Each scheme for a new town should be treated separately and oneagency should be responsible for each: paragraph 9 (1).
(ii) This single agency should be generally responsible for planning anddevelopment paragraph 9 (2).(iii) The agency chosen should have no other responsibilities para-graph 9 (3).(iv) A government sponsored public corporation, financed by theExchequer, is the most suitable agency paragraph 9 (4).(v) Subject to any direction on matters of major policy, the public cor-poration should have freedom of action comparable with that of an ordinary commercial undertaking paragraph 9 (5).(vi) A similar public corporation sponsored and financed by interestedlocal authorities is appropriate in some cases paragraphs 9 (6), (7) and (8).(vii) Ordinary commercial enterprise is not an appropriate agency  paragraph 9 (9).(viii) A housing association is inappropriate as agency paragraph 9 (10).(ix) An authorised association is an appropriate agency in certain cases paragraph 9 (11).(3) Public corporations(i) Government sponsoredConstitution, powers and relationships paragraph 10 (1).(ii) Local authority sponsored.Interested local authorities should provide finance and nominate some members of the governing body paragraph 10 (2).(4) Central Advisory commission a Central Advisory Commission should be established bv the Ministerof Town and Country Planning and the Secretary of State for Scotland toadvise them and the individual agencies, and with responsibilities indicated paragraph 11.(5) Ownership of site(i) Where the agency is a public corporation, it should hold the freeholdor feu paragraph 12 (1).(ii) Where the agency is an authorised association, the freehold or feushould be held by some body of national trustees, and a lease grantedto the association paragraph 12 (2).(6) Finance(i) Funds for a government sponsored corporation should be advanced by the Public Works Loan Board or the Exchequer and if necessary pay-ment of interest deferred in the early years paragraphs 13 (1) and (2).(ii) The Public Works Loan Board should be empowered to advancemoney to a local authority sponsored corporation paragraph 10 (2) (ii) orto the local authority or authorities sponsoring that corporation para-graph 13 (3).(iii) The terms upon which any advances are made by the Public WorksLoan Board to an authorised association should vary according to the structure-ture and control of the association paragraph 13 (4).(iv) The agency should be put on the same footing as local authorities for receiving subsidies and grants in appropriate cases paragraphs13 (5) and (6).
