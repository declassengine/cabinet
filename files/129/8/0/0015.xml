IS DOGUldKT IS TH&quot; PROPERTY OR HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERMIEHT)SECRET - COPY NO.CP. (U6)  11 &apos;5imi^Cii^i9iui t &apos;     CABINET114LI.VYL OF GRRMR:7 industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for foreign affairs have considered the Paper by the Chancellor of theRuchy of Lancaster - C.P.(h6) 11:.      I recognise the disadvantages in the Plan which has been put before us for approval, but i feelthat it represents a reasonable interpretation of POTSDAM and thatas ouch we should accept it.      There are, however, reservationswhich are justified under the Potsdam formula and which I think we should make.      Re should insist on a periodical review of theposition being made so as to ensure that a balance of payments is in fact capable of being achieved and that no burden will be imposed on the British taxpayer.      We should also ask for an adjustment to be made if the population should .prove to be appreciably higher than 66  millions.      On the other hand, Ido not think we need make any reservation in regard to increasedfood requirements on account of our recent slaughtering programme,I understand that the Control Office on reconsideration do not now think that the effects of this will be so severe as had been contemplated and that in any case the decline in livestocknumbers would only bo of a temporary &quot;nature, which would not justify the permanent retention of capital equipment.2. I therefore suggest that the British Delegation beauthorised to accept the Quadripartite Plan in the following terms i-His Majesty&apos;s Government accept the proposed plan on theassumption that it is drawn up in accordance with the Potsdamprinciple that Germany, with its present Western frontiersremaining unchanged, should bo treated as a single economic - .whole.      In the event of any alteration in the Western Frontiersor of a decision against a centralised economic administration,the Plan would call for revision.There arc two further assumptions implicit in the plan and in His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s acceptance of it;-(a) that.the population of Germany will not exceed66-g- (sixty-six and a half) millionsj    and(b) that exports will be possible to pay for imports to the extent envisaged in&apos;the Plan, thusobviating a change on the occupying powers or    I .other external assistance.If conditions render either (a) or (b) invalid the plan will need modification.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government considers that the situation inGermany should be- reviewed periodically with all the above -assumptionsin mind   and   that    there    should, simultaneously be reviews ofthe extent to which the measures taken to ensure&apos;elimination ofthe German war potential are effective.      Equally His Majesty&apos;sGovernment attach great importance to the principle contained inthe Berlin Protocol that agriculture and other.peaceful industriesshall be encouraged.      His Majesty&apos;s Government will favour the

modification or removal in due course of any limitationsinherent  in this Plan on the expansion of peacefulindustries; subject, always to the requirements of essentialsecurity.h. His Majesty&apos;s Government do not consider that acceptance of the above conditions for review and possiblemodification need affect immediate action in regard to determining the amount of equipment to be removed fromGermany as Reparations.(I lit Id. ) E.B.qreign Office , S. W. 1 ,1.7TE liARCH,  191+6.
