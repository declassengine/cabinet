EGRET1975TH APRIL. 19U6iL^IiiSTREPORT BY- THE COMMITTEE ON FASCISMIn accordance with a decision of the Cabinet on17th December,  I&apos;jk5&apos;:\   the Prime Sinister appointed aCommittee with the fallowing terms of reference&quot;To review the available evidence as to there-emergence of a fascist movement inthis country and to consider the case for amending the existing law with a view tochecking the growth of such a movement.&quot;I. The evidence of the r e-c;.iergence of a fascist raovemont1.. We have studied very full reports from the security service on the re-emergence of fascism.    The;/ indicate thatthere is at present no single fascist movement and no signthat one is about to emerge.    There is no indication that sir Oswald Lio&apos;sley will attempt iii the near future to revive&apos;&apos;the British Union as   . politic;.1 party.     He proposes,however,  to launch a publishing concern which will propagatethe ideas of the British Union.    The concern&apos;s books willhe sold through a book club and through old sup ortors ofidosley, who&apos; will be allowed, to retail them at a profit.It appears to be the hope that club members will formreading circles, which will later broaden into publicdebates, and that by this mea-iis fascist ideas will spreaduntil there is a demand for a political movement toput them into practice.    It is possible that the bookclub will attract in the first few months some - threethousand members representing the core of the old british union, which is still fanatically devoted Do -osley.2. A revised Mosloyite  organisation would have a determinedrival in the British People&apos;s Party.    This party, led byJohn Beckett as Secretary and the Duke of Bedford as President,is the only substantial1  fascist organisation at present in thefield.    It claims,  probably accurately, between four and fivethousand members and aspires to unite British fascism in itself.Its propaganda is pro-German,  anti-communist, recognisablybut not violently anti-Jewish., and largely concerned witheconomic and monetary problems.      Its appeal is to the bettereducated and it will neither attract the strong-arm type offascist nor satisfy the urge for hero-worship which is one ofi&apos;.iOsloy&apos;s chief sources of strength.3. In addition to the aosleyites and the British people&apos;party there are a few groups of fascists,  the largest of which,the League of Ex-Service Men and Women, has perhaps fiftymembers and two hundred supporters.    The groups consist for themost part either of ex-members of British Union who wouldprobably be re-absorbed in any revival of that movement or of individuals so fanatical  &quot;no extreme in their national-socialismthat they are unlikely either to be satisfied by any currentfascist organisation or to rat/tract any following themselves.:-t- 0.ivl. (h5)  63rd   Conclusions, ainuto 3.-1-

-    1984.     We have considered, with, some&apos; tore the question whetherthe existing fascist groups are receiving financial oupoortfrom industrialists.      There is no evidence that they are receiving such support.      The smaller groups rely on smallsubscriptions and the sale of literature and are usually shtrtof money.      The British People&apos;s Party has behind it the wealthof the Duke of Bedford, which is used to bolster its financeswhen necessary.      Before&apos; the war no s ley was prepared to pourhis private fortune into British Union and had to do so to aconsiderable extent after the cessation of the Italian subsidy in 1933.      At present the indications are that he is no longerprepared to underwrite a political movement and that thepublishing concern will be organised so as to pay its way.without, help from outside.5.      Our conclusion is that there is no immediate threat of there-emergence of a significant fascist movement in this country.-We recognise that both the British.People&apos;s party and the groupbound by personal loyalty to Hosley contain the germ of such a movement.      Of the two we regard the Ivlosleyite group aspotentially the more dangerous, but its capacity for development is limited by the public execration of fascism and by theexistence of a rival focus of approximately equal strength.We believe  that,   if this Government can make the next five years a period, of orderly and relatively prosperous reconstruction,no fascist movement will develop  into a serious threat.II.    The case for amending the existing law with a view tochecking &quot;the growth of a fascist movement.6.      We have considered whether an attempt should be made to prohibit the organisation of fascist parties or the propagationof fascist doctrines.     We consider that such an attempt wouldbe difficult to defend in principle and ineffective in practice.An attempt to silence a political minority because its views are abhorrent t* the majority would be a departure from a valuable tradition.      It would open the way to progressivelyincreasing interference with the rights of unpopular minoritiesand might ultimately lead:,to the employment of methodsindistinguishable from thise of fascism.      In practice it y/ould be almost impossible to devise legislation which would prohibitfascism without also prohibiting communism;    and the effectiveenforcement of any prohibition would be a matter of thegreatest difficulty.      In our view an attempt  to suppressfascism would in the long run strengthen it by deepening thecleavage between Left and Right and throwing moderate peopleon the Right into sympathy with the extremists.7.      If fascist doctrines are to be tolerated the question arises whether the existing law is adequate  to deal with anydangerous activities into which their adherents may be led.Under the common law acts done or words spoken or writtenwith a seditious intention are punishable by imprjfcsonmeht&apos;.A seditious intention is an intention - (1)  to bring intohatred or contempt or to excite    disaffection against,The King or the Government and Constitution, or either Houseof parliament or the administration of justice;    or (2) &quot;toexcite The King&apos;s subjects to attempt otherwise than by lawfulmeans the alteration of any matter in Church or State by lawestablished;    or (3)  to incite persons to commit any crime ingeneral disturbance of the peace;    or (h) to raise discontentor disaffection among his Majesty&apos;s subjects;    or (5)  to promotefeelings of ill-will and hostility between different classesof such subjects.     An intention is not seditious if the

-    199object is to show that; The King has been mistaken in hismeasures, or to point out defects in Government with a view totheir1 reformation or matters producing hatred, or ill-will witha view to their removal.8,      The common law Connotation of sedition is far-reachingand flexible.    The Government is armed with wide powers, butthey can be used only insofar as it is possible to convince ajury that their use is really necessary for the ^reservation of public order.      when there Is little apprehension about the safety of the State a,,d the preservation of order, theprospects of obtaining convictions contract:    when thesituation is such that there is considerable apprehensionamong reasonable peoplethese prospects expand.      In ourview, provided the authorities are kept we11 informed of theactivities and intentions of fascist elements,  the law ofsedition gives them the means of dealing with any threat  to constitutional government.9.      Short of threatening the overthrow of the constitution,however, fascist bodies may bo the source of public disorderssuch as occurred in London in 193U--6 .      We have considered whether any extra powers are necessary to deal with this situation.      The law already includes measures especiallydesigned to deal with the problem presented by the british union of Fascists.      The Public Order Act,  1936 prohibits .thewearing of political uniforms and the organisation of privatearmies.      It deprived the fascists of the storm battalionswhich played such an important part in the development of continental fascism and its effect was seen in the decline ofthe British Union and the disorders associated with it from1937 onwards.The Act confers certain powers on the police and localauthorities in relation to processions and these,  added, tothose already possessed by the police under the common law inrelation to both processions and meetings, are in our opinionsufficient, if they are used.firmly,  to enable the authoritiesto prevent disorders arising in connection with demonstrationsorganised by fascists or their opponents.10.    in considering the adequacy of the existing law we have paid particular attention to the problem of anti-semitism.We do&apos;not think that it would be desirable, or-that it wouldbe in the best interests of the -Jews themselves, to introduceany special measures against anti-semi lie propaganda.      Atthe present time, however, when the country is affected, byreactions from the war and from the revelations of Nazi anti-semi tic atrocities, wo feel that the consequences to beapprehended from anti-semitic propaganda are serious enoughto justify proceedings for seditious libel or seditiousconspiracy against individuals or groups of people who attempt by this means to promote feelings of ill-will and hostilitybetween different classes of His Majesty&apos;a subjects;    andthat such proceedings should be taken whenever there  is a good prospect of securing a conviction.11.   Oar attention has been drawn to the fact that the conviction of individual members of an organisation ofsedition does not prevent the organisation from continuing its activities.      it has been suggested that this is a.defect inthe existing law which, might be remedied by providing that where individuals who are the leaders of an organisation orengaged in furthering the objects of an organisation areconvicted of sedition, the court should have power to make anorder frm?rG8rinc that ora-ah ytiou similar to the order modeunder the Defence Regulations r flirp-t the British Union..   -;y...

12.    The arguments in favour of such a measure are (1) thatthe real menace to the state is not the activities of individuals but  the existence of an organisation, the; real,if not ,the avowed, purpose of which is to organise seditiousactivities on the part of its members;    and (2)  that in thislaw-abiding country an organisation declared by due processof law to be illegal loses its attraction to all but thec onsp irat or ially-minded element of the population and thereis less danger of ill informed and credulous persons beingbeguiled into membership in ignorance of its real objects.There are, however, objections of great force to the proposal.IS.    If such a Bill were  introduced it would be necessaryfor the Government spokesman to give a full explanation ofthe common.law relating to sedition and there might as a consequence of this be a demand in certain quarters for thevery wide provisions of the common law to be curtailed by legislation.      As we have said, we regard the law of seditionas a strong safeguard, and indeed the principal&apos; safeguard,against subversive activities.      It is valuable largely because it combines very wide scope with a check on the unnecessaryprosecution of activities which, while dangerous in one period,may be harmless in another.     g/e should accordingly considerit most unfortunate if the scope of the law of sedition werenarrowed or its flexibility reduced by the imposition of statutory limitations;    and if such limitations were the price,as they might be, of legislation on the lines suggested, weshould consider the price too high.      Moreover,  the probabilityis that it would frequently be very difficult to prove that an individual convicted of sedhtious activities was engaged in furthering the objects of an organisation, and it has to beremembered that legislation on the lines suggested would not enable us either to  suppress the main existing fascist groupsor to stop anti-semitic propaganda.14.   Any fascist organisation would, take care to see thatits ostensible objects were above reproach and that its members had official instructions  to pursue those objects only by lawful means.    Mosley is likely  to be most careful what  .he publishes for  some time  to come and the British people&apos;party shows no sign of publishing seditious material.    Thepeople who do publish seditious libels are likely to be thefanatical anti-Semites who  in the main operate individuallyor in loose groups and have no organisation to suppress.    Theimmediate practical effect of legislation would probablybe slight.      It would not enable -the Government t* take any action not already open to it against the people who are theparticular target of public criticism;    and even if theintroduction of such legislation satisfied public opinionfor a time,  the disappointment of the expectations arousedwould in the long run be likely to produce a further andmore embarrassing agitation.15.    After careful consideration we have come to theconclusion that -such advantages as-the proposed legislation^might give are not sufficient to justify the risk of weakeningthe existing common law.

16.       We consider that,  if it is firmly enforced, theexisting law affords adequate protection against the emergence of a strong and dangerous fascist movementin this country.    It must be the particular care of theGovernment to sec that the police and security authoritiesare vigilant to detect breaches of the lav/ and that inall cases, other than the merely trivial, where there-is a reasonable prospect of securing a convictionthe matter is immediately brought to the attention ofthe prosecuting authorities with a view to proceedingsbeing taken.   We understand that the Attorney-Generalis at present considering the evidence available tosupport a charge of seditious conspiracy and/orseditious libel against certain anti-semitic propagandistsIf these proceedings are successful they will&quot;be usefulas an indication both of the scope of the existing lawand of the intention of the Government to enforce itvigorously.17.        Ia the light of these considerations we have prepared the annexed St .tement, which we recouimend should form the basis a&apos; public statements by the H-omcSecretary, e.g.,  in reply to Parliamentary Questions.III.    Summary of Conclusions18.       We conclud e: -1.    That there is no evidence that afascist movement on any considerable scale has emerged or is likely to emerge. . *2.    That there is no necessity to amend thelaw to check the growth of such a movement.3.    That the resources available in theexisting law are sufficient,  ifresolutely applied, and that theauthorities should see that these resources arc applied in such a way as to remove from the Police and theauthorities themselves all possiblesuspicion of Fascist sympathy.I4.    That announcements of Government policy should be based on the Statement set outin the Annex to this Report.J.(On behalf of the Committee)Cabinet Office, 3.A.I.5TH APRIL,  1946.

DRAFT statement the Government have very full information about fascistand potentially fascist movements in this country:    and theyhave&quot;reviewed this information with care.     These movementsare small, disunited, ineffective.     They should be watched,and they will be watched with, the -utmost vigilance;    but theyshould also be seen clearly as what they are - discreditedremnants of a movement which, even when it enjoyed the prestige of foreign success, was a dismal failure in this country and ofwhich-present-5ay manifestations are sometimes more ridiculousthan dan-o-e-poi-n. * While the potential danger of such movementsshould always be Icert in mind there -hould be no -^snic cction.The Government have considered suggestions that thereshould be legislation directed specifically against fascismbut have not felt able to accept them.      Conditions inthis country differ from those in countries where it is thepractice of the dominant, part;- to suppress all onuositionmovements, and there will be general&apos; agreement as&quot;to theimportance of maintaining in our land the traditional liberty to advocate and discuss political doctrines of all kinds*If a particular doctrine impels its adherents to commitbreaches of the law, they should be punished for thoseoffences and for incitement to such offenses and not fortheir opinions.      If believers in fascist ideas engage eithersingly cr in eonsipracy in subversive activities or disturbthe peace, they should be dealt with firmly as law-breakers.The Government have examined in consultation with theLaw Officers the scope of the existing law.     The common law,which includes the law of sedition, is flexible.      It arms theGovernment with wide powers, but full use of those powerscan only be made if a jury is convinced that their use is really necessary for the preservation of public order.Consequently, while in times of calm and stability the government&apos;s&apos;powers to deal with subversive activities   shouldbe used with discretion, in times of stress when public-apprehension about the preservation of order increases,theGovernment should not hesitate to use these powers.    Thus a.balance has in the past been maintained between the danger ofgiving the Government excessive -sowers which may be use! to suppress legitimate opposition and the danger or leaving themwith in.- ieq.uate powers to check activities which, may upsetcons titu tiona.1 government.At the present time when this country as well as othercountries is&quot; suffering from a war brought about by the evilsof Nazi and Fascist dictrines no British jury will have difficulty in proper cases in finding that the use of thepower to punish seditious activities is necessarv for the&quot;preservation of rub lie order:    and the Law Officers aresatisfied that the existing law is fully adequate to enableaction to be taken against all such activities as are r e a lly dan ge r ou s .
