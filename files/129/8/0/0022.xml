SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 122.25th March, 1946.CABINET.Prosperity Campaign.CONFERENCES OF 6th AND 7th MARCH WITH TRADE union executives AND REPRESENTATIVES OF EMPLOYERS&apos;ORGANISATIONS.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.FOLLOWING the decision taken at the Meeting of the Cabinet Committeeon Man-power on the 2nd January, 1946 (M.P. (46) First Meeting), Conferenceswere held in London on the 6th March with Trade Union Executives and on the7th March with representatives of Employers&apos; Organisations.2. Full reports of these two Conferences will be circulated to departments in due course. In the meantime I give in an Annex to this Memorandum someof the main points arising from questions and discussion at both Conferences.In the main these Conferences were successful in so far as they presented thefacts of the economic situation to large bodies of representative and influentialleaders of workers and of employers. A declaration at the conclusion of the TradeUnion Conference and speeches by the President of the B.E.C. and the F.B.I.at the Employers&apos; Conference showed that they were welcomed by both sides of industry.3.   From the experience gained at these two Conferences I recommend that (i) there should be an ordered and continuous campaign to bring home,not only to those engaged in industry but to the public generally, thefacts of the economic and man-power situation. The Committee of officials working under the aegis of the Lord President should be given authority to promote this process of education in every possible way;(ii) in particular, we should prepare a White Paper putting together someof the facts given by the Chancellor and the President of the Boardof Trade, as well as the man-power figures;(iii) following the issue of such a White Paper, statements should be issuedperiodically showing in summary form the progress made;(iv) consideration should be given to the possibility of breaking down nationaltargets for various industries;(v) note should be taken of the sensitiveness to criticism which was apparentat both Conferences. Nothing should be said or done in the campaign to suggest that blame for low production or responsibility for increased production rests solely with either side of Industry. At bothConferences it was made clear that both sides of Industry welcomedbeing taken into the confidence of the Government and being told thefacts; and equally clear that they would not welcome admonition ormere exhortation.G.

ANNEX.I.Points covered by Questions and Discussion at the Conference with trade Union Executives on the 6th March, 1946.Wages and Conditions.1. Existing machinery for wage-fixing was it strong enough to &quot;establish the new standard of life &apos;&apos; ?2. What was the Government^ attitude in regard to the policy of the TradeUnion Movement for a shorter working week1?3. The Government should see that Factory Inspectors use the powersinvested in them in regard to conditions in certain industries.4. The Government should lay down a minimum wage below which no workercould be employed.5. An up-to-date cost-of-living figure should be published immediately &quot; to add strength to the Trade Union case for an increase of wages in manyindustries which to-day are lowly paid.6. Effect of income tax as a deterrent to bigger earnings and to employment of married women would relaxations be made ?7. The agricultural worker would respond to the appeal of more food pro-duction, but he would expect in return wages that would enable himto buy the goods produced by industry.8. The Government was asking for increased&apos; production, whilst employers were asking workers to accept reductions in wages.9. The country was waiting for a lead from the Government on the shorter working week.Profits.1. &quot; Vast profits &quot; were being made by employers.2. Would the Government compel all firms to disclose profits ?3. There was too much production of shoddy goods.Employment.1. Number of men out of work in some industries and in certain localities was this a passing phase ?2. &quot; Most people would be glad to see the back of the last of the german prisoners of war.&quot;3. Need for investigation into the labour and industrial situation in NorthernIreland.4. Thousands of women were being thrown on to the sweated trades.5. Unemployment in or near Glasgow existed whilst the Government wasasking for the production of light engineering and heavy engineering.Food.-  1. Possibility of diverting food to those who are being asked to increase production.2. Dissatisfaction arising from the fact that women in the Forces were receiving more rationed foods than miners.Relations with Managements.1. Bad technique and bad management what attitude would the Govern-ment take to correct this ?2. Recognition by employers of Production Committees and Works Commit-tees would the Government foster this?3. Need for speeding up conciliation procedure.4. The Government must make it clear that they would not tolerate anyemployers refusing normal Trade Union recognition.5. Desirability of technical and scientific staffs being included on joint production Committees.  -6. There was as much need for examining efficiency in managerial andadministrative departments as on the shop floor.7. Employers must stop the &quot;racket of the foreman and staff mutual benefitsociety.&quot;
II.Points arising from Discussion at the Meeting with Employers on 7th March, 1946.1. It was suggested that there were three main points to which the Govern-ment could give particular attention : (1) The promotion of genuine co-operation between the Government and all parties to production.(2) The removal of the present unsettlement which  will  increasinglyprejudice the prospects of production.(3) The cessation of attacks on the efficiency of private enterprise.2. Need for the gradual reduction of taxation both on industry and on theindividual.3.   Need for a progressive removal of controls.4. &quot;No more men are wanted in the mining industry; what is wanted ismore work from those who are there.&quot;5. Need to bring home to every person in the country the gravity of our financial and economic position.6. &quot; Introduction of improved conditions, however desirable these may be.must under present circumstances inevitably aggravate instead of relieve ourserious position. In addition, a brake should be imposed on the rising spiralof wages.&quot;7.   The best hope of achieving the stupendous tasks before the country wato know and understand what we bad to do.8. The Government might issue a White Paper &quot; giving in clear and simpleform the facts and figures which everyone in this country could understand.&quot;The Government should take a lead in this method of education and should carryout a proper campaign providing the necessary information so that every personm the land can have access to these vital facts and figures.9. General appeals to workers to enter an industry or to work harder wouldnot have very much effect. &apos;&apos; What the man and woman looks for is good wages,good conditions and, above all, stability of employment.&quot;foreign Policy.1. Foreign commitments aLmoad were unnecessarily a drain on our man-power resources at home.2. &quot; Doubts as to whether the results of further expenditure effort arisingfrom our external policy &quot; would be diverted to causes which have nothing in common with the purposes of the working class of thiscountry.Service Questions.1. Would the Government bring in conscription without a clear mandate fromthe electors ?2. Men and women in the Services would like to know the number of groups which would be demobilised by the end of the year.Need for Information.1. The Government was not taking workers sufficiently into its confidence asit should during this particular period.2. Need for more propaganda to the public by the Government&apos;&apos; could anymore be done ?3. Number of men out of work in some industries and in certain localities was this a passing phase ?4. Miners were tired of being &quot; talked at &quot; about production.5. Understanding by the people of the present economic situation was beinghampered by two fears. First, that engendered by the anti-Sovietcampaign now going on. Second, that the production drive would be exploited by employers in the interests of their profits.
10. &quot; It would be a great help if Trade Union leaders, particularly local or branch Trade Union leaders, would cease to run down conditions in industryand rather try to give some credit for what has already been done to improvethese conditions.&quot;11. Cause of absenteeism and reluctance among many workers to pull their full weight was caused by : (i) Weariness due to the war.(ii) Sickness, particularly amongst older workers.(iii) Higher wages, which cause some to slack off (because workers have not sufficient to spend those higher wages on).(iv) The operation of P.A.Y.E.12. Suggested that there should be a system by which additional earningswere taxed at a lower rate.13.   Some kind of wages policy was essential.14. Criticisms in public of deficiency of private enterprise was not goodbusiness.15. The Government should clearly define the scope of its proposals fornationalisation during the lifetime of this Parliament.16. The Government Departments should worry more about price thanprofits.17. There was room for greater co-ordination between Government Depart-ments operating in the industrial sphere much time was being wasted by firms who had to deal with two or three different Government Deparments on the same subject.18. The Government should look to the factor of concealed unemployment many workers still engaged in the manufacture of obsolescent munitions of war.19. The Government should counsel the workers that in making their contri-bution to production they are in effect serving the State even though they may beemployed by private enterprise.20. Houses suitable for skilled staff and key personnel must be provided in development Areas if firms were to be able to start new projects.
