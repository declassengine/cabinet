The statisticalreturn summarising progress for England and Wales at the 31st January, and appendix B to this return, giving particulars of progress by each local authority,were published on the 25th February and the 6th March respectively. Similarstatistics for Scotland were given in a return published on the 25th February.2. Progress.The following figures summarise the progress made on housing by localauthorities in FebruaryTenders approved (cumulativetotals)      .........      45,294Houses under construction ... 17,117Houses completed (cumulativetotals)      ......... 352At At31st January. 28th February.57.13723,300445Increasein February.11,8436,18393A detailed statement of the position at the 28th February is shown in annex A. In view of the reception accorded to the first issue of the Housing-Return it seemed to me desirable to publish both Returns again in full. the february return should be published about the 26th March and Appendix B will again be published a few days later.The number and percentage of the.different types of local authority who havehad tenders approved are given below: Total No.of authorities.cbs.. .........      ...        83L.C.C. and M.Bs.BoroughsU.D.CsR.D.Cs.Total303095724751,469No. withtendersapproved.7615152214265722Percentagewith tendersapproved,91-650 048-237-455-849-2The position in London is better than it looks, inasmuch as the greater part ofthe provision for the whole of the area is made by the London County Council andthe fact that no tenders have yet been approved for a number of metropolitan borough Councils does not mean that provision is not being made for the needs ofthose Boroughs.Outside London the authorities who have had tenders approved include themajority of the larger towns and, in fact, including the County of London cover74 per cent, of the population of the country.In addition to the 722 authorities who have had tenders approved, a further479 have been authorised to go to tender, and tenders from these authorities should come forward in the near future.
This leaves outside London a residue of 268 authorities, representing10-1 per cent, of the population of the country. In many of these, delay has been caused by difficulties about technical staff. To overcome these difficulties I havehad prepared type plans, specifications and quantities for use by local authorities.My Regional Officers are taking steps to ensure that, wherever more rapid progress can be secured in this way, these are adopted by local authorities at any rate forthis first instalment of their programmes.Scottish figures are shown in Annex B.3. Use of Private Builders by Local A uthorities.I have considered with representatives of house builders how their activitiescan be more fully utilised for the provision of houses for letting for the LocalAuthorities.   Arrangements have been worked out (1) to enable builders who own land to make it available for Local Authoritiesand to undertake themselves the erection of houses on that land;(2) to enable the small house builder, who is known by the Authority to buildhouses of a good standard but who is unable to tender in the ordinary way because of his inability to cope with detailed plans and quantities,to build houses for the Local Authority at an agreed price : such houses would usually be based on a model house already built by the builder,adapted so far as necessary to satisfy approved standards of design and accommodation.In neither case will a price in excess of the ruling tender prices in the districtbe approved.4. House Building Prices.Data relevant to the average price per super foot for three-bedroom housesincluded in tenders approved in January and February respectively are not yet available. There are indications, however, that these prices will show an increasecompared with the price for three-bedroom houses included in tenders approvedto the 31st December, 1945. The rise is due partly to the recent increase in wages in the building industry and partly to increases that have recently taken placein the price of a number of building materials.During the last few months, mainly owing to increased labour and fuelcosts, increases in prices have been conceded in respect of Slates       ...............      Welsh 6 per cent.Cornish 17^ per cent.Salt Glazed Pipes       ...       ...       ...      England 10 per cent.Clay Roofing Tiles      ...       ...       ...      6-7\ per cent.Increases are under consideration in -respect of salt glazed pipes produced in Scotland and sanitary fireclay ware.The Ministry of Supply have agreed to increase prices in respect of ironand steel, copper, lead and zinc.Assuming the maximum use of these materials in a single house, the approxi-mate increase in the price of the house would be  7.Applications for increases in the cost of a number of other materials arelikely to be made and until the effects of improved organisation and output canbe secured, I must warn my colleagues that there is likely to be an upward ratherthan a downward trend in building prices.5. Rural Housing.Separate statistics for rural housing are given in Annex C.It has not yet been possible to complete the arrangements for the productionof the prefabricated house for rural areas to which I referred in my last report.In particular it has not yet been possible to settle the price for the componentsof this house. The Minister of Works and I are endeavouring to resolve this as soon as possible, but in the meantime the issue of a Circular to Local Authoritieshas had to be deferred.6. Permanent Prefabricated Houses.A Circular announcing the scheme for the production of the B.I.S.F. houseswas sent on the 14th March to authorities for selected large towns for which this type of construction is specially suitable.
The houses will all at present be to one standard plan (semi-detached with three bedrooms).The houses will be available to local authorities at fixed prices ranging from26,9. \\d. to 26s. 10c/. per square foot according to the number of houses on the site plus a delivery charge in some regions. A grant will, however, be made withthe approval of the Treasury under Clause 17 of the Housing (Financial and miscellaneous Provisions) Bill sufficient to reduce the cost of the houses to thelocal authorities to the ruling price in the area for comparable houses built bytraditional methods.Delivery of the steel frames is expected to begin in May or June. Sites for ,000 houses which are fully or partly serviced are already available and meetingsare being held with the local authorities concerned to arrange a definite pro-gramme for the preparation of sites to match the production of the houses.The production programme is dependent on a steady flow of materials. Thereare special difficulties about plasterboard and asbestos cement: discussions aretaking place with the promoters to find the best solution.The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is in negotiation with a group of contractors in Scotland for the building of B.I.S.F.houses under similar arrangements.7. Private House Building (other than rebuilding of war-destroyed houses).Houses underProgress at the 28th February,       Licences      construction       Hoiises1946:-- Issued.        (estimated).     completed.England and Wales    ......      33,912 13,000 1,600Scotland......      ....... 574 613* 122*It has become apparent from data recently available that the number ofhouses given in the January return as estimated to be under construction at the81st January was too low; the figures for february,  have been adjusted.In a number of districts, in order to avoid overloading of the market and tosecure a balanced programme in accord with Government policy, I have found itnecessary to instruct the authorities not to issue further licences without expressapproval.8. Requisitioning.Requisitioned houses and flats held for residential purposes on behalf of localauthorities 85,927.Flats and houses of 12 rooms or less still held by the Services and Govern-ment Departments 9,371.Ditto released between the 1st Ma\r, 1945, and 31st January, 1946 24,147.In a recent case the action of the Town Clerk of Glasgow in requisitioninga house for the accommodation of inadequately housed persons by the exercise ofpowers delegated to him by the Secretary of State wras challenged by the proprietors, and the Outer House of the Court of Session decided that the powers given to the Secretary of State by Defence Regulation 51 could not competentlybe used for this purpose. An appeal, which has been lodged against this decision-is to be taken by the Inner House of the Court of Session at an early date.9. Building Materials and Components.The present rate of production of the more important building materials and components and the estimated future monthly rates of requirements are given in annex D and the labour employed in their production in Annex E. The schemefor giving priority in the distribution of building materials and components to housing and other high priority new building construction has now been discussed with representatives of most of the interested bodies. It is hoped that the scheme will be brought into operation on the 15th April.Supplies of plasterboard over the next eighteen months will not be adequate for all the purposes for which it is the most suitable material. War damagerepair, temporary houses, permanent prefabricated houses and traditionalhouses, all make demands on this material which, in the months ahead, wouldbe far in excess of the possibilities of production in this country. Action hasbeen taken to find whatever suitable alternative materials can quickly be placedon the market and to apply such modifications in specification as will securethe best possible results from the material available.   This particular difficulty* Includes work on licences issued by Ministry of Works before 1st August, 1945.
should be eased when the exceptional demands arising from war damage and temporary houses are reduced towards the end of the year, but in the months immediately ahead the position will undoubtedly be difficult. The supply oflabour for the production of bricks has recently been under special considerationby Ministers.The question of arranging a scheme of training for brick-yard operativeshas now been surveyed by the Ministry of Labour and National Service fromthe technical angle. The conclusion reached is that for all brick-yard operations the necessary training can best be given at productive brick-works and that no.satisfactory scheme of training in a special training establishment would be practicable.With regard to training in the brick-works most of the operatives requirepractice rather than specialised tuition. There are, however, four occupationsof higher skill for which a period of training, varying from three or four weeks to six months, would be of advantage. For these, the Ministry of Labour isprepared to arrange for financial asistance for new entrants eligible under thevocational training scheme, and representatives of the J.I.C. have been invitedto discuss detailed arrangements including also arrangements for training andupgrading the best of their unskilled staff.Some improvement has taken place in the labour position in the iron castingsindustry resulting in a net increase of 2,500 in the labour force as comparedwith that at the beginning of September 1945. The use of possible alternativesis being actively pursued. The Essential Work Order is not being withdrawnfrom building materials and components except a few of the latter which fall within the general engineering industry.10. Building Labour.The Minister of Labour has considered what further steps could be takento use on housing work men now on industrial maintenance. Of the exrbuildingtrade operatives then employed in other industries who registered in June1945, slightly over 4,000 were left on maintenance work by decision of the Man-power Boards, and arrangements have been made for each of these cases to be reviewed. There is no record of those maintenance men who, although engaged on building work, are regarded as employees of the industry or services whoseestablishments they maintain and who, accordingly, did not register as ex-building trade operatives. The Minister of Labour states that there is, however, a greatamount of important work for them as the Factory Inspectorate report generaland serious arrears of maintenance work.As regards demarcation the Minister of Labour arranged a meeting withthe Executive Committee of the National Federation of Building Trade Opera-tives, which the Minister of Works and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary ofState for Scotland and I attended. There was a full discussion of the industry sInterchangeability Agreement and a number of other questions such as Training&apos;Schemes, releases from the Forces, &quot; black market &quot; building work, the outputof bricklayers and the shortage of building tools. Arrangements were made forthe points raised to be looked into and in accordance with the suggestion then made Ministers attended the meeting of the General Council of the federation on the 21st March.The Department of Health for Scotland will continue to press localauthorities to let housing contracts on the largest possible scale, so that the increasing labour force can be absorbed. The Ministry of Labour will continueto approach individual employers in Scotland, as necessary, to take up labour to the full. In these ways it is hoped to reduce undue selection or hesitationby employers but the position in Scotland will continue to be specially watched.11. Rate of Output.I was asked at the meeting on the 13th February to arrange for the inclusion in the next Progress Report of statistical information illustrating the position with regard to the rate of output. The Minister of Works dealt with general questions regarding the rate of output in his memoranda on Building prices and on the Efficiency of the Building Industry annexed to the Progress Report&apos;for December (CP. (46) 16), and has now supplied me with the following information.It is difficult to produce any statistical comparison between the pre-war and present rates of output in the Building Industry, especially since precise records of pre-war output are lacking. As regards current output, the test groups ofpermanent houses, in the erection of which measurements are to be taken by the
Ministry of Works on a scientific basis, are not far enough advanced to yieldresults, but there are two main operations, namely, bricklaying and temporaryhousing, for which some data have been collected in the course of the administra-tion of the special payment by results scheme on work carried out under theEssential Work Order.As regards brickwork, some figures can be given, but it is necessary toemphasise that they do not take into account &quot; extra labours,&quot; such as fixingwindows, building arches, cutting out and making good, &amp;c, neither do they take into account walking time, weather stoppages, preparatory work andclearing up, &amp;c, all of which tends to reduce the overall output per 8-hour day to an extent varying with the type of construction involved and the circumstances in which the work has to be carried out. Subject to this, it is estimated that thepre-war output on 9-inch rough brickwork for housing usually fell within a rangebetween 60 and 90 bricks per hour, according to the circumstances of the work, say a rate of between 450 and 700 bricks per 8-hour day, although higher figures arequoted in connection with speculative housebuilding. Records during the war on 9-inch rough brickwork carried out under the payment by results scheme ona variety of war-time work other than housing, show that the average output was 74 bricks per hour, a rate of 592 per 8-hour day. Present day output on workother than housing has been shown to vary considerably, but there are indications of an upward trend in output on general brickwork from the series of figuresobtained in respect of work eligible for bonus under the special payment by resultsscheme. The payment by results scheme does not officially apply to permanenthousing, so that national statistics for housing work are lacking, but other recordshave been made available from Scotland (see Annex E) and suggest outputs of between 300 and 850 bricks per 8-hour day; this is a wide range, and the higherfigures are&apos;on work carried out under bonus systems.As regards temporary housing work, there are indications of an upward trend in output over the last 12 months which must be partly, at any rate,ascribed to growing familiarity with the work. Information is again available from the operations of the special payment by results scheme, and shows thatthe average time taken to erect a training-Seco. temporary house in the period january to June 1945 was 425 man-hours, and in the period July 1945 to February 1946368 man-hours.12. Housing Associations.I have in mind two associations, one for England, and one for Wales, and Iam considering the constitution and getting the articles of association drafted.13.

They do not include estimates of materials or items not supplied in connection with new building or installed by Building and Civil Engineeringlabour, e.g., items or materials bought by private persons, nor an allowance made for the use of the materials in the manufacture of other materials, e.g., the usage of cement inthe manufacture of asbestos cement or of concrete products.   They do not allow for replenishing distributors&apos; stocks or for exports.(2) Estimated Production Capacity. As regards Ministry of Supply items the figures are estimates of available capacity for the periods in question. In certain cases, current production and June estimated rates are in excess of requirements. These margins are necessary to refill the distribution pipe-line. In every case, December forecast ratesexceed requirements.   For certain items, this excess is required to make up the leeway against requirements; in others, it will provide opportunities for export.As regards Ministry of Works items, production capacity refers to the capacity of the industry, assuming existing and planned plant and equipment fully manned.[31510]

ANNEX F.Bricklaying Output Scotland.1. The Housing Inspectors of the Department of Health for Scotland havevisited the districts of 54 local authorities in Scotland to collect data aboutcurrent bricklaying output. The schemes visited included jobs in both urban and rural areas and the data collected can be regarded as fairly representative of scottish output as a whole. The information was obtained in some instances from local authority officials and clerks of works and in others from the contractors.2. Particulars of the output on each scheme visited are shown in the attachedtable.3. It will be seen that the output varies considerably from scheme to scheme.The lowest ranges from 280 to 320 bricks laid per man-day on the schemes of theCorporation of Glasgow, which is the only local authority employing direct labour.In this case the estimate is based on the Housing Inspector&apos;s own observationsafter discussions with the clerks of works employed by the Corporation. Theoutput on Edinburgh schemes is also low at 350 bricks per man-day. this estimate was supplied by the Corporation^ Housing Officer.4. At the other end of the scale are the following schemes where payment by results arrangements are in operation : Local Authority.AberdeenDundeeDunfermlineGalstonKirkcaldyMontroseMusselburghStewartonOutput per Man-Day.600830700/1,000600700570700/8006005. Elsewhere the output ranges from about 350 to 550 bricks per man-day.The average output in Scotland is approximately 500 bricks per man-day.6. All the Housing Inspectors emphasise that output is improving and that,with better building weather, there should be an appreciable rise in the dailyaverage.Housing Schemes.Brick Laying Output.County.
