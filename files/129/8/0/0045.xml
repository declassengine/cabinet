1AGRICULTURAL wages memorandum hy the Minister of Labour and National ServiceActing on the authority granted to me hy the Cabineton 7th February, last (CM. (1+6) 13th Conclusions, Minute 9)I invited the National Farmers&apos; Union, the National Unionof Agricultural Workers and the Transport and general works&apos;  Union to meet jointly at the Ministry for thepurpose of discussing the recommendation of the independent members of the Agricultural Wages Board in favour of a systemof grading of wage rates which would recognise special skill.Two meetings have been held the results of which I have already communicate to the Minister of Agriculture.      We are agreedthat I should now report the situation as I see it forconsideration by our colleagues.      At the first meeting heldon 22nd February, the Workers Unions while at first totallyrejecting any suggestion of grading, finally agreed to enterinto discussions if the question of the minimum wage could also be discussed.      The meeting was adjourned to enable the   *National Farmers&apos; Union to consider whether they could agreeto such an extension of the scope of the discussions.2. Following a number of separate talks with the two sides, the second meeting was held on 2nd April, on the basisof an exchange of views, embodied in the following statements-Nat ijDjaal-Fam^^&quot;The National Farmers&apos;  Union are prepared to explore the practicability of grading of the wages ofagricultural workers *    The fixing of the minimum wageis, however, the sole responsibility of the agricultural wages Board.      Therefore, any discussion on the minimum wage must be through the machinery of the Wages Board.Workers&apos; Unions,The Unions agree that the fixing of the minimum wage is the sole responsibility of the agricultural wages Board.      In their view, however, discussion ofgrading is impracticable without reference to the amountof the national minimum wage.    They are prepared to explore the practicability of grading on this basisor understanding.&quot;3. After considerable discussion on the morning of 2ndApril, the Workers&apos; Unions accepted the suggestion of theNational Farmers&apos; Union that the two sides should meet together in the afternoon with one of their own number inthe Chair.      In the result, they came to certain conclusions which are embodied in the following agreed joint statement;-(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP, (1+6)  li+5 COPY NO. 6g9th April, 19h6CABINET

&quot;Realising the responsibility of both employers anclemployees in the industry to achieve maximum efficiency,the representatives of the National Farmers&quot; Union,the Rational Union of Agricultural Workers, and theAgricultural Section of the Transport and General Workers&apos;Union have together fully examined the implications of agrading system as suggested by the Independent Membersof the Agricultural Wages Board.They are satisfied that there can be no objection tothe principle involved,  but are agreed that theintroduction of such a system is impracticable andunworkable at the present time.,In spite of this decision, reached after a thorough examination of the problem, they are convinced that developments both in farming practice and agricultural education will, long term,  induce the circumstances whichwill facilitate the recognition of additional skill,merit and knowledge by a higher scale of pay and theypledge themselves jointly to work continually towards thebuilding of a wage structure that will encourage the attainment of those qualities which will raise the status of the industry and those engaged in it.&quot;1+.       The position that has now been reached seems to me tobe as follows.      The recommendation of the independent members has been fully discussed and there is common agreement as to the desirability of a wages structure designed torecognise special skill.      This, however,  is a long term policy and cannot be regarded as a solution to any immediatewages problem.It is,  of course,  open tc  the workers, if they wish to pursue their claim for an increase in the minimum wage to renew their application to the&quot;Wages Board.      It isunderstood, however, that they are reluctant to go to theWages Board again unless they can see some reasonable prospect of a modified attitude on the part of the Board.The National Farmers&apos; Union whilst they have stated theywould welcome a renewed application by the workers,  appearreluctant to assume any responsibility for an increase inthe minimum wage without some assurance on prices.      TheGovernment, however, must continue in its refusal to guaranteean automatic increase in prices to offset any such wage increase.      Meanwhile the labour situation is unsatisfactory and unless some positive action is taken to resolve thisimpasse the position is likely to deteriorate.5.        Care must, however, be taken to avoid any action thatmight weaken the authority of the Wages Board;    as will beseen from the statement in para.  2 above, both sides agreethat the fixing of the minimum wage is the sole responsibilityof the Wages Board.      Equally,  it is important to avoidanything that could be interpreted as Government intervention.We should find some means of making it clear that two sides of the industry must each carry their share of theresponsibility for the level of the minimum wage with assistance from the Independent Members of the Wages board in cases of dispute or difficulty.

6-       In^allv the -circumstances., I would favour- a resumption of the,negotiations between the Farmers&apos; Union and the Workers1 -Uni-nd&apos;    &apos;to deal with the situation created, by their joint statement in para. 3 ah&amp;ye.     For this purpose,; I&apos; suggest I -should be given Iauthority^to call the two sides together and,  in the course of&quot;the ensuing discussions, to tell the Farmers&apos; Union on theauthority of the Minister of Agriculture, if he so agrees,  thathis Department would, be prepared (a)  to give a decision on prices with the utmost possible speed in the event of a decision by the Wages Board to increase  the minimum wage,  and (b) tomake such adjustment in prices, as was reasonable.      This wouldbe on the lines of the assurances recently given by me to theemployers in the brick industry after consultation with theMinister of Works.7.        At present,  the Government is being pressed to influence the Independent Members in their consideration of any renewedapplication.      I should hope however by the means I have outlined above to ensure that if any wage dispute persists, it can beshewn to arise from a genuine difference of view between thetwo sides of the Industry on the merits of the claim as such.The farmers should not be in a position to suggest that in resisting the Unions&apos; claim they are acting with the tacit -approval of the Government.      (In the joint discussions with myDepartment,  the farmers have taken the line that whatever theapplication they are in duty bound to resist it, so that thedecision shall always be given by the Independent Members.)8.        There is.one further matter to which both the Minister of -Agriculture and myself feel it is.important to refer.      In thecourse of the  joint discussions the two sides agreed that theactual wages being paid to farm workers were, in a great many instances,  above the minimum wage,  in some cases by as much as30/-.      The present campaign in favour of an increase in theminimum, wage, however, makes nc mention of this acknowledgedfact.      In the result,  a publicity is being given to the wagesposition of the industry which is both harmful to its status  -and detrimental to its prospects.      In the opinion of theMinister of Agriculture and myself,  this aspect of the matter should be put to the two sides in an endeavour if possibleto secure agreement that a fair picture of the industry shouldbe presented to the public in any future publicity.      Naturally,however, it must be recognised that the Workers Unions will beloathe to agree  to any such proposal whilst they are pressing .for an increase of the minimum wage.    . In my view, anopportunity to take up this matter with the two sides would be presented by the resumed discussions which I have  suggested inparagraph 6 above.The fact that the actual wages are in excess of theminimum wage is also a powerful argument in favour.of pressing -the industry to pursue with vigour the question of an improvedwages structure.G.
