(46) 109.lith March, 1946.CABINET.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE-PARIS, 1945.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.I attach the Report of the Government Delegates to the 27th Session of theInternational Labour Conference held in Paris from the 15th October tothe 5th November, 1945. In accordance with the usual practice this Report willbe presented to Parliament as a Command Paper without delay.2. The Conference was extremely successful. Before the Conference muchi apprehension was felt as to the wisdom of holding it in Paris having regarding especially to the physical conditions, for example relating to food, fuel, &amp;c,prevailing in the French capital. The French Government, however, took special steps to ensure that these physical difficulties were overcome or at least mitigated,and their efforts in this direction undoubtedly contributed greatly to the successof the Conference and to the important results that were achieved.3. The Conference was successful also from the point of view of the british delegation, which was led by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofLabour and National Service. The members of the Delegation made their full contribution to the discussions of the questions under consideration and exercisedconsiderable influence on the form of the various recommendations and resolutionsas they emerged from discussion. In consequence the results of the conference were, in general, completely acceptable to this country. In particular the delegation were able to secure the inclusion in the Resolutions on employment policy and the Protection of Children and Young Workers of provisions whichrecognised that some of the matters dealt with were the concern of other bodies or organisations and which provided for bringing the conclusions of theConference on those matters to the notice of the bodies or organisations inquestion. In the case also of the numerous proposals for amending theConstitution of the I.L.O. the Delegation were successful in carrying out theinstructions of the Cabinet by securing that only those matters which it was essential to deal with at once were pressed to a conclusion at this Session of theConference. These matters relate to membership, finance and the procedure for amending the Constitution and have already been before my colleagues in cp. (46) 60. All other suggestions relating to the amendment of the Constitutionwere referred to a small &quot; Working Party &quot; with a view to final decisions beingtaken on them at the 1946 Conference.4. It is gratifying that at the election to non-permanent Government seatson the Governing Body Australia secured election for the next three years. TheCommonwealth is now &quot;Represented on the Governing Body by the Governmentsof the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and India; by representatives ofthe United Kingdom, India and South Africa in the Employers&apos; Group and by representatives of the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada in the Workers&apos;Group.5. My colleagues will also be aware that, at the meeting of the governing body held immediately after the Conference, the British Government repre-sentative (Mr. G. Myrddin Evans, Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Labour and national Service) was unanimously elected Chairman for the ensuing twelvemonths.   The Chairmanship of the Governing Body is an honour which is highly[31477]
prized. The movement to place the British Government representative in the chair for this first post-war arose quite spontaneously on the Governing body and is a signal mark of the high regard in which this country is held in theOrganisation.6. I spent a week at the Conference in the course of which I addressed aPlenary Session. I was left with two main impressions which I should liketo record for the information of my colleagues.(1) The atmosphere at the Conference showed that the Organisation possessesa virility and a determination to face the problems of the time in a forward-looking spirit which augur well for the future. I am satisfied that the I.L.O.can not only play a great part in the advancement of social justice, but owingto the association on an equal footing of Governments, workers and employers,can contribute much to the maintenance of peace.(2) The prestige in the Organisation of this country is extremely high.My own remarks to the Conference had a most enthusiastic reception. MostMember States look to us for a lead in the work of the I.L.O. The high regardwhich we enjoy is undoubtedly largely due to appreciation of the part we playedin the war. But it is also due to the support we have consistently given to theOrganisation throughout its existence, not least at San Francisco and subse-quently in connection with the proposed relationship of the I.L.O. withthe United Nations. A further most important factor in our prestige is to befound in the strong delegations which we always try to send to the Conferences.There is no doubt that it pays to send the strongest possible teams to inter-national conferences and I should like to express my gratitude to those of mycolleagues who spared the services of their officers, at a time when all Depart-mental work is so extremely heavy, to participate in and so helped to ensurethe success of this first post-war Conference of the I.L.O.G.

Delegations from other Governmentsincluded the following Ministers:-The Hon. J. M. Fraser, Minister for health and Social Services, Australia; Mr. L. Troclet, Minister of Labour and social welfare, Belgium; Mr. J. Soltesz, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare,Czechoslovakia; Mr. A. Parodi, Minister of Labour and Social Security,France; Mr. G.

The Conference was opened by the Chairman of the Governing Body ofthe Inter,..&apos;.- Labour Office, Mr. Carter Goodrich (United States Govern-ment representative).6. Mr. Carter Goodrich introduced Mr. Justin Godart, representative ofthe French Government on the Governing Body of the International LabourOffice, who welcomed the delegates in the name of the Government of theFrench Republic.7. Mr. Justin Godart said that at a time when many institutions hadcollapsed or lost courage, the International Labour Organisation had continuedits mission of peace with an invincible faith. &quot; It is difficult &quot;,- he said, &quot; to foresee everything that will take place; but it is no illusion to believe that,among the institutions which the United Nations will have to set up to safe-guard the world collectively against aggression, the International LabourOrganisation must find the place to which its past, its vitality and its promisefor the future entitle it. . That is why the Government of the French republic and the French Nation consider your assembly this notable manifestationof international co-operation to he an event of the greatest importance and can assure you of our greatest sympathy.&quot;8. Speeches of welcome were also made by Mr. Le Trocquer, President ofthe Municipal Council of the City of Paris, and Mr. Roussy, Rector of theUniversity of Paris.9. Mr. Carter Goodrich, in his formal opening speech, said that representa-tives were present from 39 States Members of the International LabourOrganisation. Referring to the desire unanimously affirmed by the governing body in January, 1945, for the linking of the Organisation with the united nations, he said:  &quot; The Conference will have the opportunity to consider the general principles, though not the final terms, that should govern the relationship between the International Labour Organisation and the united nations. The two essentials are, first, that the work of the InternationalLabour Organisation should be co-ordinated with that of the new organisa-tion and not left in isolation and, second, that this co-ordination should leave to the International Labour Organisation, with its tripartite structure-ture, sufficient freedom to discharge its responsibilities and make its bestcontribution to the common effort. One of the most interesting of theproposals before the present Conference is a Constitutional provisiongiving assurance that admission to the International Labour organisation shall never be closed to any member of the United Nations. It hasalready been made clear that the door of membership is open to theUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics.&quot;ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT AND VICE-PRESIDENTSro. On the motion of Mr. Ness Edwards, M.P., seconded by Mr. Zellerbach(United States Employers&apos; Delegate) and supported by Mr. J. Hallsworth(United Kingdom Workers&apos; Delegate), the Conference unanimously electedas President of the Conference Mr. Alexandre Parodi, Minister of Labour and social Security, France.
*II. The  following   were   unanimously   elected   Vice-Presidents   of   theConference:  Mr. Trujillo Gurria (Mexican Minister of Labour and government delegates).Sir John Forbes Watson (United Kingdom Employers&apos; Delegate).Mr. Gunnar Anderson (Swedish Workers&apos; Delegate).ELECTION   OF   CHAIRMEN  OF   THE   GROUPS12. Miss Frances Perkins (United States Government Delegate) was electedChairman of the Government Group at the Conference, Mr. H. C. Oersted(Danish Employers&apos; Delegate) Chairman of the Employers&apos; Group, andMr. J. Hallsworth (United Kingdom Workers&apos; Delegate) Chairman of theWorkers&apos; Group.CREDENTIALS  OF DELEGATES13. The Conference appointed the following Committee to report on the-credentials of Delegates:Mr. Paal Berg (Norwegian Government Delegate) (Chairman).Mr. R, S. Brooke (South African Employers&apos; Delegate).Mr. Lombardo Toledano (Mexican Workers&apos; Delegate).14. The Committee reported in the latter part of the Conference that, asthe result of new nominations since the opening of the Session and the admis-sion of additional States (see paras. 25 and 26 below), the number of Statesrepresented at the Conference was 47, and the total number of delegateswas 162.15. The following objections to the credentials of delegates were submittedto the Credentials Committee:(i) An objection concerning the nomination of the Iranian Workers&apos;Delegate, lodged by the Central Council of the Federated Trade Unions ofIranian Workers.(ii) An objection concerning the nomination of the Irish Workers&apos; Delegateand Adviser, lodged by the United Kingdom Workers&apos; Delegate and the dublin Trade Union Council.(iii) Objections concerning the credentials of the Argentine Delegates,lodged by the workers of Argentina and by the Workers&apos; Group at theConference.16. The objection to the credentials of the Iranian Workers&apos; Delegate(Mr. C. Sadri, Director of the Central Union of Workers and Peasants of Iran) was based on the grounds that the Iranian Government had not obtained the agreement of the principal national workers&apos; organisation to his nomina-tion, that two of his advisers were employers, that two others were Govern-ment Officials or employees, and that the travelling expenses of two of the advisers had been paid by their employers. The Credentials Committeewas &quot;not absolutely certain that, morally speaking, the Workers&apos; Delegateand Advisers of Iran are really qualified effectively to represent the workers of that country.&quot; Without further information, however, the Committee didnot feel itself in a position to recommend that the Conference should refuseto admit them. At the same time, it recommended that the Iranian Govern-ment should be requested to do everything in its power to conform in future to the provisions of -the Constitution of the Organisation.17. The objection to the credentials of the Irish Workers&apos; Delegate andAdviser was based on the ground that they were nominees of &quot; a break-awayminority organisation calling itself the Congress of Irish Trade Unions &quot; and
that nominations submitted by the Irish Trade Union Congress, representing amajority of the organised workers of Ireland, had been ignored by theMinister for Industry and Commerce. The Credentials Committee was not of the opinion that the Government of Ireland had in fact departed fromthe provisions of the Constitution of the Organisation, and recommended thatthe protest should be rejected. Nevertheless, the Committee expressed thehope that &quot;in all circumstances, in accordance with the provisions of theConstitution of the International Labour Organisation, the Irish Governmentshould endeavour to secure accord between these two organisations which appear to be of approximately equal strength in representing the interests ofthe Irish Workers.&quot;18: Objection to the credentials of the Argentine Workers&apos; Delegate andAdviser was lodged by the Argentine General Confederation of Labour, byletter on the ground that they were not entitled to represent the labour movement of Argentina, Where &apos;&apos; for many years there has been no freedom of association and the right to express freely the ideas and aims of democracyhas been abolished.&quot;19. On 26th October the Workers&apos; Group at the Conference entered an objection to the Government Employers&apos; and Workers&apos; Delegates of Argentina,&quot; in which country liberty does not exist.&quot; (The Credentials Committee, onthe same date reported the nomination of two Argentine Government Dele-gates with one Government Adviser, and one Workers&apos; Delegate with oneAdviser; it added that the Employers&apos; Delegate who had previously been nominated was not taking pant in the Coference.)20. At a plenary sitting of the Conference on the same morning, Mr.Jouhaux (French Workers&apos; Delegate) and Mr. Hallsworth (United KingdomWorkers&apos; Delegate) protested against &quot; the presence of a Fascist Govern-ment &quot; in the Conference, and the matter was referred to the CredentialsCommittee.21. The Committee reported that, &quot; under present conditions, workers&apos;organisations in the Argentine Republic do not enjoy freedom of association,freedom of action, or freedom of speech,&quot; and that the Argentine Workers&apos;Delegate and Adviser had not been appointed in accordance with the Constitu-tion of the International Labour Organisation. The Committee accordingly recommended that the Conference should refuse to accept them as Delegateand Adviser respectively.22. In a later report, the Credentials Committee reported as follows onthe objection to the credentials of the Argentine Government representatives:&quot; The Argentine Republic is one of the signatories of the United nations charter, adopted at San Francisco on 26th June, 1945. As the united nations Organisation was thus made open to the Argentine Republic, andas the States which constitute that Organisation maintain with it all therelations which derive from the circumstances mentioned above, the Creden-tials Committee considers that it would serve no purpose for it to examinethe credentials of the Argentine Republic at the Twenty-seventh Sessionof the International Labour Conference except as regards their duly verifiedformal correctness.&quot;23. In all the above cases (paras.. 16-22) the Conference adopted the Com-mittee&apos;s reports. In the case of the report on the credentials of the ArgentineWorkers&apos; Delegate and Adviser, a record vote was taken and the Committee&apos;recommendation was adopted by 119 votes to none, the four United kingdom delegates voting in favour of the Committee&apos;s recommendation.24. The Conference also adopted a report of the Credentials Committeewhich endorsed a protest made by the Workers&apos; Group against the presenceoE incomplete delegations from Greece, Brazil, Ecuador, Haiti and Liberia.49362 A 4
ADMISSION OF ICELAND. 25.. The conference adopted a resolution to admit Iceland to the Inicxiia-^tional Labour Organisation with the same rights and obligations as the other^Members of the Organisation, the resolution to take effect as soon as theGovernment of Iceland had communicated its formal acceptance of theprovisions of the Constitution of the Organisation and the terms of theresolution.  At a later stage it was announced that the Government of Icelandhad given its acceptance.RE-ADMISSION OF ITALY AND GUATEMALA26. Two similar resolutions&apos; were adopted for the re-admission of Italy andGuatemala to the Organisation, and in due course the Conference was informedthat both countries had accepted the terms of re-admission.27. The Conference took note of a statement made by the duly-authorisedrepresentative of the Italian Government that Italy recognised that the obliga-transactions resulting from Conventions ratified prior to her withdrawal from theInternational Labour Organisation continued to be binding. Speaking, insupport of the re-admission of Italy, Mr. Ness Edwards, M.P., said:&quot; Italy is now on the way to rebuilding democracy in her country.She has been saved from Fascism, and in her return to the InternationalLabour Organisation we hope that she will get inspiration in order toassist her in the task of rebuilding her democracy.&quot;REQUEST FOR ADMISSION BY THE LEBANESE REPUBLIC28. The Conference was notified of an enquiry from the Lebanese Republic,about admission to the Organisation. It was intimated that the Governmentof the Republic could apply for membership when the instrument for theamendment of the Constitution of the Organisation (see below) had been ratified.SELECTION COMMITTEE29. At an early stage, as required by its Standing Orders, the Conferenceappointed a &quot; Committee of Selection &quot; whose chief task was &quot; to deter-mine the order of work of the Conference.&quot; This Committee, nominated by the three Groups in the Conference, consisted of 16 members of theGovernment Group and 8 members of each of the other Groups. HisMajesty&apos;s Government was represented on this Committee by Mr. Myrddin-Evans (substitute: Mr. H. M. Phillips), while the United Kingdom Employersand Workers were represented by Sir John Forbes Watson and Mr. JosephHallsworth, respectively. The Committee elected its officers as follows:Chairman, Mr. Li Ping-heng (Chinese Government Delegate); Vice-Chairmen,Sir John Forbes Watson and Mr. Hallsworth.30. On the recommendation of the Selection Committee, six main Com-mittees were set up, as follows:I. Committee on Standing Orders, composed or 8 Government representa-tives and 4 representatives each of the Employers&apos; Group and theWorkers&apos; Group.It was decided to refer to this Committee that part of the report prepared by the International Labour Office on constitutional questionswhich dealt with the revision of the form&apos; and arrangement of theStanding Orders of the Conference (Item IV of the Agenda).II. Committee on the maintenance of high levels of employment duringthe period of industrial rehabilitation and reconversion (Item II ofthe Agenda).
39This Committee was composed of 30 representatives of Governments,- 15 of Employers and 15 of Workers.III. Committee on the protection of children and young workers (ItemIII of the Agenda).This Committee was composed of 56 members 24 representingGovernments, 16 representing Employers and 16 representing workers.IV. Committee on matters arising out of the work of the constitutional committee.To this Committee, which was composed of 64 members-32Government representatives and 16 representatives each of theEmployers&apos; and Workers&apos; Groups was referred that part of the report prepared by the International Labour Office which dealt with the relationship of the International Labour Organisation to other inter-national bodies (Item IV of the Agenda).The Conference also referred to this Committee a report on constitu-tional questions submitted by the Governing Body of the InternationalLabour Office.V. Committee on minimum standards of social policy in dependent terri-tories (supplementary provisions).To this Committee, composed of 15 representatives of Governments,10 of Employers and 10 of Workers, was referred the Report onItem V of the Agenda. It was also decided that the Draft Recom-mendation contained in that Report should be taken as a basis ofdiscussion.VI. Committee on the application of Conventions, composed of 40 members 20 Government representatives, 10 representatives of Employers and10 representatives of Workers (Item VI of the Agenda). , ...CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS (ITEM IV OF THE AGENDA)31. As indicated above (para. 30), constitutional questions were referred,to two Committees.32. One of these Committees was concerned solely with the consolidationand re-arrangement of the existing Standing Orders of the Conference, whichhave been developed, amended and expanded over a long period of years,and have not previously been overhauled. His Majesty&apos;s Government was represented on this Committee by Mr. Myrddin-Evans (substitute: Mr. H. M.Phillips), and the United Kingdom Employers by Sir John Forbes Watson.The Committee submitted proposals for a revision of the Standing Ordersrelating for the most part to form rather than to substance, and these were adopted by the Conference without discussion. The revised Standing Orderstook effect immediately.33. Only three substantial changes were made. The first provided that representatives of a State or Province of a federal State might be appointedto accompany a Government delegation from a Member State; another pro-vided that representatives of official international organisations invited to berepresented at the Conference might enter the body of the hall; the thirddefined in detail the procedure to be followed by the Conference in dealingwith the proposed amendments to the Constitution of the Organisation.34. The Committee emphasised the fact that this revision of the standing orders did not prejudice in any way, directly or indirectly, the larger questionsof policy and proposals for constitutional amendment which were pending.35. The major problems of the constitution of the Organisation were dealtwith by Committee IV.   His Majesty&apos;s Government were represented on
this Committee by Mr. Myrddin-Evans (substitutes: Mr. H. M. Phillips,Mr. A. McDonald Gordon and Mr. F. Pickford), the United KingdomEmployers by Sir John Forbes Watson, and the United Kingdom Workers $by Mr. Joseph Hallsworth. The Committee elected as Chairman SirSamuel Runganadhan (Indian Government Delegate) and, as Vice-Chairmen,Sir John Forbes Watson and Mr. Robert J. Watt (United States Workers&apos;Delegate).36. The Committee had before it a number of documents. First, it had before it, an interim report prepared by the International Labour Office,which began by recording the preliminary proceedings of the Committee on constitutional Questions set up by the Governing Body in pursuance of aresolution adopted by the Conference at its 26th (Philadelphia) Session, andwent on [a) to outline the new framework of international organisationestablished by the Charter of the United Nations and other recent decisions;[b) to recapitulate the decisions already made by the International LabourOrganisation with regard to its place in this new framework; (c) to discussthe problems presented by the transformation of the Organisation from oneassociated with the League of Nations into one related to the United Nations;and (d) to suggest decisions which it might be appropriate for the conference to take at its present Session.37. Secondly, the Committee was presented with a report of the governing body which contained the following suggestions: &quot;The Governing Body recommends that the Conference should decide to appoint a small Working Party representing Governments, employersand workers . . for the purpose of examining the various suggestions made in the discussions of the Constitutional Committee, and of recom-mending changes in the Constitution which such examination shows to benecessary and advisable.&quot;The Governing Body recommends to the Conference that such of theproposals for amending the Constitution contained in Report IV (1) asdo not require to be finally decided at the present Conference should be remitted to the Working Party for examination and report.&quot;Any proposals for amending the Constitution arising out of the antici-.pated negotiations with the United Nations Organisation should be referredto the same Working Party for examination and report.. &quot;The report (s) of the Working Party, together with its definite pro-posals for amending the Constitution, shall be referred to governments for, observations. On the basis of those observations, a report shall bedrawn up containing draft amendments to the Constitution for submission to and final decision of the 1946 Conference.&quot;38. Appended to this report were a list of the points which had emerged from the discussions of the Constitutional Committee of the Governing Body,and tables presented by Sir John Forbes Watson (member of the Committee)showing the position of ratifications of Conventions in comparison with votescast for Conventions by Government delegates.39. Thirdly, the Committee had before it the concluding chapter of the directors Report to this Session of the Conference, which discussed theproblem of the re-equipping and remodelling of the International LabourOrganisation,, including questions of representation and voting power inSessions of the Conference, and the obligations of Governments in relationto Conventions adopted by the Conference.
40. After a long discussion in which the United Kingdom Representativesstrongly supported the proposals of the Governing Body, it was unanimouslym decided to recommend the Conference&apos;to take iinal action at once in respect* of a limited number of questions which were of immediate urgency andwhich had of necessity to be dealt with at the present session of the Conference,ft was decided to remit all other pending constitutional questions to theproposed Working Party with a view to the Report of the -Working Partybeing considered and final decisions taken at the Conference of 1946. Thereport of the Committee to the Conference gave the following reasons forits recommendation:(a) The need for immediate action in regard to certain of the problems arising from the replacement of the League of Nations by the united nations;(b) The desirability of not taking final action in regard to others of thoseproblems until some progress had been made in the anticipated negotia-tions between the International Labour Organisation and the united nations;(c) The need to afford Governments a fuller opportunity for considera-tion of some of the questions which had been raised; and(d) The desirability of reviewing the constitutional problems of theOrganisation as a whole.41. On this basis, the Committee submitted to the Conference a numberof resolutions and an &quot; Instrument &quot; for the amendment of certain articles in the Constitution of the Organisation.Relationship with the United Nations42. The first resolution welcomed the entry into force of the Charter ofthe United Nations; pledged the full co-operation of the International LabourOrganisation with the United Nations; confirmed the desire of the Interna-tional Labour Organisation to enter into relationship with the United nations on terms to be determined by agreement; and authorised the governing body to enter, subject to the approval of the Conference, into such agree-ments with the appropriate authorities of the &quot;United Nations as might benecessary or desirable for this purpose.43. In submitting this resolution, the Committee recalled and endorsed the desiderata formulated by the representatives of the International LabourOrganisation in a statement conveyed to the United Nations Conference at san Francisco, with special reference to ithe need for safeguarding the free-dom of action of the Organisation, maintaining its tripartite structure, andpreserving unimpaired its direct relations with Governments. The Committeenoted that there was nothing in the United Nations Charter, or in recentobservations made public by the Executive Committee of the PreparatoryCommission of the United Nations, which was inconsistent with these principles.Relationship with Other International Bodies44. The second resolution welcomed the progress made to assure close collaboration between -the International. Labour Organisation and other publicinternational organisations, and requested the International Labour Office tocontinue to take all appropriate steps to develop such collaboration.Amendment of the Constitution45. The Committee recommended the Conference to adopt immediately anumber of amendments ito the Constitution of the Organisation which for
compelling practical reasons should be made without delay. For this pur-pose, the Committee submitted a draft &quot; Instrument &quot; for the revision ofthe provisions of the existing Constitution relating to membership, finance andthe procedure of amendment.46. As regards membership, the amendments provided that, whereas hithertomembership of the League of Nations has involved membership of the Inter-national Labour Organisation, in future any original member of the united nations, and any State admitted to membership of the United Nations underthe Charter, might become a Member of the International Labour Organisa-tion by accepting the obligations contained in its Constitution. Such anarrangement, the Committee stated, would be an expression of the aspirationof the Organisation towards universality. In the case of States which arenot members of the United Nations the amendments provide that futureadmission will require a two-thirds majority vote in the Conference including two-thirds of the Government Delegates to the Conference.47. With regard to finance, the International Labour Organisation hashitherto been financed through the budget of the League of Nations. the amendments provided that the Organisation should now be empowered tomake such financial and budgetary arrangements with the United Nations asmay appear appropriate, and also provided for alternative arrangements to bedrawn up which could come into operation pending the conclusion of arrange-ments with the United Nations, or in the event of no such arrangements being in force at any time. It was further laid down that these alternative arrangements must be determined by the Conference by a two-thirds majority and must include provisions that the budget and the arrangements for theallocation of expenses among the Members of the Organisation are to be approved by a Committee of Government representatives.48. Further, it was provided that a Member State which was in arrears inthe payment of its financial contributions should have no vote in the Con-ference, in the Governing Body in any Committees, or in the election ofmembers of the Governing Body, if the amount of its arrears equalled orexceeded the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding twoyears.49. As regards procedure for constitutional amendments, the existing constitution provides that no amendment can come into force until it hasbeen ratified by three-quarters of the States Members of the Organisation,including all the States represented on the Council of the League of Nations.The proposed &quot; Instrument &quot; provides that before an amendment takeseffect it must be ratified &apos;&apos; or accepted &apos;&apos; by two-thirds of the States Members,including five of the eight States &quot; of chief industrial importance.&quot;50. Having regard to the fact that the entry into force of these proposed amendments will be governed by the existing constitutional procedure, andto the possibility that the Council of the League of Nations may cease to existbefore the &quot; Instrument &quot; can be brought into force, the Committee recom-mended a further provision to the effect that in this event it should comeinto iforce on ratification or acceptance by three-quarters of the Membersof the Organisation.51. In view of the importance of prompt ratification of the &quot; Instrument &quot;the Committee recommended the Conference to approve, a resolution drawingthe attention of Governments to the urgency of the matter and expressing the hope that all States Members will have ratified the &quot; Instrument &quot; beforethe opening of the next general Session of the Conference.
OTHER QUESTIONS ARISING OUT OF THE PROPOSEDWINDING-UP OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS52. Another resolution proposed by the Committee authorised the governing body to make arrangements with the League of Nations or with the united nations in regard to the future ownership, control and use of properties andother assets held by the League on behalf of the Organisation, and propertiesand assets in which the Organisation has a partial interest, and also to make arrangements concerning the functions and activities of the League relatingto the International Labour Organisation.53. It was also recommended that the emergency arrangements adoptedin 1944, for supplementing the &quot; chancery &quot; functions entrusted to theSecretary-General of the League of Nations by the Constitution of theOrganisation and by existing conventions (receipt and registration of ratifica-tions, etc.) by direct communication of documents to the Director of theInternatonal Labour Office, should continue in operation.54. Under the existing Constitution, the meetings of the Conference mustbe held at the seat of the League of Nations unless the Conference itselfdecides otherwise. The Committee proposed that the Conference shouldrenew the authority given tc the Government Body last year to decide theplace of meeting&quot; of the next Session.The &quot; Working &quot; Party55. As already recorded (paragraphs 27 and 29 above), the committee decided, on the suggestion of the Governing Body, to recommend that allthe constitutional questions on which no decision was taken at the present session of the Conference should be remitted to a small &quot; Working Party &quot;and brought before the Conference next year with a view to final decision.56. The Committee proposed that this &quot; Working Party &quot; (which was tobe known as &quot; the Conference Delegation on Constitutional questions &quot;)should have a comprehensive mandate to review all the questions raised duringthe constitutional discussions of the last eighteen months and to consider any new points which might be raised by its members, by Governments, orby members of the Governing Body.57. It was further recommended that the &quot; Working Party &quot; should meet in London in January, 1946, and should remain in session until it had drawnup a report containing proposals for the amendment of the Constitution.This report, which should cover any proposals arising out of the anticipatednegotiations with the United Nations, should be referred to governments for their observations, and on the basis of those observations a further report should be drawn up containing draft amendments for submission to and finaldecision of the 1946 Conference.58. The Committee recommended that the Working Party should consist of six Governments (United States of America, China, Cuba, France, UnitedKingdom, Union of South Africa), three Employers&apos; Representatives (Mr. F.Yllanes Ramos, Mexico, Mr. P. Waline, France, Sir John Forbes Watson,United Kingdom), and three Workers&apos; Representatives (Mr. J. Hallsworth,United Kingdom, Mr. L. Jouhaux, France, Mr. R. Watt, United States ofAmerica).Proposals Adopted59. The report and recommendations of the Committee summarised in thepreceding paragraphs were adopted by the Conference without opposition.60. After formal revision by the Drafting Committee, the text of the&quot; Instrument for the amendment of the Constitution of the International&apos;Labour Organisation &quot; was adopted on a final record vote by 116 to o. Thefour U.K. delegates voted for its adoption.
COMMITTEE ON EMPLOYMENT (ITEM II&apos; OF THE AGENDA), ...61. On. this Committee H.M. Government were represented by Mr. NessEdwatxds, M.P. (substitutes: Mr. E. A. Hitchmart, Mr. J. M. Fleming, Mr. A.McDonald Gordon and Mr. R. R. Bowman). The United Kingdom employers were represented by Sir John Forbes Watson (substitutes: Mr. W. Scholes,Mr. Herbert Kay, C.B.E., and Mr. R. Graham Kerr). The United KingdomWorkers were represented by Mr. E. W. Bussey. The Committee elected thefollowing officers: Chairman, Mr. Ness Edwards, M.P.; Vice-Chairmen,Mr. G. F. Evelein (Netherlands Employers&apos; Member) and Mr. J. Racamond(French Workers&apos; Member).62. The Committee submitted to the Conference a resolution, which ithad adopted by 39 votes to.i, on economic policy for the maintenance of full employment during the period of industrial rehabilitation and reconversion.The dissentient vote, it was stated, was that of a Government member whodisagreed with one paragraph only of the resolution.63. In its report the Committee said the problem of achieving and main-taining full employment was perhaps the most important question of a social and economic character that could be considered by the Conference. the objective was expressed in the Charter of the United Nations as well as inthe Declaration of Philadelphia; but it was not sufficient to insert an objective in a.text; it must be implemented by both international and national action.It was generally agreed (continued the report) that full employment depended on. the maintenance of a high level of expenditure, the main components ofwhich were private and public investment;., private consumption, current expenditure by Governments, and expenditure (by citizens of other States)on exports. The object of economic policy must, therefore, be to stabilisetotal expenditure as far as possible at a level ensuring full employment.In the transition period, however, there was a danger in many countries,not.that total expenditure would be too low, but that it would be too highin relation to the. supply of goods, with a consequent danger of inflation.Consequently, policy must be directed, on the one hand, to increasing thesupply .of goods and services and to promoting their export from countrieswhich had thern to countries which needed them (especially the devastatedcountries) and, on the other hand, to maintaining controls as long as theshortages prevailed. At the same time, it was possible that, when the in-flationary danger had passed (and this might be at a very early date incertain countries), the problem would be that of maintaining an adequatelevel of demand for goods and services and consequently of employment.The resolution contained proposals to deal with these problems.64. The Resolution proposed by the Committee consisted of a Preambleand 13 Sections. The Preamble recited the circumstances leading the Con-ference to adopt the Resolution and concluded with the decision of the Con-ference,; to bring the suggestions in the Resolution to the notice of governments and of the international bodies primarily concerned. Reference was made todeclarations on the subject contained in the Charter of the United Nations,the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund, the Articles ofAgreement of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,and the Declaration of Philadelphia, and to the Employment recommendations adopted at the 1944 Session of the Conference. The preamble recited that&quot; the maintenance of full employment in the period of industrial rehabilitation-tion and reconversion also requires the adoption of appropriate policies relatingto such matters as investment, consumer spending, international capital move-rhents and trade, and the&apos;planning of industrial reconversion and. development in relation to changes in the structure of industry:&quot;.;&quot;&apos;
65. The body of the Resolution was made up as follows:(a) Section 1 stated that the Conference welcomed the adoption of the charter of the United Nations, and noted with keen satisfaction that it provided for international economic and social co-operation for the pro-motion among other things of higher standards of living and full employ-rrient, and conditions of economic and social progress and development,and that it pledged all members to take joint and separate action inco-operation with the United Nations Organisation for the achievement of these purposes. It was noted that several Members of the InternationalLabour Organisation had already officially affirmed their determination to achieve full, or high, levels of employment in the post-war period andhad set out the methods they proposed to use, and it was urged thatall Members should take the same course.(2) Section 2 stated that it should be the responsibility of governments to take all steps within their power, in collaboration with workers&apos; and employers&apos; organisations and industry generally, to establish such economicand financial (including fiscal) conditions as would facilitate full employ-ment; it also declared that, as the success of a full employment policy inone country would often depend on factors controlled at least in part byother countries, including the availability of raw and semi-manufacturedmaterials and capital equipment and the equilibrium of the balance of pay-ments, Government policy in relation to these matters should have due regard to the impact of particular national measures upon the employment situation in other countries.(3) Section 3 contained suggestions for the maintenance of a high levelof investment and the elimination of shortages of capital goods which create&quot; bottlenecks &quot; and hinder an increase in employment and the productionof consumers&apos; goods.(4) Section 4 recommended measures for counteracting inflationarydevelopments due to shortage of goods and high demand for goods. these measures included the retention, so long as shortages prevailed, of controls over prices, production and distribution, supplemented, as necessary, by financial or taxation measures designed to absorb any excess of monetarydemand.(5) Section 5 dealt with the relaxation of controls and abatement of the taxation level when more normal economic conditions were reached.     &apos;(6) Section 6 indicated action to maintain demand when the inflationaryperiod had passed, including the adoption of a suitable budgetary policy.(7) Section 7 recommended the establishment of appropriate minimum wage standards, adequate for satisfying reasonable human needs, in orderto assist the progressive raising of the standard of living of all workers.(8) Section 8 stated that as the shortages of transport, sources of power,materials and industrial equipment in relation to the available labour whichcharacterise the period of industrial rehabilitation and reconversion moreespecially in the devastated countries which are members of the united nations, tend to cause unemployment, and the shortage of consumptiongoods, more particularly food, clothing and medical supplies, may depriveemployed workers of the minimum standards necessary to enable them to do their work efficiently, arrangements should be made by the Governmentsconcerned to enable the countries in which there are serious shortages ofsuch goods to import the sources of power, materials and industrial equip-ment required to restore transport, to reconstruct their industries and&apos; toreplenish their stocks and consumers&apos; goods necessary to ensure to thepeople a satisfactory standard of living.
i6(9) Section 9 stated the need for raising the standard of living in lessadvanced countries (particularly those with large agricultural populations)and outlined measures whereby the industrialised countries might helpthose countries.(to) Section 10 referred to the need for paying attention, in planningindustrial reconstruction and development, to war-time changes in the structure and location of industry.(11) Section 11 stated that in order to facilitate economic recovery andto further full employment, Members should give consideration to measuresto facilitate the resumption and expansion of world trade.(12) Section 12 referred to the nature of methods whereby countries might be enabled to bring their balances of payments into equilibrium.(13) Section 13 advocated the creation of machinery including tripartiteconsultative bodies where appropriate, for implementing the measures sug-gested in the Resolution. -66. With a single formal amendment the report and resolution were adoptedby the Conference on the motion of Mr. Ness Edwards, M.P. (United King-dom government Delegate), who stated that the suggestions made withrespect to anti-inflation policy in the period immediately ahead, and the policies for maintaining full employment which would be required at a later date when shortages had been removed and economic activity intensified, werein accordance with the practices and policies of the Government of the UnitedKingdom. He underlined the point, brought out in the Resolution, thatprosperity was &quot; one and indivisible &quot; and that all nations must move inunison along the lines of a common policy if full employment was to beachieved.-     PROTECTION OF CHILDREN  AND   YOUNG  WORKERS(ITEM III OF THE AGENDA)- 67. On this Committee H.M. Government were represented by Mr. NessEdwards, M.P. (substitutes: Mr. H. M. Phillips, Miss Z. Puxley, O.B.E.,Miss F. I. Taylor, O.B.E., and Mt, R. R. Bowman, C.GB.E.). The UnitedKingdom Employers were represented by Sir John Forbes Watson (sub-stitutes: Mr. G. Marchand and Mr. W. Scholes), and the United KingdomWorkers by Miss Florence Hancock, O.B.E. (substitute: Mr. A. Roberts).The Committee elected the following officers: Chairman, Mr. L. E. Troclet(Belgian Government Delegate, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare); Vice-Chairmen: Mr. J. D. Zellerbach (United States Employers&apos; Delegate) and miss Florence Hancock, O.B.E. (United Kingdom Workers&apos; Adviser).68. The Committee submitted to the Conference two fists of questions onwhich Government might be consulted with a view to further discussions andthe possible adoption of Conventions and/or Recommendations at a laterSession of the Conference. One list related to the medical examinationof young workers for fitness for employment, and the other (to the restriction of night work of children and young persons in non-industrial occupations.Medical Examination69. The Committee reported a large consensus of opinion among its members in favour of the preparation of international regulations for themedical examination of young workers for fitness for employment, particularlyin view of the effects of the war on the health of children and young persons.The importance of medical examination in relation to vocational guidancehad also been emphasised. The questions of the extension of any proposedregulations to agricultural workers and family undertakings also received
attention. The Committee decided that for the present the consultation of governments as to the scope of the regulations should be limited to industrial and non-industrial occupations within the meaning of existing Conventionsrelating to the minimum age for employment.70. The list of questions sought the views of Governments on the desir-ability of one or more draft Conventions or Recommendations providingfor &quot; free and thorough &quot; medical examination for young persons taking up employment, on whether the age-limit for persons covered should be16, 18 or 21, on periodical re-examinations, on supervision and special measures for the protection of workers and young persons found to havephysical handicaps, and on the machinery for administration and enforcement of the regulations.Restriction of Night Work71. The Committee reported that the attitude towards this subject was ingeneral the same as towards Medical examination. It submitted a list of questions covering the form of international regulations, their scope as regardspersons covered, protective provisions relating to night hours and rest periods,exemptions, administration and enforcement. The list of questions also included the desirability of a Recommendation relating to night work in shops,offices, street trading and public entertainment.Resolutions72. The Committee also submitted a number of Resolutions. The first ofthese requested the Governing Body to examine ithe possibility of placingon the Agenda of an early Session of the Conference the question of theextension of medical examination of young persons under 18 to agriculture.73. In a second Resolution the Committee proposed that the governing body should be asked to consider similar adtion with regard to the questionof the revision of the Night Work (Young Persons) Convention, 1919, as thisConvention had in the Committee&apos;s view become out of date in respect ofcertain of the standards fixed.74. The third and main Resolution submitted by the Committee embodieda comprehensive policy for the future for the benefit of childhood and youth.It declared that &quot; Governments, whilst encouraging the fullest discharge of individual and family obligations, should accept responsibility for assuringthe health, welfare and education of all children and young persons and theprotection of all youthful workers of either sex, regardless of race, creed,colour or family circumstances, both by national action and by appropriate measures of international co-operation.&quot; The Resolution recognised that questions relating to the health, education, employment, protection and generalwelfare of Children and young persons were inter-related, and could not be solved in isolation. It further recognised that certain of the matters withwhich it dealt would be primarily the responsibility of other inter-governmentalagencies, either existing or projected, and expressed the hope that suchagencies would carefully consider the views stated in the Resolution.75. The Resolution went on to affirm the deep interest of the Conferencein the furtherance among the nations of the world of programmes whichwould make possible the abolition of child labour by providing for everychild proper maintenance and such conditions of life as would foster thetalents and aptitude of the child and his full development as a citizen andworker, It stated that all necessary measures to this end should be taken on questions relating ;to health and social protection; equality of educationalopportunities&apos; (including provision for vocational guidance, training, economic assistance and the development of apprenticeship); the regulation of the age of admission to-&quot; employment and development of-juvenile placement; social
insurance for young workers; regulation of hours of work, night work, restperiods, holidays, safety, hygiene, carrying of heavy loads, wages, boardand lodging, and the right of association; the application and supervision  J of protective policies; and collaboration on an international basis.   detailed provisions were suggested on each of these items.76. In a fourth Resolution, the Committee dealt particularly with the youth of liberated countries, with special reference to the need for an improve-ment of nutrition, the provision of medical aid, the distribution of medical-ments, the provision of general medical care and health services, the recon-struction of educational and social institutions for the service of childhood andyouth, and the problems of displaced children and orphans.77. The fifth Resolution asked the Governing Body to place on the agenda of an early (if possible, the next) Session of the Conference the questionof regulating the underground work of young persons in mines.78. Finally, the Committee proposed that the Governing Body should be requested to set up an advisory committee to study the problems of young workers.79. After discussions during which Mr. Myrddin-Evans (United KingdomGovernment Delegate) welcomed and endorsed the proposals of the Com-mittee, the list of questions and the Resolutions were unanimously adoptedby the Conference, the United Kingdom Government Delegates voting infavour of them.80. Later, on a record vote, the Conference decided by 118 votes to noneto include on the Agenda of the next General Session of the Conference thequestion of the protection of children and young workers; (a) medical exam-ination of fitness for employment (young workers): [b) restriction of nightwork of children and young persons (non-industrial occupations). The fourUnited Kingdom Delegates voted in favour of the Resolution.MINIMUM STANDARDS OF SOCIAL POLICY IN dependent territories (SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS) ITEM V OFTHE  AGENDA.81. On this Committee H.M. Government were represented by Mr. NessEdwards, M.P. (substitutes: Mr. T. I. K. Lloyd, CM.G., Major GranviUeSt. John Orde Brown, C.M.G., O.B.E., Mr. C. A. Grossmith, O.B.E., Mr.U. Kyaw Min and Mr. I. G. Jones). The United Kingdom Employers were represented by Sir John Forbes Watson (substitutes: Mr. A. R. I. Mellorand Mr. R. Gavin) and the United Kingdom Workers by Mr. G. W. Thomson(substitute: Mr. E. Esua). The Committee elected the following officers:Chairman, Mr. J. M. Fraser (Australian Government Delegate); Vice-Chair-man, Mr. P. Bernard (French Employers&apos; Member) and Mr. Thomson(United Kingdom Workers&apos; Member).82. In the course of a general discussion, several members of the Com-mittee stressed the importance of the more effeotive representation of dependentpeoples at the Conference. The British Government member emphasizedrecent constitutional progress in british territories as indications of the effectiveassociation of the people of dependent territories in the framing and execu-tion of measures of social progress, usually through their own elected repre-senitatives.83. The Committee instructed its Chairman to invite the Selection&apos; Com-mittee to refer to the appropriate Committee the possibility of providing forthe-admission to the-Conference of representatives of the administrations,organised employers and organised workers of dependent territories, appointed
to accompany a delegation by the Government of a member of the Organisa-tion and the possibility of taking other appropriate steps to promote theeffeotive association of dependent territories in the work of the Organisation.(This question was referred to the Committee on Constitution Questions,which decided that it should be remitted to the &quot; Working Party &quot;.) .84. The Committee submitted to the Conference the draft text of a Reeom-mendation &quot; concerning minimum standards of social policy in dependent territories (supplementary provisions)&quot;, which it had adopted by 50 votes to nil, with 17 abstentions.   The Committee also submitted three Resolutions-Recommendation85. The draft Recommendation contains provisions supplementary to those contained in the Recommendation of the same subject adopted at the 26thSession of the International Labour Conference held at Philadelphia in 1944.As in that Recommendation, it provides that each Member State which is responsible for any dependent territory should take all steps within its com-competence to secure the effective application in each territory of minimum stan-dards set forth in an Annex to the Recommendation. These standardsrelate to arrangements for wage-fixing and the encouragement of thrift; thelabour aspects of land policies (including control of the alienation of agricul-tural land and the supervision of tenancy arrangements); social security;placing of workers (where employment or migration is on a sufficient scale);regulation of hours and holidays; labour inspection; conciliation in industrial disputes; protection of health, safety and welfare in industrial undertakings;and methods of making widely known the nature and significance of themeasures adopted in. conformity with the Recommendation.86. The Recommendation was adopted by the Conference on a final.recordvote by 100 votes to o. In supporting the Recommendation, Mr. NessEdwards, M.P., said he was confident that the ^British Government would accept the Recommendation and bring it to the notice of the Governmentsof all dependent territories. &apos;He did not doubt that the response of those governments would be readily forthcoming. The United Kingdom Workers&apos;delegate also voted in favour of the Recommendation; the United Kingdom.Employers&apos; delegate did not vote.Resolutions87. The Resolutions, which had been adopted by the Committee without:opposition, related respectively to the study of the systems of (the possession,ownership and use of the land in dependent territories; the relations betweenthe International Labour Organisation and the authorities of dependent terri-tories; and the advisability of placing on the Agenda of the next Sessionof the Conference for first discussion the question of including in a Conventionsuch provisions of the Recommendation adopted in 1944 and those containedin the proposed &quot; Supplementary Provisions &quot; Recommendation as were suit-able for a Convention.The three Resolutions were adopted by the Conference without opposition.APPLICATION OF CONVENTIONS (ITEM VI OF THE AGENDA)88. Constitutional questions were also touched upon by the Committee onItem VI of the Agenda -&quot; Reports on the application of Conventions (Article22 of the Constitution)&quot;. H.M. Government were represented on this Com-mittee by Mr. G. Myrddin-Evans (substitutes: Mr. F. Pickford and Mr.B. J. Ezard), the United Kingdom Employers by Sir John Forbes Watsonand the United Kingdom Workers by Mr. A. F. Pap worth.   The Committee
elected the following officers: Chairman Mr. J. Stanczyk (Polish government delegates); Vice-Chairmen Mr. L. Birla (Indian Employers&apos; Delegate) andMr. P. J. S. Serrarens (Netherlands Workers&apos; Adviser).89. The International Labour Office presented a summary of annual reports received from Governments for the five years 1939-1944. It pointed out that,owing to war conditions, the number of reports summarised was very much smaller than would have been the case under normal conditions. In spiteof difficulties, however, the States Members had for the most part endeavoured to fulfil their obligation to supply information on the measures taken to implement ratified Conventions.90. The Committee of Experts, in a report appended to the Summary,recalled that its work was in abeyance, owing to the military situation, from may, 1940, until July, 1945. It emphasised the dislocating effect of war conditions upon the ability of countries to carry out their obligations underlabour Conventions, and indicated that it would be in a better position to resume its task of supervision next year. The Committee of Experts also referred to collective agreements in relation to the application of conventions and to legal questions arising out of the position of Federal States in respectof the ratification and application of Conventions.91. The Committee of ithe Conference noted gratifying evidence of the desire of Governments, in spite of the adverse conditions created by the war, tomaintain as far as possible unimpaired the machinery for the supervision ofthe application of Conventions.92. Reporting on its exchange of views concerning labour inspection, theCommittee pointed out that inspection played a fundamental part in the enforcement of national legislation, and expressed the hope that the governing body would find it possible to place the question of labour inspection on theAgenda of the next ordinary session of the Conference with a view to theadoption of a Convention on the subject. The Committee mentioned, withoutcomment, that certain of its members had suggested the possibility of creatingan international inspectorate under the auspices of the Organisation to super-vise *he application of ratified Conventions, especially in industrially backwardcountries.93. Finally, the Committee presented the text of a resolution which it had adopted for consideration by the Committee on Constitutional Questions,containing among other suggestions the proposal to place new obligations onStates Members in relation to the submission of Conventions and Recom-mendations to their national legislative authorities, and to the presentation of reports to the International Labour Office on such submission, includingstatements of the reasons for non-ratification of Conventions or non-acceptanceof Recommendations. (The Committee on Constitutional Questions, whosereport is summarized above (Para. 35-58), included this resolution amongthe outstanding issues to be remitted to the &quot; Working Party &quot;).94. The report of the Committee on the Application of Conventions, whichwas unanimous, was adopted by the Conference without opposition.COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS95. H.M. Government was not represented on this Committee.   The UnitedKingdom Employers were represented by Sir John Forbes Watson (substitutes:Mr. J. S. Boyd and Mr. R. Graham Kerr).   The United Kingdom workers were not represented.96. On the proposal of the Committee, the Conference adopted Resolutionson certain matters not within the scope of any of the items on the Agenda,
relating to the study of population trends (submitted by the United KingdomWorkers&apos; Delegate) and the use of the Spanish language in the official transla-tions, documents and publications of the Organisation (submitted by thePeruvian and Uruguayan Government Delegates).ELECTION OF GOVERNING BODY97. In the course of the Session, elections were held for the eight government-ments which have elective seats on the Governing Body of the InternationalLabour Office, and of the Employers&apos; and Workers&apos; representatives on that body.98. Under the constitution of the Organisation, the Governing Body consistof 16 members representing Governments, eight representing Employers,and eight representing workers.99. Of the 16 members representing Governments, eight are appointed bythe States of chief industrial importance (at present, the United States ofAmerica, Belgium, Canada, China, France, the United Kingdom, India andthe Netherlands). The remaining eight are appointed by Governments elected for that purpose by the Government Delegates to the Conference other thanthose from the States named above. Six of the 16 members must representnon-European States.100. The Employers&apos; and Workers&apos; members are elected by the respectiveGroups in the Conference. Two Employers&apos; representatives and two Workers&apos;representatives must belong to non-European States.101. As a result of the elections, the following eight States were chosen to nominate Government representatives on the Governing Body: Australia,Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Mexico, Peru, Poland and Sweden. (Australia, Egypt,and Sweden are new members; Norway, Greece and Yugoslavia were notre-elected).102. The following were elected by the Employers&apos; Group: Mr. Erulkar(India), Sir John Forbes Watson (United Kingdom), Mr. Gemmill (SouthAfrica), Mr. Li Ming (China), Mr. Oersted (Denmark), Mr. Waiine (France),Mr. Yllanes Ramos (Mexico) and Mr. Zellerbach (United States).103.

The discussion on the Directors Report occupied several plenarysittings of the Conference. Sixty-four Delegates and Advisers from 35countries took part.105. The Report followed the general lines of previous reports. In aspecial chapter on &quot; The Future Outlook &quot; it discussed constitutionalproblems connected with the re-modelling of the Organisation, and referred in particular to certain suggestions which had been put forward for con-sideration. Among these were suggestions for changing the basis of repre-sentation in the Conference and of the voting strength of the three Groups.This question, the Director said, was not one of pure mechanics but ofpolitical advantages or disadvantages. It needed further exploration andany changes would require the considered approval of Governments for theirsuccessful application.
aa:106. A Supplement to the Report dealt with the finances of the Organisa-tion, its income and expenditure during the war years, the results of thefinancial year 1944, the budget for 1945 and the budget estimates for 1946.107. The Rt. Hon. George A. Isaacs, M.P., Minister of Labour and national Service, took part in the discussion on the Report. The InternationalLabour Organisation (he said), by its continued activities during the war, hadstood as a living symbol of the cause of civilised and ordered human progress,and it still stood firm as the most stable instrument of international collabora-tion for human good that had ever been constituted. Its stability andsuccess were due in no small measure to its tripartite character. Mr. Isaacscontinued:  &quot; I bring to you from the British Labour Government a message of grattitude for the work which has been done by the International LabourOrganisation and an expression of their determination to give their full support to that work. The people of the United Kingdom have neverwavered in their faith in this Organisation and, whatever the Governmentin power, there has been no weakening in their support.&quot;Referring to constitutional issues, Mr. Isaacs added:  &quot; We are living in a world of rapid change, and in such a world nothing and least of all the International Labour Organisation can expect toremain unchanged. Changes there must be; but the task demands visionand wisdom as well as enthusiasm. &apos; We must be very sure that anythingwe do will equip us better to meet effectively the challenge of the time, to achieve the purpose for which we exist, and will facilitate the establishmentof a close relationship with the United Nations.&quot;108. Miss Perkins (Government Delegate, United States of America) saidthat the Conference demonstrated the strength of the International LabourOrganisation and the practical nature of its structure and procedure. It wasthe wish of the United States Government that all members of the united nations and all nations eligible lor such membership should share the rightsand duties of membership in the International Labour Organisation, andshould participate fully in its work. Speaking of the future of the OrganisationMiss Perkins said:  &quot; I am instructed to make clear to you beyond the possibility of doubtthat the United States of America intends to continue whole-hearted partici-pation in the work of the Organisation. The Government of the UnitedStates supports the International Labour Organisation as the competentinter-governmental agency within an important field of its activity. my government believes that the International Labour Organisation^ workwill be made most effective through the establishment of a mutually satis-factory relationship with the United Nations Organisation. To this connection-operation the International Labour Organisation will bring the greatstrength of its long and seasoned experience, its established tripartitecharacter, and the mutual confidence based on experience between its members and its parts or groups. It will be a great service in aiding to accomplish the high social objectives set- forth in the Charter of the united nations. From this co-operation the International Labour Organisation willitself gain strength for the accomplishment of the purposes of the Declarationof Philadephia.&quot;109. In his reply to the discussion on his Report, the Acting Director (Mr.E. j. Phelan) said that speeches had shown that the Organisation had notonly succeeded in keeping alive during the world-wide convulsions of thegreatest war in history, but remained uniquely representative of free men andwomen everywhere.   Speakers from all parts of the world and from all three
Groups had made criticisms and suggestions, but the great majority of them had expressed in warm terms their appreciation of the work ol die Organisa-tion in the past and their confidence in its future. Peace, production and social justice were the three pillars on which the future of the. world mustbe built. To them corresponded the appropriate international institutions:First,, the security machinery of the United Nations; second, the economicmachinery of the United Nation-;, comprising the Economic and Social Counciland the group of specialised economic agencies dealing with international trade, finance, food, agriculture, etc., which it would be its principal functionto co-ordinate; and, third, the machinery of the International LabourOrganisation, whose task it was to promote social justice in full co-operationwith other international agencies which would be its natural allies in this task.He was confident that the Conference would, at this Session, take certainimmediate steps to give practical effect to the general principle of association with the United Nations, to secure universality oi membership, and to providefor the examination without delay of those further steps, both structural andprocedural, which had been urged by many speakers as necessary to adjust the Organisation to a changing world.RELATIONS WITH OTHER ORGANISATIONSno. The following official organisations were represented at the conference by invitation of the Governing Body: U.N.R.R.A.; the Provisional Organisa-tion for European Inland Transport; the Inter-Governmental Committee onRefugees; and the Conference of Allied Ministers of Education.in.

Whereas it is desirable that the representatives of Governments, employers and workers assembled at the Twenty-seventh Session of the Conference shouldformulate their views in regard to these matters;The Conference adopts the following resolution and decides to bring the sugges-tions contained therein to the notice of Governments, and of the international bodies having primary responsibility for giving effect to such of these suggestions as are the concern of these bodies;I- (i) The Conference welcomes the adoption of the Charter of the united nations and notes with keen satisfaction that it provides for international economic and social co-operation for the promotion among other things of higher standards of living and full employment, and conditions of economic and socialprogress and development, and that it pledges all Members to take joint and separate action in co-operation with the United Nations Organisation for the achievement of these purposes.(2) The Conference expresses its keen satisfaction that the international monetary Fund and the International Bank for reconstruction and Developmentare required by their respective Articles of Agreement to be guided in all their decisions by the social purposes indicated in the said Articles and quoted in the preamble to the present resolution.(3) The Conference expresses the hope that the United Nations Organisation,through its appropriate organs, will define and put into effect, as quickly aspossible, appropriate measures for furthering international co-ordination of em-ployment policies during the reconversion period, and that for this purpose thefullest use will be made of the International Labour Organisation and the otherintergovernmental organisations concerned.(4) The Conference, noting that several Members of the International LabourOrganisation have already published official statements affirming their determina-tion to achieve full, or high levels of, employment in the- post-war period, and setting out the methods they propose to use, and that legislation designed to achieve similar ends has been introduced in several national legislatures, urgesall Members to take early steps to determine and announce the main features oftheir post-war policy in accordance with the general principles already incor-porated in the Charter of the United Nations.2. (1) It should be the responsibility of Governments to take all steps within their power, in collaboration with workers&apos; and employers&apos; organisations andindustry generally, to establish such economic and financial (including fiscal)conditions as will facilitate the absorption into useful employment, at the highestpracticable levels of remuneration, of all members of the population of workingage, who are able to work and willing to accept such employment.(2) Inasmuch as the successful implementation of a full employment policy inany one country will often depend upon factors controlled at least in part byother countries, including the availability of raw and semi-manufacturedmaterials and capital equipment and the equilibrium of the balance of payments.Government policy in relation to these matters should have due regard to the impact of particular national measures upon the employment situation in othercountries.3. In view of the importance of a high level of investment from the point ofview of employment policy, and in order to&apos; eliminate as rapidly as possible theshortages of capital goods which create bottlenecks and thereby hinder both anincrease in employment and the production of consumers&apos; goods, provision shouldbe made for i[a) measures to facilitate the flow of credit and of capital to new, efficiententerprises; andi(fe) appropriate methods by which public authorities may support and supple-ment investment in types of development (such as housing) which are ofspecial importance from the social point of view; and(c) consultations between Government and industry for the purpose of adapE-ing the volume of private investment with a view to minimising trade fluctua-tions; and\(d) a policy of public investment and related financial measures on the lines recommended in the Public Works (National Planning) Recommendation, 1944.
4- (i) The existence in most countries of a relative shortage of productionand consumption goods, accompanied by a high effective demand for such goodsboth from current income and from liquid assets accumulated during the war,tends to cause an inflationary spiral in prices which would be of such a character as to disturb the economy and might ultimately provoke a crisis. In addition,the rise in prices would have serious social consequences including a reductionin the real income of workers, especially white-collar workers, and of all groups in the community who depend upon a fixed money income, as well as the dangerof widespread industrial conflict. Appropriate measures, including the followingshould therefore be adopted to counteract inflationary developments.(2) The supply of goods should be increased by measures to facilitate theexpansion of production and, where appropriate, of imports.(3) Provision should be made so far as is administratively practicable, for theretention, as long as shortages prevail, of (a) price controls over goods and services; and&apos;(&amp;) direct controls over the production and allocation of raw and semi-manufactured materials, transport, sources of power and capital goods; and(c) limitation of demand for consumption goods by such means as rationing.1(4) To the extent that the above controls are ineffective or only partiallyeffective in preventing inflationary developments, they should be supplemented,as long as is necessary, by financial or taxation measures designed to absorbany excess of monetary demand.(5) An educational campaign should be undertaken to persuade consumers to refrain from using their increased purchasing power in such a way as to forceup prices.5. As the various countries emerge from the phase of shortages and potentialinflation into more normal economic conditions, measures of the following type,construed and timed in the light of the circumstances prevailing in particulaicountries, will become appropriate:the controls mentioned in paragraph 4 above should be relaxed in sucha way as to keep pace with the increasing supply of transport, power,materials, capital goods and consumption goods;&quot;.: (6) the high level of taxation necessary during the war and early post-war period should be relaxed as the inflationary danger recedes, and in applyingthis principle the benefit of tax reduction should apply initially (i) to taxes which bear on lower incomes, and(ii) to taxes likely to restrict necessary investment.6. (1) When the inflationary danger has passed the problem will be to main-tain an adequate level of aggregate of demand for goods and services.(2) In order that the scale of employment offered by private and publicemployers may be adequate, Governments should take positive steps to ensurethat any deficiency in the total demand for goods and services, in relation to that required to achieve full employment in the circumstances ruling at the time,will be offset by an expansion of private and/or public expenditure in accordancewith the principles set out in Chapter II of the report on &quot; The Maintenanceof High Levels of Employment during the Period of Industrial Rehabilitation andReconversion &quot; (Report II) submitted to the Twenty-seventh Session of theConference.(3) One of the principal instruments for achieving this object would be theadoption of a suitable budgetary policy, and in determining such a policy special regard should be had to its effect on the magnitude, and composition of aggregatedemand and thus on the volume and structure of employment and output.(4) In applying the above principles consideration should be given, wheneveraggregate demand threatens to become deficient, to (a) the stimulation of consumption by subsidies;(b) the reduction of taxes on lower incomes;(c) the expansion of public investment.
62(5) Adequate unemployment insurance and/or assistance schemes should beestablished in countries which have not yet adopted such schemes, this beingx      important not only for social reasons but in order to maintain purchasing power.7. In order to assist the progressive raising of the standard of living of all workers, the Conference recommends the establishment of appropriate minimum wage standards, adequate for satisfying reasonable human needs.8.  (1) As the shortages of transport, sources of power, materials and industrial equipment in relation to the available labour, which characterise the period ofindustrial rehabilitation and reconversion, more especially in the devastatedcountries which are members of the United Nations, tend to cause unemploy-ment, and as the shortage of consumption goods, more particularly food, clothing and medical supplies, may deprive employed workers of the minimum standardsnecessary to enable them to do their work efficiently, arrangements should bemade by the Governments concerned to enable the countries in which there are serious shortages of such goods to import -(a) the sources of power, materials and industrial equipment required to restore transport, to reconstruct their industries and to replenish their stocksso that the available labour may be fully employed on productive work inaccordance with reasonable social priorities;  and(b) consumers&apos; goods necessary to ensure to the people a satisfactorystandard of living.(2) These arrangements should include (a) measures to facilitate an increase in the production of means of transport,power, materials and industrial equipment throughout the world;(b) the granting by countries having supplies of such goods of the prioritiesnecessary to make a reasonable proportion of such supplies available to thedevastated countries;(c) appropriate measures for the provision without direct payment, by .N.R.R.A., or by special international, including bilateral, arrangements, ofsuch supplies to the countries which are in the greatest need and have little or no foreign exchange available for their purchase;(d) the provision of short- and medium-term credits either through ordinary commercial channels or, if necessary, by intergovernmental agreements;(e) long term loans at low rates of interest to the importing countries madedirectly by the countries able to make such loans or by or through the Inter-national Bank for Reconstruction and Development.9. (1) An increase in the standard of living in less advanced countries (par-ticularly those with large agricultural populations) is an urgent necessity forthese countries and will be a powerful factor in promoting full employmentthroughout the world.(2) Arrangements should be made to meet the import requirements of theagricultural and raw-material producing countries, more particularly their require-ments of the capital goods necessary to enable them to develop their industrial and agricultural resources to the fullest possible extent.(3) With a view to facilitating the financing of such imports, long-term loansat low rates of interest should be made directly by countries able to make suchloans or by or through the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment.(4) The industrialised countries should provide technical assistance, moreespecially by placing technical experts and training instructors at the disposal ofthe agricultural and raw-material producing countries and by giving facilities forthe training of personnel from those countries.(5) In order to prevent unemployment in the agricultural and raw-materialproducing countries, resulting from the sudden curtailment or termination of contracts concluded by them with other members of the United Nations for thesupply of raw materials for war purposes, joint consideration should be givenby the members concerned to the measures that may be necessary to ensure
that the curtailment or termination of such contracts will cause the least possibledisturbance, including measures to facilitate a transfer of resources to other types of production, and more particularly the replacement of the contracts for war materials by contracts for food and materials required for the relief and recon-struction of the devastated countries.10. In order to prevent the development of local areas of high unemploymentsuch as existed in some countries in the inter-war period, attention should bepaid, in planning industrial reconstruction and development, to the changes inthe structure and location of industry which have taken place during the war.including particularly a great expansion in many countries of industries engagedin the production of war materials, the creation or expansion of various industries in the less industrialised countries and the expansion of industries manufacturingsubstitutes for raw-materials.ii. In order to facilitate economic recovery and to further full employmentMembers should give consideration to measures to facilitate the resumption and expansion of world trade.12. The Conference desires to draw the attention of the appropriate organsof the United Nations Organisation to the importance of promoting arrangements which will enable countries to bring their balances of payments into equilibriumby methods which permit them to maintain full employment without recourse toabnormal or unduly prolonged borrowing from abroad, or to the creation ofunreasonable barriers to international trade.13. In the implementation of the measures suggested in this resolution, andthe creation of (governmental machinery competent to deal with questions of full employment, Governments should give consideration where necessary to (a) the desirability of creating new agencies or strengthening and adaptingexisting agencies to the special demands of a programme for the maintenanceof full employment;(b) the devising and improvement of technical processes involved in theestimation of the current and future volume of employment, income, invest-ment, savings, and of public and private expenditure;(c) the creation and consultation where appropriate of tripartite bodies andin suitable cases of other bodies for the purpose of aiding in the determination and application of policies concerning the maintenance of full employment;(d) the collection and interchange of uniform statistical and economic information relevant to the questions with which this resolution is concerned.XIResolution concerning the protection of children and young workers(adopted on 4 November 1945)Whereas the preamble to the Constitution of the International Labour Organi-sation includes among the objects of the Organisation the protection of children and young persons and the organisation of vocational and technical education;andWhereas Article 41 of the Constitution declares the &quot; abolition of child labourand the imposition of such limitations on the labour of young persons as shallpermit the continuation of their education and assure their proper physicaldevelopment &quot; to be of special and urgent importance; andWhereas the Declaration of Philadelphia recognises the solemn obligation of theInternational Labour Organisation to further among the nations of the worldprogrammes which will achieve &quot; provision for child welfare and maternityprotection &quot; and &quot; the assurance of equality of educational and vocationalopportunity &quot;; andWhereas the solemn commitments involve the acceptance by the public autho-rities of Member States of responsibility for ensuring by all appropriate means that children, the citizens and workers of the future, are brought into theworld and grow up under conditions which afford opportunities for properphysical, mental and moral development and for training for a useful employ-ment or career; and
 3Whereas, although the war and the abnormal living conditions resulting from it have greatly aggravated some of the social problems relating to children.and young workers, many of these problems are of a permanent character and require the adoption of co-ordinated measures, in order to improve the social conditions on which the well-being of children and young persons depends; andWhereas the reconstruction period, during which all democratic nations will seek to restore and improve their instruments of social progress, affords aunique opportunity of reviewing the work already accomplished under the auspices of the International Labour Organisation for the benefit of childhoodand youth and of drawing up for the future a comprehensive policy byformulating the general principles to be followed in order to achieve these endswithin the framework of the fundamental objectives of the International LabourOrganisation;The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation, meeting in its Twenty-seventh Session in Paris, this fourth day of November, 1945,hereby adopts the present resolution concerning the protection of children and young workers.I. General Principles1. The Conference, conscious of its obligation to further the material andspiritual advancement of working people everywhere, reaffirms its conviction that in order to develop to the fullest extent the capacities of the workers andcitizens of the future it is necessary that Governments, whilst encouraging thefullest discharge of individual and family obligations, should accept responsibilityfor assuring the health, welfare and education of all children and young persons and the protection of all youthful workers of either sex, regardless of race, creed,colour or family circumstances, both by national action and by appropriate measures of international co-operation.2. The Conference recognises that questions relating to the health, education,employment, protection and general welfare of children and young persons areinter-related, and cannot be solved in isolation.3. The Conference further recognises that certain of the matters dealt within this resolution will be primarily the responsibility of other intergovem-mental agencies, either existing or projected, and expresses the hope that suchagences will carefully consider the views which are stated in the resolution.II. General Social Protection of Children and Young Persons4. The Conference affirms its deep interest in the furtherance among the nations of the world of programmes which will make possible the complete abolition of child labour by providing for every child proper maintenance and such conditionsof liL-s as will foster the talents and aptitudes of the child and his full develop-ment as a citizen and worker.A.

Educational Opportunities7. The Conference reaffirms the conviction expressed in the Declaration ofPhiladelphia that the assurance of equality of educational opportunities is a necessary condition for equality of vocational opportunity.A. General Education and, Vocational Guidance8. All children and young persons should be provided free of charge withgeneral education which should be of a standard and duration permitting adequatephysical, intellectual and moral development.9. (1) Pre-school education should be accessible to all children without beingcompulsory as soon as possible and as far as practicable.(2) School attendance should be compulsory up to an age not lower than 16years in all countries as soon as circumstances permit and should in all cases becompulsory up to the general minimum age for admission to employment; theschool leaving age should be raised progressively at the same rate as the minimum age for admission to employment, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph19 (2) below.

Admission to employment. Regulation of Minimum Age18. The Conference reaffirms its duty to promote the abolition of child labour,and, convinced that it is in the best interests of children in order to assure anadequate preparation for their future to fix the minimum age for admission to employment as high as possible for all categories of employment:(a) invites all Members to ratify as soon as possible either the four Conven-tions fixing at fourteen years the minimum age of admission to industrial employment, employment at sea, non-industrial employment and employmentin agriculture or preferably, as regards the first three categories of employ -ment, the revised Conventions in which the minimum age for industrial employment, employment at sea, and non-industrial employment is raised to fifteen years; and(b) urges them to take as their objective the gradual raising to sixteen yearsof the minimum age of admission to employment.
- . j19.  (1) When regulating the minimum age of admission, consideration shouldbe given to the following principles, as an appropriate basis of regulation.^ (2] The gradual raising of the minimum age should be accompanied, at eachsuccessive stage, by simultaneous measures for assuring the maintenance ofchildren in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5 above and for organis-ing compulsory education until at least the same age, in accordance with theprovisions of paragraphs 9 (2) and 10 above.(3) So far as possible the minimum age should be fixed simultaneously at thesame level for the various categories of occupations, and especially for industrial and non-industrial employments carried on mainly in urban areas, in order toavoid the risk that application of stricter rules to industrial employments mayinduce younger children to enter employments which are inadequately regulatedand in which they will therefore receive less protection.(4) Attention should be given to regulating the admission of a child to domestic service outside of his own family in the same way as to other non-industrial occupations in accordance with the provisions of the Minimum Age(Non-Industrial Employment) Conventions, 1932 and 1937; special efforts shouldbe made to eliminate forms of employment involving the placing of children in,or their transfer on a basis of quasi-adoption to, the family of an employer wherethey work for maintenance.(5) The employment of children of school age should be carefully regulated toprevent interference with schooling and to ensure full opportunity for study,recreation and rest, with due regard for the following standards;(a) no child of school age should be allowed to work during school hours,whether on his own account, for his parents, or for an employer;(b) exemptions permitting the employment of children of school age outsideschool hours should be eliminated as soon as possible and pending such elimination -tion should be strictly limited in accordance with the following provisions:(i) as regards the nature of the employment, such exceptions should begranted only for light agricultural employment or for non-industrial em-ployments which are clearly unobjectionable;(ii) as regards the number of hours and other conditions, under whichemployment may be authorised by the competent authority, so that it isnot harmful to the health or normal development of the child and is notsuch as to prejudice his attendance at school or capacity to benefit frominstruction there given, in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 ofthe Minimum Age (Non-Industrial Employment) Conventions, 1932 and1937;(iii) as regards age, exemption should be granted only in respect ofchildren who are not more than two years below the minimum age of admission to employment.(6) In order to ensure the effective application of the regulations concerningthe minimum age of admission to employment, documentary proof of age shouldbe required before any child or young person is permitted to enter employment;such proof of age should:(a) be furnished by means of a birth certificate issued free of charge for thepurpose or, where the system of birth registration is inadequate, by meansof other recognised types of documentary evidence or by medical examination;(6) be recorded in documents to be kept by the employer or the youngworker in his possession in order to prove his compliance with the law.(7) The regulations concerning the minimum age for admission to employment which are already applicable to certain categories of family undertakings in accord-ance with the Minimum Age (Agriculture) Convention, 1921, the Minimum Age(Non-Industrial Employment) Conventions, 1932 and 1937, and the minimum age (Industry) (Revised) Convention, 1937, should be extended to all familyundertakings in the spirit of the Minimum Age (Family Undertakings) Recom-mendation, 1937.
(8) For those occupations which, by their nature or the circumstances in whichthey are carried on, are dangerous to the life, health or morals of the children and young persons employed therein an age higher than the general minimum ageshould be fixed in accordance with the provisions of the Minimum Age (Industry)(Revised) Convention, 1937, and the Minimum Age (Non-Industrial Employment)Conventions, 1932 and 1937; m fixing this age it would be advisable:(a) to fix the minimum age for the admission of young persons to employ-ment as trimmers and stokers on vessels at not less than eighteen years inaccordance with the provision of the Minimum Age (Trimmers and Stokers)Convention, 1921;(b) to fix the minimum age for the admission of young persons to employ-ments liable to cause lead poisoning at not less than eighteen years, in accord-ance with the provisions of the White Lead (Painting) Convention, 1921, and the lead Poisoning (Women and Children) Recommendation, 1919;(c) to adjust the minimum age for other hazardous occupations to the serious-ness of the physical or moral risks for young workers in each occupation, so asto afford them adequate protection, with an ultimate goal of at least eighteen years;(d) to prohibit or to lay down conditions safeguarding the entry of youngpersons below the age of eighteen into occupations bringing them into contact with the public such as certain of those in the hotel industry which may beblind-alley occupations and may involve moral risks;(e) to consider carefully the risks involved for children or young persons inthe carrying on of certain types of itinerant trading and similar occupations inthe streets or in places to which the public Ihavo access, in order to fix an appropriate minimum age of admission for these employments as required bythe Minimum Age (Non-Industrial Employment) Conventions, 1932 and 1937.B. Authorisation for Employment or Work20. As the conditions under which a child or young person enters, employmentmay have a lasting effect on his future, entry into employment should be subjectto the following safeguards:\(a) the consent of the parents or guardian of the minor should be requiredfor the entry into employment of a child or young person under the age ofsixteen years;(b) the entry into employment of children and young persons under the ageof eighteen years should be subject to the written authorisation of an appro-priate authority responsible for verifying (i) that satisfactory proof has been furnished that the child or youngperson seeking employment has reached the minimum age for the occu-pation in which he is to be engaged;(ii) that the child or young person has been found fit for the saidemployment by a medical examination made free of charge to the child or young person by a doctor approved by the competent authority, inaccordance with the provisions already laid down for employment at seaby the Medical Examination of Young Persons (Sea) Convention, 1921, orin a comparable manner in the case of employment in other categories ofoccupations;(iii) that the child has received adequate schooling in conformity withthe law and all appropriate measures are being taken to make up anyeducational deficiencies;(c) the competent authority should have the power to lay down in the workpermit special conditions, in conformity with the law, taking into considerationboth the health of the child or adolescent as determined by the medical examination, and the nature of the employment; the permit should be renewedat intervals and, in any case, at every change of employment;i(d) should local conditions make it impossible to raise to eighteen years theage of admission to itinerant trading or similar occupations in the streets or in places to which the public have access, the carrying on of such trades or occu-pations by a child or young person under eighteen years of age, whether foran rirapiovar, for his parents or on his own account, should be subject to theprocuring pi&apos; a special permit and to the wearing of a badge, as provided for bythe Minimum Age (Non-Industrial Employment) iRecommendation, 1932.
66C. Juvenile Placement21. (i) In order that young persons may be placed in the employment wherethey can best utilise their aptitudes and resources, gain a good livelihood andenjoy personal satisfaction in their work, the employment service in each country should provide special arrangements for the placing of juveniles, directly or inco-operation with other appropriate agencies in accordance with a co-ordinatedprogramme under the leadership of the employment service; the chief purposes ofthese arrangements should be (a) to offer to young persons who are seeking employment, or who wishto change from one employment to another, free vocational guidance whichwould take into account their special aptitudes, the general economic situationand existing employment possibilities and which would supplement the guidancewhich these young persons received at school in the course or at the end of theirstudies, as provided for by paragraph n (b) above, close collaboration being maintained with educational authorities for this purpose;(6) to place them in employment or help them to change their employment;(c) to maintain contact with the young workers who have been placfed bythe service in order to give- them the opportunity of discussing their problems with experienced advisers and to help them to solve these problems.(2) This employment service should be entrusted to a special staff and advised by bodies composed or representatives of other public authorities, of employers,of trade unions and of young workers.22. Suitable work opportunities should be provided for young persons either in private employment or in public works programmes. In applying the policyof timing public works provided for in the Public Works -(National Planning)Recommendation, 1937, consideration should be given to the possibility of includ-ing works which will give employment to young workers in accordance with paragraph 6 of that Recommendation.D. Liability to Social Insurance or Social Security Schemes23. (1) In order that young workers may obtain income security as soon aspossible, apart from any indirect claim which certain young workers mightpossess as dependants of either an insured person or a person entitled to social security benefits, young persons should be compulsorily included under social insurance or social security schemes on entering employment.(2) In the case of apprentices who receive no remuneration (a) the benefits of a sickness insurance or social security medical care service should be available at once without payment of contributions by the appren-tice;(o) the compensation for employment injuries should, as from the date atwhich they would have completed their apprenticeship for their trade, be basedon the wages current for workers in that trade, according to paragraph 20 (2)of the Income Security Recommendation, 1944.* (3) Young persons employed for remuneration and apprentices receiving noremuneration who become invalids at a time when they are not yet entitled to social insurance or social security benefits sufficient for their needs should beentitled to maintenance allowances through social assistance, in accordance with paragraph 29 of the Income Security Recommendation, 1944.(4) Workmen&apos;s compensation should be payable in respect of any occupationalaccident occurring to a child illegally employed; in such cases the employer shouldbe liable for the payment of additional compensation.V. Protection of Young Workers24. The Conference reaffirms its obligation to lay down international standardsfor the protection of young workers with the object of extending and improving the protection of such workers in all types of occupation.
A. Hours of Work25. In order to restrict the working hours of children and young persons within limits compatible with the maintenance of their health and with their recreationaland educational needs, there should be (a) strict regulation of the daily and weekly hours of work, with due regard for the varying needs of young people at different ages; efforts to reduce, in sofar as may be practicable, the working week of young persons and childrennot attending school, to not more than 40 hours;(b) suitable arrangements during working hours permitting young workers to attend the continuation courses of general or technical education providedfor in paragraph 12 above until they attain the age of eighteen years at least,an appropriate maximum being fixed by legislation for the aggregate hours of school and work and an appropriate minimum for the number of hours duringwhich young workers should be released in every day, week, month or yearto attend school, these hours being preferably paid as working time.B.  Night   Work26. In order to protect all young workers under eighteen from the adverse effects of night work, which include undue fatigue and interference with thetime normally free for recreational and cultural activities, measures should betaken (a) to prohibit night work in industrial employment, at least to the extentto which such work is prohibited by the provisions of the Night Work (YoungPersons) Convention, 1919, which requires a rest period of at least elevenconsecutive hours including the interval between ten o&apos; clock in the evening and five o&apos;clock in the morning for young workers under eighteen years ofage; with additional limitations for children and young persons below the ageof sixteen years to cover a consecutive rest period of at least twelve hours,and to undertake a thorough examination of the cases in which night work is authorised for young persons over sixteen for continuous processes in prescribedindustries in order to limit such exceptions to the indispensable minimum andto eliminate them so far as possible;(6) to prohibit night work in agricultural undertakings by requiring restperiods not shorter than those provided for in the Night Work of children and Young Persons (Agriculture) Recommendation, 1921; and(c) to prohibit night work in non-industrial occupations in a manner whichis adapted to the conditions and takes into account the special risks involvedin non-industrial night work for children and young persons of different age groups.C. Rest Periods and Holidays27. In order that all young workers may enjoy daily breaks, weekly restperiods and annual holidays of sufficient duration to restore the loss of physical and mental energy resulting from continued employment, young persons undereighteen years of age, irrespective of occupation, should be assured:(a) regular breaks during working hours and a rest period of a fixed minimumlength allowing sufficient time for a meal in the middle of the working period;(6) a weekly rest period in every week without exception which shouldwhenever possible be of 36 hours and should in all cases include 24 consecutivehours; the rest period should normally include Sunday or the day establishedby the traditions or customs of the country or district, and the substitution of another day for the weekly rest should be limited to cases in which suchsubstitution is authorised by the competent authority as being in the publicinterest and should be authorised only on condition that a longer compensatoryrest period is granted.(c) annual holidays with pay, of a minimum duration of (i) twelve working days per year taken in a single period for all young workers and apprentices under eighteen years of age in accordance withthe principle already established for young workers and apprentices under
sixteen years of age in industry and commerce by Article 2 (2) of the holidays with Pay Convention, 1936, except that the one year periodof service therein referred to need not be continuous; and(ii) eighteen working days per year for young workers engaged in par-ticularly unhealthy or exacting occupations.D. Industrial Safety and Hygiene28. Without prejudice to the fixing of a higher age of admission for certainoccupations especially hazardous to life and health, as provided for in paragraph19 (8) above, special conditions of employment should be prescribed for children and young persons engaged in occupations which involve special hazards to the health and safety of the young worker; to this end measures should be taken:(a) to arrange for the inclusion in the curricula of elementary schools andcontinuation courses of lessons in accident prevention and first aid and to givesystematic instruction in accident prevention in vocational schools of all gradesas recommended in paragraph 13 of the Prevention of Industrial AccidentsRecommendation, 1929, and in the Vocational Education (Building) Recom-mendation, 1937;(b) to make employers responsible for providing for young workers in-planttraining in safety methods and supervision, by the following means:(i) information on the general arrangements in the undertaking for preventing accidents and promoting safety;(ii) explanation of the possible dangers of the work, or the machineryor plant connected with the work, and precise training in the use of machines and tools so as to ensure that the young worker knows how to work safely before he is permitted to start on the job;(iii) experienced supervision to inculcate safe working habits and ensurethat the young worker uses guards and protective equipment correctly,avoids work postures likely to cause physical deformation, and observesall safety rules and practices; and(iv) enforcement of particularly rigorous measures of hygiene in workplaces where there is a danger of industrial poisoning or disease;(c) to fix shorter working hours or provide more frequent breaks for youngpersons engaged in exacting occupations;(d) to require a renewal of medical examinations at shorter intervals in thecase of young persons engaged in occupations which are unhealthy or exacting.E. Moving of Loads29. In order to protect young workers from exertion beyond their physicalstrength, the lifting, carrying, drawing or pushing of loads which are unreason-ably heavy in view of the age and sex of the child or young person should be prevented by (a) prescribing the maximum weight of loads which a young worker maymove or carry by his own efforts, having regard to the age and sex of the worker and to the conditions in which the work is done, as for example, the characteristics of the load, temperature and ventilation of work place, the distance covered, the gradients climbed, the heights at which the load ispicked up and deposited, the technical method of transport, the frequency and length of the exertion and the physical development of the workers in relationto the weight of the load;(b) prohibiting the employment of children and young persons in work whichconsists essentially in carrying heavy loads; and(c) promoting the use of mechanical devices to reduce the physical effortrequired in moving loads and of safe methods of lifting loads.F. Wages30, Provisions with reference to wages paid to young workers should havethe objective of assuring that they are paid wages commensurate with the workperformed, observing wherever possible the principal of equal pay for compar-able jobs.
