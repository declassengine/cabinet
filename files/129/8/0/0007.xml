THISJDOGUMENT^IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.......^.      ^Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1946.Copy No.     3 8CP. (46) 107.12th March, 1946.CABINET.THE NELSON PENSION.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1.   On the 6th November Mr. Wilson Harris asked me : &quot; What is the total sum paid in annuities to the descendants of thebrother of Horatio, Lord Nelson; and whether, in view of the fact thatthe present beneficiary has no issue, he will consider terminating thearrangement ?&quot;I replied as follows : &quot; The total sum paid by the taxpayers since 1806, when this annuitywas instituted, is  700.000. It is, I think, high time that the present arrangement was reconsidered and I propose to take the matter up with thepresent Lord Nelson.&quot;The following supplementary Questions were also asked : Mr. Wilson Harris. &quot; Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that, with hisdying breath, Lord Nelson commended to the generosity of his countrysomeone quite other than the Rev. William Nelson, D.D. 1&quot;Mr. Gallacher. &apos;: Will the Chancellor see to it that there is no questionof buying this present gentleman out, as was proposed in a previous instance,because, if he is bought out, the Chancellor knows that he will remain in justthe same position ? &quot;2. I immediately gave instructions for discussions to be entered into by theTreasury Solicitor with Lord Nelson&apos;s solicitors.3. As a result of the discussions I am satisfied that the only satisfactory way to deal with the matter is by a hybrid Bill which would terminate the annuity.As the present Earl is 89 and his heir, his brother, 86 I propose that the Billshould provide for the termination of the annuity upon the death of the presentEarl, or his brother if he survives him.4. The Bill should also provide for the removal of the statutory restrictionson the disposal of the Trafalgar Estate, which was bestowed on Lord Nelson&apos;sbrother and his heirs under the Act of 1806. by which the annuity was alsogranted. The Act imposes restrictions upon the disposal of the estate, which is vested in certain Official Trustees, namely, the Speaker, the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the First Lord of the Admiralty. If the annuityis terminated, I think it would be right to release the estate from these restrictions and put it in the same position as an ordinary settled estate under the SettledLand Acts.5. I shall be glad of formal authority to arrange for the drafting of thenecessary Bill. I do not ask for any ruling at the present time as to the date whenthe Bill can be introduced.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,12th March, 1946.[31458]
