3CCBMBHT IS THE PROPERTY OP His BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)^?.(46)  13430TH MARCH, 1946COPY NO.CABINETSARAWAKMemorandum by the Lcrd chancellor the State of Sarawak was founded by James Brooke in 1841,He was the first Rajah.      By his Will he settled the sovereignty of Sarawak and all rights and privileges belonging thereto upon his nephow (who became the second Rajah)  and the heirs male ofthe body of the nephew with ultimate reversion to the EnglishCrown.      This created the constitutional succession to theRajahate of Sarawak.2,     James Brooke died in 1868 and was succeeded by his nephewCharles Brook who reigned until his death in 1917.      Charles Brookhad three sons, of whom the eldest Charles Vyner Brook is thethird and present Rajah and the second, is Captain Bertram Brooke..The present Rajah has daughters but no son:    Bertram Brooke has taken Anthony Brookei     Bertram Brooke and his son are thereforenext in succession as Rajahs of Sarawak.3.     The second Rajah left a Will made in 1913 by which (a)  inconfirmation of the Will of his predecessor he bequeathed the sovereignty of Sarawak and all its rights and privileges toCharles Vyner Brooke and the heirs male of his body with remainderto Bertram Brooke and the heirs male of his body with ultimatereversion to the King cf England, and (b) appointed Bertram Brooketo a position of authority in the Raj of Sarawak second only tothat of the eldest son and gave him powers that in effect madehim Vice-Rajah.      In particular he enjoined that &quot;no materialdevelopments or changes in the State or in the Government thereof... shall be initiated by my son Vyner without first consultingwith my son Bertram&quot;.4,      It is alleged by Bertram Brooke that when the present Rajahsucceeded in 1917 he swore in his Coronation Oath to observe theconditions of his Father&apos;s Will,      It is therefore the fact that under the Wills Bertram Brooke and his son are next in succession to the throne of Sarawak.5.      In 1941, a few months before the Japanese invasion,  theRajah proclaimed a new Constitution for Sarawak.      Its main features were to vest the Rajah&apos;s powers and prerogatives inthe Rajah and a Supreme Council jointly, and to vest thelegislative power in the Rajah and a Council Negri,  composedpartly of members of the Sarawak Civil Service and partly cfnominated representatives of the different races native toSarawak.By Section 18 of the new Constitution it is provided asfollows:-&quot;If the Rajah shall die the person who shall have beenproclaimed Heir to the Raj of Sarawak shall be proclaimedRajah of Sarawak by the Supreme Council&quot;,

It is to bo noticed that no prevision is made as tc who shall be proclaimed or as -go the manner in which he shall benroclalmed.      On the other hand, it must be conceded that ifthis constitution is to be regarded as a new constitutionbringing in a system of government such as we are familiarv.-ith in Western Europe it would give complete powers to regulate the succession in disregard of the wills in whatever way might be thought proper.6.     The only other thing to mention as a matter of history isthat in 1338, when His Majesty&apos;s Government undertook responsibilityfor the control of Sarawak&apos;s foreign relations, it was agreedthat internal administration should be left entirely in the handscf the Rajah, but that any question relating to the successionshould be referred tc His Majesty&apos;s Government for decision.7.     His Majesty&apos;s Government have recently announced that thepresent Rajah desires to cede the State of Sarawak to HisMajesty and that His Majesty&apos;s Government are ready to accept this cession if it is in accordance with the will of the peopleof Sarawak that it should take place.     The present proposal is to constitute a Trust Fund providing an income of about  30,000a year for the benefit of the Rajah, his wife, Bertram Brooke,Anthony Brooke (and possibly other Dependants)  and native chiefs.Any residue is to be used for the social and educationaladvancement cf the people of Sarawak.     His Majesty&apos;s Governmentvlll take ever the Sarawak State funds which amounted in february to some two and three quarter million pounds.8.     This arrangement has, of course, two consequences.      It addsSarawak to the British Colonial Empire and it ends the rule cfthe Brooke family in Sarawak.      The questions are distinct,though they are inter-related.      There is likely to develop acontroversy if any such arrangement is come to without theconcurrence of Bertram Brooke, the presumptive successor.9.     Bertram Brooke and his sen contend that   it is not the genuinewish of the people cf Sarawak that the period cf Brooke rule shouldbe ended or that Sarawak should become part of His Majesty&apos;sDominions.     They are taking up the position that if they are allowed to go out to Sarawak and. put their point of view beforethe people they will abide by Liny decision which may bo-reached.10.    I regard the question as not so much a matter of law as amatter of morals and fair dealing.      It is not unnatural that thepresent Rajah, having only daughters, should not take a keeninterest in the succession.      On the oth^r hand he inheritedfrom his father under the terms cf a Will which it is said heswore to observe.      It is equally not unnatural that BertramBrooke and his son who are the successors under the Will should endeavour to uphold the terms thereof.      If the new constitutionreally effected a break with the past and created a legislativebody, such a body can of course disregard the wills.      It willbe argued, however, that any body set up by that constitution isin fact subservient to the Rajah and will do what he wishes.11.    It is desirable under these circumstances if at all practicable that all steps should be taken to prevent BertramBrooke and his son from having a grievance.It may be practicable to allow Bertram Brooke to go outtc Sarawak to present his point of view.     He would, I understand,

prefer to out with his son - hut would certainly want to takecut advisers with him.      He may however he prevented from goingcut by reasons of health.      I would suggest that if facilities are given him to go out it should bo on the plain understandingthat he agrees to abide by any decision come to by the Councilsthere.12.    If this is thought to be undesirable it may be that itwould &quot;be practicable to get Bertram Brooke to agree to a&quot;bideby the result of an arbitration in this country which might heset up to consider &quot;what in fairness and good conscience shouldbe done in the premises&quot; though this solution would involve a delay in making any arrangements for the territory.IS,    I feel confident that if we are to aviod trouble in thismatter it is essential that not only should justice be donebut that justice should appear to he done,     We cannot - whatever the real facts may be - allow our detractors to say that we havebeen guilty of sharp practice in acquiring territories which havenot previously belonged to us.14.    I can well understand and sympathise with the position ofthe Colonial Office.      Their sole desire is to inaugurate some system which will improve the conditions of life of theinhabitants of Sarawak and to bring the administration of theterritory at least up to the level of that obtaining in othercomparable colonial territories.(Inld.)
