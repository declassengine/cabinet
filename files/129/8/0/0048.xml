^J-cJ^d ./0,,Lf,LfC       A/ A .-    257HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENSECRETCP. (46)  14610TH APRIL,   1946COPY NO.   1^CABINET:a,ges foltcyMemorandum by the Secretary cf State forForeign affairs have been giving considerable thought to the questionof wages policy as set forth in CP. (46)130 and there are-certain features of it which, I think, if adopted will cause the Government considerable difficulties.    The first is the  suggestion that the Federation of British industries should be brought in to discuss wages.      The F.B.I.represents commerce;    it includes individual firms aswell as a number of Employers&apos; Associations and is not theappropriate body to deal with labour matters.     This isthe function of the British Employers Confederation.2.     There has been a good deal of thought given tothe question of wages policy over the past years and our experience has shown that it was bettor to keep wagediscussions with the Employ.rs&apos; Associations and theTrade Unions cone -rned than to take them up between theT.U.C  and the Confederation cf Employers.      I would assuremy colleagues that  if there is any attempt to create a central authority to discuss the actual wages and conditionsof members of the Unions, then conflict will ariseimmediately, for, he it remembered, the Unions are, under their rules, themselves the responsible negotiatingauthor ity.3.      It may be argued that the proposal only deals witha general approach to establish fundamental principles hutmy experience has been that you cannot separate fundamental principles from the actual details of working conditions,right down to the shop committee.    And the second proposal in the paper for a National Industrial Conference to debate these problems without any executive authority or without means of application of the decisions afterwards,will only create another piece of machinery which will prevent settlement and not aid it.     All this was done atthe end of the last war by Mr, Lloyd George and it turned out a complete fiasco.      Not a single trade in the countryadopted any of the reports and the executives of either side took little notice.      It became a place where peoplewent to make speeches which in the main had a disturbingeffect  and provided no solution.      The body which is established for dealing with what are described as commonproblems between the State and the industry is the joint consultative Committee of the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil and is, in my view, sufficient.      It represents the Confederation of Employers and the T.U.C.  and theywork within a very limited hut important reference and at

On theother hand,  the very voluntary nature of the body causesfar more attention to be given to    its conclusions andin my view this body has proved that it clearly meets thesi that ion.4,      Then there is the further suggestion that ministers should attend and turn it into a tripartite discussion which would mean certain Ministers dealing with theproblem which must be the obligation of the G-overnmentas a wholei      The method,employed both before and allthrough the war was that the Minister of Labour was responsible, cut when there were things on the agendawhich affected other Departments, those Ministers or their representatives were invited tc attend meetings and deal with them.      In this way the responsibilityof the appropriate Minister was preserved and a very effective instrument was maintained.5.      Lastly, I would, urge that we hesitate beforeestablishing any more machinery in the industrial field.      If anything,  there is toe much now which makes the handling of disputes painfully slow.
