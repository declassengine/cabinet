CIRCULATED. 3 8:^^(0   vqifHiS document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1946Copy No.CABINET.CALL-UP OF APPRENTICES.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply.IN his Paper M.P. (46) 19 to the Man Power Committee, the Minister ofILabour and National Service expressed most strongly the view that we should not be able to justify to the House of Commons or to the country the continued call-I up of students and apprentices until the end of 1947 on a wartime basis and thatj we should decide now that, as from the 1st January, 1947, all industrialI apprentices and non-university students should be allowed to postpone their military service until they have completed their training.   At the meeting of theI Man Power Committee on the 15th March the Parliamentary Secretary to theI Ministry of Supply and Aircraft Production strongly supported this in regard toengineering apprentices, pointing out that the proposal of the Man PowerWorking Party that virtually all apprentices should be called up at the age of 18before they had completed their apprenticeship would inflict a lasting injury onthe engineering industry on which we depended so greatly for our industrialrecovery and our war potential.2. The Man Power Committee, nevertheless, agreed to recommend to theCabinet the adoption of the Working Party proposals in this matter, coupled,however, with a further recommendation to the Cabinet that &apos;&apos; when the announce-ment was made about call-up to the Forces in the transitional period it shouldbe stated that the Government proposed to require industry to overhaul theapprenticeship system so as to bring it more into ^ine with the conditions created by the raising of the school age, the increased provision of technical education and the continuation of compulsory military service.&quot; They also invited theService Ministers to consider what further steps could be taken to enableapprentices who were called up to continue their training during their militaryservice.3. I would urge that before a final decision is reached in this matter furtherconsideration should be given to the implications of these proposals as they affect,through the engineering and iron and steel industries for which I bear primary responsibility, both the national economy and the national war potential. I hopethat what I have to say on this will not be taken as indicating any lack of apprecia-tion on my part of the importance or the difficulties of securing a proper provisionof man power for the armed forces.4. I do not think that it is necessary for me to stress the major and indeedpredominant part which the above industries must play in the restoration ofour economy or in supply in time of emergency. As we are concerned here, how-ever, with the ability of this country to meet its commitments in the realm offoreign policy, I may perhaps be permitted to suggest that in the long term our ability to command respect in tlhe counsels of the nations will deperd in no smallmeasure on the success which we achieve in recovering our position as a leadingindustrial Power. Any call-up arrangements which struck at the root of thatrecovery would, therefore, defeat their own fundamental objective.5.   My concern is not at the call-up of young men from industry as part ofa universal scheme of compulsory military service but at the call-up of apprenticesT31544]15SECRET.CP. (46) 126.-2$th March, 1946.
before they have completed their apprenticeship. Such a course in my view cannotfail adversely to affect that flow of skilled labour into industry which it is vitalfor us not only to maintain but to strengthen. The prospect of a break of two years or so in the third or fourth years of apprenticeship is bound to deter many new entrants to apprenticeship and to drive many of them into blind alley occupations(there is evidence that in the engineering industry it is already doing so); those already apprenticed will be less likely to return after military service than ifthey had already completed their apprenticeship.6. I note that the Service Ministers are invited to consider what further steps could be taken to enable apprentices who are called up to continue their training during their military service. It has, however, been made clear thatany such measures which can be evolved are bound to be limited in their applica-tion. I consider, therefore, that the possibility of continuance of apprenticeshiptraining during military service should be taken into account only when andin so far as it is firmly established that satisfactory arrangements are possible.7. I note also that it is hoped, by shortening the period and adjusting theage rules for apprenticeship, to enable youths to start on leaving school at 15 andto complete their apprenticeship, before call-up, at or shortly after 18. Thiswould reduce the period of engineering apprenticeship from five to three years.I should have thought it open to serious doubt whether this is possible withoutviolence to existing standards. Certainly a solution which materially loweredthe standard of apprenticeship training would be open to the same fundamentalobjection as one which reduced the supply of trained apprentices. I cannot seethat the principle of universal military service or, in the long run, the intaketo the armed forces will be adversely affected by allowing certain predeterminedsections of the community to be called up at 19 or even 20 instead of 18 and Ishould view with alarm, therefore, any attempt to make apprenticeship trainingconform, contrary to other weighty considerations, which may exist, to a universalcall-up at or about 18. I sincerely hope, therefore, that before a decision is reached on this or any announcement made it will receive the fullest consideration inconsultation with employers and trade unions.8. I have dealt above with the longer-term issues, but I believe that failure to introduce the above measures of protection for appi*entices for the next year or so would also have unfortunate consequences. The call-up during this period not only of those who had just completed their apprenticeship but also of thoseattaining the age of 18 will involve abnormally high withdrawals from industry(and particularly from the engineering industry) at this critical stage when ithas the task not of maintaining but of acquiring momentum and would, more-over, throw out of balance for some years the ratio of apprentices to journeymen.It could hardly fail to be regarded by industry as a retrograde step incompatible with a serious determination on the part of the Government to help them to fulfil the urge for greater output and higher productivity. Of the choice of two evils,I find it difficult to believe that the loss to the armed forces of some 60,000 to70,000 raw levies during the next year or two would be more serious to thecountry than the loss to our industrial economy if a corresponding number of apprentices were called up before completion of their apprenticeship. should we not consider a third alternative which might do least injury to the national interest, viz. : some relaxation, as a stop-gap measure, of existing rules limiting the acceptance of volunteers for the armed forces 1 I understand, for example,that, except for re-engagement at the end of service, volunteers over the age of30 are not accepted.J. W.Ministry of Supply,28th March, 1946.
