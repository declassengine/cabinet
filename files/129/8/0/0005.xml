(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC i/lAJESTY&apos;SGOVEPJ^iENT)SECRETCP. (46) 10512th Harch. 1946 COPY NO    %gcapmptlocation of the heallojapteps of the political_RESIDENT IN TPS, PaEGlAN GULF_Memorandum bv the Secretary of State for indian paragraph 3 of his Memorandum of the 8th Marchcp. (46) 101 the Foreign Secretary states that he haswritten to me about his proposal to remove the Headrumrto.r.0of the Political Resident, in the Persian Gulf from rlnpui.ro.In my interim reply to his letter i informed him that iwas In consultation with the Government of India on thismatter and that I was awaiting a statement of their views.My Colleagues will appreciate that the Government of India,for obvious reasons, political, commercial and strategic,due to geographical factors, are closely concerned in any development affecting the position in S. Persia and thePersian Gulf:   they have a specially intimate concern inthe development now under consideration since the political resident and the Political Agents under his control caremembers of the Indian Political Service, and the. cost ofthe whole of the Establishment concerned with the relationswith the Arab Rulers on the Jest Coast is borne (except-for a contribution in respect of Koweit) by Indian Revenues.2.     Shortly before the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper was circulated I had received a telegram from the Governmentof India (Annex) in the light of&quot;which I was about toPehd him a considered reply.     I now circulate thistelegra.: which explains the grounds for the Governmentof India&apos;s view that the immediate removal of the political resident from Hnphi re, even if it we.ro practicable, isinexpedient and inopportune.Developments in the last decade or two, for instance,n connection with oil and civil air communications, have on the whole tended to increase rather than to diminish&quot;the importance which-has always been attached to ourposition in the Gulf,     In making arrangements for thetransfer of the Headquarters of the Political Resident, itis necessary to pay due&apos; regard to what will best serve our interests on the&quot;Arabian as well as on the Persian side ofthe Gulf.4. I propose that my colleagues should, at this stage,take note of this divergence oi views and agree that thematter should be discussed further between the Foreign

Secretary and. myself in the light of the impendingchanges which constitutional developments in India will entail in the arrangements  or the future control ofpolicy and administration in the Persian Gulf area.P.-L.India Office,12th March, 1946

annex copy OF TELEGRAiI FEDH GOVERNMENT OF INDIA,EETEMAL AFFAIRS DEPT.,T0 SECRETARY OF STATEFOR INDIA, (Repeated to Tehran and political resident in the Persian Oulf. dated 4th naroh.1946IMPORTANT 2212. Your telegram 4190 of February 27thand Prior1s letter 69-S of January 12the Transfer ofPolitical Resident from Busliire.2.     Though we agreed in principle in 1937 to transferof Resident to Bahrain, we questioned advantage of movethen and limited our contribution towards cost to Rupees6 Lakhs out of Rupees 17t Lakhs.    Cost   of permanenttransfer now is likely to be in region of Rupees 50 Lakhs.In view of impending constitutional Changes, with consequent necessity for review of whole question ofresponsibility for policy and staffing of&quot;posts in thePersian Gulf, we are not, repeat not, prepared to commitour   successors to expense of this order on move of necessity of which we are far from convinced.     Noobjection seems to have been raised during the last 20years to presence of Resident/Consul General in Bushireand we deprecate move for no better reason than apprehen-sion (expressed at intervals for many years past and&apos; stillunfulfilled) that such objection will be raised.3.     Even if H.H.G. were willing to meet whole cost,-immediate evaluation of Headquarters from Bushire would inevitably be followed by long delay (possibly 3 years inview of present shortage of materials, equipment and skilled labour) in construction of new buildings on Arabside of the Gulf.     Nowhere on the Arab Coast is adequatetemporary accoinmodatioh ava.i fable and it is impossible forResident properly to discharge his functions from someHeadquarters where he would be completely out of touch withthe personalities and atmosphere of the Gulf.     It, wouldscarcely be less reasonable for&apos; him to conduct his business from London than from Karachi.      Furthermore,Resident&apos;s departure from Gulf, with prospect of absencefor so long a period, would be gravely damaging to our prestige and to H.M.G.ls and our joint organisation for control and influence in sector between Middle EastahdIndia, which 2 wars nave shown to be of vital importance.4,     Viceroy has seen this telegram,
