CIRCULATEDTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT196Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1946.68SECRET.CP. (*6) 136.ith April, 1946.Copy No.CABINET.PARLIAMENTARY WAR MEMORIAL.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.Mr. Eden raised with me recently the question of a War Memorial to theMembers of both Houses who lost their lives in the war.2. The 1914-1918 Parliamentary War Memorial was erected by private sub-scription, organised by a Committee of Members and the Office of Works took over its maintenance. It contains the names of Members and Officers of both Houses,and the sons of Members and Officers, who gave their lives in the war. There wasalso a separate Commons Memorial in the shape of armorial bearings round theGallery of the old Chamber and a separate Lords Memorial.3. I suggest that we should arrange for a Committee of Members from bothHouses to consider the form of any Parliamentary War Memorial. The compo-sition would no doubt be arranged through the usual channels.The questions to be examined by the Committee include : (a) whether there should be a joint War Memorial for both Houses;(6) whether a fresh memorial should be erected (and if so where) or whetherthe 1939-45 names should be added to the existing memorial;(c) whether sons of Members and Officers should be included;(d) whether, as on the previous occasion, the memorial should be financed by private subscription.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S.W. 1.Uh April, 1946.[31596J
