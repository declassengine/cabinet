(46) 125.27th March, 1946.CABINET.THE SOCIAL SURVEY.Note by the Lord President of the Council.THE recommendations of the Official Committee on most of the questions concerning Government Information Services were submitted to Ministers in cp. (46) 54. One matter which still remains to be considered is the future ofthe Social Survey (previously known as the &quot;War-time Social Survey&quot;).The attached report of the Official Committee makes recommendations whichrepresent agreement at the official level between the Departments which haveused or are interested in the work of the Survey.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council,Great George Street, S.W. 1,27th March, 1946.Committee on Government Information Services.THE SOCIAL SURVEY.Report by the Official Committee.1. One of the existing functions of the Ministry of Information whosefuture has still to be decided is that carried out at present by the Social Survey(theword) &quot; War-time &quot; has recently been dropped from the title). This organisa-tion, which is attached to the Ministry of Information (though it has alwaysnominally retained an independent status), was set up in April 1940 to carry outstatistical studies of public opinion, market research studies and other inquiriesof this type on behalf of Government Departments. In June 1941, as a result of criticism that it was being used for &quot; snooping,&quot; the Survey was reorganisedand its scope was confined to making purely factual inquiries. It has been used,for example, by the Ministry of Health in investigating the health of the nation and the efficacy of the Ministry&apos;s health publicity and by the Ministry of war transport in connection with the Road Safety Campaign. Sixteen different departments (see the list in the Annex) in all have used the Survey since itsinception.2. The Departments most interested in this type of research* have been consulted and there is general agreement that a service of this kind will continueto be a valuable asset to Government administration. A number of departments have found the work of the Survey useful, but others have not been entirelysatisfied (possibly to some extent owing to inadequate &quot; briefing &quot; by them); and!t is agreed that substantial reorganisation and closer control are necessary.3. The conclusion seems to be that, while the Social Survey should be kept&apos;D being, it should be made an ordinary branch of the Government Service,forming part of some Government Department.   We have considered to what* Ministries of Agriculture, Education, Food, Fuel and Power, Health, Town and CountryWarming, Works; Medical Research Council, D.S.I.R.; Scottish Office; Board of Trade.[31535]
Department this service could most appropriately be transferred, and have cometo the conclusion that, while not all the work of the Survey is immediately con-nected with the dissemination of information to the public, the most convenientarrangement would be to transfer it, as a common information service, to theCentral Office of Information. As a non-policy-forming office, the CO.I. would maintain the Social Survey to meet the requirements of any Department whichmight require survey work to be carried out. The CO.I. should not be committed to taking over all the existing personnel, as a thorough review of the wholeestablishment will be required. The question whether the CO.I. is the mostsuitable permanent home for the Social Survey would be open to later review inthe light of experience.4. The Social Survey has hitherto been advised on the scientific aspects ofits work by a Scientific Advisory Committee set up for the purpose. This Com-mittee was of value in the early days of the Survey in helping to standardiseits technique and in allaying public criticism of its activities, but recently ithas met very infrequently. I here is some force in the argument that an advisory Committee of standing guarantees the scientific integrity of the Survey,but on the whole we recommend that the Committee should! be dissolved. Itsindividual members should continue to be asked for their advice on aspects ofthe Survey&apos;s work in which they have appropriate experience. Advice shouldalso be sought as necessary from the Central Statistical Office and the Govern-ment Actuary.5. At present some Departments are themselves carrying out survey work with staff maintained for the purpose, while others engage commercial Surveyfirms to undertake such work for them. This lack of co-ordination is likely tobe uneconomical and inefficient, and we suggest that Departments should infuture normally submit all their requirements for work of this kind to the CO.I.As with other CO.I. services it would be open to a Department to make out a case for doing the work itself or through a commercial body, but we recom-mend that in any case all contracts with commercial firms for this work shouldbe placed through the C.O.I. and not by Departments direct.6. The services of the Social Survey will be available primarily to Govern-ment Departments as an allied service and to non-departmental organisations,such as tne Medical Research Council, on repayment. We think, however, thatit may on occasion be in the public interest to extend these facilities, on repay-ment, to non-Governmental bodies, such as the National Council of Social Service,and we recommend that, if applications for such services are sponsored by the responsible Government Department, they should be favourably considered.7. The decision whether or not the reports of the Social Survey should bepublished will need to be made on the merits of each case by the COT. and theDepartment concerned, in consultation. In some cases where ordinary publica-tion is not justified it miay be in the public interest to make the results of the survey available to an outside body, such as a trade association, on payment ofa fee.8. We are not able accurately to estimate the future cost of this service as the figures will depend on the extent of the demand and on the extent towhich &apos; Contracting out&apos;&apos; is approved. The present Budget figure for the social survey is  63,000 a year. We hope that it may be possible to reduce substantially the level of expenditure on this kind of survey work.9.   Our recommendations can be summarised as follows : (a) The functions at present carried out by the Social Survey should betransferred to the Central Office of Information. The organisationand establishment of the existing body should be reviewed and suchpersonnel as it may be desirable to transfer to the COT. should become civil servants. The question whether attachment to the COXis the most suitable arrangement should be open to later review inthe light of experience.(6) The Social Survey should be restricted to meeting approved requests forfactual sociological inquiries from Government Departments, andalso, subject to adequate priority for these requirements, fromGovernmental (but non-departmental) organisations and, in specialcircumstances, from non-Governmental bodies. The work would becarried out for Government Departments as an allied service and forother bodies on a repayment basis.
(C) The Scientific Advisory Committee of the Social Survey should ^bedissolved. Scientific advice should be sought as requisite fromindividuals with appropriate experience, including the head of theCentral Statistical Office and the Government Actuary.(d) Departments will be expected to use the CO.I. for Social Survey work,but if they consider that a particular survey can better be carried outby themselves or by a commercial body, they should be free to make&quot;contracting out&quot; proposals on the same basis as for other CO.I.services. All contracts with commercial firms should be placedthrough the C.O.I.(e) The decision whether to publish a report of the Social Survey will bemade with regard to the circumstances of the case by the CO.I. andthe Department for which the survey was carried out, in consultation.ANNEX.Departments, &amp;c, for which the Social Survey has workedand Examples of Probable Future Inquiries.Ministry of Health : Chief Medical Officer        ......Registrar-general public RelationsDepartment of Health for Scotland :  Housing SectionMinistry of Food : Survey DivisionIntelligence and Statistics   ...Public RelationsMinistry of Agriculture : Economics and Intelligence ...Ministry    of   Town    and    country planning : ResearchPublic RelationsMinistry of Works : &apos;&apos;Chief Scientific AdviserStatistics and Intelligence   ...Department of Scientific and industrial research : The Secretary ...Building Research StationMinistry of Fuel and Power : Intelligence and Statistics  ...Board of Trade : Statistics DivisionPublic RelationsIndustrial Design CouncilMinistry of Labour : Public RelationsIndustrial Health Research Board : The Secretary ...Ministry of Transport ...Central Statistical Office : The DirectorMinistry of InformationNational Health Index.Health  education  (Diphtheria  im-munisation, V.D. education, &amp;c).Dietary surveys (a).Housing studies.Food habits (a).Cooking (a).Food education (a).Food production.Housing studies.Fuel     supply     (shortage,     needs,preferences).Home needs, shortages, preferences (a)Taste and design (a).Industry and workers.Road safety.Direction and effectiveness of publi-city campaigns.(a) Some of these surveys will probably be commissioned to commercial contractors.
