jHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 124.25th March, 1946.CABINET.DESIRE OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TO PUBLISH THEMINUTES OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE COUNCIL OF FOUR OF the paris PEACE CONFERENCE, 1919.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE United States Government have asked for the approval of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the publication, as part of a series of official documents on theforeign relations of the United States, of the minutes of the proceedings of theCouncil of Four of the Paris Peace Conference. The Council of Four, composedof the leading delegates of the United Kingdom, the United States of America,France and Italy, sat from the end of March to the end of June 1919. It was clearly understood at the time that the records of its proceedings, which wereprepared by Sir Maurice (now Lord) Hankey, were in the nature of notes for the convenience of the participants and that they should not be published. Neverthe-less, much has been published (although without official authority), notably byMr. Ray Stannard Baker in the United States of America and by the late lord lloyd George in this country. For some years before the outbreak of war in 1939the United States Government were under pressure in their own country to publishan authoritative version of the proceedings of the Council of Four, and in 1938the Foreign Office informed the United States Embassy in London that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would have no objection to such publication provided theother Governments concerned were agreeable.2. Publication not having taken place before the outbreak of war, HisMajesty&apos;s Government found it necessary, in the altered circumstances, to adopta different line in this matter. The question was referred to the War Cabinetin the summer of 1943, when it wras decided that a determined effort should bemade to persuade the United States Government to refrain from publication^1)The arguments before the War Cabinet in favour of consenting to publicationwere:  (i) the fact that so much had already been published (without authority);and(ii) the records were already available to the enemy, who could make whatuse of them they wished.The main arguments against publication were : (i) the impropriety of official publication of rough notes kept for the con-venience of the statesmen concerned during the lifetime of some of the participants;(ii) the distinction to be drawn between diplomatic correspondence, which isconcerned with the execution of policy, and minutes and memoranda,which relate to its formulation and which might prove misleading whenread many years after by persons not intimately concerned in thediscussions;(iii) the possible use of officially published materials by hostile commentatorsand propagandists;(q W.M. (43) 93rd Conclusions, Minute 6.13221   [31528]
(iv) the possible cramping effect which publication might have upon futurepeace discussions : it might make it more difficult for essential business to be transacted by a small council of the Great Powers, and statesmenon such a council might be reluctant to speak freely, or, alternativelyunwilling that records should be kept of their proceedings; this was regarded in 1943 as the most important objection to publication. -3. The opportunity of the Quebec Conference was taken by Mr. Churchillto speak to President Roosevelt personally on this matter, and as a result thePresident agreed to veto the proposal of his Government.4. With the lapse of time and changed circumstances some of the argumentssuccessfully employed in 1943 have lost their force : (i) the death of Lord Lloyd George detracts from the argument regardingnon-publication during the lifetime of the participants;(ii) we have not objected to the publication by the United States Govern-ment of the minutes of the proceedings of the Heads of Delegations(the successors of the Council of Pour) and are, indeed, proposing toinclude those minutes in our own collection of published documentsillustrating the course of British foreign policy between the two wars;in these circumstances the argument about the difference betweenminutes of proceedings and diplomatic correspondence falls to theground;(iii) hostile propaganda cannot be objected to as harming the Allied war. effort.5. There remains the argument, which weighed most heavily with the WarCabinet in 1943, that publication might hamper the work of current Peace Con-ferences. Experience of such Conferences to date suggest that it is unlikelythat there will develop any body at all parallel to the Council of Four, or thatany record kept by a single secretary will be accepted by the participating countries as having an international status. It is more probable that the recordswill take the form either of a verbatim report, internationally accepted, or ofsummaries kept by each Government for its own purposes as in the cases ofthe meetings of the Big Three and of Foreign Ministers during and since the war.This being so, it may be doubted whether the publication of these documents wouldhave any effect at all on the present negotiations.6. In the changed circumstances, I would find it very difficult to prolongour opposition to publication (which is ultimately inevitable in any case), andI Would deprecate allowing this particular question to lead to any complicationsin our relations with the United States State Department. I therefore recom-mend that I should be authorised to inform the United States Ambassador, inreply to his representations, that His Majesty&apos;s Government no longer desire tooffer any objection to publication of these records.E. B.Foreign Office, 25th March, 1946.
