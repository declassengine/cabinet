(46) 108.13th March, 1946.CABINET.UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE:   SPECIAL  ARRANGEMENTS  FOREX-SERVICEMEN AND INDUSTRIAL WORKERS FROM EIRE.j Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theMinister of National Insurance.AT present National Insurance contributions paid by Eire industrial workersI brought over here during the war or credited to Eire volunteers who enlistedin the United Kingdom Forces will give insurance benefit while the contributors\ are in the United Kingdom, but not while they are at home in Eire. The pointj at issue is whether a special concession should be made in favour of these men\ to enable insurance benefit to be paid to them in Eire on the same terms as itI would have been if they had remained in this country.2. The question was raised as long ago as 1942 and, in spite of the technical: difficulties involved, it was, we understand, the view of the Ministry of Labourand National Service that such a concession should be made. During the warI the question had little practical or immediate importance, but now that hostilitiesi have ceased it has become an urgent one, and, in response to enquiries both in; Parliament and outside, assurances have been given by the Prime Minister andother members of the Government that it is under sympathetic consideration and1 that a decision will be reached at an early date. A copy of the most recent reply given by the Prime Minister on this subject is annexed.3. Following on the Prime Minister&apos;s reply specific proposals made by the; Ministry of National Insurance last November were, at the request of thei Treasury, submitted to the three Service Departments, who agreed with them,; and were then passed on to the Treasury, who in January stated that they could: not be accepted. The reasons given by the Treasury were that &quot; the civilianj workers in particular seem to have no claim. They came here attracted by highI wages, much of which were no doubt remitted to Eire to the benefit of that country\ and the expense of this. We cannot see that we are under any further obliga-I tion, and, while the position of the ex-servicemen may be sentimentally ratherI different, we do not think that as a practical matter distinction could be drawn.! If rights against the Unemployment Fund were to be given to persons leavingi this country after employment or service in the Forces we do not see on whatj ground of principle they could be confined to persons leaving this country to- reside in Eire.&quot;4.   On receipt of this reply we asked the Chancellor to reconsider his view for the reasons given in the following paragraphs.5.   Eire Volunteers. We wish to make it clear that we are advocating this concession in the case of Eire volunteers not in the interests or at the instance\ of the Eire Government, but in our own interest and in those of men who haveshown themselves to be our friends by coming forward without legal compulsion,and in the face of the tacit disapproval of their own Government, to join our forces during the war. The Eire Government are not concerned to look afterthe interests of these men, who, from their point of view, have been guilty of\ leaving Eire to join the service of a &quot; Foreign Power.&quot;  In fact, their only con-! tribution to the problem has taken the form of disqualifying for seven years[31472]
from any employment in or under the Government or any local authoritysome 4,000 ex-servicemen who &quot;deserted&quot; from the Eire Forces to join theUnited Kingdom Forces a measure described in the Dail by the Deputy leader of the Opposition as equivalent to a sentence of seven years&apos; starvation. Themen will enjoy no such protection in seeking work or gaining their employment as is given in this country by the Disabled Persons Employment Act, and the reinstatement and Civil Employment Act. All such privileges, including thearrangement for crediting ex-servicemen with insurance contributions in respectof their period of service, are reserved by the Eire Government for their own defence forces. In the not improbable event of their falling into unemploymentthey will, therefore, be under strong economic incentives to migrate and settle in the United Kingdom, where they would enjoy the benefits of other ex-service-men. Apart from the individual suffering and personal feelings involved, suchan exodus would remove a much-needed stabilising and friendly element whichit is in our interest to maintain in Eire. It would be against the interestsof the United Kingdom and playing into the hands of anti-British elements in Eire if our treatment of these men were such as to give grounds for the charge that we were behaving shabbily towards a class of Irishmen who have given suchsignal proof of their friendship to this country.6. We fully recognise that this state of affairs could not be remedied by sixmonths&apos; unemployment benefit at our expense and that whatever we may do thesemen are only too likely to receive a raw deal in Eire. The object of this proposals is to ensure that the bitterness and resentment which will almost certainly ensuewill be directed not against us but where the real responsibility lies, namely, the eire Government.7. Eire Workers. The case for extending the proposed concession to Eireworkers admittedly rests on different grounds. Unlike the Eire volunteers their claims have been and are being supported by the Eire Government. The Ministryof Labour and the Ministry of National Insurance have all along felt somesympathy for the Eire case. It is true that these men profited by their war work;we, however, not only profited : their services were vital to us; and while no doubthigh wages were an attraction the fact remains that the Ministry of Labour setup special machinery for getting them over here. In these circumstances it seemsto us that in the case of the workers as in that of the volunteers the good nameof the United Kingdom is to some extent involved. At present we are compellingthese workers to pay unemployment contributions, but the moment they becomeunemployed and entitled to insurance benefit we put them across the frontier.This does not appear on the face of it to be a defensible position if publiclychallenged. Finally, it is to be hoped that these workers during their stay over here will have unlearnt many of the prejudices which they were taught and will to that extent, on their return to Eire, contribute to the improvement of relationsbetween the two countries which we have at heart. It seems false economy to run the risk of destroying this good will by sending these men home with a feeling that they have been treated in a manner more worthy of a swindling hotel-keeperthan of the Government of a great and honourable coun&amp;y:------8. As regards the question whether it would be possible to make this con-cession to Eire without extending it to other countries, it is submitted that (a) The case of the Eire volunteer is a special one inasmuch as he had no alternative but to join the Forces of another country if he wished totake part in the war.(b) The case of the Eire worker is also a special one in that he was broughtover here under conditions imposed by virtue of an ad hoc EmergencyRegulation applying only to workers from Ireland.So far as is known, there were no workers brought over from other countries on similar conditions.9.   The Chancellors reply is : &quot;I remain unconvinced.  I appreciate that weneeded this supply of manpower during the war and took steps to attract it, butthe men came quite voluntarily and with no expectation of the concession you!propose.   I also appreciate the need to maintain good relations with Eire, but Ido not think we need carry this to the length of a concession that we should not ibe prepared to extend to other countries.  As regards the Parliamentary position!it is, I think, clear that there is no commitment.   I see no need to appease Eire Iwho played a very poor part in the war, and will in the future need us at least asmuch as we need them.&quot;
10. In the circumstances we feel that we must ask the Cabinet to decide thematter. Our own view is that quite apart from the merits of the case we havenow gone so far that if we do not make a concession we shall be accused of breach of faith.A.J. G.13th March, 1946.Extract from House of Commons Hansard dated 10th December, 1945(Cols. 13-14).Irish Citizens.(Unemployment Benefit.)45. Sir P. Hannon asked the Prime Minister if he has considered the appealsigned by Members of both Houses of Parliament, distinguished officers in theFighting Services and others prominent in public life, on behalf of Irishmenwho fought in the war or who were engaged in war work in Great Britain, for relief from the hardship which will be imposed on such persons in the event oftheir return to Eire through the sacrifice of unemployment benefits to which theyare entitled on demobilisation or termination of service, and what action he proposes to take as a measure of justice in the circumstances.T)he Prime Minister (Mr. A ttlee) : This matter is still under consideration, butit is hoped to reach a decision at a fairly early date.Sir P. Hannon : Will the right hon. Gentleman take into consideration the immense services rendered by these Irishmen in the war and in the productionof munitions in this country, and take steps to protect them from the disabilityunder which they are labouring in returning to Eire?The Prime Minister : Yes, Sir, I will do my best. The hon. Member will realise that we have to consult the Government of Northern Ireland, theDominions and the Government of Eire, and it takes a little time to get it allfixed up; but I can assure the hon. Member that we are pursuing this question and we intend to reach a settlement as soon as we can, although I am afraid itwill take some time.Mr. Gallacher : Is this not a good opportunity for discussing this matterand other important matters with the Leader of the Irish Government?Mr. Speaker : That is another question.we jjut jrou\t llnot Iionjlire; ask
