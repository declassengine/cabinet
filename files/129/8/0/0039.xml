April 1946.The circulation of this paper has/ been sUjpto limitedfor the persona] use of ..TOP SECRET. Copy No.   3 cp. (46) 139.15th April, 1946.CABINET.THE RUHR AND WESTERN GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I HAVE already circulated to my colleagues two papers dealing respectivelywith the Future of Germany and the Ruhr and with the Saar Territory(CP. (46) 156). I have been giving anxious thought to these problems and nowask my colleagues for authority to proceed on the following lines  12. I ask for authority to explore the situation with the interested foreign government on the following general lines, though I would not propose to makeany final commitment until the Dominions have been consulted at the forthcoming imperial Conference: (a) The Ruhr. (i) To explore the situation on the basis of international control over the Ruhr industries without political separation of the territoryfrom Germany on the general lines suggested in paragraph 5 of this paper.Meanwhile officials would be instructed to prepare a detailed plan as a matterof urgency.(ii) As an essential prelude to any long-term arrangement, to proceedwithin the British zone with the interim measures outlined in paragraph 6.(b) The Rhineland. To support the French Governments proposal that french, Belgian and Dutch forces should be stationed in German territory west of the Rhine for an indefinite period, but to resist their proposal for thedetachment of the territory from Germany.(c) The Saar. To agree that the ownership of the Saar mines should betransferred to France, the territory included in the French customs and currencysystem, French military forces stationed permanently in the territory, and theterritory itself transferred forthwith to French administration pending a final settlement. The assets so transferred should be debited to France on reparationaccount.(d) The A merican Draft Treaty. To inform the United States Governmentthat His Majesty&apos;s Government welcome their proposal for a treaty as a most useful basis for discussion.3. My own original proposal was that the Ruhr should remain part ofGermany, but that its industries should be internationally controlled along thelines of a plan prepared by the Economic and Industrial Planning Staff and shownin Annex A to Gen. 121/1 (CP. (46) 156). The following points were raised onthat proposal:  (a) Would my suggestion that the Ruhr should concentrate on semi-finished products and that the finishing industries should be located else wherein Europe be acceptable to other countries and indeed to our own ?(b) Would it be possible to confine to the Ruhr the proposed control overGerman heavy industries ? Might not a central German Government,if left free to do so, build up outside the Ruhr heavy industries whichwere not subject to international control ?13263   [31661] b
id) What would be the relation between the standard of life in the Ruhr andthat in the rest of Germany ?id) Would the local administrative officials and the German workers in the ruhr be likely to adopt a policy of obstruction and passive resistancetowards the International Holding Corporation and to be supportedin this policy by the German Government or administration and by workers elsewhere in Germany ?4.   These points have now been considered with the following results : (a) There is general agreement that from the security angle there would beevery advantage in encouraging the basic industries of the Ruhr upto the semi-finishing stage, leaving the finishing industries to be setup in other parts of Germany and elsewhere in Europe. There is alsogeneral agreement that this should be our aim as soon as the redevelopment of those basic industries is allowed. But for the timebeing we are bound by the level of industry plan approved by theControl Council which restricts production to a level that will bringserious unemployment to the area. This unemployment would beincreased still further if we were now to exclude from the area all theexisting fabricating industries.(b) All heavy industries depend on coal or power, and the Ruhr is the onlyimportant source of these in Germany apart from the brown coalfields in Saxony which cannot provide coking coal for steel production.By controlling the Ruhr coal output we shall control the developmentof the steel industry not only in the Ruhr area but all over Germany.Moreover, it has never been suggested that if a special system ofcontrol is applied in the Ruhr, the development of industry in therest of Germany should be left entirely uncontrolled. The peace treaty will, it is hoped, provide for a thorough system of industrialinspection.(c) It was agreed at Potsdam that Germany&apos;s standard of living should,during the initial period of control, not exceed that of the Europeanaverage excluding the United Kingdom and Russia. The reparationplan agreed at Berlin will ensure that this principle is strictly observed. It is not possible to predict at this stage how the standardof life in the various parts of Germany will develop after the repara-tion plan has been completed. All that can be said is that it will be essential to the success of international control of the Ruhr that thestandard of life in the area should be at least as high as that prevailing in the rest of Germany.(d) All political parties in Germany are deeply hostile to any idea of thepolitical separation of the Ruhr from Germany. Their attitude to international control of the industries is less clear. The best estimateof opinion is that, while the Communists would follow Russianguidance whatever it might be, the democratic parties might be broughtto accept a plan of the kind worked out by E.I.P.S. if it were accompanied by some immediate advantages and could be represented as a step towards Germany&apos;s re-establishment in the Western Inter-national framework. Their acceptance might be facilitated if theplan were modified in the sense set out in the next paragraph.5. Further consideration has been given to the E.I.P.S. paper during thepast few weeks, and I am led to think that the basic conception of international control within the German State might be better implemented on the following-lines. A new German province would be formed in the area affected by the scheme.Instead of the industries being owned internationally they would be made intoa socialised German corporation whose relation to the Provincial Governmentwould be the same as that of the National Coal Board in this country to HisMajesty&apos;s Government. Germany&apos;s obligations in regard to the transferredindustries would be laid down in such detail as was necessary, in the peace treaties, and an international control organisation would be formed to supervise the performance of these obligations. Thus political control, with of course thepossibility of political and military sanctions, would be substituted for industrialcontrol through ownership. My impression is that a scheme of this nature, withits emphasis on political rather than industrial control, would be more acceptable to the French, while German opinion would certainly prefer to see Germanindustries in German socialised ownership rather than owned by an international
corporation. The actual direction of the products of the area into the channelswe desire would have to be brought about by the various interested Governmentsapplying appropriate commercial policies.6. If this sdheme is generally agreed, I should propose to proceed by thefollowing stages. The first step would be to create a new German provincecovering the area to which the scheme is to apply. I am advised that this couldbe done without difficulty by unilateral action on the part of the British Com-mander-in-Chief. The next step would be to set up a provincial administrationof that province, which would have the necessary powers over the proposed Germancorporation to which the industries in the area would be transferred. This willtake some time to achieve, and in the meantime I would propose to follow inregard to the other industries in this area the same policy that has already beencarried out in regard to the Ruhr mines, namely, to vest them as a temporary measure in the Commander-in-Chief, announcing at the same time that1 while their ultimate disposal remains to be decided they will not be returned to their previous owners. Although it is part of the plan that these assets should sub-sequently be transferred to the proposed German corporation, there is some doubt whether this transfer could be effected by the Commander-in-Chief underthe powers which he exercises as a zone commander or whether it would not need the quadripartite approval of the Control Council. This, however, is beingfurther examined and will not affect my immediate proposal. It follows thatduring the early stages the direct control over these industries would be exercisedsolely by the British zone commander, though he would of course be subject toquadripartite control at Berlin in so far as the legislation to deal with these industries is a matter affecting Germany as a whole. Nevertheless, to prepare the way for my ultimate objective of international control I would from the ontsetassociate the Western Powers most closely affected and the United States byinviting them to appoint in the first place advisers to the British officialsnominated as custodians of these industrial assets, and later, when the Germancorporation has been formed, to the British body which will control it. but when the quadripartite control of Germany comes to an end this British body would change into an international organisation on the lines set out in para-graph 5 and at that stage the advisers appointed by our Allies would become fully associated with the control.7. A highly important point for decision is whether the Russians shouldbe admitted into the scheme suggested. My own view is that we should not offer to the Russians in Western Germany any greater facilities than they might beprepared to give us in Eastern Germany, e.g., participation in the international control of the industrial area of Saxony. One may assume that they would not wish to set up such an international control in their own zone. If, therefore, atany time during the evolution of this plan the Russians were to claim the rightto appoint an adviser or an ultimate share in the international controlling body,I should only be prepared to accept this provided that they were to give us similarparticipation in the international control of a similar organisation in their zone.8. In considering this whole problem we must, however, bear in mind thatwe have given our agreement in Berlin to a plan for the future level of german industry the effect of which will be to reduce the level of German industry as awhole to about 50 or 55 per cent, of the 1938 level. The heavy industries are tobe more drastically reduced than others, the productive capacity remaining tothem being of the order of a third of pre-war. This will in particular affect the ruhr where the heavy industries chiefly lie. The plan was accepted by theBritish representative on the clear understanding that it would be open to reviewif any of the basic assumptions of the plan were modified. One of these assumptions related to the German western frontier and it would clearly be modified if the French plan of separating the Ruhr from Germany were accepted.But it would be impossible to call for review on this ground if a system were introduced on the lines favoured by the Committee on German Industry, underwhich the German western frontier would not be changed. Unless, therefore, weare prepared to denounce the Potsdam Agreement and this is a matter whichI propose to discuss in a separate paper on our general policy towards Germany it seems to me that we must proceed on the assumption that the level of industryplan will be carried out. This, I fear, will inevitably postpone for some years any hope of fulfilling one of my principal ideas, which is that the Ruhr should be turned into a positive element of European reconstruction. I have not, however,abandoned this conception and hope that the proposal for controlling the Ruhrwhich I have outlined will enable me to persuade the Russians that a prosperous
and expanding industry in the ruhr may hold out great advantages for them aswell as for the rest of Europe. The full association of the Germans in thedevelopment of their own industry under international control, as this modifiedplan contemplates, seems to me better calculated to achieve this objective thandoes the idea of international ownership which deprives the Germans of an interest in the welfare and well-being of their own industries.9. I took the opportunity of the period required for consideration of thepoints mentioned in paragraph 3 above, to invite the views of the Chiefs of Staffon the strategic aspect of this problem. Their report, of which a copy is attached,may be briefly summarised as follows : Our main strategic aims in Western Europe are that no potentially hostilePower should be in a position to dominate Western Europe and, secondly, thaton the outbreak of any future conflict our strategic frontier should be as far eastas possible. Our policy towards Germany should be guided by the consideration that Russia is our most likely potential enemy and is a more serious danger thana revived Germany. Three proposals for the organisation of the Ruhr are considered and none is thought wholly satisfactory for meeting these aims. Thefirst, namely, that the Ruhr should simply, remain for the time being as part ofour zone of occupation with the control of its industry in our hands, has manyadvantages since it gives us for the immediate future the maximum freedom ofaction and leaves the area and its industry under our control for so long asthe occupation of Germany is maintained. But the necessary corollary of thisproposal is that the Ruhr should be returned to German control when occupationceases. This will be dangerous if Germany is drawn into the Russian orbit.The Chiefs of Staff regard the French proposals as unacceptable. They regard the E.I.P.S. plan as a possible compromise but draw attention to several serious disadvantages in it. The Chiefs of Staff see no objection to the occupationalcommitment involved in the E.I.P.S. plan which wTould amount to 10,000 Britishtroops and which they consider would probably be less than that involved inthe French plan.10. There remain the questions of the Rhineland, the Saar and the draft treaty proposed by the United States Government, the text of which is containedin Annex C of Gen. 121/1 (CP. (46) 156).11. As regards the Rhineland, economic and military arguments have been advanced against the French proposal that German territory west of the Rhineshould be set up as a separate State or States detached from Germany. Frenchideas on this point have been far less definite than their ideas about the Ruhr,and there should not be so much difficulty in reaching agreement with them onthis aspect of their plan provided we can accept their main proposal that their forces, and those of the Belgians and Dutch, should be stationed permanentlyin the area. I would propose that this should be our policy. It is not thought necessary that any British troops should be stationed in this area.12. As regards the Saar, I suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government should support the French proposals and that the assets of the territory transferred to french administration should be debited to the French Government on reparationaccount.  I submit these recommendations to my colleagues&apos; approval.13. The Chiefs of Staff have reported favourably on the American draft treaty and, though certain clarifications are required, I am convinced that thisAmerican initiative is of great importance and potential advantage to ourselves.I would accordingly propose to inform the United States Government that we welcome their proposal and consider it provides a most useful basis for further discussion, subject to the clarification of certain points.E.

ANNEX.CCS. (46) 105 (O).CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.THE FUTURE OF GERMANY AND THE RUHR.Report.WE have examined the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper* and the questions youput forward m your letter, t It is not possible to deal with these without con-sidenng wider questions of our strategic interests in Western Europe.2. It must be assumed that the Silesian industrial area is permanentlylost to Germany. From the point of view of future war potential, the Ruhris by far the most important area of Germany. Deprived of both the Ruhr andSilesia, Germany could hardly count as an independent factor in Europe.From the military point of view, therefore, the future of the Ruhr and the rhineland will largely determine the future of Germany. Thus is becomes necessary to consider what our long-term policy with regard to Germany as awhole should be.Long-Term Policy regarding Germany.3.   Our main strategic aims in Western Europe are that:  (a) No potentially hostile Power should be in a position to dominate western europe.(b) On the outbreak of any future conflict, our strategic frontier should beas far east as possible.The deduction from the above is that we must do our utmost to ensurethat France and the Low Countries remain friendly to us. Our position wouldbe greatly strengthened by the creation of a western democratic Germany. failing this, it is essential that the authority in control in Germany should not be hostile to us.This authority must be that, either of a revived and independent Germany,or of whatever Power might be in a position to exert a controlling influence inGermany. At present it seems that, once the existing system of Allied occupationis terminated the only foreign Power which could establish a controlling influence in Germany would be Russia. Our policy towards Germany should therefore beshaped by whether, in the long run, we regard a revived and independent Germany,or Russia as likely to be the greater danger to our security.It is clear that the worst situation of all, and one which we must try toavoid at all costs, is that of a revived Germany dominated by Russia, since we might then be facing the combined war potential of both Powers.4. If we consider that the principal danger to our security is eventuallylikely to come from a revived and independent Germany, then our policy towards-her should be guided principally by the necessity of keeping her war potentialas low as possible. At the same time, however, we must not drive Germany intothe arms of Russia.Alternatively, if Russia is considered the more serious danger, our policy towards Germany should be such as would not prevent us from building her up again if this becomes necessary. In addition, so that we could count on effectiveGerman assistance in the event of conflict with Russia, we should try to avoidarousing permanent German antagonism towards us.5. The above are questions of the highest policy and are to a great extentpolitical. We consider that it is still too early to decide these issues finally, but,if we have to shape our policy now we can, from the military point of view, chooseonly the second alternative since Russia appears, at present, our most likelypotential enemy.In the event of conflict with Russia we cannot, in view of the man-powerand war potential at her disposal, afford to exclude any method of redressing the* Gen. 121/1 (Annex I to C.O.S. (46) 93 (0)).[31661]t C.O.B. (46) 93 (O).C
balance. Moreover, Germany is so placed strategically that, if she was preparedto resist, she might be able to gain the necessary time for us to develop our owneffort, and for the resources of the United States to be brought into play.6. It would clearly be politically unacceptable, nor is it militarily necessary,to adopt a policy of rebuilding Germany in the immediate future. We consider!however, that our policy should be shaped to give us maximum freedom to do this later in case it should prove to be necessary. Such a course will be subject always to the following provisos : (a) We must be able to carry the United States with us in any proposals we make.(&amp;) We must not so offend France and the Low Countries that we alienatethem permanently.(c) Any arrangement which allows the stationing of Russian forces in western Germany or extends Russian influence is undesirable.(d) We wish to reduce our occupational commitment as far as possible and toavoid a permanent commitment on the continent.(e) Any settlement which does not conform to the spirit of the atlantic charter is unlikely to stand the test of time.7.   In the light of the above oyerall considerations, we examine the points raised by the Foreign Office.Proposed Methods of Control of the Ruhr.Method 1.^Eventual Return of the Ruhr to Germany.8. This gives us for the immediate future the maximum freedom of actionin that it would avoid the necessity of deciding now upon any special long-termregime for the Ruhr, and would leave it under our control as long as theoccupation of Germany is maintained. Moreover, the prospect of the eventualreturn of the Ruhr might divert German attention to the question of the recovery of her next most important lost province, Silesia, and therefore incline Germanyto a policy of collaboration with the West rather than the East. The fact that wewould remain in occupation of the area until it was considered safe to abandon the occupation of the whole country would give us, at any rate for some time, aconsiderable degree of security against a revived and hostile Germany.9.   On the other hand, this plan contains, as a long-term policy, an element of risk in that, should it not achieve its object and should Western Germany in I !,spite of it be drawn into the Russian orbit, Russia would gain the war potential  -of the whole of Germany, including her most important industrial area.  Whetheror not this plan would bring us solid advantages must therefore depend upon gits being accompanied by a positive policy towards Germany which will hold jout real hope for the future to her, and so combat despair and its accompanyingopportunities for Communist propaganda.   This policy should ensure keeping ^at least Western Germany outside the &quot; iron curtain.&quot; -We would relate this policy to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s remarks on the forma- ,tion of a Western &quot; zone,&quot;* and to our views on areas of strategic importance.tIt must not be overlooked that this plan may be expected to be vigorously ^opposed by France.   The risk of alienating her that it involves would have to be faced, and a means found to persuade her that it will be in her long-term interests to accept it. (10. As regard occupational commitments, this plan reduces our long-term Foccupational tasks to a minimum, since, once the occupation of Germany as awhole hand been abandoned, there would be no need for forces of occupation ^east of the Rhine. The reluctance to evacuate the Ruhr might prolong the occupa- 1tional commitments as a whole. On the other hand, it seems to us that the cdecision whether or not to abandon the occupation of Germany as a whole is likely 1to be influenced primarily by other factors. \Method 2.-E.I.P.S. Plan. t11.   This plan has the following advantages : - ^(a) It ensures that sanctions can be applied quickly if the need arises.(p) Our share in the control over the industries of the Ruhr will offer usa certain degree of security whoever may be in control of Germany.(c) French insistence on the separation of the Ruhr appears to be weakening,and they might therefore be brought to accept this plan.(d) It should ensure that United States troops remain in Europe for a  prolonged period.* D.O. (46) 40.f D.O. (46) 47.
(e) If the Russians are included in the plan, they are robbed of their propa-ganda line with the Germans that it is the Western Powers who arescrewing down Germany.12.   The plan has, however, considerable disadvantages : (a) We abandon the position which we hold at present of being the soleauthority in the area.(b) It is doubtful whether the Germans would regard the return of theterritory only, without control of the industries which give it its mainvalue, as a concession of any great consequence.It would not therefore divert German hostility away from theWestern Democracies, and if the Russians are not included in the plan,might drive Germany into the arms of Russia by giving Russia a weapon with which to incite the German population against us.(c) On the other hand, if the Russians do participate in control, it might bedifficult to exclude Russian troops from the Ruhr while allowingforces of the Western Powers to be stationed there.In the event of our being forced to admit Russian troops, it is unlikely that we shall be able to prevent them establishing a Russianzone, and with it a secure base for the conduct of Communisticactivities.(d) International control would be held responsible by the German populationfor any distress caused by slumps, unemployment, &amp;c, and a difficultinternal security problem would therefore exist. This unrest might be exploited to their own ends by the Russian representatives on the controlling body in the Ruhr.(e) There will be an inevitable danger of conflicting economic interestsbetween the controlling Powers, and the consequential danger that inthe course of time one or more Powers might withdraw, causing a breakdown in control.(/) The plan produces an indefinite, though small, occupational commitment.13. With regard to the questions raised by the Foreign Office regardingoccupational commitments, it is not possible to give a firm estimate of the numberof troops required, but the figure of 50,000 quoted for the French Plan seems reasonable. Since the other participating Powers would presumably providecontingents, we should probably have to provide not more than 10,000, and thisis a commitment which could be accepted.The fact that the territory would not be politically separated from germany should render the task of occupation easier rather than the reverse since such aregime would presumably be more acceptable to the population than one involving-complete separation. It should be noted that militarily it would be highly desirable that the area should be extended as has already been proposed,* so as toinclude an area west of the Rhine up to the Dutch frontier. If this is not clonethe Ruhr area would become an island surrounded by potentially hostile territory.Method 3.&apos; French Plan.14. Acceptance of this plan should improve our relations with France.Otherwise it produces no advantages which we cannot obtain under the E.I.P.S.plan, and only accentuates the disadvantages of that plan.The Ruhr will be detached permanently from Germany. The scheme will therefore encounter the bitter hostility of the Germans, and in the passage oftime will fail to retain the continued support of popular opinion in the democracies. It seems to us that German hostility to this plan, combined withthe effect it would have upon German economy, would almost certainly driveGermany into the arms of Russia. Furthermore, the plan would entail an indefinite occupation commitment which, in view of local hostility, would probablybe larger than that required under the E.I.P.S. plan, without any correspondingadvantage from the security point of view. In addition, Russian influence wouldbe allowed to extend into Western Germany.Summary.15 None of the three methods proposed is wholly satisfactory, nor can we at present see any solution to the problem of tJhe ultimate disposal of the Ruhrterritory which fully meets our military requirements. The French plan we regard as unacceptable.* Gen. 121/1, paragraph 42.
From the military point of view, we wish to prevent Western germany from falling under Russian domination. This requirement would be most nearlymet by Method 1, i.e., retention of the Ruhr within our area of occupation andits ultimate return to Germany. The feasibility of tins must, however, depend upon a political estimate of the possibility of keeping at least Western Germanywithin the Western democratic zone, and the plan will clearly raise considerable political difficulties.If Method 1 cannot be adopted, the E.I.P.S. Plan offers a possible compromise.It has, however, the very great disadvantage that it extends Russian influenceinto Western Germany, and leaves the seed of discontent among the local popula-tion, and the danger of future disagreement between the Allies.The Saar,16. The French have a good claim to ownership of the Saar mines andfor the inclusion of the area in their Customs Union. We consider that their demand will be difficult to refuse, and as there are few military implications tothis we should certainly offer no objection on military grounds.Remaining Territory West of the Rhine.17. From the military point of view, we can see little object in setting this area up as a separate State, since at best it can only be a small weak unit whichwould be a continual source of dispute between France and Germany.18. In order to increase our essential security against attack from the east,whether by Germany or Russia, we should support the indefinite maintenance ofFrench, Belgian and Dutch garrisons throughout the area west of the Rhine.This will apply whatever solution is reached with regard to the Ruhr.19. We see no necessity to provide a British contingent in this area. If,however, the provision of such a contingent would mean that the americans would do the same, thereby giving them an indefinite commitment in Europe, wethink we should also be prepared to provide a small force.Conclusions.20.   We conclude that: (a) Our long-term policy with regard to Germany must take full account ofthe fact that Russia is a much more dangerous potential enemy than Germany; it cannot be shaped solely from the point of view of preventing a revival of a threat from Germany.(6) We therefore wish, from a military point of view, to bring about a situation in which Western Germany will not be dominated by Russia.(c) In the light of the above, the implications of the three solutions proposed for the Ruhr are as follows : (i) Provided we can obtain American co-operation and can convince the French that it is in their long-term interest to agree, and provided that it is coupled with a positive policy towards germany that Avill ensure at least Western Germany remainingwithin the western democratic zone, Method 1 most nearly meetsour military requirements,(ii) Method 2 (E.I.P.S. Plan) presents a compromise but only at theprice of Russian participation, to which we are most strongly opposed.(iii) Method 3 (French Plan) is unacceptable.(d) There are no military objections to acceptance of the French proposals with regard to the Saar.(e) We should only support the French proposals that French, Belgian and dutch garrisons should be maintained indefinitely in German territorywest of the Rhine if the Ruhr and the adjacent Rhineland are also tobe occupied by Allied Forces.(Signed)      ALANBROOKE.TEDDER.RHODERICK R.
