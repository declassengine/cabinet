THIS DOCUMENT IS the PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT210Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1946. ^SECRET. Copy No. ,38CP. (46) 140.5th April, 1946.CABINET.SEA PASSAGES FOR CIVILIANS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN his paper of the 29th March (CP. (46) 132) the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for India has drawn attention to the urgent need for theprovision of increased facilities for the transport of civilians from India to thiscountry.2. The need for the provision of shipping for the transport of passengersto and from the Colonies is equally urgent. Passenger shipping to and from theColonies has been severely restricted both during and since the war with theresult that there are large numbers of civilians awaiting transport both to andfrom the Colonies. Many of these are persons who, owing to war-time exigencies,have been separated from their wives and families for long periods, or who, havingbeen resident overseas, have been unable to enjoy normal recuperative leave in atemperate climate, with consequential detriment to their health and efficiency.Others have accepted employment in the Colonies and are anxious to arrangefor their wives and families to join them. Owing to the increased costs of living and to the difficulties of finding accommodation, the problems of separation giverise to real difficulties and in some cases to actual financial embarrassment. Inmany cases, employees of Government or of commercial firms have threatenedresignation if shipping facilities for their families cannot be provided. Theeffect on morale and efficiency is serious, and discontent is increasing.3. There are at the present time over 7,000 persons awaiting transport tothe Colonies. I attach a tabular statement showing the numbers awaitingtransport to the principal areas concerned. I have recently asked colonial governments for detailed information as to the numbers awaiting transport fromthe Colonies to this country, and though full information on this subject is notyet available, present indications are that the numbers awaiting transport tothis country are even greater than the numbers awaiting transport to the Colonies.4. I am convinced that if administration and production are to be efficientlymaintained and the export drive is to have a chance of success, early provision must be made to provide opportunities of recuperative leave for those who have spent long periods in tropical areas and to enable wives and families to join their husbands. I therefore strongly support the suggestion that civilian passagerequirements should now be accorded greater priority than has been possible inrecent years, and that the Ministry of Transport should be directed to give early consideration to the provision of shipping to meet civilian needs.G.
