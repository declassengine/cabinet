fHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT-&quot;   129Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1946.SECRET. Copy No. 3 cp. (46) 119.2lst March, 1946.CABINET.USE OP THE VETO IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 18th February I suggested to my colleagues that this question might with advantage be reviewed in the light of developments at the recent series of meetings of the Security Council which had shown or appeared to show that (a) in the case of Greece, the Soviet Delegation had used its right of veto toprevent a resolution by the Council exonerating His Majesty&apos;sGovernment;(&amp;) Any Great Power could bring before the Council a situation, to whichit was not a party and then veto a decision on that situation, whichwas disagreeable to itself;(c) In general it seemed that, the veto would be used not only to preventsanctions against a Great Power, but as a tactical weapon influencing the decisions of the Council on its procedure.2. The Cabinet agreed to consider at an early meeting the points whichI had raised about the procedure of the Security Council.3. I am advised that without an amendment to the Charter there is onlya limited improvement that can be effected with regard to the veto. Any amend-ment requires the agreement of all five of the permanent members of the security council. I feel certain that to propose any amendment at the moment would do more harm than good to this prospect of the United Nations Organisation.4. The situation may be somewhat improved if we can succeed in gettingadopted some additional rule of procedure, supplementing Article 34 of the charter by a definition of what constitutes a &quot;dispute&quot; as distinct from a&quot; situation.&quot; We should try to make this definition as wide as possible, since theveto is limited automatically by the provision in Article 27 (3) that parties to a&quot;dispute&quot; shall not vote when a question is classified as a &quot; dispute.&quot; this limitation does not exist when a matter is classified as a &quot; situation.&quot;5. An additional rule of procedure is suggested under (a) in the Annex tothis paper, to the effect that there is a dispute whenever one State brings beforethe Council allegations against another State and the latter State contests theseallegations. We must realise that this new rule would cut both ways. It wouldhave deprived M. Vyshinsky of a veto on the Council&apos;s recommendationsrespecting Persia and Greece. But it would also have deprived us of our potentialveto over Indonesia and it might operate to do the same in the future if casesarose over Egypt and India which were introduced into the Council by someState other than Egypt or India. (If Egypt or India introduced the matter thecase would probably be a dispute under any conceivable rule and therefore HisMajesty&apos;s Government would not have a veto anyway.) However, I do not believethat we could afford to stand out alone against a recommendation endorsed byseven members of the Security Council, including all the other four permanent members, and on balance I believe that the adoption of the proposed definition ofa dispute would be to the advantage of ourselves as well as of the United nations organisation. The proposed rule proceeds on the basis that a state which allegesthat another is guilty of conduct prejudicial to peace is levelling a most seriousinternational charge and should therefore be prepared to submit to its adjudica-tion without having the veto on the result.13214   [31513]
6. This additional, rule of procedure would not help to avoid the techniqueby which a Great Power brings an accusation against another Great Powertnrough a satellite. Indeed, by making more precise the definition of a &quot; dispute &quot;the new rule would encourage this mode of attack ie.g., as practised by theSoviet Union through the Ukraine against the United Kingdom at the first session of the Security Council), since if the matter were deemed to be a&quot; dispute,&quot; the first Great Power would retain its vote and veto while the second would lose them both. I fear we must accept the fact that if a Great Powerwishes to abuse the spirit of the Charter in this way, there is no rule ofprocedure or other device which could stop her.7. It is possible that an additional rule of procedure requiring a com-plainant to furnish a full written statement of his case at the outset would help to discourage fictitious cases being brought before the Council. At least it would ensure that Delegates were fully apprised of the case with which they had todeal before the discussions began, and help them to see at the outset whether a complaint really related to a matter affecting international peace and security.I consider that we might try for such a rule of procedure in the terms shown under (b) in the Annex. I would not be in favour of requiring the defendant toproduce a written reply to the complainanfs charges, as this might be used asan excuse to delay proceedings before the Council in a serious and urgent matter.8. If my colleagues agree, I would propose to authorise Sir A. Cadoganto put forward these two additional rules of procedure, after discussing the matter with his United States colleague.E. BForeign Office, 21st March, 1946.ANNEX.Possible additional Rules of Procedure for the Security Council.(a) Definition of a &quot; dispute.&quot;In deciding under Chapter VI of the Charter whether a matter brought before the Security Council by a State is a dispute, or a situation, the security council shall hold that a dispute arises (i). if the State or States bringing the matter before the Security Council,and the State or States whose conduct is impugned, agree that thereis a dispute;(ii) whenever the State or States bringing the matter before the Councilallege that the actions or intentions of another State are endangeringthe maintenance of international peace and security, and the state or States which are the subject of these allegations contest the factsor inferences to be drawn from such allegations,(iii) Further, if a State bringing a matter before the Council alleges that another State is violating the rights of a third State, and the lattersupports the contention of the first State, then the third State shall also be deemed to be a party to the dispute.(b) Submission of cases in writing.Any State bringing a dispute or situation before the Security Council shallfurnish a full written statement of the grounds of fact and law on which itscase is based, for circulation to members of the Council before the discussion isopened.
