(45) 349)drawing attention to certain submissions made to me by the National Union of mineworkers and the implications thereof.I now attach for the information of my colleagues the twelve-point Miners&apos;Charter of demands sent to me by the National Union of Mineworkers(Appendix I); and also my reply to the President of the National Union of mineworkers (Appendix II).E. S.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S. W. 1,ISth March, 1946.APPENDIX I.Recruitment Charter of Demands.The Minister of Fuel and Power having raised with the National Executive-Committee of the National Union of Mineworkers the question of the recruitment of man power to the coalmining industry, and the Committee having undertaken to give it the most serious consideration, has now arrived at the following conclusions : In the view of the National Executive Committee, the extent to which thefollowing changes are introduced will determine the rate of entry of new recruitsto the industry : (1) The modernisation of existing pits and the sinking of new ones as rapidly as possible whilst strictly observing as a minimum the standards laid down in theReid Committee Report; the provision of adequate compensation for those whobecome redundant; and at the same time aiming at the general application of theday-wage system.(2) The adequate and careful training of youth in the various phases of mining operations, and the establishment of a clearly defined scheme of promotion;the provision of further training and tuition required in cases where workersdesire to enter for a colliery technician&apos;^ career.(3) The introduction of new safety laws to meet the conditions of modemmining and especially to suppress the development of industrial diseases.(4) The payment of compensation rates to meet incapacity due to industrial injury or disease which shall guarantee the injured person from financial loss ;andthe provision of &quot;an adequate income for the dependants of those killed as a sresultof injury or who die from an industrial disease. (This paragraph will requireto -conform to the policy on Workmen&apos;s Compensation, .as is accepted by -theNational Executive Committee at its meeting to be held this week).(5) The average wage standards shall not be permitted to fall below those ofany other British industry.[31497] &apos; b
(6) The restoration of the 7-hour day for underground workers; the intro-duction of the 40-hour week for surface workers; and the establishment of the5-day week without loss of pay.(7) The continuation of the principle of the guaranteed weekly wage whenthe Essential Work Order is withdrawn.(8) Payment to be made for two consecutive weeks&apos; holiday and six statutoryholiday days in each year.(9) The provision of pensions for mineworkers who cease to be able to followtheir employment after 55 years of age and the payment of a subsidiary pensionfrom the industry in addition to pensions provided from other legal enactments.(10) The building of new towns and villages of a high standard and situateat places calculated to enable miners to have increased opportunities for socialfacilities and to break down the segregation of mineworkers and their familiesfrom the rest of the community, accompanied by the provision of adequatetz-transport services at reasonable rates.(11) The complete reorganisation of health and welfare services so as to puta brake upon the wastage of man-power due to ill-health.(12) Compulsory medical examination with training arrangements at fullwages pending employment as a skilled workman in another industry if with-drawn from the coalmining industry on medical grounds.The National Union of Mineworkers having in mind the man-power crisiswhich exists and recognising the complete dependence of our country&apos;s economyupon coal production, calls upon the Government through the Minister of fuel and Power to give guarantees that effect will be given to the foregoing measures in accordance with a time-table and a progressive plan.It is realised that whilst the man-power requirements of the industry will tend to fall as the industry is modernised, during the immediately ensuing years it will be necessary to depend upon the technical equipment now in existence.The only permanent source from which new man-power can be drawn andadequately trained is youths under 18 years of age. In the past the maintenanceof the industry&apos;s man-power by the continuous supply of youths to compensate for wastage has come mainly from the ranks of mineworkers&apos; sons. The miningcommunity, however, is not willing to accept a. special responsibility for thesupply of new mining labour. Quite rightly, miners and their wives have come to regard their sons as citizens entitled to seek a livelihood in more congenial, lessdangerous and better paid employment in the same way as do the sons of other people. Young persons will only be attracted to the coalmining industry insufficient numbers when it offers to them conditions of employment which compare favourably with those offered in other industries, and a higher standard of livingthan has been the lot of those who have toiled in the industry in the past.EBBY EDWARDS. Secretary.APPENDIX II.Dear Lawther, 11th March, 1946.You sent me on the 10th January a twelve-point &quot;Miners&apos; Charter&quot; ofreforms which in the view of your National Executive would require to bebrought into effect &apos;&apos; in accordance with a timetable and a progressive plan &apos;&apos; ifrecruitment to the industry is to be raised to a satisfactory level; and followingour meeting on the 21st February, in the course of which many points of detailwere clarified, I undertook to let you have a considered statement of my viewson the submissions made to me.I will first state my attitude to the Charter generally. On this I would saythat it is one of the principal objects of Government policy in nationalising the coalmining industry to achieve the kind of far-reaching reforms and improve-ments contained in the Charter. The objectives of the Coal Nationalisation Bill,as I stated them in introducing the Bill into Parliament, are (1) to reorganiseand modernise the coalmining industry so as to produce more efficiently the coalrequired to provide for full industrial activity and employment and the domesticneeds of the homes of the people, and (2) to provide all possible improvements inthe working conditions of the miners. These objectives could never have been attained under private ownership; we are agreed that they can only be achieved
3 &quot;   117under nationalisation. This is the first time, therefore, that the basic conditionsrequired for such fundamental industrial and social advances have been secured.The National Coal Board is being set up in order to achieve them and theGovernment confidently expects that it will do so.These objectives cannot, however, be dealt with separately. The coal whichthe nation will require for a full employment policy and for export can only besecured by the efforts of large numbers of miners. It is not only right butessential in order to secure the necessary man-power that the best possible con-ditions should be provided for men engaged in this vital national work. On theother hand, the best possible conditions can only be achieved as the industry isreorganised under nationalisation and as output is increased.Clearly it is only by consultations and collaboration between the national coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers that these twin objectivescan be brought to fruition. And there is no reason why such consultation and collaboration should wait till the vesting date. It can begin as soon as the Billbecomes an Act of Parliament and the National Coal Board is constituted, whichI expect wall be by June. Looking to the future collaboration in the industry which it is the object of the Coal Nationalisation Bill to promote, I am sure thatthis will be not only the most effective but the only really practicable way ofdealing with those aims of the Charter which are intimately related to produc-tion and costs.It has always been the Governments intention that consultation should takeplace between the National Coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers,and in order to make this intention abundantly plain a new clause is being included in the Bill laying upon the Board the statutory duty of entering into consultation with workers&apos; organisations with a view to the conclusion of voluntary agreements providing for (a) The establishment of comprehensive joint machinery of conciliation and agreed arbitration for the settlement of all issues arising between theBoard and persons engaged in the industry (i.e., issues involvingw-ages, hours, conditions, &amp;c)..(&amp;) the joint discussions of issues of mutual interest to the Board and personsin their employment (Le:, issues involving the safety, health and welfare of those engaged in the industry; the Board&apos;s development and operational policy; and, indeed, any issue of mutual interestarising out of the Board&apos;s functions as defined in Section 1 of theBill).What I contemplate is a Joint Industrial Council for the industry which wouldnot only have the duty of supervising the operation of comprehensive machineryof conciliation and arbitration to deal wdth issues which have been dealt withby similar joint machinery in the past, but which Would also be competent todiscuss all those matters arising out of the Board&apos;s policy in which organisedworkers have a legitimate interest.The Government are thus providing the basic machinery for securing theidnd of reforms embodied in the Miners&apos; Charter as soon as practicable, andas I have indicated I expect that consultations between the National Coal Boardand your Union can begin by June. As I have also indicated it is, in my view,only by such machinery that most of the reforms put forward in the Charter canbe effectively pursued and realised. There are, however, a number of items inthe Charter on which I can usefully comment in advance of such consultations,and I attach these comments as an annex to this letter.Yours sincerely,(Signed)      E. SHINWELL. &apos;Annex.The 5-day Week.I have, as you know, arranged for the implications of the establishment ofa 5-day week to be thoroughly examined by an expert Committee. When the analysis of the data collected by the Committee has been completed the full factswill be communicated to your Union.[31497] b 2
The modernisation of existing pits and the sinking of neiv ones as rapidly aspossible whilst strictly observing as a minimum the standards laid down inthe Reid Committee Report.This is the publicly declared policy of the Government. In my speech on theSecond Reading of the Bill I stated : &quot; Reorganisation of the industry, as was foreshadowed by the ReidReport, is the essence of this scheme . . . We contemplate a completemodernisation of the industry. Consequently, we propose to make advancesup to  150 million for the first five years, for the purpose of capital expendi-ture, and for the provision of working capital.&quot;The provision of adequate compensation for those who become redundant.The industry is at present suffering from a serious shortage of manpower,and it is far from certain that redundancy on any appreciable scale will arisefor many years to come. But assuming redundancy did arise, there is provision in the Nationalisation Bill which would enable the National Coal Board to providegratuities or some other form of compensation for redundant men. Any such provision would, of course, require to be considered in relation to the Governmentsfull employment policy and the available facilities for training and resettlement of transferred workers.The adequate and carefid training of youth in the various phases of miningoperations.I fully accept the need for adequate and careful training, especially on entryand in those cases where special technical knowledge is required. Steps havealready been taken in consultation with the National Union of Mineworkers tomake both statutory and other provision for this purpose, and further measures are being, and will continue to be, developed to secure progressive improvement.Mineworkers who prove their ability should have open to them every opportunity of fitting themselves for promotion to the highest posts and &quot; theestablishment of a clearly defined scheme of promotion &apos;&apos; will be a matter for theNational Coal Board to deal with in consultation with the workers&apos; organisation.The introduction of new safety laws to meet the conditions of modern mining and especially to sxippress the development of industrial diseases.The complete reorganisation of health and welfare services so as to put a brakeupon the ivastage of manpower due to ill-health.Continuous improvements in safety requirements and health services, andtheir adaptation to modern conditions of work, are an accepted and important part of Government policy.As I have already explained to you, it is my intention to introduce legislation to give effect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Safety in CoalMines as soon as Parliamentary time permits. In the meantime, an immediateprogramme of development by General Regulations and otherwise has beendiscussed and in large measure agreed with your Union.The payment of compensation rates to meet incapacity due to industrial injury or disease which shall guarantee the injured person from financial loss andthe provision of an adequate income for dependants of those killed as aresidt of injury or who die from an industrial disease.Compulsory medical examination with training arrangements at full wagespending employment as a. skilled workman in another industry ifwithdrawn from the coalmining industry on medical grounds.The Government^ policy in regard to compensation for industrial injury ordisease and for medically examining and training workmen who are no longer fit for work in the coalmining industry has been incorporated in the National jjInsurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill, which has now been passed through all its 1stages in the House of Commons.  The Bill itself does not make special provision \in these matters for particular industries, but Clause 82 provides for the joint!submission by employers and employed of supplementary schemes designed to gafford additional benefits or to cover cases other than those provided for in the IBill, and the question of preparing and submitting such a scheme for the coal- amining industry will be a matter between the National Coal Board and yourlUnion.  There is nothing in the Coal Industry Nationalisation Bill which would &apos;preclude the Board from adopting such a course.
The continuation of the prrinciple of the guaranteed weekly wage xvhen theEssential Work Order is withdrawn.I fully recognise the importance of this objective in relation to the miningindustry. At the appropriate time it will be for the National Coal Board andthe Unions concerned to negotiate an industrial agreement to take effect on thetermination of the Essential Work (Coalmining Industry) Order, 1943, whichwould meet this point; and you may rest assured that the Order will not beabruptly terminated in such a way as to create any obstacle to the maintenanceof the principle of the guaranteed wage.The provision of pensions for mineworkers who cease to follow their employment,after 55 years of age and the payment of subsidiary pension from theindustry in addition to pensions provided from other legal enactments.There is provision in the National Insurance Bill (Clause 27) enabling theMinister of National Insurance to approve supplementary schemes designed to afford additional benefits or to cover cases other than those provided for in theBill, and it will be competent for the National Coal Board in consultation with your Union to submit such a scheme for approval.The building of neio towns and villages of a high standard and situate at placescalculated to enable miners to have increased opportunities for socialfacilities and to break down the segregation of mineworkers and their families from the rest of the community, accompanied by the provision of adequate transport services at reasonable rates.The general principle involved is agreed and its development as circum-stances permit will be part of the nation&apos;s Housing Policy for which the Ministerof Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland are responsible.
