(46) 130.M April, 1946.CABINET.WAGES POLICY.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AT the meeting of the Cabinet on the 14th March (CM. (46) 24th Conclusions,Minute 6), I was invited to arrange for the Lord Presidents Committee toconsider at an early date the question of wages policy, and to submit their recommendations to the Cabinet.2. I accordingly arranged for the annexed report by the Official working party on Wages Policy to be considered by the Lord Presidents Committee at their meeting on the 29th March (L.P. (46) 11th Conclusions, Minute 3).3. x\s will be seen from the summary of conclusions in paragraph 29 of theirreport, the Official Working Party recommend no radical change in the establishedmachinery for the joint voluntary negotiation of wages by organisations ofemployers and workers and propose that a solution of the wages problems whichwill arise in the post-war conditions of full employment should be sought by givingthe fullest possible information to both sides of industry about our economic plans and the conditions essential to their fulfilment. For this purpose they suggestthat a new channel of communication between the Government and industry inthe form of a National Industrial Conference should be established.4. The Lord Presidents Committee generally endorsed the recommendationsof the Working Party and agreed that for the present reliance must be placed onthe education of employers and workers in their responsibilities on the lines proposed. The majority of the Committee felt, however, that as time went on itwould probably prove necessary for the Government to play a more positive partin shaping wages policy.5. In the discussion at the meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee thefollowing features of the problem were stressed : (a) to secure any necessary increases of wages in unattractive industries maybe a difficult task, where both employers and workers in these industries are badly organised:(b) wages should be related- to production and the aim should be to avoidwage increases in fully-manned industries merely designed to preservemargins which the workers in these industries have hitherto enjoyedover those in some of the under-manned industries;(c) it should be borne in mind that in full employment conditions the respon-sibilities of employers are fully as heavy as those of the workers(e.g., it is their duty to improve the physical conditions of work inthe unattractive industries);id) the Government may find it very difficult to avoid ultimate responsibilityfor the levels of wages in socialised industries;(e) further consideration would have to be given to the peculiar problemsof wages in agriculture and in local government employment.   TheWorking Party are preparing a further report on these problems.,   6.   The Lord Presidents Committee also raised a number of points onI the constitution of the proposed National Industrial Conference which I shouldPttng to the attention of the Cabinet (a) the National Industrial Conference should be a tripartite body withrepresentatives of the Government as well as of both sides of industry.The Government should be represented by Ministers, though not[31594] B0
always by the same Ministers. My own view is that there wouldbe advantage in having official as well as Ministerial representativesof the Government on the National Industrial Conference, and thatthere should be elasticity in Government representation;(b) the Minister of Labour suggested that his National Joint AdvisoryCouncil, which has a membership of about 50 and is the parent bodyof his Joint Consultative Committee, might be the appropriate body to be consulted about the establishment of the National industrial conference and indeed might form the basis of the National industrial conference. It would follow from this that the Federation of BritishIndustries would, at least initially, be excluded from the national industrial Conference. I am not entirely happy about the exclusion of the Federation of British Industries and I suggest that the cabinet should give this point careful consideration;(c) it will be necessary to consider how the interests of the employers insocialised industries are to be represented on the National industrial conference;(d) in establishing the National Industrial Conference we should be careful not to prejudice the position of the National Production AdvisoryCommittee&apos; for Industry, which advises the President of the Board ofTrade on production problems.7. In the light of the considerations set out in the annexed report by theWorking Party and in paragraphs 5 and 6 above, the Cabinet are asked- (i) to agree that the established machinery for voluntary negotiation ofwages by organisations of employers and workers.should continue, andthat for the purpose of acting as a channel of information between theGovernment and both sides of industry a National industrial conference should be established;(ii) to decide whether the National Industrial Conference should be on a tripartite basis, the Government being represented by Ministers and/orofficials as occasion may require, and whether it should include representatives of the Federation of British Industries;(iii) to authorise the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Labourand myself,* after consultation with other Ministers concerned, to approach the Trades Union Congress, the British Employers&apos;Confederation and, if it is decided to grant it representation, theFederation of British Industries, with a view to seeking their co-operation in the establishment of the National industrial conference;(iv) to agree that the proposed annual White Paper, which is to be the subjectof a submission to Ministers by the Steering Committee on economic development, should be the basis of discussions with the national industrial Conference, but should be suitably supplemented by other information to be made public or kept confidential as required, and,if necessary, by a White Paper specifically dealing with wages policy.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S. W. 1,3rd April, 1946.ANNEX.OFFICIAL WORKING PARTY ON WAGES POLICY.First Report.Introduction.AT their meeting on the 29th October, 1945, the Industrial Sub-Committeeof the Lord President^ Committee &quot; invited the Lord President of the Councilto arrange for an examination of the wage structure of industry to be undertaken with a view to framing proposals for a wages policy.&quot; Almost simultaneously anumber of related enquiries were set on foot through other channels into the* I assume that if the negotiations are still proceeding when the President of the Board ofTrade returns he should be associated with them. In the meantime I should of course representthe Board of Trades&apos; interests in view of any responsibility for the Department in his absence.
problems of re-direction of man-power, removal of labour controls, recruitment ofWorkers for under-manned industries, the organisation of a prosperity campaign,price stabilisation policy, and the general plan of economic development for 1946.These related investigations and projects have only now reached a suffiently advanced stage to enable tentative findings to be submitted to Ministers on thecentral problem of wages policy.2. Demand for a &apos;&apos; National Wages Policy &apos;&apos; has been publicly expressed invague and ambiguous terms, and some of the proposals which have been patforward appear to be open to strong objection, both in principle and in practice.The Working Party are, however, satisfied that there is a real and urgent need toexamine the relationship between the determination of wages by the collective bargaining system and the requirements of economic planning in conditions of full employment.3. We have considered this problem in broad terms, and in this FirstEeport we : (a) Outline briefly the existing constitutional machinery for wage settlements,which we recommend should continue to be developed in accordancewith established policy (paragraphs 5 to 9).(b) Review the tendencies in wage settlements which may conflict with national economic policy both during the immediate post-wartransition period and subsequently when more stable conditions maybe anticipated (paragraphs 10 to 17); and(c) Propose the establishment as a permanent link between the Governmentand the two sides in industry of a &quot; National Industrial Conference,&quot;which would be suitably informed and consulted on economic factors to be taken into account in wage settlements and would be the mainchannel for guidance to ensure that wages settlements should conform to the maximum practicable extent with current economic plans andwith the broad national interest (paragraphs 18 to 28).4. Throughout the Report, the word &quot; wages &quot; is used for the sake of con-venience as an abbreviation for terms and conditions of employment in the broadestsense, and is intended to cover salaries as well. The Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries has called our attention to certain particular problems of wages inagriculture, which we propose to consider separately.The Collective Bargaining System.5. The system of collective bargaining, by -which terms and conditions ofemployment are settled by means of voluntary collective agreement between employers and trade unions, has been supported for many years by employers anclworkers and by Governments. By 1914 most of the big staple industries werecovered by this machinery. During the war of 1914-1918 special war-timemeasures were introduced, but the membership of Trade Unions greatly increased and the extension of collective bargaining was maintained. In 1917 the WhitleyCommittee urged a continuance of the existing system whereby industries made their own agreements and settled their differences themselves, with resort where necessary (and by mutual agreement of both sides) to voluntary arbitration. Thispolicy was enacted in the Industrial Courts Act, 1919. In the inter-war period,voluntary collective bargaining was further developed with the approval of successive Governments ancl of industrial organisations. By 1939 the number ofwork-people covered by joint voluntary agreements was 10 million.6. When war broke out all experience went to show that costs and wages would rise. To restrain this tendency, steps were taken to hold prices; and whenthe cost of living was stabilized in 1941 a White Paper (Cmd. 6294) calling fora corresponding stability of wages was published. But the actual task of keeping-wages within reasonable limits was entrusted to industry itself. The soundnessQf this decision has been justified by the results. The need for stability in thewages structure in the post-war period was also foreseen and preparations weremade for it during the war by the active encouragement of joint machinery forthe negotiation of terms and conditions of employment. Parts I and II of theConditions of Employment ancl National Arbitration Order (special war-timeProvisions which for the time being remain in force) provided for compulsory arbitration, where appropriate, and for the prohibition of strikes and lock-outs,rhe development of voluntary machinery has, however, been continuous through-Qat the war and between 1940 and 1945 new joint Councils were established in[31594] b 2
45 industries, bringing the total number of such bodies up to 103, coveringindustries which in 1939 had 12^ million workers. The machinery for j0jnotnegotiation was specially strengthened by Part III of the Conditions of Employ,meat and National Arbitration Order, which gives statutory support to jointagreements between employers and Trade Unions, representing substantial numbers in the industries concerned. These provisions will be continued until1950 under the Third Schedule of the Wages Councils Act, 1945.7. There are several enactments which provide for the establishment of statutory Wages Boards or Councils with powers to make proposals to theMinister concerned for fixing minimum remuneration and holidays with pay.Such proposals when made effective by Statutory Order become legally enforce-able. The Wages Councils Act, 1945, re-enacted with slight modifications theTrades Boards Acts of 1909 and 1918, and converted the Trades Boards intoWciges Councils with somewhat wider powers. This Act also provides (subject in each case to recommendation by an independent Commission of Inquiry) forthe establishment of Wages Councils where there is no adequate voluntarymachinery for the regulation of wages and conditions, or where any such voluntarymachinery is likely to cease to exist or be adequate and a reasonable standard of remuneration will not be maintained. There are separate enactments providingfor the fixing of statutory minimum remuneration in the case of agriculture, road haulage and the catering industry. In 1939 the number of work-people coveredby statutory minimum wage legislation was 2\ million, and by 1945 this had risen to 3 million.8. The underlying object of the Government&apos;s approach to wages has been to safeguard industrial peace and maintain stability of the wages structure whilepreserving flexibility in the treatment of individual wages questions. Effect hasbeen given to this policy by :-(a) Entrusting  responsibility for  wage  regulation  to  the experiencedmachinery of joint voluntary negotiation.(b) Giving help by way of conciliation or voluntary arbitration in the eventof a dispute.(c) Continuing to stimulate and assist the setting up of machinery for voluntary negotiation and for the prevention and settlement of disputes.(d) Setting up statutory minimum wage fixing machinery where necessaryin the absence of effective machinery for joint voluntary negotiation.9. This process of wage adjustment by joint organisation exerts a powerfulinfluence upon the general harmony of industrial relations as well as a vitalstabilising influence upon the course of wage claims. This has been clearlydemonstrated by the remarkable smoothness* with which 2-\ million new peace-time jobs have been manned during the last nine months, despite the dislocationand sense of insecurity which such a vast turnover inevitably involves. Thisindustrial harmony is founded upon the full sense of responsibility which workers and employers&apos; organisations have acquired by long experience of free negotiation,which in turn is based upon the confidence of their members in the results (fortheir individual livelihoods) of this method of settling terms and conditions ofemployment.Wages in Full Employment Conditions.10. The economic environment in which this system developed so success-fully was very different from the high level of employment which it is government policy to maintain henceforth. Apart from the drastic set-backs of 1921, 1926and 1931, wage rates did rise markedly between the wars, although foreigncompetition limited these gains largely to sheltered industries, with effects stillprominent in the wage discrepancies and maldistribution of labour to-day. Butthe mass unemployment prevalent throughout this period exerted a powerfulrestraint upon upward pressure on wages. Their weakened bargaining positionmade workers more cautious in their claims, and expanding firms could draw onthe pool of unemployed without offering higher wages.* During the war 10-7   million   working   days were lost through industrial disputes,compared with 16-4 million in the shorter 1914-18 war; and in the six months followingyj-day 1-9 million days were lost, compared with 8-7 million in a corresponding periodsifter the 1918 Armistice.
11. Reduction of unemployment to a very low level has the following .effects :-(a) It encourages the worker to seek wage concessions, and compels the expanding trade to concede them in order to bid labour away fromother work.(b) The high all-round demand for goods associated with full employmentoffers sheltered industries an assured market, and relieves employersand employed of worries about adverse effects of wage and price increases.(c) In the absence of subsidisation or exchange rate adjustments, export industries and those exposed to import competition will resist wage claims, and must therefore tend to lose labour.(d) The priorities laid down by economic planning will only be realised ifwages can be raised rapidly enough in the &quot; under-manned &quot;industries to build, up their labour force as fast as target outputsrequire (since relative wages obviously cannot be adjusted by makingcuts elsewhere).(e) While there will be some automatic tendency for wages to go up in&quot;under-manned &quot; industries, the Trade Unions in &quot; fully-manned&quot;industries wall do their best to preserve their relative wage position by making sympathetic claims, which employers will resist only intrades subject to foreign competition. In future years, moreover, theGovernment and public authorities will together employ a quarter ofthe working population, mostly in the &quot;sheltered&quot; sector of the economy, and political pressure will tend to prevent their terms ofemployment from lagging behind the general level of wages.12. Left to themselves, these forces may well raise the general level of wagesfaster than increasing productivity expands the national product. In this case,prices will be forced up, causing dislocation and inequity throughout the economy,and putting a dangerous strain upon the balance of payments. And such changesin relative wages as do emerge will tend to reflect the extent to which various industries are sheltered and the bargaining strength of the different Trade Unions,rather than the requirements of the economic plan and the satisfaction of con-sumers&apos; demand.13. In principle, these effects could be avoided if restraint were exercisedupon wage claims in &apos;&apos; fully manned &apos;&apos; industries, in order to permit &apos;&apos; under-manned &apos;&apos; industries to attract extra labour by differential wage increases, without raising wages generally faster than physical output is expanding. But inpractice will Trade Unions exercise such restraint (in the appropriate places orthe right degree) simply because the price level will rise if they do not? Anyparticular group of workers can gain at the expense of the rest of the community,including other workers, even if the price of its own product does rise as a resultof the wage increase. And in any case the price of the product may not rise fully in step with the wage increase, in which case the workers as a whole may secure a bigger share of the national product, whether directly at the expense of profits,or of higher price subsidies financed by taxes falling largely on other income groups. The problem is rather to convince the Trade Unions that misplaced andexcessive wage claims will dislocate the economic plan and that there are other important methods of adjusting the distribution of the national product, suchas fiscal measures, or measures to prevent restrictive practices on the part of producers.Wages in the Transition.14. The huge back-log of demand and the physical scarcity of nearly all goods, inherited from the war, together with the consequent labour shortage,still further intensify the upward pressure on wages during the transition backto more normal conditions.* Moreover, peace-time priorities demand very bigtransfers of labour, largely in face of adverse wage differentials (deriving frmnwar demand for munitions and pre-war disparities between sheltered andunsheltered industries). At the same time, prices of the more essential goods are necessarily still held down by direct controls, and in some cases by subsidies * Wage rates in general have risen steadily throughout the war, and are now increasing at a rate offtbout 6 per cent, per annum; but reductions in overtime work and special bonuses must tendat Present to prevent the higher basic rates from being reflected in average hourly earnings.[31594] b 3
which, while preventing wage claims on subsistence grounds, yet encourage them,on other grounds by promising a real gain corresponding to money wage increasesparticularly where employers expect higher costs to be covered by extra subsidiesor cost-based price-fixing. While stabilisation subsidies form an important partof the policy of holding down prices in present turbulent conditions, they are a dangerous method of restraining wage demands in more normal conditions. Onthe one hand, pegging the cost-of-livihg actually encourages workers to believethat money gains will not be neutralised by reduced purchasing power, and theywill expect much of the taxation to finance the extra subsidies to fall on therest of the community. And, on the other hand, industries whose products aresubsidised inevitably become &quot;sheltered&quot; in the sense that the employers&apos;resistance to wage claims is weakened. But any reduction of stabilisationsubsidies would have to be gradual, ancl its timing will depend partly uponthe speed with which current shortages of food, textiles, &amp;c, can be overcome.15. Particular importance attaches to the trend of wages in export industries and those which compete with imports. In present conditions of acute shortageof goods abroad as at home, the immediate effect of increased costs might not much diminish our sales abroad. This position is, however, only temporary, and thereafter we shall be able to balance our accounts only if our costs are trulycompetitive. For this reason, the rise of wages in industries affecting the costof our exports should be kept to a minimum. But there is a real dilemma betweenthe need to maintain a competitive cost structure and an adequate labour forcein the export trades. It is clear that some export industries will remain seriously&quot;under-manned&quot; unless there is a substantial improvement in their terms ofemployment. Such changes in export costs, and others which may occur inde-pendently, will not put us at a competitive disadvantage if there are similarmovements of costs in other countries; but if we should find our prices and costs to be seriously out of line with those abroad, it might be necessary to contemplate some adjustment of the exchange rate.16. There is, however, little tendency for wage increases to be focussedparticularly upon the industries which need them most, because they are shortestof labour in relation to economic and social priorities such as cotton, agriculture,brickworks and iron foundries. Increases in these industries sufficient to attract the extra labour they require in present transitional conditions might not in themselves seriously inflate the national wage bill; but they would only achieve their objective if widespread sympathetic claims in &quot; fully-manned &quot; industriescould be avoided.Summary of Economic Objectives.17. In brief, the changed conditions of the post-war economy make itparticularly important that as much restraint as possible should be exercised uponwage increases in the &quot; fully-manned &quot; industries, for the following reasons : (a) In order to allow increased wage rates in the badly &quot; under-manned &quot;industries to have full effect in making such industries more attractive to labour;(&amp;) In order to prevent a generally active demand for labour from causing an upward movement in the level of wage rates out of relation to increases in the general level of productivity, thus leading to a general inflationof money prices and costs, with seriously adverse effects upon our foreign trade position; and(c) In order to avoid increases in labour costs in the &quot;fully-manned&quot;industries which might lead to localised unemployment.A National Wages Policy.18. In the light of these considerations, the Working Party are agreed thatthe adoption of planning and full employment policies necessitates a full and frank examination and definition of the relationship between the establishedmachinery for wage adjustment in industry and the economic objectives and machinery of Government; and that the special problems of the transitional period make this task the more urgent.19. Direct fixing of wages by the State is out of the question. Quite apartfrom its extreme administrative difficulties, such a step would destroy the whoto
fabric of harmonious industrial relations, the Government would become thefocus for workers&apos; claims and strike action, and every major wage issue wouldbe subject to strong political pressure and dangerous sectional passions.20. Nor would it be possible to evolve a successful hybrid system of com-pulsory limits imposed by the Government within which collective bargainingvrould be free to operate. Such a system would require some such method asthe compulsory reference to arbitration of certain types of wage questions, whichwould have to be defined. The arbitration tribunal would presumably be subjectto some form of inspiration from the Government of the day, and able to directffao-e movements accordingly. In the past, arbitration has been confined to caseswhere there is failure by two parties to agree. Some way would have to befound to prohibit any wage change even where both parties were willing tomake it, and to require them to submit their proposals to an outside body forapproval. If approval was not given there would presumably be a penalty onemployers for making an increase or a reduction, and presumably on workers for accepting it. Any attempt to force these decisions on unwilling parties would inevitably lead to unrest and disaffection. The system would not preventstrikes it would substitute - the Government for the employer as one of thecontesting parties.21. During the war the National Arbitration Tribunal has dealt with alarge number of important and difficult issues and its awards were everywheretreated with respect. The Tribunal could not, however, prevent or directlyinfluence wage adjustment made between the parties. There is no assurance that even this limited form of compulsory arbitration will be continued for any length of time. Experience since the war has shown that it will not be accepted for the settlement of major issues involving the peace-time set up of the industry.The major problem however, if the State were to assume responsibility, is how to preserve the authority of employers&apos; organisations and trade unions when matters which are of greatest concern to their members are taken out of their hands. The trade unions are essentially democratic bodies and if they lose their authority to act for their members on the most fundamental questions the pressure from the rank and file will inevitably seek other outlets.22. There can be no compromise between a democratic and an authoritariansystem, and the practical problem must be cast in terms of how our industrial democracy can be persuaded to understand and accept the new responsibilitiesimposed upon it by the very different conditions of full employment. A fullermeasure of self-discipline on the part of both workers and employers is theprice which must be paid if everybody i? to have a job and industry is to beconsistently prosperous. Education will not eliminate the sectional considera-tions which underlie the determination of the earnings of labour, nor will itmake collective bargaining a perfect or tidy instrument of economic policy.But given the right leadership, there is good cause to expect that a real andvigorous industrial democracy can be combined with the essential requirementsof a full employment era.23. The Working Party are agreed that the constitutional machinery for joint wage negotiation by organisations of employers and employed remains of fundamental value and should continue to be developed in accordance withestablished policy. Nevertheless, against a background of full employment theoperation of the present system is open to the following criticisms :  (a) When negotiating wages it is difficult for organisations of employers orworkers in one section of industry to see beyond their immediateinterests, or to appreciate the significance of their decisions in relationto the general economic background.(b) The system does not at present provide adequate means of adjustingrelative levels of wages according to national needs.(c) Left to themselves, wages in general will tend to rise faster than output,which will push prices up and unbalance foreign trade.These defects are closely bound up with the human factor in industrial relations, and any approach to the problem must be directed to the promotion ofconfidence in the policy of full employment and knowledge of what it implies.
There must be a channel of communication to keep the individual employer andworker informed about Government plans and the economic position of thecountry.24. We therefore suggest that the principal remedies for the deficiencieswhich have given rise to a demand for a national wages policy are to be found(a) In creating confidence in a full employment policy, and in developing an appreciation of the responsibility of Trade Unions and of employers&apos;organisations in conditions of full employment;(6) In promoting a better understanding by employers and workers and theirrepresentatives of the relation of wage demands to national policy andof the limits within which such demands can appropriately be pressed-(c) In meeting the demands (illustrated at recent meetings with employersand Trade Unions) for more information on the Governmentseconomic plans and on economic prospects; and(d) In developing regular constitutional channels of consultation betweenthe Government and employers&apos; organisations and Trade Unions onproblems affecting the use of labour in connection with economic planning.An Approach to Industry.25. It is suggested that these needs might be met by making availableregular economic information to industry and by establishing a constitutionalchannel for consultation with industry on the implications of this information.At the recent conference of Ministers with employers, a demand was voiced for a white Paper to be issued giving basic information on man-power and otheiaspects of economic planning. We understand that the Steering Committee onEconomic Development will shortly be submitting to Ministers proposals for theissue of an annual White Paper setting forth tlie essential points of the Govern-menfs economic plans for the year in question. Such an annual White Paper, ifissued, would provide the statistical framework of Government policy to be taken as a basis for constructive formulation of policy by Trade Unions and employers&apos;organisations on labour matters. It might also be desirable for the Governmentto issue, as in 1941, a White Paper specifically dealing with wages policy, andconveying any additional information necessary for that purpose. Theissue of these White Papers, however, would not in itself meet the need for consultation and discussion between Government and industry on the background of economic policy, nor would it serve the purpose of placing on industry any increased responsibility in negotiating wages in circumstances which call forrestraint, if the results are to be compatible with the sound functioning of national economy^. Joint consultation between the Government, employers&apos; organisations and Trade Unions has been firmly established during the war and it should bepossible to build on this foundation.26. It is, therefore, recommended that Ministers should discuss the problem with employers&apos; organisations and Trade Unions, with a view to securing their agreement upon the following course of action : (a) On the basis of the White Papers referred to in the previous paragraph,consultation would take place with both sides of industry on the meansof achieving by concerted action the targets desired to be attained.(6) There should be constituted a standing &apos;&apos; National Industrial Conference &quot;which should be either :  (i) a tripartite body on which the Government, the employers&apos;organisations and the Trade Unions would be represented; or(ii) a body representing employers and employed only, which Govern-ment  Departments  would  provide  with   information  and guidance.We suggest that employers and Trade Unions should be invited toexpress a view whether the proposed conference should be bilateralor tripartite, and that if they are firmly of the opinion that a bilateralpattern will succeed this should be preferred. If, however, they arenot of this view, the alternative of setting up the Conference on government initiative and with Government participation should be pursued.
(c) Whatever precise constitution of the Conference is agreed, the working party consider that : &apos;(i) In addition to the White Papers referred to at (a) above, theGovernment should undertake to supply the Conference with information, where necessary confidential, outlining theeconomic conditions and trends as seen by the Government atthe time.(ii) It would be the duty of the Conference to examine the materialmade available and to give their considered views for the guidance of industry on the common policy to be followed by employers&apos; organisations and Trade Unions in the national interest.(iii) The Conference should be encouraged to promote the general understanding by workers ancl employers of the basic economic considerations operative in conditions of full employment.(iv) The Conference might also be asked from time to time to con-sider specific questions, e.g., the relative wage levels indifferent industries and the problem of attracting labour to industries of national importance. They might also be encouraged to prepare and publish periodically general state-ments on factors affecting productivity and wages.27. The value of a &quot;National Industrial Conference&quot; will depend uponbuilding up their authority with industry as a whole, especially if they are todeal with such delicate questions as the responsibilities of workers in conditionsof full employment and the restraints which should be exercised by employers in&quot;fully-manned &quot; industries in bidding for labour in conditions of labour shortage.It will be essential for the Conference to have the full support of the Trade Unionsancl employers&apos; organisations and for the Government to take them fully intoconfidence.28. The Working Party consider that the favourable atmosphere created by the successful launching of the prosperity campaign should be turned to account, and that the proposals outlined above should be discussed with theTrades Union Congress and the British Employers&apos; Confederation, and perhapsalso Avith the Federation of British Industries at a later stage. It is moreimportant to set up a machinery which will command the maximum confidence of both sides of industry than to impose any particular preconceived pattern,provided the objective of a satisfactory bridge between the economic machineryof Government and industry is secured. If the right mechanism and the rightatmosphere can be created, it should be possible, in stages, to secure frankdiscussion of the implications of a full employment policy and to give guidance to industry which may have far-reaching consequences.Gonchisions and Recommendations.29. (a) The Government should continue to reject any proposals for fixingwages by the State, or any extension of the system of compulsory arbitration.(b) The established  constitutional  machinery  for  the  joint  voluntarynegotiation of wages by organisations of employers and employedshould continue to be developed in accordance with existing policy.(c) Nevertheless, in the post-war conditions of full employment it will be particularly important that great restraint should be exercised in wage increases in &quot; fully-manned &quot; industries.(d) A new constitutional channel,  provisionally called the &quot; national industrial Conference,&quot; should be created for the purpose of inform-ing both sides in industry regarding economic plans and policies,and the conditions essential to their successful fulfilment against a background of full employment. (It will be for consideration, afterconsultation with representatives of workers and employers, whetheror not the Government should participate in, or should merely promote and assist such a body.)(e) Ministers should approach the organisations representative of employersand employed, and seek their co-operation on the establishment of the&quot; National Industrial Conference.&quot; In the light of these discussions and of instructions from Ministers, details could be worked out by theWorking Party.
(/) The proposed annual White Paper, which is to be the subject of asubmission to Ministers by the Steering Committee on economic development, should be the basis of discussions with the &apos;&apos; national industrial Conference,&quot; but should be suitably supplemented by other information to be made public or kept confidential as required, andif necessary, by a White Paper specifically dealing with wages policy(see para. 25).Signed on behalf of the Working PartyE.
