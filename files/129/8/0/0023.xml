SECRET. Copy No.   3CP. (46) 123.md March, 1946.CABINET.SELECT COMMITTEE ON MEMBERS&apos; EXPENSES.-Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I attach the Committee&apos;s report. It is, I think, desirable that the cabinet should, without delay, decide on what action should be taken on these recommenda-tions and should announce its decision.2. I propose that we should accept the recommendations. They areunanimous and, in my opinion, reasonable in all the circumstances of the case.3.   Taking the recommendations separately (a) The increase of Members&apos; salaries to  1,000 a year can be authorised bya Resolution of the House. No legislation is necessary and a TreasuryOrder can be made to increase the expense allowance, free of incometax, to  500.   Its cost to the Exchequer would be  228,000 a year.(6) The proposal that Ministers with salaries of less than  5,000 a year, (theCabinet decided to exclude from the consideration of the SelectCommittee the position of Ministers with salaries of  5,000 a year ormore), and also the Chairman and Beputy-Chairman of Ways and means, should have an expense allowance of  500 a year free of incometax in their capacity as Members of the House, in addition to theirpresent salaries, is, in my view, reasonable. It would have the effect,which I think is desirable, of narrowing the wide gap which nowseparates the salaries of Ministers with  5,000 a year or more fromthe rest of the Ministerial team. In particular, it would remove aserious financial grievance under which the Whips are now suffering.Some of these are worse off, as a result of accepting office, than theywould be as private Members. The cost to the Exchequer would be 22,500.To give effect to this recommendation legislation would benecessary, since the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, provides(Section 6, Sub-Section 2) that no person in receipt of salary under that Act shall be entitled to receive any sum by way of salary orallowance in respect of his Membership of the House. I propose thata Bill be drafted to amend the Ministers of the Crown Act, and anyother material legislation, in this respect, and that we should pass it into law as soon as possible.(c) I see no objection to accepting this recommendation, that the salaries of the persons affected by (b) should be reviewed without commitment.But, particularly if we give effect to the recommendation under (b), Ido not regard this as an urgent matter.(d) This can be dealt with administratively.    I daresay that a moderateincrease in these allowances is reasonable, and I should like to beauthorised to look into it and settle it.(e) This is a sensible recommendation, to which I know that many of theM.Ps. concerned attach importance on grounds of practicalconvenience.  It would not require legislation.[31523]Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1946.
(/) I have no objection to this recommendation, provided it is clear that theCommittee is only advisory to Mr. Speaker, who would not necessarily be bound by its advice, and that any disputed question of importancewould, in fact, be settled between Mr. Speaker and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.(g) I welcome this recommendation, which frees us from the prospect of manyadministrative complications.4. These recommendations have had a very good reception from the press and, I gather, from Members in all parts of the House. I understand that theTories would support them officially. I suggest that soundings should be taken tomake sure of this. I do not anticipate that the adoption of these recommendations would lead to any serious criticism in the country, and, such as there was, would,I think, be quite shortdived.5.   I ask my colleagues to agree to the action proposed in paragraph 3 above.H. D.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,22nd March, 1946.

144The Select Committee appointed to consider the expenses incurred in con-nection with their parliamentary and official duties by Members of this House,including Ministers whose salary is less than  5,000 per annum, their remunera-tion and their conditions of work , have agreed to the following Report : 1. Your Committee held 13 meetings and examined 26 witnesses. Inaccordance with the precedent of the Select Committee on Members&apos; Expensesappointed in the Session of 1920, a circular letter from the Chairman was addressed to all Members of the House, quoting the terms of reference and asking whether there were any points on the incidence of their expenses as members which they wished to bring to notice. Your Committee are grateful for the memoranda and the numerous replies received from Members which enabled them to gauge the limits of their inquiry and materially helped themto decide the course of their proceedings. At the Chairman&apos;s invitation thefouowing Members of the House attended to give evidence : the Rt. Hon.William Whiteley, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, and Captainthe Rt. Hon. James Stuart, M.V.O., M.C., Chief Opposition Whip, on ministerial salaries ; Mr. Glenvil Hall, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, onthe position of the Treasury in the interpretation of Resolutions of the Houseaffecting payments to Members ; Mr. George Hicks, Mr. Rogers and Mrs.Corbet, Mr. Martin Lindsay and Mr. John Maude, Captain Geoffrey Bing, Mr.Viant and Mr. Binns, on memoranda submitted on behalf of groups of Members ;Mr. Quintin Hogg on his memorandum ; Mr. Robert Boothby, Mr. W. J.Brown, Sir William Darling, C.B.E., M.C., Mr. A. E. Davies, Mr. Duthie, Mr.Gammans, Viscount Hinchingbrooke, Mr. Asterley Jones and Sir Basil Neven-Spence, on expenses in general. In addition, Sir Gilbert Campion, K.C.B., the clerk of the House, and Mr. A. J. Moyes, O.B.E., the Accountant, gave evidence on points of procedure and administration ; and Sir Cornelius Gregg, K.C.B.,K.B.E., Chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, and Mr. R. A. Little,Director of Postal Services and Mr. P. R. Mellors, the General Post Office, on matters affecting their Departments. The Dominions Office furnished informa-tion on the emoluments granted to Members of the Central Legislatures of theDominions, for which Your Committee are grateful and which they have noted with interest. Your Committee have added as appendices to theirReport the Chairman&apos;s circular letter to Members of the House, the information on the emoluments of Members of the Central Legislatures of the Dominions,a short Historical Retrospect of the changes since 1911 in the payments and concessions for travel to Members of the House, and statistical information furnished by the Board of Inland Revenue on the incidence of claims torexpenses by Members.PRESENT situation. At present the payment to Members is at the rate of  600 a year. Ofthis, by a Treasury Minute of 1913,  100 free of income tax is allowed for expenses, but a Member, if he can show that his expenses exceed this figure,can claim expenses up to the full amount of the  600 under ordinary incometax procedure. There is also nothing to prevent the Treasury raising thefigure of  100 up to the full amount of  600, if it were thought fit. Membersnow also receive the concession of free first-class travel by rail for the journeysbetween Westminster and their constituencies, between Westminster andtheir homes and between their homes and their constituencies. The cost off first-class sleeping berths and of the charge for travel by an all-Pullmantrain are allowed. Travel by air is allowed from convenient aerodromes49268 a 2
to cover the same three classes of journeys as for rail.    The war-time ,concessions for Members serving in the Forces for free travel from their warstations to Westminster and to the constituency are still in forceCONSIDERATION OF THE EVIDENCE3. Practically all the evidence and the written replies agreed in recom-mending some material increase in the present remuneration of Members.Some were in favour simply of an increased annual payment, some only claimedan increased allowance for expenses or additional free services, and others were for combining these two methods in varying degrees. In general, however,Your Committee find that the claims for an improvement in existing conditionsresolve themselves into two main categories, (a) for financial measures calculated to provide any Member, after the deduction of legitimate expenses, with asum that will enable him to carry out his duties efficiently and withoutembarrassment, and (b) for extensions of free travel (including allowances forcars) and for free postage, for free telephone calls, and for additional accommodation.4. Expenses. From the evidence presented, and from their own experience,Your Committee are in no doubt that expenses incurred by Members in thecourse of their parliamentary duties, both at Westminster and in their constituencies, are at present very high and that, in consequence, many members are finding themselves in a position in which they cannot performthose duties without financial anxiety. These expenses fall under four heads :the additional cost of living away from home when engaged in parliamentary duties at Westminster; the additional cost of living when engaged in parliamentary duties in the constituency when the Member does not livethere ; the cost of secretarial and clerical assistance ; and the cost of suchitems as stationery, postage, telegrams and telephone calls. The incidence ofthese expenses varies in the case of each Member according to the geographicalsituation of his constituency and of his residence, the amount of his corres-pondence and his individual methods of work. It is not surprising, therefore,to find that the sum claimed to cover these expenses varies within the widelimits of the figures given in the table furnished by the Inland Revenue, from 100 to  600.   (See Appendix IV).Members coming from a distance who have to engage accommodation inLondon may find that they will have to spend  200 or more a year for expenses in London, while attending at Westminster. Members resident in London, onthe other hand, do not incur this expense, but are faced with the continualhigh cost of living in London. The expenses incurred for work in a* con-stituency depend upon its nature, whether urban or rural, its extent and the size of the electorate, and it is impossible to give an average figure.Witnesses were of the opinion which is borne out by the experience of theMembers of Your Committee that a Member must have a personal secretary,even though he does not employ one full time. His work is individual, and cannot suitably be done in a typists&apos; pool. The salary of the type of secretary-required is now about  5 to  6 a week, so that a Member must expect to paysome  150 to  200 for part time services. It is again difficult to assess the costof stationery, postage, telegrams and telephone calls. This may vary from 25 to  100 per annum, though some Members have found that it is higher.There is no doubt that, at the present moment, the number of personal problemsupon which constituents seek help from their Members is very large. Thiswas the case at the end of the 1914-18 war and is, it may be hoped, a passingphase. On these grounds, arguments were adduced for the grant to Membersof free postage, telegrams and toll or trunk telephone calls.
-    145The difficulties of finding hotel or other living accommodation in London*at the present moment have led to suggestions that living accommodationshould be provided near the House for Members who require it. your committee see many administrative objections to such a scheme, and are ofthe opinion that it is not desirable to herd Members into anything of the natureof a Members&apos; Hostel.   They do not consider that the idea should be pursued.Your Committee were happy to find that the provision of a set luncheonat is. 6d. and dinner at 2s. in the Members&apos; Dining Room was welcomed byMembers as a relief of their daily expenses in London. This and the otheramenities provided in the House, such as the smoking and reading roomsand the library, with its valuable collection of books of reference, were borne in mind by Your Committee in coming to their conclusions. In this connection,Your Committee note that a room has been arranged in the House for theuse of Members&apos; secretaries, and some rooms made available in No. 5, OldPalace Yard, where Members may transact business. The plans for the newChamber include twenty-one secretarial rooms, two conference rooms and teninterviewing rooms for Members* and, when the rebuilding is complete,Members should no longer have grounds for complaint in this respect.5. Travel. The extension of free travel for Members to include journeysbetween Westminster and their place of residence was made last November.Those Members, not a few, who live in or near London and make this journeysdaily, have naturally availed themselves of the concession. A voucher hasto be made out for every journey, and the great increase in the number ofvouchers has resulted in a corresponding increase of paper work in the TravelOffice in the House of Commons, in the railway clearing house and the FeesOffice, where the vouchers are finally checked. While this system of vouchersis working smoothly for Members who live some distance from London and donot travel every day, Members living on the system of the London passenger transport Board find it particularly irksome to present a voucher daily at their local booking office, and also complain that vouchers do not cover travel bythe other services provided by the Board.Wider suggestions were put before Your Committee to extend free travelby rail or sea for Members to cover the whole of Great Britain andNorthern Ireland. It was argued that Members have to deal with matters affecting the whole country and should not be prevented from studyingconditions for themselves by the cost of the journey. Your Committee do not feel that a strong case was made out for such an extension at the present time.A still more ambitious suggestion was that Members should be granted free travel to the Colonies and the Dependencies for reviewing the administrationof which the House has direct responsibility. While appreciating the highvalue of such visits by Members, either as individuals or in a parliamentary-delegation, Your Committee are of the opinion that this proposal is outside their terms of reference and can be considered in the first place only by theHouse itself.Under the same heading comes a proposal to grant an allowance for theuse of a motor car on journeys for which free travel by rail is now given, eitheragainst the fare for the corresponding journey by rail or on a mileage basis.It is undoubtedly a convenience for Members to have their cars at the House&apos;so that they can go home after a late sitting, or to make the journey either from London or theii place of residence to the constituency by road, in orderto have the car available for work there, but Your Committee considered   thatsuch use: of a car is a convenience rather than a necessity, and that the cost should be met out of a Member&apos;s allowance for expenses.* See the Report from the Select Committee on House of Commons (Rebuilding^(H.C. log, Session 1943-44).49268 A 3
CONCLUSIONSRemuneration of Members and concessions for travel6. After considering the evidence and in framing their recommendations,Your Committee agreed upon three principles which they hope will commendthemselves to the House and to the country: that a Member should be allowedhis reasonable expenses, wholly, necessarily and exclusively incurred in the performance of his duties as a Member; that he should then receive a sumwhich will enable him to maintain himself comfortably and honourably, butnot luxuriously, during the time he is a Member of the House ; and that themethods for dealing with expenses and with travelling concessions should besimple to administer.7. So far as remuneration is concerned, Your Committee consider that these principles can be best applied by recommending the payment to a Member ofa fixed annual sum, to include a sum free of tax to cover all reasonable expenses,but one larger than the sum of  100 at present so allowed. The figures furnished by the Board of Inland Revenue* show that 369 out of 534 Members areestimating their expenses at over  450, and, of these, 309 at over  500 for thecurrent financial year. These figures indicate that the sum which should beallowed for expenses lies between  450 and  600. It is impossible to arriveat any figure without appearing to give some too much and others too little.Your Committee are of the opinion that  500 is the fair sum that should beallowed to all Members for expenses instead of the  100 as at present. members would then have to claim relief from income tax only for expenses above  500.In assessing the sum which should be paid to a Member in addition to hisexpenses, Your Committee have not regarded it as a professional salary.Though a Member may. be called upon to devote a great deal of time to thebusiness of the House, he has complete freedom to allot his time between his parliamentary duties, either at Westminster or in his constituency, and his personal affairs. It would be most unwise to take this freedom from him bypaying such a figure as would unequivocally demand his full time in return.The sum must, however, suffice to enable him &quot; to maintain himself com-fortably and honourably, but not luxuriously &quot; while a Member of the House.These are the words used by the late Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor when he introduced payment of Members in 1911, and Your Committee feel that they still express the wishes of the House. Your Committee are agreed that this sum should be  500.Your Committee therefore recommend that the salaries of Members shouldbe increased to  1,000 a year, of which  500 should be allowed to all member as an expense allowance free of income tax.8. In view of this recommendation, Your Committee do not consider thatany general extension of free rail and air travel or for the grant of car allowance for Members is necessary. They agree, however, that Members who live in or near London and come up daily to Westminster while the House is sittingshould be relieved of the burden of presenting vouchers for the tickets. they therefore recommend that arrangements should be made without delay withthe railway companies concerned and the London Passenger Transport Board,for the issue of season tickets of suitable duration to Members who wish tohave them for daily journeys on which they are entitled to free travel.9. For the same reason, Your Committee do not recommend that freepostage, free telegrams and free telephone calls should be granted to Members.They inquired into the possibilities of the issue of franked envelopes, or of* See Appendix IV.
-    146postage stamps to a certain value, but found that any such system, even ifrestricted to correspondence posted in the House itself, would be complicatedto administer and would not be satisfactory. Members now have free telephonefacilities for the London area from the telephone boxes in the House, and your Committee found that an extension to include toll and trunk calls was neither practicable nor desirable.10. When Members travel on the business of the House, as, for instance,when they make visits of inspection as Members of a Select Committee, they receive subsistence allowance at the rate of 23s. 6d. a night. The rate was fixed in agreement with the Treasury and corresponds to that allowed to senior officers of the Fighting Services and of the Civil Service. Members with experience of such visits have found that their expenses are seldom coveredby the allowance. Your Committee are fully satisfied that there is a strong case for an immediate review of the rate and are agreed that it is not sufficientlyhigh. They therefore recommend that the rate of subsistence allowance beincreased.Ministerial Salariesii. By their terms of reference Your Committee were instructed to inquire into the salaries and expenses of Ministers with salaries under  5,000 a year.Ministers who draw the salary attached to their office cease to draw their salaries as Members of the House, and are thus precluded from claimingexpenses as Members. In the knowledge of Your Committee some junior ministers have found it more advantageous to forgo their ministerial salaryand to retain their salaries as Members. All have found that they have undertaken heavy responsibilities to the House and to their Departmentswithout a commensurate increase in actual emoluments and, in some cases,with a considerable reduction in their personal income. Your committee consider that some relief should be given in the way of expenses, and that the simplest method would be for Ministers with salaries under  5,000 a yearto continue to draw  500 a year for expenses as Members of the House inaddition to their salary. This would require legislation to amend the ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, and other material Acts. The Chairman of Ways and means and the Deputy Chairman should also receive this allowance in additionto their salaries.Your Committee therefore recommend that Ministers with salaries of lessthan  5,000 a year, the Chairman of Ways and Means and the Deputy Chairmanshould be granted an expense allowance at the rate of  500 a year free of incometax as Members of the House in addition to their present salaries ; and thatthe legislation necessary to amend the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, andother material Acts should be introduced. They further recommend that the salaries of these Ministers and of the Chairman of Ways and Means and of the deputy Chairman should be reviewed by the Government.Committee to advise Mr. Speaker12. From the evidence given by the Financial Secretary to the treasury and by the Clerk of the House, Your Committee find that the position of theTreasury in the interpretation of Resolutions of the House affecting payments and concessions for free travel to Members is indeterminate. If a Memberis in dispute with the Treasury on any such points, or if the Treasury decline to give a ruling, the final decision rests with Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker maythus be called on to give his ruling in small matters, the details of which wouldbe, in the opinion of Your Committee, beneath the dignity of his office.Further, it would not be decorous for a Member, if he felt dissatisfied, to challenge Mr. Speakers ruling in the House. Your Committee consider thatit would assist Mr. Speaker if a small informal committee, nominated by him
sin the same way as is the Library Committee, were set up to advise him on suchmatters, whose recommendations would be accepted both by the treasury and by the Member concerned. They therefore recommend that consideration should be given to setting up a small informal committee, nominated byMr. Speaker, to assist him in matters affecting the payments and concessionsfor free travel to Members, the recommendations of which would be acceptedby Members and by the Treasury.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS13. Your Committee&apos;s recommendations and conclusions can be summarisedas follows : (a) The salaries of Members should be increased to  1,000 a year, ofwhich  500 should be allowed to all Members as an expense allowancefree of income tax (paragraph 7).(b) Ministers with salaries of less than  5,000 a year, the Chairman of ways and Means and the Deputy Chairman should be granted an expense allowance at the rate of  500 a year free of income tax as members of the House in addition to their present salaries ; andthe legislation necessary to amend the Ministers of the Crown Act,1937, and other material Acts should be introduced (paragraph 11).(c) The salaries of these Ministers and of the Chairman of Ways and means and of the Deputy Chairman should be reviewed by theGovernment (paiagraph 11).(d) The rate of subsistence allowance granted to Members when travellingon the business of the House should be increased (paragraph 10).(*?) Arrangements should be made without delay with the railway com-panies concerned and the London Passenger Transport Board for theissue of season tickets of suitable duration to Members living in or near London, who wish to have them for daily journeys for whichthey are entitled to free travel (paragraph 8).(f) Consideration should be given to setting up a small committee,nominated by Mr. Speaker, to assist him in matters affecting the pay-ments and concessions for free travel to Members, the recommend-dations of which would be accepted by Members and by theTreasury (paragraph 12).(g) In view of th^ir recommendation in (a) above, Your committee consider unnecessarj^ any extension 01 free travel (paragraph 9), any allowance for the use of a motor car (paragraph 8), or the grant of freepostage, telegrams and telephone calls (paragraph 9).

APPENDIX IIIHistorical RetrospectChanges in the payments to Members and concessions for travelsince 19111. Payment to Members, at the rate of  400 a year, was first introduced in the session of 1911 by a Resolution of the House of 10th August, and a supplementary estimate to defray the cost was passed on 14th August. Since that year the requisite amount has appeared in the Annual Estimates, and the Vote of theAmount is the Paymaster General&apos;s authority for issue. By Section 3 of theFinance Act, 1913, the Treasury was empowered to fix an annual average summ SOUTH AFRICA 149AllowanceSenate :  Members,  700 per annum.House of Assembly : Members,  700 per annum.Members of both Houses are also at present in receipt of a cost of living allowance of  84 per annum.A deduction of  6 is made for each day of absence from a meeting of the House,except where the absence is due to attendance at a Select Committee ; to illness ;to summons or subpoena of a competent Court (unless the summons is on a criminalcharge upon which the Member is convicted) ; to the death or serious illness of his wife and the absence is condoned by the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders ;to service with Forces while the Union is at war ; in respect of a further period notexceeding 25 days during a Session at which estimates of expenditure of the financialyear are considered.TravelA Member is entitled to a free pass over lines controlled by the South African Rail-ways. He is allowed to rail his motor car to Cape Town and return once during a Session.Air Travel was suspended early in the war.For concessions to families see Note 3 below.Residence in CapitalThere is no allowance for the cost of residence in the Capital.Expenses in ConstituencyThere is no allowance for expenses in the constituency.Secretarial expensesOne shorthand typist, paid from the Vote of the Clerk of the Senate, is the onlyclerical assistance for all Senators.For Members of the House of Assembly, expenditure is reimbursed at a rate fixed by the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders and allotted to the political parties in proportion to their membership. During Sessions franked envelopes are providedfor Members&apos; correspondence on Parliamentary and public business. A Memberis allowed free local telephone calls, and one trunk call of six minutes (or two ofthree minutes) once a week home or to a place in his constituency.Note 3Members of his household residing with and dependent upon him are entitled to freetransport by rail from place of residence to seat of Legislature and return once in respectof every Session. A Member&apos;s wife is normally entitled to a second return journey by rail during a Session between a Member&apos;s place of residence and Cape Town.
for expenses incurred by Members in the performance of their parliamentary duties which would be free of income tax, and, by a Minute of 23rd October, 1913!fixed this sum at  100, a sum which had in fact been allowed in the previous year.2. In the Session of 1920, a Select Committee was appointed to consider the salary allotted to Members of the House, the travelling and other expenses incurred by them in connection with their Parliamentary duties. This Committee refrained from making a specific recommendation for an increase of salary though satisfiedthat the matter should be given further consideration, but recommended thatfree first class travel between the London terminus and a Member&apos;s constituencyshould be granted, and that facilities for free postage of Members&apos; letters shouldbe provided. The House never approved the recommendation for free postage,and, as will be seen below, did not approve the travelling concession until 1924.3. During the financial stringency of 1931, the payment to Members was reducedto ^360 a year from 1st October 1931 ; it was raised again to ^380 from 1st July1934, and to the full ^400 from 1st July 1935.4. On 1st July 1937 payment to Members was increased %to  600. In movingthe increase, the Prime Minister, the late Mr. Neville Chamberlain, asked the house to take into consideration the difficulties in which many Members found themselves,and pointed out that not only had there been a fifty per cent, rise in the cost ofliving, but that demands on Members had risen due to the extension of the electorateand the increase of Parliamentary business.5. The House did not approve the Estimate in 1921 which allowed for the costof the travelling concessions recommended by the Select Committee of 1920, andit was not until 1924 that free 1st class travel between London and a station withinthe constituency was granted to Members. In 1926, this concession was extendedto cover a convenient station short of the constituency. In 1931, during thefinancial stringency, the railway vouchers were made available for 3rd class fares.In 1932, a Member was allowed the cost of a 3rd class sleeping berth, providedthat the cost of the 3rd class fare and the berth did not exceed the 1st class fare.In 1936, Members were granted the cost of 1st class sleeping berths, and of theadditional charge on special trains such as the &quot; Coronation Scot &quot;. In 1939Members serving in the Forces were granted free travel between their war stations in the United Kingdom and London, and, in 1942, between their war stations in theUnited Kingdom and the constituency. These two concessions are still in force.In 1935, travel by air between London and the constituency was authorised, anyexcess over the 1st class fare for the corresponding journey by rail or sea beingborne hy the Member.6. On 15th November 1945, on the motion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,free travel by rail or sea for a Member was extended to cover journeys between hisordinary residence and London, and between his ordinary residence and the constituency; and free travel by air was authorised for these journeys and for thej ourney between London and the constituency.APPENDIX IVStatistical Table of the incidence of the claims for expensesby MembersMemorandum by Board of Inland Revenue showing the Expenses as allowed againstthe Income Tax assessments on Members&apos; Salaries(Handed in by Sir Cornelius Gregg, K.C.B., K.B.E.)The following Table gives a statistical classification of the annual rate of expensesallowances made for Income Tax purposes for the current year 1945-46 ending5th April, 1946, against the Income Tax assessments upon Members&apos; Salaries.The Table covers all Members of the present House of Commons from whom claims
