ciRCULAren...HIthis document is the property of his britannic majesty  &apos;s governmentCALL-UP TO THE FORCES IN THE  TRANSITIONAL PERIOD.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Man-Power Committee.THE White Paper on Defence (Cmd. 6743) indicated that the government intended, as soon as possible, to announce that from a given date all new entrants to the Forces would be called up for a definite period and to say what thatperiod should be. We have had three schemes prepared, based on a startingdate of the 1st January, 1947, which we have taken as being the date on whicha fixed scheme of service for new entrants should come into force. Under thefirst scheme (Scheme A), the fixed period starts at 3 years, and under thesecond and third schemes (Schemes B and C) at 2^ and 2 years respectively.Under all three schemes, the period of service is subsequently reduced by stagesto one and a half years. Tables showing the estimated strengths of the services under each of these schemes are set out in Annex I. At Annex II is a statement showing how the period of service would drop under each scheme. Under eachscheme recruitment under war-time conditions will continue until the endof 1946. This will result in the call up of about 100,000 men in the second halfof 1946. All men called up and serving at the end of December 1946 wouldbe released according to age and length of service.2.   We have based our calculations on the following assumptions : (a) That the build-up of regulars and short-service volunteers, which hasbeen estimated by the Service Departments, will come up to the expectation shown in the first group of lines in each table. Judgingby the present rate of recruitment, the estimates are decidedlyoptimistic. Much will depend upon the attractiveness of the induce-ments offered to short-service volunteers and upon a sustained andvigorous recruiting campaign both for regulars and for short-servicevolunteers.(b) That the introduction of a fixed period of service for new entrantswill impose a very definite limit upon the length of time for which men already serving on the date when the new period of service is introduced can be held in the Forces.   It has been assumed^-.(i) that all men who, on the 1st January, 1947, will have alreadyserved for longer than the period fixed for new entrants atthat date will be released during 1947;(ii) that all men called up in 1946 will serve for at least the sameperiod as the men called up in 1947.(c) That the period covered by the tables, i.e., up to 1951, will be a period during which abnormal commitments will persist. (They willprobably continue beyond 1951.) In particular, there will, throughoutthis period, be occupational forces in enemy territory. If this is so,it would be out of the question to reduce the period of service beloweighteen months. Regular strength will not have been completelybuilt up even by the end of this period, and if service were reducedto one year, none of the conscripts could be used abroad. The service ministers consider that it will be hard enough during this period to manage on a period of one and half years&apos; service.Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1946.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (46) 121.22nd March, 1946.CABINET.[31522]b
(d) That the run out of age and length of service categories under thepresent Release Scheme must be complete before the first of the men called up on a fixed period of service become due for release. Thishas been allowed for in all three schemes, as can be seen from thesecond group of lines in each table.3. It will be seen that under all three schemes the most critical period,so far as the strength of the Forces is concerned, will occur in 1947, when therewill be a very large reduction in the strength of the Army at a time when itsoccupational commitments will still be heavy. Thus, in the first half of 1947,the strength of the Army will fall by 134,000 under Scheme A, by 200,000 under scheme B and by 274,000 under Scheme C.4. This drop in the strength of the Army has a direct bearing on thequestion of deferment and postponement of service. The estimates of theregular build-up are not likely to be exceeded, however vigorous the recruitingcampaign and the attractiveness of the inducements offered to short-servicevolunteers, and it will be essential, therefore, to maintain the conscript intakeat as high a level as possible.5. We have accordingly reached the conclusion that there is no alternative to calling up youths at age 18, including until the end of 1947 apprentices and most students, The proposals on which we have based our estimates ofconscript intake are as follows : (a) Complete deferment for men in coalmining and agriculture;(b) Discontinuance of deferments in other industries, except building and building materials and except on hardship grounds;(c) In filling places for students at the Universities first consideration to begiven to the needs of ex-Service men and women, but some allowance,possibly on the basis of 10 per cent., to be made for promising young-men including Arts students. This involves the continued call-up of most Arts students until September 1948.(d) All apprentices to be called up until end 1947 except those deferred as above on industrial grounds. This will mean the call-up of some nowbeing deferred.6. It has been represented to us that these proposals will bear particularlyhardly on the engineering industry, on which we depend so greatly for our industrial recovery and our war potential. On the other hand, quite apart fromthe maintenance of the Army&apos;s intake, it must be borne in mind that many men now in the Forces have had their apprenticeship interrupted or have never hadan opportunity of entering into apprenticeship.7. In the case of the engineering industry, we feel that it may be possibleto ameliorate the position to some extent by increasing the facilities wherebyapprentices may continue their training in the Services. We understand thatthe Secretary of State for War is giving special consideration to this possibility.It is unlikely that it wall be possible to extend any arrangement of this kindbeyond the engineering trade.8. Even under these proposals there will be an unavoidable fall in thestrength of the Army of about 20 per cent, under Scheme A, rising to 40 percent, under Scheme C. It will also be seen that all three Services fall considerably in strength in 1949 and 1950, though the fall is less marked under Scheme A.It must also be remembered that the figures include recruits under training, whowill amount to something between 50,000 and 100,000, and that the effectivestrength of the Services is consequently less than the totals would suggest. the tables do not include women and a small number, falling from 41,000 at the endof 1946 to 20,000 in 1951, should be added for these.9. Looking to our commitments during 1947 and 1948, we have reached theconclusion that Scheme A is the only one which is likely to produce Forces ofthe size which will be required. This, however, is a matter upon which theChiefs of Staff and the Defence Committee must be consulted, and we under-stand that arrangements have been made to refer this paper to the Defence Com-mittee so that the Cabinet may have the views of that Committee on the operationalimplications of our proposals when they come to consider the matter.10. The need for the continuation of military service on the scale we propose in the next few years, when we shall need all the man-power we can
find for productive work, makes it essential, in our view, to review the general question of training and apprenticeship. The raising of the school age to 15,together with a period of military service, which, until 1951 at any rate, willnot be less than 1^ years, represent a serious loss of man-power to industry, andwe do not feel that, on top of all this, the country can afford long periods of apprentiship. Intensive industrial training has proved successful during thewar, and with modern methods of instruction, it should be possible to adjust the age of apprenticeship and to reduce materially the period of apprenticeshipfor the great majority of trades. We suggest, therefore, that concurrently withthe announcement of the proposals for the call-up in the transitional period,the Government should announce that they propose to call upon industry to give further consideration to the need for readjustment of apprenticeship schemes inorder that they may conform to the conditions created by the raising of the schoolage, the increased provision of technical education and the arrangements for compulsory military service.11. Annex III is a statement of the broad distribution of the working population between the Armed Forces and civilian industry and services betweenthe end of 1946 and the end of 1948, on the assumption that the period of conscriptservice will be 3 years at the 1st January, 1947, falling by 6 months in 12 tol\ years at the 1st January, 1950 (Scheme A).12.   The following is a summary of our conclusions : (1) We have limited our examination to the period up to 1951, during whichabnormal military commitments will persist (paragraph 2 (c)).(2) We have prepared three schemes based on a starting date of the1st January7, 1947, which we have taken as being the date on which a fixed scheme of service for new entrants should come into force. Underthe schemes the fixed period starts at 3, 2\ and 2 years respectively(paragraph 1).(3) Under all three schemes there will be a very large reduction in thestrength of the Army in 1947, and we see no alternative to calling upyouths at age 18, including, until the end of 1947, apprentices andsome students. Our calculations have been made on this basis(paragraphs 3, 4 and 5).(4) LookL j to our commitments we conclude that Scheme A, under whichthe period of service starts at 3 years on the 1st January, 1947, andfalls by 6 months in 12 to 1^ years at the 1st January, 1950, is theonly one which is likely to produce Forces of the size likely to berequired. This, however, is a matter upon which the DefenceCommittee and the Chiefs of Staff must be consulted (paragraph 9).(5) We have selected a period of service of 1^ years as the minimum for theperiod under review on the ground that regular strengths will not havebeen completely built up by 1951, and that, accordingly, it will benecessary to use conscripts for occupation and garrison duties abroad.This could not be done if the period of service were reduced toone year (paragraph 2 (c)).(6) We recognise that our proposals for the call-up of apprentices in 1947will bear particularly hardly on the engineering industry, and wesuggest that consideration should be given to the possibility ofincreasing the facilities whereby apprentices may continue their training in the Services (paragraphs 6 and 7).(7) We observe that the raising of the school age to 15, together with a periodof military service which, until 1951, at any rate, will not be less than^ years, will lead to a serious loss of man-power to industry, and wesuggest that, concurrently with the announcement of the proposals forthe call-up in the transitional period, the Government should announce that they propose to call upon industry to give further considerationto the readjustment of apprenticeship schemes in order that they mayconform to the new conditions (paragraph 10).(Initialled) E.
