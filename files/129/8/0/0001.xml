THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1946.SECRET. Copy NOt   38(CP. (46) 101.8th March, 1946.CABINET.LOCATION OF THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE POLITICAL resident in THE PERSIAN GULF.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Political Resident in the Persian Gulf is a British official whose mainfunction is to supervise the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government and theGovernment of India with the British-protected Arab States on the southern sideof the Persian Gulf. Ever since the eighteenth century his headquarters have been maintained at the port of Bushire in Southern Persia. To the Persian Govern-ment his appointment is now notified as &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General atBushire,&quot; and his title of Political Resident is restricted to the Arab side ofthe Gulf.2. The objections to the appointment of this British administrator as aconsular officer in an independent foreign country have long been recognised. Adecision was reached some years ago that the Political Resident would have totransfer his headquarters to the Arab side of the Gulf. It was proposed to acquire a site for building a new Residency at Bahrein, but before any final arrangements were made, or any decision reached regarding the cost of the new building, the1939 war broke out and the matter has since been in abeyance.3. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tehran has recently recommended thatafter the withdrawal of the British troops from Persia on the 2nd March, thePolitical Resident should be withdrawn from Bushire and should have nothingfurther to do with Persia. I have written to my colleague at the India .Officestrongly supporting this view. It seems to me that after the withdrawal ofBritish troops from Persia on the 2nd March, when our Treaty of Alliance withI Persia comes to an end and when the Persians once again become masters in their own house, we must probably expect a certain amount of trouble from the Persians..Russian influence in the country will be very strong, even if the Tehran Govern-ment does not become entirely subservient to Moscow. Thus, we may have a greatdeal of anti-British agitation in Persia, carried out by the Persians themselves,but stimulated by Russian propaganda.4. It may be expected that the retention of the British Political Residenton Persian territory will be one of the main points on which anti-Britishagitation will fasten. Obviously this out-of-date survival from the eighteenthcentury is bound to arouse against us all Persian nationalistic feelings.5. I think that British policy in Persia henceforward should be not only toJrespect the independence and sovereignty of that country and to encourage the^Persians to uphold their own independence and sovereignty, but also to give the persians no reasonable ground for criticism of our arrangements in their country,and to allow the Russians no weak spots on which to concentrate their an+i-british propaganda. I feel that the presence of the British Political Resident in Persiawill from now on be a vulnerable point in our diplomatic position. I regard hisimmediate removal from Bushire as a matter of real importance, and I hope thatpry colleagues will agree that it should be effected without delay. It is surelyIbetter, from every point of view, that we should withdraw him now, while weI&quot;an still do so voluntarily on our own initiative, than to wait until Persianiiationalism, incited by the Russians, is in full cry against us and we are obligedIfto withdraw him ignominiously after much anti-British agitation.13187   [31434]
26. I should perhaps add that the Persians have for many years advanced aridiculous claim to the Arab Stales of Bahrein and Koweit, which are two of thevery territories with whose administration the Political Resident is concerned.The Persian claim to Bahrein has recently been loudly ventilated in the Persianand Soviet press and might give rise to a position where the presence of the resident in Persia might be misrepresented in an embarrassing manner.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1, 8th March, 1946.
