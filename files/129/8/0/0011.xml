THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT,,Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1946.SECRET. Copy  No.CP. (46) 111.15th March, 1946.CABINET.THE CASE OF DEJAZMACH GUGSA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN 1941 the Emperor of Ethiopia requested the British military authoritiesin Ethiopia to surrender his son-in-law, Dejazmach Haile Selassie Gugsa, who,during the Battle of Makalle against the Italians in 1935, went over to the enemyby previous arrangement and thereby largely contributed to the defeat of the ethiopians. The Emperor&apos;s application was submitted by the then Chief Poli-tical Officer, East African Command, to the then Minister of State in Cairo,Mr. Lyttelton. The latter considered the case fully and on his own responsibilityapproved the Chief Political Officer&apos;s advice that Gugsa should not be surrendered to the Emperor, but should be deported. This decision was taken on the grounds that &quot; Gugsa had virtually sought our protection&quot; and that &quot;as a politicalrefugee it would be distasteful to the British public to hand him over to theEmperor.&quot; Following this decision Gugsa was, on the instructions of the ChiefPolitical Officer, East Africa Command, acting through the Deputy ChiefPolitical Officer, Eritrea, given some form of assurance that he would not be handed over to the Emperor. The precise terms of the assurance are unknown,but it seems clear that Gugsa signed a document in the following terms datedthe 27th October, 1941 :- &apos;&quot; I, Ras Haile Selassie Gugsa, hereby freely agree that I am preparedto go to the Seychelles Islands, or to any other British dependency thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should arrange, and that I will not leave theplace selected for me without the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government.I understand that I shall be paid a subsistence allowance until the end ofthe war, when my position will be reviewed.&quot;2. Gugsa was in fact interned in the Seychelles together with relativesand retainers numbering ten in all, and has been paid a subsistence allowanceby His Majesty&apos;s Government ever since.3. The Emperor in 1942 renewed through His Majesty&apos;s Minister in addis ababa his application for the surrender of Gugsa, and Mr. Eden placed a paperdated the 25th May, 1942 (W.P. (42) 221), before the War Cabinet recommending that Gugsa should be handed over to the Emperor subject to assurances to begiven by His Majesty (1) that Gugsa would be properly tried and (2) that, ifsentenced to death, he would be executed in a civilised manner. Before this paper was taken, however, two telegrams were received from the Minister of State in cairo (Mr. Casey), one describing the action taken on Mr. Lytteltohs authority(see paragraph 1 above) and the other reading as follows : &quot; Question of the disposal of Ras Gugsa was definitely settled by my predecessor here.&quot; Gugsa was assured in the name of His Majesty&apos;s Government thathe would not be handed over to the Emperor, and to do so now would be a gross breach of faith. . . .&quot; I consider, therefore, that there is the strongest objection to any changein the already accepted manner of the disposal of Gugsa.&quot;4. The War Cabinet therefore decided on the 2nd June, 1942, that &quot; inview of the commitment entered into Gugsa could not now be surrendered&quot;(W.M. (42) 71st Conclusions).13207   [31486]
5. In October 1945 the Emperor again renewed his request for the handing over of Gugsa, stating that in November 1941 the British military authorities had stated that the position of Gugsa would be reviewed at the &quot; conclusion ofthe war,&quot; ,6. As the result of inter-departmental discussion it was agreed that theinterpretation of the statement signed by Gugsa at the time of his removal to ;theSeychelles was that it was only his position as regards the payment of a subsistence allowance that should be reviewed, and that no reference was intended to theprinciple of his continued retention in British hands. His Majesty&apos;s Charged&apos;Aft&apos;aires at Addis Ababa was accordingly instructed to discuss the matterfrankly with the Emperor, explaining that His Majesty&apos;s Government would stillregard it as a breach of faith to hand over Gugsa and ascertaining, the Emperor&apos;sreaction to our attitude.7. In reply to this approach, the Emperor said that he could only repeat his request for the surrender of Gugsa, who was a deserter and should be tried assuch in his own country, Ethiopia. Britain and America had handed over to eachother deserters they found in Europe and elsewhere; why should they not actsimilarly with Ethiopia ? The Emperor also firmly maintained that the british military authorities&apos; promise that the position would be reviewed at the end ofthe war referred to the whole question of surrender or retention, and not merely to that of the payment of a subsistence allowance.8. The Ethiopian Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs has been instructed bythe Emperor to raise this matter now with the Foreign Office in London.9. From the Foreign Office point of view, this is an embarrassing matter.The decision not to surrender Gugsa was not only bad in international law, butcontrary to the general policy of handing over Quislings to the countries theyhad sought to betray. On the other hand, we have given our word to Gugsathat he will not be surrendered, and unless the Cabinet are prepared to go backon their previous decision the only apparent solution in the circumstances, viz.,that we should cease, to finance Gugsa and free him from detention in the hopethat he would thereby be forced to return to Ethiopia on his own initiative, met with no favour in the Emperor&apos;s eyes.10. I do not much like this business of protecting this traitor and Italianhireling merely because we understand that the Deputy Chief Political Officerat Eritrea in 1941 gave him an assurance that he would not be handed over to theEmperor. Such an assurance if given was surely ultra- vires and cannot surelybind His Majesty&apos;s Government indefinitely. No doubt Gugsa sought our protec-tion, as stated by the then Minister of State in Cairo, but I doubt very muchwhether on that account it would be &quot; distasteful to the British public to handhim over to the Emperor.&quot; On the contrary, if we continue to maintain himindefinitely at the expense of the British taxpayer I think we shall be laying upfor ourselves all sorts of troubles.11. For these reasons I think we should face and solve the difficulty straightaway by handing Dejazmach Gugsa over to the Emperor, and I should be glad of the Cabinefs approval of this course.ERNEST BEVIN.Foreign Office, March 15, 1946.
