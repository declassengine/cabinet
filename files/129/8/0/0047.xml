SECRET copy No.O CC. P. (46) 147xoth April, 1946.CABINETDESPATCH OF FAMILIES TO B.A.O.R.JOINT MEMORANDUM BY THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY OF THEADMIRALTY, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR, THE SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR AIR AND THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster. Arrangements are already in force under which the wives and families of Service-men and of Civil Servants may proceed to certain overseas stations, including Austria.These arrangements do not yet apply to North-West Europe, nor in particular toGermany. - .....2. There is a special reason for making this concession for the Army.As the run-down of the Army proceeds, the numbers serving in the United kingdom will dwindle rapidly. Apart from men awaiting their release, the only troops at homewill shortly be those under training and those serving in base installations. &apos; Menreturning under the Python scheme after long service away cannot, therefore, all be absorbed in the home establishment and increasing numbers will have to be posted toGermany which, for this purpose, will become a &quot; home station &quot;.In normal peace conditions there is provision for the families of officers. and mento be accommodated in married quarters in home stations and, if these quarters are insufficient to accommodate all the families, it is open to officers and men to house their families in the vicinity. It is, however, for obvious reasons impossible for them to doso on the Continent.3. For the other two Services and for the staffs of the Control Commission, manyof whom are serving on overseas engagements of up to 7 years duration, it is also desirable on general grounds that the men should not be denied a privilege open to thoseserving in other theatres. It is, of course, important, for reasons of morale and recruit-ment, that there should be equal treatment between the Services and the civil andmilitary staff of the Control Commission.4. We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that officers and men of the three services and members of the Control staff serving in North-West Europe who have more than one year&apos;s service there in front of them should, in principle, be allowed tohave their wives and families with them if they so wish.5. We feel, however, that it would be unwise to start any movement of familiesat the present time when, owing to the food situation, there is grave distress among thecivil population of Germany and a possibility of disorder.6. What we seek is a decision in principle so that preparatory steps may be taken.These would include the manufacture in Germany of bedding and furniture and thecleaning and decoration of quarters. A brief statement showing the main features ofthe scheme we have in mind is attached at Annexure A.The estimated cost of the scheme is shown in Annexure B.J. D.J- J- L.S.J. B.

A rent will be charged.Education, Medical Attention, Amenities, etc.Free education in Germany of children age 5 to r5 to a standard equivalent to thatobtaining in the United Kingdom: the Ministry of Education are assisting in thenecessary arrangements.A full medical and dental service will be provided free (subject to the recovery ofthe same charges as for regular families). Rations will be provided on full repaymentrates.  N.A.A.F.I. shops and clubs will be provided.Owing to the lack of public transport facilities in Germany, families will be allowedto use Service transport on repayment.Numbers.A provisional estimate of the number of wives likely to take advantage of thescheme gives:  R.N.: 270. Army: 6,100. R.A.F.: 2,200. Control Commission: 330 (military),1,090 (civil).Total: say 10,000; or including children, say, 22,500.ANNEXURE B to CP (46) 147COSTThese figures assumed commencement of the scheme on 1st May, 1946. Postpone-ment will affect the incidence of the cost of certain items as between the initial year andsucceeding years: e.g., the educational scheme can only be fully implemented by early1947 at the earliest.A. In first year (includinginitial expenditure)(1) Accommodation (rents, decoration,furniture, bedding, etc.)(2) Transport (chartering of vessels,British and German railways, etc.)(3) Medical Service(4) Education (teachers, books, accom-modation) ...Total, gross costR.Ms.68,600,000410,000Sterling 420,000 170,000 33.ooo400,000        60,00069,400,000       683,000B.

Rents to be charged to the families would produce, on existing scales, anoffset to the sterling charge amounting to about:  270,000  500,000(These scales are under consideration in connection with the new pay code)Net cost...............69,400,000       413,000 23,970,000      70,000Note. These figures of cost are based upon the provisional estimate of numbers given above. It is likely that the numbers who will in fact take advantage of the scheme will fall short of this estimate.   The figures of cost, therefore, may be regarded as on the high side.(B46/13)   120   4/46   w.o.p.   25403
