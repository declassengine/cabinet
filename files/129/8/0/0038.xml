THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 194b\SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 138.^,lpn7, 1946.CABINET.CALL-UP TO THE FORCES IN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD.Note by the Lord President of the Council.I think it will be useful for the Cabinet to have before them, when considering the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum CP. (46) 121 of the22nd March, on the Call-Up to the Forces in the Transitional Period, the annexednote of the views of the Board of Trade on this matter.H. M.Of/ices of the Lord President of the Council,Great George Street, S.W.1,4th April, 1946.Note by the Board of Trade.THE amount of man-power that Britain can afford to devote to the heedsof the Forces during the next few years must be a decision of nice balance between military and economic advantage. Economic recovery is a matter of operational urgency, and on a long view there may be little gain from maintaininglarge armed Forces if the result is that in the economic field we become a second-class Power.2. It is important, therefore, to consider the economic as well as the militaryconsequences of the call-up now proposed. This would be serious from theeconomic point of view in two ways :  (a) It would represent a heavy drain on our man-power, more particularlyin the younger and fitter age groups where shortage is now most felt.(b) It would continue to present a serious obstacle to both technical and professional training.3. As to (a), we are anxious that the Chiefs of Staff, in considering the implications of our overseas commitments, shall have before them the essentialfacts of the industrial ancl economic situation as we see them.4. We have been able to set a man-power target for direct employment onmanufactured exports at the end of 1946 only about 50 per cent, above pre-war.As production expands and capacity becomes available it will be necessary toincrease the man-power on exports during 1947-8 by a further 250,000-300,000in order that a balance of payments may be achieved.5. The man-power that will remain to meet the needs of the home market,as well as to provide the services common to all industry, will be about 16,090,000at December 1946. The corresponding figure at December 1948, if Scheme A is adopted, will be no more than some 15,850,000-15,900,000. Should the total of500,000 workers providing supplies and equipment for the Forces prove inadequateas present stocks are exhausted, the man-power available for the home marketwill be further reduced. Thus on the basis of Scheme A there will be a reductionfather than an increase of man-power available to meet the needs of the home market over the next two years, at a time when the volume of investment in industrial reconstruction must be expected to increase rather than diminish.[31606]
:&apos;. 6. Only on the basis of Scheme C would it be possible to maintain theend-1946 position, which, we had hoped, would represent no more than a first instalment in the improvement of our reduced standards of life. The effect onour industrial recovery is, moreover, likely to be far greater than is measured by the figure of 200,000 workers that is the difference between Scheme A andScheme C. They represent the young and fit age groups in which mobility andadaptability are highest, and their loss would reduce our powers to breakimportant bottlenecks and to achieve the expansion of manufacturing industry that is essential to the achievement of our export targets, and the recovery ofeconomic strength and equilibrium.7. As to the possible effects on professional and technical training, it isalready abundantly clear that our future economic standards and our chances of achieving an economic equilibrium rest primarily on the possibilities ofincreasing output per head. While more and better capital equipment will con-tribute to this objective, an increase of individual personal efficiency is an essential element. A gap of seven years during which technical and professional training will have been far below normal must remain an obstacle for many years tocome. The prolongation of this gap would be doubly serious. The period durincwhich technical and professional training can be acquired cannot be extendedwithout limit, and a call-up for three years makes very heavy inroads into the vital few years when training is effectively possible.8. As a partial mitigation of this clanger, we associate ourselves with theMinistry of Supply in a plea for granting deferment to bona fide apprenticesuntil their term,has been completed, subject, it may be, to the tests of proficiencywhich were current during the war.9. Whichever Scheme may be adopted, the problems of deferment are likelyto present great difficulties. We are not convinced that the proposals at presentput forward in paragraph 5 (a) and (b) properly reflect the relative priorities and urgencies of the various economic objectives of the Government. Thedevelopment of exports has been generally accepted as an objective second tonone, and provision will need to be made for deferment in exceptional cases toprevent bottlenecks in important exporting industries. There are other cases in which small numbers of deferments on industrial grounds will certainly bedesirable, though we would accept the view that very strict tests should be applied.10. We would ask that the full implications of these economic considerationsbe weighed against the equally vital military considerations before any finaldecision is made as to the scale of military forces that the nation can support overthe next few years. Should it be decided that, in the present state of international relations, either Scheme A or Scheme B is inescapable, we would hope that thewhole system of call-up and service may be kept as flexible as possible, so that, ifevents take a more favourable turn, there may be a quick reduction in the periodof service.Board of Trade, Millbank, S.W. 1,4\th April, 1946.
