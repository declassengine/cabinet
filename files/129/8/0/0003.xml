22    /THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C R E TCP. (46) 1056TH MARCH. 1946COPY HO.CABINETBRICK PRODUCTIONJoint Memorandum &quot;py Secretary of State forScotland. Minister of Healthana Minister of Works1,      Before the war about 37,000 workers produced an averageof approximately 650 million bricks a month.At the end of January 1945 there were 18,270 workers and during the month IkO million bricks were produced:  one-thirdof the pre-war labour force produced a little more thanone-fifth of the pre-war production of bricks.2.      Capacity exists for production at the pre-war level Toutthe net increa.se in the labour force has been disappointinglysmall.      For the six months August 1945 to January I9I4.6 this increase amounted to 5,871,        average of less than 1,000 amonth.      The rate of increase has improved but even inJanuary 1946 it &quot;was only at the level of approximately 2,000a month, (3,      Production and deliveries of bricks in the period August1945 to January 192+6 are shown below (all figures to the nearest mil1ion):MonthAugust 1945September 1945October 1945November 1945December 1945January 19/Production	Deliveries		Deficiency	88 million	100 mi	11 ion	12	million102        &quot;		11	23	11119        &quot;	169	ii	50	11125        &quot;	181	11	56	11114        &quot;	lo3	u	54	11140        &quot;	208	11	68	it	Total	deficiency 263		114.      At 31st January, 1946 the total stock of bricks inGreat Britain was returned at 913 million.      Of these stocksprobably 10% are unfit for use.      5/1 million of the stockconsists of Fletton bricks, which are stacked in the areaPeterborough/Bedford.      Owing to transport costs F^ettonbricks cannot be supplied economically to the more&quot;distantparts of the country and a true picture of the brick positioncannot be obtained by setting estimated demand againstestimated production and total stocks nominally available.5.      The following table shows labour available and estimated to be available, bricks produced and estimated to be produced,bricks delivered and estimated to be required, on the basisof the following assumptions;(a) A net increase in the available labour of 3,000 a month from February 1946 onwards (as state.Paragraph 2 the average net increase in the six monthrorce at the rate(as stated intoJanuary 1946 was slightly less than 1,000 a month)-1-

(b) That production of finished &quot;oriclcs will follow twomonths after the intake of labour.(c) That each worker will produce on average 10,000 bricksa month.      The pre-war figure was rather over 11,000; thefigure towards the end of 192+5 was rather &quot;below 9,000&quot;.Month	Labour	Production		Demand   &apos;		DeficiencyNov. 191+5	15,82+0					Dec.    &quot;	l6,02iO					Jan. 192+6	18,270	12+0	raillj.cn	208	rail lion	68 millionFob.    &quot;	21,270	11+2		280	tt	138       &quot;March &quot;	2k,270	161	it	350	11	189       &quot;April &quot;	27,270	191	ii	2+20	it	229       &quot;May      &quot;	30,270	221	ii	2+90	11	269       &quot;June    11	33,270	251	1!	562	11	311July   11		281	II	571	11	290       &quot;Aug.    &quot;		311	II	580	11	269       11						1,763 millionEven if all	bricks	stocks we r	e useable	thii	3 table s	hows thatthey will be completely exhausted by June 192+6.6.      It may be that estimated demands which have been calculated by the Ministry of Works are somewhat over-stated.It is also possible that production may somewhat exceed theabove expectations, but the gap between probable productionand probable demand is so wide as to make it clear that reallydrastic action must &quot;be taken if a complete breakdown of the traditional housing and other nationally important building programmes is to be avoided.7.      The measure of success in dealing with this situationdepends almost entirely upon the increase in labour whichcan be made effective in the industry and the following steps are recommended:-(a) A most urgent need is for the return to the brickmakingindustry of experienced workers now in the Forces.      UnderGlass B, out of about i+,900 asked for under the Block Releaseand Nomination Schemes, less than 1,000 have actuallyresumed brickmaking.      About one half of the men approachedprefer to await Class A release.      It is, therefore, proposedthat all experienced brick-workers in the Forces be offeredimmediate release on Class A terms,  those in this countrybeing given indefinite leave so that they may resumeemployment in brickworks pending actual demobilisation.In this connection it is pointed out that during thewar, when production emergencies arose in the Aircraft Industry,Royal Air Force personnel were released in considerable numbers from the Forces for employment in Aircraft Factories,The emergency in the Brick Industry is grave and appearsto warrant the suggested departure from demobilisationprocedure.(b) Maximum possible employment of German prisoners-of-wer.The Minister of Works is encouraging this and no substantialdifficulties in the provision of prisoners or of accommodation is anticipated.      It will be necessary to ensure that these prisoners, who will be engaged on heavy work, receive adequatefood.

(c) The application to the Building Materials Industries ingeneral, and to brickworks particularly, of the assistedtravel scheme which was applied in Munitions Industriesduring the war.      This will facilitate the intake intocrickyards of workers at present unemployed, who are livingoutside normal daily travel distances.(d) The appointment of an adequate number of Ministry ofLabour officials with the solo task of investigating thelabour requirements of brick and other clay industry works,and of taking all possible steps to ensure that they arefilled either by an inflow of ordinary workers, or by theintroduction of prisoners-of-war.(e) Drastic direction of labour for men under 30 years of age and rigorous application of the Essential V/ork Order to limit the present heavy wastage.Consideration of the extension to the brickmaking industry of the scheme&apos;under which young men liable to call-up forthe Forces can instead opt for work in coal-mines.(f) The grant to brick workers of the same extra cheeseration as is given to agricultural workers.      The work isheavy and in many cases,  as with agricultural workers, thereare no facilities for meals other than those which the mencan themselves provide.(g) Priority to brick and other clay industry works of thesupply of coal necessary for the full use of their available-production facilities and in the provision of transport toensure speedy movement of products from works to site.    A(h) The utmost economy by all Government Departments, bothin their own building and in building which they sponsoroutside the housing field, in the consumption of bricks.(i) Exploration of the possibility of importing Continentalbricks, particularly facing bricks.(Intld. )   J.W.A.B.&amp; It ,-Cabinet Office, S.W.I.8th March, 19h7.
