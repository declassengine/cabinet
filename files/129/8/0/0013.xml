SECRETCP, (US) 1131 5th March,  1 9U6.CIVIL AVIATION bill memorandum by the President of the Board of trade.       Clause iq. ( i) of the Bill in its present form reads: -&quot;None of the. three corporations shall,  except withthe approval of the Minister or in accordance with theterms of any general authority given by him, use inconnection with any service operated by them anyaircraft, airframes or aero-engines designed or manufactured outside His Majesty&apos;s Dominions,- or anyaircraft accessories so manufactured or any equipmentso manufactured&quot;.2.. This provision in its present form is open to two serious objections from the point of view of external commercial policyand trade relations.3.        The first objection arises from the &quot;Proposals forconsideration by an International Conference on Trade andEmployment&quot; (Cmd.  6709)  issued by the U.S.  Government, withwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government have declared that  they are&quot;in full agreement on all important points&quot;.-These Proposals contemplate international negotiationsfor reduction of tariffs and trade barriers of all kinds,  andpostulate that in such negotiations we should be prepared tomake modifications of Imperial Preference &quot;in conjunction with adequate measures for the substantial reduction of barriers to world trade&quot; as part of &quot;mutually advantageous    arrangement s&quot;.-(Chapter III B 1 ).The Proposals also make specific provision for state trading (Chapter III E),  in the sense that &quot;members engaging in State trading in any form should give equality of treatment to all other members.      To this end members should undertakethat the foreign purchases and sales of their Staffs tradingenterprises shall be governed solely by commercial considerations,such as price,  quality,&quot; etc.The reference to &quot;State trading&quot; must clearly be takento cover State or publicly-owned industrial and transportenterprises in respect of their purchases.There could hardly be a more direct and obvious denial of this principle than a provision in permanent legislationrequiring the air-transport corporations to buy only british or Empire-manufactured and designed aircraft and components,even though this is subject to possible approval by the Ministerof acquisitions from other sources.      This would in effect amountto unlimited protection for the U.K.  aircraft-manufacturing industry and to 100 per cent preference for the Empireindustry.COPY NO.cabinet this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)

k*       As against this,  it may be argued that the rule of&quot;commercial consideration&quot; cannot properly be applied topurchases of aircraft by the Corporations, given the temporarylead which fortuitous circumstances have given to Americanmanufacture. .Such a contention would not, however, be valid;    for theProposals provide for a post-war transition period in whichthe rules would not apply in their full rigour.      They would,therefore, not prevent a temporary preference for british aircraft, provided that after the transition the  rule of&quot;commercial considerations&quot; of price, quality, etc. would comeinto operation,  subject to such protective margins (in thenature of tariffs) as may be fixed.      (These protectivemargins would be subject to negotiation like ordinary tariffs).5.       In these circumstances it is clear that the enacting of clause *h(i) in its present form would have a most unfortunate effect and would cast doubt upon the bona fides of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.6.        Px*obably an even more  serious objection to the present proposal in the Civil Aviation Bill is that it would set an example for State industrial,  transport and trading enterprisesin other countries to require  that only nationally-producedmaterial be used.      In view of the probable widespread growth of State enterprise in many countries, such a requirement mighthave the most prejudicial effects on the export of U.K.manufactures of industrial and transport material (including aircraft),  and seriously hamper our efforts to increase our exports to the point necessary to balance our external payments and to pay for our essential imports of food and raw materials.7.        I urge strongly,  therefore,  that the form of the sub-clause should be modified,  in the sense that it should requirethe corporations to obtain the Ministers&apos;s assent to theiracquisition of aircraft and components generally.      It wouldthen be possible for the Minister to give nn open generalpermit to the corporations to acquire aircraft and componentsmanufactured in the U.K.  and the Empire, while his specific  :approval would still have to be obtained for foreignacquisitions.-    (A draft of a possible alternative sub-clauseon these lines is annexed).8.        If the clause were re-cast on these lines,  it would notin fact prevent approval being withheld as an act of policy,even- though material of equal quality and performance wasobtainable from foreign services at lower prices;    but itwould avoid the public adoption of a policy which runs counter to the principles of international trade at present being pursued,  and which,  if adopted by other countries in this andother spheres of activity, would have results greatly to our   .disadvantage.9.        The Minister of Civil Aviation opposes  this suggestionon the following grounds:-(a) The requirement to use British aircraft is in theBritish Overseas Airways Act and suspicion would bearoused if it were nut in the new Bill.(b) It has been stated in the White Paper (Gmd.  6712)that &quot;It will be the general policy of H.M.G.to require the Corporations to use British aircrafttypes&quot;.

(c) There is suspicion that certain officials inB.O.A.C. are so enthusiastic about the merits of american aircraft that they will not use british aircraft unless they are required to do so.10.      I cannot regard any of these objections as decisive.As regards (a),  the reference is to Section 3(1 ) of theBritish Overseas Airways Act 1939 (from which the wording of Clause h. (i)  of the present Bill is ta.-cen with smallmodification).      This Act was passed before the war,  underanother Government and Parliament;    before the Americans hadtaken their initiative for the liberalisation and expansionof international trade;    before H.M.G.   had associated themselves with this initiative;    and also (it may be added) before thebasis of a general understanding on civil aviation had beenreached with the Americans at the Bermuda Conference.11.      As regards (b),  it is not suggested that the generalpolicy as stated in the White Paper should be departed from.This could indeed be stated when defending the suggestedalternative form of sub-Clause.      But it might be added that.M.G.  naturally expect British aircraft manufacturing- industryto bring themselves as rapidly as possible to a state of efficiency at least as high as any corresponding foreignindustry;    that they will,  of course, require  time to overtakethe lead which war conditions have given to the Americanindustry, and that the Government&apos;s intention is to give themthis necessary time;    but that if,  after all, they do notfulfil our hope,  they must not be encouraged to look for the indefinite continuance of unlimited protection.      (an appreciation of the latter print by the British industry mayindeed be an important factor in ensuring energy and enterpriseon their part).12.      As to (c), the officials of B.O.A.C.  can be  just as effectively required to use British aircraft under thealternative sub-Clause now proposed as under the existingClause.13.      The Minister of Civil Aviation says that failure to makestatutory the requirement to buy British aircraft would castdoubt on the good faith of the Government.I submit that no such accusation could be based on thealternative provision proposed, which would leave the minister with full control.      There could only be a breach of faithif the British industry had been led to suppose that their products would always be used,  irrespective of allconsiderations of relative efficiency.      It would surely be excessive to read a promise of that kind into the words ofthe White Paper.1h.      The Minister of Civil Aviation concludes that an amendment on the lines of the existing British OversearAirways Act (see paragraph 10 above) would inevitably beintroduced in the House of Commons and that he does not see how the Government could resist it.If such an amendment were moved it could,  in my opinion,convincingly be resisted on the grounds set out above,particularly paragraphs 3,  6 and 11..R.
