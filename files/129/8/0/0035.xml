SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 135.1st April, 1946CABINET.CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN THE CHANNEL ISLANDS...Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. / recommend that a Committee of the Privy Council be appointed. toexamine proposals submitted by the Estates of Jersey and Guernsey for constitu--tional reform. -2. When&apos;the Channel Islands were liberated in Mayl945, it was clear frontrepresentations reaching the Home Office that there was a fairly widespread desireamong the populations for reform of the local constitutions to bring them more into line with modern ideas and practice. At that time the Governing Assembliesof the Islands (the States of Jersey and of Guernsey) were time-expired, but hadbeen kept in office by emergency legislation, and it was clear that elections shouldhave taken place before proposals for reform could be properly discussed. In astatement, which I made in Parliament on the 17th August, I said that there was evidence that there was in the Islands a demand for certain changes to bring theconstitutions more into line with modern ideas and that I had every confidence thatthe Islanders would themselves be anxious that the question of reform should be examined. Since that time there has been full discussion in the Islands of pro-posals for reform and elections to the local Assemblies were held on a universalfranchise in December last. The newdy-elected xA.ssemblies have debated andproduced their recommendations for reform which have been sent to me before any legislation is prepared and enacted by the States in order that it might be ascer-tained whether the reforms contemplated are likely to be acceptable to HisMajesty&apos;s advisers.3.   The reforms proposed are, very briefly, as follows : Jersey Legislative Assembly (the States).Present Constitution. Proposed Neiv Constitution.President the   Bailiff   of   Jersey.      President no change.Appointed by the Crown.12 Jurats elected by popular fran- 12 Jurats to be elected as at present,,franchise over the whole Island they hold but to be subject to re-election on corn-office for life and they are also Members pletion of 6 years&apos; service; and possiblyof the Royal Court. to receive a new style of description ifthey cease to be judges both of law andfact and become more like Jurors.12    Rectors nominated    by    the      The Rectors no longer to sit in theCrown. States, but the Dean of Jersey to have a,right of addressing the Assembly, butnot of voting.12  Constables elected  by  popular      12 Constables no change,franchise    in    their    constituenciesbienniallv.17 Deputies elected by popular fran- 28 Deputies with a redistributionchise intheir constituencies triennially.   of seats.3 Crown Officers the Attorney- 3 Crown Officers no change.General and Solicitor-General, who are appointed by the Crown and have thel&quot;ight of addressing the Assembly but have no vote; and the Viscount, alsoappointed by the Crown, who has a seatbut no right of vote or speech.[31579]

There are also proposals for reform of the Royal Courts in each Island.These envisage broadly that the Jurats -who are at present popularly elected for life in Jersey, and are elected by an electoral college for life in Guernsey should no longer be judges of law and fact, but that the Bailiff should be sole judge of law, and the Jurats should be judges of fact, i.e., that the Jurats should belay jurors. Specific proposals, into the detail of which I need not enter, havebeen made by Jersey, but it may be some weeks before the Guernsey proposals are ready. Suggestions have also been made for simplifying the work of thecourts, and there is a proposal that there should be a joint Channel Islands Courtof Appeal which would hear cases from the Royal Court of each Island withoutprejudice to any right of further appeal to the Privy Council.5. A brief examination of the proposals as regards the principal matter,namely, the constitution of the Legislative Assemblies, will serve to show thatthey represent a considerable broadening of the basis of representation. In eachAssembly the numbers of representatives elected on the basis of universal suffragewill, for the first time, exceed the numbers elected on a narrower basis; and apartfrom the Crown Officers, there will hereafter be no member with voting rightswho is not an elected representative. On the other hand, many of the earliercharacteristics, which might be regarded as somewhat archaic, are retained with- or without modification. In my view, it is not possible to judge these proposals on an abstract basis. The Islands are peouliar communities with deeply-rootedhistorical instincts and traditions, and their point of view can probably be fully appreciated only as the result of study on the ground. On that account therewould be much to be said for a special enquiry on the spot.6. In addition, the reforms proposed affect the Royal Prerogative in the islands in that they deal, inter alia, with the constitutional position of certainofficers appointed by the Crown. For this reason, too, apart from general considerations, I should favour enqury on the spot.7. I therefore suggest that the best method to consider the proposals inrespect both of the legislative assemblies and of the courts would be to refer themfor examination to a Committee of the Privy Council which -would visit the
Islands and take evidence. This Committee would, no doubt, be at liberty totake evidence not only from the States but also from various minority groups and from members of the public who wished to express their views.8. The Lieutenant-Governors of both Islands have written to me torecommend for consideration that such a Committee should visit the Islands.They consider that a Royal Commission would be inappropriate, but that a small committee of the Privy Council would be very well received on all sides andwould be regarded as indicating His Majesty&apos;s personal desire to receive thefullest possible advice from his Privy Council on matters of vital concern to the islands.9. I suggest, therefore, that I be authorised to invite the Lord Presidentof the Council to appoint a Committee of three Privy Councillors to examine theproposals; the terms of reference and the manner in which the Committee shouldbe given the necessary authority to take evidence wrould be settled between the privy Council Office and the Home Office.J.
