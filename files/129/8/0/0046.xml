CABINETAGRICULTURAL ...-.C-ESMemorandum by Minister of Agriculture and fisheries.    The Minister of Labour has reported in CP. (46)  145the results of the discussions that have taken place between theNational Farmers&apos;  Union and the Agricultural Workers&apos; Unionsunder the auspices of his Department on the subject of the grading of agricultural wages.    There are only three points that I wishto emphasise as regards the facts of the situation:(i)    The workers&apos;  side has made it clear from thecutset that it is far less interested at themoment in the subject of wage grading than inthat of minimum wages;(ii)    I  understand that while the Rational Farmers&apos;Union agree that an improvement in agricultural wages relative to those in other industries isnecessary if additional labour is to be attractedto the land,  any   welcome&quot; they could give to a renewed application by the workers&apos;   side must be conditional on un understanding that produceprices would be adjusted to take account of theadditional wages costs;(iii)    It is plain that both sides of the industry regardwage grading as nothing more than a long termpossibility;  and it has to be recognised thatin such an industry as agriculture, where unitsof production and numbers employed by each are usually very small,   the practical difficultiesarc formidable.In spite of that,  I am at one with the Minister of Le bour inhoping that progress will be made with this matter as soon aspossible.2.    The concrete suggestion made by the Minister of Le bour asregards the immediate issue - the minimum wage - is that,   as in thecase of bricks,  the employers should be put in a position toegree with the workers on some reasonable wage increase by being given an assurance that,  if they do so,  the prices of agricultural products will be reviewed speedily and sympathetically.     It isplain that without  some such assurance,   the employers must feelunable to reach such an agree merit;  and,   if they did,  it would bethe Government as well as farmers that would feel the directeffect-.    Either the Government would in feet have to review pricesso as to take full account of the wage increase given;  or,alternatively,   the Government would be faced with the position that the profitability of the industry would be lower than was contemplated at the last February review and that,  in consequence,the desired volume of production would almost certainly not beachieved.    For these reasons among others the Notional FarmersUnion have,   so far,  felt - quite naturally and properly to my mind that they must leave the final responsibility for the decision&quot;ith the impartial element   on the Wages Board.I-

3.    The immediate question now raised hy the Minister ofLabour is whether some assurance on prices should be given eitherto the National Farmers&apos; Union or to the Agricultural Wages Board,in this connection,  I can only draw the attention of my colleagues to the conclusions retched by the Lord President&apos;s Committee attheir mooting on 25th January,  1245,  and endorsed by the Crbinetat their meetings on 51st January and again on 7th February,  194S.It is still the position that if the Government were to give the suggested assurance about prices,  it would virtually be acceptingresponsibility for c decision to increase wages;  and if theEssurtnco were relabel to some specific sum,  it would be acceptingresponsibility for the amount of that wage increase.    I cannot,therefore,  recommend this course to my colleagues.4.    It is the plain intention of agricultural wages legislation that in fixing minimum wages the Agricultural Wages board shouldhave regard to all relevant considerations.    There is no good reason to think that they did not do so when coming to their decision on 2nd January last to reject that part  of the applicationwhich asked for an increase in the minimum for adult male workers.(Other parts of the application have,   in fact,   been approved.)Since then,  however,conditions have changed.    In particular, wide publicity ha s been given to the serious world food situation for the next few years,   and stress lies be .n laid on the necessityfor maintaining -and,   if possible,  increasing home food production.It is c ommonly recognised,   too,   that the labour left on the landwhen prisoners of war have to go will be gravely insufficient tomaintain production and that means must be found to induce morelabour to enter agriculture.    There will,  no doubt,   also be  someother &quot;new circumst; nces:l  - such as recent wage increases in otterindustries - which the Wages Board would,  at the same time, wish to&quot;kake into account.5.    One suggestion made in the First Report of the Working party on Wages Policy (&quot;para.  25)  is,  as I understand it,   that in futuremajor economic factors,   such as some of those  I have mentioned above,should be brought to the notice of all wage fixing authorities through .Government White Papers.    If it is agreed that any step should now betaken to assist the Agricultural Wages Board to review their decisionof January last,  it seems clear that this should be done publiclyend not by way of hints conveyed merely to either the employers&apos;   sideor the impartial element.    The only practicable suggestion of that kind that I can recommend to my colleagues is that which I made at theCabinet meeting of 7th February.6*    In View,  therefore; of the difficulty of the position andoi the importance Of finding some way of assisting towards a solutionwithout saddling the Government with responsibility for wage increasesi&apos;nd Gven v*&apos;age levels,   I venture to recommend again that a parliamentary question should be &quot;inspired&quot; on the following lines,  and that a simpleaifirma-tive answer should be given to it:-&quot;To ask the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries whether,in his opinion,  it would be appropriate for theAgricultural Wages Board to have regard to the presentfood outlook and the continuing heed for every effort to increase food production at home,  among other factors,   in considering any further.application thatmight be made for an increase in the agricultural minimum wage.&quot;

I believe that this should assist the Wages Board end theagricultural industry,  and would at ell events be far less of ah embarrassment to the Government than any alternativethat lias yet been proposed.rp   imMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries10th April,   1946.
