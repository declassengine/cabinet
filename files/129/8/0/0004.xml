THIS DOCUMBNT IS THE PROPSRTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJKSTY&apos;S GOYERNTKEHTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1946.SECRET. Copy No.       3 8CP. (46) 104.9th March, 1946.CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS ETHIOPIA: FUTURE OF THE SOMALITERRITORIES.Memorandum by the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affaiks and for the.Colonies.1. The Ethiopian Minister for Foreign Affairs has arrived in London with instructions from the Emperor to discuss with His Majesty&apos;s Government thewhole range of Anglo-Ethiopian relations. The discussions are intended to clear the way for a subsequent visit by the Emperor himself to England.2. Among the subjects which the Ethiopians wish to raise are the future ofthe Italian colonies adjacent to Ethiopia (namely Eritrea and Italian Somaliland)and the &quot;rectification&quot; of the frontiers with neighbouring British territories.The frontiers concerned are those of Kenya, the Sudan and British Somaliland.In considering the line to be taken on the British side in these discussions, animportant point of policy arises in connection with British Somaliland on whichwe think it desirable to consult our colleagues.3. The question affects the future not only of British Somaliland but also ofthe other Somali-inhabited territories; namely, the Ogaden and the ReservedArea of Ethiopia, and Italian Somaliland. The view has long been held in many quarters that the right policy is to unify these territories under one adminis-tration, in order to remove arbitrary and troublesome frontiers and to give theinhabitants themselves a better chance of future development. The arguments infavour of a unified Somalia were set out in full in a memorandum which wecirculated to the Overseas Reconstruction Committee before the Council of foreign ministers met in London last September (O.R.C. (45) 21), and they need not be repeated here. The proposal at that time was that the unified territory shouldbe administered under a trusteeship with the United Kingdom as administering authority. Owing to developments at the Council of Foreign Ministers (namely,the Russian claim for Tripolitania and the United States counter-proposal for collective trusteeships administered by the United Nations Organisation itself),the proposal for a unified Somalia under British trusteeship was not put forwardinternationally at that time, nor did the matter ever come before the Cabinet.4. Since then, the Departments concerned have been studying the american proposals for collective trusteeship, in accordance with the instructions remittedby the Council of Foreign Ministers to their Deputies. A report covering thewhole field has been prepared and will be ready shortly. In the course of pre-paring this report it has become apparent that the substitution of collectivetrusteeship for British trusteeship would not affect the merits of the case for seeking to create a unified Somalia. Sucii unification would undoubtedly be farpreferable to a return to the status quo which appears the only other alternative.The existing artificial division of the territory makes normal administration most difficult and any constructive development impossible. The local British military administration have warmed us that the Somalis would resist, possibly by force, a return to Ethiopian (or to Italian) rule. From the British point of view, a returnto the status quo would leave the British Somali tribes without the essentialgrazing grounds which lie on the other side of the old Ethiopian frontier.   Since13196   [31452]
2the linking of these grazing grounds with British Somaliland is vital to the welfare of our tribes, we should be bound, failing the creation of a unified Somalia,to seek to persuade Ethiopia to cede these areas direct to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, a course which would present obvious international difficulties. Moreover,from the international point of view, the adoption of the American proposal for collective trusteeship appears to offer the best way of countering the Russianattempt to gain the sole trusteeship of certain parts of the former Italian Empire,thus for the first time gaining a foothold in Africa.5. We do not wish to anticipate the comprehensive report on the italian colonies referred to above, but for all these reasons it is certain that our interest,and that of the inhabitants, lies in sponsoring the creation of a unified Somaliaunder trusteeship. If, as seems probable, it is decided that the trusteeship shouldbe collective rather than purely British, it would be necessary, before offering to place the British Somaliland Protectorate under collective trusteeship, toconsider the following two points at the appropriate stage : (a) We should be bound to consult the inhabitants of British Somalilandbefore a final decision is taken. We are in any case committed tothis on account of past pledges in Parliament.(b) It would be necessary for the Chiefs of Staff to confirm that no vitalBritish strategic interest would be prejudiced.The Dominion Governments (particularly South Africa) would in any case haveto be consulted, at some stage before a final decision was taken to place british somali land under any form of trusteeship.6. The question of a unified Somalia and the time and manner in whichthe project can be launched internationally, are necessarily bound up withthe question of the disposal of the Italian colonies, the meetings of the Deputiesof the Council of Foreign Ministers, and the projected Peace Conference at paris in May. The two questions are linked not only through Italian Somalilland,but also through Eritrea. The Ethiopians are known to desire to obtain Eritrea,most of whose inhabitants are closely related to those of Ethiopia. Moreover, at san Francisco and again recently at the Trusteeship Committee of the general assembly, the Ethiopian Delegation made a statement to the effect that it con-sidered &quot; that trusteeship agreements should in no case have the effect of con-firming territorial situations which, as a result of past aggressions, had deprivedany member of the United Nations of a portion of its territory.&quot; This wasno doubt intended to refer to Eritrea and possibly also to the Ogaden. Thereis no doubt that the most hopeful way of persuading the Ethiopians to agreeto the inclusion of the Ogaden and the Reserved Area in a unified Somalia willbe to support their claim for the possession of Eritrea or the greater part ofit. The circumstances of this part of Africa call, in fact, for a generalrationalisation of frontiers to bring them more into conformity with the naturalracial, cultural and economic groupings of the inhapitants.7. Other States, as well as the United Kingdom and Ethiopia will thusnecessarily be involved in any final settlement. Nevertheless, we have a particular interest in seeing the question solved and a particular reason for favouring early action. The latter arises from the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of 1944, whichis liable to expire on three months&apos; notice as from December 1946. Our presentoccupation of the Ogaden and Reserved Area derives from this Agreement. now that the war is over there are no grounds on which we could insist on a renewal,and it is most unlikely that the Ethiopian Government would agree to grant it.Once the Ogaden and Reserved Area had been returned to Ethiopian adminis-tration, it would be virtually impossible to detach them from Ethiopia to form part of a unified Somalia; yet without them, the unified Somalia project isunworkable.8. It is therefore to our interest to open the necessary negotiations withoutdelay. Apart from Italy herself, Ethiopia and the United Kingdom are the twoStates particularly concerned, and the presence of the Ethiopian Minister forForeign Affairs in London gives us an opportunity (which is unlikely to recur)of broaching the subject with the Ethiopians before launching the unified Somaliaproject with the Deputies of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Moreover, if we made no mention of the subject during his visit, but raised it within a month ortwo of his departure from London (either at the Council of Foreign ministers or with the Ethiopian Government direct) the Ethiopians might justly complainthat we had been keeping them in the dark, and this might very seriously
prejudice their attitude to the whole project. The question of creating a unifiedSomalia can be discussed with the Ethiopian Minister for Foreign Affairs without committing ourselves at this stage to putting British Somaliland under trustee-ship, or to the form which trusteeship for a unified Somaliland should take, andin advance of a final decision in 7-egard to the disposal of the Italian colonies.9. We therefore consider that the Ethiopian Minister for Foreign affairs should be sounded on the following lines. We could open by saying that amongthe frontier questions which His Majesty&apos;s Government would wish to see settledis that of the grazing grounds of the British Somali tribes which lie in the reserved Area and part of the Ogaden. We could go on to enlarge on the constant difficulties which have been caused by the existence of arbitrary inter-national frontiers cutting across the Somali territory (for example, the Wal Walincident of 1935, which was the starting-point of the Italian-Abyssinian war).Having stated our own essential requirement in this matter (the linking of the grazing grounds with British Somaliland), which it will in any case be essentialto put on record, we should then inform the Ethiopian Minister for ForeignAffairs that we have been giving consideration to a possible comprehensivesolution of the problem which we would like the Ethiopian Government toconsider. This solution would be the unification of all the Somali inhabitedcountries Italian, Ethiopian and British under one administration. We couldstate that such a solution would, in our view, be in the best interests of all theinhabitants, and that it might be advantageous to seek the views of the inhabi-tants on it. If the Ethiopian Minister for Foreign Affairs asked what form ofadministration we envisaged for this unified Somalia, we would say that we hadnot yet reached a final view on this point; it might be, however, that this area was one for which &quot;collective &quot; trusteeship (i.e., administration under trustee-ship by the United Nations Organisation itself) would be suitable. We would point out that in any case the creation of a unified Somalia was bound up withthe disposal of the Italian Colonies, in which other States as well as the UnitedKingdom and Ethiopia are concerned. It is, therefore, not in the power of either of us to take a final decision on the matter by ourselves. Nevertheless,His Majesty&apos;s Government for their part were considering putting this planforward in connexion with the disposal of the Italian Colonies, and if we knew that the Ethiopian Government were willing to consider it favourably, that wouldmake it much easier for His Majesty&apos;s Government in turn to support Ethiopianclaims in respect of Eritrea.10. If such an approach were being made to the Ethiopians it would bedesirable for us at the same time to let the United States Government know(perhaps informally) that we were doing so, in order to forestall a possibleEthiopian appeal to Washington which would aim at misrepresenting our inten-tions in the light of an attempt to &apos;&apos; annex &apos;&apos; part of the sovereign territory of ethiopia. We are, in any case, working closely with the Americans in the italian colonies discussions and this is an additional reason for keeping them informed.The success of the unified Somalia project will depend to a considerable extent on american support (which may not be easy to obtain), and it is important that itshould be presented to United States opinion in its true light, namely, as securingthe advantages of self-determination for the Somali people.11. The position should also be explained to the Dominion Governments.(Later, of course, in connexion with the comprehensive report referred to inparagraph 4 above, the Dominion Governments would have to be consulted onthe general question of the disposal of the Italian Colonies before final decisions are reached by the United Kingdom.)12.   To sum up, we therefore recommend (i) that an approach to the Ethiopian Minister for Foreign Affairs shouldbe made on the lines of paragraph 9 above;(ii) that the Americans should be informed of our action and of the reasonsfor it;(iii) that at the same time the position should be explained to the DominionGovernments.E.
