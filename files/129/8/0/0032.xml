(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;s government); IT?,CRETCJM46) 15229th March, 1946COPY NOCABINETINDIA1S RKCuIHKfrlENTS ON SEA PASSAGES FOR CIVILIANSMemorandum by the Parliamentary Under Secretary of.Statefor India__The gap between transport available and passagesrequired for civilians in India who urgently need to travel &apos;to this country has become increasingly serious andis now causing the Viceroy and myself, much concern,2.    When this matter was raised in the Defence Committeein September, 1945, (D.-0. (45) 6th Meeting, Item 2) it was accepted that up to the end of that year first prioritymust be given to the return of men in the Services, andthe hope was expressed that after the end of che year thesituation for civilians would be easier.    Meantime, itwould be necessary to impose a rigid system of prioritieson the movement of civilians.3c    Since that   date, worIcing on the basis of a rigidsystem of priorities, it has been possible to lift a steady flow of civilians In each month.      But the -accommodation available-has never been sufficient to liftall the people for whom passages were urgently required atany one time, and as a consequence there is a very formidabback log.     As indicated in the attached note it is essentito clear off 4,550 outstanding applications within the next two or three months and in addition to provide 1,500passages monthly for current needs.4.     I accordingly recommend the issue of a Directive tosecure that these passage requirements are treated ona basis of priority equivalent to that of service require-ftentSoAoHoia Office,29th March, 1946,

note the Viceroy states that, after the April allocationhas boon made, there will remain 4,b50 urgent casesunprovided for, of whom no fewer than 3,100 are women and children.     Of these latter, a large proportion arein the educational priority category.     The childrenhave places at schools at home and are of an age whenhealth suffers severely in India.     The Viceroy insiststhat the&apos;cases of these families must rank as urgent,both on account of pressing educational needs and because there is no longer suitable hot weather accommodation for all the families nowadays compelled to remain in India.Owing to the greatly increased cost of living, many ofthose compelled to remain on duty cannot afford tomaintain their families in a separate establishmentduring the hot weather in a suitable climate in a hillstation and other families, building on the expectation,that the civilian passage situation would be easier inthe early months of this year, have surrendered accommo-dation in the Hills and cannot now recover it.     the hard cases which have consequently arisen have progress-ively added to the wanting list;The numbers on the waiting list include, in alarge proportion, the families of official personnel.Many of these, in addition to the majority of the maleclaimants for passages, whether official or non-official,have spent as long as nine years in India without abreakc     Members of the British Armed Forces in india are, according to established policy, considered due forreposting to the United Kingdom after three and a thirdyears service in the East.     if the change to atemperate climate after three and a third years isconsidered by H.M. G. necessary for a trained, soldier,civilians, particularly women and children, who havehad to remain in India throughout the war have the strongest of claims to repatriation without delay.In normal times, civilians employed in India and their families would have spent in the United Eirigdom atleast one long leave every 4 - 5 years.The position lias been strongly represented by theViceroy, who himself has received pressing representa-tions from the European Association in India.Men and women are. tired and discouraged.     They havehad to face the anxieties of the 19^2 rebellion and ofrenewed outbreaks of violence, particularly in the la?gecities where the European population are mostly situated.The Viceroy now puts the matter beyond merelycompassionate considerations.     He notes that the morale of the Services is under severe test and thatthere is a widespread wish in the European community as a whole to have families removed from the scene of the prevailing unsettled conditions.     He considersthat a specially effective tonic to the Europeanelement in the administration would be the provisionQl more civilian passages.

The number of civilians in India is very smallbeside that of the Fighting Services.     It is impossibleto defend to them prolongation of a situation in whichthey are accorded such markedly less favourable treatment in regard to passages and the Viceroy urgesthe issue of a Directive which will now secure to themtreatment on equally favourable terms.     In additionto clearing off 4?55C civilians awaiting passage heestimates 1,500 civilian passages to be needed monthlyto achieve this essential requirement*
