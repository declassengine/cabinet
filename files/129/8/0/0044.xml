this DOCUMENT is the PROPERTY OF his BRITANNIC majesty*s GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  April 1946.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.CP. (46) 144.9th April, 1946.CABINET.PAYMENT    OF    RAILWAY    FARES    OF    PEERS    REGULARLYATTENDING SITTINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and leader of the House of Lords.I regret to have to bring before my colleagues a subject which may not be acceptable to them all but which I feel we cannot any longer avoid dealing with.By one device or another I have kept the subject back as long as ever I could, butthe growing insistence on the subject from Peers of all Parties in the House,coupled with the recent Report of the Select Committee on expenses of membersof the House of Commons (CP. (46) 123), makes it impossible to delay it any longer.2. My request is that, with suitable safeguards, Peers who are in regularattendance at the House, or on its appointed Committees, should receive theirbare out-of-pocket railway fare.3. It is necessary to refer briefly to the history of this application. InMay 1944, at the request of members from all sides, and after receiving an assurance from Lord Cranborne, then Leader, that if the House was desirous of adopting the motion it would receive favourable Government consideration, put a motion for discussion on the paper to the above effect. Rather to mysurprise, it was actively supported from all sides and it was urged that it wasnecessary for Peers who did their duty regularly, it being understood that therewas no element of salary or payment for services. At the end of the debate.Lord Cranborne made this statement :-&quot; I would suggest that I should bring this matter to the notice of myRt. Hon. Friend tlhe Chancellor of the Exchequer. I shall be very glad todo that, and I hope that it may receive a sympathetic response if and whenit is considered in another place.&quot;Subsequent to this, since my Labour colleagues in the Commons quite reasonablyfelt that it was a Government matter, it was left to the Chancellor of theExchequer; but, for one reason or another, notJhing was done about it.4. Since the General Election, I have received continual representations from Peers of all Parties, who diligently and sincerely do their duty, to theeffect that, in present circumstances, several men who desire to attend can onlydo so infrequently because of the expense and that, in common fairness, therailway fare is an expense which should properly be met.5. I told Lord Cranborne that I felt it was desirable that he himself shouldtake action in the matter and in January he placed a motion on the Order paper in the following terms :  &quot; To call the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the practicaldifficulties in which Peers are involved in the present circumstances inattending to their Parliamentary duties owing to the high cost of railwaytravel, and to move for papers.&quot;At the same time Lord Rosebery, on behalf of the Scottish Peers, placed a similarmotion on the paper.[31624]
6. I sounded the Chancellor of the Exchequer and found that he was not.at that time, sympathetically disposed, so that I persuaded both the Peersmentioned to defer action and, in response to my request, they have so far kepttheir Resolutions on the paper in the &quot;No Day Named &quot; section.7. The recent Report of the Committee dealing with expenses of membersof the House of Commons has meant that almost every day I am approached by Peers asking me to use my good offices on their behalf in this respect. Ihave discussed the matter carefully with my fellow Peers who are members ofthe Cabinet and they agree with me that, with suitable safeguards, it is a payment which, in common fairness, we ought to agree to. Personally, I thinkthat to do so would be politically wise.8. It is not very fair in matters of this kind to introduce a personal notebut I confess, in view of the action I myself was asked to take in May 1944in response to what I felt was a genuine case which would be sympatheticallymet, I have felt increasingly embarrassed.9. There is no doubt that in these days many Peers are of moderate meansand feel the expenses of attendance to be a real hardship. Whatever views wemay have as to the character and future of the House of Lords, the fact isthat it is part of the constitutional machinery, and I earnestly hope that mycolleagues will recognise the fact by making the small concession that I amasking for.. 10. I may say that the Officers of the House assure me that it will be perfectly feasible to adopt a scheme of safeguards which should be acceptable to the Treasury, and wihich would obviate payment of expenses to men who werenot acting bona fide but were seeking to take advantage of the concession. Thesuggestion underlying their scheme is that the permits would be limited to Peerswho make at least 25 per cent, of attendances.A.House of Lords, S.W.1,9th April, 1946.
