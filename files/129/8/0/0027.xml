My colleagues will recall that it is desired that the paper should be published at the latest on tuesday in time for the debate on Thursday.2.     An earlier draft was considered by the Meeting ofMinisters on World Food Supplies on 26th March.      Variouscriticisms were then made and the revised draft takes accountof these.      It has been prepared in great haste by officials in the Ministry of Food.      Unfortunately,  time did not permitor it being submitted to me before it was necessary to sendit to the printer.3.     My colleagues felt that the White paper should not include many statistical tables.      Accordingly,  only those on current consumption levels and on supplies of wheat inthe four main exporting countries have been retained.4.      With regard to the former my officials felt that the paragraphs on consumption levels in the introduction whichare a vital part of the paper would be scarcely intelligiblewithout a table.   .   They diu not consider it practicable togive in this table figures for individual countries exceptfor those which have already published figures known to beon a strictly comparable basis.      The figures for othercountries have been grouped in categories; in each categorythe nutritional level being roughly the same,  so that it willnot be possible for any of the countries concerned to take exception to the figures given.5.     The second table is purely factual and is important assetting out the fact that world wheat stocks will have fallenfrom a figure of 45*5 million tons at the enu of 1942/3 cropyear to 11.9 million tons at the end of 1945/6 crop year.6.      Paragraphs have been added at the beginning of part IIto bring out the differences between the problems facing theMinistry of Food now and those which it faced during the war.B.S.Ministry of Food, W.1.29TH MARCH,   1946.

THE WORLD FOOD SHORTAGEINTRODUCTION1. The aim of this paper is to set out the facts of the present crisis in the world&apos;s food supplies, to show how the crisis developed and to tracethe steps taken by the Government in the face of it.2. Long before the end of the war it had been foreseen that the shortages of fats, meat, dairy products and sugar, which had developed during the war,would remain acute for a considerable time after it was over. Towardsthe end of 1945, however, it became apparent that supplies of grain wouldalso be seriously inadequate and that it would no longer be possible tomake up for deficiencies in other foods by increased consumption of cereals.The food problem was no longer one of austerity but of absolute shortage.The cause of this critical situation was an exceptional succession of droughtsin many of the world&apos;s main producing areas during the current harvest year,coming on the top of the already serious dislocation of the world&apos;s agriculturaleconomy and trade due to six years of war.3. The extent of the dislocation can be measured by the following figures. Production of bread grains (wheat and rye) in Continental Europe,excluding TJ.S.S.R., during last autumn amounted to only 31 million tons,compared with 46 million tons a year earlier and a pre-war average of59 million tons. There was a proportionately heavy fall in the production of meat and other livestock foods. As a consequence, stated import require-ments for the continent of Europe for the year July 1945 to June 1946amount to 15-6 million tons of bread grains as compared with a pre-warimport of 3 - 7 million tons. Even if these quantities could be obtained, total supplies in Europe would be about 25 per cent, less than during an averagepre-war year. The other deficit countries (India, China, French North Africa,South Africa and certain others) present a similar picture, stated import requirements for 1945-46 amounting to 10-7 million tons compared with a pre- -war import of 2-4 million tons. In the East the gravity of thesituation has been aggravated by an equally serious fall in the productionof rice in the territories occupied by Japan. In the two. principal rice-exporting countries, Burma and. Siam, production in 1946 is estimated at only 4-9 million tons against a pre-war average of 8-4 million tons. Therehas also been a drastic decline in the Far Eastern production of vegetableoils and sugar to a point where imports for relief are required in some countries though before the war the Far East exported substantial quantities to Europe and America.4. Besides the actual devastation of war which was particularlydamaging during the autumn and spring of 1944-45, a number of causeshave contributed to this catastrophic decline in production. The world&apos;stransport system has been wrenched to the purposes of war so that fuel,fertilisers and feeding-stuffs for animals have not found their way to their most productive channels. Thus in Australia and the Argentine the acreageand production of grain for export declined during the war years, largely because there was not sufficient shipping for bulk cargoes. In the Argentinestocks of grain and linseed have been burned for fuel owing to lack of coal and oil. In many countries economic conditions have been unsettled and the consequent lack of faith in the currency, joined in some cases to a scarcity of goods on which money could be spent, has made producers unwilling tosell for cash.   In the former war-zones it has been difficult to re-establish
effective machinery for collecting produce from farmers with the result thatthe farm populations have tended to maintain their feeding standards, thus&apos;limiting supplies to the town-dwellers.5. The large accumulation of stocks of wheat in exporting countries,which at mid-1943 reached a peak of over 45 million tons, compared with a pre- -war average of about 11 million tons, obscured for a time the gravity ofthe position and made producers hesitant to return in full to pre-war acreages.Nor was it possible in the early stages of liberation to estimate with anyaccuracy the full extent of the decline in the agricultural productivity of^bntinental areas.6. The culminating factor in the situation, and the least calculable inits effects, has been the series of droughts. It must be realised that the fulleffects of drought cannot be estimated till a considerable time after the event.The most severe of these droughts have been (1) in Europe, particularly theMediterranean area, during the summer of 1945, seriously affecting the grainand potato harvests; (2) in French North Africa during the spring of 1945,reducing crops of bread grains from the normal figure of 3-8 million tons to 1 -1 million tons; (3) in the Union of South Africa, over a protracted periodreducing grain production from 0-5 million tons to 0-3 million tons; (4) in new Zealand during late 1945 and early .1946, seriously affecting butterproduction; and finally (5) in India, where the general failure of the rainsnormally expected from December to March has reduced grain crops bysome 7 million tons. This Indian calamity, which is still in progress, hasby its timing and by its extent been the crucial factor in the crisis.7. Against these heavy losses in world supplies can be set an increasein food production in the United Kingdom, in the Middle East and in north America. The increase achieved in Britain, though invaluable toour war effort, was inevitably small in relation to world totals and still leavesus dependent on imports for more than half our food and vulnerable to any reduction in wcrld supjdies. In North America the potentialities wereobviously much greater and an impressive expansion has in fact been achieved,aided by a succession of good crops. Thus in the United States alone foodproduction in 1945 had increased by 25 per cent, over the 1935/39 average.But although generous assistance has been given by the North american countries, by no means all the increased production is available for the relief of shortages elsewhere. The greater part has been absorbed by the largefood requirements of the armed forces and by the extent to which full employment and high wages have enabled low income groups in producing countries to improve their standards of consumption in spite of rationing.8. Among the first commodities in which world shortages developed weremeat and other livestock products; in Europe because of a heavy fall in production and in North America because mounting military and civiliandemands more than outweighed the increase in output. At the time (early1945) large supplies of cereals were available in exporting countries and therewas a natural tendency to increase the output of livestock products. Inmany European countries, plans which now appear premature were madeto build up the greatly depleted livestock population. Coarse grains such asbarley which had been used extensively for human food were again fed tolivestock, and in some countries a certain amount of wheat as well. extraction-tion rates of flour from wheat were lowered, partly to provide more millingoffals for animal feeding. Both changes increased Europe&apos;s dependence on imported wheat for human food. At the same time the maintenance of the greatly expanded livestock population in North America, where controlledprices tended to favour meat production, put a heavy strain on suppliesof feeding-stuffs for animals. In spite of the unsatisfied demand for[31508] o*
animal foods it is evident that at present the world&apos;s livestock population is too high in relation to available grain supplies, having regard to the needsof deficit countries for grain for human food. It is well known that under conditions of scarcity, the most economic use of grain is for feeding human beings direct and not for converting it through animals into meat and eggsfor human food. Under normal feeding practices, for example, it needs3  lbs. of grain and concentrated feeding-stuffs to produce 1 lb. of beef,5  lbs. to produce 1 lb. of eggs and 6 to 7i lbs. to produce 1 lb. of pig meat.Current Consumption Levels A9. Approximate consumption levels at the beginning of 1946 in a numberof representative countries are given in Table 1 in terms of calories per head. The figures for the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and australia are based on the official &quot; Consumption Level Enquiry &quot; and show supplies moving into civilian consumption measured at the retail level;actual intakes are lower owing to wastage in cooking, preparation, &amp;c.For European countries the figures are unofficial and somewhat roughestimates of the position at the beginning of 1946 made on as nearly aspossible a comparable basis. Statistical information is inadequate tojustify similar estimates for India and other Eastern countries. The figures show only the caloric value of the food supplies and take no account of thefall in the quality of the diet which has been general in European countries.For example, in the United Kingdom about 45 per cent, of the total calorieintake now comes from grain foods and potatoes, against only 34 per cent,before the war. Similar changes have taken place in all countries in continental Europe. Diets with a high dependence on grain and potatoes arenot only plainer and less palatable, but are likely also to be deficient in themore valuable protective foods.Table 1.

10. In considering the figures in Table 1, it should be borne in mind thatin many countries further reductions will become inevitable as the full impact of the grain shortage is felt. It should be emphasised, too, that the figures shown are averages and that many people, especially in towns, receive much less than the average because in general the farming population are able tomaintain consumption levels above the average and even sometimes at present -war rates. An attempt has been made to estimate separately supplies available to urban consumers, but these estimates, too, are averages andconceal the effect of differential rationing and varying availability ofyj^itioned supplies. For example, in nearly all countries in ContinentalEurope bread and potatoes are rationed and additional rations must thereforebe provided for miners and other heavy workers, who would otherwise be incapable of sustained exertion. When allowance is made for the consumptionof these special groups, it is certain that many individuals who have nopriority for rations and little access to unrationed or black market foods, arcalready approaching starvation levels. Thus in the British Zone &quot; normalconsumers,&apos;&apos; who make up about half the population, receive rations providingabout 1,000 calories, but the average for the whole non-farm population isestimated at about 1,200 calories when allowance is made for the additional supplies going to heavy workers and for small quantities of vegetables andother unrationed foods. It should be remembered, too, that in relatively few countries are rations of basic foods honoured as unfailingly as in theUnited Kingdom. In India, in many areas in the Far East, and in someother areas many among the peasant populations as well as town-dwellersare reduced to starvation levels owing to crop failures.11. As the calorie level falls there is a rapid fall in the capacity for workand an increase in deaths from the indirect and direct effects of under-nourishment. In spite of recent experience it is difficult to give any preciseindication of the calorie level at which famine conditions may be expected,much depends on the initial nutritional status of the population, the duration of the period of under-nourishment and other variables.12. The experience of those who dealt with the grave famine situationin the Western Netherlands last winter provides clear evidence that there israpid deterioration of physical condition, loss of weight and the appearance ofdiseases of mal-nutrition among people forced to subsist on calorie levels below,000 a day. When, later in the period of deprivation, the rations were cutfurther until they provided no more than five or six hundred calories, indi-viduals were reduced to living skeletons within a month or two unless theywere fortunate enough to be able to get supplies of unrationed foods. Hungeroedema is an inevitable accompaniment of subsistence for more than a week or two at these low calorie levels.13. The Emergency Economic Committee for Europe have recently pub-lished estimates of consumption levels (mainly urban) in certain european countries which are generally in line with those now presented thoughprepared on a somewhat different basis, together with estimates of thenumbers in critical danger of famine conditions.Outlook for 1946/4714. It should be emphasised that the present difficulties are unlikely to disappear with the next harvest. Some increase in production may beexpected in the former war zones, and a repetition of this season&apos;s disastrousdroughts .is improbable, but against this exportable supplies will fall,heavily with the virtual exhaustion this season of stocks accumulatedduring the war.[31508] 0* 2
15. For example, a recovery in the European production of breadgrains in 1946 to the 1944 level would represent an increase of about15 million tons, though this may be an optimistic assumption. This wouldnot result in a corresponding reduction in import requirements, sinceconsumption cannot be held indefinitely at its present extremely low level,though requirements might be roughly halved to say 8 million tons. Afurther saving of about 2 million tons would follow from normal crops inSouth Africa and French North Africa, but this would be largely offset by increased requirements for India which will reach their peak in the second half of 1946. On these assumptions, therefore, the total reduction^ in import requirements would be less than the 10 million tons which thisseason has been drawn from stocks in exporting countries. Next season&apos;sexports will come almost entirely from current production, and it follows that unless crops in exporting countries as a whole at least reach thefairly high level of 1945 there can be no improvement in the position. one new factor which might afford considerable relief, however, would be goodcrops and a large exportable surplus in the U.S.S.R. No precise estimate ofthe supply position in 1946-47 is yet possible as too much depends on weather conditions and other unpredictable factors. But it is already clear that onlya combination of favourable circumstances can bring about any material improvement, while unfavourable crops would spell disaster.The Situation in India16. The population of India is increasing at the rate of over 5 millions ayear and the development of food production is not keeping pace with this increase. India is a country of subsistence farmers producing mainly fortheir own consumption. Seventy per cent, of her population of some410 millions are directly dependent on agriculture. Only the small surplusesof the millions of cultivators reach the market; and it is to these surpluses(plus imports) that the authorities must look to feed the cities and deficitareas. In times when crops are short, or (as has happened throughout thewar) prices are high and cultivators consequently have to sell less in orderto meet their other requirements and can consume more of their ownfoodgrains, the procurement of food grains for the market becomes moredifficult and the necessity for imports becomes greater.17. India is normally a deficit country in food-grains. Before the warshe imported an average of about li million tons of rice a year from Burma.These supplies were cut off by the Japanese conquest of Burma in 1942, andthe sequel was the Bengal famine of 1943. Since that famine the authoritiesin India have extended the acreage under food crops, improved and extendedthe system of Government monopoly procurement of food-grains, established a system of planned movements of supplies from surplus to deficit areas,imported as much wheat from abroad as the shipping situation permitted,and introduced rationing for the larger cities and many of the smaller ones.During 1943-44 and 1944-45 India was fortunate in having good harvestsboth of wheat and rice. But supplies have never been sufficient to enablethe authorities to build up working stocks, without which it is difficult toprevent local shortages, secure even distribution over the country, maintainconfidence and stimulate the maximum procurement of indigenous food crops.It has always been foreseen that without a reserve of stocks a failure of the rains would at once produce a most critical situation.18. In the late summer of 1945 it was feared that the Bengal rice crop,due to be harvested in December-January, might fail, but this was savedby rains in October. Unfortunately a cyclone, a tidal wave and droughtselsewhere in the autumn and, in particular, a general failure of the rains clue
PART I.-THE PRESENT SITUATION IN RESPECT OF WORLDAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND FOOD SUPPLIESBread Grains19. The wheat supply position in the main exporting countries is shownin some detail in Table 2 from the immediate pre-war years to date.Although aggregate acreages in the four countries shrank from about 130 to100 million acres, a succession of good crops in North America resulted in a rapid increase in stocks of wheat during the eax*ly years of the war, and atthe 1943 harvest the combined carry-over from earlier crops reached thehigh level of 45-5 million tons, against an average carry-over of 12 million tons in 1935-39. Even at that time, however, the need to maintain heavystocks against post-war needs was appreciated (in particular, attention was drawn to the inherent dangers of the position by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the London Food Council) and steps were taken to restore wheatacreages in North America and Australia.20. Although the target acreages were generally achieved and in spiteof a continued series of good crops in North America as a whole, stocksbegan to decline in 1944 and 1945, mainly owing to the greatly increaseduse of wheat for animal feeding. This was especially marked in theUnited States where the rapid growth in the livestock population outransupplies of feeding grains. There was also a heavy usage of wheat for industrial purposes, mainly the production of alcohol for the manufactureof synthetic rubber. By the 1945 harvest the carryover in exporting countries had declined to 22 million tons. Allowing for the maximum practicable reductions in stocks(1) and for some reduction in animal feeding,exportable supplies in the 1945-46 season are estimated at 23-7 million tons, about twice the average pre-war export. Wheat exports have, in fact,moved at this rate throughout the winter. In addition, it is estimated that exports of coarse grains for human consumption will amount to 1-4 million tons in the first half of 1946 and that about 0-4 million tons of wheat willbe exported from the U.S.S.R.21. Even these supplies, however, fall seriously short of import require-ments. European requirements alone are estimated at over 15 - 6 million tons(against a pre-war import of less than 4 million tons) while additional needsarising largely from the crop failures in India, South Africa and French north africa and from the need to provide wheat to offset deficiencies of rice inFar Eastern countries bring total world import requirements to about 32million tons. On present estimates the world deficit of wheat is thus about million tons for the crop year 1945-46 and this is making itself felt inthe first half of 1946.(&apos;) One limiting factor is the transportation of North American grain from inlandareas to the sea-board, particularly during the winter months when the Great Lakesare frozen. Transportation difficulties also arise in the Argentine and to a more limited extent in Australia.from December-January onwards over much of Southern, Western andNorthern India have resulted in a drop of 3 million tons below expectationin rice and millet crops due to be harvested in the winter of 1945-46 and,on top of this, in a very large deficit of the order of 4-4 A- million tons inthe expected crops of wheat, barley and gram to be harvested this spring.It is the disastrous failure of the winter rains which has caused the Govern-ment of India to increase their estimate of India&apos;s import requirements ofcereals (wheat or rice) in 1946 from 1A million tons to over 4 million tons.

-    16522. In Europe the area of bread grains (wheat and rye) sown in 1945-46was about 23 per cent, below the pre-war average, mainly because ofdisorganisation arising from war conditions at seeding time. Yields toowere about 25 per cent, below normal, owing to drought in SouthernEurope and a general shortage of fertilisers and inadequacy of cultivation.Though no wholly reliable estimate is possible, total production probablyamounted to about 31 million tons, about 15 million tons less than theprevious crop and 28 million tons (47 per cent.) below the pre-war average.Since seed must be provided for an increased acreage in 1946, the fall in netApplies for human consumption is proportionately heavier.23. In other areas the falls in production below normal pre-war levelsare of comparable severity, amounting to about 25 per cent, in India, 40 percent, in South Africa and 70 per cent, in French North Africa. In Indiaand South Africa these losses only became apparent at the end of 1945, andtheir effect is all the more serious because of a parallel decline in theproduction of rice in India and of maize (the staple cereal of the native population) in South Africa. The total fall in production of bread grains inthe three countries amounts to about 5 million tons and this results almostentirely from drought since crop areas have not fallen. 024. As already noted, no early solution of the wheat shortage can beexpected. Although some recovery in Europe is likely next season and a repetition of the severe droughts of 1945/46 is improbable, it must boremembered that nearly half the exportable supply in 1945/46 representedstocks accumulated in exporting countries during the war years; these arenow down to the pre-war level.Rice. 25. The shortage of rice is as acute as the shortage of wheat and supplies are entirely inadequate to meet the needs of Eastern countries where rice is the staple food. Production fell drastically under japanese occupation : thus in the three leading rice-exporting countries, Burma, Siamand French Indo-China, which before the war exported nearly 6 million tons annually, the crops now being harvested will barely suffice for domestic consumption. Although it is hoped to secure exports of 14 million tons in1946, these will come entirely from stocks which have accumulated in Siamand to a less extent in Burma. Exports from Korea and Formosa mayreach 0-2 million tons against a pre-war average of 1-7 million tons.26. There have also been heavy losses in importing countries. Accordingto United States estimates, production has fallen in China by million tons(17 per cent.) and in Japan by 2J million tons (20 per cent.) below the pre-waraverage, while the Philippine Islands formerly almost self-supporting nowshow a deficit of 0-5 million tons. In India efforts were made to expandproduction during the war to offset the loss of imports from Burma: the acreage was increased by 10 per cent, and in 1943 and 1944 crops of 31 and28 million tons were harvested, compared with a pre-war average of 26 million tons. This year&apos;s crop, however, is unlikely to exceed 25 million tons owingto bad weather. All figures for India exclude the &quot; non-reporting &quot; ares which probably produce a further 2-3 million tons.27. Total export supplies for the current year 1946 are estimated at only -4 million tons, against, stated import requirements of 5-5 million tons,though these in themselves appear small in i*elation to pre-war supplies.Shipments to areas where rice is not the staple cereal are being eliminatedas far as possible, but there remains a deficit of about 3 million tons. Itmay be added that great difficulties are being experienced in procuring riceexports.  To combat this efforts are being made to improve port facilities, and
special shipments of consumer goods are being sent to Burma and Siam inorder to overcome producers&apos; reluctance to sell, but it is by no means certainthat the export targets will be reached.28. The special problems of Far Eastern countries must be borne inmind. Even before the war food supplies in many rice-consuming countries were marginal and there was less room for belt-tightening than in someWestern countries: the effect of a reduction in supplies is therefore allthe more serious. Further, rice is almost entirely grown by peasantcultivators, and supplies for deficit areas and export represent the accumula*tion of tiny surpluses from millions of small holdings. A small increasein prosperity (which has in fact occurred during the war in parts of India)may increase the rice consumption of peasant families and severely restrictsupplies for sale. The threat of food shortage and the lack of consumer goods have also increased the producers&apos; reluctance to sell. All these factors add greatly to the gravity of the position.29. Future prospects for rice are by no means encouraging. Duringthe war, much rice land in Burma, Siam and elsewhere has reverted tojungle and cannot at once be brought back into production, while in many areas the irrigation system has been destroyed. It is estimated that fouryears may elapse before production in Burma is restored to normal. More-over, next year stocks in Siam and Burma will have been almost exhausted.Every effort is being made to expand production in all suitable areas, includingColonial territories, but it will be impossible to restore world production to normal levels in one season.Livestock Numbers and Supplies of Feeding-stuffs30. Changes in livestock numbers have been very marked during the war years. In the United Kingdom, where imports of feeding-stuffs were heavilycurtailed in order to save shipping, there was a planned reduction in numbersof pigs, poultry and sheep, and still more in the feeding of grain to suchlivestock, in order to maintain supplies to the dairy herd and thus avoid anyserious fall in the milk output. This was done both for reasons of humannutrition and because milk production is the most economical use of feeding-stuffs. In Europe, too, there has been a heavy fall in numbers of pigs and poultry, and to a smaller extent of cattle and horses. Heavy reductions wereinevitable in view of the shortage of feeding-stuffs, but they resulted to aconsiderable extent from the inroads of invading armies and the requisitioning of meat and livestock for Germany during the occupation, and in many countries were therefore largely unplanned.31. Outside Europe the trend was in the opposite direction. Livestocknumbers increased sharply in the United States and Canada in response togrowing demands for meat and dairy products both for civilian and militaryconsumption and for lend-lease and other exports. In North America asa whole pig numbers have increased by 40 per cent., poultry by 33 per cent,and cattle by 20 per cent, since 1935-39. In the Southern Hemispherecountries livestock numbers were more stable, but here, too, the trend wasupward.32. These changes are important, not only because of their bearing onmeat supplied, but still more because of their effect on the quantities ofcereals foods available for human consumption. For example, officialUnited States estimates show that as a result of the increased livestockpopulation the quantity of grain used for feeding-stuffs in the United states has increased by about 40 per cent, since 1935-39.   In North America as a
whole it is estimated that about 114 million tons of grain will be fed to live-stock in 1945-46, including about 9 million tons of wheat. The quantitiesof grain fed to livestock in Europe and the United Kingdom have had to besharply reduced and now probably total about one-quarter of the quantitiesused in North America, for only slightly fewer animals.33. Grain used for animal feeding is the only remaining reservoir fromwhich further substantial quantities for human consumption are available,though it could be tapped only at the expense of some loss of meat and otherlivestock products. In Europe savings could only be effected by a further^lighter of livestock, since feeding rates arc already low and to reduce themfurther would be wholly uneconomic.Meat34. The pre-war international trade in meat was mainly a movement from the Southern Dominions and the Argentine to the United Kingdom.Although there were movements of meat and livestock within Europe and considerable trade in bacon to the United Kingdom, the Continent was on balance self sufficient. But the meat production of the Western Europecountries, as also of the United Kingdom, was based to a considerable extent on imported fodder grains and oilcake. With the loss of overseas suppliesof fodder and with the diversion of home-produced cereals to food users andof pasture land to food production there has been a drastic decline in Europeanmeat production, which has been accentuated by losses in the final phase of the war.35. The United States and Canada, on the other hand, stimulated produc-tion to meet the heavy demands of the Services and of their Allies. Meatproduction has now declined somewhat from the peak reached in 1943-44but is still more than 40 per cent, above the 1935-39 average. Some expan-sion also occurred in South America, but in the Southern Dominions the initial shortage of shipping during the war years was sufficient reason toprevent any increase in jn-oduction.36. Average civilian consumption of meat (including bacon) in the UnitedKingdom is now estimated at about 100 lb. per head per year, as against132 lb. before the war. In the United States and Canada civilian consump-tion, which before the war averaged about the same as in the United Kingdom,is estimated at about 140 lb. per head in 1945. In the United States,where rationing has been abandoned, it is estimated by the United StatesGovernment as likely to be at the rate of about 160 lb. per head (includingoffal) in 1946. Consumption in Australia was estimated at about 200 lb.per head in 1945, against a pre-war average of 248 lb. In Denmark meatconsumption is about the same as in United Kingdom, but in most european countries it is considerably lower. In Western Europe it is about three-quarters of the United Kingdom level, and in Central Europe, South andSouth-East Europe less than one-third. To a large extent these differenceswere already evident before the war.37. Future supplies of meat will depend mainly on the size of this year&apos;sgrain harvest. Should this fail there will be increased need to limit theamount of grain fed to livestock in all countries. Some immediate reductionin meat output now seems inevitable in view of the current shortage ofwheat for human food. This may take the form of postponement of recovery of livestock in Europe, including the United Kingdom, and a downward trend in production in the United States and Canada. There is little hope ofsubstantially increased production in South America or the southern dominions to offset this decline so that world supplies may be expected tocontinue short of world requirements.
Oils and Fats38. The oils and fats situation has been difficult during the war yearsbecause of the loss of export supplies of oilseeds and vegetable oils fromthe Far East and the suspension of whale fishing. Before the war aboutIf million tons (in terms of oil) were imported into Europe and America fromManchuria, the Netherlands East Indies, the Philippine Islands and Malaya.Although these countries are no longer under Japanese occupation it is not expected that more than 250-300 thousand tons will be exported in 1946owing to reduced production, difficulties of collection, increased local consume.-,tion and the political situation in the Nethei-lands East Indies. There ha&quot;jalso been losses in supplies of vegetable oils from India where the criticalcereals situation is seriously limiting exports. Exports from tropical Africadeclined during the war. In Europe there has been a heavy fall in productionof animal fats, only partly offset by increased production of vegetable oils.Whaling, which provided a substantial proportion of this country&apos;s pre-warsupply of fats, was stopped during the war and the current season&apos;s production has unfortunately been interrupted by severe weather.39. Against these losses can be set only one substantial gain : the rapidlyincreased production in the United States of vegetable oils and lard whichhas changed that country from a large importer to a small-scale netexporter. An increase has also been achieved in Canada, mainly inlinseed oil and animal fats. In the Argentine increased acreages have beensown to oilseed crops, particularly sunflower seed, and despite increaseddomestic utilisation (including in the war years the burning of oil as fuel)the current estimate of exportable supply is over 100 thousand tons oilequivalent above the pre-war average.40. World exports in 1946 will be little more than half the pre-war leveland total supplies in importing countries are estimated to be about 80per cent, of normal. Allocations of available supplies were agreed towardsthe end of 1945 by the Combined Food Board and are now under review-in the light of more complete information, but allocations are only possible on the basis of substantially reduced consumption. No substantial improve-ment in the supply position is possible until Far Eastern exports are once more available on something approaching the pre-war scale.41. United Kingdom requirements of oils and fats have increased duringthe war because of the heavy fall in imports of butter which have been jDartlyreplaced by margarine. Civilian consumption of edible fats, including butter,in the United Kingdom is now at the rate of about 35 lb. per head (in termsof fat content) or about 75 per cent, of the 1934/38 average; while theconsumption of all fats and oils, including those used for soap, paint andother technical purposes, is about 61 lb. per head, about 90 per cent, of the1934/38 level. There has been a parallel restriction of consumption in north america where it is now only slightly greater than in the United Kingdom.In Continental Europe it is lower, particularly in South and South-east europe, where consumption has declined to little more than half the lowrpre-war level, and in Germany and Austria where the fall has been evensteeper. In these countries supplies per head are estimated at about one quarter of those now available in the United Kingdom.Sugar42. Before the war the main sugar importing countries were the UnitedKingdom and the United States, with annual net imports of about 2 million tons and 4 million tons respectively (refined values). Continental Europeboth imported and exported sugar and on balance was a net importer of
18 -    167about J million tons annually. Sources of supply lost during the warincluded Java and the Philippine Islands, each with an annual export ofabout 1 million tons. There was also some fall in production in other sugarproducing areas, including the British Caribbean Islands, where, owing tothe shortage of shipping, land under sugar had to be diverted to other foodcrops for local consumption. In spite of civilian rationing in the mainimporting countries, world requirements remained high owing to largemilitary needs, and a heavy usage of sugar for industrial alcohol. Theyivere met in 1944 and 1945 only by drawing on accumulated stocks to theRxtent of 1J million tons.43. In the current year there are no remaining reserves from accumulated stocks (except an unknown quantity in Java at present unavailable)and no imports are expected from the areas formerly under japanese occupation. Production in the Caribbean, however, shows some improve-ment over 1945 and total exportable supplies from all areas are expectedto be about the same as last year. Increased import requirements arise in Continental Europe, where production from the last crop is estimated tobe 50 per cent, below the normal level. This results from a fall of nearly30 per cent, in the sugar beet acreage, and from shortages of fertilisers,labour for harvesting and coal for refining. No agreement has yet beenfinalised for the allocation of available supplies for the whole of 1946 andat the moment shipments are being made on the basis of short-termagreements. Current civilian consumption is about 30 per cent, below thepre-war level in the United Kingdom and North America, and still lower inmost European countries.44. The outlook for the future is more favourable, and 1946 may well prove to be the low point for sugar supplies. An increase in Europeanproduction may be assumed with the next harvest at the end of 1946, andthere is also a possibility that some exports, even if small, may become available from the Far East in the course of 1947. Requirements, however,are likely to grow.PART II.-MEASURES TAKEN BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO MEET THE CRISIS45. The end of the war has brought about a fundamental change in theposition of the United Kingdom in relation to the world food situation.During the war the problem was two-fold; first, to cut down imported supplies to a minimum, primarily in order to save shipping; and second,to maintain a regular flow of these minimum supplies in the face of allthe dislocations of war. Broadly speaking, the supplies were there ready tobe drawn upon. The United Kingdom was a bastion occupied by greatAllied armies into which the nations for whom those armies were fightingwere eager to pour supplies in order to maintain the fight.46. With the end of the war the United Kingdom ceased to occupythat privileged, though perilous, position; its claims upon United Nationssupplies were now shared by vast liberated areas, some of them parts ofits own Empire. The wide extension of claimants coincided with a sharpfall in world supplies, due partly to the ravages and claims of war and partly to an exceptional succession of droughts. Moreover, currency problems,which had ceased to be of overriding inmortance during the period of lend/Lease, again became urgent and our food imports had once more tobe measured carefully in relation to balance of payment and dollar holdings.
47. Thus instead of the war-time task of keeping open the lines ofcommunication&apos; and securing a fair distribution of deliberately restrictedsupplies, the Government now has the more delicate and complicated task,under conditions of rapidly increasing shortage, of maintaining the basicstandard of feeding in this country and endeavouring to relieve some of itsmonotony and at the same time of carrying out responsibilities to theworld as a whole.48. For example, the Government has now the responsibility of ensuring a minimum diet for a vast population in the Liberated Areas of the FarAEast and in&quot; India, now threatened with famine. This has meant that theGovernment has become deeply involved in the procurement and distributionof rice from Siam and other rice-producing countries^ The British army of Occupation is responsible for a highly industralised zone of Germany,always heavily dependent on imported food, whose products, particularlycoal, are vital for the reconstruction of Europe. An adequate provision offood for this zone continues to be one of the most pressing problems withwhich the Government is faced. Furthermore, it is in the long-term interests of the United Kingdom, as of the world, that there should not be,as there was after the last war, a world inflation of  trices. This has meantthe continuation of a system for distributing exportable supplies on an agreed basis, an arrangement which entails a delicate balance of give and take.49. These added difficulties and responsibilities have been taken on ata time when the inhabitants of the United Kingdom were naturally looking forward to better conditions as the fruits of victory, and when the sacrificesnecessary to win the battle of peace call for greater qualities of restraint and imagination than are needed under the more obvious imperatives of war.50. The following paragraphs set out the special measures which havebeen adopted to meet the present crisis as it has developed during recent months. These measures have been conditioned by the fact that the UnitedKingdom is a large net importer of food. It follows that the extent to whichthe Government could or can by direct action avert or ameliorate shortages of food in the world is strictly limited and must be largely confined to measures for securing the best possible use of land in the United Kingdom,of the products of the land, and of all imported food and animal feeding-stuffs. The maintenance of various wartime controls, irksome thoughmany of them are, has enabled the Government to keep down to a minimum the dependence of the United Kingdom on imported supplies. The Govern-ment has also played an active part, in co-operation with the food-exporting countries, in securing the direction and movement of available supplies tothe areas where they were urgently required.A. Wheat51. While the present acute crisis in world wheat supplies has assumedits most serious proportions since the harvest of 1945, stocks have been falling since the summer of 1943. At that time stocks in the four mainexporting countries stood at the high level of over 45 million tons, four times as much as the average &quot; carry over&quot; of the immediate pre-war years. a fall in those stocks could be faced with equanimity. Indeed the problem of1943 and 1944 was a problem of transporting supplies to consumingcountries, not of any shortage in the supply itself. Stocks, however, began to disappear rapidly. This was due to the increasing demand for livestock products for export (resulting in heavy feeding of wheat to animals, especially
in North America), to the increased use of wheat for industrial purposes inthe United States (mainly for the production of industrial alcohol, which isone of the raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic rubber), and tothe use of wheat as fuel in the Argentine. In consequence the level of total stocks had fallen by the end of June 1944 to 31-1 million tons and by theend of June 1945 to 22-4 million tons.52. An assessment made in July 1945 of the world wheat and flourposition up to the end of 1946 indicated that there would be a shortage ofkvvheat against requirements for the period July 1945-June 1946, but that the^ap could probably be closed by securing:  (a) a reduction in the amount of wheat fed to animals;(b) the agreement of the four main exporting countries to reduce their stocks at the end of the period to levels consistent with theminimum end-of-season stocks specified in the draft international wheat Agreement.53. Arrangements were made for the Canadian, United States and united Kingdom representatives to sound a note of warning at the meetingof the U.N.E.R.A. Council on the 7th August, 1945, in Washington.54. On the 4th September, 1945, a press notice on the wheat position was issued by the International Wheat Council following their meetings inLondon during August. This notice was issued largely at the instance ofthe United Kingdom representative. It stated that, after reviewing thepresent and prospective world wheat position, the Council concluded that present estimates of import requirements substantially exceeded theestimated available supplies, but that, if the feeding of wheat to livestockwas rigidly controlled and wartime flour extraction rates were maintained,there should be enough wheat to go round. The Council recommended toits members that they should take all steps necessary to ensure that themaximum quantity of wheat was made available for human consumption.55. On the 12th October, 1945, His Majesty&apos;s Government conveyedthe following recommendations to the Governments of the four mainexporting countries:  (a) To set aside at the 30th June, 1946, no more wheat than was con-sistent with the minimum end-of-season carry-over set out in theInternational Wheat Agreement.(b) To restrict the use of wheat for animal feeding to the extent neces-sary to meet essential world requirements for direct human consumption.(c) To grant the necessary facilities to secure as a matter of utmosturgency the maximum movement of wheat to seaboard.(d) To enter into no commitments with importing countries indepen-dently of the Combined Food Board.The replies received from the four main exporting countries indicatedtheir general acceptance of these recommendations and their readiness toact upon them in so far as was administratively practicable.56. His Majesty&apos;s Government also drew the attention of the EmergencyEconomic Committee for Europe to the serious world wheat position andto the fact that importing countries could not rely on securing the fullquantity of their stated requirements of imported wheat. This committee at its meeting on 1st November, 1945, invited the Combined Food board to support the recommendations made by His Majesty&apos;s Government to
the Governments of the four main exporting countries set out above. Itfurther recommended:  (a) that importing countries should (i) take all practicable steps to secure that millable wheat was used only for human food;(ii) take steps to secure that, unless technical difficulties made itimpossible, the flour extraction rate should not be reduced below 85 per cent., or where it was below that level that itshould be raised to it; /&quot;)(iii) make use as far as possible of substitute cereals and flourdiluents such as barley, oats, soya;(6) that all countries should be urged to aim at the maximum productionof bread grains for the 1946 harvest;(c) that member Governments be requested to review the action open tothem to assist in bridging the gap between wheat supplies and requirements.57. In mid-December 1945 a further review of the position for the period july 1945-June 1946 was carried out. The conclusions reached were thatrequirements for the last half of 1945 would, be substantially met but thatthere would now probably be a deficit of about 5i million tons in suppliesagainst requirements for the first half of 1946.58. In view of this serious situation, the Minister of Food visited Wash-ington at the beginning of January in order to discuss the whole questionof cereal supplies with the United States Government. He expressed theGovernments apprehensions to the Secretary for Agriculture and to thePresident. It was clear that the requirements of all importing countries andthe prospects for increasing supplies from the exporting countries would haveto be reviewed internationally and it was decided to establish immediatelya Committee of the four main exporting countries, which would determineshipment programmes after the whole problem had been considered by the cereals Committee of the Combined Food Board, in the light of the discus-sions which the Minister of Food held with members of the United states administration.59. Since the Minister of Food&apos;s return from Washington in January,the position has deteriorated still further. The available supplies are expectedto fall appreciably short of previous estimates and although some countries have found it possible to reduce their requirements, these reductions are more than offset by the substantially increased requirements which have since been notified by other countries (e.g., India, South Africa) and byrequests for wheat to make up the expected shortage of rice.60. As soon as it became clear that world supplies would not be likelyto equal the demand, steps were taken in this country to effect economies in the consumption of grain and to secure the maximum sowing of grain inthe spring. They were announced to the House of Commons in statements by the Minister of Food and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries on the5th February, 1946 (see the White Paper relating to &quot; The World GrainPosition &quot;-Cmd. 6737).61. On the consumption side the flour extraction rate has been increased from 80 per cent, to 85 per cent., which will mean the return to the darkerwar-time loaf; dangerously low stocks of wheat and flour have been accepted;a vigorous campaign to secure economy in bread consumption by avoidingwaste is being prosecuted; and supplies of feeding-stuffs for pigs and poultry
-    169are to be stringently curtailed. These measures have enabled the UnitedKingdom to accept a reduction of nearly 250,000 tons in wheat imports forthe first half of 1946.62. On the production side the Government&apos;s agriculture policy has been revised to meet the new situation. After the 1944 harvest it had been decidedthat in view of the then favourable prospect for supplies of cereals and feeding-stuffs a start should be made in livestock recovery on the lines contemplated by the Hot Springs Conference and as a means of giving greaterjgigight to the long-term soil fertility needs and better balanced crop rotations.IKcordingly it was agreed that the tillage area in 1946 could be reduced below that of 1945. This policy of revived livestock restoration has now been post-poned. Farmers have been advised by Agricultural Executive committees to put under tillage at least the same area in 1946 as in 1945. Tins will meanadditional calls on labour, machinery and fertilisers. It will involve the ploughing-up of some land that had been laid down to seeds in pursuance ofthe Government&apos;s policy to return to a more normal rotation of cropping.To meet these difficulties, the Government has announced, as an immediate and temporary measure, that the ploughing-up grant of  2 per acre shallapply to grassland that has been down for 3 years or longer instead of as heretofore only to grassland that has been down for 7 years or longer.63. To secure the maximum acreage of wheat consistent with soundagricultural practice for the 1947 harvest the prices of wheat from thatharvest will be increased, and farmers will be served with directions to sowspecified acreages of wheat to secure a minimum target of 2-5 million acres.64. Much of the coarse grains which would otherwise have been available from overseas for feeding to animals in the United Kingdom and other-countries will be required for direct human consumption, and the raising of extraction rates will reduce supplies of milling offals for feeding to animals.The ploughing up of more grass for the growing of cereals will reduce the grazing for cattle and sheep and thus retard the revival of the beef cattle and sheep populations. This will adversely affect supplies of home-producedmeat up to three or four years ahead.65. During the current winter. rationing period commercial pig and poultry keepers in the United Kingdom are receiving rations on the basis ofone-quarter of the numbers of stock kept before the war. It was formerlyintended to increase the rations as from May 1946 to the basis of one-third ofthe pre-war numbers. Because of the cereal shortage, rations for pigs and poultry will be reduced from 1st May, 1946, to the basis of only one-sixth ofthe pre-war numbers. This will result in a curtailment of the breeding of pigs and hatchings of chickens and possibly also in the premature slaughterof pigs and poultry to bring stock numbers more into line with the reducedvolume of feeding-stuffs supplies. This will mean an eventual reduction inthe domestic production of pigmeat and eggs.66. His Majesty&apos;s Government further decided, in face of the wheatshortage, to postpone a return to the pre-war level of the production of grainspirit (particularly whisky), which could have played a valuable part inthe recovery of export markets. During most of the war whisky productionin the United Kingdom was substantially reduced below the pre-war leveland, indeed, for about two years was completely suspended. Production ona limited scale was resumed in the autumn of 1944 and it had been intendedto allocate to distillers 300,000 tons of grain, mainly barley, from the 1945crops in the United Kingdom, so that production could be increased to approximately the pre-war level. In view, however, of the need to conservethe available supplies of barley for other purposes it has been decided that
only about 130,000 tons of grain should be allocated to distillers, with theresult that production during the year commencing September 1945 will be only about 43 per cent, of the pre-war rate. Stocks of spirits have reached a very low level and until production can be resumed at a much higher levelthere will inevitably be a shortage of whisky for export with a consequent reduction in the capacity to earn foreign currency.67. On 14th January, 1946, it was announced, in view of the seriouslabour shortage in agriculture, that the release arrangements from Forces(Class B), for 10,000 agricultural workers would be extended to cover anadditional 8,000 men. It is expected that these releases will be effec .1well in advance of the harvest, and provide a substantial reinforcement tothe experienced labour force in agriculture. The call-up of young agricultural workers has, in addition, been suspended until after the 1946 harvest, andarrangements have been made for the fullest use of prisoners of war.68. His Majesty&apos;s Government communicated in February 1946 with theGovernments of Canada, Australia and Argentine indicating the measureswhich were being taken in the United Kingdom and the United States tomeet the shortage and expressing the hope that they for their part would take all possible steps to increase the export of wheat and flour notonly during the first half of 1946 but during the next two years.69. At the same time the President of the United States announcedthat in the United States the wheat flour extraction rate would be raised from 72 per cent, to 80 per cent., that the use of wheat in the productionof alcohol and beer would be discontinued, that a vigorous campaign againstwaste of food, particularly bread, would be undertaken, and that additionalsteps would be taken to reduce the amount of grain fed to animals.Australia, which had already raised its target for wheat acreage from10-9 million acres in 1945 to 15-5 million acres for 1946, has also takenimmediate steps to reduce the amount of wheat fed to animals. InCanada wheat available for domestic milling is being reduced by 10 per cent,compared with 1945 and wheat for distilling is being reduced by 50 persent, compared with 1945.70. His Majesty&apos;s Government also took the initiative in arranging for the presentation to, and adoption by, the General Assembly of the united nations of the Resolution reproduced in Section V of the White Paper onThe World Grain Position, and for the presentation to, and adoption by,the Emergency Economic Committee for Europe of i ecommendationsregarding the action which should be taken by their members to secureincreases in their supplies cf grains for direct human consumption duringthe more immediate period and from the 1946 harvests.B. Rice71. It had always been foreseen that a problem of the utmost gravitywould arise at the end of the war if the Asiatic rice consuming countries were liberated before production of the rice exporting countries had been restored. During the occupation of Burma, Siam and French Indo-China bythe Japanese, production in those countries declined to a level sufficient onlyto meet internal needs. As a result, large areas have gone out of cultivation,and as a result of the general dislocation which has occurred it will be someyears before production can be restored to normal.72. On invasion of these countries by the Japanese, the Ministry of food at once took steps to encourage increased production from alternative sources,including Egypt, Brazil, West Africa and Madagascar, and concluded Agree-ments with the Governments of Egypt and Brazil under which the surpluses
-   1from these countries are being made available to His Majesty&apos;s Government.An agricultural expert was despatched to Madagascar and teams of expertshave been sent to Egypt and Brazil, where they continue to superviseprocurement and shipments on behalf of the Ministry of Food.73. Plans were, also made for dealing with the situation which mightbe expected to arise on liberation of the rice exporting countries in  South-East Asia. Detailed pians were laid down for the despatch of experts to burma at the earliest possible moment. These plans were duly carried out.rai order to enable the Government of Burma to fix prices at a pre-deterininedlevel and to relieve them of the work of marketing any surplus, the Ministryof Food undertook to buy the entire exportable surplus from Burma and market it on their behalf.74. In the case of Siam special measures were required to help in restoring production of rice and procurement for export. A team of expertswas collected and this Rice Unit left for Siam in September 1945. consumer goods and agricultural implements are being shipped to stimulate production,military landing craft have been used to assist in transport and replacementshave been provided for milling machinery. It is hoped that the Rice Unitwhich is acting in close co-operation with the United States representatives will succeed in obtaining very considerable supplies from Siam in spite offormidable difficulties.75. In French Indo-China, close liaison is being maintained with theFrench authorities who have agreed that any surplus from French Indo-China shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure of the combined food Board and be marketed at prices fixed in consultation with the Ministryof Food. Unfortunately, conditions of famine exist in parts of Indo-Chinaitself and rice from the more fortunate parts of the country will be needed to remedy this situation. It is not likely, therefore, that there will be any appreciable surplus for export yet awhile.76. Lord Killearn, wdio has recently been appointed Special commissioner in South-East Asia, has been charged with the special duty of stimulatingproduction and export of food from the whole area.C-Fish77. Vigorous steps have been taken to increase home fish supplies. Beforethe end of the war in Europe the Admiralty had already released as many as they could spare of the fishing vessels that had been requisitioned for naval service. With the termination of the war, these releases wereaccelerated as much as possible, and at the same time steps were taken togive a high degree of priority to the reconversion of these vessels for fishingpurposes. As a result the steam trawler fleet which is responsible for thebulk of the landings of British-caught fish increased from 465 in May 1945to over 750 at the beginning of March 1946. Further additions are beingmade at the rate of about 30 a month.78. At the same time various measures have been taken, including blockreleases of fishermen who have been on Naval service, to provide thenecessary crews for these vessels as they became ready to resume fishingoperations. In the meantime, the work of mine sweeping has been pressed on as speedily as possible, thus enabling large additional areas to be openedup for fishing; in particular a special effort was made in the late summer of 1945 to clear the East Anglian herring grounds in time for the autumnherring season of that year.[31508] d*
79. Other steps have also been taken to ensuring that the maximumuse was made of the vessels available for fishing. Improvements have been effected to the landing accommodation at certain ports, the supply of landinglabour has been augmented, and various measures have been adopted toassist in the maintenance of essential supplies to the vessels.80. While the foregoing measures have been put in hand on behalf of thelarger types of fishing vessels suitable for deep sea fishing, it has not beenoverlooked that the smaller vessels also make an appreciable contributionto food supplies. There was a danger that the full resumption of activtfby these vessels might have been hampered by lack of capital on the pareof their owners. Legislative provision has accordingly been made for financial assistance to herring fishermen and inshore fishermen generally toenable them to acquire and recondition boats and gear.81. As a result of all these measures, supplies of fresh, frozen and curedfish in the United Kingdom were increased to 162,000 tons landed weightfor the period 1st January to 16th March 1946 compared with 91,500 tons for the same period in 1945.Whaling82. Though whaling is not properly speaking a fishing operation, it may be convenient here to refer to the steps taken by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto organise whaling in the Antarctic during the present season to secureadditional supplies of oils and fats. For the first time since the outbreakof the late war, this work has been actively resumed, and special effortswere made to despatch floating factories to the Antarctic. In view of thelate start made by some of these, the season for their operations has been extended.Minister of Food&apos;s Mission to Washington in March 1946.83. It was against the general food background which has been depictedin this White Paper that the Minister of Food visited Washington in March1946. The main object of this mission was to discuss with the other membersof the Combined Food Board the current position in regard to wheat andrice, to devise methods of ensuring that maximum quantities were procuredand exported from the supplying countries, and to secure the most satisfactorydistribution of these two foodstuffs for the remainder of the first half of 1946.APPENDIXInter-Governmental Machinery for Food Control(a) The Combined Food Board84. This is a central body set up in July 1942 by the President of theUnited States of America and the Prime Minister of the United kingdom with the original function of ensuring that food-stuffs under the control ofthe United Nations were used with the maximum efficiency in prosecuting thewar. Canada was added to the Board in October 1943. The Board has beencarried over into the peace as providing a common forum for formulatingplans and recommendations regarding the production, procurement anddistribution of food supplies available for export during the present criticaltransitional stage. The Three Governments have recently announced their intention of continuing the Board until at least the 31st December, 1946.
21171The Board acts through its Commodity Committees, which cover each ofthe major food-stuffs in short supply, namely :  Cereals, Rice,Feeding-stuffs, Cocoa and Spices,Oils and Fats, Tea,Meat, Dried Fruits,4, Dairy Products, Fish and Fish Products.Sugar,I^^ddition the Fertilizer Committee and the Agricultural Seeds Committeemake recommendations regarding the international distribution of fertilizersand seeds.85. The Commodity Committees, which meet at frequent intervals&apos; to assess the current position and, if necessary, modify existing recommenda-tions in the light of changing conditions are composed of representativesof the main importing and exporting countries for each commodity. the membership of the Committees has been increased since the end of the war to include representation of liberated countries and of supplying countriesnot previously parties to an agreed distribution of their produce. The CerealsCommittee, for example, is composed of representatives of: -Canada, France,United States, Belgium,United Kingdom, Norway,Australia, Netherlands,The Argentine, Denmark;and the Meat Committee of :  United States, France,United Kingdom, Denmark,Canada, Netherlands,Belgium, The Argentine.Representatives of the Dominion members of the London Food Counciland of India attend meetings of the Committees when matters of interestto them are discussed. Their main liaison with the Combined Food board is, however, through the London Food Council. An U.N.R.R.A. repre-sentative attends meetings of the Committees of the Board dealing withfoodstuffs in which that organisation is interested in order to support theclaims of countries for which it is responsible.86. Data regarding available supplies, normal requirements, withstatistics of pre-war consumption, stocks and other information of assistanceto the Committees in preparing recommendations are provided by theGovernments that are members of the Committees and also by countrieswhich participate in supplies though they are not directly represented.This co-operation enables the Committees to keep ahead of the currentsupply and demand position and to estimate the necessity for maintainingallocation of any foodstuff that is currently in less critical short supply. Insome cases (for example, tea, meat and sugar) arrangements have beenmade through the Board for the bulk purchase by one Government onbehalf of all importing countries. This has prevented competitive buyingand contributed to avoiding widespread inflation.87. Although neither the Board nor its Committees have mandatory orexecutive powers, they have constituted during the past four years a most effective piece of machinery for securing the maximum degree of agreement
among producing and consuming countries regarding the distribution offood-stuffs available for export, where the available supply falls short of thetotal demand.  The Board&apos;s recommendations are in fact habitually accepted.(b) London Food Council88. This body, consisting of a United Kingdom Chairman and repre-sentatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union ofSouth Africa, India, Southern Rhodesia and the Colonies, provides a forum for consultation about food supplies in relation to the countries representedupon it. and machinery through which recommendations to and from W*eCombined Food Board may be considered. The Council has set upCommodity Committees similar to those of the Board, and through these arrangements, through the United Kingdom representation on the Counciland the Board, and through attendance of representatives of the CounciFsmembers at meetings of the Board&apos;s Committees when matters of interestto those members are discussed, the work of the Council, whilecomplementary to that of the Board, is fully integrated with it.(c) Emergency Economic Committee for Europe89. The Emergency Economic Committee for Europe was set up inJune 1945. Its membership includes representatives of the Governments ofBelgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway,Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. U.N.R.R.A. and theGovernment of Czechoslovakia are observers. Close liaison is maintainedwith other international organisations such as the Food and agriculture organisation, Combined Food Board, European Coal Organisation, EuropeanCentral Inland Transport Organisation.90. The aim of the Committee, which has no mandatory powers, is toserve as a forum for the exchange of information; to assist in stimulating theproduction of essential goods and raw materials in Europe; to co-ordinate thedistribution of goods and generally to foster trade interchange within europe in order to diminish the demands for short supply commodities from outside.The detailed work of the Committee is done through working groups, sub-committees or affiliates covering food and agriculture, fertilisers, industry and materials, public utilities, enemy exports and timber.91. The United Kingdom has taken full part in all activities of theCommittee.Wt.- 3/46 F.O.P. 31508 Gp. 340
