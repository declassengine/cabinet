;.;IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJ:JSTY* S GOVERNMENSECRETCP. (1+6) 1101dth March,. 19u7*CIVIL AVIATION bill memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Civil aviation in the absence abroad of my Minister I submit (appended tothis Paper)  the draft Civil Aviation Bill.        This Bill was referred to in the Legislative Programme as the Air transport bill.2.        The proposals in the Bill were submitted to the lord president&apos;s Committee in L.P. (1+6) 1k and received the general approval of that Committee on 25th January (L. P. (1+6) 3rd MeetingMinute 2).3.        I ask for permission to introduce  the Bill in the House ofCommons during the present month or the first week of April/The Legislation Committee will consider the Bill on Tuesday,19th March.      If the Bill is approved I also ask to be allowedto make any amendments of a minor or drafting nature which may-be found desirable after it has been approved and before its introduction.Scope of the bill+.        The Bill has two main purposes,  the first to reservescheduled air services to three statutory corporations, and thesecond to authorise  the Minister of Civil Aviation to acquireaerodromes for use, primarily, by these statutory corporations and in particular cases by foreign air lines also.      Certainsupplementary provisions relating to matters connected with air transport services and the use of aerodromes have been includedin the Bill.Summary of the  provisions of the BillPart. I - Air services.        The three statutory corporations to which scheduled services are to be entrusted are:-(i) The existing British Overseas Airways Corporation,established under the British Overseas Airways Act,1939.      This corporation will operate services which the British Commonwealth and Empire and tothe Par East.      Its maximum capital is to be fiftymillion pounds.(ii) A new corporation,  to be called the British european airways Corporation.      It will operate services inEurope including the internal services of the british isles.      Its maximum capital is to be twenty millionpounds.COPY NO.CABINET

72(iii) Another new corporation,  to be called the British south american Airways Corporation.      This will operateservices between the United Kingdom and South America.Its maximum capital is to be ten million pounds.6.       The continuity of the British Overseas Airways corporation is not to be interrupted and accordingly the Act of 1939 is notbeing repealed, although certain of its provisions are cancelledor modified by the Bill.      The ,two now corporations are  to bemodelled upon that corporation.7.       Part I of the Bill is based upon the Act of 1939,  the chiefalteration being the reservation (by Clause 22) of scheduledair services for the three corporations.      Other importantmodifications are (i)  the wider powers of control given to theMinister in Clause 3,  (ii) the provision in Clause 13 that eachcorporation should set up joint consultative machinery for settling terms and conditions of employment, and (iii)  theprovision in Clause 19 that the Minister may require the thrcorporations to establish for their employees  joint pension schemes and other benefit schemes,  to which members of theexisting 3.0. A. C.   schemes will be allowed to transfer.8.       Provision is made for Exchequer grants up to 31st March1956,  the maximum aggregate figures being,  for all the corporations, ten million pounds for the period to 31st March19U7 and also for the year ending 31st March 19U8,  and eightmillion pounds for each year thereafter.9.        The spheres of operation of the corporations are notdefined in the Bill.      They may overlap in certain areas and itis intended that the allocation of routes and services shallbe made by the Minister.10.      Foreign operators will be allowed to run scheduled air services to the United Kingdom in accordance with the terms ofinte r-gevernme ntal agreements.11. The functions of the corporations are to provide scheduledair services and to do all other forms of aerial work, includingwork on charter terms. .12.      A general power is given to each corporation to do whateveris necessary for facilitating the discharge of its functions.In view, however,  of the need, for giving some indication of theprincipal powers included in the general -power, twenty-one ofthose powers have been specified in Clause 2 (2)  of the Bill.The exercise of these powers will be subject to the Minister&apos;control - see paragraph 17 below.13.      In accordance with polic.   announced in the White Paper on british Air Services (Cmd.  6712), aerial charter work is notreserved in the Bill to the statutory corporations.      Independentoperators are at liberty to compete with the corporations inthat field, provided that they maintain terms and conditionsof employment in accordance with a formula recommended by theMinistry of Labour and National Service.      Clause 38 is basedon that formula.1h.      Much care has had to be given to defining the border line between scheduled air services, which are reserved to the corporations, and charter work,  in which the corporations willcompete with other operators.      The chief task has been toensure that an independent ,opera tor will not be able to run a regular service under the guise of charter work.

7315*      Clause 22 of the Bill attempts to solve the problem by imposing two conditions on journeys by aircraft for hire orreward.      The conditions ore, firstly,  that no person otherthan the corporations shall *be allowed to make advanceannouncements concerning the time of departure or thedestination of his aircraft and,  secondly, that no person or group of persons shall be allowed to contract for the hire  :.f less than the whole capacity of an aircraft which isnot operated by the corporations.      Power to obtain information for the purpose of enforcing those conditions is provided for in Clause 23.1 6.      The Minister,  to whom clauses 22 and 23 have beentelegraphed, has asked for his position to be reserved until he has had an opportunity of studying them on his return onthe 19th March.17.      The Minister is given general powers of control overthe activities  of the corporations.      Clause 3 (l)  enables himto limit the powers of the corporations by an order which willnot be laiel before Parliament, but will be published inaccordance with the appropriate procedure proposed in theStatutory Instruments Bill.      Clause 3 (2) enables him togive directions, without formal instrument,  to any of the corporations after consultation with the chairman of thecorporation.      Clause 3 (2) is modelled on the corresponding provision in the Bank of England Act.      The members of theBritish Overseas Airways Corporations (other than theChairman, who is abroad) have been consulted about Clause 3and have accepted its provisions,  although they felt thatthe Minister&apos;s powers of control were too wide.Fart II - Land18.      This part of the Bill is designed to give  to theMinister power to acquire all the aerodromes necessary foruse by the statutory corporations and such other land, away from aerodromes, as may be required for radio installationsfor air navigation purposes.&apos;19.      Provision is also made (Clauses 27 and 29)  for powersto acquire rights over land in the vicinity of thoseaerodromes and to restrict the use of such land so far \u isnecessary to ensure the safety of aircraft approaching orleaving and also,  in the case of radio installations,, toensure absence  of local interference with the transmissionsfrora such instalI ations.20.      Clause 28 of the Bill gives  to the Minister of Transportpowers to stop up or divert and to reprovide highways whichcross, or are made dangerous by the use of, aerodromes vested in the minister of Civil ^aviation.      i understand tii^t he haoagreed to exercise these powers, provided that the cost is.borne on the Ministry of Civil Aviation vote.21,      He-housing of tenants evicted from houses on land aquired for aerodromes is dealt with in Clause 32, which requires the Minister of Civil Aviation to provide or arrangefor housing accommodation if he thinks such action desirable.I understand that the Minister of Health has no power toensure that such persons will be re-housed and that he doesnot object to the provisions of Clause 32.

7422.      .X...-.r.st point cut to the Cabinet the extremely widenature of the powers conferred by clauses 27 to 29, and also by Clause 30 (which relates to the removal of burial grounds)clause 31  (which gives a power of entry for the purp;so ofsurvey) ana clause 32.      Some or all of these powers will berequired/ not only in connection with Heathrow aerodrome, butalso in connection with other State aerodromes.      The issue to be decided, therefore,  is -whether these powers should betaken generally in a public bill, or acquired piecemeal by a-series of bills relating to particular aerodromes.      I seek the approval of the Cabinet for the principle that they shouldbe taken generally,  once for all.23.      I am advised that the powers contained in Part II of- theBill will be sufficient for the purpose of acquiring and developing the London Airport at Heathrow and &quot;that  if theyare granted by Parliament the Heathrow (Acquisition of Land)Bill, listed in the Legislative Programme, will not benecessary.      On the assumption that the Civil Aviation Bill goesforward in its ore sent general form it is proposed to drop the Heathrow Bill,2U.      Where land is compulsorily acquired for the purposes ofPart II of the Bill the procedure closely resembles that laiddown in the Distribution of Industry Act,  19h7,  and theAcquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) Bill.      In thecase of land of statutory undertakers, local authorities andthe National Trust,  compulsory acquisition will be by ordersubject to special Parliamentary procedure.25.      Compensation for the compulsory purchase of land will be assessed in accordance with the relevant provisions of theAcquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919,  theTown and Country Planning Act 1 9hh and the Requisitioned land and War Works Act 19h5oPart III - Miscellaneous26.      In Part III, I most direct special attention to Clause 36,under which the Minister is to be given power to impose restrictions on flying from aerodromes in the vicinity of Stateaerodromes.      The Air Navigation Act,  1920 gives the minister a power to license aerodromes, and refusal of such a licencewould hot. attract compensation.      But this power is conferredsolely for the purposes of the Paris Convention,  and I do nutthink it could properly be used for the purpose of protecting aState aerodrome,      I have therefore thought it right to seek a new power for this purpose and to provide that aerodromeowners whose interests are injured by the exercise of the power should receive compensation,  except where the aerodrome was established after the pas sin;-: of the Bill and without theMinister&apos;s consent,27.      The  establishment of an Air Transport Advhsory Council isprovided for in Clause 35.      This Council will not itself fixfares and freight rates but will make recommendations to theMinister on these and other matters relating to air transport.The Minister will decide whether effect is to be given to theCouncil&apos;s recommenetations.28       The provisions of the Bill cover England, and Wales,Scotland and Northern Ireland,  and will be extended to theChannel Islands and the Isle of Man by Orders in Council.The Channel Island representatives pressed, on constitutional

75grounds, for this course  t. bo token, although theyaffirmed their willingness to be brought within the reservation of scheduled air services and other provisionsof the Bill;    and the Manx representatives took the sameline-.A Special Point on the Bill29.      Clause h (1) requires the three corporations to useaircraft,  airframes and aero-engines designed and manufactured within His Majesty&apos;s Dominions unless theMinister waives that requirement.      The President of theBoard of Trade &quot;feels that the enactment into law ofsuch a provision would be very unfortunate at the presenttime,  since it would be regarded abroad as foreshadowing apolicy of extreme pro tec tie-n for British manufactures and100 per cent.    preference to Empire manufacture bynationalised enterprises at a time when we are about to embark on an international Conference on Trade andEmployment on the basis of the United States proposals withwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government have declared themselvesto be &apos;in full agreement on all important points&apos;&quot;.      Heasks for the substitution of a sub-clause requiring the corporations to obtain the Minister&apos;s assent to theiracquisition of aircraft and components generally;    it wouldthen be open  to the Minister to give a general permit tothe corporation to acquire aircraft manufactured in theEmpire,, while his specific approval would still have to beobtained for foreign acquisitions.30.      It is laid down in the White Paper &quot;British air services&quot;,  (Cmd.  6712) paragraph 27,  that &quot;it will bethe general policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to requirethe Corporations tc  use British aircraft types&quot;.      Theindustry will certainly expect this policy to be  translated into law.31.      I propose  that &quot;United Kingdom&quot; be substituted for&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Dominions&quot; in Clause h (1).      This should go some way towards meeting the President of the BoardTrade,  but apart from this modification 1 feel bound topress for the Clause as it stands.I.
