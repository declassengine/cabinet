Copy No.   j 8CP. (46) 118.2bth March, 1946.CABINET.ISARAWAK.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. At the Cabinet meeting on the 13th November last (Cm. (45) 52) I was authorised to facilitate the intention of the Rajah of Sarawak to cede that territory and invited to proceed with the conclusion of a fresh agreement forthis purpose as soon as the consent of the Raj ah&apos;s Councillors in Sarawak hadbeen obtained.2.   In accordance with the Cabinet conclusions the Rajah, towards the endof December last, sent an emissary to Sarawak to consult his Councillors, and,as a result of the report of that emissary, he made a definite proposal for cessionin January. He then represented that certain documents which his emissary had brought back from Sarawak made unnecessary any further consultation with the council&apos;s, but I was advised that these documents were open to challenge onI legal grounds, and I therefore informed the Rajah that, while the proposal forjeession was entirely acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government, it must be subject to the understanding that the legal and constitutional steps necessary for itsi validity would be taken in Sarawak.3. The intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government were then reported toI Parliament in a statement on the 6th February, but this aroused criticism bothIthere and in the Press and it was urged from many quarters that the GovernmentIshould satisfy itself by independent enquiry that the cession would be inI accordance with the wishes of the people. Early this month, after consultationI with the Lord Privy Seal and with the approval of the Prime Minister, it was1 decided that two Members of Parliament should be sent to Sarawak to undertakeI that enquiry.4.   I am glad to say that the Rajah has accepted the need for the measuresfoutlined in paragraphs 2 and 3, although he felt that the delay which theyIinvolved was undesirable, inasmuch as it provided those elements who were[opposed to cession for reasons other than the interests of the people with anopportunity to create trouble.5.   Two further points arise out of a report by the Law Officers on certain[questions which were put to them.  The first relates to the position of the Rajah&apos;sIbrpther, the Tuan Muda.   According to the Law Officers&apos; opinion, it will be[necessary for the Council Negri (which is equivalent to a Legislative Council) toIpass a law setting aside the Wills of the two previous Rajahs barring rights ofIsuccession under them, and authorising the cession of the territory by the RajahIm Council.   The Law Officers go on to advise that it would be proper to com-JPpnsate the Tuan Muda for loss of inheritance in the event of cession.   Thelp an Muda has not raised this question of compensation with His Majesty&apos;;;Ijuovernment but, in a letter to the Prime Minister, has indicated willingness toaccept the decision of the State Councils on the question of cession, provided thatJtVS a^e *G attendl their proceedings in person and to state his case to them.Iff . ;%jah has already informed me that he has refused a request for theseiacilities since he considers that it would be undignified to ventilate in the council&apos;s what he regards as a family quarrel.  In all the circumstances the advice9d the Law Officers in the matter of compensation for the Tuan Muda does not,lln my view, make it necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take the clearly[31532]
difficult course of stipulating that the Tuan Muda should be given the oppor-tunity to state his objections to cession before the Council in Sarawak. It is theintention of the Rajah that both the Tuan Muda and his son should receiveincomes of  5,000 and  2,800 per annum respectively from the Trust Fund whichis to be created in the event of cession. The Tuan Muda and his son at presentreceive incomes of  4.000 and  2,800 respectively from Sarawak funds.6. The second matter is the recommendation of the Law Officers that theTreaty of Cession should be made subject to ratification by Parliament. The LawOfficers state that there is no rule of law or indeed of constitutional practice which requires a Treaty acquiring territory for the Crown to be approved by Parlia-ment, although they are of opinion that Parliamentary approval does appear tobe necessary for any transaction which may impose a financial burden upon the taxpayer. The transfer of Sarawak to the Crown is not likely to impose any financial burden on the taxpayer, but quite apart from this question, the LawOfficers&apos; view is that, in view of the development of international law and of theprinciples of self-determination in recent years, it might not be inappropriatenow to establish a practice of submitting all treaties involving transfer of territory, to, as well as from, the Crown for Parliamentary ratification. Thisrecommendation clearly raises wide political rather than legal issues. The point is not unrelated to the general question of Parliamentary control of ColonialConstitutions, which it has already been agreed should be fully explored whenthe present exceptional pressure on the legal staff of the Colonial Office is relaxed.The adoption of the Law Officers&apos; recommendation without full consideration ofall its implications would, in my view, be unwise and it would seem unlikely thatit could be given that consideration before the text of the Cession agreement has to be settled. There is a further objection to this recommendation from thepoint of view of the delay which it would involve in the cession of the territory.If the cession were made subject to Parliamentary ratification it would be some weeks, if not months, before it could be carried through. It is. I think, doubtfulwhether the Rajah would agree to this further delay, in addition to those involved by the measures which he has already accepted (paragraphs 2 and 3), and ifParliamentary ratification were made a condition of the cession, it might prejudice the whole proposal.7.   I should be glad to know that my colleagues agree (a) that, in view of the Rajah&apos;s attitude (paragraph 5), His Majesty&apos;sGovernment need not take the difficult course of stipulating that theTuan Muda should be given the opportunity of stating, before theCouncil in Sarawak, his objections to the cession of that territory;(&amp;) that the cession need not be made subject to Parliamentary ratification(paragraph 6).G. II. H.Colonial Office,25th March, 1946.
