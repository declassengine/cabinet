this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT is proposed that the next series of Olympic Games meetings should beheld in this country in 1948.Lord Portal and Lord Burghley, the President and Chairman of the BritishOlympic Association, informed me recently that the International OlympicAssociation were proposing to offer the Games to this country in 1948, and askedwhether this would meet with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government. I told them that I should welcome the proposal, since I consider that, apart fromthe honour conferred by the invitation, the occasion would provide an excellentopportunity for an organised drive to attract tourists to this country. TheInternational Olympic Association have now accepted a formal invitation issued,according to the customary form, by the Lord Mayor of London.2. When the Olympic Games were last held in this country in 1908, theywere organised by the British Olympic Association, which represents thegoverning bodies of the various sports. The responsibility fpr organising theGames should again be left in the hands of the British Olympic Association,who will presumably be willing also to bear the financial responsibility. some government machinery will, however, be required to assist the Association inobtaining the various facilities required for competitors and visitors. TheGovernment are also interested in-exploiting the opportunity of attracting touriststo this country in connection with the Games.3. For these purposes I propose that an Inter-Departmental committeeshould be appointed, composed of representatives. of the various departments which can assist in seeing that the Games are turned to good account in thedevelopment of our tourist trade. (It would be helpful in this connection if anearly decision could be reached on the question which Department should bemade responsible for the catering industry. I understand that this question isunder review by a Treasury Committee which is considering the latest report ofthe Catering Wages Commission.)At a later stage it would probably be useful to set up a small executive agency,working under the authority of the Inter-Departmental committee, to handle day-to-day business and to maintain contact with the British Olympic Association.4. I propose that the Inter-Departmental committee should consist of repre-sentatives of the following Departments : Foreign Office, Board of Trade, HomeOffice, Scottish Office, Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Works. In addition,the following Departments might receive papers and be invited to attend meetingswhen required : Dominions Office, India Office, Colonial Office, Ministry of Labourand National Service, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Plealth and Ministryof Civil Aviation. Other organisations, such as the Arts Council and the StandingCouncil on Museums, might also be brought into consultation as required.5. It would also be useful to associate with the official Committee a smalladvisory body containing a few of the leading personalities in the catering andentertainment world and headed by someone with imagination and ideas. Thisadvisory body could put forward suggestions for exploiting all the practicablemeans of accommodating and entertaining visitors to the country in connectionPrinted for the Cabinet.

with the Games, and would also serve as a channel for communicating to theGovernment any special difficulties confronting the catering and entertainmenttrades in providing for the expected tourist traffic.6. The Games will last for about six weeks, and the International OlympicAssociation are likely to propose that they should be held in July and August.This is the peak of the holiday season; and, as a result of the introduction of holidays with pay, the pressure on hotel accommodation in the holiday seasonis likely to be much greater in 1946 and subsequent years than it was in theyears before the war. It would be preferable, therefore, that the Games shouldbe held earlier, e.g., in June, I propose, subject to the views of my colleagues, tomake this suggestion to the Olympic Association.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,6th April, 1946.
