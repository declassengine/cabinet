//THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT102Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 112.lUh March, 1946:CABINET.PROPOSED TREATY WITH TRANS-JORDAN.Memorandum by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for theColonies.ON the 28th February (CM. (46) 19th Meeting, Minute 6) the cabinet authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies to proceed with negotiationswith The Amir Abdullah of Trans-Jordan on the basis of the draft Treaty andMilitary Convention annexed to CP. (46) 63, subject to the inclusion in thosedrafts of the revised Articles set out in paragraph 6 of CP. (46) 82. Negotia-tions have proceeded with the Trans-Jordan Delegation on this basis, in an atmosphere of the utmost cordiality and goodwill, and as a result agreement hasbeen reached on a revised draft of the Treaty (with the former Military Conventiontransformed into an Annex to the Treaty) in the terms appended to thismemorandum.2. It will be seen that several Articles have been recast and the arrangementhas been altered; but in general the revised draft gives full effect to the intentionswhich it is desired to express in the Treaty. I need only draw attention to thefollowing points :- A. Draft Treaty.A Preamble has been added.Article 1.   A sentence has been added as follows : &quot; His Majesty The King recognises Trans-Jordan as a fully independent state and His Highness The Amir as the sovereign thereof.&quot;Article 4 (corresponding to Article 3 in the draft in CP. (46) 82 (Revise)).The Trans-Jordan Delegation pointed out that the reference in the first line toa dispute &apos;&apos; between Trans-Jordan &apos;&apos; and a third State was not quite consistent with Article 5 (corresponding to Article 4 of the draft in CP. (46) 82 (Revise)),since the latter envisaged circumstances in which either High Contracting Partybecame involved in hostilities. This formal inconsistency has been removed bythe use at the beginning of Article 4 of the words &quot; should any dispute arise witha third State &quot; taken from the corresponding Article of the Egvptian Treaty of1936.Article 9 (corresponding to Article 8 of the original draft) has been redraftedin consultation with the Board of Trade. Paragraph 3 extends the provisions ofparagraph 2 (which include provision for most favoured nation treatment) to theColonies, overseas territories and protectorates of His Majesty The King and the territories administered by His Majesty under mandate or trusteeship. Para-graph 4, to meet a point raised by the Trans-Jordan Delegation, exempts from theprovisions regarding the grant of most favoured nation treatment (a) any special customs privileges which at the date of signature of theTreaty are extended by Trans-Jordan to goods produced or manu-factured in any territory which in 1914 was wholly included in AsiaticTurkey or Arabia, provided that such privileges are not accorded toany other foreign country (thus preserving the special provision madeby the last sentence of Article 18 of the Mandate) and[31483] b
(b) customs privileges granted by one of the High Contracting Parties to a third country in virtue of a customs union (for example, any customs union which might be formed in future by members of the arab league).A rticle 13 (corresponding to Article 12 in the original draft). The original draft provided that any difference relative to the application or interpretation ofthe Treaty, if not settled by direct negotiation, should be &quot; dealt with inaccordance with the Charter of the United Nations.&quot; The effect of both the new and the old texts is that, if both parties agree on any one of the various methodsof settlement specified in the Charter, they can adopt that method; but in the caseof disagreement on the choice of method of settlement, under the old draft triematter would have gone to the Security Council, whereas under the new draft itwill go to the International Court of Justice. Both texts are entirely in accord with the Charter, since the Charter says that, as a general rule, legal disputesshould be referred to the Court, and disputes on the interpretation and appli-cation of a Treaty are specified in the Courts Statute as one of the classes of disputes with which the Court is competent to deal. The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs considers that resort to the Court rather than to the security council is the best method of settling disputes arising out of the interpretation of a Treaty.B. Annex to the Treaty.Article 1. The Trans-Jordan Delegation represented that the power to station armed forces of His Majesty in Trans-Jordan under the original draft was too unrestricted. The Article has now been amended to provide that HisMajesty may station armed forces in places where they are stationed at thedate of signature of the Treaty and &quot; in such other places as may be agreedupon.&quot;Article 2. The Chiefs of Staff consider that it should be made clear thatwe retain the right for His Majesty&apos;s ships to visit the port of Aqaba on priornotification only. The Trans-Jordan Delegation have agreed that this point should be covered in a confidential Minute of Interpretation which would be signed at the time of signature of the Treaty but would not be published.Article 4 of the original draft provided that The Amir would grantfacilities for the recruiting of his nationals into the Trans-Jordan frontier force. The Trans-Jordan Delegation indicated that The Amir was ready tocontinue the grant of these facilities, but asked that the point should not be mentioned in the published Treaty. It was agreed that it might be covered inthe Minute of Interpretation referred to above.Articles 5 and 6, regarding the immunities of members of His Majesty&apos;forces and reimbursement for expenditure incurred by The Amir under Articles1, 2 and 4 and damage arising from action by members of His Majesty&apos;s armed forces, have been considerably revised. They are acceptable to the Chiefs ofStaff in their present form.Article 8. The Minute of Interpretation will make clear that the cost ofthe military units for the purposes of this Article includes an appropriate con-tribution towards pensions and gratuities.Article 9. The Amir asked for omission from the Treaty of the provision that the Commandant of the Arab Legion should continue to be a British officer.He has, however, made it clear that the senior British officer will be given thenecessary authority for ensuring the efficiency of The Amir&apos;s forces and thepoint will be mentioned in the Minute of Interpretation. No objection need beraised to omission from the Annex to the Treaty itself of a provision whichmight be open to criticism as inconsistent with the independent status of trans-Jordan.3.   At the time of signature of the Treaty there will be an Exchange of notes dealing with the following points  -(a) the continued use of Palestine currency by Trans-Jordan for the timebeing;(b) the continued operation by the Palestine Government of a fisheriesinstallation at Aqaba in Trans-Jordan territory;(c) the operation of the Trans-Jordan section of the Hejaz Railway; and(d) civil air services.The terms of these notes are still under negotiation with the Trans-JordanDelegation.
?. 4. The terms of the Treaty have been discussed with the Trans-JordanDelegation in the closest consultation between the Colonial Office and the ForeignOffice and the draft has been submitted to the Chiefs of Staff Committee andis in a form acceptable to them.   I now submit it for final approval by theCabinet before signature.5 (Intld.)        A. C.
