cabinet lord PRESIDENT&apos;S COMMITTEEBULKPURCHASE OF COTTONMemorandum by the president of the Board of trade my colleagues ?:ill be aware that last autumn thequestion was raised by the Liverpool Cotton association and the Master Cotton Spinners as to what the intentions of the Government were as to the future method of purchasingof raw cotton.As a result of this approach I received a deputation from the two bodies on 7th November last ana promised thema reply early this year.      There is an urgent need to decideupon the policy since the Cotton Control, which is atpresent responsible for bulk purchase,  is losing its staffthrough uncertainty as to the future and the merchantsare unable to take any steps to build up their businessesfor the same reason.      Furthermore a number of demobilisedmen are now returning who were formerly engaged on the    aLiverpool Cotton Market in various capacities and it is hardly fair to them that they should not know whetherthey will ever have a job to go back to.It is therefore essential that an early decision shouldbe arrived at and I would like to implement my promise by making a statement on this matter before I leave for India.In order that the matter might be thoroughly exploredand that I might have available all points of view I havehad submitted to me the following documents:(1) Memorandum by the Manchester and LiverpoolCotton Association.(2) Memorandum by the Master Cotton SpinnersAssociation.(3)  Comments by the Cotton Control on Documents (1)and (2). &apos;(IP) A scheme by the Cotton Control for continued bulk purchase by the Control.(5) Memorandum by a Labour Party group of economistsunder the chairmanship of Lv.il.  Edwards, M.P.(6) Report by Bulk Purchase Official Committee in thelight of (l)-(U)  inclusive above.

Cf those documents (1) and (2) are of course in favourof return to private purchase as pre-war.(3) and (d)  are in favour of the continuance of bulk purchase on present lines but adapted to peace-time require-ments.(5) supports (3) and (h)  on a theoretical basis.(6)  comes down (not unanimously)  on the side of privatepurchase as pre-war with some control and adaptation of thepre-v/ar methods.It is not possible to recite in this paper all thearguments put forward on either side,  but report No.6 is an excellent summary of the arguments on both sides and has been drawn up very objectively.      I attach this report in the Appendixhereto.In the summary in paragraph 13 the following passage occurs:&quot;&quot;Bearing this in mind (i. e.   the major objective ofan efficient industry and export trade)  the Committeehas tried to make an objective assessment of theeconomic advantage of the two methods of purchase.There are risks cither way and responsible opinionsboth inside and outsice the industry differ on theeconomic merits of the two methods.      The Committee,for its part, feels that the arguments are extremelyevenly balanced and that it is not possible to bedogmatic upon the subject, &quot;The deciding factor in the majoritydecision is expressed as follows :-&quot;For this reason in a situation of a considerable uncertainty as to the course of future world trade,we think that a return to private importation givesus the greater freedom to decide in the light of experience;    and that accordingly the onus of prooflies upon the. advocates of centralised purchaserather than on the advocates of a return to theprivate market system. &quot;The Committee then finds the case &quot;not proven&quot;, and their recommendations are set out in paragraph 1 h.Two questions therefore arise.(1)  are the merits of the  two arguments equally balanced?(2)  If so,  is the onus to displace the present bulk purchase or to displace the pre-war system?In other words,  if the merits are equal should we continue as at present or revert to thepre-war system.There is,  I think,  no doubt in anyone&apos;s mind that thepresent bulk purchase system can be adapted to peace-time requirements.      There iS&apos; not in my view the same certainty that the pre-v/ar system can bo adapted to obviate its admittedweaknesses e. g.  speculation.      Upon the first point - the rivalmerits of the two methods - the arguments will be found setout fairly and clearly in paragraphs 3 and 9 of the Appendix.

I agree with the presentation of the case inparagraph 8.      As to the rival case in paragraph 9I would draw my colleagues&apos;  attention to the followingpoints :-(i)  In paragraph 9(i)  it is to be remarked that thepossibility of remedying the pre-war defectsis not expressed as by any means certain,whereas in paragraph 8(i)  it is accepted that the scheme    suggested, by the CottonControl would remedy the defects.(ii)  I do not accept the argument in paragraph 9(ii)that a free market in cotton would fit in betterwith a situation in which there are multilateral trade arrangements.      It seems to me that eithersystem could equally fit into such a scheme in the light of the state purchase conditionsin the International Trade Organisation Agenda.(iii)  In paragraph (iii)  it is to be observed that inorder to square the system of private importwith the maintenance of stable prices for yarnsand cloth there would have to be a subsidy&quot;at some suitable point&quot; injected into the manufacturing chain.      There is of course sucha subsidy at present,  but as a matter ofpermanent policy it would in my view be better to bring about a stable price through a subsidybased upon a controlled raw cotton purchaserather than try afterwards to iron out theinequalities created by varying private purchase,prices.(iv)  I think it is true that the war time conditions set out in 9(lv) do not provide any absolutecriterion for the success of bulk purchase in peace-time,  especially on a falling market.It will of course be essential to see thatany central organisation for bulk purchasehas liberty of quick action on prices etc.My general reaction therefore to these two paragraphssummarising the arguments is that the merits are morecertain on the whole for central bulk purchase and thatthe chance of the private system of purchase getting rid of its defects and fitting the new circumstances is moreproblematical.I do not therefore agree that the merits are equallybalanced, they are in my view in. favour of continuing thepresent system and not reverting to the pre-war system.But even assuming that the view was correct that the merits of the two methods wore evenly balanced from aneconomic point of view I should not accept that the onus of proof was on those who upheld the existing method.If private enterprise is now allowed to resume thecontrol of the cotton market it will not be possible withinthe term of this Parliament to return to bulk purchase,since there will not be sufficient time to prove that in normal circumstances and with new regulations and contractsthe system has failed to work.

So far therefore as this Parliament is concerned a. decision now taken will decide the matter one way orthe other.In my view the onus of displacing the present system which has admittedly worked well is on those who seek to restore private enterprise and that onus has not in my view(or in that of the Official Committee) been discharged.There is of course a further factor which quiteproperly the Official Committee did not take into account and that is the political aspect of this problem.The Labour Party has always inveighed against thespeculative nature of those commodity markets and has beenin favour of bulk purchase.Had there been some strong economic argument to thecontrary it would of course have had to be taken intoaccount in arriving at a decision.      But where, as here,upon the most impartial examination of the rival economicvirtues of the two systems it is found that neither hasany merit over the other,  it is in my view proper that the &apos;Party&apos;s declared policy should be put into operation.finally,  I would warn my colleagues that a decision to abolish private dealings in this commodity market will raise a storm of protest from all uphold.ers of private enterprise.It will be considered, as more dangerous an attack on privateenterprise than even the nationalisation of a singleindustry and it will rally both the industry, the dealers *in the commodity market and. the f inanciers against it.Even the more moderate press such as the Times are likelyto attack the decision strongly.No doubt the Opposition will ask for a debate on this first major decision as to commodity markets as they will see in it the precursor of other similar decisions in thefuture.It is,  I believe, the best case on which to.state our policy owing to the admittedly unsatisfactory speculationwhich took place in the market before the war.I recommend my colleagues that :-(1) a decision should be taken to continue the centralbulk purchase of cotton on the same lines as thoseof today with such necessary adaptations as havebeen worked out by the Cotton Control;(2) an announcement should be made in the House ofCommons to this effect,  the statement beingaccompanied by short arguments in the form ofthose in paragraph 8 of the Appendix.(Intld. )    R.

--JPFENDIXCentralised Purchase of CottonReoort by the Official Committee1.      In view of the great importance of raw cotton and theexistence prior to the war of a fully organised commoditymarket, the Liverpool Cotton Exchange, your Committee appointed a special sub-committee of representatives of the Raw MaterialsDepartment, Board of Trade, Treasury, Bank of England andEconomic Section, Cabinet Offices to examine the presentposition and to report on the relative merits of centralisedpurchase and the organised market as methods of procurementof supplies of raw cotton.2.      There&apos;were before the war about 200 raw cotton merchants and &quot;buying brokers operating in Liverpool and Manchester.    Thebrokers bought-on behalf of spinners;    the merchants, importedas principals and held stocks for resale.    Many firms dobusiness both as merchants and brokers, and there are also some firms who act purely as selling agents for overseasshippers. &apos; Besides being intermediaries through whom raw cotton was imported into Great Britain, the brokers and merchants provided access to organised &quot;spot&quot; and &quot;futures&quot;markets in raw cotton.    These were widely used by spinners tosecure, cover against fluctuations of prices, and the existenceof a .large spot stock also enabled spinners to obtain, withinwide limits, the particular growth, grade and staple, whichthey required as and when they needed it.3.      In the Spring of 1941, stocks of cotton in II.K. were taken over by the Cotton Control, and -11 subsequent purchaseshave been made by the Control on public account.    At the timemerchants were informed that these measures were adoptedbecause of war conditions, but that no undertaking could begiven as to the restoration of their activities at the end ofhostilities.    The actual method of purchase has differedaccording to the country of origin, e.g. Colonial cottons&quot;have been bought on long term contracts;    Brazilian, Peruvianand Egyptian cottons have been bought direct by Cotton Controlrepresentatives on the spot.Merchants are used for the purchase of cotton for the U.K.,only in the case of Indian and to a limited extent american cotton.    They may engage in sales from one overseas countryto another, but so far such business has been very small.They have been employed by the Control as agents for thedistribution of Control purchases to spinners, and have themselves operated a care and maintenance scheme, designedto maintain a skeleton structure of most pre-war firms.4.      The prices paid have differed very widely from one country to  mother and have been undoubtedly much below thosewhich could have been obtained under private purchase under

war-time conditions.    This has been because the Control,buying on a rising market, has been able to take a longview and make large purchases well in advance, and because it has been possible in some cases to co-operate with otherbuyers to keep prices at a reasonable level and in other cases to enter into long term contracts upon advantageous terms.    Until April, 1944, the Control maintained astabilised schedule of issue prices,   irrespective of rising costs,  in which the prices for different types of cottonwere &quot;based cn the relative values to spinners.    Since 1944,though the differentials have been maintained, the Controlschedule of issue prices has been calculated to coveraverage overall cost, apart from certain abnormal charges.Since the Control holds large stocks of cheap cotton,  issueprices are well below present world market levels.    TheControl has operated a cover scheme which has protectedspinners against changes in Control issue prices.    Statutorymargins are fixed for yarn and cloth, and the Board of Tradeoperates a subsidy scheme at the cloth stage designed tosecure stability of the prices of Utility cloths at approxi-mately the 1942 level.5.     Any very early return to importation on private account would involve such sudden adjustments of prices to spinners -to make them- correspond to the disparate prices which have established themselves in the countries of origin for corn-parable cottons under wartime conditions - that great difficulties would be caused to spinners,  and moreover,  the flow of supplies to this country might be adversely affected.It is clear,  therefore,  that an early and complete returnto private import could not be contemplated,  and that theprocess of such return would have to be spread over a year or more.It is, however,  a matter of immediate urgency to decide in principle whether or net a system of private importationshould be restored as soon as circumstances will allow.While uncertainty on this point continues, neither theControl nor merchants can plan their staffing arrangementssatisfactorily.    In more precise terms,  it is necessary nowto be clear whether during the next year the functions ofmerchants in the purchase of cotton as agents on behalf ofthe Control should be extended in preparation for a return,to private purchase and whether preparations should be made   .for&apos;re-opening the Liverpool market and for an overhaul ofits rules and arrangements to bring operations into con-fortuity with the requirements of the &quot;Exchange Control andto prevent excesses of speculation;    or whether the control should continue and strengthen, its existing organisation in order to prepare the way for setting up a strong and independent Buying Commission.6.      Memoranda have been submitted to the President of theBoard of Trade by the Liverpool and Manchester CottonAssociations and by the Federation of Master CottonSpinners&apos; Associations, presenting u case for a return tothe pre-war structure of raw cotton purchase.    The CottonController has submitted proposals under which the existing

arrangements for centralised purchase could he modified to suit post-war conditions and continue under the supervision of a semi-public Gotten Commission.The Federation of Master Cotton Spinners has summarised the requirements of the industry as  (a)  the spinner must heable to obtain the exact growth,  gra.de and staple herequires when he deems it expedient to buy;    (b) he mustbe able to cover his requirements for many months ahead inthe qualities which suit his machinery;    (c) he must havethe facility to fix the price of the necessary raw cottonsupplies at the point of time when he contracts to make asale of yarn, arid to protect himself against changes inthe value of his stocks.The Cotton associations rest their case for a returnto the pre-war structure on the financial and generalpoints set out in paragraph-10(a) and (b) below, and astatement of the advantages to the industry of the existencein Liverpool of large spot stocks and the insurance faci-facilities provided by the organised market,  stressing parti-cularly the advantages thereby obtained for the export tradein cotton goods.7,      The Cotton Controller&apos;s proposals are summarised in annex A.    Briefly he proposes to establish a permanentCotton Commission using as a nucleus the Raw Cotton Setticnof the present control.    The Commission would include miemberswith experience of spinning and large-scale merchanting andwould be in the closest contact with industry.The Commission would aim at maintaining well-balancedstocks in the U.K. so as to give spinners a wide range of choice.    Selling prices, designed to cover average costsover a period, would be changed infrequently.    The existing&quot;cover&quot;  scheme would be extended to provide full cover forthe spinner against a change in the price of any growth orvariety after he had entered into a commitment to&apos; sellyarn;    ana this with provision for weavers and merchantsconvertors to cover their unsold stocks of cloth, wouldmake hedging transactions unnecessary.    The method of purchase abroad would vary - in some cases long-term con-tracts might be used;    in others,, buying through BranchOffices in countries of origin;    or purchases might be madein suitable circumstances by receiving cabled offers  inthe U.K.These proposals have been carefully designed in sucha way as to meet the requirements of the industry as setout by the Federation (paragraph 6 above) and to securethe advantages in buying policy which might be obtained froma fuller knowledge of the whole requirements of theindustry than is available to individual merchants in a market.8.      The following arguments  can. be advanced in favour ofsuch a scheme as that put forward by the Cotton Controller.(i) The pre-war arrangements for importation bymerchants were subject to&quot;a considerable amount of criticism.    It was alleged that there was undue

speculation, that merchants obtained excessive profitsby sorting and selection of cotton sold to spinners,and that the accepted form of futures contract being based upon the predominance of American cotton wasvery unsuited to the circumstances of the late &quot;thirties&quot;,when Brazilian, Colonial and other new growths of cottonwere growing in popularity.    A scheme of centralisedpurchases en the lines suggested by the Cotton Controllerwould meet these criticisms.(ii) There must be also some doubt whether world conditions will favour the operation of a free futuresmarket of pre-war type.    Governments of major supplying countries are -Likely to make a determined stand forschemes of price maintenance and control, and it ispossible that world cotton prices will be subject,  ifnot to international control,  at least to essentiallynon-commercial influences for a considerable time tocome.    There are also indications that in many Europeanbuying countries the purchase of cotton will be subjectto Government control and possibly centralised purchase.It is possible also that there will be internationalarrangement for regulating cotton production;  and while there are many obstacles in the way of agreement theUnited Kingdom and. the United States -are under an obligation to seek such agreement on the lines ofSection V of the &quot;proposals for am Intermitional TradeConference&quot; (Cd. 6709)  if a burdensome surplus cf cotton,should emerge.    If achieved on this basis,  an &quot;inter-national regulation scheme should mitigate the instabi-lity of world prices as experienced in a free market and to this extent at least would deprive the latter&apos;smajor service of the &quot;futures market&quot; of much of itsraison d&apos;etre.(iii) The adoption of centralised buying arrangements would also facilitate price stabilisation.    At presentthe prices of yarns and cloth are controlled and theUtility cloth scheme in cotton is an important part of present cost of living policy.    Even with a subsidy itwould be administratively difficult to operate measuresto secure stability of Utility cloth prices if pricesof raw cotton and. consequently of yarn and cloth.werechanging from day to day.    Prom the spinners1  standpoint,there is much to be said for centralised purchase in preference to individual buying on a free market in thatit would tend to secure to them what they most desire -namely, stability of price over a reasonable period.This stability combined, with an extended cover schemeof the type described in paragraph 7 should providespinners, and consequently weavers and other producersall along the line, with the most favourable conditionsin which to work.    The question of doubt, is whether,under such a scheme, spinners would on the average be receiving their raw material at as cheap a price as their competitors overseas,

(iv) Buying by the Cotton Control during the War hasclearly been successful;    prime facie this is an argument in favour of continuing centralised purchase.9.     These are powerful arguments.    They can, however, be balanced by arguments on the ether side.(i) We think that the criticisms of the pre-war market   .referred to above were, to a considerable extent,  justified.It is not, however,  to be assumed that they are not en thewhole remediable by reform of the market itself.(ii) The argument as to the influence upon world cotton prices of international control or, alternatively, of non-commercial and Governmental influence, cuts both ways.    Itis certainly possible that the institution of a strongcentralised buying organisation in this country would itself stimulate the development of similar sellingorganisations by Governments, or possibly combinationscf producers all supported by their Governments.    Thiswould, not necessarily be to our advantage.In any case the institution of some international control scheme &quot;would not necessarily be inconsistent withprocurement by private merchants,  though in such a casethe futures market would not bulk so largely among theactivities of the private market.There is also the wider issue of international commercial policy.    A free market for cotton would fit in better with a situation in which there are multilateral trade arrangements and fewer restrictions on the flow ofinternational trade.    The efficiency of the market wouldbe greatest in these circumstances.(iii) The argument as to price stabilisation and control is a powerful one.    It must, however, be set alongside the overriding necessity that the textile industry in thiscountry must be able to secure its raw material at the cheapest &quot;possible price, particularly from the point ofview of export and should not even over short periodshave to pay mere than its overseas competitors.    Thesetwo major considerations cannot easily be reconciled, butwe consider that a system of private import could be madeto square with the maintenance of stable prices forutility goods, provided that we are prepared to considerthe application of a fluctuating subsidy at some suitablepoint in the manufacturing chain and can service an admini-strative procedure tc this end. This view is subject tothe proviso that the stability of prices of utility goodsis not made to cover too long a period.    However, as mentioned below in (iv), we do not expect raw cotton prices, to rise after the re-establishment of the market and this serious problem of price stability would notarise under conditions of falling prices.

However, as mentioned below in (iv) , we do not expect raw cotton prices, to rise after the re-establishment of the market and this serious problem of price stability would notarise under conditions of falling prices.

(iv)    The successful experience of centralised purchaseduring the war does not provide any conclusive evidence thatcentralised purchasing would he as cheap and efficient inthe new conditions which we have now to face.      Luring the war there was a continual rising price trend, which made stocking-up profitable, and gave an advantage to the strong buyer,it was possible also to co-operate with other buying countries to keep prices below the competitive level while, at thesame time it was possible to discriminate in price betweenpurchases from different sources.      These conditions are unlikely to persist for cotton.      Sooner or later the pricetrend will be reversed and, under conditions of fallingprices, the control buying organisation might well be lossable to impose the necessary drastic re-adjustment of sellingand buying prices which could, be achieved by the operationof a private market.      The central organisation, though itmight well be loss in numbers than the total of persons em-ployed in the pro-war market, might be expected to suffer from a lack of flexibility and from a comparative slownessof action as compared with -the private -merchant operatingat his own risk.     Moreover,  such an organisation would almost certainly be more exposed than the private market toGovernmental pressures from producing countries.10. These arguments apart, it is necessary to consider certain general questions the first three which have been much stressedby the advocates of a return to private purchase-.(a) The existence of the Liverpool cotton market contri-buted to the general habit of conducting international commodity business in terras of sterling and along with Vacother commodity markets formed an important part of theinternational sterling system.      The Treasury and the Bankof England attach importance to this and it is their viewthat a free cotton market could be made compatible with ex-change control.(b) The&apos; Liverpool cotton market was a considerable earnerof foreign exchange.      There was a limited entrepot, tradeand considerable sums were earned on commissions and arbi-trage transactions on international business.      Accuratestatistics are not available, but the foreign exchangeaccruing before the War from commissions on &quot;futures1&apos; deals,miscellaneous arbitrative ana other business, mercantileprofits on trade between foreign countries not touching ourshores, and from the re-export trade may have been between 350,000 and  500,000.      To this must be added a substantialbut indeterminate sum on account of &quot;freights, insurance, andbanker&apos;s earnings resulting indirectly from the existence ofa    cotton market and of private import of cotton in thiscountry. *It is unlikely that under centralised purchase itwould bo possible to retain more than a limited proportionof this international business.(c) The Cotton merchants and brokers gave employment which&apos; may have amounted to about 2,500 persons engaged in the mer-chanting business proper, apart from U-5,000 more engaged inwarehouse handling, etc. .    whose employment would be necessary under either centralised&apos;or private purchase.      The merchantfirms have,  of course,  obligations to members of their staffsreturning-from the Forces.

(a)    Colonial Cottons.      tjurins the war the purchase ofcotton in Nigeria, Uganda, and the Sudan has &quot;boon carriedthrougn under long-torn agreements at prices union &quot;color/ thosewhich have to be paid for comonrablo cottons elsewhere.      It  -appear.:, -however, that asyconsldorablo expansion of Colonialv   cotton production would required the assistance of long-term contracts.      Since those cottons form quite a substantial proportion of the total supolios of certain types, long-term contracts in a free market ..ould present some serious, &quot;thoughprobably not insuperable difficulties.On&quot;the general financial and balance of payment ouostionsreferred to in this paragraph, our view is that while therewould probably be some loss if we adopted a system of centra-lijod buying, too loos could not be held to be significantfrom the point of view of foreign exchange or the&quot;generalwell-being of the international sterling system.11.    The question of method of purchase,  however, to beconsidered in a. wider context for much may depend upon the futureform of organisation of the spinning industry, which is at presentthe subject of consideration by the Cotton working party.      &quot;ghileboth methods discussed above are compatible with the existing organisation of the industry, the suitability of centralisedpurchase would be greater if in future the industry were to con-sist of many fewer unit s:.      Such indications as we have had leadus to suppose that any rationalisation of the spinning industryis not likely to result in cuoh a diminution in the number of&quot;unit.:, as would materially affect the question&apos;of the method ofprocurement.12.    It is extremely difficult at the present time to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of methods of purchase of raw cotton to be applied say one or two years hence.      No no-1 he-lees,it ie worth re-emphasizing that the continuance of uncertaintyis itself and. evil.      If a decision were taken now to treat cen-tralised purchase as a permanent feature, the existing controlarrangement   could be modified smoothly so as to operate at its maximum efficiency by the time a clear post-war pattern for world market had developed.      (Certain organisational questions,connected with this are dealt with in Annex B.) -Alternatively,  if it were decided now that private purchasecould be resumed later the functions of the existing merchantfirms could be somewhat enlarged immediately and they could re-engage staff and lay their plans accordingly.      If no decision is taken,  there is serious danger that on the one side the CottonControl Organisation will dwindle through lo-ss of staff-seeking^more permanent employment, while at the same time many merchant firmswill go out of business and preparations,  such as a new form&apos;offutures contract, will not be undertaken-, which would be abso-lutely necessary if a cotton futures market is to bo re-openedand to operate efficiently.13.    Conclusion-The Committee is of the opinion that in present circumstances the- over-riding need of this country is an adequate supply ofcotton of the right grades and qualities and at the cheapest possibleprice.     The re-ostablishment of the cotton export  trade is of paramount importance:    and if that aim is to be achieved wecannot afford to be at any handicap or disadvantage as compared

with foreign textile producers in the matter of qualityor of price.Bearing this in mind, the Committee has tried to make an objective assessment of the economic advantages of the two methodsof purchase.      It will bo clear from what has already been said thatthere is room for argument for and against each of the alterna-tlvos of a return to a free market or a continuation of some form of centralised purchase.     There are risks either way, and responsible opinions both inside and outside the industry differon the economic merits of the two methods.      The Committee, forits part, feels that the arguments are extremely evenly balanced,and that it is not possible to be dogmatic upon the subject.There are,  however, two general considerations, to which, in theopinion of the Committee,  great weight should be given.(a) It would without doubt be a matter of&quot; difficulty now tore-establish the market and subsequently to close it.     Nevor-theless this would be feasible should the...market turnout to be unsatisfactory when operating under the new world conditions which we cannot yet foresee.      There must be some risk of this having regard to the profound changes broughtabout by the war or likely to be the outcome of the after-math of War.On the other hand, the re-establishment of the marketat some future date after a full-scale experiment in centra-lised purchase would almost certainly be impossible.      Bornemerchants might be able to continue in business (e.g.    assellers&apos;  agents);    but the market organisation, as a whole,would have been disrupted in the meantime, and it is wellnighinconceivable that it could be effectively re-established.For this reason, in a situation of a considerable tin-certainty as to the course of future world trade, wo. thinkthat a return to private importation gives us the greater freedom to decide in the light of experience:    and that accor-dingly the unus of proof lies upon the advocates of centra-Used purchase rather than on the advocates of a return tothe private market system.(b) We have referred in paragraph 9 (ii) to the danger ofpolitical pressures and non-commercial influences being broughtto bear upon a central buying organisation by producing countries or groups of producing countries.     Wo think thatthis is a very real and practical danger to cheap imports.Any centralised buying institution,  even though it may not be formally a Government institution, waist clearly be to a largeextent under Government influence if not control.      Pressuresexerted by the Governments&apos; of producing countries on theGovernment of the importing country is extremely likely to lead to adjustments in purchase prices which doubtless wouldhave strong political justification but would run counter to our present prime need of the cheapest possible raw material.This factor would not present quite the some danger ifwe were to reach an international &quot;commodity agreement forcotton, which would probably maintain prices equally foreverybody.      But no reliance can be placed on our ability to roach such an agreement.

1k.    Recommendation---Bearing those considerations in mind, the majority of theCommittee take the view that a conclusive co.se has not beenmade for a decision to institute centralised buying arrangementsor to abolish the Liverpool cotton market.      Wo recommend thatit should now be in&apos;.imntod to the market that it is the Govern-ment intention to re-establish private trading as soon ascirctmistanoes permit.     At the same time it shou.ld&apos; be made clearthat the Government will expect the market to co-operate in measures designed to secure that the market operates at thehighest degree of efficiency, restricts speculation and co-operates in a scheme which would reconcile the needs of a freemarket witli effective exchange control.Representatives of the Treasury, while they do not dissent from the general arguments of the Report,  take the view that,so far as their departmental interest is concerned (balance ofpayments, exchequer risks,  stabilisation policy)  the position could be adequately safeguarded under either method of procure-ment.      They do not feel entitled in these circumstances toexpress a positive opinion one way or the other.(Signed)    J.H. WO ODSon behalf of the Committee.

ANNEX   A.Cotton Controller1s Proposalsfor CentralisedPurchaseThe Cotton Controller suggests that the Raw CottonSection of the present Control should form the nucleus ofa^permanent Cotton Commission, which should include members with experience of spinning and large scale merchanting, withan economist and a chartered accountant.     In addition to abuying staff overseas, it would employ some full-time classers.Such an organisation could secure adeauate knowledge andcontact with the industry, while being able to take large andindepedent views of the supply and demand for raw cttton, onthe basis of full statistical information and day to dayworking experience both of the world position and therequirements of the British industry.The Commission would aim at maintaining a stock in thiscountry not less in total, and in general better-balanced,than that which was held by merchants before the War;    spinnerswould be given the option of buying from the Commission either by description, as at present, or after sampling *r selectionby them or by their brokers;    but in the latter case an extracharge would be mad.e to cover the costs involved.      TheCommission would, thus provide the spinners with a wide range of choice of growth, grade and staple.The Cornmissiorfs selling prices, designed to cover averagetests over a period, would be kept fairly flexible, but wouldnot be subject to changes from day to day.     The existingcover scheme would be extended to provide full cover againsta change in the price of any growth or major variety;    and provision could also be made whereby weavers and merchant *.converters would   eover their unsold stocks of rloth also withthe Commission.      This extended cover scheme would, as far asthe industry is concerned, replace the pre-war futures market and make hedging transactions unnecessary.      Special orunusual facilities could be given on payment of an appropriate charge.As to the methods of purchase by the Commission, theController suggests that purposes chase by long-torm arrangement with one Government or other central authority in the producingeountry has many advantages in the elimination tf handling -charges and intermediate profits, and should be applied whereuossible - as for example, in the Colonies, Sudan, and theArgentine.      Purchases&quot;through a Branch organisation opened in &quot;the country of origin would be appropriate where purchasesare to be large and regular (o.g. Brazil, Egypt).     Purchasesmight be made through a buying broker in the country ef originwhere purchases are *n a smaller scale (e.g. Peru).     Purchasesmight be made in suitable circumstances by receiving cabledoffers in the U..K.

The technical services have been supplied in part by members of the cotton trade who have become temporary Civil Servants and in part by using as agentsfirms normally engaged in the raw cotton trade as principals.Within the limits imposed by availability of supplies and shipping, the Ministry with the advice of the Control have endeavoured to secure cotton of the kinds best suited to thewartime needs of the cotton industry, but the industry has hadto take the cottons which wore available for it.      Similarly,the Ministry have endeavoured to take account of price inmaking their purchases,  and on a rising market have purchasedwell, but purchase price could bo only one among a number.of considerations.      Moreover, the selling prieo of the differentvarieties of cotton to the spinner has not been precisely or indeed closely related to the purchase price.From the long-term post-war point of view, it will benecessary to pay much more attention to ensuring that the spinners shall secure the varieties of Gotten in the proportionswhich arc moot suited to them,  and that the cost to the spinnershall be  as favourable as possible in relation to the coot tospinners in other parts of the world.      It would bo necessarythat the buying organisation should have within itself high-general and specialised ability in relation to the purchase ofcotton from the various countries of origin, and that itshould have the discretion and flexibility to act promptly andto the best advantage.      The task will not be one for a bodyorganised and conducted on Civil Service lines, but will need a Oommission organised and staffed upon a csmmereial basis.It would also need to bo as close as possible to the spinnersand to have a current familiarity and response to their needs.On the other hand it is by no means cloar yet how far the  sale of cotton from the countries of origin vail be influenced or  controlled by the Governments of those countries.Certainly the existence of a single buyer in this country close to the British Government will encourage the introduction ofextraneous economic and political considerations into thebusiness ef selling and buying *otton.    . This tendency will need to be discouraged as much as possible if the best interestsof the cotton industry arc to be served.The two possible methods of centralised purchase ofcotton are that it should bo done by an organisation whichis the om-an of the Government or by one which is operated by the spinners, subject to such degree of Government control^*na financial guarantee as-may bo necessary.
