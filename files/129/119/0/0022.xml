C.(64) 223Oth November, 1964COPY NO.cabinet general GRANTS TO LOCAL AUTHORITIESM em or andum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury the Minister of Housing and Local Government sent me acopy of his new proposals in C. (64) 21 j but they have not beendiscussed with the Treasury.    They raise an important issue of priorities in public expenditure which might well have been considered at the Public Sector Programmes Committee and cannot properly be settled piecemeal.2.       The point at issue is the grant for 1966-67.    The Ministerspaper does not claim that the two-yearly determination of grant isunfair; the facts would not support this.    It is claimed that this time it is unfair, for the local authorities, drawing up expenditure estimates for 1966-67 in the summer, could not take into account the improve-ments that this Government v/ould encourage them to make withinpresent legislation (if new legislation imposed new obligations on localauthorities, the general grant could be adjusted).3.       The Minister proposes, therefore, that  20 million should beadded to the figures which emerged from the Departments&apos; examinationof the local authority figures (an extra  11 million on the Exchequer).This would&apos;bring the general grant figure, which this year will be 619 million, up to  678 million in 1965-66 and  727 million in 1966-67,plus pay and price increases which we know will be substantial(possibly  35 million in grant in the first year (1965-66) and of coursemuch more in the second).4.       This in effect decides the rate of growth of social expenditure by local authorities, and in particular on education and health, whichare the big items.    The forward estimates that we found when v/e came into office were equivalent to increases of 5-1 per cent a year, in real terms, for local authorities1 relevant expenditure.    We know thatthese estimates were based on an increase of 4 per cent per year ingross national product; and that even so they would probably have involved increases in rates of taxation.    We know also that we certainlycannot rely on increases of 4 per cent in each of the next two years -the Plan for National Development is being based on getting up to a4 per cent growth rate as soon as possible, which is a very different matter.-1-
5.       The estimates of local authority relevant expenditure agreed with Departments envisaged 6. 7 per cent (not 5-j per cent) increasein the first year, and 5. 6 per cent in the second.    I agreed underpressure.    The Minister now.would raise the second year to7. 3 per cent, consolidating a further and no doubt cumulativeacceleration.6.       Even in the previous Governments expenditure estimates weare over-committed.    We have given pensions and prescription charges priority.    We have not yet taken the basic decisions to contain defence expenditure.    We have not yet cleared the course for solving our most critical economic problems.    I am sure weshould not decide, without any comparison of the priorities andchoices, to allocate an additional  20 million to these services for1966-67.J. D.Treasury  Chambers, S. W. 1.30th November, 1964-2-
