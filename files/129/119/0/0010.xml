There is one problem on which I think we can take early actionof this kind.    The concentration of office development in London is amain cause of regional imbalance, ties up resources which would bebetter used for other purposes and adds to the congestion in thecapital.    The Minister of Housing, the President of the Board ofTrade and I are agreed that drastic measures are required to controlnew offices in and around London.    Our objective would be to steeras much of it as is practicable right outside the South-East.3.      We consider that the most effective way of proceeding wouldbe to make new office development subject to control, broadly on thelines of the i. d. c.*control which the Board of Trade already exerciseover industrial building, starting with the Metropolitan Region.   Thiswould, of course, require legislation which I would hope to introducebefore Christmas,4.      If my colleagues agree, I would propose to make a statement about this during the debate on the Address next week,    I should liketo couple with the announcement of our intention to introduce the newcontrols a positive reference to the need to encourage office develop-rnent in other regions;  and it would be important to assure thebuilding industry that the new measures would not mean any reduction in the total demand for which they would have to cater,5,      I attach a draft statement together with an explanatory note which have been prepared by officials at my request.    The statementmay need some rearrangement particularly on paragraphs 8 to 10 tobring out more strongly that it is the London conurbation on whichthe control will bite hardest first,6.      I hope my colleagues will agree that I should make a state-ment on this matter during the debate on the Address,G.B.Department of Economic Affairs, S,W. 1.30th October, 1964* industrial development certificateTOP SECRET
DRAFT STATEMENTWe have promised a system of comprehensive regional planning directed to providing a fresh social environment in keeping with the needs and aspirations of the time.2.       The Government&apos;s first action in this field is designed to check the continued growth of offices in South-East England,especially in London, and thus to relieve congestion, reduce the pressure on resources, and secux-e a better distribution ofemployment.3.       South-East England, with about one-third of Great Britain&apos;s.population, has accounted for over half of the total increase inemployees over the past decade or so.    About three-quarters ofSouth-East employment growth occurred within the metropolitan region.4.       There is little prospect of housing adequately inside Londonmore than the 8 million people who live there at present, yetemployment in London has been increasing at a rate of over 40, 000a year.    Office growth has been the main cause, and this has, until recently, been largely concentrated in or adjoining Central Londonand has resulted in nearly 200, 000 more office jobs there since 1951.5.      Outstanding planning permissions together with existing userights under the Third Schedule of the Town and Country PlanningActs could result in over a quarter of a million further office job s inLondon, half of them in Central London.    The road and rail systeminto London is already severely congested, and we cannot afford theheavy capital investment on new works which would be necessary to cope with the journey-to-work pressures resulting from this additional office employment,6.      So we have to call a halt to this rapid growth, with all theconsequences which it has for the nation.    We shall be examiningwith the Greater London Council the whole employment situation inLondon in relation to housing, transport and other services in orderto determine what level of office employment is acceptable in thelong-term.-1-
7,      First we must have a standstill on new offices in London.To this end, the Government will shortly be introducing a Billunder which, in stated areas, any new offices v/ill require fromthe Board of Trade Office Development Permits in addition to thenormal planning permission.    Permits will be required for bothnew building and change of use.8.      The Bill will provide for areas to be designated as the needarises.    The intention is to designate, in the first instance, theLondon Metropolitan Region (i. e. the area roughly within 40 miles of Charing Cross).    For this Region the Bill will have retrospectiveeffect from to-day [5J November.9.       The control will be applied with particular stringency inthe London conurbation (the area defined by the Registrar general for Census purposes).    In general no permits will be granted hereexcept in very special circumstances.    Permits for new buildingswill be required even if planning permission has been given, unless a contract to build has been entered into before  .6^/ November.Permits will also be required in the case of change of use, unlessplanning permission has been given before  7^.-/ November.10.      In the rest of the Metropolitan Region a permit will berequired for new office building or change of use of existing buildings to offices in all cases where planning permission has notbeen given before November /j&amp;J ,11,      Compensation will not be payable where a permit iswithheld,12.      Powers will be taken to exempt from the control offices of less than a certain size.    Within the London conurbation it isintended that buildings of less than  &quot;      JW sq..ft. shouldinitially be exempt.    For the rest of the Metropolitan Region thefigure will be ^      -/ sq. ft.13.      Outside the South-Fast, offices can make a valuable contribution to the economic strength and balance of employmentin the regions.    We propose therefore to commission comprehensivestudies designed to throw light on the scope for moving offices rightoutside the South-East, and on the considerations which should govern their location in other parts of the country,-2-
14,      The new controls, while they will relieve pressure on certain congested areas, will not reduce the total demand on theconstruction industry.    The Governments policy is to promote the rapid expansion of this key industry, so that the nation&apos;sessential social and economic needs can be met.30th October, 1964-3-
NOTE BY OFFICIALSMinisters will wish to bear the following points in mind.Territorial Coverage2.      We assume that the Bill will confer power to control office development on a countrywide basis, by designating particular areas as need arises.3.      It will be necessary, however, to say in the statement whichareas will be immediately affected.    To confine control to theLondon conurbation only would probably result in a flood of applications for office development on the periphery.    On the otherhand, we suggest that it would be premature to apply the control to the whole of the South-Eact from 5th November, with all that is involved in retrospective effect (see paragraphs 6 to 10),    Theproposal therefore is that the control should apply immediately tothe Metropolitan Region (roughly an area of 40 miles from thecentre of London).    Other areas, e.g. the rest of the South-East,can be covered by Orders under the Bill.Office Floor Space4,       It is proposed that the control should apply to all officefloor space, not just office buildings.    This will be necessary toprevent evasion, e.g. by the erection of an &quot;industrial building&quot;with a large office floor space attached.Change of Use5.      It will be necessary that the powers apply not only to new building but also to the change of use of, say, houses or hotels tooffices.General Retrospective Effect6.      It is proposed that the control take the form of an office development Permit (issued by the Board of Trade).    In order toprevent forestalling, it will be necessary to make retrospectivethe need for a Permit in the Metropolitan Region so as to cover any planning applications for office development which areoutstanding at the time of the statement, or are made between thetime of the statement and the passing of the legislation.    Therewill no doubt be criticism of the propriety of retrospectivelegislation of this type.Special Provision for the London Conurbation7.       Because of the serious situation in London, it is proposedthat, within the conurbation (i. e. out to the Green Belt), office development Permits should be required even for those new office buildings for which planning permission has already been given.The only exception to this rule would be where a building contract-4-
had been entered into, on or before that date.    Permits wouldnot, however, be required for changes of use which have receivedplanning permission before 6th November because the change iscommonly put into effect immediately after the grant of planning permission, and does not depend on any identifiable form of contract.8.      It is in the cases where the control will bite on existingplanning permissions that the pressure for compensation will bestrongest.Compensation9.      The draft statement says that no compensation will be paidwhere an Office Development Permit is withheld.    No difficultyarises as regards new development (as distinct from rebuilding)for which no planning permission exists at the appointed day.   Theapplicant who fails to get a permit is in precisely the same positionas the indstrialist who is refused an industrial developmentcertificate.    There has never been any question of payingcompensation for i.d. c. refusals.10.      It will, however, be said that in relation to existingplanning permissions withholding of a permit is tantamount torevocation of the permission and that, therefore, compensation should be paid as provided for in the Town and Country PlanningActs.    This means paying full market value, including development value.    Very large sums of money are involved and there will be extremely strong pressure for compensation.    Nor is it only aquestion of development value.    Most of the land concerned enjoysexisting use rights under the Third Schedule to the Town and country Planning Act, 1962.    To withhold compensation in suchcases would be an entirely novel proposal and would be represented as retrospective legislation at its worst.11.     On the other hand, withholding of compensation can be defended if the Office Development Permit is regarded as only atemporary stop on development.    This in fact is likely to be theposition.    Most of the office development now in the pipeline willprobably have to be allowed eventually in order to provide for replacement of old premises, improvement of space standards and greater all-round efficiency.    The crucial issue is timing;  thenew development cannot be allowed to go ahead until the review ofthe Greater London employment situation has been carried out and improvements undertaken.Duration of Powers12.      There is a dilemma here.    If the control is represented as temporary, this will encourage firms to mark time.    On the otherhand, the more it is represented as permanent, the greater willbe the pressure for compensation.    The draft statement is notspecific on duration beca.use of this dilemma.    But it will benecessary to take a view when legislation is being drafted,-5-TOP SECKET
Exemptions13,      It will be highly desirable to have a lower exemption limitin order to avoid applications for small off ice s providing a purely local service.    The level could be uniform throughout theMetropolitan Region or alter natively a lower limit could be applied in the conurbation than in the rest of the Metropolitan Region,    on balance, we consider that it would be more defensible to have a uniform exemption through the Metropolitan Region and that thisshould be fixed at 2,000 sq, ft.    On present practice, an office areaof this size would employ about 15 to 20 people.Crown Buildings14.      There would be pressure for the same degree of restraintto be exercised in relation to Government offices and it istherefore for consideration whether the control should apply to crown buildings.-6-
