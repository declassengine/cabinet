epNFJPENTIALPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1964C. (64) 25 Copy No.9th December, 1964CABINETSOUTHERN RHODESIA: MISSION OF PRIVY COUNCILLORSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for CommonwealthRelationsMinisters have given some thought to the possibility that acommittee of Privy Councillors might visit Southern Rhodesia, in anattempt to conciliate the extreme views now held by the two sides.2. I see advantage in pursuing this idea. It would help to resolvethe deadlock if Mr. Smith continues to be reluctant to come here fortalks. It would represent a useful new initiative on our part; it shouldhave considerable presentational value both here and in the united nations; it would buy us a certain amount of time; and it wouldalso serve to emphasise the importance attached by Parliament tothis problem, and the bi-partisan approach to it here.3. There are partial precedents for such a mission. Parliamentarydelegations have visited dependent territories, e.g., to India early in1946 and to Kenya in 1954. They were mostly composed of non-PrivyCouncillors and were not led by Ministers. The Cripps Mission toIndia in 1946 was solely composed of members of the Government.A Commission of three Privy Councillors was sent to Uganda earlyin 1962 to advise on the &quot; lost counties&quot; problem. In the light ofthese precedents we could consider a mission composed either ofPrivy Councillors or of any Parliamentarians.4. In this instance, I would not recommend commonwealth membership of the mission. Mr. Smith would not agree to receive a delegation with a Commonwealth label; and it would be difficult for us to insist on it in view of the recognition by all commonwealth prime Ministers last July that the authority and responsibility forleading our remaining Colonies to independence must continue torest with us. The Monckton Commission included a Canadian andan Australian, but it would now be necessary to include an Africanif the delegation were to be given a Commonwealth flavour: and none of the African Privy Councillors (the President of Ghana, andthe Governor-General, Prime Minister and Chief Justice of Nigeria)5139
mseem both suitable and available; Moreover, on the monckton commission analogy, we should have to consider including SouthernRhodesia members in the team, which would not be appropriate.5.  I suggest the following arrangements for consideration by my colleagues:(i) Composition. A mission composed of two Labour members(not in the Government), one Conservative and oneLiberal might be appointed. Even if all of them are notto be Privy Councillors, the leader probably should be.(ii) Terms of Reference-No detailed terms seem necessarybeyond saying that the committee is &quot; to visit SouthernRhodesia &quot;. It should not be described as a &quot;constitutional commission &quot;, because Mr. Smith could not then accept it without conceding the necessity for constitutional change prior to independence, and this he could not dowithout losing face locally. (The Parliamentary mission to Kenya had no further terms of reference than &quot; to seethings for themselves &quot; and the Parliamentary Mission toIndia was formed so that &quot; members of our ownParliament should have an opportunity to meet leadingpolitical Indian personalities, to learn their own views atfirst hand &quot;).(iii) Report.-The mission should report to myself in the firstinstance and there should be no advance commitment asregards a public report to Parliament: that would be amatter for the Government to decide after discussionwith the members on their return. (The ParliamentaryMission to India produced no written report. The missionsto Kenya and Uganda produced public reports).(iv) Procedure and Timing(a) It would first be necessary to approach the Leader ofthe Opposition and Mr. Grimond. If they were willing to co-operate, the proposal should then beput confidentially to Mr. Smith.(b) By this next week-end, Mr. Smith Will have had thePrime Minister&apos;? last message for about a fortnight.If he has not by then agreed to come to London,we should immediately put this alternativesuggestion to him.(c) It may be difficult to persuade Mr. Smith to agree toreceive the mission. It would, for example, makeit difficult for him to declare independenceunilaterally until it had come and gone. The pointcan, however, be put to him that he has himselfcriticised us for falling into what he calls &quot;thepitfalls of long-range judgments&quot;, and that the
mission will enable Parliament to obtain first-handimpressions of Rhodesian opinion. He may try tostipulate in advance that the mission should not see African nationalists who are in gaol. If possible,the mission should be left to decide on the spotwhom it will see. On present form, the Rhodesianauthorities would apparently agree to its seeingNkomo, who is in restriction, but not Sithole, whois in gaol until February.A.
