CABINETTHE THREATENED DOCK strike memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department the Ministerial Committee on Emergencies have been givingpreliminary consideration to the emergency measures that would need to be taken by the Government in the event of the threatened national dock strike.2. Following a dispute over a wage claim, the unions havegiven notice of their intention to strike from 1st December. TheMinister of Labour has set up a Committee on Inquiry under thechairmanship of Lord Devlin with instructions to report first, and asa matter of urgency, on the question of wages and then to examinemore general issues. He hopes to receive their interim report on20th November or possibly a day or two earlier. The recommendationsof the report will then require negotiation between the employersand unions. The situation during the negotiations will be delicate,particularly in view of inter-union rivalry and the existence of militantunofficial leaders within the dockers&apos; ranks. The negotiations will notnecessarily lead to a settlement, although the strike date of1st December might be postponed in the course of them.3. It is essential to avoid any action which might be regardedas provocative and frustrate a peaceful settlement. At the same time it is the duty of the Government to make plans to maintain essential supplies in the event of the strike taking place. The purpose of this paper is to inform my colleagues of the measures which could betaken to that end, and of the limitations to which they are subject.4.   The steps which will be taken are:(a) the proclamation of a state of emergency under theEmergency Powers Acts, 1920 and 1964;(b) the use of troops.Proclamation of an emergency at the outset of the strike would bean indication of the Government^ resolution to take firm action and,by enabling emergency regulations to be made, would help5047THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

Departments to take emergency measures with the least delay. It isnot, however, legally necessary to proclaim an emergency beforetroops are used, and this has not always been done in previous strikes.Several factors limit the use of troops: the numbers that can be madeavailable without prejudicing operational requirements, the advancepreparations needed for their deployment, and the risk that the useof troops might cause a strike to spread.5. A national dock strike might well spread to other relatedemployment. Lightermen would almost certainly become involved,since they are members of the same National Joint Council as the dockers. Members of the Transport and General Workers Unionworking in London fruit and vegetable markets, as well as lorrydrivers carrying goods from the docks, would be likely to declare&quot; black &quot; any goods handled by troops. Further consequences, forexample on the railways, can only be guessed.6. The Ministry of Defence have made advance plans for theuse of troops in a dock strike, which they have carried as far as theycan without the further consultation referred to in paragraph 7 below.They plan to provide 33,700 servicemen with an additional 20 percent for administration. This number should suffice to unload essential supplies. If more troops should be required, the number availablecould be increased to 45,000 without touching the strategic reserve.The maximum that could be provided is 70,000, but the Army&apos;disability to meet unforeseen operational requirements would then be greatly prejudiced. But it is doubtful whether even the use of all available troops, together with any civilian help that might be enlisted,would be sufficient to cope with the serious situation that would arise if there were widespread industrial action in support of a dock strike.7. If the Government decided that troops should work in the docks, the Ministry of Defence would wish to begin preparatoryaction at least ten days beforehand. They would then consult unitsbelow Command level. Discussions with port authorities would follow six days, and finally movement of troops would begin three days, before the date on which work was to start. The consultations with port authorities could certainly not be kept secret, and evenconsultations within the Services below Command level might become known.8. The Ministerial Committee on Emergencies fully recognised the Government^ duty in the last resort to act to maintain essential supplies in the face of a dock strike, but they were in no doubt that meanwhile the overriding consideration must be to avoid any actionwhich might jeopardise the peaceful settlement of the dispute or causeit to spread. If troops were to be used on the first day of the strike,the first stage of the Service preparations (consultations belowCommand level) would coincide with the re-opening of negotiations between the two sides in the dispute, and such action should thereforebe authorised only after careful consideration. It might be necessaryto defer the more overt preparations until the strike had begun. Thiswould mean that unloading of ships would not begin for several daysthereafter. The consequent loss of perishable foodstuffs would
probably be small, although, when troops began work; they wouldbe faced with a backlog of unloaded cargoes and stocks of essentialfood might run down more rapidly than would otherwise happen.9. The Ministerial Committee on Emergencies will meet again,as necessary, in the light of the situation. Meanwhile I ask mycolleagues:(a) to take note of the emergency measures that may have to betaken in the event of a national dock strike, and inparticular of the difficulties of timing and the limits to theassistance which the Services can give;(b) to endorse the Committee&apos;s view that, while the government must, if necessary, act to maintain essential supplies, it isessential to avoid any preparations which, if they became known, might jeopardise negotiations for a settlement;(c) to give me discretion, when and if circumstances require itand after consultation with the Minister of Labour, toauthorise the Ministry of Defence to begin consultationwith Service units below Command level.F.
