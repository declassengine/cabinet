THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1964C. (64) 7 Copy No. : -5628th October, 1964 .. ;  :V        .... fcgF,CABINETQUEEN&apos;S SPEECH: PUBLIC EXPENDITURE -Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer asked my colleagues to let me know the increases in public expenditure in 1965-66 that they were considering, so that we couldlook at the priorities before settling The Queen&apos;s Speech. Fifteen ofthem replied, very clearly, and we have had a useful and helpfuldiscussion.2. First, we are working with the intention of a full period of office. We have made pledges that we intend to carry out. But it ismanifestly impossible to carry out more than a few of them in thefirst year; particularly when our first preoccupation must be to getthe economy right.3. Second, it is absolutely clear that the increases of expenditure which we incur must be matched by additional taxes. The natural:expansion of the revenue is fully absorbed, and probably more, by the increases of expenditure in the programmes which we have inherited.I hope we shall reshape these programmes, and increase some and reduce others. But this cannot happen very fast.4. Third, the economic situation and the righting of the balanceof payments are likely to call for more taxes, apart altogether fromthe taxes required to balance our proposals for new expenditure.,5. In The Queen&apos;s Speech, there are only two specific questions to decide:(i) national insurance (N.I.);(ii) abolition of prescription charges.6. But we must keep all the other claims in mind. We donot need to decide them yet; and some of them cannot yet bedecided. Many will be settled in the Estimates, and so on. We mustleave room for the most important of them.7. The proposals which we have discussed are in the Annex,shown as public sector expenditure (central and local government,N.I. Funds, etc.) and Exchequer. The difference, broadly speakingsis financed by local rates and N.I. contributions. Shifting. fromExchequer to contributions and vice versa does not really affect theburden. The severance pay ( 8-15 million) paid for by employersis rather similar.4996
8. We discussed the various points fully. My approach is to concentrate the maximum benefit on one single item and I think we are all agreed that the pensioners take pride of place. On theother hand the sum involved is so large that by selecting this oneitem I am forced to rule out a number Of other items. For example:(i) Transfer from local rates to taxes: this cannot now take effect in 1965-66. On the other hand, consistent with our desireto help the elderly, I should like to meet the Minister ofHealth&apos;s proposal to put the cost of old people&apos;s homes on general grant.(ii) This year we shall need to find ways of helping theowner-occupier other than by reducing interest rates. I amexploring other more indirect possibilities,(hi) In order to establish proper priorities, increases in publicservice construction in1,905-66jpdfor subsequent years should be considered in the ^fep^ee^^tfie Departmentof Economic Affairs wfekth is making asMl -ccvreay of the prospective load, private and public, on the construction industries, and their ability to meet it.9. The total cost of all the major proposals is  410-430 million,of which  217-238 million falls on the Exchequer, as follows:, ,   millionNational insurance (12s. 6d.)...... 126Prescription charges for medicines ... 22Transfer of old people&apos;s homes      ... 18&quot;Other&quot;       ...      ...     ....... 51-71217-23810. By way of illustration, an increase of 6d. a gallon on petrol and derv would raise  93 million of revenue. 6d. on cigarettes,2d. on beer and correspondingly on wine and spirits would raise 152 million.11. Two items which could represent substantial savings to offset part of the cost are savings on the subsidy to the railways and defence. The present railway subsidy is very considerable. consistent with our transport policy, which we outlined during the election, wemust secure a substantial saving from railway closures. As regardsdefence, I have not thought it right to take any credit at this stagefor possible savings, but I propose to enter into early discussions withthe Secretary of State for Defence about the best way of tackling this important sector of expenditure.12. To sum up, if reasonable room is to be left for the &quot; other &quot;items and at the same time an impossibly heavy tax bill is to be prevented, I must ask my colleagues to support me in the following proposals:(i) We should concentrate the maximum weight of theadditional expenditure on the National insurance benefits. On this basis I can see my way to a 10s. increasein benefits  representing an Exchequer payment  of
 90 million. The increased benefits would include the. abolition of the widows earnings rule and lifting the&quot; 10s. widow.&quot; up to 30s. The details of the contributions and division between employee and employer can be left for further discussion. .(ii) I adhere to the commitment to remove prescription charges and regard it as a high priority, but we cannot do it this;r::&apos;:.; session.  &apos;    . .      &apos;.(hi) I am ready to agree to the expenditure of  18 millioninvolved in the transfer of old people&apos;s homes from localauthorities to the Exchequer. ; ;L.

Alternative distributions would be possible.(2) The cost of severance pay estimated at  8-15 million a year, to be borne by employers. This would be equivalent to increased employers&apos; contribution.(3) Increases in hospital building and annual hospital running expenses of 6-7 million in 1966-67 and  12-14million a year in 1967-68, etc. (Englandand Wales),and increases in Scotland.(4) Further 5 per cent special pay increase in April 1966: Teacher trainingexpansion and other teacher supply cost: And additional university grants. these would involve increases (over and above the increase of about 6 per cent per annum in real terms provided in existing programmes) rising to perhaps  120 million a year.Broadly speaking something over 60 per cent of local authority education is financed by general grant and rate deficiency grant.(5) Minister of Overseas Development intends to review the aid programme,with the aim of working it up to, say,  220 million a year, compared with the present figure of about  195 million (1 per cent of G.N.P. is  265 million). This includesadditional  4 million a year for technical assistance. No estimate can yet be made ofthe additional expenditure which would take place in 1965-66; and the figures are shown in square brackets accordingly.(6) Items with relatively small financial implications which the Chief Secretary isdiscussing separately with the Ministers concerned.Total410-430217-238Notes:
