SECRET &apos; 6J)(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)50C. (64) 12 COPY NO.10th November,  1964CABINETREMUNERATION OF MINISTERS AND MEMBERS OFPARLIAMENTMemorandum by the Prime minister a copy is attached of the report of the Committee on the remuneration of Ministers and Members of Parliament.    This Committeewas appointed in December, 1963 after discussions between the main political parties.    It was asked to report as soon as possible after theGeneral Election, so that whatever action seemed appropriate in the lightof its report could then be taken without delay.2.       I think that the Committee&apos;s recommendations on the salaries and allowances of members of both Houses can be accepted and defended;   andthat the increases should be retrospective to the first day of the new parliament.3.       But it would be much more difficult to raise Ministerial salaries tothe levels recommended by the Committee,    Instead, they might in generalbe increased by 50 per cent above their present level, plus the revisedallowance for expenses payable to Members of Parliament.4.       I would not propose to accept any salary increase myself.5.       The effects of proposals on these lines on the main ministerial salaries are summarised in the Annex,     But we shall have to consider what should be done about the salaries of the Lord Chancellor and the LawOfficers;   and there may well be other anomalies.6.       We shall also need to consider whether we can accept the pensions scheme for Members of the House of Commons recommended by theCommittee,    My view is that we should accept it in principle, and certainly acceptance of the Committee&apos;s recommendation on salaries ofMembers of Parliament is based on the assumption that they will becontributing  150 a year to the pensions scheme.    However, the scheme has not been fully worked out by the Committee and the proposals raise anumber of difficulties which will require detailed consideration.    This andother outstanding points might be looked at by a small ministerial committee under the chairmanship of the Lord President of the Council.7.       It has already been announced, in the Gracious Speech, that theReport has been received.,    We ought, I think, to publish the Report and make a statement in the House early next week.    I would like the lord president and his Committee to prepare a draft.8.       We shall also have to consider the timing of the Resolutions on members&apos; pay and allowances and in particular whether they should wait for the introduction of legislation on Ministerial salaries and pensions for members.H.

REPORTofTHE COMMITTEE ON THE REMUNERATIONOFMINISTERS AM) MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENTTo The Right Honourable The Prime MinisterAPPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEE AND TERMS OF reference . Our appointment as a Committee and the matters which were toform the subject of our review and recommendations were announced bySir Alec Douglas-Home as Prime Minister in the following terms inthe House of Commons on the 19th December 1963 in reply to a question by you as Leader of the Opposition:-&quot;MR. H. WILSON (by Private Notice) asked the Prime minister if he will make a statement arising out of the discussions whichhave been held on the remuneration of Ministers and Members ofParliament.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER (Sir Alec Douglas-Home) :   Yes, Sir.   the remuneration of Members of the House of Commons and salaries of junior Ministers were raised in 1957* and, at the same time, anexpenses allowance was introduced for Members of the House of Lords.The basic salary of a senior Minister has remained unchangedsince 1831.&quot;After consultation with the leaders of the main political parties in both Houses, we have decided that the time has now come for a fundamental review of the remuneration of ministers of the Crown and of Members of the House of Commons and also for the reconsideration of the allowance for Members of the House of Lords.Hansard, 19th December 19^3, cols. 1441-42.1
&quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Government have, therefore, appointedSir Geoffrey Lawrence, Mr, H. S. Kirkaldy and professor W. J. M. Mackenzie to lie a Committee with thefollowing terms of reference:&apos;To review, and to recommend what changes are desirable in, the remuneration of Mr. Speaker, Ministers of the crown and Members of the House of Commons and also the allowance for members of the House of Lords, having regard to their responsibilities, to the place of Parliament in the national life and to the changes which have taken place, since theexisting emoluments were fixed, in general standards of remuneration, and to the increases in expenses borne byMembers of both Houses in the discharge of their duties.&apos;&quot;The Committee will, of course, take evidence from whateversources it wishes, but in order to assist it in carrying out itstask, Her Majesty&apos;s Government, in consultation with the other parties, have appointed an Advisory Panel with which the Committeewill be able to consult and from which they will be able to obtainadvice on parliamentary matters.;iThe following have agreed to serve on the Advisory Panel:Lord Tvireedsmuir, Chairman, Lord Champion, the hon. Member forBebington (Sir H. Oakshott), the hon. Member for Bradford, West(Mr. Tiley), the hon. and learned Member for Ilkeston (Mr. Oliver),the hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Rhodes), and the hon. Member for Huddersfield, West (Mr. Wade).&quot;The Government consider that the Committee should be askedto report as soon as possible after the General Election and that whatever action seems appropriate in the light of its report should then be taken without delay.&quot;2. This statement by Sir Alec Douglas-Home was welcomed by you as Leader of the Opposition and by the Rt. Hon. Joseph Grimond,*Leader of the Liberal Party.3. In the course of discussion which we had with the AdvisoryPanel at an early stage in our proceedings the question arose whether our terms of reference included consideration of pensions for Members of theHouse of Commons and of the House of Commons Members&apos; Fund.   We raisedthis matter with Sir Alec Douglas-Home and on the 18th February 1$61+we were informed:&quot;The Prime Minister takes the view that it would be desirableif the Committee were prepared so to interpret their terms ofreference as to enable them to consider the question of pensions for Members of the House of Commons and arrangements for theMembers&apos; Fund.&quot;The Prime Minister has consulted Mr. Harold Wilson andMr. Grimond and they concur in this view.&quot;* Hansard, 19th December 1963* cols. 12+42-43.2
PROCi&amp;URE OF K1E COJ^IT.igEk-. In deciding the procedure which we should adopt in order to investigate the matters referred to us we have had the great advantageof the advice and assistance of the Advisory Panel under the chairmanship of Lord Tweedsmuir.5. It seemed to us, and the Panel concurred with our view, thata formal hearing of evidence to be recorded and published would delayproceedings and might hamper freedom of discussion.   We thereforeproceeded as follows:-(l) In order to ascertain the opinion of the House of commons as a whole we circulated a confidential questionnaire, of whicha copy is reproduced in Appendix A to this Report, to all members of the House.   It was drafted with a view to elicitingpersonal expressions of opinion and the replies are not in a form which is capable of statistical analysis.   Some 520Members responded and we are satisfied that we have thus beengiven a good indication of the problems of Members and of theirdifferent points of view.(2) We took steps by meeting representative Members of theHouse of Lords to ascertain the views of Members of that House.(3) We interviewed leading Members of all three political parties in both Houses of Parliament.(4) We interviewed Officers of both Houses of Parliament.(5) We received written statements from and had discussions with some holders and former holders of certain ministerialposts regarding which Tire felt the need for special information and views.(6) We had meetings with representatives of the Board of inland Revenue and with the Government Actuary and we receivedfactual memoranda from them and from H.K.Treasury.(7) We requested and received factual information from theForeign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office on the remuneration received by members of certain overseaslegislatures.
(8) We received and considered letters and memoranda from anumber of Members of both Houses, as well as from members ofthe public.6. We are grateful to all those who furnished us with information and views and who gave of their time and expert knowledge to assist usin our enquiry.   In particular we would express our thanks to theAdvisory Panel with whom we had several meetings in the course of which ydiscussed and received advice upon the matters within the scope of ourreview.   The wide experience of both Houses enjoyed by the members ofthe Advisory Panel and their willingness to place the benefit of that experience at our disposal have been of inestimable value to us.REMUNERATION OF MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS(a) History7. Remuneration for Members of the House of Commons from public funds was first established by a Resolution of the House of the1 Oth August 1911 and by a Supplementary Estimate of the 14th August 1911The terms of the Resolution were:&quot;That, in the opinion of this House, provision should bemade for the payment of a salary at the rate of four hundred pounds a year to every Member of this House, excluding anyMember who is for the time being in receipt of a salary as anofficer of the House, or as a Minister, or as an officer ofHis Majesty&apos;s Household.&quot;8. By 1910 there had been criticism of the continuance of thetradition of unpaid parliamentary service.   This criticism was basedon changes in the composition of the House which had occurred sincethe Reform Acts and on changes in the character of its work.   Theintention of the G-overnment, if they were returned to power at the next general Election, to propose the provision out of public funds for thepayment of Members was announced by the Prime Minister on the 18thNovember 1910, immediately before the election took place.   Thereafterthis new charge on public funds was foreshadowed by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer in his Budget statement made on the 16th May 1911 and wasembodied in the Resolution of the 10th August 1911.9. At that time the proposal met with considerable opposition inthe House, mainly on the grounds that payment to Members would tend toHansard, 1Oth August 1911 , col.1365.
lower its reputation, to compromise the independence of Members and to lead to a number of Members becoming whole-time professional politicians,The arguments of the Government in supporting the Resolution were to theeffect that in no other parliament was no contribution at all made to theexpenses incurred by members in the performance of their duties; thatthese expenses had grown with the increase in the work of the House andwith the greater number of attendances which this required; and that membership of the House should become more representative of the nation as a whole by enabling it to include persons whose qualities fitted themfor parliamentary service but whose lack of means precluded them from taking it up.&apos;i0. The incidence of taxation soon gave rise to controversybecause, in accordance with the use of the word &quot;salary&quot; in the resolution and with a statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in answer to a parliamentary Question on the 18th May 1911 to the effect that the salaries of Members of the House would be liable to tax as earned income,the Inland Revenue had so assessed the payment for tax.   representations were made to the Chancellor of the Exchequer by a deputation of members on the 12th July 1912 and, after subsequent investigations had been made into the possibility of a flat rate deduction allowable to all Members asa reasonable average to cover the expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of parliamentary duties, an allowance of  100 a year as sucha deduction with effect from the beginning of the financial year 1912/13was authorised by Treasury Letter of the 30th August 1912.*11 . This concession led to the inclusion of section 3   in &quot;theFinance Act, 1913* which provided that:&quot;Where the Treasury are satisfied with respect to any classof persons in receipt of any salary, fees, or emoluments payableout of the public revenue that such persons are obliged to lay out and expend money wholly, exclusively, and necessarily in the performance of the duties in respect of which such salary, fees, oremoluments are payable, the Treasury may fix such sum as in theiropinion represents a fair equivalent of the average annual amountlaid out and expended as aforesaid by persons of that class, andin assessing the income tax on the salary, fees, or emoluments ofpersons of that class, there shall be deducted from the amountthereof the sums so fixed by the Treasury.   Provided that if anyperson would, but for the provisions of this section, be entitledto deduct a larger amount than the sum so fixed, that sum may be deducted instead of the sum so fixed.&quot;On the 23rd October 1913. in pursuance of this section, the Treasuryissued a Minute covering the deduction of  100.This section was subsequently re-enacted as Rule 10 of the rulesapplicable to Schedule E by the Income Tax Act, 1918, and asRule 8 by the Income Tax Act, 1952.
12. The great increase in the cost of living ?/hich had taken place during and after the first war led to the appointment on the26th November 1920 of a Select Committee &quot;to consider the salary allotted to Members of this House, the travelling and other expenses incurred bythem in connection with their parliamentary duties&quot;.   This SelectCommittee reported to the effect that, if the sum of  400 was necessaryin such an amount was inadequate in 1920 but that in the existingeconomic circumstances they found themselves unable to recommend any immediate increase in the salary.   At the same time they expressed theopinion that the financial difficulties of some Members made itdesirable that further consideration should be given to the matter inthe near future,13. The Government decided that it was reasonable to treat thewhole of the  400 as an allowance for expenses exempted from tax.   Theview of the Inland Revenue was that there was nothing unreasonable inthis if the Treasury was of the opinion that  400 had become the fairequivalent of the average annual expenses of a Member of the House forthe purpose of Rule 1 0 of Schedule E.14. The Government&apos;s proposal, however, encountered so much publicopposition that on a free vote of the House, taken on the relevantSupplementary Estimate on the 1st June 1921, it was rejected.   In replyto Parliamentary Questions on the 8th and 23rd June 1 921 , the Chancellorof the Exchequer took the opportunity to explain the kind of expenses inexcess of  100 for which Members could claim tax relief, drawing a clear distinction between the allowable expenses of travel between Westminsterand a Member&apos;s constituency (the two branches of a Member&apos;s &quot;place ofbusiness&quot;) and the expenses of travel between home and a place of business which were not allowable to any taxpayer.15. After 1921 the cost of living began to fall and continued to doso for many years thereafter.   Apart from the introduction in 1924 ofcertain privileges in respect of free travel and a temporary abatementof salaries between 1931 and 1935, no further action was taken in thematter of the remuneration of Members until 1937.16. In that year in the debate on the Ministers of the Crown bill the Prime Minister (Mr. Baldwin) undertook to carry out informal and confidential enquiries among Members to see whether there was an acceptable case for an increase in the salaries of Members,   On the27th May 1937 he announced the Government&apos;s intention to propose anincrease from  400 to  600.   In moving the appropriate Resolution on the22nd June the new Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain) explained that his enquiries had revealed a number of cases of Members who, with no other resources than their parliamentary salaries and despite undesirable6
economies, were unable to keep within their means.   In recommending theincrease of  200 the Prime Minister said:&quot;It is obvious that the circumstances are different in the caseof almost every individual Member.   On the one hand, one does not want to fix the salary so high that it becomes an inducement to people to enter this House for the purpose of earning more than theywould earn outside and, on the other, we do not want to fix it solow that men or women who could give valuable service to the house should be prevented from doing so merely by the fact that theyhave not sufficient means to afford it.   I do not think it ispossible to fix any figure and say that is the exact amount thatis appropriate, but the late Prime Minister and I, having giventhe best consideration we could to the matter, came to theconclusion that of the alternative figures that we considered, 500 and  600,  500 still would not be sufficient for a certainnumber of Members, and that it would be better, therefore, toadopt a figure which would settle the matter for an indefinite period rather than fix again a sum which would give rise tocomplaints, and a feeling that sufficient allowance had not beenmade for the altered circumstances.   After that consideration,therefore, we resolved to recommend to our colleagues in theMinistry, and subsequently to this House, the figure of  600 .....131The appropriate Supplementary Estimate providing for the increase to take effect from the 1st July 1937 was agreed to on the 26th July 1937*17. After the second war the situation again called for investigation in the light of the greatly increased cost of living.   a select Committee was duly appointed &quot;to consider the expenses incurred in connection with their parliamentary and official duties by Members ofthis House, including Ministers whose salary is less than  5,000 perannum; their remuneration; and their conditions of work.&quot;   This committee reported on the 6th March 1946 that an analysis by the Inland Revenue of claims for expenses which had been allowed for the first nine months ofthe financial year 1945/46 showed that in the Committee&apos;s view the sumwhich should be allowed for expenses lay between  450 and  600.   they recommended that the salaries of Members should be increased to  1,000of which  500 should be allowed to Members as an expense allowance free of income tax.18. Parliamentary and public opinion was opposed to a flat rateallowance for expenses of  500.   The Government proposed a simple increasein parliamentary salaries to  1,000, leaving the procedure for claimingtax relief in respect of parliamentary expenses unchanged.   This proposal was embodied in a Resolution passed on the 29th May 1946.19. The cost of living continued to rise and another SelectCommittee was appointed on the 4th November 1953 to consider and reporton inter^j^ia &quot;the nature and extent of the expenditure incurred by&quot;Hansard, 22nd June 1937, col. 1052.7
Members of this House In the performance of their duties&quot;.   ThisCommittee reported on the 2nd February 1954 that the then salary of 1 ,000 was not enough to enable Members to meet the expenses necessarilyentailed by membership of the House and to keep themselves and their families in reasonable circumstances while attending to their parliamentary duties unless they were possessed of financial resourcesother than their parliamentary salaries; and that any relief givenshould not be by way of additional free services or special tax concessionsbut by a straightforward increase of salary.   They recommended that the salary should be increased to  1,500 and that the automatic allowance of  100 (first established in 1912 and then still in force) should be discontinued.20. In the light of their economic policy of urging restraint in salary and wage claims the Government were unable to accept the Select\, Committee&apos;s recommendations.   After a Resolution of the House to theeffect that Members&apos; allowances should be raised by  500 a year had beencarried on a free vote of the House notwithstanding the intervention ofthe G-overnment in favour of an amendment providing for the reimbursementto Members of Schedule E expenses within a limit of  500 a year, thePrime Minister announced on the 24th June 1 954 that the G-overnment wereprepared to discuss with Leaders of the Opposition Parties methods ofdealing with the problem of the financial difficulties of some Membersalternative to the increase in salaries from  1 ,000 to  1,500 proposed bythe Resolution.21 . As a result of these discussions the Prime Minister on the8th July 1954 announced the G-overnment&apos;s intention to introduce asessional allowance, payable to those Members who chose to draw it, of  2for every day (other than a Friday) on which the House sat.   The PrimeMinister explained the proposed allowance in the following terms:&quot;This allowance will constitute a cash reimbursement,related to the actual sittings at Westminster, of the subsistenceand other expenditure which Members are obliged to incur.   members will still remain eligible under the existing law for relief from income Tax on their salaries (as distinct from the new allowance)in respect of expenses &quot;wholly, necessarily and exclusively&apos; incurred in the performance of their duties.   They will continue under their;existing obligation to justify to the Inland Revenue authorities their claims in respect of their total expenses.   The justification to theRevenue will therefore include those expenses in respect of which theydraw the sessional allowance.   The sum drawn in the form of the newallowance will be deducted by the Inland Revenue from the totalexpenses on which the Member would otherwise be entitled to claimrelief.&quot;On the 26th July 1954 &amp; Supplementary Estimate was agreed to providingfor this sessional allowance and the automatic deduction of  1 00 wasabolished by Treasury Minute of the 21st July 1954.* Hansard, 8th July 1954, cols. 2347-48.CONFIDENTIAL
22. Further rises in the cost of living and increases in salaries and wages both in the public service and in outside employment led torenewed pressure on the Government from Opposition Leaders to increasethe remuneration of Members of the House.   The Prime Minister, whileadmitting that &quot;some increase in the salary of Members would be justifiednow if there were not certain special considerations&quot; , refused any immediate increase on the ground that if at the very moment when thesuccess of their efforts in the battle against inflation was in thebalance the Government appeared themselves to be taking steps tocontribute to the inflationary spiral, the nation would not believe thatthey took a serious view of that battle.   He promised, however, that theGovernment would not maintain their refusal longer than was absolutely necessary in the broadest national interest.23. On the 4th July 1 957 &quot;the Prime Minister announced proposalsfor an increase in Members&apos; salaries, using the following words to describe the nature of the proposals:^&quot;.....,the Government have decided to propose to the House thatthe total emoluments of hon. Members of this House should beincreased to  1,750 a year.   The basic salary would remain unchangedat its present level of  1,000.   But, in view of the SelectCommittee&apos;s findings, the Government consider it appropriate to add to it a sum of  750 which will take the place of the presentsessional allowance.MLike the basic salary, this sum will be liable to tax,   Hon.Members will be entitled, as hitherto, to claim that, beforeassessment of tax, the expenses incurred in the discharge of their parliamentary duties shall be deducted from their gross emolumentsofeS1,750.&quot;24. The Select Committee referred to was the Select Committeeappointed on the 4th November 1953.   The relevant findings in theirReport were that in 1946 the average amount allowed by the Inland Revenueas expenses was  550 but that in 1953 the average was  750.   A Resolutiongiving effect from the 1st July 1 957 to this proposed increase in salarywas moved by the Government and carried on the 9th July 1 957-25. By 1960 further rises in the cost of living and in the general level of salaries had caused the financial position of Members againrelatively to suffer deterioration and thereafter the Government wereonce more subjected to pressure to take steps to increase their salaries.The Government did not accede to the representations made to them andthe remuneration of Members of the House has remained at  1,750 a yearuntil the present time.* Hansard. 12th July 1956, col. 624./Hansard.   4th July 1957, cols.1308-09.9
26. It is now 53 years since payment from public funds for parliamentary service was first made to Members of the House.   TheGovernment Motion approving the payment was moved on the 10th August 1911by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Lloyd George.   The purposewhich this payment was intended to serve was expressed by him in bothpositive and negative propositions.   We think that the concludingpassage of his speech may well be recalled in this Report.   It ran asfollows^&apos;-: -&quot; .... .When we offer  4-00 a year as payment of Members ofParliament it is not a recognition of the magnitude of the service,it is not a remuneration, it is not a recompense, it is not even a salary.   It is just an allowance, and I think the minimum allowance,to enable men to come here, men who would render incalculableservice to the State, and whom it is an incalculable loss to theState not to have here, but who cannot be here because their meansdo not allow it.   It is purely an allowance to enable us to open the door to great and honourable public service to these men, for whom this country will be all the richer, all the greater, andAll the stronger for the unknown vicissitudes which it has to faceby having here to aid us by their counsel, by their courage, and bytheir resource.&quot;The wording is oratorical rather than precise but the sense is clear.By the decision to sanction payment to its Members the House appears tohave recognised the force of the criticisms of unpaid parliamentaryservice and to have accepted the arguments of the spokesmen for theGovernment in support of the Motion, to which criticisms and argumentswe have already referred in paragraphs 8 and 9 above.   This decision has never since been successfully challenged: its strength and validityhave grown with the passing of time.   The principle of payment and thenature of its purpose we take to have been established in this way bythe House of Commons more than half a century ago.27. The considerations, however, which have determined the amountof the payment are more important for our present purpose.   It isuseful again to go back to the first enunciation of principle.   This isto be found also in the same speech by Mr. Lloyd George where he said&quot;.....The only principle of payment in the public service is that you should make an allowance to a man to enable him tomaintain himself comfortably and honourably, but not luxuriously,during the time he is rendering service to the State.   That is theonly principle, and it is the principle on which we have proceeded.&quot;* Hansard, 10th August 1911, col.1383./^Hansard, 10th August 1911, col.1382.10
28. The principle so stated is capable of a wide variety ofparaphrase.   It has been frequently paraphrased in discussions whichhave taken place since 1911 -   Without attempting a similar exercise ofour own we think that it is important to analyse the conception behind the words used and to draw attention to their implications.29. In the first place they appear to us to postulate theexistence of candidates for parliamentary service who have neither theprivate means nor the opportunity of earnings outside Parliament whichwill enable them to assume this form of political life.   Secondly, forsuch persons the payment offered should not be so high as to include any element of &quot;luxurious&quot; living but should recognise that parliamentaryservice calls for and should be willingly accorded a measure of personalsacrifice.   At the same time the payment should not be so low as to deter such persons for financial reasons from entering or remaining inthe House.   Poised between these two extremes the payment should be suchas not only to enable the man with no external means to become a Memberof the House without financial embarrassment but to allow him to discharge the proper expenses of conscientious and efficient membership and to liveat a level consistent with the dignity of the service.   He should not be forced to resort to sacrifices which impair the quality of his serviceand lower the reputation and prestige of Parliament itself.30. Although in the end we have concluded that this analysis ofthe principle provides the only practical working basis on which we canproceed, it would be misleading to convey the impression that there areno difficulties in the way of its uncritical adoption.31. The first difficulty involves the question whether the salaryshould be regarded as recognition of full-time or part-time service.   Thisquestion has never received any authoritative answer in the various recommendations which have been made from time to time on the subject ofthe salary.   Our questionnaire to Members of the House specificallyincluded this question (see Appendix A to this Report).   The replies didnot provide a conclusive answer.   Many were to the effect that inpresent conditions, whatever may have been the case in the past, the salary should be regarded as a recognition of full-time service.   Onthe other hand a substantial number of replies disclosed a firm belief that the House would suffer considerably in the quality of its work if itconsisted entirely of &quot;full-time professional politicians&quot; and thus lost the benefit of the counsel of those Members who spend some part of their time actively engaged in professions and occupations outside the House.It was frequently said that the strength of the House lay in its great variety of membership and that continuous contact with the outside11
world on the part of a substantial number of Members contributedgreatly to the reality of its debates.32. It is unnecessary for the purposes of our review that weshould express any opinion on this question.   It is enough that weshould consider and take into account the pertinent and relevant facts.These are that the House of Commons contains and no doubt will continueto contain not only a number of Members who have the opportunity of supplementing their parliamentary salary by earnings made outside theHouse but also a number (and possibly a growing number) of those whosimply cannot do so.   The possibility of making such earnings variesgreatly from Member to Member, being dependent largely on the nature oftheir training, skills and previous occupations.   In some cases theseare of a nature which precludes altogether the opportunity of making any outside earnings.   As has often been observed before, a railwaymanand a miner cannot follow their occupations on a part-time basis as can a journalist and a lawyer.   Thus the fact is that for some Membersof the House their membership is the only occupation from which they are able to draw a remuneration,33* The second difficulty arises from the variety of the personalcircumstances of Members themselves.   First, there is the possession ofother souroes of income.   Some Members have a private income, and thisis likely to remain a feature of membership of the House for some time.Some Members can follow a part-time occupation or profession outside theHouse.   This is also a feature which will no doubt continue to attach to parliamentary life.   The possession of these extraneous sources of income and the commendable readiness to devote this iniome in whole orin part to meeting the expenses of parliamentary service are factors which reduce the financial needs of some Members below the level whichwould be the result of applying the principle first enunciated in 1911and analysed in paragraphs 26-29 of this Report.   Secondly, in additionto this complication there are the results affecting the expenditure ofMembers w,ich arise from the geographical and other differences between their constituencies.   We refer to this matter in more detail later inour Report (see paragraph 50 below).34. This lack of homogeneity is a central feature of membership of the House and it necessarily precludes the fixing of a salary at a level which will exactly meet the needs of all Members, simply becausethese needs are by no means uniform.35. These difficulties lead to two possible conclusions.   Thefirst alternative Is that the salary for all Members, whatever the typeof their constituency, should be such as will enable those Members who12
are without private means or the opportunity to earn income outside theHouse efficiently to discharge the duties of the service without unduefinancial worry and to live and maintain themselves and their familiesat a modest hut honourable level.   The second alternative is some systemof differential remuneration which would attempt to meet, if only verybroadly, the variation in the circumstances of individual Members.36. The latter alternative would in our judgement give rise inpractice to insuperable difficulties of assessment, even if it wereintrinsically desirable.   It would be impossible to assess the value ofthe difference between part-time and full-time service or the degree towhich time available for external earnings is equivalent to the realopportunity or ability to make them.   Nor would it be possible or desirableto take account of the private sources in income or capital of Members orof the varying burden imposed by different types of constituency in assessing the salary to be paid to them.   We are convinced that such asystem would give rise to far greater difficulties than those which itsought to meet.37* We therefore reach the conclusion that the first alternative is the one which must be adopted.   In so far as this solution will putmoney into the hands of those who do not need it, the surplus to someextent will be taken back by taxation.   To the extent to which this doesnot happen, it must in our opinion be accepted as the unavoidable resultof the variegated nature of membership of the House.   There is, however,nothing to prevent a Member, who so wishes and who has the necessarymeans, from regarding his membership as a voluntary service and fromforegoing his parliamentary salary in whole or in part.( c) Amount38. It remains to determine a figure.   Its assessment can only bean act of subjective judgement.   Parliamentary service is an occupationof which the nature is unique and therefore neither the principle of&quot;fair comparison&quot; nor any comparative method can give guidance towards theappropriate figure.   Nor is the remuneration of this service something which ought properly to be governed by the forces of competition or bymarket value.39, One suggestion repeatedly made to us was that the remuneration of Members of the House should in some way be linked to a level of salary13
in the Civil Service on the ground that this approach would not onlyindicate some comparative level of salary to be initially adopted but would ensure that as and when salaries in the Civil Service wereadjusted in accordance with the established principles affecting thosesalaries, the salaries of Members of the House would likewise bemaintained at an appropriately up-to-date level.   This is a suggestion which we firmly reject.   In the first place we are fully satisfied thatthere is no basis of comparison at all between the two types of service.Secondly we are far from accepting the principle that the remuneration of Members of the House should be linked to any external scale:    itshould be determined on its own and should not enjoy any automaticbuilt-in protection.   A third point which can be made against thesuggestion is that any link between salaries of Members of the house and salaries in the Civil Service might involve the latter at timesin political controversy,40. In the end therefore we have been left to exercise our ownjudgement on the facts disclosed to us against the background of allthe matters which we are required to bear in mind by our terms ofreference.41 . We have read the evidence given to Select Committees in thepast and we have given close attention to all the evidence written andoral given to us, in particular to the answers to the questionnaire sentto Members and to the views expressed at the interviews we have had with members and Officers of both Houses.   The effect of this evidence is toleave us with the conviction that the present salary of  1,750 a yearfalls far short of the standard originally adopted in 1911&apos;   Moreover,we are satisfied that in this sense the earlier levels of salary have for many years been inadequate to a substantial degree even if theamount fixed in 1911 met the standard on which it was said to be based.42. The evidence which we have received has demonstrated that members who have neither private income nor outside earnings have been and are suffering hardships which impair the efficient performance oftheir duties and detract from the dignity of Parliament in its properplace in the national life.   These Members, of whom there is an increasing number not limited to one side of the House, are forced toendure the discomfort, in spite of tax relief, of cheap and shabbylodgings in London; they cannot afford to use the Members&apos; Dining Room;they have to submit to the humiliation of not being able to returnhospitality even at the most modest level of entertainment; they areforced to impose considerable sacrifices upon their families and they14
find it necessary to cut down the number of days on which they canattend sittings of the House.   The result of all this is that if theydo not receive help from some external source they are continuallyharassed by financial anxiety.   We are satisfied that this is a situationwhich has been present for a long time and well before the presentsalary was fixed in 1957-   The hardships described in the answers to the questionnaire which we addressed to all Members of the House arematched by similar descriptions in the evidence given to select committees in the past.   The addition of  750 in 1957 did not in ourview fully remedy the situation existing at that time.   It follows thatthe inadequacy of the existing salary is not merely the result of thefall in the value of money and the rise in the cost of living since1957.   It has been endemic in the House for a longer period than that.43. We draw attention to this aspect of the matter not only onaccount of its intrinsic importance, but also to make it clear thatin our view a proper level for the remuneration of Members of the Houseof Commons cannot be found by taking 1957 (or indeed any other date)as a base and adding to the figure of  1 ,750 an amount calculated by reference either to the fall in the purchasing power of the pound orto the rate of growth in national productivity. In our view this isan exceptional case.( d) Deductible Expenses44. In any assessment of the proper level of the remuneration ofMembers of the House the amount of their expenditure incurred in the performance of their parliamentary and other duties must be a vitally important factor.   The short historical review with which we began thissection of our Report has indicated how often this matter of the amountof their expenditure has arisen in the past and how much at all stagesit has been affected by the incidence of taxation.   The assessment ofthe remuneration of Members of the House and of Ministers for purposesof income tax is the duty of the Inland Revenue.   This duty has to be discharged in accordance with the law and practice of taxation whichdoes not differentiate between Members of Parliament and the general body of taxpayers.   In discharging this duty the Inland Revenue mustapply established principles to all the relevant circumstances.   Thesecircumstances are of course multifarious and general rules lead towhat are thought to be anomalies in certain cases.   One instance15
is the treatment for tax purposes of the salaries of Ministers towhich we draw attention later in this Report (see paragraphs 122 -129below).   Another difficulty arises from the fact that the totalremuneration of Members and of Ministers is liable to tax under shedule E, deductions being allowed only for expenses incurred &quot;wholly?exclusively and necessarily in the performance&quot; of the duties of theirrespective offices.   In this context some fine distinctions have arisen between parliamentary duties and political activities.    consistently with the established principles of taxation under Schedule E the inland Revenue allows the deduction of expenses under the following main heads:(l)    the additional cost of living away from home when engagedin parliamentary duties either at Westminster or in the constituency but not in both (applicable only to Members whohave constituencies outside the London area);(2)    the cost of stationery, postage, telephone, telegrams and similar items incurred for parliamentary duties;(3)    the cost of secretarial and clerical assistance for parliamentary duties;(4)    travelling expenses on parliamentary duties( a)   within the constituency and(b)   between Ylfestminster and the constituency,being the excess over the cash allowance made to Members inrespect of travel by car;(5)    other necessary expenses incurred for parliamentary dutiessuch as, for example, the cost of hiring rooms to meetconstituents, of pamphlets   etc.   informing constituentsof the Member&apos;s parliamentary activities, and subscriptionsto a local agent or party association in return for whichthe Member obtains help in his parliamentary work.45. On the other hand the same principles of assessment have resulted in the following heads of expenses not being allowed:(1)   literature issued for canvassing purposes;(2)   election expenses;(3)   periodicals, books, newspaper cuttings, etc.;16
(4) charitable subscriptions or donations;(5)     entertaining;(6)     extra costs arising out of late night sittings;(7)     expenses incurred by wives of Members, e.g. in deputisingfor or accompanying Members;(8)     payments to political organisations for political purposes;(9)     generally, expenses which the Member incurs not as a Memberof Parliament but as a member of a political party.46. The effect of these rules is that by no means all the reasonableexpenditure of a Member is deductible for tax purposes.   The expenses ofMembers of the House were obviously a matter to which we had to givedetailedi consideration.47* The foregoing review of the history of the remuneration ofMembers has necessarily included the vicissitudes of an allowance for expenses as an ingredient in their total emoluments.   The present amountof these, namely  1,750, is made up of what the Prime Minister in makinghis statement on the 4th July 1957 referred to as the &quot;basic&quot; andunchanged salary of  1,000 and an addition of  750 which was in substitution for the then existing sessional allowance and was equivalent to theamount which the Select Committee had reported on the 2nd February 1 954was the then average amount allowed for expenses by the Inland Revenueunder Schedule E.48, We have been supplied by the Inland Revenue with the latestavailable figures of allowances for tax purposes made to Members of theHouse of Commons and to Ministers who are also Members of that House.These are reproduced in the tables in Appendix B to this Report.   Wewere informed that the median amounts of the expenses of Members(excluding Ministers) shown in the first of these tables were for1960/61 ,  1,033; for 1961/62,  1 ,066; and for 1962/63,  1 ,088.   Takenin conjunction with the figures in the similar Appendix VI to the Reportof the Select Committee of 1954-, these figures show the trend of increase in these expenses and the extent to which the figure of  750is now out of date.49. It would be wrong and misleading to take these figures as an indication of the financial circumstances of every Member of the house and to deduce from them that after payment of expenses all Members are left with a sum of about  700 to meet their living expenses.17
50. In the first place there is the considerable extent of thedispersion.   In relation to the latest figure of  1 ,088 it is to benoted that there were 20 Members whose expenses allowed for tax purposesdid not exceed  500:   at the other end of the scale 55 Members were allowed expenses to the extent of the whole of their parliamentary salary.    One reason for this dispersion may be that many Members are compelled to restrict their expenses to what they can afford.   Anothermay arise from geographical and other differences between constituencies.At our request the Inland Revenue supplied us with figures showing inseparate detail the expenses allowed for tax purposes to Members(excluding Ministers) for London constituencies, for urban constituencies and for rural constituencies.   These figures are reproduced in the table in Appendix C to this Report.   This table shows that the incidence of these expenses is much higher in rural and in provincial urbanconstituencies than it is in the London constituencies and that the overall median figures mentioned in paragraph 48 above are less than themedian figures for rural constituencies.   No doubt there is also an individual difference in this matter between each of the constituencies in the three categories.51. In the second place the expenses referred to are only thosewhich are allowable under Schedule E.   From these are excluded expenseswhich, according to the evidence we have received, many Members find themselves bound to incur for purposes such as those referred to inthe sub-headings (l) to (9) in paragraph 45 above.52. The examination which we have made of the expenses incurred byMembers of the House- reveals a fact which we think is not generallyappreciated outside the House,   That fact is that a Member of the Housemust incur exceptionally heavy expenses in order to discharge his duties.The total amount of a Member fs salary is often referred to in terms whichimply that the whole of it, less tax, is available to him for his livingexpenses: industrial and other wages and incomes are then contrastedunfavourably with it.   Such an attitude is wholly wrong and can lead toseriously mistaken impressions on the public mind.   Unlike an industrialor office worker, a Member of the House has no employer who provideshim with the equipment necessary for his work and who pays his expenses.A Member does enjoy the allowance for travel and the few and limitedfree facilities which we discuss in paragraphs 55 - 69 below where werefer to the question, brought to our notice by many Members, of theirextension.   For the reasons there given we think that we must take thepresent system as we find it.   On this basis a Member for the most parthimself has to pay the cost of the services and assistance which he needs18
CONFIDENTIAL31for the purpose of his duties.   This cost can amount to a very substantial proportion of his emoluments.   If any reference is made toa Member&apos;s remuneration in comparison with other incomes, the relevantfigure is not that of his total emoluments but what is left to him after he has paid the expenses of his service.   The two figures may be greatlydifferent.(e) Conclusions53. Having regard to all the matters mentioned in our terms ofreference, in particular to the changes which have taken place, sincethe existing emoluments were fixed, in general standards of remuneration(nearly ell of which have been substantially upward changes), and to the increases in expenses borne by Members of the House in the discharge oftheir duties; taking careful account of all the evidence we havereceived; adopting the principle formulated in 1911 in all its modernimplications; bearing in mind what we have to say later about other benefits, and particularly pensions, and using the best judgement wecan upon all these matters, we recommend that the salary of Members ofthe House of Commons should be increased from the present figure of 1,750 to  3,250 a year.54-. As we have pointed out in paragraph 23 above, this present figure of  1,750 at its inception was, at any rate notionally, dividedinto two parts: a basic salary of  1,000 and an addition of  750, beingthe amount found by the Select Committee in 1954 to be the average amountof the expenses allowable under Schedule E.   Use was made of this division to enable all Ministers in the House of Commons, Mr. Speaker,the Chairman and Deputy   Chairman of Ways and Means and the Leader ofthe Opposition to draw  750 a year of the total parliamentary remunerationin addition to their salaries, the purpose being to provide ministers and the others mentioned with a parliamentary salary against which theycould obtain tax relief up to that amount in respect of their parliamentaryexpenses as Members of the House.   We refer to this matter later inthe section of this Report which deals with the remuneration of ministers of the Crown, where we make a recommendation that the present practiceshould be continued in an enhanced amount.   We are of opinion that this amount should be  1,250 a year.19
FACILITIES FOR MEMBERS OF .THE HOUSE OF COMMONS(a) Travel55. Members of the House of Commons are entitled to vouchersexchangeable for railway and steamship tickets and sleeping berthsfor travel on parliamentary duties between London and constituency,constituency and home, and home and London.56. They are also entitled to vouchers for the same categories ofjourney by scheduled air services where such services exist.57. A railway season ticket can be obtained by a Member whocertifies his intention to travel from his place of residence to theHouse on at least four days a week during the parliamentary sessions but such tickets are not available for use during the summer and Christmasrecesses.58. We were informed by the Inland Revenue that these travellingfacilities (which are not given in the form of cash payments and are notconvertible into money) are not subject to income tax.   In that respectthey differ from the car allowance referred to in paragraph 59 below.59. Members may claim mileage allo?/ance for the use of their carsfor the same types of journeys as those for which free travel by rail or air is provided.   The allowance is intended only to cover the cost of motor fuel and is subject also to the upper limit of the cost of first class rail fare.   It takes the form of a cash payment and is subject toincome tax in respect of journeys between home and constituency and home and the House of Commons but not between the constituency and theHouse of Commons.60. We received many representations suggesting additional oraltered facilities for travel allowances.   We think it necessary, however,to comment on only two specific suggestions, viz. a proposal that members should be entitled to a limited number of vouchers for use bytheir wives (or husbands) for travel to Westminster and to the Members&apos;constituencies, and various proposals for improving or simplifying thecar allowance.61 . The point was made strongly to us that the nature of a Member&apos;sduties, particularly if his home was neither in London nor in his constituency, involved much enforced separation from his family.   This,it was suggested, was not only a personal hardship but detracted from theefficiency of the Member himself in that the Member depends on his wifefor assistance in his social duties both in his constituency and at westminster.20
62.We have given careful consideration to this proposal.   Weclearly understand the reasons for which it is put forward hut we have come to the conclusion that it is not a proposal which we can recommend.There are difficulties in principle in subsidising out of public fundsthe travelling costs of persons who are not in the public service andthere are practical difficulties in the determination of the upper limit of any such concession.   Clearly some limit would have to be placed onthe number of vouchers for free travel issued to the wives of Members.This was recognised by the advocates of the proposal but as might beexpected they differed on the question what this limit should be.   In anycase it could only be an arbitrary figure which would impose a uniformity of benefit where the needs are probably far from uniform.   We have cometo the conclusion that this matter is best taken care of by the amountof the parliamentary salary and in recommending the increase in the amountof this salary we have borne this factor in mind.63. We are impressed by the views we have received concerning the complications, misunderstandings and even ill-feeling arising out of thepresent system of assessing the allowance paid to Members for travel bycar.   The present allowance is intended to cover only the cost of motorfuel.   There is therefore involved an assessment of the fuel consumptionof the car used based not only on engine capacity but on the age of thecar.   We believe a much simpler system under which the allowance would bea flat rate per mile would be more satisfactory, and we recommend a figure of 4^d. per mile which is the general rate per mile for first classrail travel.   In this connection our enquiries have shown us that thereare some differences of detail between the schemes in the two Houses ofParliament of paying cash allowances for travel by car.   We would suggest that if our recommendation with regard to the operation of thescheme in the House of Commons is implemented, consideration should begiven to the desirability of assimilating the two schemes.Commons for the performance of their duties are very much limited innature.   They include a certain supply of stationery; free postage forcorrespondence with G-overnment departments, with nationalised industries and with officials of the House; free telephone calls from the Housewithin the London area; free copies of parliamentary and certain otherofficial publications; the use of a limited number of rooms where members and Members&apos; private secretaries may do their secretarial and typingwork; and the use of a copying machine for making a limited number of copies of documents.(b) Other Facilities64.Other facilities in kind available to Members of the House of
confidential8465. . We received various proposals with regard to the extensionof the facilities which we have summarised in paragraph 64 above.   other proposals related to new facilities.   The most substantial of these latter proposals concerned, the provision of secretarial and researchassistance.   The proposals for secretarial assistance varied from theprovision of private secretaries for Members (or groups of Members) toa pool of shorthand typists or a remote dictation service.   On the otherhand objections were raised to individual private secretaries on theground of the expense involved and of the fact that by no means all members found the need for the full-time services of a private secretary.In addition this suggestion gives rise to difficulties in regard to accommodation in the way of separate offices for Members.   suggestions for a system of shared secretaries, for a pool of shorthand typists ora remote dictation service encountered objections on the ground of the confidential nature of much of a Member&apos;s secretarial work.   We find it difficult to reconcile the various views expressed to us on thesematters.66. Much has been said and written about the limited character ofthe facilities which are made available to Members of the House.   Theyhave been contrasted with those provided for members of other elected assemblies, in particular those of the United States of America, Australiaand France.   The proposals which we have mentioned would in effect, ifthey were implemented, amount to taking a big step along the road to theinstitution of free services such as are available to Members of congress of the U.S.A.   Some take the view that this is not an example to befollowed by Parliament: others take the opposite view.   The questionraises profound issues of policy and from the practical angle involvesmatters such as the provision of new buildings (now under consideration),a large extension of the Library of the House and of its staff, the granting of allowances for research assistants, foreign travel, etc.Some of these proposed changes cannot be effectively made until thematter of further accommodation has been decided.   Further, the individualneeds and preferences of Members for these facilities appeared from theevidence to vary very greatly.   In our view these issues are in any eventoutside our terms of reference which we interpret to concern theprovision of adequate remuneration for Members of the House within theconfines of present policy.   We therefore do not express any view on thesematters.67* In reaching our conclusion on the amount of the salary for members we have, for the reasons we have given, taken the present practiceas we find it and on this footing have recommended a remuneration out ofwhich they can choose and pay for such facilities as they personally decidebest meet their individual needs.22
68. We desire to place on record the fact that Members referredwith gratitude to the assistance which they receive from the staff ofthe Library of the House, while suggesting that a further strengthening of this staff would be of great assistance to them.69. We also wish to refer to one minor matter to which we thinkthat consideration might with advantage be given.   This relates to theprovision of free postage.   A proposal was made to us from more thanone source that the present facility which is limited to correspondence with G-overnment departments, nationalised industries and officials ofthe House should be extended to cover correspondence with localauthorities.   The grounds for this proposal were that in modern conditions and particularly in the sphere of housing the interests oftheir constituents frequently require Members to engage in correspondence with these authorities and that since free postage is granted for thekind of correspondence indicated by the subject of the concession, itshould be extended by parity of reasoning to include correspondence with local authorities.   We are of opinion that there is a good case for this small extension of the facility and we suggest that this shouldbe granted.PENSIONS FOR MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND THE MEMBERS1 FUND70. The House of Commons Members&apos; Fund was set up by Act ofParliament in 1939 to make grants, based on an assessment of needs,to ex-Members, their widows and children.   The availability of thesegrants was extended to widowers by the House of Commons Members&apos; FundAct, 1948.   All Members are required to contribute to the Fund andthe rates of contribution and the maximum amounts of the grants havebeen changed more than once since the Fund was set up.   At present theincome of the Fund is derived from a contribution of  24 a year from each Member, an Exchequer contribution of  22,000 a year and dividendsand interest from the Fund&apos;s investments.   The Fund is administered by six Trustees drawn from Members of the House of Commons of the day,71. The normal maximum grant to an ex-Member is  500 a yearprovided that his total income, with the grant, does not exceed  700 a year..The normal maximum grant to a widow is  300 a year provided her total income, with the grant, does not exceed  500 a year.   Larger paymentsmay be made by the Trustees at their discretion having regard to lengthof service and need, with maxima of  900 a year to ex-Members and 450 a year to widows, subject to total income limits of  1,100 and23
 650 respectively.   Grants for children vary from  30 a year to  100a year depending on the number of children in the family and whetheror not one parent survives.   Rates of contributions and maximum grants to ex-Members and widows were last increased in May 1 961:   those for children have not changed since 1948.72. The setting up of the Members&apos; Fund followed the Report in1937 of a Departmental Committee which was appointed to examine thepractical aspects of a suggestion for a pensions scheme for Members ofthe House of Commons, the necessary funds to be raised and maintained by personal contributions from Members (whether compulsory or voluntary)without any charge to the taxpayer.   The Committee had found the ideaof a contractual pensions scheme to be impracticable and recommendedthat awards to ex-Members or their widows should be made according to need.   The Select Committee which was appointed in 1953 to examine thegeneral question of Members&apos; expenses was asked also to report on theextent to which the Members&apos; Fund fulfilled under present conditions thepurposes for which it was set up.   The Committee in addition toproposing certain improvements in the Members1 Fund recommended anon-contributory scheme for pensions to be awarded according to lengthof service and without regard to need.   This recommendation was referred in May 1954 to the Trustees of the Members&apos; Fund for further consideration and report.   The Trustees reported in March 1955 and proposed that thereshould be a new self-supporting contributory pensions scheme for members.   This recommendation, however, was not acted upon.   InMay 1961 when announcing the latest increases in the contributions toand in the benefits from the Members&apos; Fund the Chancellor of theExchequer said that the Government had considered afresh whether apensions scheme should be introduced.   They had, however, come again tothe conclusion that, apart from the difficult question of principlewhether membership of the House of Commons should be regarded as apensionable occupation, a scheme of pensions as of right would not be practicable owing above all to the uncertainty of the length of serviceof Members and to their widely varying private circumstances.   they therefore took the view that the right course was to increase theresources of the Members&apos; Fund in order that the Trustees might makelarger grants.   The Exchequer contribution to the Fund was accordinglyincreased from  10,000 a year (the rate at which it had stood since it was first authorised in 1957) to  22,000 a year.73. The large majority of those who have submitted evidence orexpressed views to us favoured the establishment of a pensions schemefor Members of the House of Commons,   A minority opposed a pensions24
scheme on the grounds that such a scheme was undesirable orimpractical or both and most of those considered that a more generousscheme on the lines of the present Members1 Fund   oould satisfactorilydeal with cases of hardship affecting retired Members or their dependants.   There was, however, considerable feeling, expressed inmany cases in the most emphatic terms, that no scheme based, as theMembers&apos; Fund is, on a means test could be a sufficient, just ordignified provision for those who had served for substantial periodsin the House of Commons.74. Those who favoured a scheme of pensions as of right put before us a great variety of proposals regarding the general nature ofthe scheme.   These proposals involved the following questions.   should it be a contributory scheme or should pensions be paid entirely out ofpublic funds?   If the scheme were to be contributory, should contributionsbe derived both from Members and from public funds and, if so, in what proportions?   What should be the minimum qualifying period for apension and should the pension increase and in what progression accordingto years of service?   From what age should the pension be payable?Should provision be made for widows (or widowers) and other dependants?Should provision be made for past service and, if so, should it coveronly those who are still Members of the House of Commons at the dateof the inauguration of the scheme?75. No self-consistent scheme can be evolved out of such a variety of proposals.   Many of the proposals were in fact diametricallyopposed one to the other.   We have considered the arguments used inthe past against the introduction of a pensions scheme for Members ofthe House of Commons, the developments since the Report of theDepartmental Committee in 1937 and all the arguments which have beenput before us.   Our conclusion is that a pensions scheme is desirable and that although service in the House of Commons has no parallelamong employments in industry or the professions, a workable and soundscheme can be devised.   Having come to this view, it remains for usto recommend a reasonable and fair scheme in the light of all thecircumstances.   This we endeavour to do in the following paragraphs ofthis section of our Report and in Appendix D.76. Before setting out our recommendations, however, it isdesirable to draw attention to two points of principle.   First, wehad to reach a decision on the question whether the scheme should cover past service at all and, if so, whether it should cover thepast service of those who have no service as Members after thebeginning of the scheme.   We recognise the hardship which would be25
involved in excluding past service entirely.    Total exclusion of past service would have meant that, in accordance with the schemewhich we recommend, no pensions at all would be payable until theexpiration of 10 years from now.   On the other hand we cannot acceptthe principle of applying a pensions scheme to those who have noservice after the date when the scheme begins.   On consideration ofthe whole circumstances we firmly recommend that the scheme should notapply to former Members of the House who have no service after thescheme begins and that their needs should be dealt with by theMembers&apos; Fund the continuance of which we recommend (see paragraph81 below) .   In the second place, we would point out that our recommendations on Members&apos; remuneration are based not only on theassumption that there will be a pensions scheme but also on the proposals we make that the pensions scheme should be of a contributory nature and that apart from the cost of crediting past service (see paragraphs78(8) and 79 below) the contributions should be borne equally byMembers themselves and by the Exchequer.77* The pensions scheme which we recommend will no doubt require legislation and we do not consider it necessary to deal with mattersof machinery such as the management of the pensions scheme which willbe covered by the legislation.   We are greatly indebted to theG-overnment Actuary for the technical advice which we have receivedfrom him.78. We recommend the establishment of a pensions scheme for members of the House of Commons and the following are our recommendations regarding the main provisions of the scheme:-(l) The scheme should begin during the first session of thenew Parliament of 1 964 and from the same date as that fromwhich Members&apos; salaries are increased.(2) Membership of the scheme should be compulsory.   Allpersons who are or become Members of the House of commons on or after the date of the beginning of the scheme should participate in it.(3) Contributions at the rate of  150 per year should bepaid by all members of the scheme so long as they remainMembers of the House of Commons and a like sum in respectof each Member should be paid out of public funds to thescheme.   There should also be paid out of public funds theamount referred to in sub-paragraph (8) and paragraph 79 below26
in respect of the credit which we propose for past serviceof members of the scheme.Benefits should be paid to all persons who qualify forsuch benefits under the regulations of the scheme in additionto any other pension to which they may be entitled and whetheror not such other pension is derived in whole or in part from public funds.Pension should be payable from the age of 65, or thedate of his ceasing to be a Member of the House if later, toa person who has ceased to be a Member of the House afternot less than 10 years&apos; service.   Pension should accrue atthe rate of  60 a year for the first 15 years of serviceand thereafter at the rate of  24 a year.Pensions should be payable to the widow, incapacitatedwidower and orphan or orphans of a Member or ex-Member whohad had not less than 10 years&apos; service in the House.The following table shows examples of the rate of pensionsrecommended for the Member (in accordance with his length ofservice) and for the widow (or widower):Pension					After 10 years		After 15 years		After 40 years	Member	Widow	Member	Widow	Member	Widow 600	 300	 900	 450	 1 ,500	 750Full credit for past service before the beginning of thescheme should be granted up to a maximum of 10 years, anyyears of past service in excess of 10 being ignored.   Thecost of crediting past service should be borne out of public funds.Any person ceasing to be a Member of the House without having qualified for a pension should be able to obtain a27
refund of his own contributions with interest.   If he issubsequently re-elected to the House he should be permitted to repay with interest any such refund and to count his previous service for purposes of the scheme.In framing the above recommendations we have assumed that Members&apos;contributions to the scheme will be allowable for tax relief and wehave taken into account evidence given to us that in recent decadesthe average length of service in the House has been about 15 years,   Amore detailed description of the scheme is set out in Appendix D.79&apos; It is not possible to calculate exactly the cost of creditingpast service as recommended in sub-paragraph 78 (8) above.   Finalfigures must await calculation based on the membership of the newHouse of Commons,   An approximate estimate is that it would requireeither an initial capital grant of about - 2-g- millions or an annual payment of about  150,000 for 25 years or an annual payment of about 120,000 for 40 years.80. Contributions of  300 a year in respect of each Member togetherwith the cost of crediting service before the scheme begins are calculated to be sufficient to support the benefits recommended.   Thiscalculation has necessarily been made in the light of past experience.Obviously it cannot take account of possible future changes in some ofthe relevant factors such as the average ages at which Members enter the House and retire from it and their average length of service.Significant changes in these and other factors will have to be takeninto account in future assessments of the adequacy of these contributions.Provision for valuations and for meeting a deficit, if one should emergeat any time, will of course have to be made in the scheme.81 . Our recommendations on Members&apos; remuneration and on theestablishment of a pensions scheme assume the continuance of theMembers&apos; Fund and of contributions to it by Members and by theExchequer at at least the present rates.   As mentioned in paragraph 76*above the Fund will be required for some time to come to meet theneeds of those who have ceased to be Members before the beginning ofthe pensions scheme.   There may also be some cases of need among members who enter the pensions scheme.   We have in mind, for instance,some among those who although entering the pensions scheme do not complete 10 years&apos; service, or who complete 10 years but, before reaching the age of 65, are unable to continue to be Members for reasons of ill-health or, having ceased to be Members, becomeincapacitated.   The provision of an incapacity pension for ex-member as a feature of the pensions scheme would, it seems to us, present28
very great difficulties.   Cases of hardship arising from incapacityamong ex-Members who have not qualified for a retirement pension underthe scheme will call for individual consideration of all the circumstances,medical as well as financial.   We think that in this type of case theexercise of discretion within the statutory limits in force for the timebeing can best be left in the hands of the Trustees of the Members&apos;Fund.82. The establishment of the pensions scheme which we recommendwill eventually lead to a diminution in the number of calls on theMembers&apos; Fund, but the effect on the Fund will be felt only slowly.   the trustees of the Members&apos; Fund will no doubt take this into accounttogether with changes in membership of the House of Commons and withother relevant circumstances when making any proposals concerningcontributions to or benefits from the Members&apos; Fund which they thinkappropriate.MR. SPEAKER83. The remuneration of Mr. Speaker is specifically mentioned in our terms of reference as a separate subject for review and recommendation.The present salary, which is  5,000 a year, was established by the Houseof Commons Officers1 Act, 1834.   The office is one of great dignity,prestige and responsibility and there can be no doubt that it submitsits holder to large expenditure in the performance of its duties.   Thisliability is made abundantly clear by the fact that in 1 928 by treasury minute issued under Rule 10 of the Rules applicable to Schedule E in theIncome Tax Act, 191 8, Mr. Speaker was allowed an increase in a flat ratededuction of expenses from  3,000 to  4,000 a year.   In other words atthat date it was officially recognised that the expenses necessarilyincurred in the performance of the duties of the office amounted to four-fifths of the salary of  5,000.84. The nature of this allowance and of others of the same kind which have been made from time to time by the Treasury under itsstatutory powers (see paragraph 11 above) is often the subject ofmisunderstanding.   The allowance does not mean that the amount involved is paid tax free in the sense that it does not attract tax at all and thatthe balance of the salary can be made chargeable with deductibleexpenses.   The amount is the Treasury&apos;s own estimate of the expensesof the office properly allowable under Schedule E if they were claimedand substantiated as such.   The procedure is thus strictly an29
administrative &quot;short-cut&quot; to reach the same position in relationto tax as would be reached if the expenses were formally claimedand allowed.   We have no material which will enable us to pronounceon the adequacy or otherwise of the amount of  4,000 in the case ofMr. Speaker.   On the assumption, however, that it was correct in 1928,it would appear that it is unlikely to be right in 1964 and we recommendthat the position should be reconsidered and any appropriate action taken.85. Some of the expenses incurred by Mr. Speaker, such as thecost of some forms of entertaining, do not satisfy the requirementsof Schedule E for inclusion in this allowance, although they may havebeen reasonably incurred for the purpose of maintaining the fulldignity of the office.   Mr. Speaker, if he has had no private means(he cannot engage in remunerative activities outside the House), hasbeen expected to defray the expenses of his office, other than theamount attributable to a free residence and certain other minor benefits,out of a salary of  5,000 a year.   On the footing of the Treasury&apos;sassessment of his expenses under Schedule E and on the assumption thatthere have not been any subsequent material changes in the relevant facts the position for the last 36 years has been that Mr. Speaker hasbeen left with a salary of  1,000 ( 1,750 since 1957) out of which hehas had to meet the non-deductible expenses of his office, the expensesof parliamentary duties in connection with his constituency and his ownliving expenses.   This seems to us to be an absurdity and we recommendthat the salary of Mr. Speaker should be increased to that which werecommend for the most senior departmental Ministers (see paragraph 11 below), together with the same parliamentary allowance of  1,250.86. The payment of a pension to Mr. Speaker is a matter of customand not of statutory entitlement.   So far as it lies within our termsof reference to do so, we recommend that effect should be given to aproposal made to us on more theji one occasion that his pension shouldbe attached to his office as a matter of right.   We think that theappropriate figure is  6,000 and we so recommend.THE PRIME MINISTER87. A Select Committee was appointed in 1 830 to consider whatreductions could be made in the salaries and emoluments of officesheld during the pleasure of the Crown by Members of either House of30
Parliament.   At that date the title of Prime Minister had no formalstanding   and the head of the Government was referred to by theSelect Committee as the First Lord of the Treasury.   The comments ofthe Committee on the remuneration of this office were as follows:-&quot;The FIRST LORD of the TREASURY has at present a salary of  5.000 a year, and an official residence.   It was the samein 1780, and has not since been altered; but the First Lordhas frequently had also other situations with large emoluments.As this office is one of the highest dignity and of the greatestduties, it is recommended that the Salary be continued at thenet sum of  5,000 a year.   When held with the office of chancellor of the Exchequer, it is proposed that one-half only of the Salary of the latter be attached to it, making in that case  7*500 a year.&quot;88. The following facts appear from Appendix No.5 to that committee&apos;s Report.   The &quot;other situations with large emoluments&quot;referred to included in 1780 the office of the Chancellor of theExchequer and the office of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.   In thatyear these offices were all held by Lord North who derived from thema total remuneration of about  10,500 a year.   His salary of  5,000as First Lord of the Treasury was paid partly from the Civil List andpartly from a source entitled &quot;Secret Service&quot;, the charge on theCivil List being at the same rate as the salary payable to Junior Lordsat the time, namely  1,600, and the balance coming from the othersource.   As Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord North received  1,652plus fees amounting to  778.   Thus for these two offices^ hisemoluments amounted to  7,430 a year.   In 1 782 the whole of the salary of  5,000 payable to the First Lord of the Treasury was placed on theCivil List.89. In 1850 another Select Committee was appointed to review the salaries of Ministers and the remuneration of other appointments madeby the Crown.   The reference in their Report to the remuneration of theFirst Lord of the Treasury, though only in general terms, is of someinterest.   It was as follows:&quot;.....Your Committee first selected those Offices which from the nature of the duties attached to them, have always beenconsidered of the greatest importance in a Government; namely,those of First Lord of the Treasury, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Three Secretaries of State, and the First lord the title of Prime Minister received formal recognition in 1905 when by royal Warrant the holder was given precedence next after the archbishop of York,With two exceptions, Mr, Gladstone during his first two Governments andMr, Baldwin in 1923. these two offices have not been combined in thesame holder for over 100 years,31CONVENTUAL
of the Admiralty.   For these Offices it is requisite to securethe services of men who combine the highest talents with thegreatest experience in public affairs; and considering the rank and importance of the Offices, and the labours and responsibilitiesincurred by those who hold them, your Committee are of opinion,that the salaries of these Offices were settled in 1831 at the lowest amount which is consistent with the requirements of thePublic Service.&quot;90. From the evidence given to this Select Committee the following matters may be extracted.   They are also of some interest in the historyof the remuneration of the office:between 1820 and 1849 the work of the Treasury and of all departments of Government had considerably increased;since 1 830 no other office had been held together with thatof the First Lord of the Treasury.   The salary attached tothe office of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports had been abolishedearly in the 19th century;the expenses of the office of First Lord of the Treasury were much more than  2,000 a year;the provision of an official residence was of doubtful financialadvantage and some First Lords had declined to occupy it.Between 1850 and 1920 many new ministerial offices were created and others were revived or abolished but the salary structure for ministers remained virtually unchanged.92. In 1920, after a lapse of 70 years, a Selecc Committee wasappointed to consider the remuneration of Ministers.   This committee made a number of general recommendations including one to the effectthat all members of the Cabinet, with the exception of the Prime Minister,should receive the same total salary.   With regard to the Prime Ministerthey expressed the view that in the light of the increasing burdens and responsibilities of the office the then current remuneration was inadequate and should certainly exceed that of other Cabinet Ministers.They recommended that the salary should be fixed at  8,000 a yearwhether or not the holder also occupied the office of First Lord of theTreasury, the remuneration of which they recommended should be abolished.Owing to the economic and other circumstances of the day the Governmentwere unable to accept these recommendations and no action was taken upon them.93. In 1930 another Select Committee was appointed to consider320)(2)(3)(4)
whether the Report of the Committee of 1920 required any modification.This Select Committee in their Report dated the 28th July 1 930 described the existing ministerial salaries as being in some respects anomalousand in others inadequate but they did not think that tho time wasopportune for a general revision.   They did, however, make one specific recommendation on the salary of the Prime Minister, namely that itshould be increased at the earliest opportunity to  7*000 a year, onthe grounds that the circumstances of his position made his salary of less value than that of any other Minister because his expenses werehigher, the annual sum required to meet them being at least  2,000.Once more the economic situation prevented any action being taken atthe time,94- In 1937, however, the Ministers of the Crown Act of that yearprovided for the payment of a salary of  10,000 a year to the PrimeMinister and First Lord of the Treasury,   The Act of 1937 also providedfor the payment of a pension of  2,000 a year to persons who had beenPrime Minister.95* In 1947 by a Treasury Minute made under Rule 10 of Schedule Eof the Income Tax Act, 1918, the Prime Minister was allowed a flat ratededuction for expenses of  4,000 a year and in 1957 (see paragraph 109below) he was accorded the addition of  750 a year to his salary of 10,000.96. There can be no doubt about the exceptionally graveresponsibilities and burdens of the office nor about the fact that it involves the holder in substantial expenses which are probably greaterthan those of any other Minister.   In contrast to other senior ministers the Prime Minister has received an increase in remuneration in fairlyrecent years but we are clearly of opinion that the present figure of 10,000 is wholly inadequate to accord with the prestige, the duties and the expenses of the office.   In our judgement it should beincreased to  18,000, together with the parliamentary allowance of 1,250 recommended for other Ministers in the House of Commons (seeparagraph 120 below), and the amount of the pension attaching to theoffice should be increased to  6,000.   Accordingly we so recommend,97. With regard to the allowance of  4,000 a year as a deduotionfor tax purposes, what we have said in paragraph 84 above aboutthe nature of a similar deduction allowed in the case of Mr. Speakerapplies to the case of the Prime Minister, as does our recommendation that the position be reconsidered and any appropriate action taken.33
CONFIDENTIAL106OTHER MINISTERS, EXCEPT rog^LORpjS^C^ORj^ jmLMjpmiGmS(a) History of Remuneration98. The salary being paid to senior Ministers to-day is  5,000a year, a figure fixed on the recommendation of the Select Committeeappointed in the year 1830.    The salaries of all other Ministers discussed in this section of our Report were and still are at levels below this figure.99- The recommendations of the Select Committee of 1830, madein their Report of 1831 , were accepted by the G-overnment of the day.From these recommendations the framework emerged of what are now the salary bands in the structure of ministerial salaries.   Broadly, with one or two exceptions, the salaries of senior Ministers were recommendedand fixed at  5,000 a year:    those of junior Ministers, generally, at 2,500,  2,000 or  1 ,500 a year.   A table of salaries at the levels of the years 1780, 1 830 and 1831/32 was submitted to us by the treasury and is reproduced in Appendix E to this Report.100. Another Select Committee to which we have already referred in paragraph 89 above was appointed in 1 850 for the purpose of a vd.dereview of the salaries and emoluments of public offices of various kinds.   This review included the salaries attaching to ministerialoffices.   The Committee did not recommend any large alterations inthe then existing levels of these salaries.   We may recall from thequotation from their Report made in paragraph 89 of this Report their conclusion with regard to the highest offices, namely the First Lordof the Treasury, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the three secretaries of State and the First Lord of the Admiralty, that the salaries ofthese offices were &quot;at the lowest amount which is consistent with therequirements of the Public Service&quot;,   They recommended, however,reductions in the remuneration of some junior Ministers as follows:Joint Secretaries tothe TreasuryJunior Lords of theTreasuryJunior Lords of theAdmiraltySalazles assignedin 1831 2,500^ , 200 1 ,000 withresidenceIgS^SgleotCommittee&apos;srecommendations 2,000 1 ,000 1 ,00034
These recommendations were accepted by the G-overnment,101, The next Select Committee to consider the matter was appointed in 1920.   In the meantime certain offices had been newly created orrevived and others had disappeared.   Salaries attaching to new offices in newly formed Departments were provided for in the statutes settingup the new ministries.   The general rule adopted in the assessment ofthe salaries of the junior Ministers in the Departments of State was to assign a salary of  1,500 where the Minister in charge of the Departmentreceived  5,000 and  1 ,200 where the Minister in charge received ^S2,000.Exceptions were the Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade whowas paid a salary of  2,000 and the Assistant Postmaster G-eneral(appointed in 1909) who was paid a salary of  1,200 (the salary of thePostmaster G-eneral then being  2,500) .102. The Select Committee of 1920 on Ministers&apos; remuneration, while recognising that conditions had changed since the existing scales hadbeen established, did not think that it was then a suitable time torecommend by a general increase in ministerial remuneration a largeaddition to the total amount of money allocated to the payment ofMinisters.   They confined themselves to the consideration of the relative position between one Minister and another, having regard to their responsibilities or to the work of the office held.   Their main recommendations were:(l)     that the salary of the Prime Minister should be raised to 8,000 in recognition of the increasing burdens and responsibilities which recent Prime Ministers had had tobear (see paragraph 92 above);(2) that all members of the Cabinet, apart from the Prime Minister,should receive the same total salary irrespective of the officeheld (see paragraph 92 above);(3)     that no Minister should receive an allowance in respect of a house which he did not occupy nor suffer a reduction of salaryif he chose to accept the offer of an official residence,&apos;(4)     that the salary of the Lord Chancellor paid from the consolidated Fund should not exceed that of a Cabinet Minister(but see paragraphs 133-134 below);(5)     that offices, with the exception of those of the Prime Minister35
and the Law Officers, should be classified in fiveclasses, namely:Class I: all members of the Cabinet		at  5,000 a year;Class	II:	senior Ministers outside the Cabinet at  3,000 a year;Class	III:	junior Ministers and senior Under Secretaries at  2,000 a year;Class	IV:	other Under Secretaries at  1,500 a year;Class V:		Lords Comvni ssioners of the Treasuryat  1,000 a year.In the economic and other circumstances then prevailing the Governmentwere unable to implement these recommendations.103. In 1930, as we have mentioned in paragraph 93 above, anotherSelect Committee was appointed to consider whether the Report of theSelect Committee of 1920 required any modification in the light of the then existing circumstances.   We have already referred in paragraph 93to the material part of the conclusions of this Committee.   It was thatthe existing scale of ministerial salaries was in some respects anomalousand in others inadequate but that the time was inopportune for ageneral revision.   The Committee endorsed the classifications recommendedby the Committee of 1920,   Owing to the adverse economic conditions atthe time the Government did not take any action on the Committee1sReport.1 04. Apart from the temporary abatement in salaries between 1 931and 1935 no further step was taken until 1936, when the House ofCommons resolved in effect that the recommendations of the Committee of1920 should be implemented as soon as possible.   The result was thepassing of the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, which was the firstcomprehensive enaotment relating to ministerial salaries.105. This Act made a number of individual salary changes withinthe classification bands but apart from providing for a salary of 10,000 (and a pension of  2,000) for the Prime Minister, it generallygave statutory confirmation to the levels of remuneration which had then been paid for something over a century.   The highest salary for senior36
Ministers was still fixed at  5*000-   Four Ministers, the lord president of the Council, the Lord Privy Seal, the Postmaster G-eneraland the First Commissioner of Works received  3,000 ( 5,000 if theywere in the Cabinet); the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasuryreceived  3,000 and the Minister of Pensions  2,000; junior Ministersranged from  2,000 to  1 ,000.   The Act also provided for the paymentof an annual salary of  2,000 to the Leader of the Opposition.106. In 1945 another Select Committee was appointed to considerthe expenses incurred in connection with their parliamentary and official duties by Members of the House of Commons, including Ministerswhose salary was less than  5,000; their remuneration; and their conditions of work.   This Committee recommended (see paragraph 17 above)that the salaries of Members should be increased from  600 to  1 ,000,of which  500 should be allowed to Members as an expense allowance free of income tax, and that this tax free allowance should be drawn by ministers with salaries under  5,000 a year in addition to theirministerial salaries.   Members&apos; salaries were increased, to  1 ,000 ayear but the recommendation that  500 should be treated as an expenseallowance was not accepted.107. The recommended extension to Ministers of the allowance of 500 was achieved by the Ministerial Salaries Act, 1946, which gaveto Ministers being paid less than  5,000 a year the right to receivenot more than  500 a year by way of salary or allowance in respectof their membership of the House of Commons.   This Act also increased the salary of the Postmaster G-eneral from  3,000 to  5,000; that of theMinister of Pensions from  2,000 to  3,000 and that of the assistant postmaster G-eneral from  1 ,200 to  1 ,500.   It made no change in theposition of senior Ministers.108. The salaries of senior Ministers were abated between 1951and 1954.   Another Select Committee was appointed in 1953 to considerthe nature and extent of the expenditure incurred by Members of theHouse of Commons in the performance of their duties.   The recommendationsof this Committee included a recommendation that Ministers who were members of the House should receive the same payment as other members in respect of their parliamentary duties.   It was pointed out thatthis payment would enable Ministers to claim relief from income tax ontheir parliamentary expenses in the same way as other Members, thusremoving an existing anomaly.   The Government were unable to accept therecommendations of the Select Committee.109. The situation remained unchanged until the passing of the ministerial Salaries Act, 1957- This Act followed immediately afterthe increase in the emoluments of Members of the House to a total of 1.750, of which  750 took the place of the existing sessionalconfidential
allowance.   By repealing section 6(2) of the Act of 1937&apos;  itenabled all Ministers to receive this allowance of  750 in additionto their salaries.   The Act also made certain changes in ministerial salaries by providing that salaries not exceeding  3,000 should beincreased as follows:(1)     that the salaries of the Financial Secretary and theEconomic Secretary to the Treasury should be  3,750;(2)     that other salaries should be increased by(a)  1,000 where they were less than 2,000 and(b)  750 in any other case.This Act also increased the salary of the Leader of the Opposition from 2,000 to  3,000.   No further changes have been made since the passingof this Act.   Ministerial offices in the Government as constituted shortly before the recent dissolution of Parliament and their salaries are shownin the table reproduced as Appendix e to this Report.(b) Amount ojP EMmeration110. It was the consensus of all Y/ho expressed views to us onthe matter that ministerial salaries should be substantially increased.We have no doubt whatever that this view is right.   Particularly is thisso in relation to junior Ministers.   The evidence left us in no doubt at all that at the present level of salaries for these appointments ithas become increasingly difficult to secure the services of youngermen of the right quality and that there have been refusals andrelinquishments of office from sheer inability to meet the financialsacrifices involved.   On appointment a Minister in the House of Commonsnot only has to give up all but  750 of his parliamentary salary, buthe is at once debarred, as of course is also a Minister in the House ofLords, from supplementing his ministerial salary by engaging in an occupation outside Parliament.;!:This sub-section prevented any Minister in receipt of a salary underthe Act from receiving &quot;any sum out of moneys provided by parliament by way of salary or allowance in respect of his membership of theHouse of Commons.&quot;38
111 - In approaching the question of what should be the amountof the substantial increase in ministerial salaries which is now required, we have found no assistance of a direct nature which wouldguide us to a satisfactory answer.   In our view the present levels ofthese salaries have become irrelevant to the question and provide nostarting point whatever from which an answer may be deduced on any basis.   The exercise is of an entirely novel nature.   The highest salary of  5*000 for a senior Minister was first established 133 years ago andupward changes in the salaries of other Ministers have all taken placebelow this maximum.112. Further, as in the case of Members of the House of Commons,no criterion of direct comparison is available.   The office of a minister of the Crown in all its incidents is unique.113. One point which was taken several times in the evidence submitted to us and which has some relation to specific figures wasthat it was wrong that a senior Minister should be paid less than thepermanent head of his Department.   That this happens is true because there has been adjustment from time to time of the salaries of theCivil Service and no change in the salaries of senior Ministers.   In1937* &quot;the year of the Ministers of the Crown Act, the salary of aPermanent Secretary was  3,000; in 1963, with effect from the1st August of that year, it had risen to  8,200:   , 3,200 more than the salary of the Minister with responsibility for the Department.   Thisindicates that salary is out of line with status and illustrates theutterly obsolete and archaic nature of present ministerial salaries.We think it is inappropriate that a senior Minister should be paid lessthan his &quot;Chief of Staff&quot; but no adjustment of ministerial salaries to restore old relativities or to create new ones can lead to a realisticanswer to the problem.114. Thus in order to make a recommendation we have again toexercise our own subjective judgement, guided by a consideration ofthe matters referred to in our terms of reference, namely, the responsibilities of Ministers, the place of Parliament in the national life and the changes which have taken place, since the existing emolumentswere fixed, in general standards of remuneration.115. The responsibilities of a Minister of the Crown are graveand weighty and the position of a Minister of the Crown is intimatelyrelated to the place of Parliament in the national life, which should beso maintained that it commands the respect of all citizens.   There canbe no doubt that general standards of remuneration in all walks of lifehave very substantially increased, certainly in the last twenty years.39
116. All these considerations point towards a large measure of increase.   On the other hand we were urged by some not to neglectthe element of sacrifice in the taking up of public service and notto regard parliamentary service and ministerial promotion solelyin terms of a professional career.   We accept these submissions andare clearly of opinion that the salaries of Ministers cannot and ought not to be measured by the amounts which can now be earned outside thepublic service at the top of the professions and at the higher executivelevels in the world of business.(c) Conclusions117&quot; Having regard to all these considerations and using the bestjudgement we can we have reached conclusions on the matter which willform the subject of our recommendations.   In our opinion the most convenient way of expressing them is to take the salaries set out inAppendix F and to indicate in each case the revised figures which werecommend for adoption.118. For the groups of Ministers mentioned next after the PrimeMinister and the Lord Chancellor in Appendix F we make tho following recommendations:Present salary	Recommended salary 5,000	 12,000 4,500	 1 0,750 3,750	  7,500 3,000	  6,000 2,500	  5,000,32,200	  4,400 2,000	  4,000119. We think that we should briefly explain the reasoning behindthese recommended figures, because an analysis of them will show thatthey do not reflect the existing relativities between the various levels of salary.   The prolonged maintenance of the figure of  5,000 for senior ministers and the need from time to time to make increases in the salaries of other Ministers but still to keep them below this figurehave led to what we think is an artificial and undesirable compressionof the relativities, having regard to the differing responsibilities and40
confidential113status of the offices concerned.   In our judgement the opportunityof a comprehensive review of the whole scale of salaries and of itsre-establishment on an up-to-date and realistic basis should be takenin order to get rid of a pattern which appears to us not to be theresult over the years of the free play of all proper and relevantinfluences but to be the effect of the maintenance of a rigid andobsolete ceiling which has unduly restricted the possibility of comprehensive adjustment.   This accounts for the element in ourrecommended scale which gives more by way of increase to senior than to other Ministers.   We are quite satisfied that the salaries which werecommend for senior Ministers are not more than is commensurate withthe status and responsibilities of their offices, taking into accountall the relevant matters to which we have referred in the course ofthis section of our Report.   At the same time the salaries which werecommend for other Ministers in our opinion not only are appropriate to their offices but should be enough to remedy the situation in whichthe nation is said to be losing the services of suitable Ministers, a situation which has so cogently been represented to us.120. In this connection we draw attention to the fact that those ministers who are Members of the House of Commons are entitled to drawat present  750 of their parliamentary salary.   We have referred tothis matter in paragraphs 54 and 109 above and we recommend that thesame Ministers should continue to be entitled to this allowance butin the increased amount of  1,250.   The reasons for our adoption ofthis figure as part of the salary of Members of the House of Commons torepresent an average amount of expenses have already been given.   Wewere told that in each of the three years for which figures of expensesare shown in Appendix B the median figure for expenses of Ministers was 750.   In each year that was also the amount of their parliamentaryallowance.   It seems to us to be a fair inference that this allowance has become inadequate to cover all properly deductible expenses.121. We recognise that the result of the recommendation in the immediately preceding paragraph is that Ministers in the House ofCommons will continue to receive by the aggregation of their salary andtheir parliamentary allowance a total of emoluments which will be greaterthan the salary paid to Ministers in the House of Lords to whom no suchallowance is payable.   The view was put to us that we should not makeany recommendation which would establish a difference in remunerationbetween Ministers in the House of Commons and Ministers of the samestatus in the House of Lords.   In our opinion our recommendation doesnot do this.   The parliamentary allowance in the House of Commons41
has been made for the purpose of providing the recipient with means todischarge the expenses not of any part of his ministerial office but of performing the parliamentary duties which arise from his representationof a constituency.   These expenses do not fall upon a Minister in theHouse of Lords and an allowance additional to his salary is not requiredto meet expenses of this kind.   There is nothing new in the payment ofthe allowance to Ministers in the House of Commons: all we recommendis that the amount of it should now be put at a realistic figure.(d) Incidence of Taxation122. Having stated our conclusions and recommendations on ministerial salaries we desire to add some comments on the incidence of the law of taxation as it falls on these salaries.   Our reason for doing this is that we have received numerous complaints of what hasbeen called the anomalous treatment for tax purposes of a Minister inthe House of Commons who after appointment continues to represent a constituency outside London compared with the treatment accorded tohim by the Inland Revenue &quot;before he became a Minister.   A Member fora constituency outside London, where his home is in London, is entitledto deduct the expenses of the additional cost of living in his constituency; where his home is in his constituency, he is entitled toa deduction for the additional cost of living in London and. where his home is neither in London nor in his constituency, he is entitled to a deduction for the additional cost of living either in London or in his constituency but not in both.   On the appointment of such a Member asa Minister, however, he is regarded by the Inland Revenue as being required by his ministerial offioe to be in London   and his entitlement to deduct living expenses is limited to the additional cost of livingaway from his home when visiting his constituency, which he is  obliged to*Certain Ministers concerned with Scottish and Welsh affairs are regarded as being stationed for the purpose of their ministerial &apos;duties in Edinburgh or Cardiff.   When such Ministers travel toLondon they are entitled to claim the subsistence costs andtravelling expenses available to all Ministers who travel on duty:they cannot therefore claim against their parliamentary salaries for the cost of living in London.   They can, however, like other ministers claim in respect of additional living expenses incurred on parliamentary duties in their constituencies when they are away from their &quot;base&quot; in Edinburgh or Cardiff.42
incur in carrying out his parliamentary duties.   To this extent, and itmay have a substantial effect on the amount of his tax relief, a minister in the House of Commons is in a disadvantageous positioncompared with non-ministerial Members of that House.1 23. It was urged upon us that we should recommend the abolitionof this &quot;anomaly&quot;.   We have inquired of the Inland Revenue the reasonsfor this difference in treatment and have considered the whole matter with care.   We are satisfied that the situation which is the subjectof the complaints is the unavoidable result of the principles establishedby the terms of Schedule E under which Members and Ministers are taxed.It has also been made clear to us that any alteration of the present practice to enable Ministers, to whom the relevant circumstances apply,to receive the same treatment as is given to Members in this regardeither would constitute a   discrimination in favour of Ministers in theapplication of the existing law or, if this result was to be avoided,would, unless the law were amended in favour of Ministers alone, open the door to similar relief being granted to a number of taxpayers amongthe general public.   We understand the sense of injustice which has given rise to the submission made to us but, taking the lav/ as we find it, we cannot make the recommendation which has been requested.124. The reason for the discrepancy in treatment lies in the wording of paragraph 7 of the Ninth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, 1952, whichis the latest statute to contain the basis of taxation under Schedule E.A similar rule appeared as long ago as 1853 in section 51 of the IncomeTax Act of that year.   Its terms are as follows:&quot;If the holder of an office or employment of profit is necessarily obliged to incur and defray out of the emoluments thereof the expenses of travelling in the performance of the duties of the office or employment, orof keeping and maintaining a horse to enable him to perform the same, or otherwise to expend money wholly, exclusivelyand necessarily in the performance of the said duties, theremay be deducted from the emoluments to be assessed theexpenses so necessarily incurred and defrayed.&quot;It has been explained to us that it is well established that the costof living at or near the place where the duties of an office or employment are performed is incurred not in the performance of thoseduties but in order to put the office holder or employee in a positionto perform them.   This expense therefore is not covered by the wording of paragraph 7-    Ifj however, the holder of an office or employment hasto travel in the performance of his duties (e,g, a commercial traveller),and to bear these expenses out of his remuneration, he is entitled toa deduction for expenses which he incurs for travel in carrying out his43
duties and such travelling expenses are regarded by the Inland Revenueas including the extra cost of living (e.g. hotel expenses) necessarilyincurred when travelling in the course of his duties.   A Member for a constituency outside London is regarded as holding a travellingoccupation on the footing that he has equally important duties at westminster and in his constituency.   He is thus entitled to regardone of those places as his &quot;base&quot; and the other as a place where heperforms his duties when travelling away from his &quot;base&quot;.125. The position of a Minister is said to be different becausehis duties require him to be present in London, whether or notParliament is sitting, in the sense that other persons holdingappointments centred on a London office are required to be present inLondon.   On becoming a Minister, a Member of the House of Commons islooked upon as having continuing duties as a Minister at the seat ofGovernment in London.   These duties, which can be exercised only inLondon, are regarded as predominant over his duties in his constituency.It follows that his living expenses in London are the ordinary livingexpenses of a man who must live within reach of his work.   They arenot therefore incurred &quot;in the performance of his duties&quot; and onlythe extra cost of living away from his home when he visits his constituency can be charged against his parliamentary allowance asa Member of the House.126. We were satisfied that this position is not confined to thecase of Members who become Ministers but has analogies over a fairlywide field of the world of business,12^. If we may venture an opinion on the matter it seems to us that this is only one more of the grievances of the taxpayer which from time to time have originated from the system of taxation under shedule E, particularly in comparison with that under Schedule D.The former system has been repeatedly criticised by the Courts andcompared unfavourably with the latter.   The Royal Commission on the taxation of Profits and Income discussed the matter at length inparagraphs 118 to 143 of their Final Report   issued in 1955 -   In thelight of this latest complaint made to us against the application of schedule E it is significant that the Commission oame to the conclusionthat there was no good reason for treating Schedule E expenses lessgenerously than Schedule D expenses, except to the limited extent thatsome difference of treatment is inherent in the nature of the two kinds of income.   They recommended that paragraph 7 of the Ninth ScheduleCmd. 9474: H.M.S.O.44COM FIDE INITIAL
should be re?rorded on less restricted lines and proposed that an allowance should be made in respect of aall expenses reasonably incurredfor the appropriate performance of the duties of the office or employment&apos;&quot; in order to bring the wording of Rule 9 into a closerconformity with the wording of the Schedule D Rule.   Nothing has beendone to implement this recommendation.128. We do not express any view on the desirability or otherwise of an alteration of the law.   We can only say that unless and until some such alteration is made, the so-called &quot;anomaly&quot; affecting Ministers inthe House of commons and other taxpayers in similar case cannot be avoided for Ministers unless they are to be placed in a special position.1 29. A further point arising from the terms of paragraph 7 of the ninth Schedule which may conveniently be noted here is that the allowance is made only in respect of expenses defrayed out of the emoluments of theoffice; thus if in any one year a Minister&apos;s permissible expenseschargeable against his parliamentary remuneration are more than this sum,he is unable to obtain any tax relief for the excess, which cannot becharged against his ministerial or other income.THE LORD CHANOELLOR130. It has appeared to us to be part of our duty to consider theoffice of the Lord chancellor and to make a recommendation with regardto his salary.   There can be no doubt in our view that the office ofthe Lord Chancellor is a ministerial office in that he is a member ofthe Cabinet exercising in this capacity executive functions.   Eor thisreason we think that his remuneration falls within the scope of our terms of reference.131 . This is not the place to discuss at length the constitutional position of the Lord Chancellor.   It is an office which historicallyhas combined the high judicial functions of the head of the Englishjudiciary with the duties of a member of the executive G-overnment.   Itwas the view of the first Lord Birkenhead that it was of vital importanceto the Government that they should have the constant advantage of the daily counsel and experience of a colleague who was the head of thejudicial system and possessed the highest legal qualifications.   Inthis way the Lord Chancellor provides a link between the executive andthe judiciary which may well save the country from disastrous conflictsbetween them.   In addition he is the presiding officer of the House of45
Lords.   This is the tripartite nature of his constitutional position the status and prestige of which should be reflected in the amount of his salary relatively to ministerial and judicial salaries generally.132. In 1832, following the report of the Select Committee of1830 appointed to inquire what reductions could be made in the salaries and emoluments of offices held during the pleasure of the Crown byMembers of either House of Parliament, the salary of the Lord Chancelloras Speaker of the House of Lords was fixed at  4,000 and his judicialsalary, then payable from the Suitors&apos; Fund, was fixed at  10,000, an aggregate remuneration of  14,000.   This fixed salary took the place ofemoluments in the form of fees from his own Court of Chancery and fromhis salary and emoluments as Speaker of the House of Lords.   Both sourcesvaried greatly from year to year in the amounts which they yielded.   Thenew salary of  14*000 was less than the average of the preceding years.* 133. The next change occurred in 1851 when the Court of ChanceryAct of that year provided that the judicial salary of the LordChancellor should be fixed at a sum sufficient to make up the salarypayable to him as Speaker of the House of Lords to a total of  10,000a year.   This Act thus introduced a new concept, namely, that theexisting judicial salary of  10,000 should be reduced by the amount of. the salary he received as the presiding officer of the House of Lords.By the Court of Chancery Act, 1852, the judicial salary of  6,000, asso fixed, was transferred from the Suitors&apos; Fund and was made a charge on the Consolidated Fund, the balance of  4,000 remaining a charge onthe Vote of the House of Lords.134. Apart from the temporary abatements common to all ministerial* salaries between 1931 and 1935, the amount of salary paid to theLord Chancellor as Speaker of the House of Lords has remained at thefigure of  4,000 to this day, and the total salary remained unaltereduntil 1954.   In that year by the Judges&apos; Remuneration Act the LordChancellor&apos;s salary was increased by  2,000 making the total salary 12,000, at which level it has remained to the present day.135* Since 1 851 the salary of the Lord Chancellor has been treatedas the aggregate of the two sources, the judicial element being reducedby the amount of his salary as Speaker of the House of Lords,   This methodadopted by the Court of Chancery Act, 1851, was continued by section 13(1)of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925.   Theresult of this is that the judicial part of the salary is now no morethan that established by the Act of 1954 for puisne judges,136. We are of the opinion that if our recommendations in respect of46
COBFlDENTlftk119ministerial salaries generally are adopted, the total salary of theLord Chancellor should be increased in order to preserve a markeddifference of remuneration consistent with the eminent nature of his office and with his position at the head of the judicial hierarchy ofEngland entrusted with the great responsibility of recommendingappointments to judicial office.   Moreover the office of Lord Chancellor inour opinion should continue to be an object of ambition to the ablestmembers of the Bar as the highest position constitutionally open to them as lawyers.   The Lord Chancellor&apos;s salary therefore should be set at a level acceptable to such leaders of the Bar as have the outstandingqualities and attainments required for the discharge of the manifoldduties of this great office.137* With all these considerations in mind we have reached theconclusion that the total salary of the Lord Chancellor should be fixed at  17,000 and we so recommend.   We make no recommendation with regard tothe amount of that part of the total salary attributable to theSpeakership of the House of Lords which is not within our terms ofreference.   We are concerned only with the total salary of the officebut if for any purpose it should be desired notionally to quantify theappropriate judicial element, we are of opinion that this notionalfigure should be  15,000.138. Before passing from our consideration of the Lord Chancellor&apos;sremuneration, we desire to refer to the amount of the pension payable toholders of this office on their resignation.   The Lord Chancellor&apos;pension Act, 1832, abolished a number of offices connected with theCourt of Chancery and enabled the Crown to grant by Letters Patent tothe occupant of the office an annuity not exceeding  5,000 to take effect immediately after his resignation and to continue for and during his natural life.   The annuity was made chargeable on the consolidate fund and a power was given to the Crown to limit by the Letters Patentpayment of the annuity to such periods as the grantee should not hold the office of Lord Chancellor or any other office of profit under theCrown, so that the annuity together with the salary of such other office should not exceed  5,000.   By the Administration of Justice (Pensions)Act, 1950, this annuity was reduced by one quarter, i.e. to  3,750, inreturn for the payment of a lump sum on retirement equal to twice theannual amount of the pension: this Act also provided for the paymentof a widow&apos;s pension of one-third of the Lord Chancellor&apos;s pension (andfor certain pensions for dependent children),   a contribution equal tothe annual amount of his pension being required to be made by the pensioner towards the cost of these benefits.   By the Judicial pensions act, 1959? the annual amount of any pension granted under the
Lord Chancellors Pension Act, 1832, was restored to  5,000, at whichfigure it has since remained; the lump sum, the widow&apos;s pension and the contribution towards that pension being correspondingly enhanced.   Fethink that, even when account is taken of the lump sum and other benefits,this figure, as the amount of a pension for an ex-Lord Chancellor, is out of date and should be increased.   It has been urged upon us thatit is desirable that an ex-Lord Chancellor should be available to take part in the judicial work of the House of Lords.   It is unreasonable inour opinion to expect an ex-Lord Chancellor to give this service at thepresent level of the pension provisions.   We think that, consistently with our opinion that the figure of  15,000 a year should notionallyrepresent the judicial element in his salary, the amount of theLord Chancellor&apos;s pension should be increased to  7,500 a year, this figure to carry with it, in accordance with the terms of the Acts of1950 and 1959, proportionate increases in the benefits and contributionmentioned above.   Accordingly we so recommend.THE LAW OFFICERS139. We were able to gain a proper appreciation of the nature and duties of their offices from the valuable evidence which we receivedfrom those who, currently with our enquiries, were holding or had heldoffice as Law Officers in England and Wales and in Scotland and were able to speak from their own personal experience.140. To take the case of the English Law Officers first, it was represented to us that the total burden of work on them is different from that which rests on other Ministers because the Law Officers haveadditional duties which are not part of the normal work of Ministers.These additional duties include for instance appearing in court forthe Crown, almost always in heavy cases such as those before theInternational Court of Justice and the House of Lords, advising theG-overnment on constitutional matters and on international law and treaties and generally advising the House of Commons and its Committees on all matters of law affecting their work.   Particularly does the responsibilityof this work fall on the Attorney-General whose burden, it was represented to us, was as heavy as that of the most heavily engagedMinister.   The Solicitor-General assists the Attorney-General and doesnot have to carry so heavy a burden but his office is nevertheless oneof considerable responsibility and importance.lifl. To pass to the case of the Scottish Law Officers, the office ofthe Lord Advocate, while not carrying such an extremely heavy burden as thatCONFIDENTIAL
of the Attorney-General, carries responsibility for a number of duties ofthe highest importance in Scottish affairs.   He is responsible for advising the Cabinet and Ministers generally on Scottish legal and constitutional questions, for the conduct of litigation in Scotland raised by or against any Government Department and for the correctness of government bills affecting the law of Scotland.   His duties also include that of advising the Government on questions of legal policy affecting Scotlandand of advising on appointments to judicial office.   In the administrationof the criminal law in Scotland he is personally in charge of the entiresystem, exercising a function analogous in England and Wales to that ofthe Director of Public Prosecutions.   The Solicitor-General forScotland assists the Lord Advocate in these duties.142. The importance to the Government and to the nation that these four offices should at all times, whatever party is in power, be capablejjp of being filled by men of the highest professional skill and competenceneeds to be stressed because, if they are not so filled, the results could obviously be seriously damaging to the national interest.   InEngland and Scotland the Law Officers are recruited from members of the bar in each country.   It follows that in order to secure men of theright quality for the office selection must be available from the verysmall field of those with the highest attainments in their profession.We were impressed by the evidence that for some years that part of this field which includes Members of the House of Commons has been seriouslycontracting.   The expedient, if it were practicable, of appointing a leading Queen&apos;s Counsel who has had no prior experience of politics inthe House to one or other of these offices and then of finding a &quot;safe&quot;constituency for him to represent is not one which In our judgementprovides a wholly satisfactory solution to the problem.   It would bemore than unfortunate if the time should come when the only candidatesavailable for selection were those who had been unsuccessful in theirprofession.143. The offices of the Law Officers, both in England and inScotland, have never at any time so far as total emoluments were concernedbeen fitted into a pattern of purely ministerial office: nor have theyfallen within any classification of salaries payable to the holders ofthese offices.   Their duties make their offices different in kind fromthose of other Ministers.   The criterion by which the amount of the salaries of the Law Officers of both countries must be judged is in ouropinion one of recruitment rather than of status.   It is difficult todetermine what motives lie behind a barrister&apos;s entry into the House ofCommons but if the possibility of appointment as a Law Officer may be an49
COKSUBMWIAL122incentive to the &quot;best men to &quot;become Members of the House, we think thatit is essential that the attraction of this possibility should not beremoved by the extent of the financial sacrifice entailed in accepting the office.144- It follows therefore in our view that the salaries of the LawOfficers must bear some reasonable relation to the earnings of theleaders of the profession.   This is not to say that they should beequated with these earnings because no doubt there will rightly be a readiness to accept a reduction of income on the assumption of a publicduty.   It is unrealistic, however, to suppose or to expect that the wide gulf between the present salaries and the professional earnings of outstanding leaders at the Bars of England and Scotland can be left asit is without the danger that in no long interval of time there will befewer entrants of high quality from the Bars into the House and greater difficulty in finding suitable candidates for appointment as Law Officers.145- The present salaries of the Attorney-General and of the solicitor-General for England are  10,000 and  7,000 a year respectively.These amounts were fixed in 1946 and took account of the fact that atthat date the long established right of the Law Officers to receivefees for contentious business was abolished.   Their total incomes were,however, thereby greatly reduced.   In 1957 they became entitled in common with other Ministers to draw an allowance of  750 a year inrespect of their membership of the House of Commons.   Otherwise therehas been no change in their salaries since 1946.   Taking all relevantmatters into consideration as they exist at the present time we are ofopinion that a marked difference in salary between the Attorney-Generaland other Ministers (a difference which has been generally accepted without question for a great many years) is unavoidable and we recommendthat his salary should be increased to  16,000.   The present relationship between the salaries of the English Law Officers appears to us to be approximately correct and we therefore recommend that the salary of the solicitor-General should be increased to  11,000.   Both the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General should like other Ministers be permitted to draw the parliamentary allowance of  1,250 in respect of membership of the House of Commons.146. Professional the Scottish Bar are not at the same level as those at the English Bar.   The present salary of theLord Advocate is  5,000 a year, fixed as long ago as 1894-   Like theEnglish Law Officers he receives no fees additional to his salary and since 1946 has been precluded from engaging in private practice.   Sincethe 1st July 1957 the salary of the Solicitor-General for Scotland has50
been  3,750 a year.   This also is an inclusive salary and he is barredfrom undertaking any private work.   Both Officers, if they are Membersof the House of commons, have since 1957 been entitled to draw an allowance of  750 in respect of their membership of the House.147* lb is clear to us that at these levels of salaries recruitment to the Scottish Law offices of suitable members of the Scottish Barinvolves a quite unwarranted measure of financial sacrifice.   unless these levels are substantially raised, it will become more and moredifficult to find men of the necessary quality who are willing to give up their practice at the Bar and to accept the political andadministrative burdens of these offices.   In our judgement the salaries of the Lord Advocate and of the Solicitor-General for Scotland shouldbe raised to  11,000 and  7,500 respectively, plus in each case 1,250 in respect of membership of the House of Commons, and we sorecommend.OFFICERS OF BOTH HOUSES (OTHER THAN MR. SPEAKER),THE LEADERS OF THE OPPOSITION AND THE OPPOSITIONWHIPS IN BOTH HOUSES148. We add some observations upon these various offices not because we think that any of them are within our terms of reference but because either the remuneration of some of them may be affected by ourforegoing recommendations or they have been the subject of a substantial body of evidence tendered to us.149* The first category includes the remunerated offices in theHouse of Lords of the Lord Chairman of Committees and in the House ofCommons of the Chairman and of the Deputy Chairman of Ways and Meansand of the Leader of the Opposition.   None of these offices appears tous to fall within our terms of reference but on the footing of anincrease in ministerial salaries we believe that it will be recognisedthat there is a need for consequential changes in the remuneration ofthese offices.   We draw attention to the matter which we think may beleft to be the subject of appropriate consideration and of such action as may be thought desirable.150. The second category includes a number of offices not at presentremunerated at all but for the remuneration of which a case was presented to us.   These offices, so far as that term is appropriate, arethose of the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords and the51
Chief and other Opposition Whips in both Houses.   The question ofremunerating any of these offices is not within our terms of reference and we express no view upon it.   We desire only to state briefly theeffect of the evidence given to us in case the matter is thought worthy of further consideration.151* The case for remunerating the Leader of the Opposition in theHouse of Lords rested mainly on the contentions that in presentconditions in that House the office had become a full-time occupationof high responsibility; that in the absence of any reward for service(the daily allowance being only a reimbursement of out-of-pocketexpenses) it could be undertaken only by a peer with adequate privatemeans; that this was an anomaly compared with the position in theHouse of Commons where a remuneration for the Leader of the opposition was established in 1937; and that the overall effect of these considerations might be that the House would not receive the advantageof the services of the peer best qualified to undertake the office.   Theobjections to the proposal were based on the tradition of unpaid service in the Upper House, an argument which would carry with it an implication that remuneration should not be granted to one Member of the House inthe absence of a comprehensive scheme for all peers undertaking regularattendances.152. The case for remunerating the Chief Opposition Yiftiips was basedon the contentions that they fulfilled an onerous duty involving full-timeattendance; that their services were a necessary part of the machineryof the business of both Houses and that without the competent performance of the duties placed upon them the work of both Houses would suffer in quality and in expedition,.   The precedent of a salary granted to the leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was again relied on.The case for the remuneration of other Opposition Whips was based to a lesser extent on the same contentions.   The objections to theseproposals in relation to the House of Lords were substantially the sameas those urged in the case of the Leader of the Opposition in that house and in relation to both Houses that remuneration of Opposition&quot;Whips should not be a charge on public funds but should be a matter for the political parties themselves to determine, and if so advised to pay for, and that if the precedent of payment to the Leader ofthe Opposition in the House of Commons was to be extended it was difficult to know where to stop.52
THE ALLOWANCE FOR MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS153. The allowance for Members of the House of Lords was instituted with effect from the 1st July 1957 in pursuance of aResolution moved by the Government in the House of Commons on the9th July 1957-   The purpose of the allowance and its amount were stated in the Resolution in the following terms:&quot;for enabling members of the House of Lords (except theLord Chancellor, the Lord Chairman of Committees and anymember in receipt of a salary as the holder of a Ministerial officewithin the meaning of the said section two / of the House ofGommons Disqualification Act, 1957 7 or of a salary payable out of moneys provided by Parliament under the Ministerial Salaries Act,1946) to recover out of sums voted for the expenses of that House(in addition to the costs of travel for which provision is madepursuant to the said Resolution of this House) any expensescertified by them as incurred for the purpose of attendance atsittings of that House or of Committees of that House, other thansittings for judicial business, within a maximum of three guineasfor each day of such attendance.&quot;154* In further explanation of the nature of the allowance, the R.T.. Hon. R. A. Butler (then Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord Privy Seal) said in moving the Resolution:-^&quot;......The essence of the new arrangement is that a peer is to be reimbursed expenses which he incurs in connection with attendancesat the House of Lords.   He claims his actual expenses, except thathe will not be able to claim more than three guineas for eachsitting day.   Each peer will have to certify from time to time that,in connection with a specified number of attendances, he hasincurred such and such expenses.&quot;As announced in the Press today and in the HANSARD of another place, it will be seen that plans will be made between theparties in another place, through the usual channels, to ensurethat such arrangements are duly and properly kept.   I am satisfiedthat such commonsense arrangements will work.   The certificatewill be accepted without vouching of any kind, which, I think, isthe only way of doing these things.   There will be no question of producing bills or any other evidence, which, I think, would beundignified.&quot;The expenses which may be included in the claim are allout-of-pocket expenses due to attendance at the House, other thanthe cost of rail travel, which is already separately reimbursed.The claims can, therefore, cover not only subsistence costs - suchas hotel charges and meals - but also miscellaneous travelling costssuch as taxi fares and bus fares, if a peer goes on a bus, or thecost of any other form of transport.   The arrangement, therefore,will cover what amounts to only a daily allowance to ourdistinguished brethren in another place.Hansard, 9th July 1957, col. 227.Hansard, 9th July 1957, cols. 231-32.53
&quot;&quot;we wish in many ways that we could have made it more, hutwe have had to pay attention to the normal amount of expenseallowance drawn by people on official public duty, and if we had gone higher than that amount it would have been essential toenter the realm of a tax allowance.   If we keep to this amount,it is unnecessary, in comparison with the equivalent allowance to persons on official public duty, to enter into that realmand we think it the best way of satisfying the Inland Revenue,and, we hope, of satisfying the peers.&quot;155. The Members of the House of Lords who claim the allowance, notbeing in receipt of any salary or remuneration in respect of their parliamentary duties, are not subject to tax on the allowance.   Noquestion arises of justifying the nature of the expenses incurred inaccordance with criteria of allowable expenses under Schedule E which apply to expenses claimed by Members of the House of Commons against their parliamentary remuneration.   In this respect the allowance differs from any allowance paid by way of remuneration for service, which wouldbe subject to assessment for tax purposes as earned income and against which only those expenses admissible under Schedule E could be claimed.156. Me received various proposals for increasing the maximum amount of the allowance and also proposals for paying, in addition to orin substitution of the allowance, some form of remuneration to Membersof the House of Lords.   We are not satisfied that on a properconstruction of our terms of reference the latter type of proposalfalls within the scope of our enquiry and for this reason alone weshould hesitate, even if we were so minded, to make any recommendation on the subject.   So much evidence, however, has been submitted to usboth in support of and against the proposal that it is clearly amatter very much in the minds of those who have called our attention1 to it.   For this reason we think that perhaps we may be permitted tostate briefly the viev/s which we have formed.157. In the first place it should be made clear that no one has suggested to us that all Members of the House of Lords, now numberingnearly 1,000, or even all Members other than those who apply for and receive leave of absence, should without any attendance test receiveremuneration.   Most of the proposals we received were to the effectthat an attendance allowance in respect of each day of attendanceshould be paid only to Members who attended for a stated number orproportion of days during the parliamentary sessions.   Some suggestionsadded to this the further point that the amount of the daily attendance allowance should be increased proportionately with the number of days ofattendance.158. All such proposals, however, seemed to us to give rise to54
constitutional difficulties.   In the first place, the point was made to us that payment of remuneration to the Members of an assembly not elected by popular vote is, to put the matter no higher, a constitutional innovationon which Parliament itself should pronounce before we make any recommendations.   Secondly, we ourselves think that for us to recommend the basis on which discrimination should be exercised on the matterof which Members should and which should not receive remuneration mightwell amount to a recommendation on the reform of the House of Lords itself.159. The proposals put before us for paying some form of remuneration to Members of the House of Lords seemed to us to giverise also to practical difficulties in relation to taxation.   As wehave indicated above, if remuneration were paid, those Members whoreceived it would be regarded as holding an office of profit of whichthe emoluments would be taxable under Schedule E of the Income TaxActs and the place where they exercised their office would be solelyWestminster, because Members of the House of Lords, unlike Members ofthe House of Commons, have no constituencies.   It would follow fromthis that the expenses which would be allowable as deductions for income tax purposes from this remuneration would not include the costof travel to or of staying in London.160. Eor these reasons, which are partly constitutional and partlypractical, even if the phrase in our terms of reference &quot;the allowancefer Members of the House of Lords&quot; could be interpreted to includeremuneration, we should have reached the conclusion that it was aninnovation which we could not recommend.161 . We therefore turn to the question of the allowance to Membersof the House of Lords which is expressly included in our terms ofreference.162. Our terms of reference require us to review and to recommendwhat changes are desirable in this allowance, having regard to thematters set out in these terms of which the one most relevant andmaterial is the increase in expenses borne by Members in the dischargeof their duties.163. It is essential, in our opinion, that the nature of this allowance should be clearly understood.   We have already cited the wording of the Resolution in the House of Commons by which it was instituted and we have quoted from the speech of Mr. Butler in movingthe Resolution.   Both these extracts define the nature of the paymentbut we are not satisfied that there is not still some popularmisconception outside the House of what the allowance is.   It is not a55
remuneration for public service: it merely establishes a maximumdaily allowance against which a peer may recover in cash the actualamount of his expenses incurred for the purpose of attending sittings of the House or its Committees.   All that is required administrativelyis a certificate signed by the peer himself certifying the amount ofthese expenses, which cannot be reimbursed to him at a rate higherthan three guineas a day.164. Thus it is clear that the intention behind the allowance wasnot to provide any remuneration or reward for service: it was simply togrant a refund of actual out-of-pocket expenses within a daily limit.165. It is possible for some ingenuity of argument to be displayedon the nature of the expenses intended to be covered by the allowanceby construing the varying phraseology by which it has been described.The Resolution used the words &quot;for the purpose of attendance atsittings of that House&quot;; Mr. Butler referred to expenses incurred&quot;in connection with attendances at the House of Lords&quot; and to &quot;out-of-poaketexpenses due to attendance at the House&quot;, and the certificate, of whichwe have been furnished with a blank copy, refers to expenses &quot;inrespect of&quot; attendance.   We do not propose to embark on the refinementsof reasoning which might expand or contract the scope of the allowance:we take as the basis of our enquiry the actual words of the Resolutionitself &quot;for the purpose of attendance at sittings of that House or of committees of that House&quot;.   These words may have been intended to contain a somewhat narrower meaning than may possibly be construed fromthe various glosses mentioned above.   Whether or not this is so, the weight of the evidence submitted to us on this matter was to the effectthat the maximum of three guineas a day was now inadequate to achieve the purpose of the allowance.   We agree with this evidence.   So faras the allowance is intended to be available to cover the out-of-pocketexpenses of a peer not resident in London but incurred for thepurpose of attending sittings of the House, we are fully satisfiedthat three guineas a day in present circumstances is not nearly enough.Whether it was enough in 1957 is not a question which we need determinebut it is perhaps significant that at that time Mr. Butler said:&quot;We wish in many ways that we could have made it more&quot;.   One of thereasons given for not making it more was that any higher figure wouldhave necessitated entry into &quot;the realm of a tax allowance&quot;.   We are clearly of opinion that to achieve its object the allowance should beraised substantially and that the appropriate figure now to be substitutedfor the three guineas is four and a half guineas.   Accordingly we sorecommend.   Any reasonable calculation at current prices of subsistence56

We hope that we have made clear the reasons for our recommendations and why we think that this added cost should be acceptedby the nation as an unavoidable incident of good government.   In thefield of our review much has remained unchanged for generations; wherechanges have been made, the changes have not matched the profound shiftsin social and economic factors.   A radical change over the whole fieldis needed and we believe that the time for that change is at hand.   Theadded financial burden will not, we think, be high compared with thecost of many public projects, the need for which is to-day readilyaccepted.   Our recommendations should set no norms for other callingsbecause this service stands alone in the nature of the work it demands.They should reduce the danger that men and women of the highestability will be turned away by lack of means to adopt it and they maycontributs to the strengthening of our democratic institutions ofgovernment.169. Finally we desire to record our great appreciation of the service which we have received from our secretariat,Miss Mildred Riddelsdell, Mr. A. H. Dangerfield and the Hon. Celia Herbert.This Report would not be complete without an expression of ourgratitude to them for the valuable help which they have given us at all stages in our work.(sgd)   Geoffrey LawrenceH. S.

On the death of a married male Member of theHouse of Commons with ten or more years&apos; reckonable service, hiswidow should receive an immediate pension equal to one-half of the pension, calculated on the length of the Member&apos;s reokonableservice, to which he would have become entitled if he had ceased tobe a Member on the day of his death, or, if he was under age 65,
APPENDIX Dif he had attained that age and had ceased to he a Member on theday of his death.   If a former male Member entitled to pension diesand leaves a widow, she should receive a pension equal to one-halfof the pension to which her deceased husband was entitled.   If a former male Member with ten or more years&apos; reoVnmbl0 service diesbefore attaining age 65 and leaves a widow she should receive animmediate pension equal to one-half of the pension, calculated on the length of her deceased husband&apos;s reckonable service, to whichhe would have been entitled if he had attained age 65 on the day ofhis death.
