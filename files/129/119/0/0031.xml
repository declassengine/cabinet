2226^010 Downing Street, S. W. 1.23rd December, 1964..........&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;59&apos;C. (64) 31 COPY NO._23rd December, 1964CABINETCHRISTMAS, 1964Note by the Prime minister should like to take this opportunity to wish all my colleagues in the Government a very happy Christmas.I hope that we can all feel that, having regard to thecircumstances which we found when we came into office, we have not done too badly since 16th October.     We have launched important newinitiatives in economic and industrial policy, in defence and foreignpolicy and in the field of the social services; and in many other respects we have set in hand a good deal of work, which will bear fruitin due course, to achieve the objectives which we set ourselves in our election Manifesto.    We must maintain this momentum; and we mustbe ready to tackle 1965 with no less energy and determination.Meanwhile I trust that all my colleagues will have a well-earnedrest over the holiday.    I hope that they will also take the opportunityto do a little quiet stock-taking in the light of the first few weeks of office and to consider how we can improve still further our handling of Government business.    I suggest that, among other things, weshould all study afresh the memorandum on Questions of procedure for Ministers (C. (64) 1) which I circulated on 19th October, 1964.I know that Ministers were very busy at the time   when it was circulated and now is a good time to look at it again.    It contains alot of valuable guidance, which has been tested by experience;   andit gains added force when it is re-read against the background of a fewmonths of practical Ministerial responsibility.    The sections dealingwith contacts with the Press, television and public opinion in generalare particularly worth attention.    Recently, there have been one ortwo occasions when information about our intentions seems to haveleaked prematurely; and this kind of thing, if it continues, is not onlybad in itself but tends to undermine the whole concept of collective responsibility.&apos;    I ask my colleagues to take particular care in thisrespect;  and I would suggest that, for their own protection, theyshould preferably be accompanied by some responsible  witness whenthey meet representatives of the Press, even if only informally, andthat they  should also ensure that their Departmental information officers are promptly informed of all such meetings and of what has passed on such occasions in order that any follow-up action which maybe necessary can be taken.    A few simple precautions of this kindcan save a lot of subsequent trouble.H. W.
