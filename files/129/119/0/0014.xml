SECRET .        jHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)50C. (64) 14 COPY NO. _11th November, 1964CABINETREMUNERATION OF MINISTERS AND MEMBERS OF parliament memorandum by the Lord President of the council at the Prime Minister&apos;s request a small Committee under my chairmanship has given preliminary consideration to some of the questions raised by the report of the Lawrence Committee.    Our conclusions arebriefly as follows -Salaries and Allowances of Members of parliament ,       We started from the assumption that the recommendation toincrease the salaries and allowances, including travelling allowances, ofMembers of Parliament should be accepted and implemented with retro-spective effect from the beginning of this Parliament,Pensions for Members of Parliament3.       The details of the pension scheme proposed by the lawrence committee will have to be examined, but it will be important to accept atonce that there should be a contributory scheme and to make a firm state-ment of our intention to introduce it as rapidly as possible.    We would hope that the Bill increasing Ministers&apos; salaries would also provide thelegislative basis for a pensions scheme for Members and that it would be debated on. the same day as the Resolution increasing Members&apos; salaries.It might then be possible to arrange for the Fees Office to hold backMembers&apos; new pension contributions in paying the retrospective portion oftheir increased salaries so that they were not faced later with a demandfor large arrears of contribution.Ministerial Salaries4.       It was suggested to us that there would be advantage in expressingwhatever was thought to be the appropriate increase in Ministers&apos; salaries in terms of a proportion of the increase recommended by the lawrence committee, rather than as a proportion of the existing salary.    It isimportant that we should not lose the advantage to be gained from basingour decisions on the guidance of an independent committee by appearingwholly to reject their advice and to substitute a set figure of our own,apparently unconnected with their recommendations.    The annexed tableprepared by the Treasury indicates for purposes of illustration how thefigures would work out if we increased the existing salaries by half theamount of the increase recommended by the Lawrence Committee.      Thefigures to be fixed by statute should be those appropriate to the responsibilities of the post,5.       The scales of pension for the Prime Minister and the LordChancellor will also have to be considered.-1-
The Speaker6,       We considered that The Speaker&apos;s salary should be increased by whatever proportion of either the existing salary or the increaserecommended by the Lawrence Committee we decided to adopt for Ministers.The tax-free allowance for expenses, on which the Lawrence Committeemerely commented that if the figure of  4, 000 fixed in 1928 was right then it is unlikely to be right now, will need to be discussed with The Speaker,who can no doubt say what the existing expenditure attributable to his office now is.    The amount of his pension also requires further considera-tion, as does the question whether it should be fixed by statute, as the lawrence Committee recommend, or by ad hoc Resolution of the House ofCommons in the light of the length of service rendered by a particularindividual.    Neither of these points need be settled immediately.Chairman and Deputy Chairmen of Ways and Means and Lord Chairmanof Committees7.       These salaries should rise by the same amount as the ministerial salaries to which they are linked.Allowances for Members of the House of Lords8.       The Lawrence Committee recommended that the attendance allowance paid to Members of the House of Lords should be increased from 3 guineas to 4-jr guineas for each day&apos;s attendance.    The InlandRevenue would continue to treat an allowance of 4^ guineas as tax free,since it would be reasonable to suppose that expenses of this order wereincurred, but they would not be able so to regard a substantially higherallowance.    This recommendation should accordingly be accepted.9.       Our attention was drawn to the fact that junior Ministers in theHouse of Lords are not entitled to draw an attendance allowance ortravelling expenses, on the ground  that expenditure incurred intravelling to and staying in London is incurred in connection with their employment as Ministers, and not for the purpose of attendance at theHouse of Lords.    It was suggested to us that, since some parliamentary secretaries live at a considerable distance from London and are compelled to stay in hotels during the week, they should continue to beentitled to draw the allowance on the days when they actually attend theHouse of Lords in the course of their duties.     This, however, would introduce a new principle not in keeping with the recommendations of the lawrence Committee and might well give rise to taxation difficultieswhich would have to be examined if it were desired to enable junior ministers to draw the House of Lords allowance.Leader of the Opposition and Opposition Chief Whip in the House of Lords10.      In the Commons  the Leader of the Opposition is now paid the sameas a Minister of State ( 3,750).    This equation should continue.    ministers have already expressed the view that the salary of the Opposition chief whip could appropriately be the same as that of a Parliamentary Secretary.11.      In the Lords the Lawrence Committee recorded evidence given tothem to the effect that since the full-time services of the Leader of theOpposition and the Opposition Chief Whip were necessary to the dischargeof the business of the House, both should be paid on the analogy of the leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons.    Figures that havebeen suggested are  1, 500 for the Leader of the Opposition and  1, 000for the Opposition Chief Whip - plus in each case the daily attendance allowance.
12.       These proposals are under discussion with the Opposition and theirviews will be reported to the Cabinet.Timing13.       The Bill to increase Ministerial salaries and to introducecontributory pensions for Members of Parliament should be debated on thesame day as the Resolution increasing Members&apos; salaries.    The Resolutionought to be taken before Christmas, but there will be advantage in introducing the Bill as late as possible in order to allow time for thoroughconsideration of the pensions scheme.     We propose, therefores to take theSecond Reading of the Bill and the Resolution in the week beginning14th December.    This will follow the Second Reading on the Pensions(Increase) Bill which we   expect to take in the first week of December.Summary14.       The matters for decision now are:-(1)    Confirmation of acceptance of the increases in the salaries and allowances, including travelling allowances, of Members ofParliament recommended in the Lawrence Committee and theirimplementation with retrospective effect from the beginning ofthis Parliament.(2)   Acceptance in principle of a contributory pension scheme for members of Parliament.(3)   Determination of a scale of salaries for Ministers, related  .as far as possible to the Lawrence recommendationsu&apos;^4be(4)   Consequential decisions on salaries of -(a) Mr. Speaker(b) The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Ways and Meansand Lord Chairman of Committees(c) Leader of the Opposition in the Commons(5)   Increase in attendance allowance of Members of the House ofLords from 3 guineas to 4-j guineas a day.(6)   Decision whether the allowance should be extended to Ministers.(7)   Confirmation of the decision to pay a salary to the OppositionChief Whip in the Commons, equal to that of a parliamentary secretary.(8)   Decision on salaries for the Leader of the Opposition and opposition Chief Whip in the House of Lords.(9)   Inclusion of Members&apos; salaries and Members&apos; pension scheme in one bill  to have its Second Reading on the same day (before christmas but after the Second Reading of the Pensions (Increase)Bill) as the Resolution increasing Members&apos; salaries is debated.H.
