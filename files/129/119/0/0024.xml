C.(64) 24 COPY NO.1st December, 1964CABINET53700th ANNIVERSARY OF parliament memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilAlthough historians are not all agreed, it is widely accepted thatour present Parliamentary system can be said to date from the parliament summoned by Simon de Montfort on 20th January, 1265.   the queen&apos;s Speech at the opening of Parliament referred to the 700thanniversary of Parliament occurring in 1965.2.       There have been three Parliamentary Questions on the subjectso far, and on 18th November I said in the House that the government intended to mark the anniversary and were considering the most appropriate way in which it could be commemorated.3.      I was invited by the Prime Minister to consider what form anycelebrations might take and in discussion with those of our colleaguesmost immediately concerned it was agreed that the 20th January mightitself be marked by some simple Parliamentary ceremony (on the dayitself if Parliament is sitting, or if not, as soon as possible thereafter).For example the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker might address theirrespective Houses of Parliament and a small exhibition might be set upin the Library of the House.    The day might also be celebrated in the schools.4.       We support a proposal, which we understand the Postmaster-General is considering, of issuing a special commemorative stamp.5.       We also need to consider whether more extensive celebrationsshould be held later in the year, preferably to coincide with thecelebrations which are already planned for June, 1965 to mark the750th anniversary of Magna Carta,    On the assumption that they should,we need to consider (a) the scale of the celebrations and (b) themachinery for carrying the plans forward.6.       There is little in the way of precedent as a guide to the possiblescale of celebrations.    Presumably, if anything is done at all it willhave to be fairly lavish and the event regarded as a major international and Commonwealth parliamentary occasion.    We could hardly do lessthan was done on the occasion of the 46th Inter-Parliamentary Conferencein 1957 which was opened by The Queen in Westminster Hall and included a reception for the heads of delegations in the Speaker&apos;sResidence in the presence of The Queen, a reception by the LordChancellor and the Speaker in the House of Lords, a reception by theGovernment in St. James&apos;s Palace, a solemn mass in WestminsterCathedral, a special Church of England service in St. Margaret&apos;s,  and-1-
such ancillary activities as a trip down the river to Greenwich, acelebrity concert in the Festival Hall and a reception at the Guildhall.Celebrations on this sort of scale might cost something in the region of 10, 000-  15, 000 and my colleagues will wish to consider whetherexpenditure of this order could be justified.    It is to be hoped that thecelebrations would encourage a large number of visitors to London with consequent benefits to the Exchequer?   and they would provide our overseas information services with some useful material in the way offilms and literature.7.      Since the occasion would be mainly a Parliamentary one, itwould seem appropriate that the general supervision of the necessary arrangements should be undertaken by a parliamentary committee underthe chairmanship of the Speaker of which the Lord Chancellor togetherwith the Leaders and Chief Whips of the parties in both Houses wouldbe among the members.    The practical arrangements would probablyfall largely within the responsibilities of the Minister of Public building and Works although the departmental interests of several other ministers and the interests of various organisations would also be involved.    Itmight be thought appropriate that, under the general guidance of the speaker&apos;s Committee, the Minister of Public Building and Works shouldbe asked to make himself responsible for the detailed planning of thearrangements in consultation with his colleagues and outside organisationsas necessary.8.      I recommend therefore -(a) That on 20th January, 1965 if Parliament is sitting, or as soon as possible thereafter if it is not, there shouldbe a simple Parliamentary ceremony to mark the callingby Simon de Montfort of the Parliament of 1265, and thatthe day might also be marked in the schools throughoutthe country.(b) That a commemorative stamp should be issued.(c) That the anniversary should be further celebrated on asubstantial scale during June, 1965 concurrently with thecelebrations of the 750th anniversary of Magna Carta.(We shall no doubt need to announce our plans for these further celebrations on 20th January. )(d) That the Speaker should be asked to take the chair of a parliamentary committee charged with the general supervision of the arrangements.(e) That the Minister of Public Building and Works shouldbe asked to accept responsibility for the detailed planning of the arrangements in consultation withhis colleagues and with outside interests as necessary.Whitehall, S. W. 1.1st December, 1964-2-
