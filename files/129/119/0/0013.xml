THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC M A JEST Y&apos;S government (64) 13 Copy No. ! 5 311th November, 1964...   CABINETCROWN PRIVILEGEMemorandum by the Prime minister am concerned at the extent to which Crown Privilege is claimed to prevent the disclosure of official documents which private persons wish to see either in the course of litigation between themselves or with Government Departments. I believe some reduction in these claims could be made. Whether or not individuals in general suffer as a result of these claims may be difficult todetermine, but public opinion tends to assume that they do and thatthe claims are made to prevent mistakes made by Ministers and officials from coming to light.2. In order to deal with these suspicions I have asked the LordChancellor to arrange that as soon as possible the Law ReformCommittee should consider, as part of their inquiry into the Law ofEvidence, the whole question of Crown Privilege and the grounds on which it may be claimed. The Lord Chancellor will announce this in answer to a Question in the House of Lords.3. One of the main questions that the Committee will have toconsider is whether or not claims to Privilege should continue to bemade by Ministers in respect of documents which must, as a class,
2 CONFIDENTIALbe withheld from production if Ministers and officials are to conduct public affairs with freedom and candour. I am satisfied thatno interim arrangement to provide for the disclosure of such documents should be made, and meanwhile Ministers shouldcontinue to put forward claims for &quot; class &quot; documents as hitherto.4. There is, however, a small group of documents whereDepartments claim Crown Privilege not because they belong to a&quot; class &quot; which is to be withheld, but because of the contents of theindividual paper. Some of these concern security matters. Beforeclaims are made on security grounds I should like my colleagues infuture to consult me and to indicate the scope of the documents tobe withheld and the reasons why Privilege is to be claimed. Enoughinformation should be provided to enable me to form a view of the merits of the case. The actual decision including the legal formalitiesinvolved should continue to be made by the Departmental minister concerned.5. This procedure will also be announced by the LordChancellor.H. W.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,11th November, 1964.CONFIDENTIAL
