HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)C.(64) 420th October, 1964CABINETPU3LIC expenditure note by the Chancellor of the exchequer am circulating this note, following yesterday&apos;s Cabinet meeting, toset out the immediate action to be taken about public expenditure.2.       First, and most important, we are agreed that this Government willtake the expenditure decisions together, and not piecemeal.    Our expendituredecisions will then fit into a coherent plan.3.       Second, the commitments already entered into by the previous government have already mortgaged the prospective increase of revenuebased on a 4 per cent growth rate;   so that our new proposals will have to be matched by raising additional revenue - unless of course we can get somebig immediate savings.4.       We shall need to outline our expenditure policies in The Queen&apos;sSpeech, and I ask my colleagues to let me have by Thursday eveningestimates of the cost of their proposals in 1965-66 and in a full year.   Weshall need to work on a full public expenditure basis, and not simplyexpenditure from Votes.   I will arrange a meeting early next v/eek to sortthese out, and so to give us the basis for deciding which proposals shall go forward in The Queen&apos;s Speech.5.       We shall then have to consider the 1965-66 Estimates.  I shall be grateful if these can be submitted to the Treasury by 1st December.   As we agreed, my colleagues, in submitting them, will distinguish between thecost of new policies and the cost of the policies already going on.6.       I know that my colleagues will go through their Estimates with great care, and cut them right down;   and there may well be wasteful expendituresembarked upon by our predecessors, of low social priority, which could be eliminated straight away.7.       We shall also have to look at the longer period of expenditurecommitments,  covering actual expenditures in the period from 1964-65 to1963-69. There is now a regular process of annual reviews of public expenditure four years ahead;   and I have asked the Treasury to arrange for thestimates made earlier this year to be revised and brought forward in thenext weeks so that by the time the difficult decisions on the Estimates have tobe taken, we shall be able to do this in the light of the forward situation.-1-C  copy NO.

8.       I therefore ask my colleagues to;-(i)    let me have by Thursday evening the financial implications of the proposals which they wish to include in The queen sSpeech;(ii)    submit their Estimates by 1st December distinguishing betweenthe cost of new policy and the cost of existing services;(iii)    cut down their Estimates as far as possible, with particular regard to cutting out services of low priority.L. J. C.Treasury Chambers,  S, W, 120th October, 1964-2-
