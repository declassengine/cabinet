sCR^147C.(64) 8COPY NO.28th October, 1964CABINETPROPOSALS FOR EXPENDITURE:AN INCREASE IN SOCIAL SECURITY benefits memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceWe are all agreed that we should give priority to improvements in the social field.    Our more radical plans for a fully graduatedsystem and our proposals for Income Guarantee will take time to workout in detail.     The need to make an immediate impact in this field hasled me to conclude that we ought to proceed immediately with anall-round increase in social security benefits.     This v/ould be inaccordance with the undertaking in our Manifesto that these benefitswill be raised.     There is in any event a good case on general grounds for an increase in these benefits.     It is now about eighteen monthssince they were last increased, and the present rates are steadilylosing value.   For technical reasons, about four months is theminimum period needed from the presentation of a Bill to bring new rates of benefit into operation.    In fact, the earliest date by whichwe can expect to get higher rates into payment is the beginning ofApril next year, which will be nearly two years after the last increase.2.       Another factor v/hich we have to take into account is that under existing legislation national insurance contributions are due to go up atthe beginning of next April without any accompanying increases in benefits.     This is the first of the four quinquennial increases in contributions provided for in the 1959 Act to meet the growing costof retirement pensions.     Legislation would be necessary to avoid this happening.    If we go now for an all round increase in benefits,we can deal with the contribution position at the same time in the waybest fitted to our own plans.The amount of a national insurance increase3.       The immediate question which arises is the amount of theincrease to be made in the standard rate of national insurance benefit.I estimate that by next April the rise in the cost of living, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, since the last increase inMay, 1963, will justify an addition of about 5s. on the standard rateof 67s. 6d.      But in recent years increases in national insurancerates have been made by reference to the rise in average earningsrather than merely the rise in prices.    It would be difficult for usto take a lower standard.     The rise in earnings by next April sincethe last increase in benefits is expected to be about 13l per cent which would justify an increase in the 67s. 6d. rate of very nearly10s.     This seems to me to be the absolute minimum increase we
could make next April.    In fact, I propose that we should do a little better than this and provide for an increase of 12s. 6d. , giving a new standard rate of  4 a week for the single person.     This wouldprovide us with a rate of benefit which we could reasonbly expect tohold for a long enough period to develop our more radical plans.But I am not thinking only in terms of tactical advantage.    In ourManifesto, we made a point of saying that social security benefitshave been allowed to fall below minimum levels of human need andby doing rather better than would be necessary to match the rise in earnings we should be manifestly making a start to put matters right.4.       Although an increase of 12s. 6d. in the standard rate wouldbe the largest increase in cash terms since 1948, it would not be asbig a percentage as the 10s. increase on  2 to  2.  10s. in 1958 sothat we could hardly be accused of profligacy.    Moreover the last of the Conservative Government&apos;s increases in May,  1963 set a precedent for improving benefits beyond the rise in earnings.    The10s. increase then introduced was about three times what the increasein the Retail Prices Index and twice what the increase in average earnings would have justified.      The circumstances were special inthat the increase followed the period of the pay pause, which hadartificially limited the increase in prices and earnings, but even allowing for this an increase in benefits somewhat beyond the risein earnings could be defended on this precedent.5.       I would propose an increase in the wife&apos;s pension of 8s. 6d.from 41s. 6d. to  2.  10s.     This would give a married couple ajoint pension of  6.  10s. a week.     The increase for a child wouldbe 2s. 6d. from 20s. to 22s. 6d.     The amount for a widow&apos;s childwould go up from 37s. 6d. to 40s.    A corresponding increase in the100 per cent disablement pension rate under the Industrial Injuriesand .7ar Pensions schemes would be 20s. , from 1.15s. to 135s.National Assistance6.       On this occasion I am convinced that an increase in national insurance benefits would have to be accompanied by an increase ofthe same amount in national assistance.     Otherwise the poorestbeneficiaries would not get the full benefit of the increases.Widows7. I would a.j.so propose that we should include in our legislationtwo improvements of widows&apos; benefits.(i)   The 10s.   widow s pensionWe are committed to increasing this pension from 10s. to30s.     There is the possibility of repercussions on other benefits which have not been increased over the years to take account of falling values, in the industrial injuries and war pensions schemes.    But I think weshould be able to resist pressure for otherimprovements, at any rate for the present.

A corresponding increase in the100 per cent disablement pension rate under the Industrial Injuriesand .7ar Pensions schemes would be 20s., from 115s. to 135s.National Assistance6.       On this occasion I am convinced that an increase in national insurance benefits would have to be accompanied by an increase ofthe same amount in national assistance.    Otherwise the poorestbeneficiaries would not get the full benefit of the increases.Widows7. I would a^so propose that we should include in our legislationtwo improvements of widows&apos; benefits.(i)   The 10s.   widow s pensionWe are committed to increasing this pension from 10s. to30s.     There is the possibility of repercussions on other benefits which have not been increased over the years to take account of falling values, in the industrial injuries and war pensions schemes.    But I think weshould be able to resist pressure for otherimprovements, at any rate for the present.SECRET
(ii)   The earnings rules for widowsWe are similarly committed to abolishing the earningsrules for widows.     This, too, cannot be done withoutthe risk of repercussions.    Nevertheless, we are soclearly committed to abolition of the earnings rules for widows that I think we must take this early opportunityto discharge our undertaking.    We shall have to holdoff pressure for further changes until we can producecur more fundamental proposals for reconstruction ofthe provisions for social security.cost.       The approximate cost of these proposals in the first year would be as follows -Extra cost   millionNational Insurance 271Industrial, injuries 13War pensions 16National assistance 24324Of these costs, those for war pensions and national assistance would fall on the Exchequer, and the national insurance and industrial injuries costs would be met mainly from contributions, withExchequer support.Contr ibutions9t.       Since 1959, higher benefits have been financed partly bydevelopment of the graduated scheme of national insurance contributions and benefits.     We have strongly criticised thisscheme in the past, and we must examine it closely before we seeexactly how we want to develop it in the future.    On this occasion,therefore, I am convinced that we ought to look for our extraincome to the flat-rate contributions, with the usual exchequer support.10.      Another factor is the quinquennial increases in contributionsreferred to in paragraph 2.     The number of pensioners will be growing steadily up till about 1980, and under the pay-as-you-gosystem the extra cost of these pensions was to be met by putting upcontributions at five-yearly intervals between 1965 and 1980.     Theresult would have been to put the Fund in surplus in 1965-66, and to achieve an approximate balance of income and expenditure over thefollowing 5 years until the next quinquennial increase.     the increases in contributions were to include 5d. a side (that is 5d. eachby the employer and employee) on the general flat-rate contribution,and 4 per cent a side on the rate (at present 4^ per cent a side) atc** pa /a) Efft fF&quot;^^SeCRc I
which the graduated contribution is now collected on earnings between  9 and  18 a week.    I propose that the 1965 quinquennialincreases should be absorbed into the higher contributions whichwill be needed next April to finance the higher benefits.    Most ofthe income we should get from them will in any case be neededbecause of the growing number of pensioners, if we are to keep theFund in balance over the following 5 years, but for the reasons give in the previous paragraph I would not propose to increase therate of graduated contribution on this occasion.11.       To achieve a balance over 5 years by a conventional increasein the flat-rate contributions, with Exchequer support according tothe fori-.aula in the 1959 Act, would mean raising the man&apos;s national insurance contribution by 2s. 8d. a side.    (Under the 1959 formula,the Exchequer would then contribute about  70 million extra to theNational Insurance Funds as well as meeting the cost of higher warpensions and national assistance. )    In my judgment, 2s. 8d. on top of the rrian&apos;s present contribution of 11s. 8d. would be too heavy a burden to place on the individual contributor, particularly the lowwage earner.    I do not think his contribution should be increasedby more than about 2s.     Even this would be a good deal sharperincrease than we have had in the past, apart from 1958 when the contribution also v/ent up by 2s;  but I think it would be tolerableto finance the kind of benefit increase I am now proposing.     the woman&apos;s contribution would be increased in proportion by Is. 9d.to become 11s. 5d.12.       The contribution increases could be kept down to these levels and the Fund maintained in reasonable balance over the next5 years if the employer&apos;s contribution v/ere put up rather more thanproportionately, that is by 3s. 3d.    If this were thought too great a burden on industry at the present time, it would, I think, be possibleto mitigate it to some extent.     The present increase in benefits is a holding operation until we have time for a more radical examinationof the national insurance scheme.     This will necessarily meanexamining its contribution structure and the sources of income.     Wecould, perhaps, therefore justify raising only sufficient extra income to maintain the Fund in balance over the next 2 to 3 years while wedevelop our future plans.    On this footing, the increase in theemployer1 s contribution could be kept down to something like 2s. 6d.This would mean, however, that we should be getting by merely fora short period with the prospect of correspondingly biggercontribution increases next time.13.      I think that on merit there are good reasons for asking the employer to pay a bigger share of the stamp.    At presentemployer and employee pay roughly equal amounts towards thecost of national insurance and industrial injuries.    However, the health Service contribution, which is also part of the stamp, fallspreponderantly on the employee, who in the case of a man pays2s. 8-jrd. to the employer&apos;s 7-ld.     Therefore, my proposal to putmore weight upon the employer means that we should be movingsome way towards a more equal distribution of the cost of thestamp.     One way of achieving this aim would be to increase the
insurance contribution for a male worker by about 2s. 8d. a sidebut shift 8d. of the employee&apos;s National Health service contribution onto his employer.    Before we finally decide thenew contribution structure I should like to explore this devicewith my colleagues directly concerned.CONCLUSION14. I seek the approval of my colleagues for my proposals,would remind them that, if the requirements of the timetable Ihave suggested are to be met, we must take decisions quickly.M.H.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, &quot;W.C, 2.28th October,  1964
