TRADE DISPUTES BILL (ROOKES v. BARNARD) AND an inquiry INTO TRADE UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS&apos;ASSOCIATIONSMemorandum by the Minister of LabourTrade Disputes BillIn accordance with the undertaking given by the Prime minister before the Election, the Queen&apos;s Speech promised a Bill during this session to give workers and their representatives the protectionnecessary for freedom of industrial negotiation. The need for legislation arises from the House of Lords decision in the case ofRookes v. Barnard. According to this decision a worker who bythreatening to strike in breach of his contract of employment is thecause of injury being done to another may be sued in tort (the tortof &quot; intimidation&quot;) for damages. Trade union officials who are associated with workers in making such threats may likewise be sued.The full implications of the decision are not clear but it seems thatstrikes of many different kinds may be affected and not just strikesover the closed shop as in the case of Rookes. Certainly the TradesUnion Congress consider that trade union officials are generallyhampered in their activities, and they have been pressing for an amendment to the law.2. The effects of the decision can be negatived quite simplyby providing in a short Bill that in the circumstances of a trade dispute it is not actionable in tort to threaten to break a contract of employment or to threaten to induce another to break such a contract.3. It has been suggested, e.g., by Professor Wedderburn, thatthe implications of the decision go wider than the circumstances oftrade disputes and that any amendment of the law ought to take account of this. These larger questions may well deserve study butin my view it is out of the question to delay action in the trade unionfield until such a wider examination can be carried out.4. I propose that the Bill apply to proceedings brought in theCourts after it becomes law, even if the proceedings are in regardto causes of action arising before the Bill becomes law. This means that the Bill will have some retrospective effect. I propose this degreeof retrospection because without it proceedings brought after the5168Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1964C.

passage of the Act, in respect of causes of action arising before,would have to be decided according to the present obscure stateof the law, despite the fact that the law would have been clarifiedby the Act. My proposal would permit proceedings started beforethe passage of the Act to be settled in accordance with the law asit is now. I think this is a reasonable compromise.5. I shall have discussions with the Trades Union congress and the British Employers&apos; Confederation before the Bill is published.Inquiry into trade unions and employers&apos; associations6. The decision of the Trades Union Congress to agree to an inquiry into the trade unions will enable us to answer criticism thatthe Bill will encourage trade unions to threaten breaches of contract and to take unreasonable action to enforce the closed shop. We canpromise a comprehensive examination of these and other problemsof industrial relations and explain that what the Bill does meanwhileis restore the legal position as it was thought to be until the judgment in Rookes v. Barnard. The issues raised by the decisionof the House of Lords in the case of Stratford v. Lindley can alsobe considered by the Inquiry.7. I propose an inquiry into the more important general problems of industrial relations as well as the specific question oftrade union law. Possible terms of reference are suggested in the annex. I think the inquiry should be made by a Royal Commission.These are vitally important and controversial issues and we need a body of the highest standing. I would like a small commissioncomposed of independents and without &quot; representatives&quot; ofemployers or trade unions but this may not be acceptable to theTrades Union Congress.8. I am at present consulting the Trades Union Congress andthe British Employers&apos; Confederation about the inquiry and I shallaim to get full support from both on its scope and composition.9.  I ask my colleagues to agree that(a) subject to the outcome of my further discussions with theTrades Union Congress and the British Employers&apos;Confederation, I should introduce a Bill amending thepresent state of Trade Union Law as suggested inparagraphs 2 and 4 above, and(b) there should be a Royal Commission to inquire into the role of Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Associations.R. J. G.Ministry of Labour, S.W.1,15th December, 1964.
AnnexPOSSIBLE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR AN inquiry into TRADE UNIONS&quot; To consider the role of trade unions and employers&apos;associations in promoting the interests of their members andadvancing the social and economic well-being of the nation withparticular reference to(a) relations between managements and employees;(b) productivity and efficiency; and(c) the law affecting their activities and to report.&quot;
