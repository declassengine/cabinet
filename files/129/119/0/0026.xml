HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)C.(64) 2611th December, 1964CABINETSALARIES OF THE HIGHER judiciary memorandum by the Lord chancellor the Sub &quot;Committee on Prices and Incomes of the ministerial committee on Economic Development have invited me to seek theapproval of the Cabinet to the Sub - C omm itt e e&apos; s proposals for dealingwith the salaries of the higher judiciary in England and Wales,Scotland and Northern Ireland.2.       The salaries of these Judges are fixed by statute.    The lasttime they were increased was in 1954 and before that they had not hadan increase for 120 years.    By the Judges Remuneration Act, 1954all the Judges concerned were given an increase of  3,000 (with theexception of the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice ofEngland who got  2, 000).    Parliament was then told that the salariesgranted were intended to stand for a generation.    Nevertheless their value has been rapidly eroded, and since 1954 the lower judiciaryhave received three salary increases corresponding to those grantedto the Higher Civil Service.    This has resulted in the gap between the salaries of the higher and lower judiciary becoming unreal!sticallynarrow,3.       The great importance of maintaining the  standard of thehigher judiciary has always been recognised.    I suggest that it isimportant too that the Government should be seen to be ensuring thatit is maintained.    To this end it is essential to recruit the very bestmen to the Bench.    I have reason to believe that the existing salariesare insufficient to make certain of attracting them, though the prestige and dignity of the office and the pension rights attaching to there are powerful inducements.    However that may be, the Lord chief justice has advised both my predecessor and me that the Judgesthemselves now consider that they have very strong claims to anincrease in their salaries.    The Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Home Secretary, who have responsibilities for the salaries of the judges in Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively, agree with methat this is so,4.      My predecessor announced on the 24th March last(Official Report Vol. 256, col. 1130) the then Governments intentionof introducing legislation to increase these salaries during the1964/65 Session.    I am told that before that announcement informal soundings were made as a result of which it had been ascertained that the principle of an increase had been approved by the Parliament-ary Committee of the Labour Party.    It is not suggested, of course,that the approval so given is necessarily binding on the Government,but it is certain that we shall be asked to state our attitude to thisquestion before long.-1-COPY NO.     gQ
secr2055.       The Sub-Committee on Prices and Incomes consider that thereis a case for increasing the salaries of the higher judiciary in thefairly near future, and that the late Governments commitmentshould be honoured.    They have suggested that legislation should beintroduced for this purpose in June or July 1965, but that the increases should not take effect before September.    In reaching this conclusion they took the view that although the recent salary increases for Ministers and Members of Parliament make it more difficult to resist increases for the Judiciary, any announcement about the latter should be deferred until the Governments proposals for an incomes policy have been established.    They therefore considered that thereshould be no public announcement at this stage, but that, if theCabinet agreed with the proposals, I should be authorised to informthe Judges  (and Lord Dilhorne) in confidence.    I should be quitecontent with this plan.6.       The Sub-Committee have not considered what increases shouldbe given to the Judges.    This is a matter which, if the principlewere agreed by the Cabinet, the Secretary of State for Scotland, theHome Secretary  and I would discuss with the Chancellor of theExchequer.    The present salary of a puisne Judge in England andWales is  8, 000.    There are a number of different bases on whichproposals for increases fall to be considered, but I must make it plain that a comparatively substantial increase will have to be grantedif it is to be acceptable to the Judges.    At the same time I should liketo discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer a proposal that in thefuture salary increases for the higher judiciary might be granted by statutory instrument sanctioned by affirmative resolution procedure.This is now the procedure applicable to most of the salaries of thelower judiciary, and I am satisfied that it could be applied to thehigher judiciary without ill effect.When our discussions on these matters are concluded, weshould report back to the Sub-Committee on Prices and Incomes.7. I therefore seek the approval of my colleagues to the following proposals :-(i)  That legislation should be introduced later in the Session toincrease the salaries of the higher judiciary in England andWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.(ii) That the increases so granted, should not take effect before september 1965.(iii) That no public announcement of the governments intentions should be made at present, but that I shouldbe at liberty to inform the Judges privately.(iv) That the Secretary of State for Scotland, the HomeSecretary and I should discuss with the Chancellorof the Exchequer the amount of the increases to begiven and the procedure for giving effect to increases in the future, and that we should report the result ofof our discussions to the Sub-Committee on prices and Incomes of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Development.G.House of Lords, S.

ESTABLISHMENT OF LAW COMMISSIONS FOR ENGLANDAND WALES AND FOR scotland memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the purpose of this paper is to submit to the cabinet proposals for implementing the undertaking given in The Queen&apos;sSpeech to appoint Law Commissioners &quot;to advance reform of the law&quot;.2.       The Home Affairs Committee have considered proposals forthe establishment by statute of a Law Commission for England andWales which would be composed of five lawyers of high standingappointed, with a supporting staff, by the Lord Chancellor.    TheCommission would have the task of planning a systematic review ofthe English law;  carrying out consolidation and statute law revision;putting forward proposals for the reform of particular areas of thelaw; and providing Departments with a research and advisory service, particularly on Commonwealth and foreign lav/.    A similarbody would be appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theLord Advocate jointly to review Scottish law.3.       The Home Affairs Committee consider that bodies with theproposed functions would provide a valuable means of securing the systematic reform of the law.    They think it necessary to ensure,however, that account is taken of the responsibility of departmental ministers for the law within the field for which they are answerable to Parliament, and that the Commissions operate under the iltimate authority of the Cabinet.    For this purpose they propose that the commissions should function on the lines indicated in the Annex.They believe that these arrangements will leave with the Commissionsthe initiative in proposing areas of the law for investigation and willnot impede the achievement of their long-term objectives, but will ensure -(a) that the Minister with departmental responsibility isconsulted on a particular project, on its timing, and on whether it should be carried out by the Commissionthemselves or by another body, such as the HomeSecretary&apos;s Criminal Law Revision Committee, or a departmental Committee appointed ad hoc; and(b) that in the event of disagreement the issue is submittedC.(64) 2711th December, 1964COPY NO.CABINETto the Cabinet.-1-
