HIS DOCUMENT IS. THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (64) 219th October, 1964CABINETMINERAL RIGHTS IN NORTHERN RHODFKTAMemorandum by the Secr.:-;ary of Statefor Commonwealth relations we are faced with the need for an urgent decision, if possible before independence Day on Saturday,  24th October, on the problem of the mineral rights held by the British South Africa Company (Chartered) in northern rhodesia.2.       A historical summary of the problem is annexed.3.        The Northern Rhodesia Government claim that Chartered&apos;s title to the mineral rights is. invalid &quot;ab initio&quot;, and that successive UnitedKingdom Governments have been morally and legally at fault in recognising the title.    They therefore demand that the United Kingdom Governmentshould take steps to relieve them of all responsibility towards Charteredbefore independence:   otherwise they propose to expropriate the companywithout compensation.      They are however prepared to make a &quot;goodwillcontribution&quot; of  2 million towards any settlement provided that theUnited Kingdom Government make at least an equal contribution.4.       It is out of the question for any United Kngdom Government toaccept at this stage the case- of legal and moral responsibility urged against it by the Northern Rhodesia Government.    It is perhaps not surprising thaton two occasions (1923 and 1950) successive administrations - oneConservative and one Labour - decided to reach a compromise settlement on this complicated issue &quot;out of court&quot; rather than test the matterjudicially.    The present Governments position must, in particular, haveregard to the obligation under the 1950 Agreement with Chartered to ensure&quot;so far as it is possible to do so&quot;, when they cease to be responsible for northern Rhodesia that a successor Government continues to abide by theAgreement.   If we were to accept the Northern Rhodesia arguments,Chartered would undoubtedly start litigation against us (and may well do so if no settlement is reached and they are expropriated).5.       On the other hand, it is completely out of line with modern thinkingto allow a country to proceed to independence with its entire mineral wealthowned by a British commercial company;   and we shall be subject to criticism throughout the world if we do not solve the problem before independence.COPY NO,
6.        The Northern Rhodesia Government are fully resolved to terminate the rights of Chartered on independence, if a settlement is not reached:and I am satisified that public opinion in the territory supports them to suchan extent that they would have no difficulty in a referendum for an act ofexpropriation.7.        The latter step would be the beginning of a dangerous chain of developments: -(i)    The referendum would inevitably involve anti-british propaganda, which would be exploited anc! permanentlytaint our relations with what is potentially a very well-disposed new Commonwealth country.(ii)    Two dangerous lines of development could open.    Zambia&apos;scredit in the world might suffer:   and other powers,Eastern or Western, might seize the initiative.   In either case,  the result would be detrimental to our influence and considerable commercial interests in the country.If the effect on Zambia1 s credit was to make it difficult for the West generally to support Zambia, it would afford a major opportunity for extension of the newChinese &quot;cold-war front&quot; in Africa,  to which manyZambian Ministers would be receptive.(iii)    The &quot;bush-fire&quot; effect could lead to popular clamour either for expropriation of the copper companies or nationalisa-tion of mines, which would also afford an opportunity for russian or Chinese help against repayment in copper.We obtain nearly 40 per cent of our imports of copperfrom Northern Rhodesia.   If these supplies were withheld from us, or developments led to a Western boycott ofNorthern Rhodesia, copper prices would soar and therewould be unemployment in Britain.In short, if the issue is not resolved,   Zambia would well be set on apolitical and economic course very different from what we would wish to see.8.        Our broad political interests thereforeargue strongly in favour of a united Kingdom Government initiative to reach a settlement before independence.   In the present situation (with Chartered willing to accept 8 million and the Northern Rhodesia Government willing to contribute 2 million and to negotiate further on a settlement based on &quot;combinedaction&quot; by the two Governments), there is the prospect of a settlement if weare willing to make some contribution towards it.9.        The main difficulties in contributing towards any settlement are:(a) It could be held to imply acceptance of the Northern RhodesiaGovernments contention that legal and moral responsibilityrests on us.-2-
(b) It might be a dangerous precedent with wide repercussions if theUnited Kingdom Treasury were to pay any part of compensation to a British company expropriated by another Government.10.      Both objections (as well as possible political criticism of devotingthe taxpayers&apos; money to compensation of a company which has made a fatprofit in the past) are minimised if our contribution consists of a relatively small sum devoted to &quot;bridging the gap&quot; in order to achieve a solution ofthis politically charged issue.    They would be further reduced if means couldbe found of avoiding any direct payment from the Exchequer to Chartered.11.       Moreover, there are solid grounds for arguing that the Charteredproblem is unique and that a contribution to a negotiated and agreed settle-meat in the special circumstances of this case could not be regarded asestablishing any precedent for liability in the case of expropriation of assetsby an overseas Government in other circumstances.    The Northern rhodesia government may be expected themselves to continue to emphasise theuniqueness of the issue, and have been at pains to deny any implication thatthey are set on a general policy of expropriation.    In the United Kingdom,there has been considerable press and financial opinion expressed againstthe contention that a serious precedent is involved for Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.12.      It is certain that the Northern Rhodesia Government could not contemplate paying more than half of any agreed sum, since to do so wouldmean abandoning their position of repudiating liability for the situation.   Ido not think we could contemplate paying more than half, if we are to avoid the appearance of accepting liability;   but I suggest we could go so far asthat without risk to our position.13.      I therefore recommend a settlement on the following lines for the urgent consideration of my colleagues:-(i)    The United Kingdom Government would agree in principle to share 50-50 with the Zambia Government in a final payment to Chartered, on the understanding that our contribution was&quot;ex-gratia&quot; and that the Northern Rhodesia Governmentwithdrew all claims against us and Chartered.(ii)    We would propose to the Zambia Government that we shouldjointly attempt to persuade Chartered to settle for  4 million.(iii)    Chartered&apos;s rights would be immediately transferred to theZambia Government, but payment to Chartered of the agreedfigure would be effected in Zambia by allowing Chartered tocontinue to draw royalties on the present basis until such time as they had received the agreed sum net of tax.   (Thisarrangement is devised to avoid income tax difficulties which EC RET
arise.    Chartered&apos;s offer is &quot;net of tax&quot;   which would be payable either in Northern Rhodesia or in the United kingdom on any sum recieved in respect of sale of their rights.   It istherefore necessary to find a method of payment which involvesneither amending United Kingdom tax law - which must be ruled out - nor the Northern Rhodesia Government in voting asum which has to be inflated to take account of the tax thatwould be levied).(iv)      The United Kingdom Governments half contribution to thecompensation payment would be made to the northern rhodesia Government within the framework of general financial aid for the territory.A.

annex the HISTORY OP THE PROBLEM OF THE CHARTERED company the British South Africa Company (&quot;Chartered&quot;) wasgiven a charter in 1889 to open up Central Africa.Chartered actually administer.edNorth.ern (and. Southern)Rhodesia until 1923.    Their agents obtained mineralconcessions from Lewanika, the Paramount Chief ofBarotseland and from other chiefs in the Eastern partof Northern Rhodesia.    The rights thus acquired byChartered were confirmed by the British Government.2.      For nearly fifty years doubts have been expressed about the validity and extent of Chartered&apos;s originalrights on the grounds that in some cases they appear tohave been obtained fraudulently and that in others thejurisdiction of the Chiefs concerned, did not extend overthe areas claimed.    In 1921, following local Europeanrepresentations,  a committee appointed by the colonial secretary under Lord Buxton recommended that the wholeof Chartered&apos;s claims to lend and minerals, insofar as theywere open to doubt,  should be referred to the privy council.    The British Government agreed and framed a precise list of questions for the Judicial Committee.3.     Following a change of government, however, insteadof reference to the Judicial Committee,  an omnibuscompromise settlement, known as the Devonshire Agreement,was reached in 1923.    The main points in it were that theBritish Government:(a)  terminated Chartered&apos;s administration ofSouthern Rhodesia and bought the Company out for  3*75 m.  in that territory;
SECRET(b) took over administration of Northern Rhodesiafrom Chartered which had incurred in the previous3h years losses there totalling  1.7m.;(c) recognised Chartered as &quot;the owner&quot; of mineral rights acquired under concessions or treaties with Chiefs in Northern Rhodesia.k.      In 1938 the Governor, Sir Hubert Young sent a despatch to the Colonial Secretary arguing that there were large areas (including about half of the Copperbelt) inwhich there was great doubt about the validity of theCompany&apos;s title;  that it had not been the BritishGovernment&apos;s intention, certainly before 1923,  torecognise Chartered in such wide areas;  and that Charteredhad deliberately misled the British Government about theextent of their concessions.    The Colonial Secretary(Mr. Malcolm MacDonald)  asked the Law Officers whetherthe British Government could either in law or (with especialregard to the Devonshire Agreement) in good faith, challengeChartered&apos;s rights in areas shown to be suspect.    The reply was negative especially in view of the 1923 Agreement.Mr. MacDonald conveyed this view to the Governor,    his despatch was published but carried little convictionlocally.5.      After 19h7 the controversy intensified because of thesteep rise in copper prices.    Sir Roy (then Mr.) Welenskyled the attack.    In 191+8 the Colonial Secretary (Mr. CreechJones)  asked Law Officers whether the British Governmentcould properly appoint a Commission to state the positiondefinitively.    The Law Officers&apos;   answer was again in the negative, both in law and in good faith &quot;in the light ofall that has gone before&quot;..    The Law Officers also said that,though the British Government could not themselves cast
doubt on Chartered&apos;s claims,  it might be in order for thelocal legislature to do so,    In that event the BritishGovernment must not participate prejudicially toChartered&apos;s interest.    No Commission was appointed.6.      Instead in 1950 an Agreement was concluded between,the British Government,  the Northern Rhodesia Governmentand Chartered.    Chartered gave up its ownership of therights in perpetuity;    instead, these pass to the northern rhodesia Government in 1986;    until then Northern rhodesia government receive 2.0% of the royalties.    The BritishGovernment are obliged in this Agreement to secure itsobservance until they cease to be responsible for northern rhodesia when they shall &quot;so far as it is possible to do so&quot;ensure that the successor government continues to abide by it.7.      Abortive negotiations took place in 19^3 betweenChartered and the Northern Rhodesian coalition government(in which UNIP only held 3 out of 10 portfolios) for thatGovernment to buyout Chartered.    A settlement might havebeen reached, on a figure in the region of  35 million;but negotiations broke down, mainly because of the inability of the British Government to    furnish a guarantee of thearrangements proposed.8.     At the Northern Rhodesia Independence Conference inMay 196^4,  the British delegation were obliged to accept thatthe Northern Rhodesian Government would not include in theindependence constitution a provision which would specificallysafeguard Chartered&apos;s rights under this Agreement.    It was,however,  agreed that the &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; in the selfgovernment constitution (which contains provision againstexpropriation of property without compensation) shouldreappear in the Independence Constitution.    The Northern
SECRETRhodesian Government have subsequently sought to persuade the British Government that Chartered&apos;s mineral rightsshould he excluded from this provision,9.     Although at the time of the Independence Conference,the Northern Rhodesia Government were contemplating furtherearly talks with Chartered, they later commissionedresearches by Maxwell Stamp Associates and sought the advice of leading British Counsel,    Early in September, theyformally requested the British Government to relieve theircountry of all obligations to Chartered, before IndependenceDay on October 21+th,  for the following main reasons:-(a) Chartered&apos;s right to mineral royalties derivedfrom concessions and treaties with Chiefs in the1890&apos; s many of which were invalid because they werefraudulently obtained or relate to areas of landnot within the Chief s jurisdiction or on. similargrounds.    In particular these treaties and.concessions did not include the present Copperbelt.(b) Despite long standing doubts on this score, and despite the acceptance by the British Governmentin 1922 of the recommendation of the BuxtonCommission that Chartered&apos;s claims should besubmitted to the Judicial Committee of the privy council the conclusion of the Devonshire agreement in 1923 amounted to a deliberate refusal on thepart of the British Government to test the validity of the claims.    By this action the BritishGovernment,  as protecting Power,  &quot;created anirresistible moral claim against itself&quot;.(c) It was,  therefore, dishonourable of the BritishGovernment to leave the Northern Rhodesian Governmentto incur the odium of amending the Constitution in- k -SECRET
SECRETorder to expropriate Chartered,    The BritishGovernment should themselves &quot;extinguish&quot;Chartered&apos;s claims &quot;before independence.    TheNorthern Rhode sian Government would make a&quot;goodwill    contribution&quot;hut the British government must pay the rest.10.    Discussions under the chairmanship of the LordChancellor (Lord Dilhorne) took place in September when theNorthern Rhodesian Minister of Finance (Mr. VYina) visitedLondon.    Mr. Wina advanced the arguments set out inparagraph 9.    He refused to join in any tripartite meeting with Chartered.    He offered  2 million as his Governments&apos;&quot;goodwill contribution&quot;.      The British Government took theview that they could not accept that they had legal ormoral responsibility for extinguishing the rights,  and thatin any case they could not create a precedent by accepting the burden of compensation for British assets seized by anoverseas government.    Without prejudice to the position of either Government, the British Government sought to ascertainChartered&apos;s lowest figure for a settlement.    Charteredinitially proposed  27 millions,  and then dropped to 18 million.    Both Mr. Wina and Chartered were told, without commitment,  that the British Government might be ready toconsider bridging a narrow gap,  if the other two partiescould get close together.    No progress however could bemade and the tolks ended.    On the same day Dr. Kaundapresented to Parliament in Lusaka a Bill for the holding ofa referendum,  so that the necessary constitutional changescould be made after independence in order to withdraw fromChartered the protection of the Bill of Rights.11.    Chartered informed Dr. Kaunda on 7th October that they
SECRETwould accept  8 millions sterling net of tax,    The Northern Rhodesian Government told us on 10th October that they considered that the responsibility lies with us,  and thatthey are willing to assist in a settlement by making a contribution of  2 million.    They add however that, withoutprejudice to their position,  there now seems to be prospectof a settlement through &quot;combined action&quot; by the BritishNorthern Rhodesia Governments:    and they therefore hope thatthe British Government will be ready to proceed on thelatest proposal by Chartered,      No decision on what should now be done was reached by the previous Government   beforethe general election.
