HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT)C.(64) 16 COPY NO.     i) ^23rd november 1964CABINETPOSSIBILITY OF ADVANCING DATE OF PAYMENTOF NATIONAL INSURANCE pensions memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceIntroductionFor the reasons of which my colleagues are aware it is not possibleto advance the date (29th March) from which the order books in the possession of pensioners can be amended so as to incorporate in them the new rates of pension.    Equally it is not possible for Post Offices todeduce from the amounts on existing orders the exact cum due at the new rates.Double payments by the Post Office on existing order foils2.       The only feasible method of making payments before 29th March isfor the Post Offices to make payment of a multiple of the amount printedon the order foils, the total of the extra sum payable being, howeverroughly, related to the amount that the pensioner would have been paid had it been practicable to give earlier effect to the provisions of the legislation.Glasses of pensioners who should be covered3.      If such advance payments v/ere to be given to National insurance retirement pensioners, there would certainly be strong pressure fromwidows of all cla.sses and from war and industrial disablement pensionerswho were also having to wait until the end of March for their increases.But we must recognise that the overwhelming majority of disablementpensioners are either in ordinary employment (as are many widows) or are receiving retirement pensions, and that those who retired but havenot retirement pensions (because their pensioned disablement hasprevented them from qualifying) are receiving the UnempioyabilitySupplement, which is being increased in any event from 25th January,in addition to their disablement pension.    Together with retirement pensioners these groups number some l\ million.Amount and cost of the advance payment4,      Payment of double the amount on the face of all pension orders inone week would cost from  20-  25 million according to the categoriesincluded (see Appendix A).    Payment of double the amount three timescould be said, very roughly, to compensate for &quot;loss&quot; of pensionincreases back to 7th December.    But some 1.3 million of the old who-1-SECilET
are in. receipt of National Assistance will already have had an erfra  4from the Board.    A two-fold increase would compensate for pension&quot;lost&quot; back to 11th January.5.       Payment of the double amount twice, instead of three times, onthe basis that the most needy of the pensioners had already had the extraAssistance payment, would of course reduce the cost to  40-  50 million as compared with  60- 75 million if there were three payments.    Itwould also protect us from pressure to give similar treatment to the sick and unemployed whose benefits are being increased from the week beginning 25th January.    This would not in any event be practicable,since many of them on benefit in December/January will have receivedit for only a few days and would no longer be on benefit when the doublepayments were made.Practical implications of advance payments by the Post Offices6.       An outline of the scheme proposed by the Post Office to meet the requirement stated above is given in Appendix B,7.       The amount to be multiplied in the specified week or weeks would depend on other factors besides the pensioners basic pension rate.    Itwould not be feasible for post offices to work on anything other than thetotal amount payable in each case for the week concerned, as shown onthe order for that week.      This amount would often include elementswhich are not being inci&quot;eased, e.g. increments for postponed retire-ment or graduated pension.    If widows were included the v/ar widow&apos;sand industrial injuries widow&apos;3 pension payable to under 40 childlesswidows and to separated widows is not being increased at all - and it isimpossible to identify them for this operation.    Many pensioners would therefore receive considerably more than they would have &quot;lost&quot;.    Onthe other hand, a substantial number of pensioners have their pensionsreduced or extinguished on account of earnings, the reduction in any weekbeing calculated according to the earnings in the previous week.    Ineffect, they would be penalised twice for a single week&apos;c earnings.   Many,not realising how arbitrarily the scheme would have to work, wouldcomplain bitterly about their treatment.8.      Some sizeable groups of pensioners are not paid by order book,or would not be so paid at the material time.    They would include inparticular -(a) Borne people in hospitals or other public institutions.(b) People whose new order book had been delayed or lost, or whose order for the particular week had had to be replaced by a postal draft (e.g. because of multiple adjustment ofthe amount, changes of circumstances and provisionalentitlement - over 12, 000 cases a week).(c) People paid quarterly, (over 100, 000).It has not been possible in the time available to decide what arrange-rnents could be made for making similar payments to the pensioners inthe above groups but clearly such payments would have to be madeconsiderably in arrear and it is not possible to be sure that everyonein category (b) could be identified.
9.       If disablement pensioners were included, a particularly awkwardproblem would be that of Industrial Injuries cases involving the &quot;CollieryWorkers1 Supplement&quot;, the cost of which is met from funds maintained by the National Coal Board.    In about 21, 000 cases the supplement is included in the amount of the Industrial Injuries pension orders (and so would be included in the advance calculation);  in about 7, 000 it is paidby a special order book;  in the remaining 48, 000 it is paid direct by theNational Coal Board.    Probably in the second, and certainly in the last,of these categories, it would have to be excluded from the calculation ofthe advance payment.    The anomaly in comparison with the first categorywould seem indefensible.    A similar position would arise on the warpensions side, where some 15, 000 order books include both war die able-ment pensions and ordinary service pensions (not covered by the up-rating10.      These are but some examples of difficult points which will arise.To a large extent difficulties of this sort are inevitable in a scheme withsuch a rough and ready basis of entitlement.    This strongly suggests that legislation providing for the payments (see paragraph 17) would not beable to set out all the conditions for entitlement and the other matters arising (for instance, the status of overpayments, and the circumstances in which they can be recovered).    It seems inevitable that legislation would have to give the Minister wide discretion in matters of this sortand it follows from this that claims and questions arising under thescheme would be quite unsuitable for detexTnination by the national insurance Statutory Authorities, but would have to be on a discretionaryba sx s.11.      From the Post Off ice&apos;s point of view the main practical - butcertainly not insuperable - problems for the 25,000 or so post officesinvolved - of which some 23, 000 are run by sub-postmasters, usuallyv/ith other kinds of business - may be summarised as -(a) a general slowing down of service while the extra payments are being made, with come queueing and congestion at thebusier post office counters;the indentification of pension orders which are presented inweeks subsequent to that in which the payment is due, aswell as the need to distinguish between books on which thereis an entitlement to the payment and those on which there isnot.12.      It should be emphasised that neither post offices nor the local offices of the Ministry would be in a position to deal with the inevitablyvery large number of complaints of unfairness or error.    It is not easy to see how these could be satisfactorily dealt with.    Certainly there could be no pretence that payments were necessarily fair as between onepensioner and another, and there would be no effective answer to the resulting multitude of complaints.(which would be swelled by the non-contributory pensioners and other groups who are paid by order bookbut would not be entitled to the advance).    Many people would no doubtwish to lodge a formal appeal against the treatment of their case but would have to be denied.
13.      If the proposed insurance increases did not come into effect until29th March but arrangements were made for advance payments, it wouldbe necessary to consider what action should be taken by the national assistance Board.14.      If the Board followed its normal practice it would take intoaccount, for the week or weeks in question, any advance.nce payment receivedby the recipient of assistance.    But the effect of this would be to deprive the recipient of his assistance or to reduce it substantially in the week inquestion;  and of course it would nullify the effect of the additional payments for pensioners on national assistance.15.      This difficulty could be overcome by statutory authority being given to enable the Board to disregard for assistance purposes anynational insurance or war pension advance payments: but this would benefit only national assistance recipients who were supplementedpensioners.    There are about half a million recipients on national assist-ance who are not in receipt of national insurance benefits:  and the board would feel it to be quite wrong to deny to them advance payments whichwere being made to retirement or war pensioners, for the most partbetter off, and having no need of assistance, especially at a time whenincreases in the assistance scale rates were due to take place in an-/event because of increases in the cost of living.16.      In these circumstances it would seem to the Board that the right course would clearly be to advance the formal date for the coming intooperation of the improved assistance scales to the data when it isproposed that the increases in short-term insurance benefits should comeinto effect, that is 25th January.    This could be done, in conjunction withadvance payments of national insurance, without the necessity to increasenational assistance allowances and then reduce them again shortly afterwards when the normal insurance increases take place on 29th March,What the Board would do would be to treat any advance insurance paymentas though they were weekly additional insurance payments of 12s. 6d. or21s., so that the actual assistance in payment would be unaffected.    Theactual assistance allowances of most of the short-term beneficiarieswould, of course, be unaffected, and the uncupplemented recipients ofassistance would receive their (actual) increase at the same time.    for practical purposes, all recipients of assistance would receive anincrease at the came time in their income (some from national insurance payments and some from national assistance payments).   Thisis obviously very desirable in the context of national assistance, wherethe over-riding objective is to meeting the needs of national assistancerecipients in a way equitable to all.Financial and legislative provision17,      The two possible ways of financing any such advance payments are (a) to meet the whole cost from the Exchequer, and (b) to make the advance payments of insurance benefits, which are the bulk cf the cost,out of the Insurance Funds,    However the payments were financed, their nature and scale would be such that, since there is time, Parliament-4-
would expect them to be authorised by specific legislation in advance,and not merely through a Supplementary Estimate and the AppropriationAct.    Some legislative provision might also be needed in order to makea consequential provision about national assistance.    If the advancepayments of insurance benefit were to be made out of the Funds, it islikely that the essential legislative provision could be made by amend-ment of the National Insurance Bill in the House.    Payments to war pensioners could be authorised by Royal Warrant,    To authorise pay-ments out of the Exchequer to national insurance pensioners wouldrequire a separate Bill;  and a very large Supplementary Estimate wouldbe needed which might make it necessary to reconsider the programme for the Consolidated Fund Bill,    On bala.nce, it would seem easier tomeet the cost from the Insurance Funds.    Some part of it could thenbe met by bringing forward the date for raising contributions;  the earliestpossible date for this would be 8th March and this would produce 15 million in revenue from insured persons and employers with 4 million extra from the Exchequer,18.      To pay the higher short-term benefits from the end of Januaryinstead of from 29th March would cost the National Insurance Fund an extra.  9 million;  and to provide double payments of national insurance retirement pensions and widow&apos;s benefits would cost 22 million on each occasion.    It follows that provision of doublepayments on two occasions would bring the total extra cost to  53 million.Towards meeting this extra expenditure, some  19 million (including 4 million from the Exchequer) could be secured by advancing the pay-ment of the new contributions to 8th March.    However, I have put further enquiries in hand to see if this date can be advanced.    If 8th March standsthe extra expenditure would exceed the extra, income by  34 million,which would mean running a significant deficit on the working of the Fundthis year.    If double payments were provided on three occasions, the excess of extra expenditure over extra income would be  56 million.And although the Government Actuary&apos;s Report on the Bill shows that theFund should have small surpluoen on average up to 1970, it also showslarge deficits during the following ten years.    The post office and other administrative costs of paying double on pension orders might be of theorder of  150,000 on each occa.sion.    As to the extra National Assistancecosts, these would amount to some  4 million on the proposals inparagraph 21,Conclusion19. The conclusion must be that a scheme of the sort described ispossible only if it is accepted -(a) that its administration would necessarily appear to be (and indeed be) somewhat chaotic, inequitable and ha.phasard,with some inconvenience to Post Office customers at large;(b) that it would give rise to much complaint in response towhich the inequities and haphazard effects would have to beadmitted and justified solely on the grounds that they wereadministratively unavoidable;-5-SECfSET
(c) that normal accounting standards were relaxed and that therewould he an increased risk of erroneous payments and fraud;(d) that (if the cost was to fall on the Fund) there is risk of delay in the passage of the National Insurance Bill (delay in royal assent until after Christmas would delay early payment of sickness and unemployment benefit).M.

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE POST OFFICEThis paper presents a possible scheme under which the PostOffice could undertake the work of making advance payments to pensioners.2.       For the purpose of this exercise it is assumed -(i)  that each payment would be made by doubling the pensionlu^ in cai cr ncro weeks befcrs 9th March;(ii) that the number of order books on which additional payments would have to be made would be of theorder of 7 million;(iii)  that an announcement of the payment would be made assoon as possible.3.       The Post Office has examined various ways in which the paymentsmight be made.    The only one which is thought to be practicable and toprovide reasonable safeguards against fraud is -(i)  an adhesive label in the form of a receipt for the totalpension would be attached to the appropriate pensionorder by the Post Office counter clerk at the time of payment;(ii) the counter clerk would calculate the sum due (viz. twice the sum as shown on the order), enter it on the gummedlabel and on the counterfoil, date- stamp the label andthe counterfoil, obtain the pensioners signature on thelabel, and pay over the cash;(iii) the Post Office would claim the enhanced amountsdisbursed through normal accounting machinery.(if absolutely necessary the Post Office could at additional expense and inconvenience, and with some possibility o  error, segregate thoseorders bearing up-rating labels before returning them to the issuingauthorities.)4.      This scheme could only be operated by the Post Office underthe following conditions -(i)  Supplies of the adhesive label would have to be madeavailable to the Post Office three weeks before thedate on which the first pension payment fell due.At least 25 million adhesive labels would berequired of which roughly 10-12 million wouldbe needed in time for the first payment.
$ii)  The Poet Office could not undertake to deal with disputesabout the entitlement of pensioners to the advancepayments, or to answer enquiries (e,g, about theamount paid) other than those of a purely routinecharacter which could be dealt with across the counter.The Post Office could undertake no financial responsibility whatever for losses   incurred orfrauds perpetrated in connection with the scheme.(iv) Adequate publicity would be given to the scheme,including the matter of eligibility, and leaflets(some 15 million) made available for handing out to pensioners in post offices.(v) At the appropriate time the Post Office would be put infunds to meet the extra payments.(vi)  The Post Office would be reimbursed in full for alladditional costs incurred in operating the scheme.(It is estimated that some 15 million of the 21 millionadvance payments would fall to be paid by Sub-Postmasters.    It is highly probable that an extrapayment would be demanded for this work and this/ould have to be negotiated with the Federation of sub-Postmasters.5,       The operation of a scheme on the foregoing lines would be feasible although it would not unnaturally present a number of problemof which the following spring to mind -(a) A slowing down in the speed of service for the ordinarycustomer while the extra earlier payments are beingmade, with some queueing and congestion at the busierpost office counters.(b) Difficulty in indentifying those pension orders due foradvance payments which are presented in weekssubsequent to the one in which the payment is due, aswell as that of distinguishing between books on whichthere is an advance entitlement and those on whichthere is not.(c) An increased error rate.(d) Greater opportunity for fraud by counter staff and moreparticularly by people acting as agents for pensioners.(iii)SSCRST
