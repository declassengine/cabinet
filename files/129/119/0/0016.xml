S DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)The Committee on Future Legislation have consideredproposals made by Ministers for Bills to be included in the present3ession&apos;s programme and have heard the views of the ministers concerned.   For ease of reference I set out at Annex I the bills which have already been introduced or which are to be introducedvery shortly.2.      We face a difficult situation.    Bills to which we are committed in The Queen&apos;s Speech and otherwise, together withthose Bills which are or may become essential for other reasons and a few more of exceptional urgency or importance, already addup to a substantially bigger programme than could be carried throughin a normal Session.    The situation is made the more difficult bythe prospect of a particularly heavy Finance Bill in the spring to implement measures which the Chancellor of the Exchequer hasalready announced.3.      It follows that at this stage we cannot commit ourselves toany more Bills in the present Session unleGS we are willing to dropsome of those to v/hich we are committed already.4.       There is a further difficulty.    In the normal course the mainbulk of the programme should be introduced by January.    Wecannot achieve this, but we must get as near it as we can.    I mustwarn my colleagues that if any substantial number of Bills isdelayed until after Easter the casualty list will be heavy.    Inparticular, the prospects of the Iron and Steel Bill must be severely prejudiced if it cannot have its Second Reading in theHouse of Commons before Easter.5,      In the light of these considerations the Future legislation committee have prepared the classification of Bills set out in annex II under the f following heads -Al - Essential Bills - Bills which must be taken ifservices are to be maintained or obligationsfulfilled.A2 - Contingent Bills - Bills which may become essentialduring the Session (it is to be assumed that not allthese Bills will in fact be needed).C.(64) 1617th November, 1964CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1964-65Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council-1-SECIRET1
Bl - Main Programme -   Bills to which the Government ar*committed, together with a very few other Bills of exceptional urgency and importance.B2 - Bills to be included in the Main Programme if and when time permits.C   - Reserve Bills - Bills on which work may proceedprovided that it is not at the expense of work onBills in Lists Bl and.B2.   There is little prospect that any Bills from this list can be taken this session.D   - Other Bills - bill  for which there will not be time or which would become necessary on a contingencythat now seerns remote.6.      The Committee on Future Legislation will begin in january to prepare a programme for the 1965-66 Session and will then beable to consider what provision they can recommend in that Sessionfor Bills in Lists C and D, together with any casualties fromLists Bl and B2 and other Bills which Ministers may then wish toput forward.7.      Meanwhile I ask the Cabinet to approve the programme forthis Session set out in Annex II and to authorise the Committee on future Legislation to keep the programme under review as the session proceeds, and to select for introduction Bills from List 32and the Re serve List if time becomes available.H.3.Whitehall, S.
