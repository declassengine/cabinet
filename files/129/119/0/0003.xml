We have at this stage consideredprimarily what commitments to legislation we should undertake in the speech.2.        There is a number of Bills which will be essential;   they includemeasures on the machinery of Government and on the number of ministers in the House of Commons.   These essential Bills will not make greatdemands on Parliamentary time and it is not imperative to mention any ofthem in the Speech.3.    We cannot of course set out in the first Session of Parliament tocarry all or even a greater part of the legislation required to implementall the policies on which we fought the election.   We are agreed that inthe first Session we should have legislation on rent control, land,iron and steel and leasehold enfranchisement.   The draft Speech annexedrefers to Bills on these subjects and also to Bills on racial discrimination,capital punishments Law Commissioners and the parliamentary commissioner for the investigation of grievances.   We seek at this stageour colleagues&apos; agreement to these references in the Speech.   It will be useful to us to have the Cabinet&apos;s views on the remainder of the speech and on other Bills which should be introduced in the first Session and whichwould not cost money.4.        The Chancellor of the Exchequer is considering with the ministers concerned the order of priorities we should establish among Bills whichwould cost money.   These include, for example, the abolition of national health Service charges, pension increases and other changes in theNational Insurance system, and the Guaranteed Minimum Income.   At thisstage such measures are covered by sections in the draft Speech which are shown in square brackets,,   In the light of those discussions and of theCabinet&apos;s views we will prepare a further draft Speech for consideration bythe Cabinet.C,(64) 320th October, 1964
