C.(64) 21 COPY NO.27th November, 1964CABINETGENERAL GRANTS TO LOCAL authorities memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentI have been consulting the local authority associations (as required by the Local Government Act, 1958) on the amount of theassistance to be given to local authorities from the Exchequer throughthe general grant during the next grant period.    The new period startsnext April; if the authorities are to be told what grants they will begetting in time for their rate making, a final decision is needed urgentlyto permit the necessary Order to be made and approved by the House ofCommons before Christmas.2.       The grant period rune for a minimum of two years.    estimates of the likely expenditure during each year on the services concerned(chiefly education, local health, fire service, old people&apos;s homes, and care of children) were worked out in the summer by the localauthorities.    Departments, acting in agreement with the Treasury,have reduced them to what seem realistic figures in the light of currentpolicies, i.e. those of the previous Government.3.      For the first year, granted our inheritance of a financial crisisand indeed of this system of grant, the reduced figures are probablyreasonable enough.    In agreement with the other Ministers concerned,I am content to stick by them and to defend the  17 million cut whichis proposed on estimates of  1,263 million, despite some hard feelingson welfare homes for the aged and on the cost of London reorganisation.4.       The second year, however, running from April, 1966 to march, 1967 is another matter.    It will start eighteen months after this year&apos;s election, and it will be our policies that will be cominginto effect by then.    But under this grant system the grant cannot be altered during its two year period to allow for changes in the pattern of spending: all increases of this kind (prices and wages can becatered for) will fall on the rates.5.      With domestic rate bills rising by 5 per cent per annum, andwith our two manifesto commitments about the burden of rates andthe transfer of more of teacher&apos;s salaries to the Exchequer, this isa situation I am sure my colleagues will not wish to contemplate.Our present excuses, which are good ones, will be running out justwhen the impact of our policies really begins to be felt.    The effect will go exactly contrary to our commitments.-1-
6.       The only thing we can do immediately is to make no cut in thetotal estimates produced by the local authorities for the second year(without necessarily accepting their estimates for individual services),This would in effect be giving them a margin of  20 million to allow for development of services.    It would increase the grant for 1966/67by  11 or  12 million.7.       We should still be failing until more than two years after theElection, to make any appreciable contribution towards redeeming ourpledges (except to the extent, if any, that the services did not developfast enough to absorb the whole of the  20 million).    We cannotlegislate for reduction of the burden of rates or for changing theeducation grant arrangements until next session, and that cannotaffect the rates until 1967/68.    The only thing we could do, short-term, to reduce the burden on rates in 1966/67 would be to take powerto change the grant system to an annual basis and calculate the grant for 1966/67 afresh next year.    This would mean a short Bill beforethe end of next year, and I would want to consider the possibilities ofthis with my local government colleagues and the Chancellor of theExchequer,8.      But immediately we must make the order;  and I suggest thatin view of the facts outlined above we must do it on the most generousbasis open to us for the second year.R. C.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S. W. 1.27th November, 1964-2-
