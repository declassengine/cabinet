CO207C. (64) 27 COPY NO.11th December, 1964CABINETESTABLISHMENT OF LAW COMMISSIONS FOR ENGLANDAND WALES AND FOR scotland memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the purpose of this paper is to submit to the cabinet proposals for implementing the undertaking given in The Queen&apos;sSpeech to appoint Law Commissioners &quot;to advance reform of the law&quot;.2.      The Home Affairs Committee have considered proposals forthe establishment by statute of a Law Commission for England andWales which would be composed of five lawyers of high standingappointed, with a supporting staff, by the Lord Chancellor.    TheCommission would have the task of planning a systematic review ofthe English law; carrying out consolidation and statute law revision;putting forward proposals for the reform of particular areas of thelaw; and providing Departments with a research and advisory service, particularly on Commonwealth and foreign law.    A similarbody would be appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theLord Advocate jointly to review Scottish law.3.      The Home Affairs Committee consider that bodies with theproposed functions would provide a valuable means of securing the systematic reform of the law.    They think it necessary to ensure,however, that account is taken of the responsibility of departmental ministers for the law&apos;within the field for which they are answerable to Parliament, and that the Commissions operate under the iltimate authority of the Cabinet.    For this purpose they propose that the commissions should function on the lines indicated in the Annex.They believe that these arrangements will leave with the Commissionsthe initiative in proposing areas of the law for investigation and willnot impede the achievement of their long-term objectives, but will ensure -(a) that the Minister with departmental responsibility isconsulted on a particular project, on its timing, and on whether it should be carried out by the Commissionthemselves or by another body, such as the HomeSecretaryls Criminal Law Revision Committee, or a departmental Committee appointed ad hoc; and(b) that in the event of disagreement the issue is submittedto the Cabinet.-I-
4.       The Committee consider arrangements of this kind necessaryin relation to England and Wales (the situation in Scotland is simpler)because the whole field of the law which it is agreed that theCommission should review includes not only, at one end of thespectrum, a considerable quantity of pure &quot;lawyer&apos;s law&quot;, whichwould be unlikely to raise issues of policy, and, at the other, law which is the immediate reflection of Government policy, with whichthe Commission are unlikely to concern themselvess but also a wide area between these extremes in which issues of law and of policy are closely related.    The law on trade unions, hire purchase, and muchof the criminal law afford examples.    It may be desirable for a topicwhich raises issues of policy to be examined by a body which includesnot only lawyers but also lay members of the public and persons with first-hand experience of the field in question.    And there may beissues which it is undesirable to have examined publicly at a particularmoment because of their relationship to the development of other aspects of Government policy.5,      The Committee consider, however, that disagreement on either the timing or the method of investigation would be rare.    No doubt theCommission in preparing their programme   would consult Ministersinformally and take account both of a Minister&apos;s desire to see aparticular topic examined and of other relevant considerations towhich their attention might be drawn, while Ministers, individually and collectively, would seek to avoid disagreement with a body of theCommission^ weight and prestige.    Acceptance of the Commission^programme of work would not preclude Ministers themselves fromputting in hand investigations on matters of current concern, nor would they be under an obligation to consult the Commission on Billsincluded in the Governments programme of legislation, though if theCommission v/ere known to be working on a subject within the ambitof a particular Bill it would no doubt be thought prudent to consult them ad hoc.6.       The Committee did not attempt to consider the possibility of reform in the procedure of the House of Commons, which would makethe passage of Law Reform Bills easier than it is at present, or meansof recruiting and training a larger number of skilled draftsmen.Both are important to the effective operation of the Commission,but are being considered separately.Summary7.       The Cabinet are asked:(i) to approve in principle the establishment of a statutoryLaw Commission for England and Wales with thefunctions indicated in paragraph 1 above, and of asimilar Commission to be appointed by the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Lord Advocate jointly with similar functions in relation to Scotlandj(ii) to agree that the Commissions should operate on thelines indicated in the Annex.It is hoped to introduce the necessary legislation as soon as parliament resumes after the Christmas Recess.15, H.Whitehall, S. W. 1.11th December, 1964
OPERATION OF THE LAW COMMISSIONSTHE LAW COMMISSION FOR ENGLAND AND WALES(i)  The Law Commission should operate under the authority of theLord Chancellor.    It should keep the whole law under review.It should submit to the Lord Chancellor periodically a programme covering a convenient period - say of five or tenyears - for the detailed examination of particular aspects ofthe law or of the law within particular fields, and should recommend how the topics included in the programme shouldbe examined - e. gc :(a) by the Commission itself;(b) by the Home Secretary1 s Criminal law revision Committee;(c) by a body appointed ad hoc; or(d) by the relevant Department in consultation withoutside experts.(ii)  The Lord Chancellor before approving the proposed programme would consult the Ministers Departmentally concerned.This might result in some adjustment of the timetable - e. g, toavoid taking the examination of a contentious topic at a time which might prejudice the development of the government&apos;s policy in the field in question and perhaps in agreement that aparticular topic would more appropriately be handled by a means other than that proposed.    Failing agreement the issue would be referred to the Cabinet.(iii) The programme of work, when approved, would be published;and thereafter, subject to any change in circumstances, the projects for v/hich it called would be put in hand by theCommission or the relevant Minister according to the methodthat had been agreed.    Within an approved plan, the commission would be responsible for -(a) putting in hand a comprehensive programme ofconsolidation and statute law revision;  and(b) undertaking the specific projects of law reform(including, where appropriate, the drafting ofa Bill) which it had been agreed that they should undertake both within the field for which theLord Chancellor was responsible and outsidethis field.(iv) The resultant specific proposals by Departmental committees for the reform of the law would be made to the Minister con-cerned .and considered by him in the ordinary way.Recommendations made by the Commission would beconsidered by the Lord Chancellor if they fell within his own-3-
field and if not he would transmit the CommissionsReports to the relevant Departmental Minister.    TheCommission^ Reports would be published, like those of departmental Committees.    It would be made clear thatthey emanated from the Commission and the LordChancellor would not be committed to them, so that if therecommendations were not accepted there would be noapparent breach of the principle of collective responsibility.(v) Recommendations, whether by the Commission or byDepartmental  Committees, would be referred to theCabinet in the event of disagreement among the ministers concerned on their implementation,(vi)  The Commission would provide a research and advisory service on Commonwealth and foreign law and would beavailable for consultation by Departments in connectionwith their own examination of particular fields of the law,though there would be no obligation to consult the Commissionon Bills within the Governments programme of legislation.(vii)  The Commission would make to the Lord Chancellor anannual report on their work which would be presented toParliament.THE LAW COMMISSION FOR SCOTLAND(viii)  The proposed Law Commission for Scotland would beappointed by the Secretary of State and the Lord Advocatejointly, and functions corresponding to those of the LordChancellor in relation to the Law Commission for Englandand Wales would be performed by these two Ministersacting together.    The Commission, while at liberty to makeprivately to those Ministers suggestions as to the areas oflaw which in their opinion need detailed examination, wouldnot themselves embark on an examination in depth of anysuggested area unless those Ministers -(i) agreed with the suggestion, and(ii) did not consider that the subject matter called for examination by some other body.(ix)  So far as law in the area of any Great Britain department was concerned, the Scottish Ministers v/ould consult withthe relevant English Minister.(x)  The Scottish Commission^ substantive proposals for reforminglegislation would be made to the Secretary of State and theLord Advocate and the proposals (or a summary of them)would be published.(xi) Arrangements accepted on both sides wotild be necessary fora two-way traffic in ideas and in information (e. g. aboutforeign law) between the Scottish Commission and theCommission for England and Wales.    And joint discussion would be necessary in relation to areas of law which areparallel in the two systems.-4-
