llS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;S GOVERNMENT)C-(64) 11 COPY NO.      ^ 93rd November,  1964CABINETCOMMONWEALTH IMMIGRATION:   CONSULTATIONWITH OTHER GOVERNMENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations we are committed (a) to reviewing, in consultation  with other commonwealth Governments, the method of controlling commonwealth immigration to this country, but (b) to continuing the existingcontrol in force meanwhile.2.       Other Commonwealth Governments appear, in general, tohave accepted the necessity for control, and they have made nosuggestions for any radical change in the method of control.    Thenumber of immigrants from Commonwealth countries, other than theold Dominions, since 1955 now amounts to a figure of the order of600,000, to which must be added a substantial natural increase.   Thepresence of so many immigrants, particularly in some of the large cities in which they congregate, has undoubtedly aroused some publicresentment and has caused social difficulties and added materially tothe strain on housing and other services.    A very strict degree ofcontrol is therefore in everyone&apos;s  interest, to give time for theprocess of absorbing these new communities to proceed without the pressure of further immigration on a large scale.     The fact thatthere are 330, 000 applicants on the waiting list for non-prioritylabour vouchers gives some indication ox the potential inflow ifcontrol were relaxed, with the consequent risk of far greater socialstrains and even of breakdown of the services affected.3.      Part I of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, underwhich the present control is exercised, will lapse at the end ofthis year unless renewed, and it is therefore imperative that itshould be continued in force by the annual Expiring Laws continuance bill.    This will be published in a few days&apos; time and will come upfor debate this month.4.       We think it important that we should be in a position in debateto say that we have taken the first steps towards giving other commonwealth Governments the opportunity to discuss immigration control with us.    This means that we should send them a suitablecommunication as soon as possible.    In view of the difficulties ofthe situation we should avoid committing ourselves to making any proposals for changing the system of control, and it is desirable-1-
that we should retain the initiative in any Commonwealthdiscussions.    We suggest therefore that the communication shouldbe confined to announcing cur readiness to discuss the subject, if other Governments think it would be useful to do so.5.       A draft message to Commonwealth Governments on theselines is attached for the consideration of our colleagues,F. SoA.B.3rd November,  1964-2-
DRAFT COMMUNICATION TO COMMONWEALTHGOVERNMENTSThe British Government are reviewing the operation of thepresent controls on immigration from the Commonwealth.    It isclearly important that the flow of immigrants into this densely populated country should not exceed the rate at which they can be absorbed into the life of the community and properly accomodated in the large cities where work is available; limitation, is in theinterests of the people of this country, of the immigrants alreadysettled here, and of the new immigrants themselves.It is evident that many more people from the Commonwealthwish to come to Britain than can possibly be absorbed.    For instance,there are some 330, 000 applicants at present on the v/waiting list forCategory C vouchers, and this number would be even larger but forthe &quot;standstill&quot; which was placed in June on new non-priorityapplications from India and Pakistan.    And large numbers of immigrants are accompanied, or followed later, by dependants.As Commonwealth Governments are aware, control is atpresent exercised under Part I of the Commonwealth ImmigrantsAct which will, unless renewed, expire at the end of this year.    TheBritish Government have decided to propose its renewal for afurther year by including it in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill,which has just been introduced.    The British Government will however be very ready to discuss with commonwealth governments the form of the existing control as soon as their ownreview of the position has been carried out and would be glad toknow whether the Government of................ think that discussions between them and the British Government could be usefully instituted for this purpose.-3-
