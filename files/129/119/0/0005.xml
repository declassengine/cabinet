SECKSThlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)C(64) 5 COPY NO. 5 j21st October, 1964-CABINETIRON AND STEEL NATIONALISATIONMemorandum by the Minister of power should like to give my colleagues an outline of the proposals which Ihave in mind for handling iron and steel nationalisation.1.        Scope of NationalisationI think we should concentrate on the 13 large undertakings (includingRichard Thomas and Baldwins, already in public ownership) which compriseover 90 per cent of the pig iron and crude steel capacity in the country.Included in the 13 undertakings are three concerns which are subsidiaries of major engineering groups - English Steel Corporation (a subsidiary of theVickers group);   G.K.N. Steel Company Limited (a subsidiary of the G.K, N.group);   and the Iron and Steel Division of Tube Investments Limited.    these three cases will pose some complex problems of definition and drafting if weare to avoid a hybrid Bill which would involve special Parliamentary procedure,and this may require further examination;   but I am assuming for the moment that we should include the steel-making parts of these groups in ournationalisation proposals.2.       Method of NationalisationI think we should proceed by transferring the shares of the companies to be nationalised to a new Central Authority, as was -done in the Iron and steel nationalisation Act 1949, but, in order to make a clean break with the past andto ensure that the structure of the industry is reorganised as quickly aspossible, we should provide in the Bill that the Central Authority is to draw up schemes for reorganising the industry which, if approved by the Minister,would be put into effect by Statutory Instrument.   This will enable the CentralAuthority to base its proposals for reorganisation on the knowledge of theindustry which it has acquired by taking over and running the Companies, and,once the reorganisation has been carried out, it will be no less irreversiblethan if it had been laid down in the Bill itself.3.        CompensationIf we follow the precedents of previous nationalisation Acts, thecompensation would be based on the Stock Exchange value of the shares at somespecified date or dates.    This may be open to criticism in the case of the steelindustry on the ground that the Stock Exchange values, influenced as they are by expectations of dividend distributions and political uncertainties,  greatlyunder-rate the true values of the Companies, whether in terms of values of assets or in terms of capitalised earnings.    There is no need to take a finaldecision about this at the present stage:   I suggest that the matter should be remitted to officials for examination.SEC SET
4.       Iron and Steel FederationIt will be essential to secure control of the trading subsidiaries of theBritish Iron and Steel Federation (B.I.S. C , O.R.E. , etc.) which handlecentrally the imports and shipping of iron ore, and, as such, occupy a keyposition in the industry.   The company structure of these subsidiaries is extremely complex.   It v/ill need careful examination to ensure that the property and rights of the nationalised Companies in them are properly protected.   some special provision in the Bill to safeguard this may well be necessary.We shall also have to consider whether any special provision should bemade to safeguard the position of the new Central Authority and the publicly-owned Companies in relation to the Federr.t\r..-.. generally.   For this we shallhave to obtain detailed information about the way in which the Federation, andthe conferences which compose it, work.5.       Iron OreThe Companies to be nationalised accomit for about 95 per cent of current United Kingdom production of iron ore, and contrql about 60 per cent of workable reserves.   In the short term, therefore, there will be no problemabout iron ore, and 1 do not propose to complicate the nationalisation Bill by including in it provision for nationalising ore in the ground.   I think this shouldbe left for later consideration as part of the question of the nationalisation of mineral rights generally.6.       Procedure and TimetableEven, a simplified,   streamlined measure such as I am proposing willthrow up some complex problems in. the preparation and drafting of the Bill -some of them requiring factual investigations, for which consultation with the organisations in the industry will be necessary.   It will not be easy to. steera course which will keep us clear of the hybrid procedure in Parliament,    we ought, in any case, to take time for consultation with the industry itself andwith other interested organisations before committing ourselves in detail to anationalisation scheme.   It is very doubtful whether we could have a properlyprepared Bill ready for introduction in Parliament before at least half-way through the Session, which seems rather late for a Bill of this magnitude.I think v/e shall make a much better job of it, both politically and inevery other way, if we make a firm statement of our intentions as soon aspossible, but prepare for the introduction of the Bill itself at the beginning ofthe second Session of Parliament, rather than try to rush it through in thesecond half of the first Session.   My proposals, therefore, for the plan of campaign and the timetable are as follows:-(a)      We should set up an interdepartmental committee with instructions to report to Ministers not later than theend of November on the main features of the nationalisation scheme,
;ecret(b) We should include in The Queen&apos;s Speech some suchwords as the following; -&quot;My Ministers will initiate early action to re-establish the necessary public ownership and control of theiron and steel industry&quot;.(c) We should amplify this in the Debate on the Address, giving a firm statement of our intention to take into public ownershipthe main part of the iron and steel industry, and promisingto present to Parliament early in the New Year a White paper setting out the general lines of our proposals.(d) We should issue the White Paper as soon as possible after wehave considered the inter departmental committee&apos; s report and taken our decisions on it.(e) Having thus stated our intentions firmly, we should carry outconsultations with the industry and other organisations withinthe policy framework of the White Paper.( )      At the same time and in the light of these consultations weshould give instructions for a Bill to be prepared and to bebrought to a state of readiness for introduction at thebeginning of the next Session.V think that action on these lines will make a good firm impact, whilethe same time we shall not be rushing into detailed proposals which have notbeen properly thought, out; and I think that this plan of campaign should fit inwell with our Parliamentary timetable. I should be glad to know whether mycolleagues agree.F. Li.Ministry of Power,  S. W,l21st October, 1964
