m$ DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.( 64) 17 COPY NO:24th November, 1964PENSIONS OF MINISTERS AN33 MEMBERS OFPARLIAMENT AND OTHER MATTERSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the Cabinet (C. C. (64) 8th  Conclusions, Minute 3) invited meto arrange for rny Committee of Ministers to examine and report back on -(a) a contributory pension scheme for Members of Parliament;(b) the position of Ministers in the House of Lords in relation tothe daily attendance allowance;(c) the payment of a salary to the Leader of the Opposition and theOpposition Chief Whip in the House of Lords.My Committee has considered these points and our recommendations areas follows.Contributory Pension Scheme2.       The Recommendations of the Lawrence Committee are in para-graphs 70 to 82 and Appendix D of their Report (Command 2516).    Werecommend that they should be adopted as they stand.3.       This recommendation, if my colleagues accept it, may lead torepercussions on public service superannuation schemes, because incertain respects the Lawrence scheme is more generous than those other schemes.    The main points at which it is so are -(i)  Lawrence recommends no abatement of the House of Commonspension in respect of National Insurance pension, whereasthose who entered other public service schemes after 1948are subject to a minor degree of abatement.(ii)  The rate of accrual ( 60 a year) in the early years is high by public service standards if the pensionable salary is takento be  2, 000.    If however it is taken to be  3, 250 (and thereare sufficient grounds for this in the Lawrence Report) this problem disappears.(iii)  The scheme provides for widows (and incapacitated widowers) apension at half the husband&apos;s (or wife&apos;s) rate, with theExchequer bearing half the cost.    In most contributory publicservice schemes, the rate is one third and the member bearsthe whole cost.    The extra cost of bringing them in line withLawrence would be up to  10 million a year.
4.       7/e think however that the risks of repercussion should beaccepted.    Both the lack of abatement and the generous provisions for widows are arguably right and, moreover, for v/idows, the scalesoperated by the Trustees of the Members&apos; Fund already provide notless than half the husband&apos;s pension.    The main point however is that,with pensions as with salaries, it is most undesirable for Members ofParliament to appear to be picking and choosing among the Lawrenceproposals and thus to be acting as judges in their own cause.    the lawrence Committee was appointed to take this invidious responsibilityaway from Members;  the result can best be defended if we regardtheir findings as an award and abide by them accordingly.    The same considerations suggest that the necessary Bill should set out the termsof the pension scheme fairly fully, leaving only minor modifications(e.g. any change in contribution rates made necessary by a valuation of the Fund) to be made by Statutory Instrument.5.       A further problem concerns the House of Commons Members1Fund.    Lawrence recommends that this should continue and be used tohelp existing ex-Members (who are outside the scope of the new schemeand those who fail (through short service or incapacity) to qualify for pensions under it.    This of itself creates no large difficulties.    Thereis also, however, the question of those who already have long serviceand may receive less under the Lawrence scheme in respect of theirpast service (the maximum back service credit is 10 years) than theycould have received from the Members&apos; Fund;   or those who join thescheme in the future and qualify for a pension but one which is lessthan the maximum they could have got from the Members&apos; Fund (e, g.a man with 10 years&apos; service who dies leaving a widow).    As far as new Members at least are concerned, there are strong arguments against allowing the Fund to be used to supplement pensions under the lawrence scheme.    Any amendment to the House of CommonsMembers1 Fund Acts is a matter for the Trustees of that Fund; butwe recommend that the Trustees should be invited to re-examine thefuture needs and use of the Fund in the light of the pension schemewhich is to be set up.Sx-officio pensions6.       A number of points also arise in respect of the ex-officiopensions awarded to the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor andMr. Speaker.    One of these relates to provisions for widows.    Thereis at present no provision for a Prime Minister&apos;s widow.    There isprovision for a Lord Chancellor&apos;s widow at one third of the husband&apos;rate (the pension being paid for out of the lump sum which attaches tothe Lord Chancellor&apos;s. superannuation alone out of these ex-officiopensions).     The Speaker&apos;s widow has been dealt with ad hoc in thelegislation which is passed at the retirement of each incumbent:Mr. Speaker Morrison&apos;s widow was the first to be provided for - atone third her husband&apos;s rate - in this way.    My colleagues will wishto consider the provision for the Lord Chancellor and the PrimeMinister (together with the question whether the Lord Chancellor&apos;ssalary and pension sho\tld be dealt with wholly or partly in this bill or in separate legislation).    As regards the Speaker, we recommendthat the past practice of separate legislation ad hoc should be adhered to in the future.-2-
7.       A further problem affects the relationship of the ex-officio pensions to pensions under the Lawrence scheme.    Lawrence made no recommenda-tion on this.    But since the Lawrence scheme is generous and financedas to one half from the Exchequer, there might be criticism if bothpensions were awarded.    We recommend that those appointed to officesto which an ex-officio pension attaches should withdraw from the members&apos;scheme on appointment, should be entitled to a return of their contributionswith interest, and should cease thereafter to have any claim upon it.8.       Finally, there is the question of the existing beneficiaries of ex-officio pensions.    We do not recommend extending the new rates to them.This would be expensively repercusoive and would implicitly run counter to the Lawrence proposal that ex-Members of Parliament should not come within the scope of the new scheme.    It would however be possible toinclude in the Bill a provision making the Pensions (Increase) Acts, underwhich public service pensions generally are increased after retirement,apply to these pensions;  and my colleagues may like to consider this possibility.Ministers in the House of Lords9.       It has been suggested that Ministers in the House of Lords shouldbe allowed to draw the daily attendance allowance;  and, if the Leader ofthe Opposition and the Opposition Chief Whip in the House of Lords receivesalaries (see paragraph 10 below), that they should draw it too.    Werecommend that this should not be accepted -(a) The allowances escape taxation only on the basis that they are intended to reimburse expenses in connection with an officecarrying no remuneration.    Income tax deductions could notbe claimed against Ministerial salary for these expenses.The main expense is in fact subsistence, and any such expensesof Ministers, who are generally expected to live in London, are met out of public funds.(b) Ministers in the House of Commons receive a parliamentary salary.    Eut this is in recognition of their expenditure as members, mainly in their constituencies.    They cannot claimincome tax deductions for the cost of living in London.Leader of the Opposition and Opposition Chief Whip in the House of Lords10..      It has been puggeoted that salaries should be paid for the first timeto the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition Chief Whip in the Houseof Lords.    The Lawrence Report discussed this (paragraphs 151 to 152)without recommending either way.    We recommend that salaries shouldbe paid to these two officers, but that the line should be firmly drawn atthat point.    As regards the amount, v/e recommend  2, 000 for the leader of the Opposition and  1,500 for the Opposition Chief Whip inthe House of I*ords.    These figures include a notional  500 in lieu of the daily attendance allowance (the allowance could not be drawn as suchwithout raising the taxation difficulty referred to in paragraph 9 above).
Law Officers11.      Finally, we find that the salary of the Law Officers hastraditionally been introduced by Treasury Minute and has no statutorycover.    This had its origin in the days when the whole or part ofthese salaries were provided by fees.    It no longer seems appropriate,and might be criticised as circumscribing the opportunity for debate.We recommend that the new legislation should include provision for the salaries of all four Lav/ Officers.Timetable12.      The timetable for the Bill will be very tight if it is to get aSecond Reading and (as we should prefer if at all possible) committee stage before the Christmas Recess.    If my colleagues accept our recommendations, I suggest in the interests of Speed that the chief secretary to the Treasury (which will be the rerponsible Department)and. I should be authorised to settle any minor outstanding points withoutreferring the Bill back to the Cabinet, consulting the Prime Minister ifnecessary.H.
