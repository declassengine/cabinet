CABINETRENT bill memorandum by the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernmentIntroductionProposals for legislation to repair the damage done by the rent Act 1957 have been considered by a Committee of ministers under the chairmanship of the Lord President. At the invitation ofthe Committee I now seek authority to have a Bill prepared on thegeneral principles described in this paper.2. Rent control in its pre-1957 form is still in operation; butthe number of tenants enjoying controlled rents and security of tenure is steadily diminishing. It would not be practicable simply to restore control over the properties which were controlled before 1957.Our aim should be to devise a less rigid scheme of rent-fixing whichwill be fair to both landlord and tenant and lay the foundation fora better relationship between them. I would call this &quot; rent regulation &quot;rather than rent control. Tenants of decontrolled property coming within this scheme would have full security of tenure on Rent Actlines. For tenants outside the ambit of rent regulation, including the tenants of public authorities, and for service occupants, I propose adifferent form of security against arbitrary eviction. This is described below as &quot; basic protection &quot;.Rent regulation3. We are pledged to restore a system of rent control basedon fair rents determined by Rent Assessment Committees. I believe this to be a better basis than rents determined, as under the currentsystem, solely by reference to gross rateable values. Gross values,or any variant of them, go out of date too quickly and are for that and other reasons too unreliable to serve as a sole guide; they would produce inequitable results as between different areas and different types of property. That is not to say that they should be ignoredaltogether in fixing fair rents, and I hope to be able to devise a seriesof considerations, of which gross value would be one, which wouldbe taken into account by those charged with the duty of settlingrents. Other considerations would be the age and condition of theproperty, any improvements made, the character of the area and the printed for the Cabinet.C.

general level.of rents, passing;,,subject, however, to an. over-ridingrequirement that excessive rents attributable to scarcity would notbe admissible.4. This &quot;fair rent&apos;&apos;approach&apos;seems to me much&quot;sounder thanone based pn prescription of any form of rent ceiling. If our scheme,is to last it must cater adequately for adjustment of rent levels with changes in other economic conditions; and I Xhink the system of regulation outlined in the two immediately following paragraphswould be both fair and flexible.5. If it is to be workable, any scheme which involves setting uptribunals, or as I prefer to call them Rent Assessment Committees,should encourage landlords and tenants to reach agreement beforeappeal. That is why I propose that1 before cases reach tribunals rentofficers, appointed for the purpose, should try to reconcile differences between the parties. &apos; &apos;       &quot;6.  I propose a scheme having these main elements:.... -1 (i) We should aim at covering ; privately-rented furnished; and. . . unfurnished properties up to value limits correspondingwith those which applied before 1957. Those limits were.  100 in London and  75 elsewhere. If we now prescribed 400 in London and  200 elsewhere we would leave outof the scheme on such estimates as I have been able tomake-rather fewer properties than were left out underthe old arrangements.(ii) At the,outset the scheme should apply to the whole country,but as local housing shortages are overtaken it shouldbe possible to withdraw parts of the country. from thescheme; I would take power to do this by Ministerialorder.(iii) Existing decontrolled rents would be frozen, and could be altered (upwards or downwards) only by the following procedure. If the landlord and tenant agreed a new rent(or the present rent) they would have it registered by alocal rent officer. In the case of periodic tenanciesregistration would fix the rent for, say, three years. Ifthey could not agree they would refer to the rent officer who would attempt to secure their acceptance of hisown determination. If accepted, this would become the registered rent; otherwise it would take effect as an interim rent, payable by the tenant pending reference tothe Rent Assessment Committee. The tribunats decisions would be registered and would replace the interim rent.(iv) The rents of new lettings should all be brought underreview by the rent officer at an early stage.(v) Existing controlled rents should be subject to adjustmentby the same method; but it might be necessary to impose a delay before such cases could be brought before rentofficers or tribunals to avoid these being swamped.
&quot; 7. There are three possible ways of securing good and effectiverent officers. They could be officers of the local authority; or officersattached to County Courts; or they could be attached to a newtribunal structure-^a form of rent service. Each.course has advantages and disadvantages. The Committee of Ministers which has examined the proposals favours attachment to local authorities;; and by thetime this paper is considered by the Cabinet I shall have had a talk with local authority representatives and may be able to report thatthey accept this general principle. If it is adopted, it will be necessaryto prevent Council Committees from seeking to influence the action taken by rent officers and it will probably also be necessary to arrangefor the costs of administration to be carried by the Exchequer.Arrangements for the appointment and dismissal of rent officers willhave to be gone into in detail with the associations of local authorities.8. The word &quot; tribunal &quot;has a legal flavour and has also cometo be associated with rent control. That is why I prefer the name&quot; rent assessment committees &quot;. They need not in all cases have alegally-qualified chairman and my aim would be that each of them should cover as big an area as could conveniently be dealt with. Iintend to discuss with the Lord Chancellor how we may best setabout appointing the committees and determining their areas.9. Existing tenants of controlled property will continue to enjoy the security of tenure given by the Rent Acts, under which they canbe dispossessed only on a strictly limited number of grounds. Thesame degree of protection will be given to tenants whose rents are brought back into control by the new scheme of rent regulation. Ihave considered whether there is any need to add redevelopment tothe grounds for possession which are set out in the Rent Act, 1933.I do not think there is. Provided that he can produce evidence of alternative accommodation, there is nothing to stop a landlordapplying to the court for possession on account of redevelopment andnothing to stop the court considering his claim; and if, as I assume,we would regard the provision of alternative accommodation as asine qua non there appears to be no need to alter the existing arrangements.Security for tenants and licencees not in rent-regulated properties:basic protection10. The present law in England and Wales provides very littlesecurity for the tenant of property which is not rent-controlled.Under our new scheme we shall provide full security for those whoserents are regulated. But the scheme will not apply to tenants of properties outside whatever limits we determine, to tenants invarious forms of publicly-owned property, or to service licencees;and I think that those people ought now to be given protection against arbitrary eviction. The same protection will also be applicable, if and when rent regulation is lifted from any part ofthe country, to all tenants in the area so freed.11. The Protection from Eviction Bill, which will expire atthe end of 1965, will make it an offence for the owner of a property5172
within the jurisdiction of the County Court--i.e., having a net annual value of  400. or less-t-to: enforce his right to possession without anorder from that court. As the Bill is no more than a holding measureuntil the main legislation can come into force it provides lengthenedsecurity of tenure by the simplest and least controversial means---extending County Court discretion in granting suspension of ordersfor possession. The Bill provides for: suspension up to 12 months.12.  I propose that we should include in the Rent Bill permanentprovisions against arbitrary eviction based on the same general approach-no eviction without a court order;no change in the law about duration of notice in periodictenancies (a weekly tenant is entitled to four weeks&apos;notice); andthe County Courts to be given discretion to suspend actionon possession orders.The 12 months&apos; discretion provided for by the Bill is, however, too long as a permanent arrangement. It is certainly too long for theservice occupancies and certain other categories to which I should like the basic security of tenure to apply. I think the right coursewould be to provide for suspension at the discretion of the court forup to two months. In considering this period it is important to remember that four weeks is the minimum period of notice which any tenant is bound to have. Generalisation about the time taken before the courts can deal with cases can be misleading, but if we assume three to four weeks, then the period from giving notice tothe time when the tenant actually has to move is being extended upto three or four months, which seems to me adequate.13. It would be right that this basic protection should extend to properties of any value, even though this will mean that thejurisdiction of County Courts will have to be enlarged to enablethem to deal with issues affecting properties in excess of  400 net annual value.14. The basic protection ought in my view to extend also to several kinds of letting which have hitherto been exempted fromprovisions for the protection of the tenant or occupier. The main categories are direct lettings from the Crown, lettings of council or other publicly-owned houses and lettings of houses occupied bypeople under licence as part of their employment. If the provisions for basic protection are applied to these lettings it will be necessaryto consider giving the landlords special grounds for claiming earlypossession. I shall consider this further with the Ministers directly concerned. I am already in touch with the Minister of Agricultureabout occupants of agricultural-tied cottages; and so far as localauthorities are concerned I shall discuss this with them.Furnished lettings15. Furnished lettings are covered by the Protection fromEviction Bill. But there are some objections to giving tenants of
furnished premises, on a permanent basis, the same forms of securityas are given to tenants of unfurnished premises. The simplest coursewould be to preserve the existing arrangements under the Acts of1946 and 1949, which enable rent tribunals to grant security for upto three months at a time. But I understand that this form ofprotection does not prevent serious oppression of furnished tenants,and it may be necessary to give them greater protection. In thisconnection it may also be necessary to include in the Bill provisions to make various forms of intimidation by landlords a criminal offence. These matters are being further examined and, subject tothe Cabinefs general approval of the principles outlined in this paper, I hope at a later stage to submit proposals both aboutprotection for furnished lettings and about intimidation to theCommittee of Ministers.Conclusion16. I now seek authority, subject to further examination ofparticular points with the Ministers concerned, for preparation of aRent Bill embodying the principles set out above.R. H. S.
