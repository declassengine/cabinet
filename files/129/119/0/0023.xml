SURMA-WAR DAMAGE CLAIMSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at a meeting on 24th November, 1964, the legislation committee considered a proposal and draft Bill, presented jointly bythe Financial Secretary to the Treasury, the Attorney-General andthe Lord Advocate, the purpose of which is to deny the admissibilityin law of certain types of compensation claims against the Crown,including a particular group of past claims now subject to litigationarising from the &quot; scorched earth &quot; policy during the war in Burma.2. The Committee were disposed to agree that legislation ofthe kind proposed should be introduced, notwithstanding the undesirability in principle of retroactive legislation, but they wishedto seek endorsement of their view, as well as a decision on the timing of any legislation, and accordingly invited the Financial Secretaryto arrange for the whole matter to be submitted to the Cabinet.The Burma Claims3. The problem stems from a judgment in the House of Lordsthis year in relation to claims against the Crown by subsidiaries ofthe Burmah Oil Company for compensation for properties and installations destroyed by the Crown in order to deny their use tothe enemy, during the Japanese advance in Burma in 1942. Theclaims of the subsidiaries of the Burmah Oil Company themselvesamount to  31 million, plus interest. If further actions, at presentstayed, are added, the total of all the claims involved amounts toover  100 million. There must also be many other unsatisfied claims arising out of damage sustained in comparable circumstances in burma, but as the events took place more than 22 years ago, anyfurther proceedings would now appear to be time-barred under bothEnglish and Scottish law.4. A history of the dispute up to the recent judgment of theHouse of Lords is annexed from which it will be seen that all british Governments since the war have made it abundantly clear to the claimants that they were not in any circumstances prepared to entertain their claims. Two points of special interest should benoted:(a) In   1948  His   Majesty&apos;s   Government   made   available,ex gratia, the sum of  10 million to be distributed amongCONFIDENTIAL5099 printed for the Cabinet. December 1964C. (64) 23 Copy No.1st December, 1964CABINET
those who had suffered loss in Burma. Of this sum thesubsidiaries of the Burmah Oil Company receivedapproximately  4^ million, virtually all of which wasadmittedly paid on claims in respect of demolitions.Although no agreement was obtained from the recipientsit was made clear to them that no further payments would follow. (Paragraph 6 of Annex.)(b) In 1962, after proceedings by the four subsidiaries of theBurmah Oil Company had been raised against the Crownin the Scottish Courts, a warning was addressed to allthe 12 Companies that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould introduce legislation to indemnify the Crownretrospectively in the event of the claimants obtainingfavourable judgments in the courts. (Paragraph 13 of annex.)5. The action so far has followed the Scottish procedure, underwhich principles of law applicable to the case are settled before proof of facts. The recent judgment of the House of Lords decides that damage suffered by prerogative acts may in certain circumstances bethe subject of claims for compensation in the courts. The companies have now to pursue their claims against the Crown and the defencemay be briefly considered in three stages:(a) There are certain further points of law under which theCrown could seek to escape liability, but we are advised that the case on these is less strong than the legal point which has now been decided against the Crown.(b) On evidence of fact we could seek to dispute the claimants&apos;contentions about the purpose and circumstances of thedemolitions, but with varying chances of successdepending on the evidence we are able to bring forwardafter the lapse of time that has taken place.(c) Following the suggestions in obiter dicta in the recentjudgments, we could resist other than a minimalassessment of damages on the grounds that the propertiesin question were in any case about to fall into enemyhands and that their value to their owners was therefor of a token character. It seems likely that the courts wouldtake into account the factor of the imminent approach of the enemy, but it is difficult to forecast to what extent the total claims would be diminished by this factor. Thecourts would almost certainly take into consideration theex gratia payments already made, but these might not beanything like enough to extinguish the diminished claims.6. In previous discussions and correspondence with the claimants the Government has consistently taken the view that itwould not be justified, given the circumstances of the demolitionsand at this stage in time, in making any payments of compensation to the claimants, beyond what they received under the  10 millionex gratia payment.
Wider Implications of the Judgment7. Although the decision of the House of Lords is theoreticallylimited to Scottish law, there may be far-reaching implications in english law as well, since the House of Lords said (obiter) thatEnglish law was the same. It has always been thought in both countries that acts done by or on the authority of the Crown in the defenceof the Realm fall within one of three categories: those which arelawful at common law and give no right of action to anyone affectedby them; those unlawful at common law which give a right of action for damages to anyone affected; and those unlawful at common lawbut authorised by Statute, the aggrieved person&apos;s right to damagesbeing replaced by a statutory right to compensation in accordancewith a specified procedure. It now appears that some of the actslawful at common law may give to persons affected a right to&quot; compensation &quot; which is in principle indistinguishable from theright to damages in respect of unlawful acts.8. This concept is based largely on the works of continentaljurists whose writings influenced the development of Scottish lawin the 17th and 18th centuries; but they have never been regardedas authorities by English law, and the concept is wholly novel inthe law of England. There would not appear to be in principle anylogical justification for it; and its ambit has been left vague by therecent decision, which proceeds upon a line of distinction (uncertainand difficult to apply in practice) between those lawful acts which do,and those which do not, give to persons affected by them a right to compensation.Further Action by Her IVIajesty&apos;s Government9. For these reasons we consider that the legal positionresulting from the House of Lords judgment is clearly unsatisfactory,and that it should be amended by appropriate legislation as far asthe future is concerned. The more difficult decision relates to the burma claims arising from the past. As far as these are concerned,we are left now with the choice of:(a) giving a further warning to the claimants in the hope ofdeterring them from further proceedings;(b) taking no action, thus allowing litigation to proceed, in thehope of an ultimate award of damages so small thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government would not be called upon for any payment beyond what has already been madeunder the  10 million ex gratia payment; and,(c) introducing retroactive legislation to defeat at once the burma claims.10. The Legislation Committee did not question the view thatthe Government should not make any further payments in respectof the Burma claims. It seems to me that this view can well be defended in equity, indeed it is a view which has been shared by all governments of all parties since the ex gratia payments were offered in 1948. If this view is to be maintained, it appears that retroactivelegislation is likely to be unavoidable.5099
11. The chance of deterring the claimants by a further warningnow after they have ignored one clear warning and enjoyed a subsequent success in litigation, must surely be discounted. It couldbe argued, particularly in view of the warning already given, thatwe would lose nothing by allowing litigation to proceed, reserving the possibility of legislation as a last resort. Against this, it seems likely that the objections against retroactive legislation would becomestronger once litigation had been concluded in favour of the claimants,and the Government would be open to criticism for having allowed the case to be pursued, at substantial cost, long after the need for legislation had become apparent.12. It is tempting to point to the possibility of a minimalassessment of damages at the end of litigation on the basis indicatedin paragraph 5 (c) above, but it would be unduly optimistic to expectso satisfactory a result on the issue as it now appears, following the judgment of the House of Lords. Any less satisfactory result would place the Government in the embarrassing position of having,after all, and in the face of strong criticism at that stage, to presentretroactive legislation.13. The foregoing comments suggest that it would be right topresent legislation at once, rather than await the outcome of litigation.It was suggested in Legislation Committee that, since the Governmentare at present under some criticism for disregarding legal rights, itmight be better to defer legislation until the next Session on theassumption that it would still be possible to get the legislation throughbefore the present proceedings were completed. I think the objectionsto this are twofold. First, the claimants would have a powerfulground of complaint if they were allowed now to continue their action only to have it defeated by retrospective legislation at thedoors of the court. This would add to the criticism of the retroactivity.Secondly, there is much advantage in legislating at once in pursuanceof the warning given by the previous Government. The more wedelay, the more we will have to shoulder ourselves the odium oflegislating retrospectively.Conclusions14.  I recommend:(a) that the Cabinet should endorse the view previouslymaintained by Her Majesty&apos;s Governments, that no further payments should be made in respect of the Burma claims;(b)* that the Cabinet should authorise the introduction oflegislation, with retroactive effect on the Burma claims,in the form accepted, subject to one drafting point, by legislation Committee.J. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,1st December, 1964.
AnnexHISTORY OF THE &quot; BURMA DENIALS&quot; DISPUTEDenial Actions taken in 19421. During the Japanese advance into Burma early in 1942,certain properties and installations were destroyed on orders fromthe G.O.C. Army in Burma, in order to deny their use and value tothe enemy. These demolitions have given rise to claims for compensation whose potential total, based on full valuation andaccrued interest, could be over  100 million.H.M. Governments Policy on Compensation2. H.M. Governments policy regarding compensation whichwas applicable to Burma as to other dependent territories was statedin the House of Commons on the 18th February, 1943, in thefollowing terms:&quot; It will be the general aim of His Majesty&apos;s government after the War that, with a view to the well-being of the people and the resumption of productive activity, property and goodsdestroyed or damaged in the Colonial Empire shall be replacedor repaired to such an extent and over such period of time asresources permit. If the resources of any part of the colonial empire are insufficient to enable this purpose to be achieved without aid, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready to givewhat assistance they could in conjunction with such CommonFund or Organisation as may be established for Post-war reconstruction &quot;.This announcement makes it clear that it was the part of colonial territories to provide funds in the first instance, and that.M. Government would only help where Colonial resources were insufficient. Secondly, the object was to provide for rehabilitationrather than full compensation.3. In 1946 Claims Commissions were set up by H.M.Government in Burma and other Far Eastern Colonies to registerand assess claims. It was made clear that this did not commiteither H.M. Government or the local Governments to any specificform or amount of compensation. The Burma Claims Commissionreceived claims totalling approximately  165 million. Of this total british-European claims amounted to  67 million, Burmese claims to  64 million, Indian claims to  27 million, and other claims to 7 million. In the total of  67 million for British-European claims 60 million was for denials (i.e., claims resulting from deliberatedemolitions), while claims in this category from other nationalitieswere negligible. The Commission did not attempt to assess the validity of the claims.Burma&apos;s Refusal to Compensate4. During the discussions with the Burmese Finance delegation which visited the United Kingdom in September 1947 to considerthe implications of Burma&apos;s forthcoming independence, the Burmesemade it clear that their Government did not propose to introduceany War Damage Compensation Scheme. In August 1947 the advice
of the Law Officers was sought. Their advice was that the claimantsappeared to have a valid right to compensation from the Governmentof Burma under the Defence of Burma Rules, but no claim atcommon law against the Crown.Meetings with Burma Chamber of Commerce5. Representatives of British commercial interests who had suffered heavy losses through the denial actions met the Ministerfor Economic Affairs (Sir Stafford Cripps) in October. Theyattempted to place the moral responsibility on ELM. Government.The Minister recommended that British interests should pursue thematter in the Courts of Burma. In reply to a Question he said thatthe possibility of bringing a case against H.M. Government would depend on the findings of the Burmese Courts. In the meantime,he was prepared to consider an advance to businesses which werein real need. Suits for compensation for denial damage were filed inthe Rangoon High Court in December 1947. The Burma government made it clear from the beginning that they accepted no liability.Orders had been issued providing for determination ofcompensation payable under the Defence of Burma Rules, but these orders specifically excluded &quot; Compensation payable in respect of damage caused by War operations&quot; and so excluded compensationfor denial claims. In July 1947 the Defence of Burma Act itselfexpired. Burma took the view that since the British had been liable for the defence of Burma in 1942 they should pay compensation notonly for damage arising from denial actions but for all war damage.The Burmese Government alleged that the suits were time-barred:that no claims lay at common law because the damage arose out ofevents connected with military necessity: and that as the Defence of burma Act had expired there was no longer a statutory right to compensation. In a letter of 11th February, 1948, the BurmeseDefence Minister stated that:&quot; The Union Government are not in a financial position tomeet these claims and will take all necessary measures to avoidpayment.&quot;It was added that the Burmese intended to bring pressure to bearon H.M. Government to meet the claims.Ex gratia Payment of  10 million6. In the meantime H.M. Government gave furtherconsideration to the possibility of an ex gratia payment. On 29thJune, 1948, representatives of the Burma Chamber of Commercemet the Prime Minister, Mr. Attlee, and Sir Stafford Cripps (thenChancellor of the Exchequer). At this meeting, the Chancellor agreedthat the claimants had a case in equity for some measure of help,and undertook to consider how much H.M. Government could afford to&apos; give as an ex gratia payment. He warned them that any sum offered would be for rehabilitation rather than compensation,and would be a final figure. There would be no more to follow.On 9th September, he saw the representatives again, and told themthat he could offer  10 million. In arriving at this figure account wastaken of the fact that a sum also of  10 million was being givento i the Malayans to assist in their rehabilitation scheme. The
representatives of the Burma Chamber of Commerce weredisappointed at this Government proposal, and commented thattheir best course might be to pursue their case against Burma andthen, if this was unsuccessful, to bring a case against H.M.Government. The Chancellor said that they were at liberty to do so.No undertaking to abandon their claims was extracted from thecompanies upon receipt of the ex gratia grant. The reason for thisomission is not clear, but it seems to have arisen from a desire notto prejudice any rights the claimants might have against the BurmeseGovernment. The grant was provided through Votes, and was distributed to companies by an independent tribunal. Distributionof the fund was not limited to those who had suffered through thedenials; all United Kingdom businesses which had suffered losses from war damage in Burma and needed help in rehabilitation wereeligible to share in the  10 million.Further Representations by Burma Chamher of Commerce7. Between 1949 and 1959 a Test Case was pursued in the HighCourts of Burma, but the companies became increasingly aware thatno money would anyhow be forthcoming from the BurmeseGovernment. They made two further applications for aid from H.M.Government. The first, a Memorandum dated 16th June, 1952, tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Butler), suggested that, sincethe Companies were being frustrated by the Burmese authorities in bringing the action which Sir Stafford Cripps had encouraged, H.M.Government should treat the claims as a debt of honour and havethem assessed by an independent arbitration tribunal. In reply, theChancellor refused to accept on behalf of the United Kingdomtaxpayer any further obligation for war losses in Burma.8. The second application, dated 8th May, 1956, and addressedto Mr. Macmillan who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer, took a more threatening line. The Chamber had been advised that a stronglegal case rested against H.M. Government, on the grounds that thedenials had been carried out on the initiative of the War Cabinet,rather than the Governor, and in defence of India rather than Burma.It was argued that there was anyhow a strong obligation on H.M.Government to make a further ex gratia grant. The Chancellor, ina reply dated 6th July, 1956, refused to accept that any obligationremained on H.M. Government; he told the Companies that evenif they were unsuccessful in the Burmese Courts, they could not expect H.M. Government to make a further ex gratia contribution.Failure of Test Cases against Burmese Government9. The Burma Chamber of Commerce informed the chancellor in a letter of 26th October, 1960, that judgment had been givenagainst the Indo-Burma Petroleum Company. The three maingrounds on which the Burma High Court rejected the case were:(1) the Burma Defence Act and Rules, 1940, under which compensation was claimed had expired;(2) although the claimants might have had a right to compensation against the Burma Government if theproperty had been requisitioned for administrativepurposes (on the basis of the de-Keyser case), the denial
action taken involving demolition and destruction ofproperty in the face of the enemy was clearlydistinguishable;(3) the Governor had acted under military necessity and in anational emergency, and the Government of Burma wastherefore not liable at law on the application of theprinciple involved in the legal maxim &quot; salus populi estsuprema lex &quot;.Proceedings instituted against H.1VL- Government10. The Chamber of Commerce then returned to theirargument that they had been advised that there was a strong case against H.M. Government for legal liability and that the claim wasnot barred by any provisions of limitation. At the end of October1961 summonses were served on the Lord Advocate in the Courtof Session for Scotland by four subsidiaries of the Burmah oil company, for amounts totalling some  31 million, plus interest.Summonses were later served by eight other companies. Whilstsubsequent litigation has been confined to the first four companies,it is reasonable to assume that the result will be an important factor in determining the course of action on the remaining claims.11. The course of litigation has been in accordance with Scottishpractice, which provides for obtaining a decision of the courts onthe law applicable to the case prior to hearing evidence on the facts.Accordingly, the substance of litigation so far has been addressed tothe question whether the exercise of the Royal Prerogative in causing the demolitions gives or denies a claim in law for compensation forthe persons who have suffered loss thereby.12. The first judgment favoured the claimants, the appeal courtreversed the decision, and the judgment delivered on the companies&apos;appeal to the House of Lords now reinstates, by a margin of threeagainst two, the first judgment in favour of the claimants. The wayis now open, therefore, for the claimants to prove in the courts thefacts which would now entitle them to compensation and anevaluation of their claims.H.M. Governments Warning to Claimants13.   In June 1962, after proceedings in the Scottish Courtsbegan, all the companies concerned were informed that, if theyproceeded with their war damage claims and were successful in thecourts, legislation would be introduced to nullify the effects of the judgment. The letter sent to them included the following sentences:&quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government are moreover satisfied that theclaim made is not in any event one which ought to be met bythe British taxpayer. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly decided that, in the unlikely event of your company succeeding,legislation would be introduced to indemnify the Crown and its officers, servants or agents against your company&apos;s claim.&quot;Publication of the contents of this letter, during the hearing in thefirst court, gave rise to much criticism in the Scottish Press, and wasadversely commented upon by the presiding judge. The companiescontinued their cases undeterred.
