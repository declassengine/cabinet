C. (64) 19 COPY NO.      5 923rd November, 1964CABINETTIMING OF INCREASED NATIONAL INSURANCE and assistance benefits memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in C. (64) 18 the Minister of Pensions and National Insurancedescribes possible schemes for advancing the date of payment of these benefits.    1 think it would be helpful to my colleagues if I set out what this could mean for public expenditure; I have of course to look at theproblem from this point of view and not simply in the context of theNational Insurance Funds.2.       If the scheme for double payments set out in C. (64) 18 were limited to national insurance retirement pensions, the extra cost ofeach double payment would be   20 million.    Extension to national insurance widows7 benefits would cost a further  2 million each time.If it were necessary also to include war widows and industrial and wardisablement pensioners, this would add afurther sum   of more than 2 million on each occasion.    The total cost of this part of the scheme would therefore range between  20 and  25 million for one doublepayment, between   40 and  50 million for two and between  60 and 75 million for three*.3.       In addition, the arrangements proposed for national assistance would cost  4 million.    In short, a scheme to provide advance paymentscould not cost less than  24 million and might cost as much a.s 79 million.4.       Against this, introduction of the increased contribution ratesfrom 8th March 1965 would produce  15 million from insured persons and employers.     (And if it proved possible to bring therr. into effecteven earlier the additional receipts would be  5 million per week).For the reasons given in my first paragraph the Exchequer supplement to the Funds - see paragraph 18 of C. (64) 18 - cannot be regardedas an offset to the additional cost.The decision already taken to bring forward short-term benefits to 25th January 1965 is roughly the equivalent of 2 double payments to pensioners.    To bring forward the date for short-term benefits to correspond  with 3 double payments to pensioners would cost about   6 million more.-1-document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER.

5.       This has to be seen against the background of the followingdecisions &apos; which we have already taken and which have added to public expenditure in 1964/65:-  millionNational Assistance discretionarypayments 6Bringing forward of date of introductionof short-term benefits 10JSarlier date for abolition of .widow&apos;earnings rule 2Total 186.       My colleagues will recall that on 29th November they asked that the paper discussing the cost of advancing the effective date of payment of the approved increase in national insurance benefits shouldbe &quot;on the assumption that the date of the increase in contributions would be similarly advanced&quot;    (C. C. (64) 9th Conclusions, Item 2(a)).It will be seen that if 8th March stands a.s the earliest date at which increased contribution rates can be introduced, there would be a net increase in public expenditure of  9-14 million,  29-39 million or 49-64 million according as there were one, two or three doublepayments.L.
