CONra&amp;NTIAL18SIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 government. (64) 20 COPY NC.        I&apos; :24th November, 1964CABINETCHILDREN&apos;S SERVICE IN GREATER london:.emorandura by the Lord President of the CouncilThis paper poses the question, which has been considered bya meeting of Ministers under my chairmanship, whether we should introduce a Bill in the current Session to enable the Greater london council (G, I., C.) to exercise certain functions in the field of childcare.Undertakings2. An undertaking was given by the present Secretary of Statefor Education and Science in the debate on the Third Reading of theLondon Government Bill in the following terms:&quot;If the change of Government occurs this year we shallrepeal the Bill.    If the change of Government occursafter the new borough councils are elected fi. e. in April1964/ we shall halt the transfer of functions and the break-up of the social services which the Bill seeks to effect. &quot;(Official Report, 2nd April, 1963, Col. 399).In July, 1964, Mr, Arthur Skeffington, as Chairr/ian of the LabourParty Local Government Committee, gave the following furtherundertaking:&quot;I wish to give the assurance that it is our intention toprevent the break-up of those parts /i. e.  of the LondonChildren&apos;s Service/ which require administration over a wide area.    In any future scheme the -London boroughswill be asked to undertake day-to-day administration,leaving the specialised services, training of staff and matters of that kind to an authority covering a widerarea. &quot;Proposals3. In accordance with these undertakings proposals have beenput forward by the Home Secretary to amend the London government act so as to lay on the G. L. G. responsibility for the following:(a)      approved schools-i-
(b) institutions now administered by the -London County Counciland the Middlesex County Council, (but not those adminis-tered by other counties or by county boroughs) as follows:-(i)  remand homes(ii)  large children^ homes(iii)  specialised children1 s homes (including receptioncentres)(c) staff training(d) statistics and research(e) prescription of parental contributions and boarding-outallowances(f) general supervision over the provision, by the boroughs, of residential accommodation for children, with concurrentpowers to provide specialised accommodationThe individual boroughs would continue to be responsible for child care in the field, that is for preventive work with the family, for receivingchildren into care and boarding them out, and for the administration ofsmall children&apos;s homes for their own use.    The functions which it isproposed to transfer to the G. I... C. are those which concern more thanone borough and can conveniently be exercised over a wider area.4. My Committee believe that these proposals are right on the merits.    They have been urged upon us by our own supporters on theG. L. C,, and consultation through party channels suggests that in themajority of boroughs also our supporters would like to see this work done by the G, L. C.The time factor5. The proposed Bill would have to be passed in time for theG. L. C. to be ready to operate the services concerned from 1st April,1965, the date on which, as the lav/ now stands, the new boroughs willtake over as chiidren&apos;s authorities for ail purposes.    There must besufficient margin of time to allow for the consequential orders which wihave to be made under the London Government Act to re-allocate staff and property (say, in practice, by mid-March at latest).    At best, itwould be necessary for the G. L, C. to embark on their preparationswell before the Bill becomes lav/, that is in conditions of some uncertainty.6. The Bill will be politically controversial.    The Conservativeboroughs v/ill oppose it, and there are some arguments on the meritsthat can be advanced against us.    Some of the Labour boroughs, whenthey are consulted officially and receive the advice of their ownchildren&apos;s officers, may prefer to keep the undivided responsibilitylaid on them by the London Government Act for the whole range ofchildren&apos;s services and to rely on arrangements which have alreadybeen worked out for sharing those facilities, and in particular the accommodation in four large L, G. C. children1 s homes, which willhave to be used by more than one authority.-2-COMFSDENTSAL
7. The Bill will not be a simple one-ciau.se measure.    It willprobably have to be taken on the floor of the House and it will offer theOpposition an opportunity to attack us on political grounds and to adoptdelaying tactics as a means of holding up other measures.    My Committeewere clear that the Bill could not be introduced until the HomeSecretary had consulted the G. L. C. and the borough councils formally.We should expose ourselves to unnecessary criticism if we relied oninformal consultation with our own supporters.     The Home secretary would naturally press for early replies from, the councils, butconsultation would be likely to delay the introduction of a Bill for amatter of weeks.    There is a risk, to put it no higher, that the Billmay be declared hybrid.8. We are thus faced with two difficulties:(a) The Bill may be passed so late that it will be difficult orimpossible for the G. L, C. to complete in time those arrangements, such as the re-allocation of property andthe selection and appointment of senior professional staff,which cannot be settled until the statute is enacted, -existing I.. C. C. and Middlesex County Council staff having already accepted borough appointments;   and, more serious,(b) if the Bill could be introduced before Christmas it wouldcompete with other of our own urgent measures which canbe got ready early, while if it cannot be introduced until later, it will compete with major items in our main programme.We must recognise that if we introduce this Bill some other Bill willhave to be sacrificed.The alternative9. The Committee considered feat if the Cabinet decided that this measure, desirable though it might be on merits, could not be given priority over others, we should say publicly that it was clearly notpossible at this stags, in view of the steps already taken by the London boroughs to assume their new responsibilities, to preserve fee L. C. C, &apos;schildren&apos;s service;  that we had considered whether short of this itv/ould be practicable to transfer to the G. L. C, certain responsibilities which could conveniently be exercised over the area as a whole;  but thatwe had come to the conclusion feat, in the time available and in thelight of fee Governments other urgent and important commitments, thiswas not possible.    We would, however, review fee working of feeLondon Government Act after a period, of years and we v/ould not rule out fee possibility of amending the arrangements if they proved not tobe working satisfactorily.10. The Act provides for a review of its provisions on educationafter five years, but there is no statutory obligation to review feearrangements for the chilclren&apos;s service, and my Committee recognisedthat a promise to undertake such a review would be largely illusory, sinceafter five years it would be extremely difficult to deprive fee boroughsof functions which they had become accustomed to exercising.-3-
K.B.Whitehall, S. W. 1.24th November, 1964II. The questions on which we seek the cabinet&apos;s guidance are:(i)     Should legislation be introduced this Session?(ii)     If so, what are we prepared to forgo in order to find thenecessary Parliamentary time?(iii)     Should we make a statement on the lines set out in paragraph?
