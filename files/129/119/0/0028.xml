CO-OPERAtiON BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OFECONOMIC AFFAIRS AND THE treasury the functions of the two Departments and the relationship between them, as well as their relationships with the otherDepartments of Government, must reflect the &quot;unity in diversity&quot;of economic policy.Both Departments will be centres of co-ordination; this calls forthe highest possible degree of co-operation between the two departments in order to preserve the unity and Coherence ofeconomic policy. In particular each Department will consult the otherbefore proposing any substantial departure from agreed policies.Statements of the functions of each Department are annexed.Underlying these are two broad concepts of the basis of the division between them. First, that the Department of Economic Affairs is primarily responsible for the long-term aspects of economic policy,while the Treasury is primarily responsible for the short-term aspects.Secondly, a primary concern of the new Department will be withphysical resources while a primary concern of the Treasury will, befinance.Neither of these distinctions is in fact absolute; and reference to&quot; primary &quot; concern or responsibility does not mean either &quot; only &quot;or &quot; exclusive&quot;. Short-term measures must be handled asconsistently as possible with the long-term objectives of the economy;and measures aiming at long-term advantages cannot succeed unless their short-term effects can be accepted. Consideration of short-term and long-term aspects of policy tend to come together. Similarly, overthe great part of the economy, financial considerations and questions concerning the allocation of physical resources are inseparable.Two aspects of co-operation need emphasis.(a) Economic analysis and forecastingAt the working level there must be a common understandingthroughout Departments and particularly between theDepartment of Economic Affairs and the Treasury of the basisupon which the relevant facts about the economy are organised^the methods of analysis and the first steps in the interpretation of the statistics thrown up. For this purpose officials engaged on this work will be regarded as a &quot; joint forecasting staff &quot;making their respective contribution to the analysis and joiningin the interpretation. While the Department of Economic affairs will be primarily responsible for the longer-term aspects of this work, and the Treasury will be primarily responsible for the shorter-term aspects, the work will as far as practicable becarried out under a common direction.(b) The Public SectorAn essential part of a plan for national economic development is that there should be a coherent long-term plan
for public sector expenditure and taxation fitting in with thenational economic development plan both in total, and in the priorities accorded to the various programmes within the total,and with the economic effects both of expenditure and taxationjudged in felation to the objectives of;the plan. &apos; &apos;  &apos;     - - &apos;&apos; ,It will be the objective of both Departments to ensure, thatall decisions about public expenditure clearly reflect the agreedpriorities laid down in the economic development plan. &quot;The procedure will be as follows; The Treasury has regularmachinery for obtaining from Departments their forecasts ofexpenditure and receipts (both short-term and long-term) and thisis an indispensable part of the control of the public finances. It&apos; is:to the Treasury that Departments must continue to turn for theauthorisation of: expenditure outside the limits of their delegated&apos;authority. The Treasury will continue to make regular surveys ofpublic expenditure and the Department of Economic Affairs willjoin with the Treasury in the central direction of ithis &quot;work and ininter-departmental discussions leading to the formulation of thepart to be played by the public sector in the plan, having regardto the effects on growth and the burden on real resources. For each;area of public sector expenditure a working arrangement will bemade between the two Departments, so as to provide a network of mutual information and consultation.FUNCTIONS OF THE TREASURY;       - -   . - .L-nManagement of Public Services \   :The Treasury will retain its managerial responsibility for the&apos;Civil Service and other public services, including pay. It will work closely with the Department of Economic Affairs where Civil service pay questions impinge on incomes policy.II. Public Sector Expenditure and Receipts- The: Treasury will retain its responsibility for public sector,expenditure and receipts, including the Budget, working closely with;the Department of Economic Affairs on those aspects which affect:the national development plan and the economic effects of public sector expenditure and receipts generally.Ill-finance the Treasury will be responsible for home and overseas finance,and monetary policy; this includes overseas financial relations,balance of payments, the reserves, financial aspects of invisible trade,export finance and exchange control.
FUNCTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICAFFAIRSI. Formulation of the plan for economic development in conjunction with the other Departments concerned theDepartment will:id) prepare medium-term,  long-term  and  very  long-rangeforecasts of the development of the economy; and(b) construct models of how the economy can and should develop.(This work will be steered by a high level inter-departmentalcommittee under the chairmanship of the Permanent Under-Secretaryof State reporting to the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee on economic development.)II. Supervising the implementation of the plan the Department will be responsible for co-ordinating the workof other Departments in implementing the plan and in particular for the following aspects:id) policy towards industry; .(b) regional policy;(c) incomes policy; and Id) other policies directed to economic growth.III. Other aspects of economic policy the Secretary of State&apos;s Committee on Economic development will be the forum for considering other issues in the economic field which require collective consideration by Ministers. Where such issues require inter-departmental official consideration they will normally be taken at the high level Committee under the permanent under-Secretary of State. In particular the Department will providethe machinery for the inter-departmental consideration of questionsof external economic policy.The Secretary of State will be Chairman of the national economic Development Council and (if it continues to exist) theNational Production Advisory Council for Industry, while theDepartment will be responsible for the National economic development Office and (if they continue to exist) for the regional boards for Industry.The Secretary of State and the Department will be responsiblefor the co-ordination of information on the broad aspects ofeconomic policy.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th December, 1964.
