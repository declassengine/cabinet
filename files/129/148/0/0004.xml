ANUEXBEAGLE AIRCRAFT XJl/flTBDOpinion of the Attorney &quot;General and Mr0 .J,P,F*EV. WarnerWe are asked to advise upon the following questions arising inconnection with the affairs of Beagle Aircraft Ximitsds-&apos;(l)     -wheSheX&quot; the directors of She company might be liable In civil orcriminal proceedings;, the material provisions of the CompaniesAct 1948 being sections 330 and 332j(2)    whether any implied commitments for Her majestys Governmentarose from the directors4&apos; actions?(3)    whether the Minister of Technology could be the subject of criticism in a creditor1 s action against the Minister or inthe course of a winding up? and(4)    generally, as to the principles that should guide the ministry in other similar cases02C      Section 330 of the Companies Act 1948 provides^-&quot;1  any person, being at the time of the commission of the allegedoffence an officer of a company which is subsequently ordered to be wound up by the court or subsequently passes a resolutionfor voluntary winding up* -has by false pretences or by means of any other fraud induced anyperson to give credit to the companyjwith intent to defraud creditors of the company, has made orcaused to be made any gift or transfer of or charge on, or has caused or connived at the levying of any execution against, theproperty of the company;with intent to defraud creditors of the company, has concealed orremoved any part of the property of the company since, or within two months before, the date of any unsatisfied judgment or order for payment of money obtained against the company,&quot;he shall be guilty of a, misdemeanour and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a termnot exceeding twelve months&quot;.
There is no evidence before us to suggest that the directors are guilty of offences against that section^,30      Subsections (l) and (3) of section 332 of that Act provide;-(l)   &quot;If in the course of the winding up of a company it appears that anybusiness of the company has been carried on with intent to defraudcreditors of the company or creditors of any other person or fox-any fraudulent purpose,, the court, on the application of theofficial receiver, or the liquidator or any creditor or contributoryof the company, may, if it thinks proper so to do, declare that any persons who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of thebusiness in manner aforesaid shall be personally responsible,without any limitation of liability, for all or any of the debts orother liabilities of the company as the court may direct&quot;,,(3)  &quot;Where any business of a company is carried on with such intentor for such purpose as is mentioned in subsection (l) of thissection, every person who was knowingly a. party to the carryingon of the business in manner aforesaid, shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term notexceeding two years or to a fine not exceeding  500 or to both&quot;.4.      In our opinion the position of the directors in relation to section332 cannot be considered independently of that of the Ministry,    liability under section 332 both civil and criminal^ extends to any person who is&quot;knowingly a party&quot; to the carrying on of the business of the company&quot;with intent to defraud creditors&quot;.    Such liability is not confined toofficers of the company? it extends, in our opinion, to any person who is party to the offence.    It is true that the section does not applyto the Crowiij but this would not in our opinion justify the Crown in doingthat which, If done by anyone else, would be an offence under the section,50      The word &quot;defraud&quot; in the section connotes &quot;actual dishonestyinvolving, according to current notions of &quot;six trading among commercialmen, real moral blame&quot;, so that, if a company continues to carry on business and to incur debts at a time when there is to the knowledge ofthose responsible for its affairs &quot;no reasonable prospect&quot; of the creditorsever receiving payment of those debts, it is, in general, &quot;a properinference&quot; that the business of the company is being carried on &quot;with intent to defraud&quot; those creditors    (per Ivlaugham J0 in Re William C.3-.eitch Brothers jbfcd^ 1932 Ch3 71, 77 and in Re Patricktand Lyon 1933Ch. 786,790), &quot; &quot;&quot;&apos;      &apos;60      La the present case, we understand that the Ministry had no reasonto doubt the company1 s solvency before October, 1969-    We have before us the minutes of a meeting held on 21st June, 1968,    This meeting appearsto have been concerned primarily with the size and purpose of the
Government&quot;s investment, in the company, hut the directors were warnedduring the course of it against undertaking a development programme whichwould render the company insolvent,,    The Ministry5 s position was merelythat of shareholder and creditor and it was under no duty (at all events tothe other creditors) to keep itself informed as to the company^ solvency.There can therefore, in our opinion, be no criticism of the Ministry&apos;conduct during this period,,7.      In October, 1969, however the Ministry were made aware that thecompany was insolvent, at all events unless the Government loans were treated as if they were share capital,.    With this knowledge, the Ministry,for six weeks, provided the company with cash for the. express and limitedpurpose of enabling it to continue trading without incurring a compulsoryliquidation at the instance of the creditors.    This would have beenindefensible had it not been for the Minister !s intention (evidenced,for example, in his letter to the Chief Secretary of 24th November,1969) to make available such funds as might eventually be necessaryto pay the creditors - for it is not suggested that the Ministry expected the company to become solvent as a result of such continued trading,or otherwise.    It was, we understand, the Ministry!s hope that, ifthe company continued to trade, it would be able to sell its business as a going concern and thereby realise more from it than it otherwisewouldp but the existence of such a hope would not, of itself, be anadequate answer to a ch&amp;s?ge of fraudulent trading,8C      It is against that background that the position of the directorsin relation to section 332 must be considered.    As regards the period before October, 1969? it may well be that their belief that the government loans could be treated as if they were share capital was misplaced,,    Butthere is no reason to doubt its genuineness,,    As regards the later period the directors were entitled to assume (despite the formal situation and despite the various disclaimers by officials in the Ministry of personalauthority to commit the Government) that the Government would in factsee the creditors paid, because otherwise, as we have pointed out, theGovernment1 s own actions would have been indefensible,,    We do not suggest that the directors necessarily examined section 332 and reasonedas we have done,,    But they were able to reach the same conclusion by reference to &quot;current notions of fair trading among commercial men&quot;.Moreover, that it was the correct conclusion was confirmed to themby what was said by the Paymaster General at the meeting held on13th October, 1969.    The subsequent correspondence shows that itwas in fact the conclusion that they reached.    In those circumstances we do not think that the directors could be held liable under section 332.9.      By the same token we are of opinion that, as a practical matter,the Government cannot now disclaim liability to the creditors of thecompany,,    Whether in fact the directors had authority express orostensible to pledge the Governments credit and whether, if so, theydid pledge it, seems to us immaterial,,    The crux is that the Government
could now resist the claims of creditors only by asserting in effect (andin disregard of the Minister?s Intention) that it had chosen to adopt acourse which, if adopted by anyone else, would have rendered themliable, in a winding up of the company, for fraudulent trading,10o      We are asked to advise generally as to the principles that shouldguide the Ministry in other similar cases.    In our opinion., thefundamental principle is that the Ministry should never knowinglybe a party to an insolvent company continuing to carry on businessunless either (a) there is a reasonable prospect that by doing so, orby some other-means, it will become solvent again or (b) the ministry is satisfied that such funds as may be needed to pay the creditors willbe available from its own resources or otherwise.    One solution, whereit is desired to give Government assistance for the carrying on of a business that is owned by an insolvent company, will be to form a new company to buy the business free from the liabilities of the old company,ensuring that the new company!s share capital is sufficient to give it areasonable prospect of remaining solvent.    The special circumstancesof particular cases may suggest othei solutions, e, g, a scheme ofarrangement under section 206 of the Act,
