, DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(70) 23 COPY NO,    O 010th february,  1970CABINETPAY OF SCHOOL TEACHERS IN ENGLAND AND wales memorandum by the Secretary o  State for Education, and ScienceAs foreshadowed in her oral report on 20th January(CC(70) 3rd Conclusions? Minute 2)2 the First Secretary of State and I net the  teachers^ panel of the Burnham Committee on 23rd January,    Weexerted every pressure and gave every possible assurance to persuade them to CO&quot;operate in arbitration,,    They maintained their refusal &quot;at thisstage&quot; and asked for further discussions in Burnham, on the ground that,if Incomes policy was as flexible as we had said (in the context of anarbitral award), the management ought to be able to raise their offer.2C      At the further Burnham meeting on 6th February the managementwant no further than to make open&apos;their without prejudice offer of  85overall.    When this was rejected, they again sought arbitration.    the teachers asked for further negotiation.    The chairman adjourned thecommittee until 13th February so that he could consider his own position.He will probably consult Department of Employment and Productivityofficials this week.    Unless the management take some Initiative, therewill be deadlock again next Friday,3,      There are strains within the teachers1 panel, but no real sign of weakening, either on the arbitration issue or on the total  135 Interimclaim for 1st April, 1970,   Area strikes, which, even on a small scale,would be more embarrassing to us than any so far, are planned afterhalf-term,,4,      The local authorities still think, by a majority, that an increase inthe  85 offer will, if large, be more than they can afford and, if small,fail to produce agreement - and, either way, be construed as weakness inthe face of pressure.    They do not expect the teachers to change theirmind, for the present at least, about arbitration.    They therefore thinkthat the way out may lie in bringing forward the effective dace of therestructuring and comparability settlement, hitherto envisaged as1st April, 1971,    There will be further discussions before I3th Februaryin the management paneL bus at present there are two variants under study,-If.
Under variant At which only some of  tie local authority associationssupport, there would be an interim settlement, for 1st April, 1970, either by agreement at  85 overall or by arbitration., no doubt at a somewhat higher figure (?  100)a and a full scale new settlement fromlst January, 197LUnder variant B there would be no increase at all this April, but therestructuring would take effect on 1st October? 197C    The local authoritiesare likely greatly to prefer variant B9 which, by putting the restructuringon a base not pushed up by any interim Increase,, would both cost lessafter 1970^71 and give greater scope for the much needed restructuring.5.      A worthwhile restructuring and comparability operation might cost,at a guess0 something like 15 per cent in all.    Both variants would give the teachers more hi 1970^71 than they would get from the  85 for this Aprilwhich we have so far fixed as our limit? but neither variant involves raising the  85 offer as such.    Staging would, I think9 be almost impossible.    i cannot yet make an accurate costing, but in cash terms variant A might cost  54 million in 1970*71 and variant B  42 million, against 27.5 million for the present offer and  44 million for the teachers1  135claim.    But there would be no further increase,, as hitherto envisaged,, inApril, 197.1 and all the increase would go on restructuring, so usingresources much more effectively than by dissipating thern on an interimsettlements    It is true that A would involve a marginal breach of the twelve months rule, but it could be presented as a staged package, andthere are recent precedents for worse breaches in the local authority field.Though the teachers1&apos; panel have so far insisted that they want the interimclaim settled firsts I know that some at least of them would be interested invariants A or B.    The local authorities are likely to be ready to put Bforward on 13th February, but it is not certain, that the teachers will accept it.    They are heavily committed to their interim claim, and may not beprepared to wait a further six months or so even though B offers a betterprospect of a really improved structure if only they could see it.6,      Though the exact amount cannot be known in advance of negotiations,either of these variants would cost extra money, but might provide a way tobreak the deadlock without violence to incomes policy, loss of face on either side, or surrender to duress,    I cannot tell just how things will go, butquick decisions may be vital and I should like to seek my colleagues&quot;contingent agreement that my representatives on the management panel neednot object, on grounds of total cost (the only ground on which we can stand inBurnham), to either of these variants, if the local authorities, who have fcomeet nearly half the cost,, wish in the event to propose either or both ofthem to the teachers,7.      This brings me to the National Board for Prices and Incomes.    the reference, to which my colleagues have already agreed in. principle, is readyto be made at any time     If on 13th February the teachers stand pat on the interim claim and still refuse to co-operate over the restructurings I think we should make it at once! we would have the hacking of the managementpanel.    E on the other hand the teachers agree to variant A or B and to anearly start on a restructuring review in Bttrnham, we need not make the reference for the present.Department of Education and Science, W.1.10th February,, 1970 -2-
