$DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY?S GOVERNMENT)CilpJLli COPY NO. .24th February, 1970CABINETMISUSE OF DRUGS bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for phe Home 33epartmentThe Home Affairs Committee agreed on 29th January to a range ofpenalties which would be provided in the Misuse of Drugs Bill for the offences of possession and trafficking in controlled drugs0    The details are given in the annexes to this paper.    I should, however, be grateful for the views of the Cabinet on the political consequences of the variouscourses proposecl02C       Under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1965, which covers heroin,cocaine, morphine and cannabis, the two offences of possession andof trafficking have been dealt with, on the same basis and the samepenalty of ten years1 imprisonment, applies to each.    Under the Drugs(Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1964, which covers amphetamines, .LSD andother hallucinogens, possession is pu.nisha.ble by two years&apos; imprisonment;there is no separate offence of trafficking^    The Home AffairsCommittee has agreed, I think rightly, that the new Bill shoulddistinguish between the offences of possession and trafficking0It has also approved a division of drugs into three categories,with separate penalties for eacm    The effect of these changes would beS*i(a) The penalty for possession of heroin, cocaine, morphine,etc should be reduced from ten years to five, and for possessionof eannabis from ten years to three.(b) The penalty for trafficking in these drugs should be raised from tenyears to 14, and for trafficking in amphetamines, LSD and otherhallucinogens there should also be a penalty of 14 years0(c) The penalty for the possession of certain drugs, eB g0 injectableamphetamines, LSD and similar hallucinogens, should beincreased from two years to five.Certain other drugs, such as minor stimulants and tranquillisers,would also be brought under control for the first time, with penaltiesof  100 for possession, and five years imprisonment for trafficking.-1-
30      The. question arises whether, in making this distinction between three types of drug and three levels of penalty for each of the two offences,the right balance has been achieved in relation to public opinion on drug-taking generally and on eannabis in particular.    The Bill will be very severe on trafficking, which will cover unlawful production, supply,import or export of controlled drugs, and new offences of possessionwith intent to supply and permitting premises to be used for production or supply.    On the other hand the penalties for simple possession wouldbe completely recast, with those for LSD and ihjec table amphetaminesincreased,, but with a substantial reduction in that for heroin, cocaineand morphine and an even more substantial reduction in respect ofcannabis.    The proposals approved by the Home Affairs Committeeare thoroughly rational and can be presented as such, but my colleagues will be aware of the strong feeling which exists, particularly in relationto cannabis, which is perhaps the most widely publicised and certainly themost controversial of the drugs dealt with by the Bill,    I am anxious thatthe Government in presenting these essentially rational proposals shouldnot appear to be weakening in its attitude to the misuse of drugs,    I shouldbe grateful for my colleagues^ views on this.,4,      If my colleagues feel that there would be a great deal ofmisrepresentation or red sunder standing of these proposals thereare two alternative courses.    The first would preserve the three categories which have the merit of flexibility and have been well received in discussion with a w5.de range of Interested organisations,but would -(a) increase the penalty for possession of cannabic from three years to five, or even seven, and perhaps also(b) increase the penalty for possession of heroiny cocaine, morphine,etc, from five years to seven,.,compared with ten years at present,50       The second approach would be to abandon the distinction betweencategories of drugs altogether and provide a single maximum penalty forpossession, and a single maximum penalty for trafficking.    Possiblemaximum penalties for possession would then be either ten years orseven years;  or perhaps differentia.! penalties - say five and seven years - fcr first and subsequent offencesa    Under this approach themaximum penalty for trafficking would be 14 years in all cases,60      I should welcome the views of my colleagues.    My own view is that the preferable course would be to abandon the three categories of drug and to provide a single maximum penalty of seven years&apos;imprisonment for possession and 14 years for trafficking, recognising that these are maximum penalties and that the courts would usually inflicta much smaller penalty for possession if not for trafficking,Ijo j, C,Home Office, Sa\&apos;Tal024th February. 1970
