NURSES&apos;  pay memorandum by  the  Secretary of  State   for Social   services on  31  December  1969 (PI(69)281h Meeting,  Minute  1)   the  committee agreed   to a 24.5  per  cent   increase     in Nurses&apos;   Pay,   in a  two yearsettlement  with payment   of   16.2  per   cent   ( 46.2  million)   on  1  Apr:1970 and  a   further  8.3 per  cent   ( 23.6 million)   on   1  April   1971.The Staff  Side had  claimed an  immediate.increase  of  nearly  30 percent  and   there were claims  for   shorter  hours   and   increasedspecial  duty  payments   in   the offing.       I  had myself   thought   thatthere was   justification   for meeting  the  claim in  full,   in  viewof   the  present   crisis   in nursing  and   the  very  special   factors which  justified an  exceptional   increase under  incomes  policy(see PI(69)86).2.      The Management Side  of  the &quot;Whitley Council  made on13 January  an   initial   offer of   15.3  per   cent   and  7.7  per  cent.After   two  further meetings,   at   the   second  of  which,   with  thethe  agreement  of   the  Chancellor  and   the  First   Secretary,   thesecond   stage  offer was   increased   to  9.2  per   cent   and wi 1 1 ingnessexpressed  to   submit   the   second   stage   to  arbitration   if   the  staff side  desired   that  when  the   time  came,   the   offer  has  beendecisively rejected,   and   it   is  clear  that  no  settlement   ispossible within   the  limits  approved  by  the Committee.3.       The Staff  Side are  reluctant   to bind   themselves   to a   two year agreement  because  of   uncertainty  about  wage movements  and   future economic  conditions;     and   they   insist   that   the  whole of   theincrease offered  should be given   in  1970.      A formal   breakdown of  negotiations  has only  been  averted  by   suggesting  an adjournment of  a week to  consider how  to break  the deadlock.4.       I  remain  of   the  view,   expressed in PI (69)86   that  we  cannot afford  to   let  negotiations break down.       This would  be disastrous   to  the  Service&apos;-and  the Government.       I   think asettlement  might  be  secured on the  basis  of  the amounts  already offered   if   we brought   the   second   stage   forward   into   1970.Almost certainly  if   it were brought   forward  to  1  October,   justpossibly   if   it  were  paid on  1   December.       This  would meanincreasing   the  cost   in  the  first  year by   11.8 million or 7.9 million.       It   would  offend against   the   twelve months  ruleJL .
and  would  be  repugnant   to  the majority  of   the Management  Side,but   it  might   be   the more attractive  solution  to  the Staff  Sidebecause  of   their public commitment  to get  the whole  increase   in1970. ...5.      The alternative is a one  year  settlement  at  a  figure  shortthe  total   offered  for  the  two years but  well  above what  ha s  so fbeen offered   for   the  first   year.       The minimum  increase whichcould reasonably be  expected  to secure a  settlement  on this basiwould be 20 per cent,   at  a cost   of   57  million,   to run for  oneyear .6. I hope the Committee will agree that a breakdown must he avoidedand I invite them to authorise a one year increase of 20 per cent.     Ifthis should not he acceptable to the Staff Side I should like to have authority for an 18-month agreement of the size already offered hut with-.  &apos;the second stage payable on 1 October 1570.R H S department  of Health and Social  SecurityAlexander Fleming HouseElephant  and CastleLondon SE110 February   197 0
