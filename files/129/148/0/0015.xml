Chapter IINTRODUCTION1. This White Paper sets out the Governments revised proposalsfor the reorganisation of local government in the geographical counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire,2. This area consists of the two administrative counties ofGlamorgan and Monmouthshire, the four county boroughs of.Cardiff,Swansea, Newport and Merthyr Tydfil, and forty seven non-county boroughs and districts.     The White Paper &apos;Local Government in Wales&apos; published in July 1967 (Cmnd. 3340) proposed reorganisation into two administrativecounties, three county boroughs and fifteen new districts,3, These proposals were subsequently the subject of extensiveconsultations by the Government with the local authorities and theirassociations.    All concerned were also given the opportunity to commentfurther on them following the publication of the Report of the RoyalCommission on Local Government in England (Cmnd. AOAO) in June 19^9*4. In the light of these consultations, and having regard alsoto the view of the Royal Commissions on Local Government in Englandand Scotland* that the division between town and country ought to beended for local government purposes, the Secretary of State for Y/alesdecided in October 19^9 to make a further review of the situation inSouth Wales,     The purpose of the review was to see if a satisfactorypattern of local government could be worked out in Glamorgan and monmouthshire which would avoid the division between county boroughs and administrative counties contained in the White Paper/ proposals,5c The results of this review and the conclusions which theGovernment draw from it are described below.     It is emphasised thatthese conclusions relate solely to the geographical,counties ofGlamorgan and Monmouthshire,     In the rest of Wales, i,e, in the othereleven counties, where there are no county boroughs, the government propose that local government shall be reorganised on a two-tier basis*Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland 1966-69?

involving the amalgamation of the present eleven counties.into four(Clwyd, Gwynedd, Powys and Dyfed) and the present 117 non-county boroughs and districts into twenty districts.    This, with certain modifications,is in line with what &apos;Local Government in Wales&apos;* proposed for the areaof Wales outside Glamorgan and Monmouthshire.6, The first stage of the present review was a socio-geographicstudy to establish the facts about where people live, work, shop and use their leisure.     Nest, the relevance of these facts to the structure of local government was examined.     It was then possible to judge whichpattern of local government seemed most likely to fit the pattern of daily living and to provide services of the standards required.*Cmnd. 33402.
Chapter IISOCIAL AND GEOGRAPHIC STUDY OP THE REVIEW AREA7. This examined the geographic structure of the area and its effect on the location of communities and communications, journey towork movements, the relative importance of towns as providers of services, the distribution and future trends of population and employment,and administrative arrangements for local government and other public services.     The study was carried out in considerable detail, its aimbeing to elucidate the major relationships between communities deriving from the pattern of social and economic life.     This gives the mostreliable guide to the areas over which the major local authority services need to be provided.    An extremely condensed summary of theconclusions under the main headings is given in the succeeding paragraphs.Geography8. With the exception of the coastal plain and eastern parts ofMonmouthshire, the review area consists of an elevated plateau, underwhich lies most of the South Wales coalfield, dissected by narrowsteep-sided valleys running roughly north to south.     These geographicfactors have helped to produce the three main characteristics of muchof the review area;(i)   there are strong social and economic links along eachvalley and extending to the coast.     Road and rail networks follow thispattern connecting the valleys to the ports, three of which - Cardiff,Newport and Swansea - have become the chief towns$(ii)   communication between neighbouring valleys has beenhindered by the terrain.     The Heads of the Valleys road (A 465) has improved east to west communications between the northern parts of manyof the valleys.    Nevertheless, the natural pattern of movement is between the valleys and the coastal plain and the main east to westcommunications by road and rail have in the past and will in the futurefollow the plainj(iii)   the narrowness of the valleys has resulted in congestion and limited room for development with the result that most of themoontain elongated settlements without major commercial oentres.Movement patterns9. While a local government area cannot be completelyself-sufficient in the sense of providing jobs for all its residents, a3.
situation in which many people live in one local authority area and workin another discourages interest in local government and makes it moredifficult to administer planning, transportation and other majorservices,     The responsibility for these services ought to be, wherever possible, that of an authority for an area covering both the places where people live and the places where they work,10, Table I below shows the main travel to work patterns in thearea as derived from the 1^66 sample census.     There were eleven centres in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire to which more than five thousand workerstravelled daily from a different local authority area.     Of these5Cardiff, Newport, Port Talbot, Pontypridd and Swansea emerge as the centres with the largest daily inward movements of workers./See also Map \J.Table IInflows and outflows of workers to and from all towns in the review area with over 25*000 population or a large inflow of workersin 1966.Local authority	I       Inflow	OutflowCardiff CB	37*790	8,020Merthyr Tydfil CB	i        2*840	% 200Swansea CB	11*420	11,920Aberdare UP	3*210	7,230Barry MB	1*910 9,560	5,030Bridgend UD		1,930Caerphilly UD	5,740	7,740Gelligaer UD	4*110	5*510Mountain Ash UD	3*120	4*&apos;650Neath MB	7*430	4,340Pontypridd UD	12;250	5*630Port Talbot MB	13*680	2*830Rhondda MB	2*170	11*540Newport CB	18*300	6; 700Bedwellty UD	3,010      :	5*840Cwmbran UD	7*260	3*590Ebbw Vale UD	5*740      j	1 j320Pontypool UD	6,620	6,190Sources   Sample Census 1966sWorkplace and Transport Tables?Part IsTable 2.HMSO, 1968.4.
11, In the case.of four local authority areas, Bridgend, Pontypridd,Cwmbran and Pontypool, more than one-fifth of the resident working population travelled to work daily outside the area.12. At the other end of the scale were local authority areas wherethe daily outflow.was greater.than the daily inflow and among theseBhondda, Aberdare, Caerphilly, Gelligaer, Merthyr Tydfil and Barry were all areas from which more than five thousand workers each daytravelled to work.13* The initial conclusion from this analysis was that Cardiff,Newport, Port Talbot and Swansea were major travel to work centres ofth9 two counties,Extent of urban services1A, The scale and range of services, notably shopping facilities,provided in towns is a guide to their interdependence with neighbouringareas and to their social importance in relation to each other.     an analysis was made of the shopping characteristics of the major towns interms of sales of durable and convenience goods, of retail turnover,their spheres of influence as entertainment centres and by newspaperdistribution.

Between 1953 and 19^8 the proportion of total employment in service industry increased from thirty eight per cent to forty fourper cent,     A high proportion of this form of employment is in the5.

The study brought out clearly three groups of social andeconomic factors which are highly relevant to proposals for localgovernment reorganisations(i)   the close links between the towns and villages in eachvalley5   and between them and the coastal towns5,-(ii)   the great importance of Swansea, Newport and Cardiff ascentres of life in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire 1(iii)   the comparative absence of strong links, despite the heads of the Valleys Road, between the different valleys.6.
Chapter IIIFC68ILLE PATTERNS18,        A number of possible local government structures for Glamorganand Monmouthshire have been examined in the light of the analysissummarised in Chapter II.     In judging these various possibilities itis important to bear in mind what is required of the reorganised localgovernment.     First and foremost it must be able to meet the special needs and requirements of the area concerned.     It must enjoy theinterest and support of the communities it serves.     It must recognise the interdependence of town and country.     It must be efficient in the carrying out of its functions, and to this end areas must be. definedwhich will enable major services such as planning, transport, education,housing, community health and welfare to be provided on a coherent andeconomic basis.     The new system must also have an inherent strength in population and other terms and must not consist of small and weak units,19*        The question of the most satisfactory range of population for new local authority areas in South Wales is of.great importance to the objectives.     In judging alternative solutions, the present review hasborne in mind the range of population adopted for major authorities inother parts of Wales, and the criteria recommended by the RoyalCommission on Local Government in England^ and adopted by the Governmentin the White Paper 1 Reform of Local Government in england (Cmnd. 4276).The new county of Gwyne.dd would have a population of about 212,000,Dyfed would have about 318,000, and Clwyd 355,000. (Powys with a population of 116,000 would be an exceptionally sparsely inhabited area).It is these authorities which for the rest of Wales have been given a responsibility for all the main services.    The geographical counties ofGlamorgan and Monmouthshire are much more highly urbanised andindustrialised than in the remainder of Wales.     The criteria proposedby the Royal Commission and adopted by the Government for similar types of area in England are relevant to the situation in the two counties.These criteria are that an authority responsible for all local government functions should have a population of not much less than 250,000, andnot much more than a million.     These figures need to be set beside thetotal population of the review area which in 1969 was 1,722,000.*Cmnd. 40407.
CONFIDENTIAL20.        The basic choice for the area lies between a two-tier system oflooal government and a pattern of unitary authorities.     There is a prima facie attraction in adopting a tier pattern since this is what isalready proposed for all other parts of Wales.     But this turns verymuch on whether a tier pattern would be the best way of meeting thedesiderata discussed above.21.        In South Wales the only feasible alternative two-tier system tothat proposed in &apos;Local Government in Wales&apos;* would be a metropolitansystem on the lines proposed.for five areas of England in Reform ofLocal Government in england/.     The recommendation of the RoyalCommission on Looal Government in Scotland^that there should be a two-tier system in that country was based on a detailed study of thecircumstances of Scotland.     It v/ould not be appropriate to thesituation in South Wal^s and if adopted would create serious anomaliesvis-a-vis the functions carried out by the second-tier authorities inthe different parts of the Principality.     Equally unsatisfactory wouldbe a two-tier system in which the county boroughs became district councils of the kind envisaged in TLocal Government in wales withinthe administrative county structures of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire.If there were to be a tier system in South Wales it would have to be ametropolitan authority with a number of metropolitan districts under it.22.        The Government are clear that a metropolitan system should beadopted in preference to,a unitary system only where geographical andother factors make a two-tier pattern of this sort unavoidable.     Thequestion therefore is whether the circumstances in South Wales are such that a metropolitan system would provide more effective local governmentand substantially greater benefits in the major local government servicesthan would a system of unitary authorities.     The Government are notpersuaded that this is so,    No satisfactory case has emerged for setting up a metropolitan authority covering all or a major part ofGlamorgan and Monmouthshire.     If, for example, such an authority were set up covering the geographical county of Glamorgan it would beresponsible for the planning of both Swansea and Cardiff and the areassurrounding them.    The survey has shown that this would be neithernecessary nor desirable.    There is a viable planning region focussedon Cardiff and another focussed on Swansea.     They have common problems and interests which require consultation, but these are no more numerousor extensive than those which will affect most of the other proposedplanning authorities in England and Wales.*Cmnd. 3340ACmnd, 4276p cmnd.. 4150 8,CONFIDENTIAL
23,        In these circumstances there is no apparent necessity to create a metropolitan authority..    Indeed, such a course might well producesubstantial disadvantages, since the metropolitan authority, whatever its shape and size, would be disproportionately large in relation toall the other local authorities in Wales and would create an undesirableimbalance in the structure of Welsh local government as a whole.2if.        The evidence of the present review shows that an effectiveunitary pattern can be constructed for Glamorgan and Monmouthshirecontaining unitary authorities fully capable of discharging all thefunctions which would fall to a metropolitan authority.     (This unitarypattern is discussed in the following Chapter).     These authorities would effectively undertake the planning of land use and transport services and large house building programmes.     They would be ableeffectively to provide education and personal social services and would form good bases for the health services to be planned alongside them.9.
Chapter IVA UNITARY PATTERN25. Several possible unitary patterns for Glamorgan and monmouthshire have been considered.   In the course of the reviewa number of models were constructed, including a division ofGlamorgan and Monmouthshire into as many as six unitary authorities,the largest number at all compatible with the socio-geographicfacts and with the population criteria referred to in Chapter III(paragraph 19).26. Neither of the models comprising six or five unitaryauthorities offered a satisfactory pattern.   The first involved a division of Glamorgan into four authorities and Monmouthshire into two.   The second presupposed the creation of a heads of thevalleys authority including parts of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire,straddling some six valley communities and lacking any satisfactorycentre.   Both would have created weak authorities lacking cohesiveunity.27. A third model contained four unitary authorities, onecorresponding to the present geographical county of Monmouthshire,with some modifications in the present boundary with Glamorgan; theother three together comprising the present geographical county ofGlamorgan.    This pattern contained a mid-Glamorgan authority which,within the most acceptable boundaries which could be devised, wasweak from the point of view of population, containing little morethan 200,000 people.   Moreover, it lacked a satisfactory unifyingfocus or centre.   Bridgend was the most obvious candidate for this position, but, though a prosperous and growing town, it lackedthe size to be fully effective.   Various attempts at strengtheningthis unit by adding areas to the east and v/est failed to produce a result which was viable in the socio-geographic terms on which10.
the study rested.   On the contrary, they confirmed the inherentweakness of the unit.28. The only unitary pattern which was found to providea satisfactory socio-geographic basis was one consisting of threeunitary authorities, two in what is broadly the present geographiccounty of Glamorgan and one in what is largely the presentMonmouthshire.   This model proved to offer in many other ways asensible basis for reorganisation and is therefore assessed insome detail below.29.. The socio-geographic study shows that the social andeconomic links between communities run north to south, along the valleys and between the valleys and the coastal towns.   it also shows the importance of Cardiff, Newport and Swansea ascompared with other towns in the review area, in the fields ofemployment, shopping and other urban services.   A division of the review area into three units each containing one of these towns,therefore, offers a reasonable prospect of a satisfactory localgovernment structure.   The influence of each town is widespread.Indeed there is evidence of linkages between the most distantparts of the area and one or other of these towns or theirhinterlands.30. Newport, with the neighbouring steel works at Llanwera.and the new town of Cwmbran, acts as the major urban focus for most of Monmouthshire.    There are other employment centres, suchas Ebbw Vale, but none has the same standing in relation to therest of the county as has Newport.31. Cardiff, the capital city and biggest town in Vales,the headquarters of central government departments and of many other national bodies, exercises influence over most of east Glamorganand some of west Monmouthshire.   The analysis of journeys to workshows that the city and its immediate surroundings are a focusfor employment for a wide surrounding area including the Rhondda,Cynon, Taff, and Rhymney valleys.    It is a major shopping, commercial11.
and entertainment centre.   Despite the growth of new shoppingcentres in the smaller towns there is no reason to believethat its predominant position in these respects is likely to beupset.32. Swansea, with its recently redeveloped shopping and commercial centre, occupies a significant position in the west of Glamorgan.    The evidence of the social and geographicstudy shows that for main shopping and commercial purposes ithas influence as far east as Neath and Port Talbot.33* Thus a broad outline of three unitary areas is clear;the precise boundaries between them are less easy to define.In the following paragraphs a provisional solution is discussed.3^. In the east of the area, a combination of the presentcounty of Monmouthshire with the county borough of Newport tocreate one unitary authority would have the merit ofsimplicity and would accord broadly with the socio-geographicaffinities of the communities in the county.   But the presentboundary between Glamorgan and Monmouthshire was condemned bythe Local Government Commission for Wales and the results of thepresent study - though not pointing to the same conclusionas the Commission&apos;s - also cast doubt on its continuance.35* The doubtful area lies in the Rhymney valley where thecounty boundary, running along the river, splits communities.   TheCommission considered* that the administration of the valleyought to be unified, that a better boundary could be found to thewest of the river than to the east, and that such advantages asderived from ,.a transfer of territory should go to the weaker county,Monmouthshire.* Local Government Commission for Wales: Report and Proposalsfor Wales, paragraphs 635 &amp;nd 636: HMSO, 1963.12.
36. There is no doubt about the need for unification of theadministration of the valley.   But while the study confirms theCommission^ view that it would be difficult to find a suitableboundary to the east of the river, it also shows that in so faras communities in the valley have linkages with either Cardiffor Newport, those with Cardiff predominate.37. It is suggested therefore that the boundary line ought tofollow the eastern watershed of the Rhyraney valley as far aspracticable.   This could largely be achieved by the inclusion in the Cardiff unit of the urban districts of Rhymney and ofBedwas and Machen, and the wards of Aberbargoed, Cwmsyfiog,New Tredegar and Phillipstown in Bedwellty Urban District. Butthe Cefn Fforest/Fleur-cle-Lis area could not be split satisfactorilyin the same way.   For the present at any rate the anomaly of using the river boundary for this short section of J;he valleyseems preferable to making a new and equally arbitrary divisionof a built-up area.   Further south, there appears to be a good case for including with Cardiff the parish of St Mellons, nowin Magor and St Mellons Rural District.38. The boundary between east and west Glamorgan, betweenthe spheres of influence of Cardiff and Swansea, is also difficultto define.    In the north it is clear that if, as seems right,the whole of the Cynon valley is to form part of the easternunit, the parish of Rhigos in Neath Rural District, whereseveral thousand Aberdare people work, should come east.39. In the centre and the south Port Talbot, together withGlyncorrwg and other communities in the Afan and Corrwg valleyshas greater community of social and commercial interest with Swanseathan with Cardiff.    The boundary should therefore clearly be drawneast of Port Talbot and Glyncorrwg.   But how far east?   Many of theinhabitants of Bridgend and neighbouring valleys and towns workin Port Talbot which suggests the inclusion of Bridgend in the sameunitary area as that town.   But for shopping, entertainment, etc the inclination of Bridgend people is towards Cardiff rather thanSwansea.   Moreover Bridgend is a lesser centre, not only for the13.
neighbouring Ogwr, Garw, and Llynfi valleys, but also forparts of the Vale of Glamorgan which in any two-way divisionof Glamorgan would be associated with Cardiff.   Further, theprospect of employment growth in and east of Bridgend may reducethe relative importance of travel to work links with PortTalbot.   These considerations point to the inclusion in theeastern area of Bridgend and the communities for which it isa focus.40. This pattern, details of which are shown on Map 3*would therefore create three authorities:Swansea and West Glamorgan with a population of about372,000 and an area of roughly 201,000 acres.Cardiff and East Glamorgan with a population of about919,000 and an area of roughly 335,000 acres.Newport and Monmouthshire with a population of about^32,000 and an area of roughly 33^,000 acres.Each of the three areas would have an adequate population.    TheCardiff and East Glamorgan area would have more than the other two combined but each of the three authorities would have sufficientpopulation to manage their responsibilities effectively.   Thethree areas would be justified socio-geographically, would meet the population requirements, and would avoid too muchinterference with existing local government boundaries.14.
- Chapter VPROPOS :il,3The proposed pattern41. In this review the Government have examined a wide range of possible ways of ending the division between county boroughs and administrativecounties in South Wales.   So pattern will satisfy everyone.   The decision must be a judgement as to which pattern is most likely to be able to meet theneeds of the people of this part of Wales now and in the future.42. The Government consider that a system of unitary authorities ismore likely to achieve this purpose than any alternative.   Ho tier patternwhich has been examined, would, in the Government1s view be as satisfactory as the best of the unitary patterns.43. Within the unitary field a pattern of three unitary authorities is likely to be the one bast suited to the requirements of South Wales.The review has brought out the close links between the communities of thevalleys and those of the coastal plain; and the wide spheres of influence of Cardiff, Newport and Swansea on those communities.   It has further shown the practicability of creating three effective local authorities with one ofthese towns as the principal focus in each area.44&quot; Each of these areas would be a coherent socio-geographic unit1.A local authority responsible for- any one of them would have sufficientpopulation and resources to carry out effectively and economically its responsibilities for education and the other personal social services.   Itwould have control of a sufficiently wide area to be able to executecomprehensive planning and transportation policies.45* The Government therefore propose that local government in the geographical counties of Glamorgan and MonmcutiBhire should be reorganisedinto three areas based on Cardiff, Newport and Swansea.    These would beareas of single-tier local government similar to the unitary areas recommendedby the Bcyal Commission on Local Government in England and accepted for thatcountry in the white Paper&quot;Reform of Local Government in England&apos; (Cmnd 4276).Cardiff will of course remain the capital of Wales.46. The three unitary areas proposed are illustrated on Map 3*   There,is room for discussion as;toihe precise boundaries of these areas; and the mapis not intended to embody hard and fast proposals.   It is necessary that15.
the new boundaries should follow existing local authority administrativeboundaries, but subject to this, the CTOvernnent would wish to have full consultation with all concerned about the precise boundary lines.Community councilsarea there should be directly elected community councils with limitedexecutive functions but primarily intended as bodies to represent local opinion.   The areas to be covered by each council, their precise functions,&quot;and their relationship to the councils of the unitary areas are matters which the Government propose to discuss with the local authority associationsbefore formulating final proposals.Local dignities48. There are eleven boroughs within the review area, two of whichare also,-cities.   The Government are determined to devise generally acceptable arrangements which will preserve as many as possible of thedignities and privileges which go with the special status of each ofthese towns.   Again, they propose to discuss these questions with thelocal authority associations.   Any arrangements devised for boroughs inGlamorgan and Monmouthshire will of course have to accord with arrangementsfor boroughs in the rest of Tales.lames.49&apos; It will be necessary to find a generic title for unitary areas and their councils.   The Government would welcome views on these.   It willalso be necessary to name each one of the three unitary areas proposed.. Thedescriptive names used in this Tnite Paper are not intended to be final,and the Government would welcome suggestions before legislation is introduced.   For the names of the two Glamorgan authorities the Governmenthave no preference at present; for Newport and Monmouthshire they believethat the name&quot;Gwent1 would be generally acceptable.Staff50.. The Staff Commission proposed in paragraph 45 of the white paper of 1967* would be concerned with staffing problems in the reorganisedstructure of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire as well as in the rest of Wales.47-As in the rest of Wales, it is proposed that within each unitary* cmnd. 3340 &apos;16.
A,11-Wales Machinery51. Under these proposals the reorganised system of local governmentin South Wales will differ from that proposed for the eleven counties of wales outside Glamorgan and Monmouthshire.    This is because different circumstances call for different solutions.   But the principle underlyingreorganisation is the same.   It is that the new pattern of local governmentshould be the one best suited to the requirements of an area.   There need be no undue difficulties in operating the two systems side by side.52. The White Paper does not put forward any new proposals for thecreation of all-Wales machinery.   The Government consider that it would be premature to take decisions on this critical issue until the Commission onthe Constitution has made its report.   In the meantime the Welsh council which was formed in 1968 will continue its valuable work to which theGovernment attach great importance.    The Council&apos;s terms of referenceinclude the encouragement of co-operation between the local authorities.The Government will continue to look to it for advice on this as in othermatters.Finance and other matters of common interest-.&apos;.to England and Wales53. The thorough-going review of local government finance, includingcontrols by central government and &quot;ocal taxation, mentioned in Chapters Vand VI of the White Paper 1 Reform of Local Government in England&apos; (Ciand 4276)will cover both England and Wales.   Similarly, Wales would be covered by thesame kind of machinery for investigating complaints of maladministration inthe sphere of local government as is proposed for England (see Chapter VII of cmnd 4270).   As in England, the new Welsh authorities will be composed ofmembers directly elected by the people, and. will not include aldermen.Consideration of other constitutional matters such as electoral arrangements,the size of councils, disqualification for membership of local authorities,and the expenses of councillors will proceed in association with considerationof these issues in the Enjlish context.Police&apos;, ancl fire&apos; services54. At present there is one police force for the whole of the geographical county of Glamorgan and another for the geographical county of Monmouthshire.   The Government are clear that subdivision of the total17.
area into more than two police areas would be- undesirable and indeed would wish to examine in consultation with the authorities concerned whether thewhole ?.rea should be one police area.   Areas for the future operation ofthe fire service will be considered in the light of the recommendations ofthe Holroyd Committee, whose report is expected soon.Future action55* There will now be an opportunity for the local authorities inGlamorgan and Iloninouthshire, their associations, and the public in the twocounties to make their views about these proposals known to the Government.Consultations with local authorities and local authority associations willbe arranged where appropriate.56. The Government1s objective will be tc embody their proposals forGlamorgan and iVionmctrlhshire and for the other parts of Wales in comprehensivelegislation at the earliest practicable date.18.
