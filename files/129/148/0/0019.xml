DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S govern/IENT)C(70) 39 COPY NO.3rd March. 1970CABINETNON-INDUSTRIAL CIVIL SERVICE: CENTRAL PAY CLAIMMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal in my memorandum to the Ministerial Committee on Prices and incomes (PI) I made proposals for settling the recent claim by theNational Staff Side for a substantial central pay increase covering the great majority of the non-industrial Civil Service.    The background to this claim and the reasons why I thought it necessary to offer anincrease of up to 8 per cent from 1st April, 1970, are fully described in that memorandum, a copy of which is attached.2.      The majority of the Prices and Incomes Committee did not agreewith my proposals but were prepared to authorise increases of 5 per cent for those grades whose pay was last adjusted on 1st July, 1969, and^ per cent for those whose pay was last adjusted (ignoring staging)on 1st January, 1969.    In my view these offers bore no relationship to the realities&quot; of the situation as set out in the PI paper and, had we put them forward, would have had the most unfortunate consequences,I therefore reserved my position in order to put to my Cabinet colleagues the crucial issues which seem to me to be at stake for both the CivilService and the Government.The Civil Service situation.      I have tried to explain in paragraphs 4-7 of the attached memorandum why the Civil Service is so deeply dissatisfied aboutpay and what the consequences are likely to be if we fail to settle thepresent claim by negotiation.    The situation may be summed up asfollows:-(i) The Staff Side have repeatedly and solemnly asserted (and have emphasised to me personally) that disillusionment with the way the CivilService pay system has been applied in recent years has grownalarmingly; and that there is mounting pressure to break out ofit and to use the power of the Civil Service to exact by militant actionwhat cannot be won within the system because the Government, by itsinsistence on staging pay research increases in breach of the 1967 pay agreement, has not allowed it to operate freely in spite of the fact that-1-
by definition Civil Service pay based on pay research must always lagbehind.    The main source of resentment is the feeling that there hasbeen deliberate discrimination against civil servants as compared withother more militant groups.    These feelings threaten the whole vThitleysystem and the willingness of the Staff Side to co-operate in anything fromefficiency measures to Fulton changes.(ii) We do not have to take tha word of the Staff Side leadership (although I fully believe they are sincere and in varying degrees deplore the situationwhich they are no longer confident of controlling).    There is ample direct evidence, e. g. the proceedings of staff association conferences,correspondence in staff journals, official declarations by some staff associations in favour of militant policies, threats of industrial action and actual instances of it on an unprecedented and growing scale,    T7eare rapidly approaching, if we have not already reached, a parting ofthe ways; if militant action is once started on a serious scale we shallhave embarked on a course which will involve settling pay disputes in theCivil Service by means of the use of industrial power rather than by theprocess of reasoned argument.(iii) It may be argued that the risk of 1 industrialising&apos; in this way theCivil Service must be taken; or even that the preservation of responsibleand restrained trade union leadership and policies in the Civil Service isnot of first importance.    To those who may think this I must make plain that the Civil Service can by selective industrial action far short of alarge-scale withdrawal of labour bring essential Government work to ahalt.   At very little cost to the Staff Side, the tax work of the InlandRevenue could be paralysed in vital areas, social service payments in local offices obstructed or prevented, tfivil airports closed by the cessation of air traffic control and the essential processes of centralgovernment gravely impeded,    I cannot of course assert that such action will be taken in any given set of circumstances,    I can only report that theNational Staff Side have told me that it is very likely to occur if no reasonable offer is forthcoming.   And I must emphasise that we havealready had a foretaste of it i, e, the overtime ban by Inland Revenuestaff which so affected the backlog of tax queries that we were obligedto give the unprecedented undertaking (which I myself would very muchhave preferred not to give) to backdate tho future outcome of an overtimeclaim.    The actions which the Staff Side could take v/ould be extremelydamaging and I doubt very much whether v/e should be prepared or ableto stand firm in the face of them.    And to capitulate after such a confron-tation would in my view be a disaster.The Claim; Amount4.      Although the situation is serious I certainly do not wish to reach asettlement regardless of cost; nor at the moment do I think we need to.While there is no possibility of getting a settlement on the basis proposedin the Prices and Incomes Committee I believe that it would be possible todo so within the limits of my own proposal which would be consistent with
the Civil Service pay system and, so far as the amount is concerned, wouldnot appear large in relation to many other settlements recently concluded in both the public and private sectors.    The Staff Side claim is based on theextent to which the pay of the main Civil Service classes has fallen behindsince it was last brought up to the appropriate fair comparison levels on1st January, 1968.    In assessing this, they would not accept that the 5 percent referred to in the Prices and Incomes Committee, by which the wagesindex has increased since 1st July, 1969, is relevant.    In the eyes of theStaff Side the relevant fact is that between the end of December, 1967, andthe end of January, 1970, the wages index rose by 13, 8 per cent while theCivil Service rates of the group concerned were increased by 5 per cent(the central pay increase of July, 1969) - a lag of 8. 8 per cent.    While I certainly do not regard the wages index as an acceptable yardstick, itcannot in the present situation be ignored.    By the end of March the &quot;lag&quot;may well have grown to lO-lO^- per cent.    Despite this I would hope to beable to settle for 8 per cent and just possibly for only 7 per cent.    Thesefigures have no logical justification.    They emerge from a number of considerations - the rate of wages grov/th, the example of recentsettlements (including particularly the Post Office), the negotiatingrealities and the importance of avoiding failure.    I assure my colleagues that we shall drive the hardest bargain we can within these limits - for civil Service as well as cost and incomes policy reasons,5,      The suggestion made by the Prices and Incomes Committee thatthere should be differential increases based on the White Paper range and on the period of time since the last pay adjustment is quiteunrealistic on two counts.    It produces far too modest an offer;but it would also have the effect of giving bigger increases to thosegrades whose pay was last brought into line by fair comparisons on1st January, 1969, than tothose whose pay was so adjusted on 1st January,1968,    We clearly cannot offer less to the much larger group of staffwhose pay, in spite of the central pay increase of last July, has fallenfarthest behind.    But there is, a case for giving the former group a smallerincrease than the others and I would seek to achieve this within an overallnegotiating authority of 8 per cent from 1st April, 1970,ThejDlaim: Operative Date6,      In the discussion at the Prices and Incomes Committee great stresswas laid on the importance for incomes policy, particularly in relation tothe private sector, of preserving the 12 months&apos; rule which, for the greatmajority of the staff covered by the claim, would rule out any operative date earlier than 1st July, 1970,    I do not for a moment question theimportance to incomes policy of trying to restore to this rule the authorityit had prior to the recent pay offers to Post Office and local authoritystaff; but there are on the other hand very strong arguments of anotherkind against waiting until July:-
(i)  It would not be possible to put the claim on one side and resume negotiations in, say, May or June,    The Staff Side would not accept sucha proposal and if we tried to press it the situation would get out of controlvery quickly with the consequences I have described,(ii) It would therefore be necessary to reach agreement now asettlement to take effect three to four months hence (assuming thatthe Staff Side were prepared anyway to forgo an increase until then).They would insist on increasing the amount to take account of likelymovements in the wages index between now and 1st July and would hardly be content with less than one percentage point a month.    They would nodoubt expect to get something over and above this to compensate for the deferment as such.    If I am right in my belief that we could probablysettle for 7-8 per cent from 1st April, 1970, if we offer it quickly, then the price of deferring the operative date by three months to 1st July might easily raise the cost of the settlement to 12 per cent or more,(iii) A settlement of this order could well be more expensive in 1970man one which operated from 1st April, 1970, It v/ould by its very sizebe entirely alien to the Civil Service pay system and make it very difficultto return to sanity in our future pay arrangements.    It would be damaging to incomes policy to base so large an increase on general wages movementsrather than on close functional comparisons.    It would even involve the riskof overpaying the Civil Service in relation to the pay research surveys due on 1st January, 1971.    For these reasons there could hardly be a moreunfortunate outcome for the Civil Service (and arguably for incomes policy)than a 1st July settlement - except a complete breakdown of negotiations.conclusion.       We are therefore faced with a most difficult choice and it is vital that we make the right one.    For the reasons I have given I must stronglyurge my colleagues to agree to my proposal of a more modest offer totake early effect; and in detail to authorise me to seek a negotiated settlement within the limits of an increase of 8 per cent from 1st April,1970, for all eligible grades (if possible with a smaller increase ior those whose pay v/as adjusted by pay research on 1st January, 1969),    In addition,for the reasons given in my PI paper, we should confirm our proposal toadopt a two-year pay research cycle, and accept that in the interests of getting back into phase the next central pay settlement should take effect from 1st January, 1971.S.Civil Service Department, S.W.1.2nd March, 1970
MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON PRICES AND INCOMESNON-INDUSTRIAL CIVIL SERVICE: CENTRAL PAY CLAIMMemorandum by the Lord Privy SealIntroductionIn the course of our discussions on the recent Post Office pay settlement I told my colleagues that we could expect an earlyclaim from the Civil Service National Staff Side for a substantialpay increase for the non-industrial Civil Service.    This has nowbeen lodged and, as expected, refers directly to recent events inthe Post Office.background.     In the non-industrial Civil Service pay is determined inaccordance with principles stemming from the recommendations of theRoyal Commission on the Civil Service 1953-55 (the PriestleyCommission) as embodied and supplemented in later agreements between the Official and Staff Sides of the National whitley council.    Briefly, these principles accept that the primary factor in determining pay in the non-industrial Civil Service should bea &quot;fair comparison&quot; with the rates paid for broadly comparablework outside the Civil Service after taking into account differ-ences in other conditions of service.   For the main classes of theCivil Service the facts necessary to establish fair comparison are obtained by the Civil Service Pay Research Unit set up in 1956which at present surveys nearly all these classes every threeyears.    Its procedures are extremely thorough and it is widely recognised as being the most effective body of its kind in thecountry (and perhaps anywhere).   After examining the nature of thework inside the Civil Service the Unit seeks functional analoguesin outside employment and reports the facts about their pay andconditions of service.   This provides the data from which theOfficial and Staff Sides negotiate a new rate for the Civil Servicejob around the median of the rates ft*r the outside jobs.   Thegreat majority of grades not covered by pay research surveys have their pay determined by means of pay links with other grades of comparable responsibility which have pay research.3.     In addition to pay reviews based on the work of the pay research Unit it has become accepted practice W award interimincreases in pay to ensure that the. pj..y of civil servants doeenot lag too far behind outside rates of pay during the interval
betvi/een pay research surveys.   The need for interim settlementsof this kind was recognised toy the Priestley Commission.Recent Pay Historyk.     In 196U the Official and Staff Sides entered into a 3-year agreement which provided for central pay increases of 3 per centon 1 January 196/4, 3i per cent on 1 January 1965 and 3^ per centon 1 January 1966.    In practice outside rates of pay moved muchmore rapidly over this period, and in the context of the h-yearlypay research cycle then in force, Civil Service rates fellmarkedly behind those in outside employment though the Staff Side,nonetheless, stood by the I96I4 central pay agreement.   They showedtoo a recognition of the requirements of incomes policy in its early years and accepted the 1966/67 &quot;standstill&quot; because it wasnation-wide.   But the subsequent application in 1968 and 1969 ofstaging to Civil Service pay was bitterly resented.   This was because staging was applied after a period in which, as I have said, Civil Service rates had fallen well behind pay in comparableemployment outside the Service, partly as a result of the modestlevel of central pay increases provided for in the I96I4 agreement and partly because tf the long time lag between pay researchsettlements.   The decision to stage Civil Service pay increasesdid in fact represent a unilateral breach by the Official Side ofthe 196/4 and the 1967 Civil Service Pay Agreements.   The staff side rightly claimed that the very size of the pay researchsettlements (which were designed to bring Civil Service pay into line, not with the highest, tout with the average level of pay foe comparable outside work) demonstrated how far Civil Service payhad fallen behind.   The decision to stage these pay increasesmeant that pay in the Civil Service remained behind outside ratesas these were themselves being improved through fresh increases in pay.   Furthermore the effect of staging was to reduce the pension entitlement of those near to retirement since Civil service pensions are calculated toy reference to the average pay of anofficer in his last three years of service.   This was particularlyresented because its effects were permanent.5.     It is true that during this period there were suggestions insome quarters that civil servants were in fact toeing preferentiallytreated because in some cases the second stage of staged increasesexceeded the 32 per cent annual ceiling.   But, as I have pointedout, the size of the increases arose as a result of the built intime-lag in the Civil Service pay system and the rate of growth in incomes generally; and because of staging, they did not bringCivil Service rates even temporarily into line with comparableoutside rates.THE PRESENT MOOD6.     For all these reasons the National Staff Side and staff associations have become increasingly disillusioned toy what theystrongly believe to be the discriminatory treatment of the public services by comparison with the nationalised industries and theprivate sector.   As a result, we how have on our hands a crisis mfconfidence and trust in the goed intentions of the Government over
the operation of the Civil Service pay system in which there still remains, however, a basic, although diminishing, faith.    Thepresent Staff Side leaders are coming under increasingly severepressure from their members to abandon their long standing policyof co-operation with the Official Side in management matters.There has been markedly less willingness to take part in measuresto improve efficiency in which the Staff Associations have hithertoreadily co-operated.   There is also a very real risk that progress with structural reform following the Pulton Report could be placedin jeopardy by a policy of non-cooperation on the Staff Side.The present more responsible leaders see a real threat to theircontinuing authority in the face of a rising tide of militancyamong their members.   Already militancy is the declared policyof more than one Staff Association representing lower paid staff;in recent months there has been an unprecedented number of threats of industrial action within the Service including the pressurebrought to bear by overtime bans in the Inland Revenue in supportof the National Staff Side claim for revised overtime rates \whichis currently under consideration).   There has also been strong pressure *n the leadership of the Society of Civil Servants(representing the Executive Classes) to adopt a militant policy.This has shown itself in a number of ways,  including the demandfor special out-of-turn measures to improve the pay of executive officers which we have been resisting as being inconsistent withthe Civil Service pay system.   The growth of militancy has been encouraged by recent events inside and outside the Service which seem to show that militancy always pays.7.     Because of the cc-operative attitude in the past of theCivil Service Staff Associations we do not perhaps adequatelyrealise the value of the gowd relations between management and staff which Government has enjoyed.    The non-industrial CivilService is involved in every part of the country with every facetof its life and work.    If we create the conditions for militancyto flourish the consequences could be both damaging and farreaching.8.     This is the background against which we must approach thepresent claim,    I do not suggest that we should :ibuy off&quot; the threat of militancy by means wf an inflated settlement.   But Iam convinced that we must reach a central pay settlement for thenen-industrial Civil Service which would be regarded as just and equitable against the pattern of recent pay settlements andwhich will give the Staff Side no legitimate grounds for claiming that the Government is discriminating against its own employees.The Staff Side Claim9.     While the Staff Side have lodged a claim for &quot;an immediate and substantial central pay settlement which is demonstrably fair to the Civil Service&quot;, they have not specified a particular per-centage increase or indicated the date from which, in their view,it should operate.   The leadership of the Staff Side is, I am sure, aware of the risks involved in their becoming committed twa particular figure.    But if a figure had been indicated it would,without question, have been a sizeable one.   The claim refers to
&quot;&quot;the immense pressure now being exerted upon Staff Associationleaders who are under challenge to demonstrate that our negotia-ting systdm can yield the kind of results which have been receivedelsewhere by more militant methods&quot;.   The claim refers to theindex of wage rates which at the end of 1969 showed a rise of almost 13 per cent since the operative date of the last pay researchsettlement for the Clerical,, Executive and Administrative classeson 1 January 1968 (and to the rise in the index of average earnings of approximately 17 per cent since 1 January 1968).   The claimsuggests that impending changes in the index of wage rates willindicate a further marked upward trend.    It points out that, in contrast, the Civil Service grades to which it refers havereceived an increase of only 5 per cent at 1 July 1969 an^ (&quot;:rawsattention to the recent Post Office settlement (in which staffwith an identical pay history have been offered an increase with effect from 1 January 1970 of about 8.5 per cent but are still holding out for more).    The Staff Side ask against this backgroundfor a central pay settlement which is &quot;realistically related towhat is happening in the community generally.&quot;Categories cf Staff Concerned10.    On the basis of their past pay history the non-industrial civil Service can be divided into three broad categories:-(a) Grades whose last pay research settlement took effecton 1 January 1968 (with a second stage of the settlementpaid on 1 January 19-69) and who received a 5 per centcentral pay increase on 1 July 1969.   This group, which include the general service Clerical, Executive andAdministrative Classes, numbers about 320,000.   An increasein their rates of pay of 1 per cent would cost  k^ million in a full year.(b) Grades whose last pay research settlement towk effect on1 January 1969 (with a second stage wf the settlement paid*m 1 January 1970) and who therefore did not benefit fromthe central pay increase on 1 July 1969.   This group includes the Works Group and other technical classes and numbersabout 80,000.   The cost of an increase in their rates of pay of 1 per cent would be  1^ million in a full year.(c) Grades whose last pay research settlement took effecton 1 July 1966 or 1 July 19&amp;7 (deferred from 1 January 1966and 1 January 1967 respectively because of the incomesstandstill).   This group, which includes messengers,  typists,machine grades, cleaners and process and general supervisorygrades, numbers about 60,000.   These grades have been thesubject of a pay research survey during the course of 1969and negotiations are currently in progress for a pay researchsettlement to be effective from 1 January 1970 for themand for grades linked to them for pay purposes.11. The Assistant Secretary, Under Secretary (and related grades)are eligible for central pay settlements and the Pl*wden Committeehas to be consulted about the application to thera of a central
pay increase.    This is relevant to the decision we shalleventually have to take on the implementation of the balance of the pay increases for the Higher civil Service recommended last yearby the Plowden Committee (on which I hope to submit proposals tomy colleagues shortly). In the meantime this consideration neednot affect our decision on a suitable central pay offer.Approach, to the Claim12.    In my memorandum Pl(SC)(69)71, which dealt with the arrange-ments for pay negotiation in the non-industrial Civil Service,  I proposed that the Staff Side should be offered a change from thepresent three year to a twojyear pay research cycle (if thisprove. 1 technically feasible), conditional upjn the conclusion ofa satisfactory agreement for the regulation of future central pay increases.    I also pointed out that the dates of pay research and central pay settlements have become out of phase in the course of applying the policies of standstill and severe restraint; this hasresulted in technical breaches of the 12 months rule to avoid agap of 1 8 months between pay increases.    I suggested that itwould be desirable to arrange for a return to a common date of1 January for both pay research reviews and central pay increases, although this might have to be achieved gradually andgroup by group according to the position of each group in the pay research cycle.13.    In normal circumstances I would therefore be suggesting theconclusion of an agreement governing central pay for at least1970 and 1971 coupled with a reduction in the pay research cyclefrom 3 to 2 years.    I would have expected the agreement to providefor increases of modest proportions in line with incomes pwlicyand to preserve the concept that central pay represents a &quot;toppingup&quot; to alleviate rather than fully to rectify the extent to whichCivil Service pay has fallen behind outside rates.   The agreement would also have provided f**r a return to a 1 January date forcentral pay, either on the group by group basis suggested in myearlier memorandum or possibly in two steps,  ie by operativedates of 1 April 1970 and 1 January 1971.1h.   But we now face a very different situation in which anagreement on these lines could not possibly form the basis of a negotiated settlement.   We are faced with the choice of goingwell beyond this or of failing to secure agreement and accepting the consequences which would flow from this,    we have to take into account the level of settlements which have been concededelsewhere in the public and in the private sector and, as Iwarned my colleagues earlier, the Staff Side regard the recentPost Office offers as particularly relevant to their case.These involve a real (and not a technical) breach of the 12 monthsrule (which has been eroded by other recent settlements) andconcede with effect from 1 January 1970 a pay increase of about.5 per cent to Post Office grades whose pay history and paysituation is identical with that of the Civil service grades inthe category set out in paragraph 10(a) above.   Not merely is there an identity of pay history but there is a large element ofcommon membership between the Post Office and Civil Service grades5sums?
in the Civil and Public Services Association and the Society ofCivil Servants.    The extent that the pay increases given to postOffice grades analogous with those in the Civil Service group at paragraph 10(c) above were higher than Civil Service pay researchevidence would appear to justify will increase our difficultiesin reaching satisfactory pay settlements for those grades coveredby the current pay research negotiations.   But we would not regard them as eligible for a central pay increase as such in the sameyear as a pay research settlement.   The Staff Ride will be aware that the post Office has yet to reach a settlement with the PostOffice Engineering Union for Post Office grades which are analogous to the Civil Service grades in paragraph 10(b) above, and that theUnion has indicated their intention of pressing for a very sizeablesettlement indeed (for which the highest level of increasesconceded in the receiit Post Office settlement will no doubt be their starting point).15.    It is true that we can argue that the Post Office managementhad a legitimate desire to ensure that all its grades moved to acommon review date.   But wg have already accepted this as an objective for the Civil Service.    The acceptance of a settlement which combines &apos;:new style&quot; Corporation treatment in respect bothof of its operative date and the way in which weak productivityarguments have been added to those of generalised comparability toproduce an inflated settlement (to be paid for at least in partby increases in Post Office charges) have necessarily led theStaff Side to assume that there can be no incomes policy objectionto a generous and early central pay increase for eligible CivilService grades.16.    I do not suggest that the Post Office and the Civil Servicemust be treated alike; this would not suit either the Civil service pay system t*r the Civil Service situation.   But the Post Officesettlement has made it impossible for rne to argue that the 1 2months rule and the White Paper range of 2-g% to        must beapplied to the Civil Service in present circumstances&quot;.&apos;   &quot;in anycase, while the Staff Side naturally see particular relevance inthe Post Office settlement since its employees used to be classi-fied as non-industrial civil servants, they will not havedisregarded the pay settlements which have taken place else wherein the public and private sector in the last few months, and,particularly where these cases have been won through militantaction, will have drawn appropriate conclusions.17.   We have also to recognise that the Staff Side will not accept that the central pay settlement of 1969 can be taken as our starting p-sint.   That settlement was based on the 3-g-&apos;X- annualceiling then in force and did not purport in any way to bringCivil Service pay up to the proper &apos;fair comparison&apos; level.    TheStaff Side are concerned with the discrepancy between pay move-ments outside the Service since 1 January 1968 when a &quot;faircomparison&quot; rate was last established for the main Civil Servicegrades and the 5$ increase which is all that these grades have had since then.   Their present claim cannot reasonably be regarded asre-opening the July 1969 central pay settlement which they regard(correctly) as having dene little to keep Civil Service salaries in line.
Re commende d Coursejsf m Act Ion18.    It is against this background that I have had to consider what course of action to propose to my colleagues.    It is mostimportant that we should reach a negotiated settlement on an acceptable basis; if we were forced to arbitration I have nodoubt that in present circumstances they would make a very sub-stantial award.   And I cannot too strongly emphasise the harm thatwould be done to staff relations if we allow large increases to be forced from us by arbitration and lose this opportunity tore-establish confidence in the Whitley system.   My conclusion isthat we should make an offer on the following lines :-(a) it would specify the level of a central pay increase for 1970 only.    If we were to attempt new to negotiate a longer term agreement with the Staff Side we should not reach one without conceding a larger increase for succeedingyears than would be justified before future trends havefully shown themselves;(b) it would provide for a return to a situation in which the pay of the whole non-industrial Civil Service is reviewed eachyear with effect from a common date of 1 January.    If this can be negotiated it should be achieved by means of centralpay increases on 1 April 1970 and 1 January 1971.    Butdepending on the course of negotiations it might be preferable to concede an effective date of 1 January 1970 in theinterests of negotiating a lower percentage increase (whichwould, apart from other considerations, be helpful inrelation to the settlements for those grades covered by thecurrent pay research negotiations).   This would follow the precedent set by the Post Office settlement where the new corporation saw similar advantages in a common date of review for its staff;(c) it would provide for the same percentage increase to be payable to all those grades not covered by the current pay research negotiations.    It could be argued that those grades in paragraph 10(&quot; ) above should receive a higher increasethan those in paragraph 10(a) above, on the grounds thattheir last pay increase dates from 1 January 1969 (with a second stage    payable on 1 January 1970) whereas their other colleagues received last year?s central pay increase on1 July 1969.   But on the other hand those grades in paragraph10(a) could claim, on the evidence of movements in the wagesindex, to have fallen further behind over the last 18 monthsthan those in paragraph 10(b).    The best course would be togive parity of treatment as part of the process of returning to a common review date;(d) subject to a satisfactory resolution **f the organisationalproblems in shortening the pay research cycle we should nowconfirm our offer of a move from a 3 year to a 2 year cycle.This would be helpful in securing a negotiated settlement onreasonable lines since it will be a further positive assurance of our intention to ensure that Civil Service pay is-71
maintained on a &quot;fair comparison&quot; basis.    It will also havethe advantage of reducing the level of the pay researchsettlements which are required when Civil Service pay lagstoo far behind outside rates.   Any central pay increase for1970 will of course itself lead to a reduction in the levelof increase which will have to be negotiated on the basisof subsequent pay research surveys since it will serve toreduce the present disparity between pay inside and outsidethe Service.19.   For reasons of confidentiality I shall not include in thismemorandum any recommendation on the level of increase within TihichI seek authority to negotiate but will put any proposals to mycolleagues by direct correspondence before the Committee meets.But from what I have said in this memorandum, it will be clearthat I consider that the increase must be a substantial one.INCOMES POLICY REQUIREMENTS20.    It will be clear from what I have already said that I do not see how it will be possible to reconcile the level and timing ofany settlement which would not appear to discriminate against theCivil Service with the requirements of the 12 months&apos; rule and the2%?c - h^fh range.    On the cither hand an offer on the lines proposedcould be justified within the terms of the White Paper sectionson the public services and on market requirements.REPERCUSSIONS21 .    I recognise that a central pay increase for the Civil service would have direct implications for some other public services.    Thelargest of these is the National Health Service, where some75sOOO administrative,&apos; clerical, technical and works staff havedirect pay links with the Civil Service; a 1 per cent increase for these grades vi/ould cost rather less than  1 m in a full year.Another is the Atomic Energy Authority, where a 1 per cent increase for grades linked to those in paragraphs 10(a) and 10(b) above would add about  -^m to the salary bill.   But these inevitableconsequential increases are relatively small and, since similarrepercussions always occur whenever widespread Civil Serviceincreases are given, they should not in my view influence our decision cn the merits.CONCLUSION22.    If we can reach a negotiated settlement which the Staff Sideaccepts as a fair and reasonable one we shall have gone a longway towards containing the threat of militancy.    If we fail to doso it will be at the cost of increasing resentment within theService which could seriously impede moves towards greater efficiency and post-Fulton restructuring, undermine staff rela-tions in the Civil Service still further and give rise to industrial action of a limited but damaging kind.   While the whitley Council negotiating machinery has been subjected to serious strains in recent years,   it still commands widespread8
confidence among Civil Service staff.    We must not lend support to the growing number who argue that it is only by militantaction that the Government can be persuaded to accord treatment to its own employees which fairly matches that of the rest ofthe community.S.Civil Service Department, SW120 February 1 970
