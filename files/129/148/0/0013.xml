The Home Affairs Committee on 13th February agreed to proposals(a) and (b), subject to the Departments concerned absorbing the relatively small costs involved within their expenditure allocations.    They also agreed (c). though the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food hassubsequently expressed certain reservations on it which can be further discussed with him without at this stage troubling other colleagues.    Theywere sympathetic to proposed (d), but have referred it to colleagues becauseof its public expenditure implications.
The Importance, of including the scheme- of r.compensation for injuriousaffection.3.      In considering the expenditure implications of proposal (d), itshould be borne in mind that  bis proposed scheme on injurious affection,both on merits and presenfca tionally, is the main par?: of the package,,Without it, the other proposals would look very thin,    I accept, ofcourse (as I understand do all the spending Ministers concerned)!,that a commitment to it now must be without prejudice to the decisions which Ministers must take in due course about priorities and totalDepartmental expenditures for 1973-V74 onwards.    Eut I. believe thatthis should not deter usj and the object of this memorandum is to saywhy040       The injurious affection that we are here dealing with is the depreciation in property value that is caused by nearby public development:The most obvious example is the impact of the urban motor way 0    As thelaw stands, an owner some of whose land is acquired for purposes of ascheme of public development is entitled to compensation for depreciationto his remaining land (thoughthe amount is restricted to the loss in valuedue to those portions of the public works which are sited within the piece of land actually acquired from him)c    But the owner from whom no landis taken does not in practice have an equally effective remedy - even though he might well have had a remedy at common law if development withsimilarly injurious effects had been carried out by a private firm or individual.    This is due mainlv^to a House of Lords decision in 1874that has cast doubt on the rightjcompensation for the effects of the useof public works.    Thus m practice someone whose established legal rightto light is infringed by the construction of an elevated motorway may havea chance of compensation, but there is little chance of getting it for theproperty value depreciation caused by the noise, fumes, dust, etc, arisingfrom the purposes to which the motorway is put,50       This apparently privileged position for public development mayhave been acceptable in the circumstances of the 19th century,,    It is very-difficult to defend in the very different circumstances of today?  and the sense of injustice that it engenders adds to the already considerablepresentational difficulties that confront public authorities (includingMinisters) responsible for planning and providing essential public services,,60      Various proposals for changes in the lav/ in. this respect have beenput forward by professional bodies representing lawyers and surveyors,and also by the local authority associations,    Mre Walter Clegg is proposingvery sweeping changes in a Private Member8^ Bill due for its SecondReading debate on 27th February,     The Conservative Party have said,in &quot;Make Life Better&quot;?&quot;People whose houses, shops or land are affected by development will get proper compensation&quot;.Ax-id in the forthcoming GLC elections they will be able to point to the factthat in London they have been pressing for something to be done about this for years,
The safeguards in the scheme70       The Minister of Housing*s scheme could, 1 believe, take the forceout. of these pressures before they pain further momentum - if it isannounced soon.    The basic principle it follows is that public authoritiesv/hose new works harmfully affect nearby owners, even though -withoutactually taking any of their land, should be put under broadly the sameliability in this respect as private developers.    This is conceptuallyin line with the recommendations in a recent report by Justice,recommending that such owners should have a right to compensationif a common law action in nuisance would have been available to thembut for the protection enjoyed, by public authorities,,    The difference in method, however, is that instead of making the owners concerneddependent for their new remedy on common law action, the Minister&apos;scheme would spell out the scope and limitations of their rights in thestatute itself,80      I can understand the Treasuryls natural concern lest these limitations should prove vulnerable to pressures for relaxation witha consequential increase in the total cost of the scheme,    But it seemsto me, as it did to the Official Committee, that in practice they can beheld without much difficulty 09o       To start with, it should be easy enough to defend the proposition that compensation should be payable only for depreciation arising from what could in the case of a private development constitute a nuisanceat common law, and the legislation would therefore specify the qualifyingcauses - eQ g. noise, dust, fumes,10,.      Compensation would be payable only where the amount of depreciation due to these causes was more than 10 per cent, andthis could be justified as doing no more than reflect in statutoryterms the fact that in the private sector where the common lawapplies there must in practice be a fairly serious degree of nuisancebefore the courts are willing to grant an hi junction or award damages,This limitation is also defensible in practical terms on the basis that,if there is to be a statutory right to compensation, the damage sufferedmust be clearly demonstrable among the complex of factors which enterinto the value of property?  otherwise there could be a large number oftrifling claims and disputes bringing little public or private advantage.II.       The scheme would apply only in cases where public authoritiescarry out development - either for new or for extended projects,,    Thisagain should be easily defensible, on the basis that the compensationproposals as a whole are all about the acquisition or development ofland, and so far as injurious affection is concerned,, are thereforerelated to the direct, immediate and demonstrable consequences ofaction taken by public authorities as land-acquiring developers, andnot to the effects of what they may do or allow well after (or irrespective of whether) land development has taken place    Thus it should be possible without any real difficulty to resist any pressure for this particularCONFIDENTSAL
measure to include compensation for the effects of mere intensifications ofexisting uses - which are not normally related to specific land developmentoperations, are not necessarily ever, within public authorities&apos; control., canseldom be accurately related to specific changes in the value of property,and are therefore not comparablewMinewlacd-usiag projects that areLikely by their nature, and can be shown in ffe* event... to have a direct and identifiable impact on the property around them,    Cf course,pressures for remedies for the effects of activities, as distinct from the effects of land acquisition and development? do and willcontinue to exist;  but they exist and can be dealt with (or resisted)independently of land compensation lav/ - e, gc grants for sound insulationround Heathrow, or refusal of similar grants in other cases,,120      It is also proposed, as a basic part of the scheme, ths.t claims for compensation should not be admitted until two years after completion ofthe public works concerned - thus allowing property values to settle, andprotecting the authorities from having to compensate for purely transitorydepreciations.    The line on this should not be difficult to hold, especially as provisions would be incorporated for safeguarding those owner-occupier ev/ho for other reasons had to sell their property during the two-year period,13c       Finally there is the safeguard of specifying the types of new or extended public works to which the new scheme should relate,.,    The Idinisterof Housing, in agreement with his colleagues concerned, has proposed thatthe list should be restricted to the kinds of development that are obviouslylikely to trouble neighbouring owners - roads, sewage works, and refuse-works, plus (possibly) airports, though I understand that in practice it isnot expected that any new airport sites will be developed during the nextfew years,,    From the public expenditure point of view it may not be allthat important whether the list is restricted in this way or left open, sincethe various other possibilities that spring to mind (e9 g0 prisons, defenceinstallations, power stations, gas works, schools, local authority housing)would in practice normally be ruled out by one or more of the otherlimitations mentioned in paragraphs 9-12 above    Either they will not give rise to sustained depreciation of at least 10 per cent, or the depreciation will not be due to any of the kinds of factor that willhave to be present to qualify for compensation,    (Indeed, even airportsdon8t seem to do much harm in practice to property values in theirvicinity).    Nevertheless, it seems better to make clear from the startwhat are and what are not the kinds of development to which thecompensation scheme is addressed;, in order to reduce misunderstandingand discourage -widespread unsuccessful claims as well as avoiding atheoretically open-ended public expenditure commitment.    AccordinglyI would propose that we should settle for a firm list,, as the Minister of housing has suggested, and I would welcome my colleagues views as towhether any other types of works should be added to those which he liasproposeda
Cost14c      Given, all these limitations, together forming a defensible basis for resisting any material extension of the scheme proposed, I see noreason to doubt the reasonableness cf the estimate already made of thecost of the scheme - between VI\ million and  15 million annually, mostof it occurring from 1973-74 onwards.    And it is, I think, important tobear in mind (quite apart from whatever decisions may be made on thepublic expenditure review) that this is not necessarily a net addition tothe expenditure that might otherwise have been incurred in the sectorsconcerned.    For it seems likely that, in the absence of -provisions ofthe kind proposed, public authorities would in many capes be undergrowing pressure to resort to more expensive locations and designsand land purchases for their development projects than would otherwise be thought necessary, in order to buy off opposition that a limited butdefensible scheme of compensation could have allayed.Timing15,      As the Minister of Housing has pointed out, we shall be in an increasingly embarrassing position if we cannot soon show some positiveresults from our land compensation review as a whole, and in particularpromise to prepare legislation on blight and injurious affection.    To beready with a Bill for next Session, however, the Departments concernedneed authority to start work on it now - with early access to Counsel,To postpone a decision until the summer would mean (and would be seen to mean) postponing the possibility of a Bill until I971&quot;72,    Moreover,to meet mounting cx-iticismj, we need to make a statement now - and itwould be highly convenient to be able to do so in the course of the SecondReading debate on Clegg2s Bill on 27th February,    A draft of the kindof statement that might be made (and would net give rise to any problemsof forestalling or delaying action by property &quot;Owners) is attached at annex A,ConclusionsI6a      I invite my colleagues to agree that the scheme of compensationfor injurious affection is a necessary part of the proposals for improvementin the compensation code;  that the limitations incorporated in it aredefensible;  that the public expenditure implications are therefore adequatelylimited:;  and that although these should of course be taken into account inthe normal public expenditure review this summer, they should not preventour deciding and starting now to prepare the necessary legislation, or ourannouncing now that we intend to do so0Storey8s Gate, 30Tv70l,20th February, 1970
DRAFT STATEMENT ANNEX A1.     The Government have now completed their review of thewhole field of land compensation.     In carrying out the review we have had the &quot;benefit of the views of the profes-siwns (in memoranda prepared by the Chartered Land societies and by JUSTICE) and of the local authority associations andthe GLC.      I will deal with our main conclusions under three headings - compensation for compulsory purchase;injurious affection;    and planning blight.2.     The present basis of compensation for compulsory purchaseis the market value of the interest which is acquired.     some have criticised this basis, and have put forward proposalswhich would provide for payment well above market value inmany cases.     Others have argued that the market value basisshould remain, subject to minor adjustments.     The history ofcompensation over the past century has included systems forpaying more than market value and systems providing for payingless.     We have concluded that in fact the market value basiscomes as close as possible to being fair to both sides - tothe individual whose property is being acquired, and to thecommunity as a whole that has to meet the bill.     We have therefore decided that the market value basis of compensation should remain;    and it is in keeping with this that we havealready taken action, in the Housing Act, 1969,  to provide for payments equivalent to market value to virtually all owner-occupiers of publicly-acquired unfit houses, who under previouslaw would mostly have got far less.
3.     I turn now to injurious affection: - that is,  the depreciation sometimes caused by new development, such asa motorway, to nearby property which is not itself acquiredfor purposes of that development.      It may be that continuingimprovements in planning and design techniques will help usin time to reduce the incidence and scale of this particular problem;    but it would be unrealistic to expect to be able todo away with it altogether.     And the present position isthat a person from whom no land is taken has in practice verylittle prospect of receiving compensation for any depreciationin the value of his property caused by the use of public worksconstructed on adjoining land.     The Government have concluded that this is not good enough.     Broadly speaking, public authorities should in their view have to accept as nearly aspossible the same kind of financial liability in this respectas private developers.     Accordingly, they propose to intro-duce a new scheme whereby compensation will be claimable incases of substantial and permanent depreciation in valuecaused to nearby properties by the physical effects of the useof specified kinds of new public works.     The necessary legislation will now be prepared,  in readiness for introduction in the 1970-71 Session.h.      It is proposed that this legislation should deal also with planning blight.     This is the depreciation in valuesometimes caused to property by the threat of its futureacquisition by an authority possessing compulsory powers.Those most in need of help in these cases already have a
remedy eventually, in that where a formally establishedproposal involving eventual acquisition has the effect thatthe owner-occupier of a house or small &quot;business premisescannot sell his property at a reasonablep?ice on the open market he can serve a &quot;blight notice&quot; on the public authority concerned, requiring them to buy at undepreciatedvalue.     The Government are satisfied that only these classesof owner-occupiers should continue to have this remedy as of right.     But they have concluded that the right should beavailable earlier than under present law.     The owner-occupiers concerned should not have to wait, as they must do at present, until the proposal causing the blight has reached a fairly advanced stage - e.g., has been approvedby the Government Department concerned.     They should beentitled to serve a blight notice as soon as the public authority have definitely decided, in the light of any11necessary local soundings, what they want to do and have,if necessary, submitted the proposal to the appropriate minister for approval.     Pending the legislation, local-authorities will be recommended to use their existingdiscretionary powers to buy in cases of this kind;    and government Departments will do likewise,
