IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)64C(70) 22 COPY NO0____10th February, 1970CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1969-70Memorandum by the Lord President of the council at their meeting on 5th February, 1970 the Cabinet invited me to circulate a memorandum on the progress of the current legislative programme (CC(70) 6th Conclusions, Minute 2)020      The Annex to this memorandum shows the stage reached by ail BillsIncluded in the approved essential list, main programme and reserve list and Second Reading Committee list, and by other Bills which It hassubsequently been decided to introduce.    It will be seen from this that;leaving on one side the two Bills which are to be fitted in If time permits(Civil Aviation and Registration of Employers); there are eleven Bills Inthe main programme yet to be Introduced, of which Public SeryiceSuperannuation may be disregarded since it will not be requlr-ed this session unless the Session is prolonged,3,      Of the remaining ten Bills, Atomic Energy Authority and LocalAuthority Social Services have been approved by Legislation Committeeand should be introduced this week; Electricity has also passed legislation committee, but is held up pending the addition of provisions conferringwider manufacturing powers.    Industrial Safety and Health and TrawlerSafety it is hoped to bring before Legislation. Committee next week.    Thatleaves five Bills - Commission on Industry and Manpower), Drugs,,Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations)t Industrial Relations and shipbuilding and Industry Guaranteesa of which at least the first twoshould be ready In. March.,4c      I drew attention earlier in the Session to the fact that instructions for main programme Bills were coming forward too slowly and that we werenot making the best use of ot*r drafting resources.    As a result we now have too many Bills chasing too few draftsmen,.    Some main programmeBills have been held back to enable others to make better progress? and second Reading Committee Bj2!ss which are of lower priority, have been generally delayed.    Moreover, hi these circumstances time spent in improving the drafting of Private Members- Bills which we accept inprinciple inevitably delays the drafting of Government Bills,
50      Because Bills have been coming forward slowly, both Houses havebeen short of legislative business,.    The Lord Privy Seal drew attentionlast week to the situation in. the House of Lords I and in the Commons wehave had to eke out the business on the Floor with Supply Days and debates on Orders,   (Standing Committeese on the other hand, are fully extended,as we have known all along they would be).    I well understand that the lords would like more Bills,, but Bills which are highly controversial politicallyor largely financial In character must start in the Commons; of the 28Bills introduced In the CommonSj, 15 have already been passed to the Lords,60      We have,. I thlnk^ a reasonable chance of passing all the Bills Inthe main programme by the Summer E.recess except those which are bothlong and late in coming forward^ Industrial Relations comes in this categoryand so will Civil Aviationf unless it can be shortened.    But, in order tokeep to this timetable,, I must ask my colleagues to ensure that outstandinginstructions are submitted as soon as possible and that their Departmentsdeal speedily with drafts and queries^,Privy Council Office^, S9V/ol010th February., 1970i I-*2&apos;-
