[HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)REPORT OF T&apos;HE NATIONAL LIBRARIES committee memorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and ScienceAt their meeting on 29th January the Ministerial steering committee on Economic Policy (SEP) invited me to circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet on the policy implications of the Da hit on Committee report and a number of particular points arising out if it.General Policy Implications2.      The countryss library system, which has grown up piecemeal overthe years, is faced with problems on a new scale.   The world&apos;s output of scientific literature is estimated to be doubling every 15 years, and thegrowth in other fields is comparable.   Demands for library and information services increase accordingly.   New techniques, particularly those involving automatic data processing, require large scaleorganization to yield their full potential benefits.   Against this background the National Libraries Committee concluded that the four main nationallibraries the British Museum Library (BML), the National ReferenceLibrary of Science and Invention, (NRLSI), the National Central Library,(NCL), and the National Lending Library for Science and Technology,(NLLST) should be brought together under a new statutory and independentpublic body to be known as the National Libraries Authority (NLA), whichwould also include the British National Bibliography (at present privately owned).3.      The NLA would provide the policy direction and the administrativeco-ordination needed to develop our national library services to meetchanging circumstances and to make the best use of the considerableresources committed.   It would study the needs of users, formulaterequirements in detail, negotiate arrangements with outside bodies,establish priorities and build up an integrated long term programme for itscomponent institutions.The NRLSI and the Attitude of industry.      The case for a single independent authority was accepted by theHome Affairs Committee.   In recommending this solution I have givenparticular weight to the needs of industry and commerce.

industrial and commercial organizations that use the NRLSI and NLLSThas challenged the case for a single National Libraries Authority, butthere is a strong consensus among them that the NRLSI should be administered separately from the BML.   This too was the view of theDainton Committee and I agree with it.   It is agreed by all concerned,including the Confederation of British Industries (CBI) and the trustees of the British Museum, that the highest building priority should go to theerection of a new NRLSI in central London.   The main considerations affecting the site are:(a) the view strongly held by the Trustees (and many others) that thetwo libraries should be on the same sites they accept that theyshould be in separate buildings:(b) ^he need to ensure that the NRLSI is readily accessible to thePatent Office (at present in Holborn) and the Patent Communitywho are its main users.Further studies and discussions will be needed urgently before a finaldecision can be reached.   They will include more detailed study of the feasibility of building on the Bloomsbury site and will take account of theGovernments plans for the rehousing of the Patent Office, but there are good prospects of reconciling the needs of the various interests.5.      The CBI have emphasised that the NLA should have a considerable measure of independence, that the members of the Board should have ahigh level of management skill and experience, that the Authority shouldhave a major research function, that regional science referencefacilities should be developed as recommended by the Dainton Committeeand that close liaison with other bodies should be maintained.    They laidgreat stress on the need to develop the role of the NRLSI and arguedagainst any specific restriction of its coverage.   I am in general agreementwith all these views, subject to the ultimate determination of prioritieswithin a properly costed and integrated programme.   In the short term theprovision of a new building for NRLSI should command the highest priority.   Clearly the interests of industry and technology should be strongly represented in a NLA.The British Museum Reading Room6.      Nothing in the proposals before us involves any threat to the fabricof the reading room, and on any assumption it will have to continue to fulfil its present function for several years.   When a new building for theBritish Museum Library, which will incorporate new reading rooms, hasbeen completed, the reading room will be released from its present use and will be available to the Trustees to use as seems best at the time.The central position makes it an important part of the Museum building,and we can be sure that a worthy use will be found,.2-
The Attitude of the Trustees of the British Museurn7.      At their monthly meeting held on 31st January the Trustees ofthe British Museum were asked to amplify their earlier statement aboutthe proposal that they should hand over control of the BML to a new NLA.As a result the Director of the Museum was authorised to write the lettergiven in Annex A to the Department.   The Annex also gives the texts oftwo subsequent letters which were exchanged and which provided theopportunity for some further clarification.8.      The assurances I have received clear the way for the statement to be made.   The text, given in Annex B, differs in only three minorrespects from that discussed by SEP; an additional sentence has been added at the end to meet a suggestion by the President of the Board ofTrade, and two changes have been made in the first paragraph in thelight of the correspondence with the British Museum.   Thereafter wewould proceed at once to further negotiations with the Trustees leading up to the preparation of a White Paper and the eventual introduction oflegislation.   The Ministry of Public Building and Works, the Ministry of housing and Local Government, the Ministry of Technology and theBoard of Trade (in view of the Patent Office interest) would be associatedas necessary with these negotiations.conclusion.      I recommend accordingly that the statement should be made as soonas convenient and that we should then start consultations with the british museum Trustees and other bodies concerned with a view to the publicationof a White Paper (which I will submit to my colleagues in draft) as early inthe summer as possible.E, W. S.Department of Education and Science, W. L,26th February, 1970
Text of a Letter dated 2nd February 1970 from the Directorof the British Museum to the P e raan eat Under-3e cretary of State DSSThe Trustees of the British Museum were informed, at their meetingon Saturday last, of the conversation which you and I had had on theprevious evening, and of the events which had led up to it.    after discussion they agreed that I should write to you on the following lines; -Although the majority of the earlier books and manuscriptscame to the British Museum by gift or bequest,  the Trustees have long held that it is in the national interest that the british museum Library (with the exception of the Department of Prints andDrawings)  should become part of a national reference librarystructure.    They have therefore welcomed, as their comments to theDepartment on the Bainton Report indicated, the major recommend-ation of that Committee that a National Libraries Authority shouldbe established.    To such an Authority they would be content to handover in due course the custody, administration and control of theBritish Museum Library provided thata) there is full consultation, in the period between theGovernment statement and the proposed 7/hite Paper and theWhite Paper and legislation, about such subjects as, forexample, the structure,  scope and responsibilities of theNational Libraries Authority, the physical planning of theNational Reference Library of Gcience and Invention, andthe copyright acquisitions;b) at all stages until the National Libraries Authority is fully operational and has buildings available to accommodate the books there is adequate machinery to ensurethat the relevant libraries are involved in the planning ofthe process of transfer to the National Libraries Authority,preferably by means of an interim Joint Board.Text of a Letter dated 10th February 1970 from the DES to theDirector of the British MuseumIn Herbert Andrew&apos;s absence I am writing to thank you for your letter of 2nd February.    The fuller statement that it embodies ofthe Trustees&apos; acceptance of the recommendation of the DaintonReport that a National Libraries Authority should be established isvery helpful.    (The question of the future of the Department ofPrints and Drawings should not, 1 believe be a major obstacle).Your letter expresses the willingness of the Trustees to hand overto the NLA in due course, the custody, administration and control ofthe British Museum Library, subject to two provisos.    The firstconcerns consultation on various matters during the period between a Government statement of intent to set up the NLA and the1
publication of a White Paper, and again between the publication ofthe White Paper and legislation to give effect to its proposals.I can see no difficulty over this;    consultation throughout theseperiods would be essential.The effect of the second proviso is more difficult to assess.    Itlocks beyond the passing of legislation (which is not likely tobe before 1972), and covers the period&quot;until the national LibrariesAuthority is fully operational and has buildings available to accommodate the books . . . .&apos;;   Applying this phrase to the british museum Library (for the sake of simplicity i leave on one side theother libraries, while recognising that they too have theirlegitimate interests which they would be concerned to safeguard intheir discussions with the Government), eight or ten years mightelapse before new buildings for both BML and NRLSI are completed.Throughout this period, I assume,  the BML must continue to occupyits present accommodation in the Museum Building.    Mo one would, Ithink, dispute that while this situation remains the Trustees couldlegitimately expect to have the last word in matters of domesticadministration and security, and a large say in other matters,  suchas staffing, which might affect the Museum.    Nor could one quarrelwith the proposition that the timing of the NLAs assumption of its duties should depend on its readiness to discharge them,  and that thhand over should be an orderly one worked out in consultation withits predecessors.    But it would be equally important that the NLA,once established, should make an early start in co-ordinating theservices and operations of the principal national libraryinstitutions, of which the British Museum Library is the largestandthe most important,  and in promoting their effective development.In making this point I do not wish to imply that it is incompatible with the position of the Trustees.    If that were so it would not be easy to see the way forward.    But since the Trustees have beenfrank in indicating matters to which they will attach importance in subsequent negotiations, it may help if I set cut some of the considerations which are likely to weigh with the Government in seeking a solution acceptable to those concerned and conducive tothe national interest.Text of Sir John Wolfenden&apos;s letter of 16th FebruaryThank you very much for your letter of 1 1th February.    I shall havetc lay it before my Trustees when they next meet and I will let youknew their reaction thereafter.    But my personal opinion, for what it is worth, is that there is nothing in it which need cause the many disquiet.211
DRAFT statement the Government have decided to accept in principle the main commendation of the National Libraries Committee, namely that aNational Libraries Authority should be established, to take overin due course the administration of the present British MuseumLibrary and National Reference Library for Science and Inventionand other institutions.    Further consideration is being given tothe structure,  scope and responsibilities of this authority and toa number of other issues raised in the Committee&apos;s report.    these will form the subject matter of a White Paper to be issued after further consultation as a preliminary to legislation.Meanwhile, in the light of the Committee&apos;s recommendations onthe siting of the British Museum Library and the National ReferenceLibrary of Science and Invention, and taking account of the latesttechnical developments in the storage of books, a new preliminaryassessment has been made of the possibility of meeting the needsof both libraries on a smaller area of the Bloomsbury site than was previously envisaged for the British Museum Library alone.This gives grounds for hope that it might prove possible to meetthe needs of both libraries, while providing considerably morehousing on the site than was included in the earlier plan,preserving all the main listed buildings including the whole ofthe West side of Bloomsbury Square, and removing the need for a, ifurther site elsewhere in Central London for the NationalReference Library of Science and Invention.    In view of theresults of this preliminary assessment the Government havedecided to explore further the feasibility of a solution on theselines.In reaching their final conclusion they will, of course, pay full regard to the requirements of the users of both libraries.
