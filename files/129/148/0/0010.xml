CONFIDENTIALANNUAL REVIEW OF THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY 1970Second Report to MinistersSUMMARY note.     We submitted in our Report to Ministers on 16th January (AP(70)1) an assessment of progress under the Selective Expansion Programme against a back-ground of factual data on supplies, prices and support costs.   We indicatedth-.t our second report would deal with the conclusions we might reach after examination of all the economic data and other relevant factors, including theviews expressed by the farmers&apos; representatives.2.     &apos;.-.&apos;e are now submitting our report and recommendations regarding guaranteed prices and other agricultural supports, which are agreed by all Departmentsrepresented on the Official Team.   They are summarised for the convenience ofMinisters in the immediately following paragraphs.&apos;3,    The main features of the economic data are the recovery in net output and net income in 1969/70 from their depressed levels in 1968/69;   and the increaseof about  60 million in costs.   Despite the recovery in income, however, there isan inevitable time-lag before the improvement works through to the industry.And in the meantime higher costs have reduced the capacity to expand, particularly where further investment would have been necessary to do so.4.     A more detailed appreciation of the position is given in paragraphs 4-2-4-5of the report.5.     The views expressed by the farmers&apos; representatives are set out fully inparagraphs 34 to 41 -   Their basic argument is that the industry has been deniedsufficient resources either to ensure a satisfactory return on farmers&apos; labour and capital or to sustain the continued expansion they consider economicallyadvantageous to the country.   They are, therefore, primarily concerned to secure a large increase in profitability both as a matter of equity (about which theyhave expressed strong feeling) and as a means of ensuring the cash for investment in expansion.
6,    Whilst recognising the element akin to a wage demand in the farmers&apos; claims, wehave considered primarily what measures would be most likely in present circumstances to avoid any general recession in the industry and to keep production on coursetowards the objectives of the Government&apos;s Selective Expansion Programme.   To thisend, our proposals are as follows:(i) commodity determinations worth some  52 million, which not only lay mostemphasis on the priority commodities (paragraphs 47 to 49) but also provideI for a desirable approach and impetus to the eradication of brucellosis(paragraph 50);(ii) further measures, outside the normal run of Review determinations, designedto relieve the immediate cash needs of many farmers and to inject capital for further investment.   To this end we propose that the rates of the fertiliser and lime subsidies should be increased by  10 million for one yearonly;   and that the rates of the capital grants should be raised so as toprovide an extra  20 million over the next two years.   These measures are described more fully in paragraphs 57-58.7.     It would be made clear in the presentation of this package that it was designedto meet this year&apos;s special circumstances and implied no reversal of policy inregard to the selective expansion programme based on increasing productivity whichshould contribute to meeting cost increases.I8.    The total public expenditure implications of these proposals are set out inparagraphs 59-60.   Briefly, they would entail an additional demand on the contingency reserve of some  11^ million in 1970/71 and of some  17 million in 1971/72.9.    The Official Team has reached agreement on these proposals in the knowledge thatthey were acceptable to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Agricultural MinistersIas setting the limits within which negotiations should take place.   In invitinggeneral approval for the recommendations listed in paragraph 62, it is not suggestedthat they will necessarily command the agreement of the farmers&apos; leaders.   We have noIhesitation, however, in claiming that they would provide the resources necessary tothe continued well-being of the industry and to secure further progress towards theI    objectives of the selective expansion programme.

Annual Review of Agricultural Industry 1970Second Report lay OfficialsINTRODUCTION1.   The agricultural departments have now held the statutory Annual Review ofthe economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry in consulta-tion with the farmers&apos; representatives.   In this report we discuss the conclusions to be drawn from the Review and make provisional recommendations for changes inthe guaranteed prices and production grants.   Instructions are sought for thefurther discussions with the farmers which are due to begin on 20th   February.2.   The general objective of the support system is set out in Section 1 of the agriculture Act 1947 as being the maintenance of&quot;a stable and efficient agri-cultural industry capable of producing such part of the nation&apos;s food and other agricultural produce as in the national interest it is desirable to produce inthe United Kingdom, and of producing it at minimum prices consistently with proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers and workers in agricultureand an adequate return on capital invested in the industry.&quot;   This aim isphrased in very general terms and may be taken as expressing only the main factors which Ministers should consider when determining new levels for the guarantees.3.   It is a statutory requirement that there has to be each year a review of theeconomic condition   and prospects of the agricultural industry in consultationwith producers&apos; representatives.   Ministers are then required to determine the levels of the guaranteed prices for the major, specified commodities and ofcertain production grants in the light of their conclusions from this review.Two points may be noted.   First, although the review itself relates to the wholeof the agricultural industry and aggregate income and net output are calculated onthat basis, only about three-quarters of total output is covered by the price guarantees and is therefore directly affected by changes in these prices.   Theposition on non-guaranteed products is thus part of the background to the review.
although no decisions fall to be taken on them.   Second, by long establishedconvention the Annual Review and the guarantee arrangements generally are confined to tenant farming activities and exclude the activities of landowners.   A consequencehas been that owners&apos; investment and grants to encourage such investment hsve not normally been examined specifically at the Review.   And income attributable to land-owning is not included in estimates of aggregate net farming income.   Capital grantsdo however form part of the total cost of agricultural support, as shown in theAnnual Review Uhite Paper and in the P.E.S.C. Reports.4.     The present Review has as background the Government&apos;s policy of selective expansion for agriculture, which was reaffirmed in 1968.   The extended expansion programme then announced indicated in general terms the guide-lines for thedevelopment of agricultural production over the period to 1972/73, consistent withthe statutory objectives of the Agriculture Acts.5.     A further background consideration is that the level of agricultural production at the time would have important implications for the overall cost of entry if wewere to go into the S.E.C.EXAMINATION OF RELEVANT DATASet Output6.     The index of net output in agriculture measures the value added at constant prices to the goods and services purchased from outside the agricultural sector.The inputs side of the calculation also includes an allowance for depreciation.   Theindex fell sharply from 106 in 1967/68 to 101 in 1968/69, but is expected to recoverto 106 in 1969/70 (average of 1964/65-1966/67 = 100).   Lower production of beeffollowing the foot-and-mouth epidemic and a poor cereals harvest were the chief reasonsfor the fall in 1968/69.   Most items of output are forecast to show a recovery in1969/70 but this will be partly offset by some increase in inputs.Increased efficiency and, labour productivity7.     The annual rate of gain in agricultural efficiency is conventionally taken asabout  30 million taking one year with another for products covered by guaranteed prices.     This increase may not be achieved in a particular year such as 1968/69when conditions were especially adverse for many sectors of farming, but takingone year with another and provided that output is expanding it should lead to anincrease in income if cost increases are recouped in full by increases in the guarantees.     Increases in labour productivity (the volume of net output per man year)2.
confidentialprovide important contributions to this gain.   In most recent years there hasbeen an increase in labour productivity of 6-7 per cent although there was a smallactual decrease in 1968/69, due mainly to the exceptionally heavy fall in net output.    Over the period 1963/64 to 1969/70 there has been an average annual rateof increase of 5-6 per cent.   The total labour supply (including farmers&apos; labour)has been falling by about 5 per cent annually since 1963-64.   However, the numberof regular whole-time workers (the largest element) which, dropped by 6-7 per centannually from 1964 to 1966 has be-n going down by about 5 per cent annually since1967.   The agricultural departments see no reason why the rundo\^i of theagricultural labour force at current rates should jeopardise the selective expansion programme, provided that capital   is invested in the industry at a sufficientrate.Cost changes8.     On the most recent estimate the net effect in a full year of cost changes sincethe last Review - on tho assumption of an unchanged volume for each factor ofproduction - is an increase of  31 million overall of which  62 million is theestimated increase for guaranteed products.   In accordance with decision:;- already taken by Ministers a sum of  1.9 million is to be paid to the AgriculturalTraining Board in lieu of the payment of training levies by farmers in GreatBritain and the r-anie figure is to be deducted from the figure for cost changes to be taken into account.   Under similar arrangements a sum of  0.1 mi].lion in afull year is to be paid for training in northern Ireland but only  10,000 willbe paid in 1970/71;   because of rounding this cannot be shown specifically inthe 1970 costs figure and will be carried forward to the 1971 Review when thefull deduction for Northern Ireland training will be talen into account.   Thisleaves a net figure of  60 million to be taken into account at this Review.   Ofthe total increase a third is due to higher labour costs and another third to higher prices of feedingstuffs and machinery.   There is a small decrease due tocuts in fertiliser prices.   These figures for cost changes take account of changes which have occurred since the last Review or are expected to occur in the nearfuture but make no allowance for further changes which may occur before thenext Review such as the prospective increase in machinery prices as a result ofthe recent rise of 10 per cent in steel prices.   In addition they do not allow for prospective changes in the volume of inputs used by the industry, for example,the decline in the number of workers or the increase in fertiliser usage:   changes of this sort -.re taken into account in the calculation of the value of increasing efficiency.   They are therefore not forecasts of the way in which the industry&apos;soverall costs will be affected in practice.3.
These differ from the depreciation charges allowed by the Inland Revenue inthat they are calculated on gross replacement costs instead of historic costsbut use longer write-off periods.   In aggregate the two methods produce very similar results.&apos;   4.NET INCOMEConcepts9.    There are two main series of net income figures in farming - one for theaggregate income of the industry and one for different types and sizes of farm.Aggregate net farm income is calculated by deducting from gross income along withother operating expenses a charge for interest on identifiable commercialborrowing and depreciation provisions^ on plant, machinery and vehicles and adding in the increase in the valuations of crops, livestock and miscellaneousfarm stocks.   Because the Annual Review is confined to tenant farming activities,a figure for rent is charged which represents partly the rent actually paid bytenants and partly an imputed rent attributable to owner-occupied farms.   Thusaggregate net income excludes both the income of landlords and also thecorresponding income of owner-occupiers in their capacity as landowners.   It is however becoming increasingly difficult to treat the two aspects separatelybecause over half of all farmers in Great Britain are now owner-occupiers aswell as all those in Northern Ireland.10.   Aggregate net farm income is not directly comparable either with the wages of other classes in the community or with the trading profits of companies.   Onthe one hand it has to cover the reward to farmers for their labour and that oftheir wives both as manual workers and as managers and it has also to provide thereturn on tenant-type assets other than those financed from identifiablecommercial borrowing.   Not all of this represents spendable income, since part(about a tenth in most recent years) represents an increase in the values oramounts of crops and livestock;   though correspondingly there is an increase infarmers&apos; capital.   This appreciation in the value of assets results partly from
general inflation.   It does not improve agriculture&apos;s resources for expansionexcept to the extent that it provides greater   security for borrowing.   Itcannot he realised as long as farmers need these assets to stay in business.On the other hand, in comparing the position of farmers with that of wage and salary earners it could be argued that farmers enjoyed benefits not fullyreflected in the income statistics;   and any comparison of agriculture in general with industry in general must take account of the degree of security afforded to agriculture by present methods of support and by special concessions on taxation and rating as compared with the protection and other indirect and direct supportgiven to industry.11.   Further information about net farm incomes comes from an analysis of samplefarm accounts which are used to compare incomes for farms of different types, sizesand regions.   All farms are treated as tenanted.   The concept of net income thatis used is the same as for the aggregate net income series, except that in the farm accounts no deduction is made for interest payments and depreciation is calculated on historic cost, rather than replacement cost.   The sample covers onlyfarms which should provide full-time occupation for the farmer:   this isparticularly important for Northern Ireland and for Wales, where full-time farmsare actually outnumbered by part-time and sub-viable farms whose incomes are much lower.Trends in net income12.   Weather affected net income very severely in 1960/69 and favourably in1969/70.   Actual aggregate net income which fell from  5165- million in 1967/68 to, 480t million in 1968/69 is expected to rise to  535s million in 1969/70, anincrease of 11-g- per cent.   When adjusted for normal weather, however, the increase is only  1-g- million - a very small increase compared with the upward trend overthe last decade of about  15 million a year.13.   In real terms actual aggregate net income in 1969/70 is forecast to rise by per cent compared with 1968/69 but it will probably still remain below the levelof the previous four years.   Compared with the average of 1964/65-1966/67 it would show a decline of about 4 per cent.5.
CONFIDENTIAL14-.   As already mentioned, trends in farm incomes cannot be compared preciselywith those of other groups.in terms of income per head.   The other groups in the economy most comparable with farmers are &quot;Other sole traders&quot; and &quot;Professionalpersons&quot;.   For both these the trends in aggregate income (whether gross or net)since 1964.-66 have been about the same as the trend in aggregate farm income, but before 1964 there was a rather slower rise in aggregate farm income.   Although the gross trading profits of manufacturing companies are not directly comparable,aggregate farm income does represent in part the trading profit of the industryand it may be noted that the gross trading profits of manufacturing companies have risen less rapidly and have fallen as a ratio of capital assets.15.   The number of full-time farmers is slowly declining and, adjusted for this,aggregate gross income indicates an increase in income per farm of about l  percent a year in real terms since 1964/67 and aggregate net income after allowing for depreciation indicates an increase of only about 1 per cent.   The sample of individual farm accounts indicates an annual decline of about   per cent in realnet incomes in the same period.   The annual rate of increase in total personalincome per head for the whole economy has been about      - 2 per cent.   It is notpossible to express the incomes of &quot;Other sole traders&quot; and &quot;Professional persons&quot;as averages per head, nor can gross manufacturing profits be adjusted in this way.However real incomes per head of wage-earners in manufacturing industry and thoseof salaried employees have been increasing by about 2 per cent a year.16.   The aggregate value of tenant-type assets has gone up steadily in recent yearsand in 1969/70 is forecast to have risen by a quarter above the average level of1962/63 - 1964/65.   This increase of 4 per cent a year is due partly to capitalappreciation on existing assets and partly to an increased volume of assets.   Thecapital appreciation element is estimated to be about 3 per cent a year.   Landprices have also been going up by about 10 per cent a year until recently, though they fell in 1969.   The rise came to a small extent from an increased volume of investment in buildings and works and mainly from capital appreciation whichitself was due in part to non-agricultural factors.   This rise is reflected to alarge extent in the increase in rents charged to farmers as tenants in theaggregate net income calculation.   Forms of personal wealth and assets owned byother sections of the community have of course also appreciated in value.6.
17.   The rate of return on capital invested in agriculture cannot be estimatedprecisely in absolute terms.   However, for the rate of return on tenant-typeassets to remain constant over the years the residual profits element ofaggregate net income would have to increase at the same rate as total assets.In fact aggregate net income before deducting the interest charge on commercialborrowing has risen by rather less and this represents either a slightly slowerincrease in the reward for farmers&apos; labour or a small fall in the rate of return on assets in line with the trend in manufacturing industry.Incomes by size and type of farm and by region18.   The latest information from the sample farm accounts is for 1968/69, whichwasa poor farming year in England, a better one in Wales and Scotland and a good one in Northern Ireland. The actual average incomes for all types and sizes of full-time farm were  1,849 for England and Wales (excluding farms requiring over 15 men) 1,785 for Scotland and  1,685 for Northern Ireland but these averages concealwide variations, mainly according to the size of farm. The two extremes are both found oncereals farms in England and Wales, with average incomes of only  707 on 1-2 manfarms and average incomes of  8,000 on the 4-15 man farms.   On the 1-2 man farmswhich produce about 20 per cent of total output average incomes are in general in the range  800 -  1,400.   On the 2-4 man farms which produce a quarter of total output they are in general in the range  1,300 -  2,500j   and on the 4-15 manfarms, accounting for about a third of total output they range from  2,500 up to 8,000.   After deducting interest on debt and the increase in valuations, the cash incomes which farmers would have to spend on paying tax, living, and expanding and improving their capital stock would of course be considerably less,the difference being in the order of  250 -  500 in the case of the 2-4 man farms.
19.   As there is no external yardstick against which to assess the value ofthe labour of the farmer and his wife and of his managerial skills, it is notpossible to say what proportion of net income represents the reward for these functions and what proportion is left to provide the return on the capital invested in the business.   It is consequently difficult to make a comparisonin absolute terms between the rates of return in agriculture and in industry generally. Such a comparison would in any case be misleading if no account were taken of relative rates of capital appreciation, and in particular of the more rapid appreciation in the value of land which may make an owner-occupier readierto accept a relatively low rate of return on his farming activities.   when considering the implications for expansion in agriculture it is also necessaryto remember that the rate of return which a farmer will look for will varygreatly depending upon such factors as his indebtedness and whether the farmis his livelihood or an investment.   Nevertheless a relatively low rate of return coupled with a high rate of interest on borrowed capital will deter afarmer from investing capital for further expansion.20.   The incomes shown in para. 18 can however be related to the amounts oftenants1 capital invested in the farm:   about  3,500 to  5,500 for 1-2 man farmsabout  7,500 to  12,500 for 2-4. man farms and about  15,000 to  35,000 for the4-15 man farms.   Average capital stock varies by type of farm and the amountof capital employed on cereal farms in particular is higher than these figures.It appears that the rate of return on this capital in 1968/69 was in generallower than the average return of 14 per cent in manufacturing industry (basedon Board of Trade analyses for 1968).   This is indicated in two ways.   First,8.
9.the overall average net income in each country for all types and sizes of full-time farm can be reduced by an allowance of 14 per cent on the tenant-type assets,or by 7-g- per cent in order to take account of the possible effect on owner-occupiers1 expectations of a relatively fast appreciation on the value of their land.   The average returns which would be left as the imputed earnings ofthe farmer and his wife for their labour are:England and Wales       Scotland       Northern IrelandAllowing 14$return of capital  481  326  1,052Allowing   7i$return on capital  1,123  1,003  1,346(The figures for Northern Ireland are probably too high as the farm accountsthere tend to overstate income and understate tenants&apos; capital).   The second way in which this can be seen is by estimating the proportion of full-time businessesin the whole of the U.K. whose returns would fall below certain income levelsafter making an allowance for return on capital:Proportion of farms with returns ofOver  1.000   Under  800  Under  500   Under  200After allowing MSreturn on capital 31$ 63$ 52$ 40$After allowing 1%%return on capital 47$ 43$ 32$ 22$21.   A further approach is to use the figures for aggregate net farm income and total tenant-type assets.   If the Farmers1 Union&apos;s figure of  1,500 per annum
C 3nrdentialis taken as the average remuneration for the manual and managerial labour of the farmer and his wife,  285 million should then be subtracted from the aggregatenet income of  535i million.   The  250 million which is left gives a return ofabout 10 per cent on the Union&apos;s estimate of the occupier&apos;s equity - some  2,500million.   Whilst this rate is below that for manufacturing generally as notedabove (14 per cent) account must be taken of the capital appreciation on landlordtype assets, at least so far as owner-occupiers are concerned.22.   In England and Wales average incomes for all types of farming taken togetherfell by about 16 per cent between 1967/68 and 1968/69;   cropping farms were the worst affected with an average fall of over 30 per cent.   Wales did better than any of the English regions, showing a marginal increase overall.   In Scotland tooaverage net income was unchanged, although there were considerable variationsbetween types.   In Northern Ireland, which had an exceptionally good year incomesrose by 17 per cent overall, indicating a recovery from the low levels to whichthey had fallen in the mid 1960s, with dairy farms showing the highest increase,although the whole of the increase was represented by higher stock valuationsrather than as cash income.23.   In 1969/70 net incomes on all types of farming taken together in Englandand Wales are expected to recover to about their 1967/68 level.   This increase will not restore the position in real terms as in 1968/69 the overall average for all types and sizes of farm was at its lowest level since before 1963.In Scotland average incomes are expected to rise overall by about 10 per cent over the 1968/69 level but in Northern Ireland little change is expected.10.
24.   In the context of the selective expansion programme it is important to note that during the 1960s the trend has been for cropping farms to increase theirincomes less than livestock farms, particularly beef producers.   Although incomeson cropping farms were originally above average partly due to their larger size,the effect of this trend has been that their incomes are now about average, whensome account is taken of their much heavier capitalisation.Credit25.   Banks have instructions to treat agriculture as a priority borrower and total bank lending to agriculture is expected to increase from  526 million in1968/69 to  533 million in 1969/70.   Banks have, however, been pressing farmers to repay medium and long term loans and bank credit for landlord-type purposes hasbeen reduced in favour of such tenant-type investment as livestock and crops.Of the other sources of credit available farmers have secured more merchants&apos;credit by delaying payment, despite higher charges.   Hire purchase debt has alsogone up slightly.   No information is available on loans from private sources but because of the general credit squeeze it seems likely that these will not haveincreased.   The average interest charge on bank loans is between 9&quot;2 per cent and10-g- per cent.   Agricultural merchants have also increased their charges and loans from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation now cost 10^ per cent.Capital formation26.   Total capital formation in agriculture is now running at about  283 million per annum.   This comprises new buildings and works, plant, machirery and vehicles,and stocks (mainly growing crops and cultivations and livestock).   The level ofcapital formation has risen each year since 1966, end increased by  25 millionbetween 1968 and 1969.   Because of higher costs the rise in real terms is smaller.In particular, out of the extra  70 million invested in stocks in 1969 about 43 million or some two-thirds represented greater expenditure to maintain thesame volume of crops and livestock.:J;4-..;.:;:;;;-&apos;:L,;;\ ; -.:&amp;^]\11.
CONFIDENTIAL27,   Some  186 million was invested in such tenant-type assets as new machinery and livestock.   About  8i; million of this was met from investment incentive grants.About  33 million was financed from the banks, as they switched their credit fromlong and medium to short-term purchases, and to a small extent from the A.M.C. andhire-purchase finance houses.   The remainder was met from the depreciationprovisions of  122 million allowed in the calculation of net income and fromnet income itself after deduction of tax and living expenses.   Farmers&apos;investment to expand their businesses can be regarded as the residualelement of net income, so that proportionately the amount available from net income for extra investment wil? fluctuate much more than any fluctuations innet income as a whole.   In addition the depreciation provision, although so large,does not vary as much in absolute terms as bank advances and net income, which are particularly important at the margin.23,   Total spending on plant, machinery and vehicles fell by 6-g- per cent in 1969compared with 196S and the quarter-by-quarter figures do not indicate any recovery,this decline is about 10 per cent in real terras.29.   Some  97 million was invested in buildings and works in 1969.   This is a landlord-type responsibility and as such is not among the matters normally examined at the Review.   But some account must be taken of this element, as the profit-ability of farming will affect trends in this investment which in turn affect the ability of farmers to expand their production.   Of the  97 million, about 34 million was met out of capital grants such as the Farm Improvement Scheme and about  7 million from Agricultural Mortgage Corporation type loans.    little creditis currently available from the banks for buildings and works.   The: largest source of finance is landlords1 net rents (half of which represents imputed rents for owner-occupied farms).   After deducting  65 million for maintenance costs, ratesand statutory charges and  28 million for identifiable interest from the grossrents of  145 million, net rents amounted to about  50 million, before allowing for taxes on income, living expenses, and any depreciation provisions.M    12.
CONFIDENTIAL30.   Expenditure on new buildings and works rose by some 13 pf-r cent in 1969 butthis represents mainly the completion of projects planned some time before.   Thenumber of applications received under the Farm Improvement Scheme (which givessome indication of investment intentions) fell by some 8 per cent:   this suggestsa fall in actual construction in 1970.31,   In 1967/68 aggregate net income was exceptionally high and this may wellaccount in p-irt for the substantial increase in machinery investment in 1968 andfcr the increase in buildings investment in 1969.   But the trends in investmentnow suggest that there may be a shortage of funds for this purpose.   Alreadythere has been a fall in investment in plant and machinery.   There are also signsof a turn-down in investment in buildings and works, though here the effectswould be delayed because most building investment is planned up to a year or soahe-;.d.   Farmers&apos; resources have been affected by the relatively slow growth intheir average real income in recent years and on arable farms which are particularly heavily capitalised real incomes are substantially below the levelof the mid-sixties.   The effect of the sharp drop in incomes in 1966/69 now seems to be showing itself in investment.   In addition although there has been an adequate supply of bank credit for working capital, little credit is currently available for longer-term investment.   Farmers may also have beendeterred by the higher cost of credit.COMMODITY PROSPECTS32.   The development of production in relation to the objectives under the selective expansion programme was set out in the first report to Ministers.   Theprovisional results of the December census for England, Wales and Scotland whichhave since beoome available broadly confirm previous forecasts but show a fasterincrease in the beef herd than expected, offset by a check in the expansion of the dairy herd; show a sharper fall in the sheep breeding flock; and suggest some further expansion of the pig breeding herd.   A note on the main changes is attachedat Appendix A.&apos;   13.
33.   An assessment of the technical possibilities of reaching the objectives of the programme was set out in para. 9 of the first report to Ministers.   the modifications due to the census results give further ground   for believing thatthe objectives for pigmeat remain attainable, suggest that more attention needs to be paid to restoring progress in the cattle sector if expansion of beef is to match the objective in full, and underline the need for an early check in thedecline of the breeding flock if the objective for sheep is to be achieved by1972/73.
VIEWS OF THE FARMERS1 UNIONS34.   The Farmers1 Unions have come to the Review against a background ofwide-spread agitation among the farming community.   Moreover they have taken the unusual step of announcing in advance their objectives at the Review. Their&quot;four-point plan&quot; seeks an increase in net far:-.1 income to  650 million in 1970/71;full recoupment of costs at the 1970 Review and an assurance of full recoupment atthe 1971 and 1972 Reviews; and increased regulation of imports (the fourth point was that the Unions should seek support for their claim from other section? of thecommunity).   It is not entirely clear how far their leaders themselves feel thatthey are committed to the details of their plan or how far they may have room for manoeuvre in the light of their published objectives.     It seems reasonablehowever to suppose that there will be a considerable gap between what they arelikely to hold out for and what officials feel able to recommend.35.   They have presented their case on two broad grounds.   The first has the elements of a pay claim.   This stresses income and for that reason is the approach which gets the strongest support from farmers generally,   rioting the increases in prices authorised by the Government for other industries and thehigher pay claimed by other sections of the community they have demanded fairtreatment for themselves.   They have complained about the effects of inflation,which they say has worsened their position in real terms and is likely tocontinue to do so - hence their aim to get an assurance of full cost recoupmentfor the out three years.   In addition after comparing the trends in farm incomes and their return on capital with other sectors they have claimed that they were doing less well than the rest of the community and were in many cases receivingcompletely inadequate returns.   They have accordingly suggested that it would be reasonable to assume an average income of  1,500 per annum for the manual andmanagerial labour of the farmer and hi3 wife on each of the 200,000*full-timefarm businesses in the U.K. and also to allow a 15 per cent return on an estimated  2,250 -  2,500 million worth of occupiers1 assets:   thus they arriveThe latest estimate of the number of full-time businesses is in fact 190,000.15.
at their target of a minimum of  650 million for the aggregate net income ofthe whole industry (excluding part-time farms).36.   Their second approach - the one favoured by their leaders - has been to emphasize the need to meet the objectives of the selective expansion programme.They have agreed that expansion has been uneven but have suggested that progressoverall has been disappointing since, though it is still too early to passjudgment there has in the first two years of the extended programme (1967/68 to1969/70) been no net increase in output. They have said that they believe that,given the resources and reasonable market stability, attainment of the programme is well within the capacity of the industry.   Whilst recognising the effects ofweather and the foot-and-mouth epidemic they have attributed the slow progress to date primarily to the industry&apos;s lack of resources to meet both cost inflation and an increase in the volume of investment.37.   Much of their argument has centred around ths trends in investment.   Theyhave claimed that in the first two years of the extended programme, and after a prolonged period of cost-price squeeze, the volume of investment althoughhigher in monetary terms has fallen short of the needs postulated by the objectives.   They have suggested that much of the recent increase in grosscapital formation has simply reflected a rise in the price of the capital assetsconcerned.   They have asserted that many large and efficient farmers are introuble because of their heavy capitalisation and the burden of high interest charges, while it is these farmers who must be expected to contribute most toexpansion.   The Unions consider that the industry is capable of further rises in productivity but only on condition that additional resource;- are ploughed infor investment purposes and that without a major injection of resources throughthe price schedule investment will continue to be restricted and expansion will suffer.16.
38.   Investment is one of three.subjects which have been given particularprominence this year.   The Farmers&apos; Unions have provided details of aspecial survey of farmers&apos; investment plans which showed that in 1969 manyfarmers had spent less than intended on investment and for 1970 nearly as many farmers were planning to spend less as to spend more.   They have also said that there are signs of deterioration in the land stemming from farmers&apos; inability for economic reasons to undertake certain husbandryoperations and maintenance work and that these &quot;hidden costs&quot; are anaccumulating liability not reflected in the statistics that are collected.Finally, they have suggested that the increase in land values over the last decade has been due not to the profitability of farming but to competingdemands from non-agricultural users and to a lesser extent to the willingness of farmers to bid up prices in order to add adjacent land to their farms.39.   The Unions have argued for a more effective regulation of imports and fora greater degree of market management both in the interests of stability andin order that producers can progressively earn a higher proportion of an increasing total return from the market.   In particular they have urged that thenew stabilisation scheme for beef and the new minimum import price scheme foreggs must be effective and that more regulation of imports of milk productsshould be introduced.4-0.   The Unions have stressed their belief in the importance of expansion on two grounds.   First, they have maintained that in the context of entry into theE.E.C. the nation needs more rather than less production in order to reduce the undoubted balance of payments burden which would arise from our adoption of thecommon agricultural policy.   Second, they have suggested that a policy ofagricultural expansion could help to consolidate the recent improvement in thebalance of payments and, by permitting some relaxation of fiscal and monetarymeasures in the economy generally, permit a rather greater rate of economic growth than we have been aecustomed to in recent years.   They have suggested that additional resources put into agriculture are likely to be spent on additionalinvestment provided that farmers are assured that in the long run   they will notbe let down and that room will be found in their own market for the additionaloutput.17.
18.41.   The Farmers&apos; Unions have not, at this stage, disclosed precisely whataward they are seeking but they have indicated that they consider that commodityprice increases across the board are required with incentive payments aboverecoupment of costs for various commodities.   In addition they have indicated that in their view the rate of some production grants (notably fertilisers andlime) should be raised.   The two approaches adopted by the Unions cannot be wholly separated.   They have emphasized that in the end both their claims - for higher pay and for capital for investment - come together as a need for increasedincome to get cash into the industry.   They have accordingly laid down threerequirements which they consider must be satisfied - their need for cash now,for confidence in the future and for greater protection against imports.
CONFIDENTIALEXAMINATION OF RELEVANT DATA - GENERAL CONCLUSIONS42.   Any broad generalisations must be qualified because the position on particular farms can vary widely according to their size, type and location.Moreover the farmer who is concerned primarily with the livelihood from hisfarm as a business is in a different position from the businessman who for a variety of reasons may invest part of his wealth in farm land.   Subject tothese reservations, our general appreciation of what has been happening inBritish agriculture for the past two years is as follows.43.   In 1968/69, which came after a good year for farming, there was a sharpdrop in net output and net farm income, particularly on cereal farms inEngland, though income continued to rise in Northern Ireland and to a lesser extent in Scotland and Wales.   At last year&apos;s Annual Review, Ministers took account of the indications then available of this situation.   At the same time,in the expectation that more normal conditions would apply in 1969/70 so that output would resume its previous upward trend and the normally expectedproductivity gain reassert itself, they considered that farm income would be restored to an appropriate level by changes in the guarantees that in totalamounted to less than the additional costs falling on the industry.44.   In the event, after a poor spring in some parts of the country, theseexpectations have been broadly realised in 1969/70.   Net output is back to the1967/68 level overall, and net income as calculated by the agricultural departments is higher, in money terms, than in 1967/68.   There are neverthelessa number of reasons why, even with this improvement farmers regard the positionas unsatisfactory, particularly in view of the fact that expansion is expected of them under the Government&apos;s programme.   First, there has probably been atime lag in the impact of last year&apos;s fall in incomes, while this year&apos;simprovement has still to be fully appreciated.   Second, in real as opposed tomoney terms and disregarding the drop in income a year ago, farmers, in common with the general run of businesses, have failed to improve their income positionover the past couple of years.   One factor in the sluggishness of net farm&apos;    19.
CONFIDENTIALincome, in a period when costs have been rising, is that each Annual Reviewtakes into account only to a limited extent the possible further cost increases in the coming year.   In the nature of things this factor tends to loomincreasingly large in farmers&apos; minds as the next Review approaches - though itis, of course, a factor subsumed in the trend in incomes to which we havealready referred.   Similarly the high cost of credit has been allowed for beforestriking the net income figures, though the individual farmer will not be reconciled to it on that account and may be less ready to invest knowing thathe has to face higher interest payments.45.   So far as we can establish, these factors provide the background to thepresent agitation in the industry - the delayed reaction to the bad year in1968/69, and the fact that the recovery in 1969/70 has still to be felt in fulland will even then do little more than restore the level of farm incomes in money terms without making good last year&apos;s inroads into farmers&apos; resources.To many farmers, the whole issue presents itself in simple form - the need to get more pay, at a time when other sections of the community are pressingsimilar demands.   The more thoughtful among them, however, base their caserather on the requirements of the selective expansion programme propounded bythe Government itself.   It is primarily from this point of view that it seemsright to us, as officials, to form a judgment of what the situation requires inorder to sustain output and to provide for further expansion - provided,of course, that the amounts required in terms of resources and support arereasonable in relation to the import saving secured.   Therefore one of the considerations which has played a large part in our approach is that themeasures adopted at this juncture should be designed, so far as is possible,to encourage - whether directly by their incentive effect or indirectly by their effect on the farmers&apos; cash position - continued investment such as isnecessary both for expansion and for continued adoption of improved equipment and technology and to offset the decline in the labour force.20.
mmmimz CONF.DENT.al46,   The action, which in our view would be appropriate in the light of this analysis of the economic condition and prospects of the industry, falls under twoheads - the commodity determinations and other measures.Commodity determinations47.   The underlying policy on the basis of which Ministers decided upon thepresent selective expansion programme was that this should be conditional on a continued rise in productivity, the benefits of which should accrue in part tothe farmer and in part to the nation, through helping to keep support costs down.Whatever special consideration may have to be taken into account this year, thereis no Departmental proposal to reverse this underlying policy decision.48.   Vvre have therefore considered in the first instance what commoditydeterminations would be appropriate in pursuance of this policy.   Against the highercosts of  60 million falling on guaranteed commodities but talcing account also ofthe gain from greater efficiency that may be expected if output increases, we propose commodity determinations which, net, would increase the value of the guarantees by  52 million.    Given the gain from greater efficiency that may beexpected if output increases, this should enable the industry to secure animprovement of net income.   Moreover, a substantial part of the cost increasesrelate to egg production but, because the egg subsidy is being phased out, theegg producer.&quot; will not get their share of cost reimbursement under this award;thus other producers will get correspondingly more.   The proposed commoditydeterminations therefore represent a relatively favourable application of the basic policy.1\49.   We suggest that, as last year,   the determinations should continue to put the main emphasis on the commodities of special priority in the Government&apos;sselective expansion programme, namely beef, pigmeat and cereals.    In accordance withannounced policy, the guarantee on eggs should be reduced to the maximum extentpermissible under agricultural legislation.   Although sheep production is not aPriority under the programme, the decline in sheep numbers, to which we drew21.
C . I 3F1DENTIALattention in our first report, has gone farther than expeoted.   We have accordingly suggested a price increase of a little more than the increased costs falling on this sector of farming.   It is not Government policy to increasemilk production for its own sake; but the dairy herd, expansion of which wereported in our first report as coming to an end, has now actually started to decline.   We therefore propose an increase in the price of milk about the sameas the cost increase.   The higher price takes account of the increased supplyof calves originating in the dairy herd that are being kept for beef (see para. 2of Annex B) and the increase in the guarantee also reflects the rise in liquid milk consumption.50.   In addition we propose a new incentive to encourage farmers to go ahead with brucellosis eradication.   This would take the form of a bonus payment on milk from brucellosis-free dairy herds with an equivalent payment on brucellosis-free beef herds.   Although the bonus payment will increase the return whichowners of brucellosis-free herds will get for their milk the effect of the new arrangement will not be to encourage an increase in milk production as such but rather an increase in the proportion of the milk supply that comes from cleanherds.   The bonus will be treated separately from the basic milk price but will of course be counted as part of the Review award and is included in the totalof  52 million mentioned in para 48.   The proposals will help to deal with the growing public concern over brucellosis on the grounds both of animal health and ofpublic health.   The cost of the measures taken will grow in future years but therewould also be an increase if we were to continue with the existing arrangements.Details of the proposed arrangements are given in Annex C.51.   Other things being equal the effect of the proposed changes on milk taken together would be to increase the price of milk to the consumer by Id. per pintfor about three months of the year.   However, as a result of decimalisation itwill probably be necessary for the retail milk price to go up in any case from 11d.to 1s. Od. from 1st January 1971.   This would have left a considerable surplus inthe milk fund, by means of which consumer payments are evened out so that over theyears there is no overpayment or underpayment of the guarantee.     This surplus
would accomiriodate much of the increase in the producer price proposed above andthe whole of the increase can be met while leaving the milk fund broadly in balanceby increasing the retail price to Is. Od. from 1st December 1970, so that in1970/71 it would stand at lid. for eight months and Is. Od. for four months.52.  We believe that the biggest impact will be secured by concentrating funds oncoGmodity end-prices.   We are therefore not suggesting any changes in the livestockproduction grants except for the bonus payments just mentioned for brucellosis-free beef herds which would be paid via the existing hill cow and beef cow subsidies,ffe propose however that the grant to small farm businesses should be discontinued onexpiration of the Small Farm (Business Management) Scheme in August.   This scheme hasnow largely fulfilled its purpose, and the number of applications for grant under ithas fallen to a level that no longer justifies keeping it in being.53.   Details of these recommended commodity determinations are given in Annex B,%.   Although the value of these commodity determinations for the purpose of the review award would be  52 million, they would represent an additional Exchequercommitment in a full year of some  32 million.   This is because the cost of support for milk and sugar does not fall on the Exchequer, and because other savings arisewhere price increases nominally falling on the Exchequer are offset to some extent in other ways.   The full year effect will not be felt in 1970/71 mainly because the increases in the cereals guarantees do not come into effect until July and payment to farmers on the basis of those higher prices will not be completed until thefollowing financial year.   The effect in 1970/71 is estimated at just under 25 million.Further measures       &apos;v55.   We have also considered whether these proposed commodity determinations shouldbe supplemented by further special measures designed to deal with the problemsidentified in our examination of the relevant data and summarised in paragraph 42 to45 above.   It is important that nothing should be done which could be representedeither as conceding the claim which the farmers have now put in that they should beallowed to retain the full gain from their increased productivity in the next fewyears;   or as implying that the Government have framed their determinations with a viewto meeting a pay claim rather than in relation to the needs of continued selective expansion.
*.....res ir-;;-a A I56.   We have concluded that in^reseht circumstances there is a good case for thefurther specific measures set out below on the basis - for which the Treasury andthe Agricultural Departments have obtained prior approval from their Ministers -that these are to be treated, in conjunction with the commodity award set out above,as a firm package which sets the limits within which subsequent negotiations shouldtake place.57.   The supplementary proposals are two-fold.(a) a one-year increase in the rate of subsidy on fertiliserand lime, so as to inject an additional   10 million of whichrather less than   8 million would be spent in 1970-71.(b) a two-year increase in the rates of capital grants for agriculture, designed to inject about   10 million extra ineach of two years.   The amount spent in 1970-71 would dependon the particular method adopted for introducing the higher rates of grant.   The two possible variants are described in greater detail in Annex D.   The first, which would to someextent involve payment on work already approved, would enablecash to flow sooner and for that reason would be more costly tothe Exchequer in the first year.   The second variant, underwhich payments would be made only on new projects,   would costless in the first year but some payments would carry over intoa third year, and the cost over the whole period would be rathergreater.   Officials consider that the second alternative -subject to confirmation by Ministers - is to be preferred becausethe money would be spent only on new investment projects and so would be used to best effect.58.   The cost of both these measures falls wholly on the Exchequer.   The increasein the fertiliser and lime subsidies would be presented as an addition to   the review determinations, in effect bringing the total to  62 million.   The increase
in capital grants falls outside the normal run of Review determinations.   Butit would represent a further addition to agricultural support as a whole.   Itwould be presented to Parliament, the farmers and the public as increasingthe value of the whole package by a further  20 million over the period.   in presenting the package it would be made clear that this year the Governmentis allowing the farmers to retain the whole of the efficiency gain with a littleon top as a special injection of money for expansion;   but the selective expansion programme, taking one year with another, would continue to be basedon increasing productivity which should contribute to meeting cost increases and so to keeping down the cost of support in real terms.Public Expenditure59.   The total addition to public expenditure resulting from the whole packagewould be as follows:- n  million1270=71        i2ZlzZ2        1972-7?Commodity determinations        24*8 32.1 32.1Exchequer elementOne-year increase in rateof fertiliser subsidy 7.8 2.increase in rates ofcapital grantsMethod (a) 10.25 9.0Supplement forintensives 0.75 0.1Method (b) 5.5 9.5 5.8Supplement^ forintensives 0.75 0.1Brucellosis (additional expenditure over 1969 public expenditure Provision) 0.5 1.35 1.660.   As explained in paragraphs14-16 of our first report to which reference should be made for a detailed explanation of the treatment of agricultural support in the public expenditure figures, the present Estimates of the cost25.
of agricultural support in 1970-71 before taking account of the present proposalsfall short of the projections for 1970-71 and 1971-72 in the Public expenditure white Paper by  28 million.   Thus these proposals would take up the shortfall andin addition entail a demand of some  11-g million on the contingency reserve in1970/71 and some  17 million in 1971/72 subject to a decision confirming the recommended method of paying the capital grant.CONCLUSION61.   It would be unrealistic to suppose that agreement with the farmers, howeverdesirable it might be, is possible if their leaders continue to demand price increases of the size mentioned in earlier statements by their organisations.Indeed, it would be difficult to justify continuing with an agriculturalexpansion programme if the cost of getting it approached some of the figures that have recently been bandied about.   The proposals we have made give   the farmersa fair prospect of improving their incomes by increasing their output, and provide positive help towards this by improving their liquidity and directlyaiding their investment.   We believe that our proposals are consistent with thebasis on which the Government decided to go ahead with the programme of selective expansion, that they recognise and provide a reasonable solution to the diffi-culties with which farmers are at the present faced, and that they should enablethe industry to keep on an expansion course towards the import saving objectives which the Government originally had in mind and which would additionallystrengthen our position in the event of accession to the E.E.C.   The approach wehave recommended has the further advantage that it can be presented as flowingfrom a realistic analysis of the current position of the industry instead of appearing as a rather pallid attempt to match, on their terms, the bid thatthe farmers have put in.62.   Ministers are accordingly invited to agree(a)   To commodity determinations as recommended, increasing the valueof the guarantees by  52 million.26.
(b) to a temporary increase in the fertiliser and lime subsidiesby  10 million for one year;   and(c) to increases in the rates of capital grants for two yearsamounting to some  20 million over the period;to confirm whether, of the two methods suggested in Annex D for handling thecapital grants, they prefer the one recommended by officials;and to authorise the Agricultural Ministers to conduct subsequent discussions with the farmers, which are due to begin next week, on that basis.27.
CONFIDENTIAL MNEX AAssessment of the provisional results of the December census1,    The first report to Ministers indicated for the dairy herd a declining rateof expansion in the year to June 1970 and no increase from then to June 1971;for the beef herd, on the other hand, increases of some 50,000 in each of the twoyears were forecast.   Preliminary examination of the December census results for england, Wales and Scotland, however, suggests that whereas the check to theexpansion of the dairy herd has occurred rather sooner than anticipated, the beefherd now seems likely to expand slightly faster than previously predicted.   Theeffect of the revised projections on home-produced beef supplies both in 1969/70and 1970/71 is likely to be marginal, but milk sales may now be only some40 million gallons greater in 1969/70 than in 1968/69 (compared with the previousforecast increase of 50 million gallons), and there may be no further rise in1970/71 (although previously an increase of 40 million gallons over 1969/70 was expected).2.    The sheep breeding flock at December ha3 declined by rather more than expected and the 1970 lamb crop will reflect this unless the season is exceptionallyfavourable.   Home-produced mutton and lamb supplies in 1969/70 will be affectedonly marginally, but in 1970/71 they are likely to be no more than in 1969/70.3.    The pig breeding herd at December 1969 is some 8,000  head greater than expected and if the welcome upturn in the number of gilts in pig is maintained thenat June 1970 the herd could be some 20,000 - 25,000 head greater than at June 1969.The increase previously forecast in home produced pigmeat supplies in 1969/70(over 50,000 tons above the 1968/69 level) will not be affected significantly,but in 1970/71 production of pigmeat should now show an increase of over 20,000tons above the level of 1969/70 instead of the no change position previouslyseen.
REG recommendations ON THE GUARANTEESReef and milk1.    Beef is one of the priority commodities under the selective expansion programme.   Attainment of the objectives depends upon (a) expansion in the beefherd, which is going ahead well;    (b) expansion in the dairy herd, which hasrecently been checked;   and (c) the level of calf retentions, which is at presentencouraging.   Because of its relatively long production cycle it is particularly important to keep expansion moving ahead early in the programme.   A faster increasein the total breeding herd is needed and the relative profitability of beef asagainst milk must be broadly maintained.     It is therefore recommended that the guaranteed price should be increased by 10s. Od. to 225s. Od., which would rather more than offset the estimated increase of 8s. 9d. in factor costs.2.    Accepted policy is not to encourage increased milk production for its own sakebut the dairy herd makes a major contribution to beef output.   It is essential to arrest the present downward trend in the dairy herd and to get a resumption ofan upward trend to keep on course to the beef objective.   In making the pricedetermination on milk, regard has to be taken of the &quot;dilution assurance11 underwhich the effect on the average producer price of an increase in milk productionresulting from the increased contribution to beef output from the dairy herd is tobe taken into account.   The amount to be taken into account under the assurancethis year is equivalent to 0.4-6d. per gallon on ths guaranteed price.   Thestandard quantities also fall to be increased by 24*0 million gallons on accountof the increase in liquid sales.   We recommend that the guaranteed price should beincreased by 1.23d, to 46.49d. per gallon.   This figure includes the effects ofthe &quot;dilution assurance&quot;.   The automatic adjustment of the standard quantitiesis worth a further 0.27d. so that overall the award is rather higher than ttnincrease of 1.17d. in   factor costs.   This award does not include the bonus for milk from brucellosis-free dairy herds which is recommended in Annex C.1.
Sheep and wool3.    Although sheep production is not a priority under the programme, the objective is to restore production of mutton and lamb in 1972/73 to its 1967/68level.   The breeding flock has been declining more rapidly than expected.   Theincrease in production costs is put at 2.3d. per lb. for fat sheep and 2.8d. per lb.. for wool (together equivalent to nearly 3d. per lb. for fat sheep).   no increase in the guaranteed price of wool is recommended, in view of the relatively high rate of unit subsidy, but in order to avert the run-down insheep production and give confidence to its future an increase of 3d. to3s. 10fd. per lb. is recommended in the guaranteed price for fat sheep.Figs4.    Pigmeat is one of the priority commodities.   The aim is to continue thepresent steady expansion of the breeding herd.   The factor cost increase isevaluated at 10.3d. per score.   In order that producers may see that their effective return will not be reduced in future as production rises in line withthe objectives, it is recommended that the &quot;middle band&quot; (which represents broadly the level of production which the Government would like to see) should be raisednow by 300,000 pigs to a new level of 13.2 - 14*6 million pigs.   It is also recommended that the basic guaranteed price should be increased by 10d. per scoreto 49s. 3d. per score.Eggs5.    The objective is to remain broadly self-sufficient and this is being achieved.Ministers have already decided that the egg subsidy should be put on a flat ratebasis from 1970/71 and to do this it will be necessary to end the profit and losssharing arrangements at this Review.   As a consequence of the prospectiveintroduction of a minimum import price scheme it is recommended that thearrangements should be ended whereby guarantee payments are increased when importsrise above a certain level.2.
Finally it is recommended that, in order to continue the phasing out of thesubsidy, as planned, the maximum cuts should be made in the guaranteed prices.This would reduce that for hen eggs by 1.43d. to 3s. 4*64^. Pe^ dozen and thatfor duck eggs by 2.3ld. to 2s. 2.76d. per dozen.   The increased costs falling on egg producers are assessed at some  9 million in aggregate and no part of thiswill be made good to them.Cereals6,    Wheat and barley are priority commodities and the objective is expansion-tothe full extent technically feasible.   Output and incomes of cereals growers were seriously reduced by the bad weather of a year ago and total production in 1970is expected to be at much the same level as in 1967.   It is important to getprogress in the cereal sector moving forward again.   Cost increases are put at10d. per cwt. for wheat and 9d. for barley.   It is recommended that the guaranteed price for wheat should be increased by 1s. 6d. to 303. 6d. per cwt. (therebyincreasing the price differential in favour of wheat which offers the biggest scope for import saving) and that of barley by 1s. Od. to 27s. Od. p-r cwt.   Oats are nowrelatively expensive in subsidy terms.   The increase in production costs is put atlid. per cwt. but it is recommended that there should be no change in the guaranteed price which would then remain at 27s. 10d. per cwt.7.    The acreage grant on field beans comes to an end in 1970/71.   It is not proposed to extend this grant or to introduce other break crop grants at this time.Potatoes8.    The policy is to maintain self-sufficiency in main crop potatoes except in years of unusually low yields.   The increase in costs is put at 13s. 9d. per ton.It is necessary to set the guaranteed price at a level to give farmers a sufficientassurance of profitability to secure the acreage necessary to maintain self-sufficiency.   It is recommended that the guaranteed price should be increasedby 7s. 6d. to 310s. Od. per ton.3.
Sugar beet9,    The objective is simply to maintain the existing acreage.   As there is noroom in the U.K. market for any increase in committed supplies of sugar (i.e.home production plus Commonwealth quotas) it is recommended that the acreagefor 1971/72 should remain at 443,000 acres.   Costs are estimated to have risen by 6s. 4d. a ton and it is recommended that the guaranteed price should beincreased by 2s. 6d. to 139s. Od. a ton.Production Grants10.   Small Farm (Business Management) Scheme.   This Scheme is due to expire on31st August 1970.   The number of applications under the Scheme continues to falland is now at a very low level.   It is recommended that the Scheme should not be renewed after August this year.&quot;a.4.
CONFIDENTIAL Annex QBRUCELLOSISBackground1,    Brucellosis causes abortion in cattls and undulant fever in humans.   It haslargely been eradicated in Northern Ireland.   In Great Britain measures towardseradication started in 1967 with a voluntary Scheme to register disease-freeherds.   Compensation at full market value up to a maximum of  150 is paid foranimals slaughtered because they react to testing while a herd is becomingdisease-free.   Although this voluntary Scheme has made encouraging progress,there have been setbacks through the reinfection of herds which necessarily involved further compensation before the herds regain their disease-free st-itus.Thus unless a new policy is devised expenditure will in any event increase.2.     There has been a widespread call for more vigorous Government action;   andin particular for early compulsory eradication measures - which would increasethe cost still further if compensation were continued.   Such a step would be premature at this stage.   A sizeable reservoir of brucella-free replacements must first be built up;   moreover a fair proportion of healthy animals are still re-acting to tests because of previous adult vaccination (now discontinued).   However,a pilot scheme of &quot;limited eradication projects&quot; in specially selected areas hasbeen foreshadowed for 1971.Proposals3.    The Annual Review proposals aim to -(a) attract still more of the healthier herds into the presentvoluntary Scheme;   and(b) replace the traditional policy of &quot;compensation&quot; for infected animalsby an &quot;incentive&quot; based on healthy animals, i.e. payment would be by results rather than by reactors.4.    Under these proposals, compensation for slaughtered reactors would cease and,starting from this year &quot;incentive&quot; premiums would be paid on milk from accrediteddairy herds (lid. a gallon) and on the present Hill and Beef Cow subsidies foraccredited beef&apos;herds (37s. 6d. a cow).   This should stimulate interest amongowners of herds having few reactors, and would not disturb the production balance1.
2.between beef and milk.   More heavily infected herds would need to await the compulsory eradication programmes which are being considered separately.5.    The proposals would cost about  3.3 million in 1970/71 rising to  11.million in 1974/75.   Of the total for 1970/71 only some  0.5 million (comprising the beef supplements) would be an Exchequer cost.   The remainder would be embodied in the consumer price of milk and would by itself require an increaseof 1d. per pint in the retail price for about half a month (see para. 51 ofthe report).   By 1974/75 the Exchequer cost would rise to  1.2 million leavingconsumers to bear the remaining  10.0 million.   In addition there would be thecost of administering the new scheme and providing some assistance onreplacements for reactors slaughtered compulsorily, as part of eradicationprojects.   These other costs, which are not part of the guarantee system of support, would rise from  0.9 million in 1970/71 to  2.5 million in 1974/75.6.     The proposals should minimise the long-term Exchequer cost of eradicatingbrucellosis from the national herd with its consequent benefits to those sections of the community which are most at risk.
1.annex DINCREASING THE RATES OF CAPITAL GRANTS1.    This Annex deals with the arrangements for implementing the recommendation that the rates of the capital grants to agriculture should be increased by tenpercentage points for a period of two years.Farm Capital Grant Scheme2.    The existing capital grants to agriculture are to be replaced on 1 October1970 by a unified Farm Capital Grant Scheme (FCGS) made under the powers in thecurrent Agriculture Bill.   The Bill will enable the rates of grant under the new scheme to be prescribed by statutory instrument subject to affirmative resolution procedure.   It was originally envisaged that the FCGS would have a 30 per centbasic rate of grant, with a 50 per cent rate for drainage, improvements to hillland, and remodelling works for farm amalgamations, and with a 10 per centsupplement for drainage in the hills.   There would be no difficulty in raising thetwo main rates so that the statutory instrument would lay down that until the endof the two-year period these rates should be 40 per cent and 60 per cent insteadof the 30 per cent and 50 per cent originally envisaged.&quot;Bridging&quot; operation3.    It is however important to raise the rates of capital grants in the period before the FCGS comes into operation.   This would not only secure a more rapidinjection of capital into the industry, but also avoid the risk that theannouncement of the intention to increase the rates would lead farmers to postponeinvestment until 1 October.   It is therefore proposed to have a &quot;bridging&quot;arrangement to increase the rates of the main capital grants by ten percentagepoints in the period 1 April to 30 September.   This would apply to the grants forfarm and hill land improvements, field drainage, farm water supply (mains) andremodelling, works for farm amalgamations.   No increase is proposed in the ratesof grants (e.g. scrub clearance and ploughing) which are already at or above the levels to be paid under the FCGS or in the grant for tractors and harvesterswhich will terminate when the FCGS comes into operation.
4.    For the agricultural investment grant on fixed equipment, however, which is currently paid at the rate of 10 per cent, a &quot;bridging&quot; increase of 20 percentagepoints is recommended.   Most of this grant is taken up by intensive livestockproducers * who cannot comply with the benefit-to-land requirement of the farm improvement Scheme because their livestock depend mainly on brought-infesdingstuffs (as opposed to feed grown on tb? farm).   Under the FOGS theseproducers would be able to obtain grant at the recommended rate of 40 per cent,r. &quot;bridging&quot; increase of 20 points would raise th-; rate of grant for ttiWseproducers from the present 10 per cent to 30 per cent.   This would avoid too large a gap between the rate payable in the period April to September and the subsequent 40 par cent rate payable under the FOGS for the remainder of thetwo-year period.Alternative criteria for increased rate5.     For the agricultural investment grant, which is not subject to prior approval, tho increased rate would apply to expenditure incurred (i.e. payments made) on or after the qualifying date of 1st April.    ?ov the grants which are subject to prior approval however (farm and hill land improvement, field drainage,vnter supply, remodelling works) there are two possible criteria for determining whether an investment attracts the increased rate.The distribution of the agricultural investment grant by types of enterprisesis as follows:   poultry 58$, pigs 11$, dairying 9$, cropping 8%, livestockrearing 6$, others 8$.2.
CONFIDENTIAL(a)    DATE OF RECEIPT OF GRANT claim under this alternative the increase would be paid on all claims received on or after the qualifying date.  This would inject money quickly,since it would mean paying on work already put in hand and in somecases already completed, and virtually the whole cost of the increase( 20.1 million) is estimated to fall in 1970/71 and 1971/72, as shown below.million1970/71        1971/72General increase of 10 points 10.25 9.further &quot;bridging&quot; increase ofagricultural investment grant on         0.75            0.1fixed equipment to 305&amp;. _       _11.0 9.1(b)   DATE OF DEPARTMENTAL AUTHORITIES TO START work with this criterion the increase would be paid in cases where theDepartmental authorities to start work were given on or after the qualifying date.   On average there is about 12 to 15 months betweenthe issue of authority to start work and the date when the applicantcompletes his project and claims grant.   Under this criterion the money would therefore be injected more gradually and it is estimated thatthe cost, which would be slightly higher ( 21.65 million), would be phased over the three years 1970/71, 1971/72 and 1972/73, as follows:  million1970/71        1971/72      1972/73General increase of 10 points 5.5 9.5 5.8Further &quot;bridging&quot; increase ofagricultural investment grant on 0.75 0.1fixed equipment to6.25 9.6 5.8As mentioned in para. 57 of the main paper officials recommend that alternative(b) is to be preferred since it is ad-rested to new investment rather than towork already in hand or completed and it will therefore be a more effectiveincentive.3.
