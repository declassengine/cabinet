i SE :ret15DOCUMENT IS THE PPvOPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)0:0C(70) 37 COPY NO.2nd March, 1970CABINETSALARIES OF THE HIGHER JUDICIARYMe morandum by the Lord ChancellorMy colleagues will recall that, in summing up our recent discussion about an increase in salary for the higher judiciary, the Prime ministers aid that it could perhaps be agreed in principle that the Judges shouldreceive an increase equivalent to the stage 1 increase which had been givento higher civil servants last July, although it would be inopportune to make an increase in the Judges1 salaries effective at that juncture.    It wassuggested that any opposition to increases might be mitigated if the Judgeswere prepared to agree that their salaries should in future be subject to review by the Special Panel of the Commission for Industry and Manpower(CC(70) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 4).2.      It has now become clear that, although the Scottish Judges would beprepared to agree to their remuneration being subject to review by theSpecial Panel, the English Judges are reluctant to do so.    I do not think this should be held against them, more particularly as it is likely to be another three or four years before the Special Panel can be asked toconsider further salary increases for senior civil servants.    In themeantime, common fairness to the Judges surely requires us to give them the increase which they ought really to have had last year and which is well within the limits of the prices and incomes policy.3.      It was suggested when we last discussed this matter that the degreeof retrospection to be conceded would require further consideration, but Ishould make it plain that there can be no question of retrospective increases for the Judges.    Any increase in their salaries requires to be made by anOrder in Council under the Judges Remuneration Act, 1955 and there is no power to give an Order retrospective effect.    In these circumstances I hopemy colleagues will agree that we ought not to delay any longer In taking thenecessary steps to increase the salaries of the higher judiciary on the linesI proposed in my memorandum (C(70) 6).G.House of Lords, S. W. 1.2nd March, 1970
