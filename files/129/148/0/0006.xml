DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNIv:lENT)C(7Q) 26COPY NOo.10th February,..1970CABINETREPORT BY THE NATIONAL BOARD FOR PRICES AND INCOMES,ON SERVICE pay^S5^S^^ViII2^Z^i?5^e?.:retary cf.State (for Defence^The purpose of this memorandum is to explain why my colleagues should accept the Third Report of the National Board for Prices and incomes (NBPI) concerning the pay of the Armed Forces, while stagingthe introduction of the &quot;Military Salary&quot; over two yearsQ    The background of the Report and a summary of the. main issues it raises are at Annex A0Annex B sets out my undertakings on this subject m the House last June.A breakdown of the costs resulting from fee recommendations of theReport following those of the Second Report which the government accepted in principle last year is at Annex C.    Specimen pay scalesare set out in Annex D0    Annex S contains a proposed draft statement to be made to the House when the NBPI report is published,Zn      I should like to make the following points 2-(a)    We are firmly committed in principle to the introduction with effect from 1st April, 19?0, of a new pay code for the Forces basedupon the Second Report under the Standing Reference to the NBPI oflast year,.    The recommendations in their latest Report fulfil ourexplicit mandate; they are strongly argued on their own merits andare accepted by the Board as being consistent with incomes policy^thus their rejection would destroy confidence in the Board and undermine the credibility of any current or future reference of pays whether in thepublic or private sector, to the. NBPI or to the Commission for Industryand Manpowero    Moreover the field work of collecting job evaluationdata was carried out by officers and men of the three Services underthe direction of the Board and its industrial consultants..    If there were any attempt to tamper with the interpretation of these data in order to suitpreconceptions of what the increases should be, it would rapidly become known.    This in itself would discredit the whole system of reference tothe Board - with disastrous consequences for the Governments proposal that the pay of teachers should be referred to the Board.
(b) Ever since the Standing Reference was made in November, 1967,the Services have been persuaded to accept the abolition of the Griggsystem in expectation of a new deal and a square deal from the Board,as custodian of the Government&apos;s prices and incomes policy and as anindependent arbiter by whose advice the Government intend to be guidedin future,,    We cannot now reject recommendations which flow fromprinciples to which we have publicly committed ourselves without arousingpublic indignation and creating serious discontent among Servicepersonnels the collapse of confidence In the Government would leadto an early manpower crisis hi the Armed Forces and leave us no hopeof finding the necessary number of recruits&apos;.    We know that many officersand men are simply waiting to see whether we are prepared to givepractical effect to the broad principles which we endorsed a year ago0If we do not they will leave and a falling rctte of re-engagement (whichhitherto has held up fairly well) will be added to our external recruitingdifficulties,,    The Forces will then fall fax short of their requirements,not only in total numbers but also in the levels of skill and responsibility on which depend their efficiency.    As 1 warned my colleagues a year ago,the consequences of failure are clear.    Compulsory military service would be the only means of maintaining our promised contributions to NATO, and this would raise military and economic problems quite asformidable as the obvious political difficulties.(c) I could not accept or defend the withholding of the proposed increases on the grounds of possible repercussions elsewhere in thepublic service,,    We should stand publicly convicted of a complete lackof principle.    We overthrew the Grigg system and denied the services in 1968 and 1969 the full increases which would have been forthcomingunder that system, partly on the grounds that the method it used for determing the movement of officers&apos; pay depended on comparisons with the rest of the public service which were quite inappropriate.We deliberately substituted job evaluation techniques and have insisted that it was right to do do,,    We cannot discard the results of applying suchtechniques in order to revert to comparisons of a kind which we havepublicly discarded,30      I have carefully considered the implications of the Board1 srecommendations for the defence budget,     75 million is requiredby the Board1 s recommendation to pay increases on account of job evaluation and their assessment of the !X5 factor, representing 15 percent of the total value of existing Service emoluments in cash or kind,on grounds which they justify as compatible with current incomes policy.Associated improvements in the remaining allowances will add another 5- 7 million; such allowances are not taken account of in calculatingpay increases in civilian or military Iife0    It will also cost  52 million to introduce the new military salary which would remove thediscrimination against single men which has no equivalent in civilian life.    Annex A, paragraph 20, shews that of this total,all but about  23 million can be met in 1970-71, either within thedefence budget target or outside it as a normal pay and price increase.
4.       There would be obvious difficulties in adding  23 million to thedefence budget next year,    I am also conscious that the Board havesuggested in their report that we may wish to consider staging the largerincreases proposed, particularly those required to bring the emolumentsof single men up to married rates.    There are most formidableobjections to any form of staging, both in principle and practice;these are set out in paragraph 21 of Annex A.    Nevertheless, becauseof the Board!s observations and the pressure which has already beenput on the defence programme, 1 accept that we should seek to defend a  measure of staging confined to single men and sufficient to fill thedefence budget gap, since, as the Cabinet agreed last year, I havealready warned the Services that if I could not make all the necessarysacrifices elsewhere in the defence budget some degree of staging mightbe required.    Further staging would be wholly indefensible in the light ofthe considerations in paragraph 2 above.    By carrying out the Board&apos;suggestion in the manner described in paragraph 22 of Annex A, weshould have respected their position as custodians of the Government1 sincomes policy, while minimising the risks to which any form of stagingmust give rise.    Thus single men, while receiving like married men the15 per cent increase arising from job evaluation and the ?X&apos; factor, would achieve full parity with married men only in 1971-72,    The introductionof the military salary would in effect be phased in almost equalproportions over two years,50      At the request of my colleagues on the Ministerial Committeeon Prices and Incomes I have examined the possibility of staging a further 20 million of the total from 1970-71 into 1971-72 so that it might be argued that the total increase in emoluments to the Services as a wholearising from all elements in the NBPI proposals, including the introductionof the military salary, was no higher man 16 per cent.    Two methods of achieving this have been considered - either wholly at the expense of the single men or equally at the expense of single and married men.    Neithermethod is acceptable,(a)    If further sta.ging were wholly at the expense of single men thiswould involve no movement whatever towards parity between marriedand unmarried men;  indeed many single men would actually be receiving a smaller increase than married men, in flat contradiction to the under -taking which I gave on 16th June, 1969, with the Cabinet11 s agreement(see Annex B)c    The real value of a recruit&apos;s total emoluments at present is only  11 11s, 10d, including the value of food and accommodation which he receives in kind.    The NBPI considers that the average earnings which a potential recruit similarly qualified could receive in industry is around 17 a week,    Under my own proposals in paragraph 4 above, a singleman at the point of recruitment would receive  15 Is, Od. a week.Nothing lower in my view would be acceptable to the Sas^SfeS orcompatible with the need for more recruits.
(b)    if the further  20 million of staging were split equally betweenmarried and unmarried men no serviceman or woman would receive the increases justified either by the principle of parity or by the findings ofjob evaluations    Some of the lowest-paid, e0 gc married privates for whomno public quarters are available, would receive increases reduced to no more than 3-7 per cent, and servicemen out of quarters would in generalbe particularly hard bit,,60       Both methods would create a large number of anomalies and hardcases, many of which could not be detected until the pcstbags of ministers and Members of Parliament began to fill.    For example, many men on duty in. Northern Ireland would receive increases lower than their SpecialDuty Pay which is due to terminate on 1st April next,,    In short, thebenefits of the new system of Service pay, on which the Services andthe Government have set so much store., would not be felt for anothertwelve month So    hi the meantime the decline in. recruiting and the collapse in Service morale might well have rendered our existingproblems insuperable,;Recommendations7D      I therefore invite my colleagues:(a) To agree to implement the Board5s recommendation with effect from 1st April next subject to the proposals for staging in paragraph above which are in accordance with the Board&apos;s suggestion^(b) To agree that I should make a statement in the House as at AnnexE on the day when the Board publishes its reportoD.W.H,Ministry of Defence, S.

Second Report of NBPI - the &quot;Military Salary&quot;li.    Last year the Board recommended that Tor the long-term a new pay code should be worked out and introduced with effect from the1st April 1970, under which the discrimination in pay between the married and the single Serviceman would be abandoned and all Service-men regardless of their marital status would receive a common basicsalary subject to tax;   both married and single men would pay quartering or accommodation charges to be deducted at source from- taxed pay.     Single men hitherto provided with food at public expenseI would pay a standard ration charge, though this would be remitted in circumstances specified in the Report.5,    This recommendation was based on the following considerationsr-a. The present combination of pay, allowances anc. benefits in kind is so complicated that it is difficult to convey topotential recruits what their earnings in the Services willbe, or even for Servicemen themselves to calculate what their true earnings are;b. the present system offers the lowest emoluments to singlemen, a category whom the Services are particularly anxiousto recruit;c. in any other walk oL&apos; life it would be regarded as intoler-able to pay men in the same jobs not according to the work done but according to whether they were married or not.In the Services not only has the administration of theexisting system been unsatisfactory, in that there has been no agreed system for the review of marriage allowance, butthere has been a disincentive to enlistment because potentialrecruits cannot understand it;d. civilian pay does not distinguish married men from singlemen;    this function is left to income tax.     Since theServicemen pays income tax in the same way as a civilian,the single man suffers discrimination.The Board&apos;s recommendations last year called for:-a.     the use of job evaluation techniques to obtain data on service and civilian relativities which, together with other factors, would form the basis for a decision on new paylevels within the framework of the &quot;Military Salary&quot; concept.The Board commissioned two firms of management consultantsto work with the Services, the Board and the Civil service department to carry out this task;studies ol&apos; a percentage addition to Service Pay, described as the &quot;X-factor&quot; to compensate for elements in Service lifewhich might withstand any attempt at measurement in relationto standards obtaining outside.     In their latest Report theBoard define these factors as danger, discipline and the lossof personal freedom, the inability to change jobs and the/turbulence-2-CONFIDENTIAL
turbulence that is Inseparable from Service life, withsome element in respect of irregular hours of duty;weighing against these factors a number of advantages,such as adventure, variety, opportunities for travel,sport and recreation and to earn promotion and carry realresponsibility at a young age.7,     Finally the Board last year reviewed additional pay and thoseallowances issued to Servicemen either to compensate them directlyfor expenditure necessarily incurred for Service reasons or for service in especially arduous conditions or in branches calling for particular specialist skills.     The Board&apos;s recommendations in thesematters too were covered by the Government&apos;s broad acceptance inprinciple of last year&apos;e Report.The Latest Report8,     The Government last year accepted in principle the Board1sproposals as a basis for a new structure of Forces&apos; pay, along lines which would make it possible to establish a clear relationship between the emoluments of Servicemen and their civilian counterparts.My statement to the House is at Annex B.     The Services have been assured of our determination to put the new pay code into effect on1st April.9.     In their latest Report the tsoardra. report on the outcome of the job evaluation studies whichthey have turned into recommended pay scales, includingthe &quot;X-factor&quot;;b. for reasons given in Chapter 3 of their Report, recommendthat the Services should follow the policy which theGovernment have applied by statute to local authorities,and make the associated increases in married quartercharges by stapes.     This has the incidental effect of improving the relative position of the lowest paid other ranks.     They have recommended interim rates which they suggest should apply unitl they next review forces pay.Single men, however, will pay full charges for food and accommodation hitherto provided in kind;c. develop in detail their recommendations on additional pay and allowances, based largely on the outcome of direct negotiation and discussion between the Ministry of defence and the Civil Service Department!d. suggest that the Government may wish to consider stagingsome of the larger of the increa:;es proposed, particularly the once-for-all increases required to bring the emolumentsof single men up to married rates.Costs10.   The short term recommendations by the board which we decided toput into effect last year&apos; included the continuous payment of ration allowance to married men, as a step towards the introduction of the&quot;Military Salary&quot;.      ..&apos;e are advised that, even hud the Board not published its latest recommendations, this would have made ration allowance under the existing pay code taxable from 1st April next.We should have had to compensate for this by grossing the rates of
ration allowance for tax at an annual cost of  18M.11,   The pay increases arising from job evaluation and. the assessment of the X-factor are estimated to involve a total additional cost tothe Services of  75M, representing an increase of some 15% in the; total value of existing Service emoluments in cash or kind,     Improve-ments in allowances are estimated to cost a further  5 - 7M.     Thetotal money cost is estimated, to be of the or ier of  135 - 137M.(The bracket represents an area in which discussion is still continuingbetween the Civil Service Department and Ministry of Defence ofI certain improvements in allowances, and does not affect pay).     This: total necessarily follows from our acceptance a year ago of theI &quot;Military Salary&quot; concept and the elimination of the anomaly ofdifferential rates for single and married men for doing the same job.For the same reason, since much of this money cost is recovered bythe Government in new charges and taxes, the resource cost is only; about . 75M.12.   The coots are broken down in greater deta.1 in Annex C.      Annex D: sets out the associated pay scales.     For married officers in quarters: the net increases will be offset by the reduction of batman service inmarried quarters.     It would be more accurate to describe this aspart time domestic help (commonly be women cleaners) hithertoprovided as a service to certain officers in married quarters.     Forthese officers, who may set a cash value on this service it con be argued that the net percentage pay increases will not exceed 5.1^;while the junior officers aff selected will actually suffer net losses asshown in Annex D, page 1.      Agairust the benefit of the total package,; this can be accented.     However,  the point illustrates the impossibi-lity of reducing the proposed pay scales.Manpower: 13.   The costs have to be considered against the very serious manpoweri position of the Forces.     Even when the rundown of the Forces is complete we shall continue to need some u,0,000 recruits a year if weIare to maintain the Force levels required by our published defences policies.     This is rather higher than our earlier estimates,  theincrease reflecting an increased manpower turnover expectea to resulti from the necessity of offering shorter engagements in an attempt to; attract a wider field of recruits.     Allowing for recent recruitingshortfalls (in 1968/69 we recruited under 29,000) we shall still need,! on average, about us,000 recruits annually for the next few years, even allowing for the run-down of the Forces.     Recruiting in recent months] has shown some improvement but, even so, we expect to recruit no morethan about 3U,000 in 1969/70.! Income a policy 1lu   The following passage:; in cmnd. U237 bear directly on the question.j Although proposals for future wage restraint will turn on a band of; permitted rises between 2^fc and. h f    the White Paper explicitlyI recognised that a fundamental reorganisation of pay structure might wellI involve increases in pay which, on average, work out significantly above the normal range (paragraph 55).     The same paragraph of the WhiteI Paper referred in Jhia context to &quot;a more rational pay structure basedI on job evaluation&quot;&apos;.     Although the White Paper is discouraging in itsI attitude to pay increases purely on the grounds of labour supply      ,. vI difficulties it recognises that increases significantly above the normalI range may be justified where, detailed.Information is available aboutCOfciSLDENTIAL /comparative
-:::o;--i hdsntialcomparative pay and earnings for clearly similar jobs, and the discrepancy so substantial that even with an increase of i+ifr in pay,the employer is still likely to be left with serious labour difficulties (paragraph 89).15,   In the case of the Public Services the White Paper recognises that more reliance has to be placed in determining pay on the closestcomparisons possible with the pay of workers doing similar jobs in theprivate sector, subject to periodic reviews by the NBPI of precisely the kind which they have carried out in the case of the Armed Forces(paragraph 9h).     It should by now be widely accepted that to denyjustifiable increases to the Public Services carries the ri3k of creating manpower difficulties which only take effect over a periodof years and may take a correspondingly long time to eradicate.Moreover it may only be possible to eradicate them at the expense ofembarrassingly large increases at the end of the day.     The armed forces provide a case in point.160   The Board recognise the validity of our concern about the manpowerposition, and also say that in putting forward the proposed pay scalesthey have been guided, very largely by job evaluation, though it hasbeen necessary to eliminate from the pattern of Service pay inconsist-encies such as are found in the civil pay structure.17*   In discussing the outcome of jo!: evaluation the Board emphasise that Service trades for other ranks tend to be bigger than civilianjobs because of the greater breadth, versatility and supervisoryresponsibility required by the Services in their employees.     In thecase of officers the Board note that outstanding civilians, at all levels except the lowest, can expect faster promotion and that the ,careers of Service officers are relatively short.     They also say thatcomparisons with civilian pay need to take account of the greatdifferences that exist between Service and civil organisations,differences stemming from a basic difference of purpose.     They pointout that the Services&apos;  targets are set for them by the Government interms of numbers of men,     Tney must seek to deploy these numbers asefficiently as they can, but overall improvements in efficiency do notnecessarily lead to cost reductions of the kind that might be reflected in pay under an efficiency agreement.     However they believe that the structural changes they propose will help to make the Services more efficient because more highly skilled manpower will &quot;be better rewardedand more likely to remain in the Services, thereby bringing about agreater return for the cost of training and facilitating improvedeffectiveness in the deployment of manpower.18.   The Board emphasise that their recommendations involve somesubstantial changes in existing pay relativities, both within theServices and between the Services and outside employment.     they believe that the change:; within  the Services will be acceptable to .them.     The changes in external relativities result mainly fromapplying the new method which we accepted last year of comparingService pay with the current level of pay in civilian employment.     TheBoard are explicit that the new pyy scales should not be used by workers outside the Armed force.; (either in the public or the private sector) as a basis for pay claims desi Tied to restore the relativitieswith the Armed Forces that may have been traditional in the past.    Ifthis is accepted the recommendations cannot be fairly criticisedbecause of their possible repercussions on the remainder of the public services or on the private sector.
19,   Finally it is relevant to incomes policy considerations that theBoard describe their evaluation ox&apos; the &quot;X-factor&quot; as &quot;experimental&quot;.They intend to consider in the course of future reviews whether itneeds to be changed, taking into account the numbers of recruits thatcome forward and the proportion of men that is willing to re-engage.They suggest that the correct size of the &quot;X-factor&quot; element in paymight be the average Serviceman13 assessment of the nature of his jobcompared with that of an equivalent job in civilian life.     On this basis most Servicemen are likely to hold that the board have paidinsufficient regard to the elements in Service life which justify the&quot;X-factor&quot;.Defence Budget Implications20,   Of the total cost of  135-V37M referred to in paragraph 11 above, k!M has been agreed to be equivalent to a normal pay increase whichdoes not have to be met within the 1970/71 Defence Budget target;this leaves  90-92M to be found.      2fjM was set aside within the target for the additional cost of Forces&apos;  pay in 1970/71,  and theDefence Estimates are  I4.3M below the target.     On the assumption thatthe whole of this saving can be devoted to Forces&apos; pay, a total of 68M is available, leaving a gap in 1970/71 of  22-2UM.&apos;    For 1971/72the  90-9211 will be reduced by ;:30M, a notional allowance for a further year of normal pay increase:;, leaving  60-62M to be found.      25M hasalready been reserved within the target for this purpose so the netamount which has still to be found in 1971/72 is  35-37M.     It isproposed to find savings sufficient to offset this co3t by the time the1971/72 Estimates are finalised.     For 1972/73 a firm target will befixed following the 1970 Public Expenditure Review and the cost of forces&apos; pay will be included within this target.Staging.21,   In view of the sums involved in the ii,piementation of the wholeof the Board&apos;3 recommendations with effect from the 1st April and inthe light of incomes policy considerations the possibility of somestaging of the increar.es has been considered.     On the one hand theBoard have suggested that the Government may wish to consider stagingthe larger increases proposed, particularly those required to bringthe emoluments of single men up to married rates.     On the other hand,any form of staging gives rise, both in principle and practice, togreat difficulties:-a. The scope is limited.      .,e are publicly committed by anundertaking that there will be a very substantial increase for Servicemen next year, and that the Forces as a whole will be better off than they could have expected under grigg.Much of the cost of the Hoard&apos;s proposals must bo attributed to straight-forward restructuring,  i.e. introducing commonrates of pay for single and married men and turning allow-ances (grossed for tax) into pay, before any actual increase is paid,b. Servicemen leaving on pension during the period of.anystaging would suffer a permanent loss in their pension rates./c.-6-CONlFIDENTIAM,
VJHDSMT::. -.1.c.     Staging would in itselr be likely to rob the good effects which we expect from the new pay code of much of theirimpact.     Servicemen enjoyed their last pay increase underthe Grigg system in 19&amp;6,     They were entitled to a fullincrease under whatever substitute system the government might devise in 1968.     They received instead what were ineffect staged awards in 1968 and 1969 which, in the view ofthe Board, have still left them underpaid by currentcivilian standards.     Any further staging, i.e, until the1st April 1971, would mean that five full years had elapsedbetween the last full pay increase for the Services in 1966and their next one in 1971.     On the most rigorous inter-pretation of incomes policy it has never been suggested thatsuch prolonged staging should apply to any other occupationor profession, and to impose it would be regarded by Service-men as intolerable discrimination.22.   If, despite these objections,  it is felt necessary to meet theproblem of the excess of ih-S-: - 2UM on the Defence budget in 1970/71 bystaging, the form of staging which would be least difficult to defend,and which would accord best with the Board&apos;s own suggestion,  is togive single men a pay increase with effect from April this yearsufficient to offset the food and accommodation charges which will beintroduced for them at that date, and to give  them about one-half ofthe balance of the total increase recommended for them by the Board,the remaining half to be paid with effect from 1st April, 1971.(Staging can be only for one year since in two years&apos;   time we are committed to a further review of Forces&apos; pay by the Board under theStanding Reference).   The effects of this proposal are included in annex &apos;D*.-7-
ANNEX BHANSARD.  16TH JUNE.  1969 COLUMN U2For the long term,  the Government have accepted the recommendation that the forces should in future be paid a military salary which,while implying no reduction in the payment of married soldiers, will bring the payment of unmarried soldiers up to the level of marriedsoldiers and will also require the forces to pay charges for those services which are now provided free, such as rations and accommodation,guaranteeing that the forces will get increments of pay directlyparallel and equal to the charges which they are then expected to pay.The other two major long-term recommendations of the Boardrelate to the way in which pay rates for the individual ranks andtrades are determined.   The Government accept the Board&apos;s recommenda-tion that this should be decided by the most objective form of job evaluation which can be devised and that an addition should be madeto compensate Servicemen for the special disadvantages of Servicelife such as turbulence, danger and discomfort.The new proposals, which will be brought in next year, will represent a very substantial increase in pay for the Services above what they could have expected if the Grigg formula had been maintained.One of the most important aspects of the Board&apos;s report is that itdemonstrates that the base from which the Grigg formula started nolonger represents the relative skill and qualification of Servicemencompared with people in civil life, and that,  therefore,  the pay of servicemen relative to those in civil life should overall be substan-tially better than was envisaged under Grigg.

DRAFT GOVERNMENT statement the Government has received the National Board for Prices and incomes Third Report on Forces Pay and has accepted the board&apos;s -recommendations.2,    A year ago the Board recommended the creation of a comprehensivesalary structure which would provide the same rate of pay for single and married servicemen.   This &quot;military salary&quot; would include compensa-tion for the withdrawal of free services which had previously &quot;beenprovided in lieu of salary.   It was also proposed that the services should, &quot;because of the special conditions of their employment, receive an additional emolument.   This was to he known as the X factor.   Paymentof the military salary and the X factor -was deferred until new ratesof pay could be determined in the light of a job evaluation exercise.This has now been completed.3.    The cost of implementing job evaluation and the X factor proposals is  75m in a full year.   This represents an increase of 1 % over thepresent value of the Services total real emoluments.   The current prices and Incomes White Paper explicitly recognises that a fundamental re-organisation of pay may involve increases which on average work outappreciably above the normally acceptable rate.   It also anticipatesthat larger increases are justified when as a result of pay rates that have fallen seriously out of line with comparable employment a seriousmanpower shortage is the result.   Both these criteria apply to forces pay.   This increase will be paid in full with effect from 1st April,1970.U.    It is important to recognise - as does the Board - that thisrecommendation involves a substantial change in the relative positions of the forces and civilian pay.   By comparison with the civilian sector,the Armed Forces have been under paid.   To bring up forces&apos; pay tolevels comparable with civilian employment cannot, as the Board made plain, be a justification for pay increases elsewhere.   The Board make this very clear.5.    The cost of achieving parity between married and single men&apos;s pay is  52m in a full year.   It corrects an anomaly in the forces pay structure which has no parallel in other occupations.   Single pay willbe brought up to the married level in two roughly equal stages.,   fhmfirst will be paid on the 1st April, 1970, the second a year later./&quot;The NBPI recognise that part of the total pay bill might be staged.^In April of this year the increase in pay received by single servicemen. -as it includes both the job evaluation increases and the first stage of the military salary - inmost eases be. appreciably greater than thatreceived by their married counterparts.6*    The substitution of pay for benefits previously provided in kinddoes not, of course, make any addition to the salary bill.   A number of allowances have, however, been revised.   The increased cost of theseamounts to /* 7mJ7*in a full year./7. *. oI0TE;   *   Dependent on the resolution of the detailed issueoutstanding between the C8D and the Ministry ofDefence.
7.     The House will I am sure agree that the application of job evaluation and the radical revision of Service pay that the standingreference to the NBPI has made possible, provides the basis for amilitary salary which, both in terms of equity and efficiency, can be supported with confidence.
