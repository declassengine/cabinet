C(70) 38 COPY NO.    Oj2nd March. 1970CABINETCOMMISSION FOR INDUSTRY AND manpower memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Employment and ProductivityFollowing the Cabinet discussions in January, we published a consultative Document outlining our proposals for the Commission.Since then I have had discussions with the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI) and have received the reactions of the Trades UnionCongress (TUC),   A number of points have also been raised by other interests.    These are not of fundamental importance.Views of the CBI2.      The views of the CBI were put to us at a meeting and were verymuch as might have been expected.    They argued that there was no case for going beyond the examination of situations of monopoly or near -monopolythough they did not define the latter; but rather claimed that over thegreater part of the economy, competitive forces were actually increasingrather than diminishing.    They also argued that the legislation v/asfundamentally unbalanced because it did nothing to curb the unreasonableuse of power by trade unions and in particular contained no provisions forrestraint of inflationary pay settlements.3.      It became clear, both in this discussion and in subsequent oneswith officials, that the main fear of the C3I lay in the possibility that thepowers of price controls would be far more freely used than under the monopolies legislation.    Associated with this v/as a fear that the procedures adopted by the new Commission v/ould not give sufficientassurance to firms that they would be able to mount a proper defenceof their conduct.Views of the TUC4.      The TUC have told ire that they support the Governments general approach.    Their main reservation is over the reserve power to requirenotification of pay settlements before they are implemented.    They repeatthat, in their view, such notification should be a purely voluntaryarrangement and they reject the view that we cannot provide for priornotification of price increases without making similar provision for pay settlements,SECRET       -1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVEPv.N2.iENT)
The Form of the legislation.      Work on the drafting of legislation has been going forward and isnow at an advanced stage.6.      There is nothing in the reactions of the CBI and TUC which seemsto require any fundamental change in the proposals which we set out in the consultative Document,    I think, however, we should go some way to try and meet the quite real fears of industry that the procedures of theCommission will not give sufficient protection to those under examination and that the substantial powers included in the legislation will be toolightly used by Ministers.7,      Both the Monopolies Commission and the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI) have been left free to settle their ownprocedures with little limitation imposed by legislation,    I am advised that to include detailed provisions in the legislation would be extremelydangerous by leading to legal wrangles about whether the procedure hadbeen completely complied with.    But I think we ought to reach agreementwith whoever ia the Chairman of the new Commission on a number of matters concerning procedure which will go as far as possible to satisfy the CBI.    What I have in mind is that the Commission should be requiredto inform the firms concerned of the issues with which they intend to deal in their consideration of the reference.    This will give the firm anadequate opportunity to set out their case.    Further, I think that wherethe Commission comes to a conclusion that a firmls conduct has adverse effects on the public interest, they must so inform the firm and give thema final opportunity of rebutting the conclusion    In this way, it will be quite clear that no firm can be condemned by the Commission without an adequate opportunity of defending itself.8.      I have also reached the conclusion that we could go some wayto calm the fears of industry that the powers of price control will beused widely and unfairly.    We have already included in our proposals the safeguard that the price control power can be used only where theCommission finds that the firm is in effect abusing its market power.However, I think it would be helpful to draw some distinction in thelegislation between cases where firms&apos; behaviour in regard to prices has been found to be an abuse of market power over a substantial period,and cases where it is merely a specific price increase which has been examined and criticised.    Where we refer to the Commission the questionwhether a specific price increase is justified, and the reference is confined to that single matter, I intend to provide that the only power which can besubsequently employed by the Government is the power of price controland this power should be exercised only for a period of 18 months following the receipt of the report.    Without such a provision it would be technicallypossible to employ all the powers in the legislation - even theoreticallythe power of disvestment; and the power of price control could beexercised for an indefinite period.    I do not think this is in any wayappropriate to simple limited references on price increases which we want completed quickly.    The full powers would, of course, remainavailable in other types of reference,
Other Conditions  or the Use of Powers9.      When the Cabinet decided that members of the Commission shouldbe allowed to dissent from conclusions in reports, I pointed out that thiswould involve a risk that the CBI would demand that the powers should notbe exercised unless there was a two-thirds majority of the Commissionsubscribing to the findings.    They have not, in fact, yet raised this point(although they may do so at a later stage).    The Cabinet suggested that we ought to accept such a requirement, though possibly limited to reportsaffecting the structure of an industry.    The requirement for a two-thirds majority in the monopolies legislation relates only to cases where a panel of the Commission is dealing with a reference.    In such cases only a small number of people are concerned and a simple majority might consist of four people in favour and three against.    This would certainly be a ratherslender basis for the use of far-reaching powers.    But if the wholeMonopolies Commission consider a reference, the two-thirds majority would not be required.    It seems to me, therefore, unnecessary to include in the Bill on publication any requirement for a two-thirds majority since we are not providing for panels to report on references.    If we are pressed on this matter during the passage of the Bill, then we can reconsider it.Asa fall-back position we could provide that the powers which affect the structure of an industry - disvestment or prohibition of acquisitions - couldnot be exercised if a third of the Commission dissented from trie conclusionsof the report.Matters to which the Commission for Industry and Manpower (CII/l) shouldhave Regard10,       The Monopolies Commission is only required to have regard, tocertain matters which are comprised in the concept of &quot;public interest&quot;as set out in the 1948 Act.    The NBPI is required to have regard to a&quot;general considerations&quot; Order which has in the past embodied the currentWhite Paper on Productivity Prices and Incomes.    In our consultative document we said that the CIM would be given a definition of the &quot;publicinterest&quot; as in the 1948 Act; and in cases involving the prices and incomes policy &quot;would have regard&quot; to the prices and incomes policy of the time,11.       Neither the CBI nor the TUC like the idea of requiring the CIM tohave regard to the current White Paper.    The TUC say they are opposedto a provision &quot;if the guidelines set out in the White Paper remain&quot;.    the cbi object to the Government being able to vary from time to time theprinciples on which the Commission frames its recommendations;   they want it to be wholly independent of Government policy,12,      Yfe need to retain a definition of &quot;public interest&quot; in the legislation;but the 1948 Act wording could do with expansion.    It is worded in relationto the production of goods and needs elaboration to cover services.    At thesame time it would be possible to introduce references to the main objectives of any prices and incomes policy as set out in Section Cof the current White Paper,    A text revised on these lines and taking
account of other comments is attached as an Annex.    It is still subject todrafting.    The question is whether this would be sufficient guidance to theCommission or whether we should retain the power to make an Ordersetting out in more detail prices and incomes policy.13.      Against doing so we have to set the desirability of starting the workof the new Commission on a basis as far as possible acceptable to the C3Iand TUC; and the need to emphasise the independent status of theCommission.14.      The NBPI have, however, pressed me strongly to retain sucha provision, arguing that if the Government is operating an incomes policy the Commission must work within that framework, and cannot be left free to develop an alternative one of its own.    I see force in this argument.We also need to bear in mind the risk that dropping the provision may give the impression that we are finally abandoning the attempt to maintain a prices and incomes policy in the years ahead.15.      I should be grateful for my colleagues&apos; views on this.Notification of Pay Settlement16.      In spite of the TUC objection, I think we must stick to the reserveprovisions which would enable us to require prior notification of pay claims and settlements, price increases and dividends.    Although Ido not expect to have to use these powers, they form an essential background to any attempt to influence the course of pay negotiations and price increases,     I propose to place on employers the responsibilities for notifying us about pay claims received and settlements reached,so there will be no question here of penalties falling on trade unions.The only legal requirements falling on trade unions will, therefore,be to provide information if the Commission require it in connectionwith a reference.    It is clearly essential that the Commission shouldbe able to require information and we cannot distinguish here between all other firms and organisations and trade unions.Top Salaries Panel17,       Preliminary discussions with those concerned suggest that theproposal for the top salaries panel will prove generally acceptable.There will be some points of detail to be cleared up but they shouldnot affect the legislation itself,    I understand, however, from theLord Chancellor that his soundings with the Judiciary have not securedany acceptance of the idea that their remuneration should be consideredby the panel.    If, however, we decide not to include them in the groupsset out in the legislation as introduced, there will be power to add them at a later stage if the attitude of the Judiciary changes.
Conclusion18.      I propose, therefore, to put to Legislation Committee and introduceas soon as possible a Bill based on the proposals in the consultative document with the additional provision in relation to price referencesset out above.    I should be grateful for my colleagues views on the point raised in paragraphs 10-15.B.A.C.Department of Employment and Productivity, 3. Y/.1.2nd March, 1970
