SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVER.N1/IENT)QJJ&amp;lM,17th, February?^1^70CABINETfuture I^GISI-ATIONMemorandum by the. Lord President of the council I was asked at last week&apos;s Cabinet to circulate a. paper on theorganisation of the legislative programme for next Session and theinformation which Departments should be asked to supply at thisstage (CC(70) 7th Conclusions;, Minute 2),20      Forward planning of the legislative programme is of coursecomplicated at the present time by the fact that we do not know how long this Parliament is going to last,    We have to make, sure that weshall have enough Bills to keep it occupied throughout its life.    We alconeed to be ready with a programme of legislation for the first Sessionof the new Parliament whenever that may bec3,       We have already agreed a supplementary list of Bills to beprepared against the possibility that the current Session may be prolongedbeyond its normal course,    To the extent that this list is not disposed, ofin the present Parliament it will be there to draw on in the next; this willalso apply to the list of Second Reading Committee Bi.llse some of whichare unlikely to be enacted in the present Parliament unless it runs its fullcourse.,    Depending on the timing of the election there may also be someBills from the present main programme which, having failed to get through all their stages this Session, will be available for reintroductionat the beginning of the next Parliament,4.      In addition to these potential $aery-overs from the present Session,there are no doubt a number of possible new Bills which departmental ministers are already considering for introduction early in the nextParliaments    These ought to be identified as soon as possible so thatany policy issues needing collective consideration can be settled and authority given for drafting to begin as scon as resources become available.COPY NO,secret
50      It is impossible to tell at this stage whether all this will add up toa programme which could take us through the early stages of a new parliament while major Bills9 based on proposals in our manifesto,are being drafted^    We shall be able to judge this better when we know what new measures Departments have in mind and how advanced they arein the preparatory work06,      If my colleagues agree? X will now ask Departments to send in theusual returns of their proposals for  u&apos;&apos;5SS3 legislations, indicating in eachcase the present stage of preparation and when they would expect to be ableto give instructions to Parliamentary Counsel,,    Departments might alsobe asked to say whether any of the Bills included in tills Session5ssupplementary list are no longer required.    The Future -legislation committee could consider the returns towards the end oi&quot; March andI would report to Cabinet after Easter0fo 1? o PoPrivy Council Officed SaW:,l,17th February, 1970
