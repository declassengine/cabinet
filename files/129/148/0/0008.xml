HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PRQPER.TY OF HER. BRITANNIC MAJESTY SS GOVERNMENT)C(70) 28 COPY NO, ^      ^ * *CABINETUPPER CLYDE SHSFBUXI^ERS^3L31VIITEDMemorandum by1 th-3 Attorney; general at its meeting 023. 10th February? 1970 the Ministerial SteeringCommittees on Economic Policy invited the Law Officers to advise, in thelight of my Opinion oa Beagle Aircraft Limited (circulated under cover of C(70) 24), on the extent cf the Governments liabilities,, if any, to the creditors of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Ltd, (UCS)S2,      In that Opinion I expressed the view that a Government department would be party to fraudulent trading (within the meaning of s0 332 of theCompanies Act 1948) if the Department was knowingly a party to aninsolvent company continuing to carry on business, unless(a) there v;as a reasonable prospect that by doing sos or by someother means, it would become solvent againj or(b) the Department was satisfied that such  mads as might be needed to pay the creditors would be available from its own resources orotherwise,.It now appears that UCS are insolvent and have in effect been insolventsince, at army rateB August 1968,   The qtaesUoa arises whether theMinistry of Technology have knowingly been party to the Companycarrying on business while insolvent and without a reasonable prospect ofsolvency,   K they have so been, they can only avoid the inference that theyhave been party to fraudulent trading if  unds are made available to payexisting creditors,,30      There is no suggestion that there was a reasonable prospeet ofthe Company becoming solvent again without Government assistance..There are therefore two questions?-(1) were the Ministry party to the Company carrying on bustoessj(2) ii Yes5, was the Company8 at the tame when the Ministry were partyto the Company es carrying on business,, insolvent to the kao-^tedgecf the Ministry,,
4.      Both questions aa?e questions of fact,   ff the first question came to he decided by a Court there would be- room for a finding in the affirmative for the period 8 December on,   The case is, however c aborderline one and not really comparable to Beagle where the Ministryprovided the Company with cash  oar the express purpose of enabling itto continue trading without incurring a compulsory liquidation.Here no cash was provided and She Ministryss involvement in.themanagement o  the Company9 s business was limited to the exorcise ofa power of veto ovey such matters as the acceptance of new orders andentry into new commitmentss in anticipation of the provision dtGovernment finance,,5.      The second question is whether, during the time the Company wascarrying on business while insolvent^ the Ministry knew the Compaay wasinsolvent, Certainly it did when it received a latter from the FinancialDirector of the Company dated 31st Dscember, 1969 but doubts about itssolvency had been expressed to the Ministry on a number of occasionsbefore this date,6,      In the circumstances I think that if there were an immediatewinding up of the Company it would be prudent for the Crown to regarditself as liable for the debts of creditors whose debts were incurred after8th December, 1969 and for the debts of earlier creditors to the (sss&amp;entthat the assets of the Company were reduced by the trading of the Companysince that date.   In fact however that contingency will become hypotheticalif it is decided feat the Government should finance the continuance of  feeCompany!s business.   In those circumstances the Government would clearly have to ensure that its contribution to the resources of the company were sufficient to render it solvents which involvesB in effect, meeting all its existing debts.7o      The further question that arises is whethers if the Governmentmakes funds available to pay existing creditors s and to enable the company to continue tradings it will become responsible for future debts incurred by the Company.   I am instructed that in that event the degree cfinvolvement of the Ministry in the carrying on of the Company*s affairs inthe future will not diminish and will exceed mess protection of its rights as a creditor,,   It follows from the advice I gave in relation to BeagleAircraft Limited that the Ministry may thereby become liable to pay theCompany88 future debts, if and from such time as8 the Companya to theknowledge of the Ministry0 is trading while insolvent,Law Officers&apos; Department, W0 Co 2,nth February, 1970
