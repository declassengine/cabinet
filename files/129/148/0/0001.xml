S-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT&apos;;C(70) 219th February,, 1970COPY NO,CABINET0 the LONDON AUTHORITIES (TRANSFER OF HOUSINGESTATES,&quot;ETC&quot;) ORDER, 1970&quot;Memorandum by fchg Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentThe London Government Act, 1963 (Section  3) directs theGreater London Council to submit tc the Minister of Housing not later than April., 1970 a programme of transfers of Greater London Councilhousing to London boroughs,,    Where the Greater London Council and anyborough are in agreement in requesting an order for a transfer the minister has no option but to lay one.    The Greater London Council have now agreed with 25 of the 32 Load on boroughs for the transfer of certain e::- LondonCounty Council housing estates totalling 45s, 000 cut of the 2x0ff 000 greater london Council houses In Greater London? and I am laying the requisiteorder on 13th February as I am bound to do (as in the draft attached tothis paper)0    This is subject to negative resolution and the 40 days run outbefore 1st Aprils the date when it would come Into effecto20      The Party has always been opposed to these large-scale transfersin principle    There are two major objections to fchem&amp;-(a) The housing problems of London can never be properly attackedunless London acts as a whole$ with the less congested outerparts coming to the help of the more congested Inner parts to thegreatest possible extents    Any weakening 3,nd fragmenting of the strategic housing role and housing resources of the Greater london council, must be directly In conflict with this principle.,(b) Thirteen of the 25 boroughs taking part in the transfer proposals will be splitting single estates,,    One estate will be split threeways0    As regards these estatess different rent structureSj,tenancies and management practices will grow up In these singlegroups of houses and the anomalies will be starkc    This goes verymuch against good management principles,,
3.      Other points merit considerations-(a) The South-East Economic Planning Council in their Memorandumon the Greater London Development Plan has recommended thatall Londonfs housing problems should be handed over to one authority (the Greater London Council)? this Is a very significantstatement and whether or not it can be accepted In Its entirety it requires detailed considerations(b) The Labour Group on fee Greater London Council are strongly opposed to the proposed transfers.,(c) The tenants on one estate at least (Sta Heller) are deeply opposedto the transfero(d) Three of the four boroughs under Labour Control have refused totake any part in the transfer proposals (the fourth. Barkings, wishto take over the 8?300 ex-London County Council houses atBecontree),(e) The boroughs (especially the Inner borotighs) will have their handsvery full with other housing activities; we do not want to seetxnnecessary management burdens put on them,40      Nevertheless certain arguments may be advanced against the course now propose,,(a) It may be said that the ^&quot;strategic&quot; argument (paragraph 2(a)) Is nota good one because elaborate arrangements have been made tomaintain nomination rights for the Greater London Council in the transferred estates.(b) As regards the management argument against splitting estates(paragraph 2(b)), obviously this cannot apply to the twelve boroughsin which the transferred estates are not split,,     This cannot be denied - an order confined to those twelve boroughs would be adifferent things but it would of course still be open to the nstrategic&apos;&apos;argument,,(c) The boroughs who wanted the transfer might well say that they cancope wife the management problems without undue difficulty,,(d) It might be pointed out that the White Paper on Local GovernmentReform gives housing management In metropolitan areas to theseconds tier authorities,(e) It may be argued that where the two tiers are agreed on thetransfer this should not be rejected.
5C       On balance I propose, if my colleagues agree? to advise the house to reject this Order,    This should be done as soon as possible, not leastbecause the Greater London Council elections are on 9th April and it willbe desirable to have this matter settled well before thenc    It will not ofcourse be settled permanentlyl  the Greater London Council and anyboroughs in agreement with them could always apply again for an Order ata later date    But we must take that problem as it comes?  only legislation would be a permanent solution,,A 0 G &amp;Ministry of Housing and Local Government.-, S0W,1(6th February9 1970.3-
