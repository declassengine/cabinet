DOCUMENT IS THE property OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C(70) 25COPY NO.U &quot;SIttfh February,-, 2.970CABINETREPORT BY THE NATIONAL BOARD FOR PRICES AND INCOMES.&quot;ON SERVICE pay memorandum, by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 12th .Junes 1969f Cabinet approved (CC(69) 27th Conclusions,Minute 3). a recommendation from the National Board for Prices and incomes (N3PI) that the Armed Forces should in future be paid a&quot;military salary &quot;0 with the same rate of pay for single as for married men and charges for services (such as rations and accommodation) whichare at present provided free0    Cabinet at the same time agreed thefurther NBPI proposal that the level of the military salary should befixed by a form of job evaluation, with an addition, &quot;the SX! factor&quot;,to compensate for the special disadvantages of Service life.    TheSecretary of State for Defence announced these decisions in the Houseof Commonsf and in other public announcements made it clear that the effective date for the new system would be 1st April, 1970,20      The NBPI have now produced a further report, due to be published in the next week or two, on the outcome of their job evaluation studies,recommending the charges to be applied for hitherto free services andthe rates of military salary for each rank in the Armed Forces.    It Isestimated that to pay the Armed Forces at the rates proposed by the nbpi would add about  135 million to the present cost of Armed Forces&apos;pay and the cost of the existing free services.    Of this some  75 million would come from the general pay increase for all Serviceman arising fromjob evaluation and assessment of the &apos;X8 factor, as recommended by the nbpi in their reports about  5 million from improvements in allowances; 3 million from adjustments to pay and charges for married quarters; and 52 million from introducing the military salary.,    The general pay increase amounts to a 15 per cent addition to the cost of Armed Forces&apos;pay; the above increases all taken together amount to a 25 per cent addition,30       The Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes considered thismatter on 6th February.    The Secretary of State for Defence proposedthat the recommendations of the new NBPI Report should be accepted, in fulfilment of the Government9s public undertaking of last Juno and in theinterest of maintaining morale and Improving recruitment to the Armed
Forces.,    He accepted, however, thai to avoid creating serious difficulties for the defence budget, some of the total increase shouldbe postponed to 1st April,, 197X, and for this purpose he proposedthat part of the increase for single men should be staged,, with theresult that they would not reach pay parity with married men until april, 1971,    This would reduce the total increase in Armed Forces&apos;pay by about  23 million in 1970^710    It would be consistent with thesuggestion in the NBPI Report that the Government should considerstaging some of the larger of the increases proposed, particularly the once-for-all increases required to bring the emoluments of singlemen up to married rates,40       The Committee agreed that the N3PI&apos;s recommendations shouldbe accepted in principle,    I have also said that I am prepared to agreethat the  43 million by which the 1970-71 Defence Estimates fall short ofthe defence budget limit previously set for that year should be offsetagainst the Increase to be made in Armed forces pay for the year,on the understanding that the costs of the pay increases in the second year of their operation will be absorbed in the defence budget limitsfixed for that year, and that the same will apply to the third and fourthyears when defence budget limits for these are determined,5,      However, &quot;jSss CossamiS&apos;jae were wonceras5 abouta possible disparity between the Government1 s treatment of Servicemenand other groups, including nurses to whom wo are prepared to offer onlya 163 2 per cent pay increase this year, with a deferment to next^ear^of^^-the remaining 0, 3 per cent, of their total increase.    They cens4de adcts^uA C&amp;**: f^^*^*feat--feij Armed Forces11 pay increase should bo further staged, with for^LrvU-l d-o-o^v^i- t^ptarnple 16 per cent now and a further 9 per cent next year instead of^^vtwe^^v^     ^****jthe 20 per cent and 5 per cent staging proposed by the Defence Secretary,l^cl^t-k&apos; ^*      The Committee is to meet again this afternoon to consider two^ alternative s i(l) Staging p;n the basis of 20; per cent of the total increase inemoluments ,tbis year and 5 per, cent nextiyearThis would involve payment this year of the 15 per cent genes&quot;alpay increase and deferment for 12 months of about one half ofthe cost of introducing the military salary.    It would save about 23 million in 1970-71,(ii) Staging on the basis of 16 per cent fhj.s year and 9, per, cent nextyear.Under this alternative, the pay rates emerging from the formulaat (i) above would be further abated for the first year either:(a)     by one quarter for married and single men? or
CO .....(b)     by a larger amount for cingle men. osiy0This abatement would be made after allowing for the charges which the Armed Forces will have to pay in future for serviceshitherto provided i&apos;ree0    It would save a further  20 million,7D      I shall report, at Cabinet on Thursday the outcome of the Committeediscussion of these alternatives for staging part of the Services&apos; pay increase for 1970^71,Treasury Chamberss S0W01*nth Fefomsm?,
