C(70) 40 COPY NO.     ,  2 (&apos;j3rd March, 1970CABINETPAY OF THE HIGHER CIVIL service memorandum by the Lord Privy seal in C(70) 41, I make proposals for dealing with Stages 2 and 3 of the increases recommended for Chairmen and members of Boards of nationalised industries in Report No, 107 of the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI).    When we considered the pay of theHigher Civil Service last year in the Ministerial Committee on prices and Incomes following the report of the Plowden Committee I suggestedthat whatever pattern of staging might eventually be applied to nationalised industry Chairmen and Board members in respect of Stage 2 would also have to be applied to the Higher Civil Service.    Although no public announcement v/as made to this effect, the Government statement of11th July, 1969, on the Plowden Committee report was in similar terms to the earlier statement on NBPI Report No. 107 and there is a clearpresumption therefore that the two reports will be treated similarly.In particular, the statement of 11th July said that the Government accepted that the rates recommended were right in principle? that they should be implemented when the requirements of incomes policy allowed; that thefirst stage increases, being within the ceiling, would be implemented from 1st July, 1969, as recommended;   and that the rest of the increases recommended would have to be considered in the light of developments in incomes policy over the next two years.2.      In these circumstances it would be very difficult to justify differenttreatment so that if we decided to implement the Stage 2 increase for nationalised industry Board members on 1st April, 1970, we could hardlyavoid implementing in turn the Stage 2 increases recommended by the plowden Committee should in turn be implemented on 1st July, 1970.The increases recommended by the Committee are set out in the Annex.3.      The arguments for and against announcing the implementation of stage 3 of the nationalised industry increases which are set out inparagraphs 2-4 of C(70) 41 apply similarly to Stage 3 of the Plowdenincreases (except that this is due on 1st July, 1971, and will thereforebe three months nearer to the outcome of the Special Panel&apos;s firstreview).     In this area, however, we have to reckon with the attitudeof the National Staff Side whose interest will be to secure the earliest-1-]S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
possible implementation of both Stages 2 and 3; and they will be particularlywatchful in the transitional period between Plowden and the Special Panelfor any evidence that the interests of the Higher Civil Service are threatened.4.       The National Staff Side have just presented a claim urging the immediate payment of Stages 2 and 3,    Several staff associationshave a direct interest in what happens in the Plowden area; those who do not will oppose anything which looks to them like discrimination against the Civil Service even at this level, and the Staff Side have made clear on numerous occasions their strong opposition to the staging of increases which the Government has accepted as being due.    We shouldnot therefore underestimate the effect on the confidence of the Staff side in the Governments intentions if there appears to be unjustifiable delay in implementing the Plowden recommendations.5.      Apart from this aspect, the National Staff Side have already argued that it should be a condition of their acquiescence in the disappearance ofthe Plowden Committee and its replacement by the Special Panel that thereshould be &quot;a clean slate&quot;.    By this they mean that the Plowden rates shouldbe implemented in full in the near future and that the starting point of thefirst review of the Special Panel should be the assumption that the Stage 3rates were &quot;correct&quot; in relation to 1st July, 1969.    The plowden committee said that these rates did &quot;no more than achieve minimum standards of comparability&quot; in the circumstances of mid-1969 and made no allowance for subsequent pay developments outside the Service.6.      I do not however think that they would be likely to withhold their consent to the replacement of the Plowden Committee in the face of aGovernment undertaking to implement Stage 3 on 1st July, 1971.    Butif we said that we could not promise to do this because the Panel wouldbe conducting a fresh review ha 1971, there would be strong opposition which might decisively affect their attitude towards the Special Panelitself.    We have been successful so far in persuading the Staff Sidethat the Special Panel is intended to ensure that the remuneration ofthe groups affected is reviewed more effectively and consistently;  andto dispel their suspicion that it will be harmful to the interests of theHigher Civil Service,    I doubt very much whether we should still beable to reassure them if it appeared to them that the setting up of the panel is being made to justify the deferment of Stage 3 beyond 1st July,1971,    In that event we should be faced with the unpleasant task of abolishing the Plowden Committee in the face of Staff Side opposition and we should lose a most valuable opportunity of effecting a necessary reform in ourpay machinery in harmony with the interests of all concerned.7,      The implementation of the outstanding increases is also relevant to our progress towards the introduction of a unified structure at the top of the Service, which is of course a crucial first step in carrying out theFulton recommentations to which the Government is publicly committed.mo 2 *v
The Staff Side have also said that it is essential for the Plowden increases to be fully implemented &quot;before they can effectively enter into joint discussions on pay and grading at the top of the Civil Service&quot; in accordancewith the recommendations of the Fulton Report,8,      A further point stressed by the Staff Side is that staging bearsespecially badly upon those nearing retiring age because of the permanenteffect which it has on pensions, and this applies particularly in the higher civil Service,9.      While the wastage of senior civil servants to more highly paid jobsoutside the Service has not yet become a serious problem, it must be borne in mind that the Higher Civil Service includes senior professional staffwith highly marketable qualifications and experience.    If the salarieswhich can be offered to these staff continue to be substantially below the salaries they could command outside, the Service is in danger of losingsome of its most able staff.    Difficulties also arise at present where itis necessary to recruit staff at senior levels direct from outside.    Inthese cases it is often impossible to match the existing salaries of thestaff concerned without paying salaries which are seriously out of line with those paid to permanent civil servants at similar levels.10,      Delay in implementing the remaining stages of the Plowdenincreases would also lead to problems of vertical relativities withinthe Service.    Any 1970 central pay settlement for the lower gradesmust be reported to the Plowden Committee, who under current policycan be expected to recommend that it should be passed on to the assistant secretary and Under-Secretary grades.    The Assistant Secretary is alsodue for a pay research increase from 1st January, 1971.    This will lead toa compression of differentials between Assistant Secretary and Under-Secretary levels until the Under-Seer etary&apos;s present Plowden increase is fully implemented.    The problem of how to tie in the receipt by the under-Secretary of a central pay increase with the implementation ofStages 2 and 3 of the present Plowden increases will need furtherconsideration,11.       The presentational difficulties attaching to increases fornationalieed Board Chairmen and members apply equally to increases for higher civil servants and I recognise that they are considerable.Indeed the Stage 2 increases for Permanent Secretaries (21.4 per cent)are appreciably larger than the highest increases under Stage 2 for nationalised board salaries (16, 7 per cent for Group A classes).    ButI see no defensible basis for treating the two groups differently;  and considerable disadvantages for staff relations if we do,    I thereforeinvite my colleagues to agree, subject to the decision taken on C(70) 41that Stage 2 of the Plowden increases should be implemented on 1st July,1970, and, if Stage 3 of the nationalised board increases are to be implemented from 1st April, 1971, that Stage 3 of the Plowden increases
should be applied on 1st July, 1971;  and that an announcement should bemade to this effect at the same time as our decision about the nationalisboard increases is made public.S.Civil Service Department, S.W, 1,2nd March, 1970
