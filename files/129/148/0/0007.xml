The company have stated that(a) They need a  4 million loan from the Goverrument to enabie them tomeet outstanding bills from their trade creditors.   They expect to need a further  3 jzrallion for this purpose in April/May,(b) Given these loans, they expect to be able to get by with their normalbank overdraft and norsmal trade credits up to mid-January 1971,beyond which they have not estirosated their cash flow position,3.       The company are also concerned to ensure that they do not continuetrading while insolvent.   They estimate that there is at present a deficiency in their assets as against their liabilities of about  4 million andthey give this as a further reason for needing  4 million now.   They saythat if a lesser amount than  4 Hzrillion is lent to them now to pay bills,they could accept it only if assured that a total of  7 million will be forthcoming from the Government as required,4a      But this is not necessarily the whale bill.   The Attorney General isadvising on the extent of the Governments responsibility for meeting thecompany!s liabilities to trade creditors andasy contingent liabilities suchas to shipowner customers (C(70) 24).
