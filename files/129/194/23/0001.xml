Document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government cp(77) 2325 February 1977REVIEW OF NATIONALITY LAW:PROPOSED PUBLICATION OF A DISCUSSION DOCUMENTNote by the Secretary of State for the Home department. I attach the draft of a document designed to promote discussion on what changes are needed in our nationality law.2. The law on nationality is outdated in many ways and we undertook inour Election Manifesto to examine it.    A working party of Ministers and officials under the chairmanship of the former Minister of State, HomeOffice (Mr Lyon) reported last year.    Recommendations made in the lightof this report have been considered by Ministers.3. That Group has approved the substance of the document as a basis for public discussion, and agreed, subject to its consideration by Cabinet,that it should be published at an early date.4. The main points in the document are summarised in its preface.    Themost important is the suggestion that the present citizenship of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies should be divided into two, a British citizenship for people connected with the United Kingdom, and a British Overseas Citizen-ship for the remainder.    Changes of this nature in the nationality law would affect numerous people overseas and would be of concern to overseas governments.    It will be desirable confidentially to inform commonwealth and Colonial and a small number of foreign Governments of the contents of thepaper before it is published.    The preface makes clear that the Governmenthas no immediate plans for bringing forward legislation and wishes to take account of views which representative bodies and individuals may express.5. My predecessor and I have promised at various times to make knownthe outcome of the review of nationality law, and I repeated this promise inthe House following the publication of the Franks Report on 9 February.    I ask my colleagues to agree that (subject to any minor revisions that may benecessary) a document as in the attached draft should be published.    Thenecessary consultation with Commonwealth etc. Governments will take atleast four weeks, and publication is therefore unlikely to be possible muchbefore the Easter recess.M RHome Office25 February 1977COPY NOCABINET

. \t      ... -:. .:  PREFACE .-y;&apos;v; ; -. -    - THE CASE FOR CHANGEThere have been many changes in British Gociety and in thiscountry1 s role in the world since the British Nationality Act which provides the basis of our citizenship was passed in 1948*   The law,which has been amended from time to time, is complicated and obscure,and because Britain is no longer an Imperial power the all-embracingconcept of nationality associated with that role, -in pa^-tiou-lar thecitizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies, is no longer appropria&apos;   &apos;   The main defect in our present law is that our citizenship, as\n*plCcsindeed its name ap ii*js, relates both to the United Kingdom and overseterritories, and so does not provide the ready means v/hich is availablto other countries, including our e.c. partners, of identifying thosewho ,belong* to the country and have the right to enter and live in it-freely. In contrast, many countries, both Commonwealth and foreign,have defined their citizenship so that it corresponds either completelor- closely with the right of entry, &apos; &quot;&apos;vThe Labour.Party Manifesto of February 1974 maintained that thelaw of nationality should be revised so that immigration policies coul-be based on citizenship; and soon after taking office- the Goas a first step, set up a group to examine the present law and suggestalterations. &apos;-This document is based on their work ,   It is published as a discussion document because alterations in the law of citizenshipwould affect everyonejn this country and many people overseas.   Thereis room for widely differing views as to what should be done; it is right that there should be opportunity for interested persons, andOHI\feO 5\!7!A! &quot; -----

The main idea3 canvassed in the document are summarised below..     THE POSSIBLE CHANGESTwo new Citizenships -. .&apos;. .:... / In p paragraph s 12-14A it is suggested that the present citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies might be replaced by two citizenshi-.British Citizenshin for those who have close ties with this country,and a British Overseas Citizenship which would be held by the remaindeof those persons who are now citizens of the United Kingdom and Colon!People who would become British Citizens.-       It is suggested that British Citizenship should be conferred, fngeneral, on those citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies whe werebom, naturalised or registered here; on those who hold that citizenshiby descent and -have the right of entry; and on those citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies and British Protected Persons fromdependencies or former dependencies (including those form East Africa)and British subjects without citizenship, who have settled in thiscountry for a specified period (paragraphs 16-23).It would be the intention that British Citizens - and onlyBritish Citizens - should have an unqualified right of free entry tothe United Kingdom; but there are some people who now have such aright who would not become British Citizens under these proposals,and there are arguments for allowing them to retain this right fortheir lifetimes (paragraphs 2/]-?7).&quot;:; onnsrrv?.win a
Movement within the EECThe present definition of * United Kingdom national for e.c. purposeswould need to bo redrawn, in negotiation with our partners in theCoromunity, so that all British Citizens would have the same freedom of movement within the e.c. (paragraph 28).Transmission to Children Born AbroadIt is suggested that, in general, tho transmission of BritishCitizenship to those born abroad might be confined to the firstgeneration (paragraphs *iO&quot;Vf), and that women should be able to transsiit to their illegitimate, as well as to their legitimate, children bornabroad (paragraphs ^6-39)*Acquisition by Virtue of Marriage*Under the present nationality law of the United Kingdom , a woman whomarries a man from this country has the right to acquire her husband1scitizenship.     But a man from overseas who marries a woman from thiscountry has no such right.    The document discusses whether the law foracquiring citizenship by virtue of marriage should be altered to treatboth sexes equally.     It makes some reference to the laws of othercountries in this field (paragraphs k6^hS).^&apos;NaturalisationTho question whether there should be any change in the requirements forthe grant of naturalisation, for example as to the standards ofcharacter and knowledge of the language, is discussed in paragraphsDual NationalityOur present law imposes no restriction on the holding of dualnationality.     Paragraphs 59-6.?. mention some of the complexitiesarising from dual nationality and discuss what changes might be made.
CONFIDENTIALBritish Overseas CitizenshipIt is suggested that British Overseas Citizenship might be conferred or.those citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who were born,naturalised or registered in an existing dependency, or whose fatherswere so born, naturalised or registered.     This status would also be conferred on those people who are now citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies and British Protected Persons but who would not becomeBritish Citizens.    As a general rulo entry to a dependency would belimited to those who are British Overseas Citizens by virtue of aconnection with it.     And British Overseas Citizenship would not carry with it the right of entry to the United Kingdom (paragraphs 65&quot;*67).It would be necessary, so that British Overseas Citizenship should inthe longer terra be related to dependencies only, to make the rules foracquisition and transmission more restrictive than those for BritishCitizenship (paragraphs 68-71).The Special Question of UK P?^sport Holders from East AfricaThese arrangements would not affect the obligation which the Governmenthas assumed towards holders of United Kingdom passports from East africa and the special voucher system would continue (paragraph 67A)./The Government has no present intention of bringing forward early legislation on nationality.     Therefore there will be ample time for
this document to be studied and discussed.     The Government have not reached any conclusions on a future scheme of citizenship and on all matters it will find comment helpful.     The document, howevor, statesclearly at various points where the Government are inclined towards aparticular course.    The Government are publishing this document aspart of the process of open government and it is intended to prepare the way for a new nationality law which is clear and fair and whichwill give a fresh meaning to the concept of citizenship .*
THE NATIONALITY LAW;   DISCUSSIONOF POSSIBLE CHANGES%RPDUCTION*    The Government have been reviewing the working of the British Nationality Acts,chief of these was passed as long ago as 1948, and much has happened since thentosuggest that a new nationality lav; is needed.   A discussion paper cannot covereVery problem which arises on this complicated subject;   but the Government hope that^e paper will serve to indicate the major issues for discussion and eventualVision.&apos;    The paper does not seek to discuss such matters as the subtle differences betweentonality and citizenship but concentrates on practical issues.   At present what weis a citizenship which does not define those who have a close connection withe united Kingdom;   in this respect we are at a disadvantage compared with most0tW countries.%^JRRE1IT NATIONALITY LAW-*^S itish Nationality Act 19483t       ---Our present system of citizenship is unsatisfactory in several ways.   To under-s^Ud i-t fuiiy9 it is necessary to describe how the 1948 Act came to be.   BeforeJanuary 1949 when the 1948 Act came into force, everyone vho owed allegiance to British Monarch (for example, by birth in, or connection with, the United Kingdom,Pinion or a Colony) was a British subject.   There were al30 large numbers of^6oPle to whom British protection had been granted? (British Protected Persons).   Bute need to identify the people of each self-governing Dominion by means of a distinct*-Onal status more narrowly defined than British nationality was increasingly feltthose countries.   Eventually, in 1946, Canada created its own citizenship, although- ^1 within the framework of British subject status.   After a conference held in^ n$cn in 10,47f the other independent countries of the Commonwealth followed suit, as^0 other countries on achieving their independence within the Commonwealth.   Underth6 y,Qev? arrangements, each country wa3 to determine who were its citizens, to declaretheSe citizens to be British subjects, and to recognise as British subjects theiaens of other Commonwealth countries.   However, each country was.left free toi(^3 what this recognition should entail, so that the content of British subjectcu3 has come to vary widely within the Commonwealth.The Act of 1948 introduced these principles into United Kingdom law.   It createdC12enship of the United Kingdom and Colonies, with the continuing status of. ASh subject, and laid down rules for its acquisition.   It was relatively simple^provide how this status should be acquired in future, but it wa3 more difficult
&apos;0 decide which of the British subjects then alive should become citizens of thett&amp;ited Kingdom and Colonies.   The Act gave that citizenship not only to BritishEjects then alive who had ties with the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and^6 Isle of Han, or with a Colony, but also gave it to some Eritish subjects who^fl Rot, for one reason or another, acquire the citizenship of another Commonwealth0oUntry.   But most of the Commmonwealth countries vrhich were then independent had yet to pass their citizenship law3, and the 1948 Act therefore provided that BritishEjects who had ties with those countries should be regarded as potential citizens0 them.   These people remained British subjects but had to wait for a final^termination of their status until the countries with which they were associatedVfi*e deemed to have passed citizenship laws (or until they acquired citizenship of^ther Commonwealth country or of the Republic of Ireland in some other way, or^6canie aliens).   Only if they then failed to obtain a citizenship would they becomeciti.?,ens of the United Kingdom and Colonies.   In the meantime they were to hold the&quot;horary nontransmissible, status of British subject without citizenship.5tThe Act also provided that all those holding citizenship of the United Kingdom^ Colonies or of a Commonwealth country should be regarded in United Kingdom lawBlitish subjects (or Commonwealth citizens - the terms were to be synonymous),tempted them from the disabilities of aliens.   Citizens of Eire were similarly6*6l&amp;ptea, &amp;nd those who were alive when the Act came into force and had been BritishEjects with ties with the United Kingdom were enabled to give notice to remain so.Act made it easy for a citizen of a Commonwealth country who had come to live ine United Kingdom to acquire citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies; he hadeJ-y to show that he had been ordinarily resident here for 12 months.   OtherVlsions of the Act enabled British women who married foreigners to keep theirlzenship on marriage (before the Act they had ceased to be British subjects..optically), and gave women from other countries who married citizens of the United^do a and Colonies the rip-ht to acquire their husband&apos;s citizenship, on application^But 1j .&quot;^itish women could not in any circumstances transmit their citizenship to their^tiren born overseas, and the husbands of British women had no right to acquirevrives1 citizenship.   The Act was followed by an Order which made new arrange-s for the status of British Protected Persons..     At is v/orth emphasising at this point that the 1948 Act had no effect on ration to the United Kingdom.   At that time British subjects/CommonwealthASens were entitled to enter and leave the United Kingdom freely; it was not untilxnat any of them became subject to immigration control.
SigBgea since the 1948 Act6*   The scheme set up under the Act has met with various difficulties.   First, the8t*tus of British subject without citizenship, which was intended to be transitional,has Persisted.   This is because India and Pakistan enacted citizenship laws in 19501951 which withheld citizenship from many people who had derived their status of*tish suhject from their connection with those territories and who were regarded byBritish Government at the time of the passing of the 1948 Act as potentialWizens of those countries.   The United Kingdom did not feel able to grant citizenship0f the United Kingdom and Colonies to all these people from India and PaVistan whoha* failed to acquire such citizenships.   They often had no connection with the United***edom or a Colony.   The status of British subject without citizenship has therefore^ined in existence longer than originally expected, but as people have obtained^ citizenships they have ceased to hold it, and since it relates to people bornWore I949, the numbers are diminishing.7.Other problems developed as more countries of the Commonwealth became independent,these countries did not confer their citizenship on all the citizens of the kingdom- and Colonies who had ties with them.   Kenya, for instance, did not give0Ble of these countries did not confer their citizenship on all the citizens of theitscitizenship to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies born in Kenya beforePsndence, unless one parent had been born there.   There were similar problems with*itj iisn Protected Persons linked with some territories.   So significant numbers of^0Ple, for instance in East Africa and Malaysia, did not acquire local citizenship^dependence and remained citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies or British&apos;0l-&amp;selected Persons even though they had no close connections either -with the United^dom or witj1 one of the remaining Colonies.   Often they hold no other citizenship.wer the years thel948 Act has been amended about 40 times.   There have been^ --cus reasons for this.   A large number of Colonies have become independent and itkeen necessary to withdraw citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies from^e who acquired citizenship of the newly independent country but had not at the^     time a close connection with the United Kingdom or a continuing Colony.   Other^(teents have been needed when countries, for example South Africa and Pakistan,j-ert the Commonwealth, to provide that although their nationals were henceforwardAgners in United Kingdom law they were to continue for a limited time to retaineligibility to acquire our citizenship by registration as if they had continued*6 hoCommonwealth citizens, rather than by naturalisation.   Further important^ento in the qualifications for acquiring citizenship of the United Kingdom and^0n tles vere made in the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 and the Immigration Act9?1     A^  *   Apart from these amendments there have been others, for example to meet thee^ Kingdom&apos;s obligations under international agreements.   As a result of these
Serous amendments British nationality law has become difficult to follow.The most serious drawback to the status of citizen of the United Kingdom andMonies is that it does not provide a ready definition Of who has the right of entry*0 the United Kingdom.   In m03t other western countries, citizens - and citizens only -automatically have the right of entry.   Under our system, a citizen of the United^ttgdoitt and Colonies may not have any close ties with the United Kingdom, or even&quot;th a remaining Colony.   So, v/hen successive Governments have found it necessary toCoHtrol immigration from the Commonwealth, they have felt obliged to distinguish^between the citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies whose close ties w?&quot;th the^ited Kingdom gave them a claim to be freely admitted here, and the remainder.nose distinctions within a common citizenship have been hard to follow.   They have caused confusion and have encouraged the belief that our immigration laws containe^aents of racial prejudice.   The Immigration Act 1971 increased the confusion, eisce^ only did distinctions within the citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies0l*tinue, but the right of entry was also conferred, to a limited degree, on certainWizens of other Commonwealth countries.   As a result, for example, certain^stralian and Indian citizens may have a right of entry to the United Kingdom whichS0Ble citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies do not possess.*  Details of the numbers and whereabouts of British subjects, citizens of the^ited Kingdom and Colonies, British Protected Persons and British Subjects withoutC^2enship, are given at Annex A.   The overwhelming majority of citizens of thexted Kingdom and Colonies have close associations with the United Kingdom or anbating dependency, and have the right of entry to one or the other.   A substantial^ber (j0 noi have 3ucn a right or entry;   but many of them are well established inBi* country of residence and many have dual citizenship^   The numbers of citizens of f,wie United Kingdom and Colonies in East Africa are declining since those who wishcome here are being admitted gradually to the United Kingdom under the specialr scheme;   and the Government have every intention of continuing that scheme.StSSENT situation the Act of 1948 reflected the situation of the United Kingdom at that time.   The^try vas still an Imperial power;   it had direct responsibility for very largeRations in Colonial territories.   The status of British subject, held by all who4 links with the Commonwealth, still seemed meaningful and relevant.   The speed atn colonial territories were to become independent was not then generally apparent.t   a 8 status lagged considerably behind that of men.   All these things have changed,the cumulative effect of the changes has been that the citizenship laws of the
CONFIDENTIAL^ited Kingdom no longer accurately define those who have the normal attributes* citizenship.   This in turn leads to considerable uncertainty and misunderstanding,*oth at home and overseas, about the United Kingdom^ obligations to its citizens.%NgXT STEP - A NEW SCHEME OF CITIZENSHIP12-   A new scheme of citizenship should reflect the strength of the connection which**ious groups of people have with the United Kingdom in the world today.   Firsttttore must be a more meaningful citizenship for those who have close links with the**ted Kingdom and who can be expected to identify themselves with Brlt** society,^se holding this new citizenship might be known as British Citizens.Such a citizenship would avoid the present difficulties described in paragraph 90f ^fining which people are to have the unqualified right of entry to this country.Bu* it might then be necessary to provide protection for the rights of entry now6*Joyed by people who did not qualify for the new citizenship, and this is discussed^ toore detail in paragraphs 26-27.U-   Second, arrangements must be made for those people who are now citizens of the**ted Kingdom and   Colonies (or British Protected Persons), but who do not have suchClo*e ties with the United Kingdom as to become British Citizens.   These people tooVo*la have to be given a new status.   To leave those of them who are citizens of the**** Kingdom and Colonies with that status when many of them have little or no action by birth, ancestry or residence with the United Kingdom or any Colony^ prolong a misleading and unsatisfactory feature of the present situation.^ad, both they and the British Protected Persons might be known as British^oas Citizens, thus bringing their status more closely into accord with prcsent-circumstances.   The aim might be to limit this citizenship eventually te thoseVho*aVe the right of entry to.a dependency.   British Overseas Citizenship would then**** With it the right of entry to a dependency just as British Citizenship wouldwith it the right of entry to the United Kingdom.   But this, it must be stressed,&apos;0ul&amp; be a long-term aim.^  With the conferment of British Citizenship on some citizens of the United**Mom m&amp; Colonies, and British Overseas Citizenship on the remainder, citizenshipOf1thq United Kingdom and Colonies would disappear.
UB&apos;.   There would be separate passports for British Citizens and British OverseasCitizens, and the British Government would be entitled to afford consular protection to holders of both citizenships in the same way as it does at present to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies.J&apos;   Some possible arrangements for a British Citizenship and a British Overseas^tizenship are discussed in details below.   For both citizenships, these would falllato two parts:(a)   arrangements for deciding which citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies (and other persons eligible to hold British passports)alive when a new scheme came into force were to become either BritishCitizens or British Overseas Citizens - that is, the transitional arrangements;andthe arrangements for acquiring the citizenship by birth, naturalisationetc. after the scheme was introduced - that is, the   permanentarrangedents.\
A BRITISH CITIZENSHIPTRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.^m^-CltlZenS Qf        Unit0d KJL-nsd0m and Colon1^ who might become British16.      As indicated above, British Citizenship would be for those citizens ofthe United Kingdom and Colonies with close ties with the United Kingdom (for thisPurpose the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man would be treated as if they formed part of the United Kingdom).     Clearly, therefore, the citizenship would be con- erred at the outset on those who are now citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies because they were born here, adopted here, or acquired citizenship hereby some voluntary act such as applying for naturalisation or registration.&apos;&apos;7*      Then there are those citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who, though not born, naturalised etc. here themselves, hold their citizenship because of theDirth or naturalisation of a parent or grandparent here, or v/ho for somewhat similaiReasons have the right of entry.     Where family ties are as close as this these people too might become British Citizens.18o      Third, there are those who acquired citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies overseas, (for example, because they were born in a dependency or aformor dependency) have remained citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, andhave made their homes here.     The largest element in this group is probably from east Africa.     Many of these people have been admitted to this country specificallyfor settlement under the special voucher scheme because they were under pressure*n their country of residence, had not acquired local citizenship and could not,for instance, work there. -In most cases they could not have gone elsewhere.Their future lies here.   They have established a tie with this country through their residence here on a permanent basis and this should be recognised by confer-ring British Citizenship on them.19.      Mere presence alone on a specified day, however, would probably not be enough to qualify for citizenship.     The length and nature of residence wouldhave to be laid down, establishing that the link was a real one.   BritishCitizenship might, for instance, be conferred only on those citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies from overseas who had been resident in the United* excluding those who, though they are registered in the United Kingdom, arenot, under our present law, exempted from immlgratxon control.
OJJMiEMTJAL^-%dom for a specified time and were free of any conditions on their stay at theend of that time.   Any qualification of this kind would, however, have to be simple^ easily proved, since otherwise the person concerned might find it difficult, or^3 descendants might, to prove that he had become a British Citizen under theWsitional arrangements.   For those citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies*foo could not fully meet the requirements on the specified day it might be right tosome special arrangement by which they could later acquire British Citizenship.&quot;lake5l\* A&apos; further group might also be made Citizens.   These are women citizens of the^ited Kingdom and Colonies who would not qualify for British Citizenship in their0lftt right, but whose husbands would become British Citizens.   This would cover, forStance, a woman, who is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies by virtue of birth in Hong Kong, who is married to a man who is a citizen of the United Kingdom^ Colonies by virtue of his birth in the United K5.ngdom.   The numbers concernedVf0uld not be large.^^IJLffswos of persons eligible to hold British Passports* Two other groups of British passport holders might also qualify for BritishCiUzenship if they have ties with the United Kingdom through their residence here.tip-se are British Protected Persons and British Subjects without Citizenship.   The^sidential ties would be defined for them in the same way as for the citizens ofthe2?* The British Protected Persons who would qualify for citizenship in this wayVo^ld for the most part have come to this country from East Africa for permanent!3ei;tlemerat, entering under the special voucher scheme.   They were admitted in this^ because they faced the same problems as citizens of the United Kingdom andMonies there and for the purposes of the new citizenship there would seem to be110 Reason to treat them differently when they are settled in the United Kingdom.ft&apos;   The origins of the status of British Subjects without Citizenship are described* ove in paragraphs 4 and 6.   The numbers who would be eligible for citizenship^0Ugh their residence in the United Kingdom must be very small since British Subjects^chout Citizenship who have made their home in the United Kingdom have been eligibleRegistration as citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies since 1949 (for most0f the time as cf right).the United Kingdom and Colonies from overseas (see paragraph 19 above).
gffg IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES ON THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM&apos;i)      Those who would acqiiire the right of entry for the first time2**      British Citizenship would carry with it the right of entry to this country.So everyone who becomes a British Citizen under the transitional arrangements woulchave such a right of entry.     But most of these people are already exempt from inrrieration control, and conferring British Citizenship on them would not affect irami-B^atlon to this country.25.      There are, however, three groups who are not free from immigration control ePresent;   they would therefore acquire the right of entry for the first time.First, there are those citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies from overseas*ho have been resident here for less than 5 years, and their wives.     But they havemost cases already been accepted for permanent residence.   To grant them citizen-fcwiship would not commit the United Kingdom to accepting any new group of permanentResidents.     They there are the British Protected Persons and the British SubjectsWithout Citizenship who have made their homes here;   a few of the British SubjectsWithout Citizenship are exempt from immigration control but for the most part they^d the British Protected Persons are not exempt.     But they, like the citizens oftho United Kingdom and Colonies mentioned above, have for the most part alreadyW accepted for permanent residence.     They are here to stay,   and to grant themBritish Citizenship with the right of entry to the United Kingdom would not involve any new immigration commitment.(ii) ^n^te for those who have the right of entry but would not become&quot; British Citizens*.        Some people who now, as patrials, have the right of entry to this country^der the Immigration Act 1971 would not become British Citizens if the law were amended as suggested above.   These ares-(i)     citizens of a Commonwealth country with a parent (in practicealmost invariably the mother) who was a citizen of tho UnitedKingdom and Colonies by birth in the United Kingdom;(ii)     women Commonwealth citizens who have the right of entry at presentbecause, and only because, their husbands have the right of entry;(iii)     citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies from overseas who were at one time settled in the United Kingdom and resident here for 5 years, but who cannot meet the residence qualifications for BritishCitizenship.
Although it is intended that only British Citizens chould have tho right of entry tofte United Kingdom, there fire arguments for nuking some exceptions for the people inthese groups and allowing them to retain their present right of entry for theirlifetimes.(iii) British Citizenship and the right of free movement within the EEC28. It would be necessary to re-examine, in negotiation with our partners, tho presentkfinition of United Kingdom national for e.c. purposes.     The Government would wish allch Citizens to have the right of free movement within the e.c..     But if the^ansitional arrangements suggested above were to be enacted, there would be someIfcople who would become British Citizens but who have not the right of free movement&quot;fider tho definition now in force.     These would include those citizens of tho United^gdom and Colonies frop overseas who have been settled and resident in tho United^gdom for less than five years, the British Protected Persons, and (for the most part)^ British Subjects without Citizenehip resident in the United Kingdom.british CITIZENSHIPS&amp;tNEOT AKBANGEMENTS^&apos; These would be the arrangements for acquiring British Citizenship by birth, descent0r 0 voluntary act, such as applying for naturalisation, once a new scheme of^tigeaship had come into force.    Unlike the transitional arrangements, these would^ affect people then alive who held our citizenship, and there is therefore a wider^ge of possible courses to be considered.     Some ideas are set out below.^&apos; Citizenship by birth^&apos; The United Kingdom, in common with the USA, Latin American and many commonwealth countries, at present confers citizenship on everyone who is born in the United Kingdom^ indeed in the Colonies), irrespective of their parents&apos; citizenship.     In contrast,^Itinental countries confer their citizenship on those born in their territories only*f the child&apos;s parent ie himself (or herself) a citizen of the country.     These two^hods of conferring citizenship are known respectively as the ius soli and the^iS^nguinis.10 ,:&apos;-HiL ri2li. method - traditionally used in the United Kingdom - is simple andElusive.     Anyone who is born here is a citizen unless his father is a diplomat of
Mother country.    This encourages the integration of people from abroad.    The childW here to, say, Polish or Indian parents is a citizen of the United Kingdom and^lonieo from birth;   he is encouraged in this way to identify himself with thiscountry.     Under the iuscanguinis method by contrast he would have to take hie parent&apos;tonality, and would only acquire our citizenship by some voluntary act, such as&quot;&quot;totalisation.     It is possible, under such a system, for successive Generations to*ive in a country and never become citizens.3J- On the other hand, some people might think that the iua soli method is tooSerous.     It confers citizenship indiscriminately on all who happen to be born here,ev*ft if for instance the mother is en route elsewhere.     The problems caueed by transieliters can, however, be exaggerated;   a child born here by accident is not likely by&amp; large to exercise his claim to our citizenship.     But it is true that we conferWizensftb*oadship on children who, though born here, may be brought up and live their livee, and on children whose parents, though entirely unconnected with the UnitedHsdom, have arranged for the child to be born here to acquire citizenship for its&amp;0GBible usefulness later.     On the whole the Government consider that the rimplicity^ inclusiveness of the ius soli method outweighs its drawbacks.Citizenship by adoptionUnder the Adoption Acts 1958 and 196^ a child who is adopted in the United KingdomEluding, as elsewhere in this report, the Channel Islands and tho Isle of Man)*UWcically becomes a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies if the person&quot;Ving the child is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, or in the case of afcl*t adoption, the man is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies.*&apos; This principle might well be carried over into a new British Citizenship.     But incase of a joint adoption, it should suffice if either parent was a British Citizen,M* would bo in line with the Government*b general policy of working towards equal^tment between the sexes.Citizenship by descent&apos; Wer the United Kingdom law, as mentioned above, everyone who is born here is^SticeOly a citizen.     So the only people who are citizens by descent in our law areborn abroad who have some link with this country through their fathers, whichthem a claim to our citizenship.     In looking to the future, there are two main
lBsue8 to be considered.     First, whether the present inability of a woman to transmither citizenship to her children born abroad can be justified.     Second, how far^Zenehip by descent should be allowed to go - that is, how many successiveOrations born abroad should be allowed to have our citizenship.^SSgn^throurh the female line^* *n the past, nearly all countries allowed only men citizens to transmit theirl2enship to their children born abroad.     This was based on two arguments.     First,Coiintries were reluctant to see dual nationality proliferate - as would happen whentiohale of two countries married and both were able to transmit their citizenship toeir children.     Second, in such &apos;ffiixed&apos; marriages it was thought that the man&apos;sCcuPation was crucial in deciding v/here the family would live.     The mail would tend to1 J-n his ovn country rather than his wife&apos;s;   the family home would therefore bethere;   the children of the marriage would grow up there and would inovitabl;^ 0ciate themselves more strongly with their fathers country than with their mother&apos;s.&apos; ^ to the first of these arguments, the United Kingdom has adopted a very tolerant^itude to dual nationality.     The second argument is certainly no longer so powerful60 generally accepted.     Family patterns are altering;   the woman&apos;s interests can be^   -portant as the man&apos;s in deciding where the family home should be;   in any case,^Ues are more mobile.     These changes have led a number of countries, including VestCanada and the USA, to pex-mit their women citizens to transmit their citizenship0tlta^   roadly the same terms as men.     In the United Kingdom much has been done to end^imination on grounds of sex, and the opportunity should be taken to do so in *iality law.     The Government considers that these factors would justify changingruIos for citisenship by descent iii a new scheme of citizenship.A*ier0        however, some practical problems.    It would not be difficult to legislate^t, from a certain dato, women could transmit their citizenship on the sa^e termsftn to children bora after that date.    But what about the children born before that should they bo granted citizenship and if co, how?^ Ta ,^   AO designate them all automatically as citizens, especially if the citizenship wasc^ted to their birth, would cause difficulties.    They might not want to take our^^^-ahip;   thoy might find that thoy had lost their present citizenship by having our4en&amp;bip thrust upon them.    An alternative - favoured by the Government    is to
enable a mother who has become a British Citizen, to apply for her citizenship for herchildren.    They would then take this citizenship from the date the application was granted.     This arrangement might be for a limited period, say two years;   this hasbean tho practice in othor countries which havo changed their law recently in this way(eg Canada and West Germany).j^Hffita of citizenship by descentHO, Our present law not only confines to men the right to transmit citisouship, it alsoifiposes conditions on tho transmission of citizenship.    There is no restriction on mencitiaen3 from this country transmitting their citizenship to the first generation bornabroad.    But beyond that, citizenship may be transmitted only in certain circumstancesfor instance, if the father is in British Government Service at tho time of tho child5sbirth, or if tho cliild is born in a foreign (but not a Commonwealth country) and thechildcs birth is registered, within a limited time, at a British Consulate.     There isno limit to the transmission of citizenship to further generations in those circumstances.lEhcso arrangements have grown up in a somewhat haphazard fashion, and can lead towiosialioso    It seems odd to many people that a child born in, say the USA can be givenbis father11 s citizenship by Consular registration ix his father was born abroad, but a child born in Canada in similar circumstances cannot.    A child born in Australia to afritiou diplomat who was himself born overseas acquires his father*s citizenship, but a child born there to a British businessman in similar circumstances does not.    A newcitizenship would provide an opportunity to place the rules for descent on a more^Uonal basis.^2. There ere various optionoc    At ore extreme4 if the United Kingdom were to adopt the^LS^HaHH5i2. raothod, and confer citizenship on any child whose parent was a citizensthere could be no limits on transmission- no matter how distant were the child*s directconnections with the United Kingdom.    The United Kingdom has however been traditionally^luctant to extend its citizenship in this wayj   people from this country have for atk&amp;et the last 200 years emigrated in considerable numbers, and the descendants of such&amp;6ople usually associate themselves with their country of birth, and not with the&quot;aited Kingdom.^3. Tho other extreme would be to limit citizenship to the first generation bom abroad^ not allow people born overseas to transmit their citizenship to children born
overseas.    This might be necessary if citizenship wore to carry with it the right toenter the United Kingdom.    Without such a measure there would be large and growingnumbers of people abroad who had the right to come to tho United Kingdom at any timo, buwho might have scant connection with this country.     Tho numbers would of course bo allthe greater if women as well as men could transmit their citizenship to their childrenhorn abroad.But more and more people are spending part of their careers abroad and it might seemunfair if one member of a family who happened to be born when the family was temporarilyoverseas could not transmit his citizenship when his brothers (and sisters) who were born in the United Kingdom could do so.     Difficulty would arise where such a person is in hiturn temporarily abroad serving United Kingdom interests when his children are born*Bo may have few ties with the coxuitry of his own birth, or of his children&apos;s birth.It would be natural for him to want to transmit British citizenship to his children bornOvorap,acu    Further difficulty could arise where tho person concerned had no claim tocitiaorxship of the country in which he was born ^ as is for instance invariably tho case*ith children of diplomats &quot; and so could not trancsnit the citizenship of that countryto his child even if he wished to.    The Government consider that as a general rule alew British Citizenship should not be transmitted beyond the first generation born^road, but they recognize that some circumstances might justify exceptions.^ Citj^nship by yoltmtary act^ The present arrangements for acquiring citizenship by voluntary act, for example,reSistration and naturalisation, are extremely complicated and varied.     Some people kav&apos;^ outright entitlement to registration - notably the wives of citizens of the United^aSdom and Colonies, and most Commonwealth citizens settled here on 1 January 1973*Others can be granted citizenship at the discretion of the Home Secretary, provided they^t various conditions relating to residence, good character, knowledge of English, andMentions as to residence in the United Kingdom;   theso include all foreign nationals^ those Commonwealth citizens who do not qualify for citizenship as an entitlement.(511uiere are special provisions for Pakistanis to be treated for a limited time as if they still Commonwealth citizens when applying for citizenship).    There are special^fraageaents for stateless persons, for certain Irish citizens, and for certain peoplevho have renounced citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonics9 to resume it.Secretary has virtually unrestricted powers to register any minor child ae a citizen:-:c:0f the United Kingdom and Colonies, at his discretion.

But men married to women citizens of tho United Kingdom5 Colonies have no such right to their wives&apos; citizenship;   they must apply in the&quot;8Ual way for registration or naturalisation.This runs contrary to the Government&apos;s general policy of ending discriminationQen the sexes.   But there is considerable room for argument on how changes might bee*   Registration on these grounds under the present law gives a woman the right of^ *y to the United Kingdom, and to extend the right to men in the same way would haveStable repercussions on immigration;   in particular the possibility that bogus*l8gea might thereby be encouraged cannot he ignored.   It is of interest that some^ e* countries which have granted husbands rights similar to those enjoyed by wivesacquire nationality by virtue of marriage (for example, West Germany, Denmark andhave fo^ad it necessary to place some restriction on tlie right to acquireUnship in this way, eg, by a qualifying poriod of residence.to- *veoUr possible options, with some comments on them, are given below:(i) To give men married to citizens the same entitlement to citizenship whichwomen who are married to citizens now enjoy.   This would &quot;level up&quot; thesexes by enabling a woman citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies toconfer on her foreign husband the same benefit as a man can confer on hisforeign wife, and would more adequately recognise the equal status ofwomen in marriage.   But such a provision could, as indicated abovec have some undesirable consequences.   Because any Commonwealth citizen or foreign national would be able to acquire citizenship - and the right of entry to the United Kingdom - simply through marriage tc a British citizen,there could he an encouragement to bogus marriages, particularly where aforeigner was aware of being in danger of deportation, and, more generally,to immigration with a view to marriage.   Accordingly a provision of thiskind might have to include a reserve power to refuse citizenship in certaincircumstances.(ii) To give spouses of both sexes married to citizens an entitlement tocitizenship, but make this subject to a residence requirement of perhapsthree years.4
(iii)   To treat spouses of citizens on exactly the same terms as other applicants for citizenship.    This would mean that wives would have to qualify forcitizenship in the same way that husbands do.    It might be said thatmarriage should not of itself entitle anyone - male or female - to take his or her spouse&apos;s citizenship particularly if the marriage no longersubsists, and that we should not assume that a spouse is automaticallyfitted for citizenship or that he or she is prepared to identify withthis country; but that spouses of each sex should be treated on their merits.(iv)   To treat spouses of citizens on the same terms as other applicants forcitizenship, but to give both sexes some concession in the matter of residence - perhaps by requiring only three years instead of the fivedemanded of other applicants for naturalisation.   This would ensure thatmarriage to a citizen brought a real advantage without giving the unqualifiedentitlement which at present is conferred on women but not on men.This would be broadly in line with the approach which has been adoptedby a number of other countries which have recently revised their nationalitylaws.
rel^j^lg^ighip by naturalisation^9.      Under our&apos; present law, foreign nationals who seek naturalisatihave to satisfy the Home Secretary, amongst other things, that they have. resided here for at least five years in all;   that they are of goodcharacter;   that they have a sufficient knowledge of English;   and thatthey intend, once naturalised, to remain here or linked to British inte-resabroad.     Many Commonwealth citizens have an entitlement to citizenshipand have to show only that they have been ordinarily resident hero for five years.   Eut increasing numbers are having to meet roughly the samerequirements as for naturalisation (Commonwealth citizens apply for regi-stration, not naturalisation).     There is no appeal against refusal of either naturalisation or registration.50.      There are three aspects of the procedure on which the Governmentwill particularly welcome views - the good character requirement, the language test and the absence of an appeals system.Good character51.      The requirement that applicants for naturalisation must be of goc-5.character is long-established.   Over the years, records of what consti-tutes good character have been carefully kept, and the doctrine has been modified from time tc time as society&apos;c views of acceptable behaviour andattitudes have changed.   But the requirement is imprecise.   It is after-all easier to say that someone is of good character than to analyse why this is so.     Different people are bound to have different views of whatconstitutes good character.     Every effort is made to treat applicantsconsistently and fairly xn this matter, but it is not always easy to administer the good character requirement satisfactorily.52.       But, equally, it is not easy to devise an adequate substitute.One way would be to limit consideration of character to criminal andfinancial matters.   It might be said that someone was acceptable fornaturalisation who had never been convicted of a criminal offence (withsome exceptions);   who was not awaiting trial for any offejfe.ee;   and whowas not an undischarged bankrupt or a person barred from acting as a director under the Companies Act.     The excepted criminal offences mightbe first, those which are &quot;spent&quot; under the Rehabilitation of Offenders
Act 197^;   and, secondly, offencee which led to a custodial sentence ofmore than 30 months (and which cannot therefore be &quot;spent&quot; under the197&apos;t- Act) where the applicant completed his sentence not less than 10years before applying for naturalisation.53* But there would obviously have to be some reserve power to dealwith applicants who were unsuitable on grounds of national security orthe preservation of law and order.5k,      Even so, an objective test like criminal offences has its draw-backs.   It cannot measure for instance whether a man&apos;s general behaviourmakes him unacceptable to his fellow-citizens, even though he may havekept free of tho Courts.   And, if a man makes himself unacceptable tohis fellow-citizens in this way, he may be a full citizen in law but hewill be a second-class citizen in fact.   He will not enjoy the equalstatus that, by and large, naturalised citizens now possess and theprocess of naturalisation may be devalued.   Perhaps more sophisticatedobjective tests are needed, or the concept of good character - loose andvague as it is - should be retained.   The Government will welcome viewson this matter.Language tost55.      The present law requires that applicants for naturalisation shouldhave a sufficient knowledge of EnglishCcr, for discretionary registration,which was introduced in 1973. English or Welsh).     Nowadays, it is usually sufficient for the applicant to have an adequate command ofspoken English.     Such factors as the age and ability of the applicantare taken into account in assessing this.   Host countries have similarprovisions in their naturalisation laws.     It is after all difficult fora naturalised citizen to exercise his civic duties and, for Instance,vote or sit on juries, if he does not understand the language of hisadopted country.     It is difficult indeed for him to be accepted as a sufficiently integrated member of our society if he cannot communicate with his fellow citizens.   Some knowledge of the language is moreoversome indication that the applicant has committed himself to living heroand talking part in the life of the community.
\intentions.v Applicants who were refused on security and similar grounds could notcase be given a right of appeal, because of the difficulty of disclosing in publicformation that had led to the refusal.&apos;  Against this however, it is argued that elderly applicants in particular, can finddifficult to meet the language test.   They may lead restricted lives, largely amongst^ir ovm fellow-countrymen, and the range of civic dxities that they are likely to be&quot;aUed upon to perform will be correspondingly restricted.   They may, nonetheless, be^PUa to acquire citizenship, particularly if they are stateless or of uncertaintonality.   One solution might be to keep the language test but give the Home Secretary&quot;0:!le discretion to waive it in such cases.^ PJjeals system as mentioned above, those who are refused citizenship by registration or naturali-AOn cannot at present appeal against the refusal.   Admittedly, a decision to refusei2enship usually has little immediate impact on the everyday life of the applicant;&quot;*0es not affect his ability to stay in this country, and he is free, for instance to-   Property.   But refusal might prevent someone from entex-ing a post, such a3 thoseCivil Service, which are restricted to those holding certain nationalities.   of appeal could offer some help in such a case.SB. ftun the other hand it i3 questionable whether it would be apt to have an appealyjJtem jjf g.op;j cnaracter, assessed in each case by analysing all the factors involved,,    xo remain the criterion for citizenship.   The diversity of circumstances encountered^ ^Plications is very wide.   The judgements which have to be made in thi3 area areentiaUy subjective, and matters of this kind are not easily justiciable. It is for&quot;Sj-deration how far it would be an improvement to substitute the views of adjudicatorsw&quot;?se of the Home Secretary and his advisers.   Under the present system the standards^Ued i21 the generality of cases can be, and are, modified, and exceptions made to&apos; where this seems justified.   But if good character wa3 replaced by objective testsScope of the right of appeal would be small.   The only issues that would then cocs. ^ appeal would be the length of an applicant&apos;3 residence in this country or his
Dual Nationality59.   United Kingdom law contains no bar on the holding of dual nationality.   of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who have other citizenships, someWe obtained them by naturalisation in other countries, but the majority have thorn^ reason of their descent.   In particular, the close links between families in &quot;the^ited Kingdom and the Irish Republic have led to much dual citizenship.   Most otherCountries place restrictions on the holding of other citizenships in addition totheir own.   Nearly all Commonwealth countries, for instance, withdraw citizenshipfrom those who voluntarily acquire the citizenship of another country, taking theview that those who of their own free will acquire the citizenship of another country should lose their original citizenship since they have sought and obtained theProtection of another State.   Some of these countries made provision to this effect0n first attaining independence, while others which formerly allowed their citizensto hold another nationality have changed their law.   Equally many countries requireApplicants for naturalisation to renounce their former nationality as evidence of theiCofflraitment to their new country.   Others extend the ban on dual nationality further,to those who have acquired it involuntarily - say through parents of different^tionalities who are both able to transmit &quot;heir citizenship.   Usually such Statesal*ow the child to remain a dual national until he is of age, and then he has to decidVfithin a specified time which citizenship he intends to hold, and renounce the other;he fails to make a choice either way he automatically forfeits the citizenship of health  country concerned.6o*   If the United Kingdom decided to tighten its law on dual nationality, there arcthus various options:-(i) a complete ban on dual nationality where it arises either voluntarily(by naturalisation etc.) or involuntarily (by descent for instance), withsome arrangement for children who are dual nationals to make a choice when they come of age;(ii) a ban on dual nationality where it arises voluntarily - our citizens who voluntarily took another citizenship would thereby lose our citizenship,and applicants for our citizenship would have to renounce any other citizenshipas a condition of becoming citizens;(iii) a ban on dual nationality only where our citizens voluntarily acquiredanother nationality (as was the practice in United Kingdom law from 1070-1948
^*   To ban dual nationality completely would be complicated and expensive.   A recordVould have to be kept of all children born both in the United Kingdom and abroad whob&amp;d another nationality in addition to ours.   When such children came of age theyWould have to be advised of the need to choose, and the time limit for doing so.     InVievr of the large numbers of people from this country living abroad^ and of people**om other countries living in the United Kingdom, this would be an immense task, and&apos;*t ig V(?ry doubtful whether everyone affected could be covered.   Tho alternative wouldbe to rely on the individual remembering to make a choice, but this could lead with&amp;rdship, where the individual inadvertently lost his citizenship by failing to do so;there would probably have to be elaborate machinery to exempt such persons, and this c-ould also be expensive.   Admittedly, there are bound to be more dual nationals iffomen are able to transmit their citizenship to their children bom abroad on the same terms as men.   But it is doubtful whether this increase would justify a complete ban11 dual nationality and all its attendant problems.   After all, most of the children0rft abroad to British women will probably decide for themselves which nationality^ want to use.6?&quot;   A ban on dual nationality where it arises as a matter of voluntary act would not^esont so many problems.   It could indeed be part of the clearer and better defined^Ush Citizenship for which we are aiming.   Some foreign and Commonwealth citizens^Sht be reluctant to give up their citizenship on acquiring ours, though at present**ay do so automatically under their own country^ laws, but it is difficult to justify0^ setting a more severe standard for our own citizens than for foreign andOnj onweallh nationals who want to acquire our citizenship.   We should require the6aae degree of commitment from both groups.(ft*   Some concessions, however, might perhaps be made in connection with marriage, so**at, for instance, those who apply for British Citizenship or acquire another by^*tue of marriage might be allowed to keep   both their citizenships (provided the&quot;-e-v.rs 0f the other country concerned permit this).   Such persons would then still haveaQ right of entry to their own country if the marriage failed.gdyil PrivilegesAn important aspect of citizenship is the privileges associated with it.   In&quot; country the common status of British subject held in our law not onDv bv^itiSens of the United Kingdom and Colonios but by all other Commonwealth
CONFIDENTIALClUzens carries with it voting and other privileges.     There are also special^angements for citizens of the Irish Republic.     Such privileges do not stem directlyrow the law of nationality and so are not dealt with in this document.I OVERSEAS CITIZENSHIP^ANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS^5* The core of this status would bo those who have ties with an existing dependency.iac status might therefore bo conferred in the first place on those citisens of the&quot;ftitod Kingdom and Colonies born, naturalised or registered in an existing dependency0t whose fathers were so born, nationalised or registered.     Some of these people might6 eligible for Britiah Citizenship too in ono of the ways described in paragraphs 1713;   but in general only British Overseas Citizens would have a right.of entry to4 dependency so it is important that any British Citizen suitably connected with aCadency should hold British Overseas Citizenship as woll in order to secure his righ^ entry there.^ The transitional arrangements would also have to cover all other citizens of the&quot;*ited Kingdom and Colonies who do not become British Citizens.     These hold theirk*6ent citizenship for a variety of reasons.    Some have connections with the UnitedSsdom or existing dependencies, but of co remote a nature as not to bring thorn withinqualifications for British Citizenship, or those for British Overseas CitizenshipDieSgested in paragraph 66*     Most people in group, howevers would have acquired-*izsnship of the United Kingdom and Colonies through their links with a formerPudency, and would have no links by birth or ancestry with either the United Kingdomexisting dependency.&apos;* One other group of people eligible to hold British passports might also becomelUch Overseas Citizens.     These are British Protected Persons who do not becomelb)e^tiiih Citizens;   nearly all of them will be living overseas.     Their numbers will bse^ood when the United Kingdom loses its responsibility for the Solomon Islands andand the remainder would not be numerous.    With the conferment of British.Vi2enship on some British Protected persons, as suggested in paragraphs 21 and 22, oneltieh Overseas Citizenship on the remainder, the status of British Protected Personu-ld disappear.Tlie creation of a British Overseas Citizenship with no right of entry into the^^od Kingdom would not affect the responsibility which the Government has assumed
CONFIDEWTIAAwards holders of United Kingdom passports from East Africa, and tho special voucherscheme would continue.feglSH OVERSEAS CITIZENSHIPjggHANENT ARRANQEMEHTSjfeiking the citizenship to the right of entry to a dependency68. The arrangements for acquiring British Overseas Citizenship after a newoitizenship scheme came into force - by birth, descent or voluntary act - might be so&quot;Wax that we eventually reach a state of affairs in which British Overseas CitizenshipVomd be derived solely from connection with the dependencies which still exist, and^uld confer the right of entry to one of them.    If this is not done, there will stillb* many British Overseas Citizens scattered over the world in a hundred years&apos; time whoWe the right of entry neither to the United Kingdom nor to a dependency.     The rules** acquiring and transmitting British Overseas Citizenship would have to take account*t the difficulties faced by dependencies and tho pressure on their resources, which nethey can give the right of entry only to those who have very close tics with thea.V could not radically alter their arrangements;   there could not, for example, be anNerstanding that a British Overseas Citizen could go to live in any dependency he nigh-:choose unless he had such ties with it.65. Accordingly it seems inevitable that the standards for British Overseas Citizenshipshould differ from those for British Citizenship.    British Citizenship cculd not be quoted so as to follow the limits proposed for British Overseas Citizenship;   the- Se of British Citizenship could hardly be determined by the limits placed bytendencies on these with a right of entry to thorn.    On the other hand it would beVtlecs to provide that British Overseas Citizenship should follow British Citizenshipln all respects.     To do so would simply mean that some people who would acquire BritishVeeas Citizenship, for example through birth to a woman from a dependency, would findV they had no right of entry to the dependency from which their status was derived,hoover if British Overseas Citizenship is to be confined to those who &quot;belong&quot; to thetendencies, the arrangements for holding it must reflect the outlook and attitudes oftho peoples of the dependencies, and these are bound to differ from those of tho people&apos;0f the United Kingdom.?0&apos; In general, therefore, the long term aim ought to be to confine British OverseasCltizenship to those with a right of entry to a dependency.    To take first of all the
CONFIDENTIALarrangements for transmission of citizenship, it ought not to pass automatically to a*Ud horn outside a dependency unless the father is a citizen by birth, registration0* naturalisation in an existing dependency.     This would of course mean that some british Overseas Citizens would be able to transmit citizenship to their children while,others would not.    There could be some minor exceptions to tho general rule.     Forexample, it might be right to include a provision for conferring citizenship on thestateless child of a man who is a British Overseas Citizen, once the child had established a direct connection with a dependency by living there for, cay, 3 years.5econdv women from tho dependencies might only be able to transmit citizenship to their*ildren born abroad where the child was illegitimate.     This is because dependencies&quot;light be reluctant to grant the right of entry to the legitimate child from abroad when01% the mother was a British Overseas Citizen but the father was not.     Third, there**uld probably have to bo an arrangement to meet obligations to grant citizenship (on**tain conditions and in certain circumstances) to wives and stateless children,^though these obligations would have to be taken into account they should notBiSnificantly weaken the general principles underlying the citizenship.H. It would also be necessary, because of the need to relate British Overseas^tiaenship to tho right of entry to a dependency, for the arrangements forhatNr&amp;lieation in the dependencies to remain much the same as at present, the applicantng to fulfil certain minimum requirements of residence etc, but beyond that the granOfnaturalisation being entirely at discretion^^STATUS OF THE IRISH*% In general, Irish citizens born before 19^9 were also British subjects in our law^il the Act of 19&apos;.l8 came into force.     Since then, those Irish citizens have been^igible to claim, by means of written notice to the Home Secretary, to remain BritishObjects under a special provision of the Act.    Within a new nationality scheme theyOould continue to be eligible to hold British passports.     They and other Irish citizensin the United Kingdom would be eligible on the same terms as citizens of^on wealth and foreign countries to apply for British Citizenship.Fusion,\TS*he Government think that change on the general lines set out above would offer ac rational basis not only for citizenship but also for immigration control.     In timecomplex distinctions that now govern the right of entry to the United Kingdcm would
Reappear mid citizenship v;ould become the test.     Tho people of the United Kingdomv,Quld enjoy a more meaningful status than at present, and the present inequalitiesbetween men and women in our nationality law would bo removed.1h. Overseas there are some different considerations to be taken into account.     Thosecitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies and other persons eligible to hold BritishReports now alive who do not have ties with the United Kingdom or an existingpendency would, as British Overseas Citizens, continue to bo eligible for BritishIfcssports during their lifetimes (or until thoy took another citizenship voluntarily).fiut. because of the restrictions on acquiring this status after the scheme started,their numbers would not grow as at present.75. Those who have close ties with our remaining dependencies would hold a citizenshiptijat properly reflected this relationship.Th0 ideas in this paper are put forward as a basis for discussion.    Tho Government*e not bound by them nor committed to thorn in their present form.    But it hopes thattltey will provide a framework for the full and informed public discussion that theseCoa3plox issues merit.f
