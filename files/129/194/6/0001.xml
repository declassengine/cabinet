dqcumenx is thePROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 6 COPY NO       gg21 January 1977CABINETLEGISLATION ON HUMAN RIGHTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentPRODUCTIONIn June 1976 my predecessor published a discussion document^nalysing the implications of general legislation on human rights.    When theCabinet agreed to its publication (CM(76) 8th Conclusions, Minute 4) we hadmind the need to head off Lord Hailsham&apos;s proposal for the reference of***d Wade*s Bill of Rights Bill to a Select Committee.    Lord Wade has eintroduced ^s        *^-s Session and, as the Second Reading debate is toon 3 February, the time is opportune for us to discuss -i. Whether we are ready to take any further our ownconsideration of the question of principle.ii. What line the Government spokesman should take in the debate on 3 February, and, in particular whether we shouldacquiesce in Lord Wade&apos;s Bill being referred to a Select Committee.2.        -cFollowing the publication of the discussion document, and moreCQ^ently in response to my minute of 26 November 1976, a number of my^    eagues have minuted the Prime Minister expressing their general views and^S SU^ect*    1* seems clear that none of us wants to start from scratchent ^Faw UP our 0wn Purely domestic Bill of Rights, or to attempt toj     ench human rights against change by the ordinary processes ofinclS^at^0n* c^v*s*on *s between those like myself who favour theRi ,rP0rat^on into our domestic law of the European Convention on Humanshts and those who favour the status quo.CASE FOR AND AGAINST incorporation in favour of incorporation it can be argued that:
a. It would bring our domestic law into line with our international obligations:  the Convention has been binding on us forthe past 24 years and we should not be assuming any newobligations.b. By giving our courts jurisdiction to deal with breaches of theConvention as such we should be discharging better our obligation under Article 13 which requires us to provide an effective remedy for such breaches;  complaints could be dealt with at home withoutthe international notoriety involved in recourse to Strasbourg.c. Incorporation would bring our law broadly into line with thatof most other European Economic Community (e.c.) countries - all except Denmark and the Irish Republic.d. Incorporation would meet the demand made in the context of devolution for a minimum standard of human rights enforceablethroughout Great Britain.    (The recent commitment by theConservative Party to a Bill of Rights in the devolution context is relevant. )e. As regards Northern Ireland, it would coincide with thecourse likely to be recommended by the Standing advisory commission on Human Rights, and fulfil our commitment to eventuallegislation on human rights covering that part of the United Kingdom.f. Incorporation of the European Convention might forestallpressure for a more radical and entrenched Bill of Rights.On the other hand, the disadvantages include:a. Uncertainty about the effects of incorporating into our lawan instrument which is subject to the evolutionary interpretation ofthe Strasbourg authorities.b. The change in the relationship between Parliament and thecourts which would result, and the risk that the courts would be faced with difficult problems of interpretation in highly sensitivefields which would tend to make the judges the focus of political controversy.c The undesirability of starting another major constitutionaldebate while we are still engaged in devolution.d. Doubts about whether the rights conferred by the convention should be enforceable only against the State or against public corporations, local authorities and private companies and individuals.2
e. Special difficulties which might arise in certain fields -eg. Service discipline.f. The increased burden on both courts and GovernmentDepartments which could have substantial manpower and public expenditure implications which cannot be reliably predicted atpreoent.TIMING AND TACTICSThere is considerable pressure in some quarters for a strengthening of the individual citizen&apos;s defences against abuse of authority.    The^corporation of the European Convention would be one way of responding tothis pressure and showing that the Labour Party, which has historicallystood for the advancement of human rights, is still concerned with theProtection and enhancement of individual liberty.    Nevertheless, I acceptthe force of some of the objections to which my colleagues have drawn attention.    The attitude of the judiciary in recent cases compounds the*ears of those who are apprehensive about possible changes in the relationship between Parliament and the courts.    I recognise the^fficulties in taking a decisive view at the present time.    It would in anypase be impossible to introduce legislation to incorporate the Conventionln the current Session.    In these circumstances I believe that the right course is to accept that no immediate action is possible in this field, butto keep the matter under review, to encourage continued public discustsionand not to close the door on the possibility of incorporation at a later date.Meanwhile, we need to decide immediately what line the government spokesman should take in the debate on 3 February in dealing with-Lord Wade&apos;s Bill and with Lord Hailsham&apos;s proposal to refer the Bill to* Select Committee.    There is little we can do to prevent this proposallo&apos;Ttl ke*nS carried, even though it means that we shall be in danger ofSlng the initiative and may eventually be faced with recommendations0rn the Select Committee going further than we wish, in the direction of,example, entrenchment or a home-made Bill of Rights.    I do not thinkwould serve any useful purpose to oppose reference of the Bill to a*elect Committee.I recommend that the Government spokesman should welcome theate as continuing the process of public discussion for which we haveed, and say that the Government will take full account of the views-*Pressed.    He should expose the advantages and disadvantages ofr i rP0ration, referring in particular to the fundamental question of theen   . 0nship between Parliament and the courts.    He should say that an^^ry by a committee, guided by the analysis offered in our discussionsi^111116^&apos; may well be of practical value in rehearsing arguments on bothes and clarifying the issues, but make it clear that the Government willClde in due course what action, if any, should be taken.3
conclusion in the light of the foregoing considerations I invite my colleagues toagree:a. that we should defer a decision about Government legislation on human rights, but keep the matter under review;  and b. that the Governments response to the debate on February should be as proposed in paragraph ^ above.M RHome Office21 January 19774
