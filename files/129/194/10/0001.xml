ACT:SAFETY REPRESENTATIVES AND COMMITTEESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Employmentl.        On 18 November 1976 the Cabinet decided CM(76) 32ndthat the regulations proposed by the Health and Safety C-.aon (HSC^should not be brought into effect in 1977-78 and that I should discusswiththe HSC and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) possible ajrangemens forPhasing the regulations in at a later date.    I was also asked to considerthe possibility that some parts of the -g^ons might be introduced atmuch lower costs and that means should be found to avoid the possibledanger of abuse in a minority of cases.2-        The Prime Minister discussed this matter^with *e, TUCon1 December.    I subsequently had discussions with the HSC.    It is Cle*at HSC (including both TUC nad the Confederation of British ^ustries(CBI) representatives) are firmly opposed to phasing5 xn the -gulaUonaud that attempts to amend the regulations now would fatally prejudice theGlance which has been achieved between union and employer interests.Further details of my discussions are set out in Annex I.3- Meanwhile, we are coming under increasing P^38^6^^^regulations,     Parliamentary opinion is hostile to us, P&quot;*c** * *^*gQur own backbenchers.    Unions are angy at the delay and are likely toP^ss employers including some local authorities for arrangements at^ast as far-reaching as those envisaged in the ProPose%ref^0^;omI^ttecf*ilure to respond could well lead to industrial action.    The TUC &quot;Jo call a full scale conference soon if no progress is made.    I find it^hardbelieve that we should wish to drift into a situation of outright conflict withthe TUC on such an issue at the present time.4-        In all these circumstances I am strongly of the view that the onlyfusible way to proceed is for me to make the regulations now with aflayed date for implementation.    Annex I sets out the and^ther consideration that has been given to the financial impU^scusses how to inform the Local Authority Associations of a decision tomake the regulations.
I recommend that:-a. I should introduce the regulations immediately with adelayed date for implementation;  this might be 1 October 1978.b. I should find the local authorities&apos; costs of  12 million for the period October 1978 to April 1979 from savings in my own area.c. We should inform the Local Authority Associations ofour intention before an announcement is made and tell themthat we will consider the question of costs through the normalRate Support Grant procedures.A Bdepartment of Employment24 january 19772
confidential annex IHEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ETC ACT:SAFETY REPRESENTATIVES AND COMMITTEESNote by the Department of employment      The Prime Minister,  with other Ministers,  received a delegation from the TUC on 1 December.    The TUC expressed in strong terms their concern at the delay in making the regulations and made clear thatthey regarded their early implementation as part of the Social Contract.The Secretary of State subsequently discussed all aspects of theproblem with the Health and Safety Commission.    In particular,  heraised with them the possibility of phasing in the regulations insuch a way that the most dangerous areas of employment were coveredfirst and the rest brought in later.    This might be done by implem-enting the regulations in respect of employees covered by the FactoriesAct now;    in respect of those covered by the Offices,   Shops and railway Premises Act later;    and by including all other employeesas soon as it was practicable.    This proposal was firmly and unanim-ously opposed by the Commission.    Both TUC and CBI representativesargued that it would not have the effect of concentrating on areasof special risk - there were many such outside the Factories Act&apos;sarea;    that it would single out some employees,  particularly in private industry,  for protection and exclude others;    and that itwould create considerable confusion,  since in a single negotiatinggroup some employees would be covered by the regulations and others not.2      The Secretary of State also raised with them the possibility of amending the regulations in such a way as to make their applicationless rigorous in workplaces which are by their nature reasonably safeand also to avoid abuse by those who are prepared to take advantageQf them.    The Commission replied that the basic concept of their proposals is that the arrangements for their implementation shouldDe agreed between individual employers and their recognised tradeUnions as appropriate to the particular circumstances of each case,^o that extent the proposed regulations,   supported by detailed Code0f Practice and comprehensive guidance notes,  would act as a safe-Suard against unreasonable behaviour.     In the long discussions inthe Commission on the regulations it had been found quite impracticable to make provision in them for individual circumstances.    Representationshad been made to  the Commission for a variety of changes which wouldWe been helpful in different kinds of working conditions.    The onlyPQssible solution to this situation was to devise a framework whichVould act as a final protection for employees if satisfactory arrange-^nts could not be made through the normal joint consultationjJrocedures.    Attempts to amend the regulations now would destroy thea*ance between the legitimate interests of the union and employerrePresentatives on the Commission and the long and laborious process0^ reaching agreement would have to begin again.The Commission also referred to the guidance which the TUC are^rePared to issue to unions in local government and which served as&quot;e basis for the discussions held between representatives of the tuc and Local Authority Associations which led to the reduction in the
estimates of cost.    This guidance was referred to in CP(76)l03but not circulated to Cabinet;    a copy is now attached (Annex 2).It will be clear from the document that the TUC are prepared topres:s unions to interpret the regulations and the Code of practice in a sensible way and it seems highly probable that this approachwill be far more productive than any attempt to amend the regul-ations to suit particular circumstances.k       It is quite clear from the discussion with the members of theCommission that the political difficulties into which the delay inmaking the regulations has brought us will not be overcome by eitherphasing or amending the regulations.    Meanwhile Parliamentary opinion is growing increasingly hostile on the issue and was sharplyreflected in the PLP Employment Group,   in a consolidated funddebate and in recent Parliamentary Questions.    Moreover,   the TUChave indicated that they are very concerned about the situationwhich has been created among trade unions in the public sector,and particularly those recognised by the local authorities,  as aresult of the  failure to  implement the regulations.    These unionsregard the local authorities as entirely responsible for the delay and are particularly incensed by the assumption,  on which it seemsto them that their estimates of costs are based,   that public sectortrade unions will exploit their rights irrespective of the circum-stances.    The  existing momentum amongst trade unions to establisharrangements for their involvement in the measures necessary toimprove and safeguard the standards of health and safety at workwill not now be halted by the absence of regulations.    All thatthe absence of regulations might do,  particularly in the public sector where the mood of anger is strongest,   is to encourage heavypressures on employers to make more onerous and expensive con-cessions than those envisaged in the proposed regulations.    Themood is such that failure to respond to those pressures could,  inmy opinion,  lead to  serious dispute situations and resort to industrial action.  Indeed the TUC now has a firm commitment tocall a full scale conference of affiliated unions soon if no pro-gress is made.    They will try to avoid this as long as possible but it is doubtful whether they can resist these pressures if adecision is still not announced by the end of this month.    this could be highly embarrassing at a time when the Government isopening discussions on incomes issues within the framework of theSocial Contract.     In all these circumstances the only sensible wayto proceed appears to be to make the regulations now with a delayeddate for implementation.    This is what the TUC want and they areprepared for quite a long delay if they can get agreement on it.They may well accept 1 October 1978 as the date.    If this were regarded as reasonable in principle there are two main problems to consider:    first,   the financial implications,  particularly for local authorities;   and,  arising out of this,  the way in which we8hould info rm the Local Authority Associations of our decision.Financial Implications5      If October 1978 were the date for implementation the part-yearcosts would fall in the financial year 1978-79 and the full-yearcosts in 1979-80 and subsequent years.    EC(7o)l03 recorded theagreement of officials that although Local Authority Associationshad reduced their estimates of costs for a full year from  88&quot;dllion to  4^ million,   a more realistic estimate would be
 23 million for England and Vales and  2.5 million for Scotland.It would therefore be reasonable to take a figure of  12 million for local authority costs from October 1978 - April  1979-    It isnot :easy to see where such resources are to be found,  particularly since difficult decisions have just been reached on expenditure inthe year in question.     It does not seem reasonable in principle&apos;that the Department of Employment should be required to  findresources to meet what are in effect local authority staff expensesover a wide area of different functional activities.    However,the Secretary of State is so  convinced of the importance of reachingquick agreement with the TUC that he is prepared to find this  12million from savings in his own area of responsibility.    As for later years,   the public expenditure programmes in 1979-80 and thereafter have not yet been reviewed in the light of the recentreductions for 1977-78 and 1978-79.    Until the  1977 PE Survey iswell advanced it will not be possible to  see how the extra costs of the regulations to local authorities can be dealt with.Arrangements with local authorities6       There is still a wide gap between the cost estimates produced by the Local Authority Associations and those of the relevantDepartments.    There seems little prospect of the local authoritiesreducing their estimates further at this stage and no doubt theywill also continue to say that extra PESC and RSG provision mustbe made to cover the full amount of their costs.    One advantage ofimplementation at a date nearly two years ahead is the opportunitythat it will provide to monitor schemes for the appointment of safety representatives and the setting up of committees which arealready in being in private industry and some local authority areas.It may well be found that the local authority estimates are indeedexaggerated and the provision for later years will turn out to beeven less than the full  25-5 million suggested by officials.     Inthe meantime it seems highly unlikely that agreement would be reached with the Associations however long the argument continued.    On theassumption therefore that a decision to make the regulations forth-with must be announced in the next week or two - and this is aslong as it  seems likely the TUC can restrain the unions -  there appears to be no alternative but to impose on the Associations theestimates which Departments believe to be realistic.7       There seem to be two ways in which this might be done.     Ifauthority is given now to make the regulations with an operative date of October 1978 the Associations could be informed of this intention before an announcement is made and told that the questionof costs will be considered through the normal RSG procedures.The announcement would not,  however,  be delayed on that account.An alternative would be to discuss the matter with the Associationsthrough the normal consultative machinery,   inform them of the sumwe are setting aside,  and delay the announcement until thereafter.There is a good deal to be said in favour of the first alternativealthough the second would be more in keeping with present practice.These procedures might,  however,  prevent us from announcing a decisionfor so long that the TUC would not be able to withstand the pressure for a special conference.ysEBEwnriAL
CONFIDENTIALTRADES UNION CONGRESSANNEX IIGUIDANCE TO UNIONS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THE APPOINTMENT OF SAFETYREPRESENTATIVES UNDER THE PROPOSED SAFETY REPRESENTATIVE AND SAFETYCOMMITTEE REGULATIONSINTRODUCTION1   This document  sets out guidance to unions and their representatives in local government about the  implementation of the system of safetyrepresentatives  as outlined by the HSC1s proposed Regulations,   Codeand Guidance notes.    This  guidance has been agreed by all the unions in local government through the TUC Local Government Committee.2   The Health and Safety Commission has not laid down rigid structuresor minima concerning the numbers of safety representatives,   but haspreferred to  adopt a flexible approach which will allow unions toappoint suitable numbers  of representatives according to  the particular circumstances of their industry,   and the places of work frequented bytheir members.3   The HSC has  stated on a number of occasions that the system of safetyRepresentatives is expected to be merged with and to work withinexisting industrial relations  systems in the UK.    Accordingly,  unions are expected to  appoint  their safety representatives bearing in minddieting patterns of industrial relations,  particularly at local levels.In addition,   the HSC in paragraph  3 of its proposed Code has recommendedthat any difficulties concerning the  implementation of the regulations should be resolved through existing industrial relations machinery.^   In drawing up the guidance  set out below,   the unions  in local-  govern-&quot;&quot;ent have followed the HSC&apos; s advice,   but they have been conscious  thataity advice must  take account of the wide variety of occupations,  work-Places and their hazards,   the numbers of unions involved and the need^0r safety representatives  to receive union training to  enable them tocarry out their  safety functions.     Given this wide variety of circum-stances,  it is impracticable to lay down rigid guidelines for the appointment of safety representatives  to be followed in every case.     The unionsltl local government do,   however,  believe that there  are a number ofaPproaches to  the issue of. appointment of safety representatives whichare not mutually exclusive and which may be adopted at local levels.5Inaddition to  the guidance given below,  unions and their representa-lves will bear in mind that in all work-places,   groups of members who^c exposed to particularly severe work-related hazards may merit  theaPPointment of separate  safety representatives.     Such groups mayltlclude technicians in FE laboratories,  maintenance workers involvedlri stripping and installing asbestos insulation and other groups.^gLE-UNIQN WORKPLACES6  T,  J-n straight-forward single-union situations imions  should,   at least* ytially,  give the additional functions of safety representatives to-&quot;-sting shop stewards or branch officials.    There are a number ofantages here,   in that  existing shop stewards or branch officials:
haveand practice,   and union structures;cust0 responsibility and accountability within existing rules(c)    hVitv,    aVe ongoing experience in dealing in industrial relations mattersn plovers;U)rerir^      en have relationships  and communication structures with otherailves of their own union and other unions;     andU)    aiready have responsibility for all working conditions.^^IQJLSITUATIONS^   ^here^ay ^e      are many instances in local government,  however,  when there&quot;&quot;ay v     ore  than one union in a work-place.    The types of situation^Soti f-W1dely!     in some cases,   the unions may all cover  the samerepx-es group  (for  example,   there may be more than one union&quot;^y bg611^1&apos;&apos;11&apos;^&apos; manual workers in a depot),  while in other cases  there65c unpiea nuil)ber of negotiating groups in the same establishment   (foretnPloye&apos;  ln Schools not only teachers but also manual and non-manuales will need to be  covered under the safety regulations).tives ?f*ragraphs 6,   7,   and 8 of its Guidance Notes on Safety Representa-e Health and Safety Commission has  stated:&quot;(6)    The Commission expect that  ....  unions would normally appoint representatives to represent a group    or groups of workers of a class for which theunion has negotiating rights.     The limitations of representation to  a particular group or groups  shouldnot,  however,  be regarded as a hindrance to  the raising by that i-epresentative of general matters affecting the health and safety of  employees as awho1e.( 7 )     Equally,   these  general principles  do not preclude the possibility of a safety representative representingby mutual  agreement between the appropriate unions,more  than one group or groups of employees   (eg in asmall workplace or within the organisation of a  small.ernployer when the number  of recognis ed  trade unions  ishijgh relative to  the  total numbers  employed)(8)    When consideration is being given to  the numbersof safety representatives to be appointed in a par-ticular case the guidance given by the Commission inParagraph. 3 of the Code of Practice  should be borne inmind.    Appropriate criteria would include:(a) the total numbers  employed;(b) the variety of different occupations;(c) the  size of the workplace and the variety of workplace locations;(d)the operation of shift  systems;     and(a)^efin    6 a^ready elected and/or appointed as representatives ofed&quot; groups of members:
(e)     the type of work activity and the degreeand   character of the inherent dangers&quot;.9   In the manual  sector,   joint  shop steward committees consistingof representatives of more than one recognised union may already exist.Similarly,   in non-manual areas  there may be local joint union committees or staff sides.    Where  such bodies  exist,   they should  nominate  safetjrrepresentatives in the light of the guidance from the HSC set out  inparagraph 8 above.10   In situations where no  such joint union bodies  exist,   local union representatives and officials are advised to set up ad hoc jointunion bodies  for the purpose of appointing safety representatives.The areas to be covered by such joint union bodies would vary accordingto their circumstances.     They could be authority-wide in scope,   atleast in districts,   or could be restricted to a single large  establish-ment.    A range of alternatives lies between these two  extremes,   and unions locally should jointly decide on the best arrangements  to  suittheir own circumstances.11   Existing or ad hoc  joint union bodies will be expected to  appointsafety representatives  to represent groups of employees for which asafety representative1s union might not be recognised by a localauthority for industrial relations puposes.    The unions  expect localauthorities to co-operate in recognising these arrangements.12   In primary schools,   libraries,   small offices and small depots,   itwould be sensible for local union representatives  to  agree that  thereshould only be one safety representative for the whole of the work-force.    In secondary schools,   further  education colleges,   large offices and large depots,   it would be impracticable to  expect any one safetyrepresentative  to  cover all hazards which might arise.     In secondary schools,  one  safety representative could be appointed for teachingstaffs who form the majority of employees  in terms of numbers,   andone for remaining staffs who  are fewer in numbers but whose activities are more vai^ied.     Similar arrangements could apply in offices -  forexample,  one safety representative for the non-manual grades and one for the manual grades.13   Where difficulties  arise between unions locally,   as to the best course to follow,   either in setting up  joint union bodies,   or in appoint-lftg safety representatives,   local union representatives  should seek the&apos;&quot;rice of their relevant  full-time officials.(
