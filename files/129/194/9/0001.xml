document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government cp(77) 9 copy no oft19 January 1977cabinetINDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACYNote by the prime minister attach for the consideration of the Cabinet a draft of the statement to be made on the publication of the Bullock Report on industrial democracy.L J C10 Downing Street19 January 1977
With permission I should like to make a statement on industrial democracy.      The departmental Committee of Inquiry, which was announced by my predecessor on 5 August 1975 and which came into being during December of that year under the chairmanship ofLord Bullock,  submitted its Report to me on 14 December.      I amarranging.for it to be published today and copies have beenplaced in the Library and the Vote Office.The Report of the Committee is not unanimous.      There is amajority report signed by the Chairman and six members of theCommittee, but with an important note of dissent by one of the six.      In addition there is a minority report signed by theremaining three members.      Nevertheless I welcome the work thatthe Committee as a whole has done and I pay tribute in particular to its Chairman,  Lord Bullock,  for the vast amount that hasbeen accomplished in the course of twelve months.      The Committeehas greatly advanced the consideration of this complex subject by analysing the issues and clarifying the choices.The majority of the Committee recommend the introduction oflegislation to give employees a ri^nt to representation on the boards of companies employing 2000 or more.      This right wouldbe triggered by an application from a recognised trade union,confirmed by a ballot of all employees.      The reconstitutedboard would consist of three elements,  that is to say equal numbers of employee and shareholder representatives who would co-opt a further small uneven number of directors.      Alldirectors would have the same duties and responsibilities.If the trade unions representing the employees,and the representativesof shareholders and management,  agree that other arrangements todevelop industrial democracy are more appropriate in their company,there is nothing in the majority report which would prevent theintroduction of those arrangements.The minority report favours the prior development of participationbelow board level and proposes that if employee representationis to be introduced it should be on a supervisory board in a two-tier system.      The employee representatives would notnecessarily be selected through trade union machinery.The minority report also criticises the terms of reference ofthe Committee, which presupposed a commitment to employeerepresentation on company boards.      I should therefore make itclear that the Government is committed,  as we were when we setup the Committee,  to a radical extension of industrial democracyby representation of the workforce on company boards and to theessential role of trade unions in this process.      We are therefore not able to accept, the minority report.      It is our intention toundertake consultations on the basis of the well thought outrecommendations contained in the majority report,  and to bring forward legislative proposals in this Session.      It is theGovernment&apos;s view - a view widely shared in Europe - thatarrangements for joint decision-making at all levels,  includinghoard level, will represent a fundamental change which shouldBlake a major contribution to an improvement in labour relations and industrial  efficiency.
The Government now intends to undertake consultations in orderthat as much common ground as possible may identified^   weshall be discussing the Report with the TUC and CBI and we wibe glad to receive representations from others      I      ^hope that these consultations can take place in a Positive aiinstructive atmosphere and with recognition by both siaes 01industry of the need to achieve, a lasting improvement m Britishindustrial performance.The terms of reference of the Bullock Committee were confined to private sector companies:    the legislative proposals willJlso cover companies in which the Government has a ^areholOi gThe Government has also been giving separate consideration xthe development of industrial democracy in the ^tionalisefll;dustries and has decided that employees in these ^dustrieShould be given a right to representation at board take place the private sector.    Consultations about this &quot;ij1 * rtParallel with the consultations on the Bullock report   anathe Government&apos;s conclusions will be embodied in the legislative proposals to which I have referred.y Government will also continue its considerations of what^2ht be a one to develop further industrial democracy in thePublic services   bearing in mind the unique responsibility xthoir electorate of democratically elected governments bothCentral and local.
