DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 417 January 1977COPY NOCABINET80SCOTTISH AND WELSH REPRESENTATION AT WESTMINSTERMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the PROBLEM1. It is becoming increasingly hard to temporise over the post-devolution levels of Scottish and Welsh representation at Westminster.The issue has already been brought out in debate on Clause 1 of theScotland and Wales Bill and will undoubtedly be the subject of amendmentsduring later parts of the Committee Stage and from what the Chairman ofthe Committee has already said, they will be regarded as in order and willbe debated.    But apart from the possibility of it coming to a vote later,some indication of the Government&apos;s view may be essential to securingsome other aspect of the Bill eg a timetable Motion.    It is accordinglyhighly desirable to decide what position we are to stand upon.2. I believe we will find it impossible not to consider Northern Irelandrepresentation at the same time.3- The factual background to the problem of Scots and Welshrepresentation and to possible solutions to the problem a*e set out in the note by the Constitution Unit attached to CP(77) 5.4- The problem we face is simply that, post-devolution, Scotland andWales will, in devolved matters, determine their own executive and, inScotland, their own legislation without English or Northern Irish inter-vention (reserve powers apart);  yet Scots and Welsh Members ofParliament will continue, in respect of the corresponding matters inEngland and Northern Ireland, to play an undiminished role in determining the political colour of the executive and the legislation passed.    this problem is aggravated by the arithmetical over-representation of Scotlandand Wales.    They now have 71 and 36 Members of Parliamentrespectively;  these figures compare with about 61 and 33 respectively, ifarithmetical parity with England&apos;a 516, plus an allowance for geographicalfactors, were the basis of representation.    (This would reduce the House1
to 526 Members;  on the alternative basis of keeping the size of the Houseunchanged at 635, securing parity while still allowing for the presentgeographical factor, would mean 62 Scots, 34 Welsh, 523 English and16 Northern Irish Members).5.        For the reasons set out in the annex to CP(77) 5 (paragraphs 9-11),I do not beli eve we can find a solution through &quot;in-and-out&quot; voting; the onlyprospect for change is in relative representation at Westminster.    But ourown Party interest, so far as anyone can now foresee, will best be served by the minimum change from the current relativities between the four countries.THE OPTIONS6&apos;        There are three basic options open to us:-a. to continue to stand on the status quo;b to go straight into legislation - conceivably as part of theScotland and Wales Bill - to alter, in a specific way, relativeWestminster representation;c to agree that the representation issue (covering all four countries) should be considered by the Speakers Conference ifdevolution comes into effect for Scotland and/or Wales.7-        The choice and judgments are difficult and I will report further on some of the political aspects.    But I believe the main procedure we should follow is now clear.8-        I believe it is neither equitable nor politically tenable to standrigidly on the status quo.    I therefore rule out option a.9-        To go straight to legislation without inter-Party discussion would bea strange way for a Government to proceed in such a matter.    And if we**sh the issue, in the difficult context of this controversial Bill, we shall probably get a worse outcome than if we play it long by orthodox methods.I therefore reject option b.10-       Although under option c, any recommendation from a Speaker&apos;conference is hardly likely in itself to be politically helpful to us, I believe8omething worse - a reference not conditional on devolution coming intoeffect, or even a specific change introduced into the Bill itself mU before*ced on us if we offer no concession voluntarily.    I believe we shouldd^ide now to adopt option c. and to deploy it at a moment selected to givebest advantage in relation to the passage of the Bill.
