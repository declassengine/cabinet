. __J       Annex to CP(77)5SCOTTISH AND WELSH representation in THE HOUSE OF COMMONSNote by the Constitution UnitSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSThemain conclusions of this note are:-&apos;   post-devolution there will be a significant problem through Scots MPsCQntinuing to play a role in legislation for England, Wales and Northern*reland on subjects that for Scotland will be devolved, and through Scotsand Welsh MPs continuing to have a role in relation to English &quot;domestic&quot;government (para. 8);&apos;   the logic of the situation would require an &quot;in-and-out&quot; votingar*angement (para 9);*   no form of &quot;in-and-out&quot; voting has been identified that would be suffiently consistent with basic features of our constitution to beWorkable and which would also meet the equity objective (paras 10-11);a reduction in Scottish and possibly Welsh over-representation at^westminster,while hardly a logical answer, would nevertheless be a18nificanj. gesture towards meeting the problem, would raise noinstitutional difficulties and is precedented by Northern Ireland (paras 13-15);although changes in Westminster representation could theoretically bencluded in the Scotland and Wales Bill, it would be much less controversial(e&apos; g- in relation to the definition of fresh constituencies) to refer the matter to0Peaker&apos;s Conference, where the issues could be properly discussed andect out.   In practice, it would no doubt be necessary to include in thercnce the issue of Northern Ireland representation (para 16).I.REPRESENTATIONthCrw  he Present rules for the distribution of seats derive from the House ofCns (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949.   It provides that Great Britainh&quot;Ve &quot;not substantially greater or less than 613&quot; constituencies, Scotland
CONFIDENTIAL)-1-1-W--*ti     ......nwumi w^^-    hi in Wless than 71, Wales not less than 35 and Northern Ireland 12.   It is these provisions, together with the revised arrangements for the calculation of electoral quotas provided by an amending Act of 1958, which allow   Scotland and(to a lesser extent Wales) to be over-represented.2     tv.       - -        in fnP 1949 Act for a Boundary Commission toc-    There is also a provision in tne IV *y ^ci iv*depart from the strict application of certain of the rules if &quot;special^graphical considerations, including in particular the size, shape andaccessibility of a constituency appear to them to render a departure desirable&quot;.theory at least, this provision should not increase the total number of seats** Scotland and Wales (though in practice it may have that effect).   Its primaryImpose is to allow some seats to have a smaller electorate than the averagebecause of the demands of geography.The resultant present representation is:-England 516Scotland 71Wales ^36_Great Britain 623Northern Ireland 12United Kingdom 6354On the basis of arithmetical parity with England&apos;s 516 members, Scottish-ton representation at Westminster would be reduced from 71 to 57 and fromrespectively, and Northern Irish representation increased from 12 to 16.ug for the &quot;special geographical considerations&quot; would raise some of thesesightly - perhaps to 61 for Scotland and 3 3 for Wales.   If the total,  rship of the House were unchanged at 635 the latter ratios would mean 523ngUsh rv,1 members, 62 for Scotland, 34 for Wales and 16 for Northern Ireland.J^CAL BACKGROUND&apos;e 19th century, redistributions of seats were normally associated with.     reform and extensions of the franchise.   Partial redistributions tookn 1832 and 1867-68.   A more substantial redistribution took place in 1885.-2-
(CQNFIIDEN a SAlyThese redistributions took place under separate Acts of Parliament&apos;underwhich special Boundary Commissioners were appointed.   The redistribution of 1918 had been preceded by a Speaker1 s Conference on Electoral Reform;it had recommended equality of representation so far as Great Britain was concerned and this was reflected in the 1918 redistribution.   By 1944, when anew Speaker&apos;s Conference on Electoral Reform and Redistribution of Seats wasappointed, Scotland and &quot;Wales had become over-represented, mainly because of movements in population.   However, the Conference of 1944 recommended thatthere should be no reduction in the number of seats in Scotland and Wales.The House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 broadly implementedthe Speaker&apos;s Conference^ recommendations and established a new system of regular (every 3-7 years - subsequently, in 1958, extended to 10-15 years) reviews of Westminster constituencies by permanent Boundary Commissions.6.    Northern Ireland has 12 MPs, a number deriving originally from theGovernment of Ireland Act 1920.   This Act, setting up the devolved Stormontadministration (which appears to have no prospect of early re-establishment),itself provided for a reduction in Northern  Ireland  representation  at westminster.   (Arithmetical parity with England would give Northern Ireland16 MPs).   Ministers have promised that the question of Northern Ireland numberswould be looked at again in the context of a general long-term settlement there.It would be difficult to consider altering Scots and/or Welsh representation at westminster without being prepared to look at Northern Ireland at the same time.7.    The devolution White Paper of September 1974 (Cmnd 57 32) committed theGovernment to maintaining present Scots and Welsh representation at Westminsterand that of November 197 5 (Cmnd 6348) to Scotland and Wales maintaining their&quot;full complement&quot; of Members.THE PROBLEM8. The basic problem is that, after devolution, Scotland and Wales will indevolved matters determine their own executive and, in Scotland, their ownlegislation, without English or Northern Irish intervention (reserved powers apart).
Yet Scottish and Welsh MPs will continue, in respect of the correspondingmatters in England and Northern Ireland, to play an undiminished part in determining the political colour of the executive and the legislation passed.The difficulty is particularly a^ute in relation to Scottish members becausedevolution to Scotland includes the primary legislative function.   This problem is further aggravated by the arithmetical over-representation of Scotland andWales at Westminster.9.    But in non-devolved matters, Westminsters responsibilities will continueto apply as directly to Scotland and Wales as to England or Northern Ireland,The theoretical logic of thi.s situation would therefore require some &quot;in-and-out1voting arrangement e. g. involving no change in the numbers or roles of Scottishor Welsh MPs in non-devolved matters, but for Scots MPs to play no part at allin legislation for England, Wales or Northern Ireland relating to subjects thatin Scotland were devolved.   (At the same time, Welsh MPs should play a full part in legislation relating to England, Wales and Northern Ireland (as well asUnited Kingdom legislation) but neither they nor the Scots MPs ought, in logic,to play any part in determining or controlling the &quot;domestic&quot; government for england, i. e. the government in relation to subjects which are devolved inScotland and Wales.&quot;IN-AND-OUT&quot; SOLUTIONS10.   There are two major difficulties about devising a Parliamentary procedure to detach Scots MPs from England, Wales and Northern Ireland legislation (orScots and Welsh MPs from English executive Government):-a.   It would be very difficult to identify legislation that could be said tohave no implications for Scotland.   Almost any major social legislation for England and Wales would have resource implications - and hence taxor financial priority aspects - that would also concern Scotland.   However,even if England and Wales legislation could be satisfactorily isolated,  sucha divis-i-sa could easily be evaded by the Government of the day by the
deliberate inclusion in the Bill of some provisions applying to devolved fieldsin Scotland, or to non-devolved fields;b.   the more fundamental political difficulty is that whenever the partybalance in the House as a whole (which would have therefore determined the colour of the administration) differed from the balance for England,Wales and Northern Ireland (a situation which, in effect, occurred following the 1964 and February 1974 elections) there could be deadlock between theGovernment of the day and the majority of those entitled to vote on England,Wales and Northern Ireland legislation.   The alternative approach of having a &quot;domestic&quot; government for England that reflected the party balance of english Members in the House would create, in effect, a federal structurefor the United Kingdom.11.   These difficulties, recognised by Parliament in the context of Irish home rule and later by the Kilbrandon Commission, lead to the conclusion that&quot;in-and-out&quot; voting is not workable.   It might be possible to devise some moresophisticated relationship between the House as a whole and an England-and-Walescommittee (e. g. by limiting the competence of the committee to some specifieddelay of one or two years rather than allowing it indefinitely to block a measure thatthe House as a whole were prepared to pass. )  But such devices could do nothing more than slightly reduce the sharpness of the potential deadlock and, insofar asthey were effective in restoring the position of the House as a whole, would fail tomeet the English equity difficulty.i12.  It seems very unlikely that any scheme could obscure the fundamental issuethat political procedures need to be based on a clear view as to whether theformation of the Executive for English &quot;domestic&quot; affairs and legislation for england and Wales are to be at the discretion of the House as a whole (with thedifficulties inequity that this will create, post-devolution);  or at the discretion of english and perhaps Welsh MPs (with the deadlock that this potentially creates inrelation to a Government based on the confluence of the House as a whole).
(CONFIDENTIALCHANGES IN WESTMINSTER REPRESENTATION13.      The difficulty inherent in the &quot;in-and-out&quot; approach has led to theconclusion that a reduction in Scots and perhaps Welsh representation at westminster, while not meeting the logic of the situation, is the onlyPolitically practicable step open;   it has the advantage of being precedentedby the arrangements for Northern Ireland.14.     Reliance on the Northern Ireland precedent can, however, be criticised on two grounds:-a. the scale of the Scots representation problem compared with northern Ireland (60 or more Scots MPs would be likely to havea decisive effect at Westminster more often than 12 NorthernIrish members: would) makes it more difficult to rely on a solutionthat has a very limited basis in logic.   Moreover, the acceptabilityof the &quot;reduced representation&quot; solution to the devolved territoryproblem may have reflected the comparatively low profile voluntarilyadopted by Northern Irish members, in relation to British issues,over the first 4o or so years of devolution to Northern Ireland.There seems no reason to think that Scots or Welsh members,post-devolution, would adopt a similar posture in relation to Englishaffairs.b. the big increase in the importance of legislation in social fields(i. e. largely the devolved subjects) means that the continuingparticipation of even a reduced number of Scots MPs in allWestminster legislation remains more inequitable than such anarrangement would have been in 1920.^evertheless, reduced representation appears the only workable response tothe Problem..    ) *loThe minimum reduction possible might well turn out to be parity withngland, but with an added allowance for &quot;special geographical considerations&quot;.This516.might mean,  say, 61 Scots MPs and 33 Welsh against England&apos;s presentnil application of the &quot;below parity&quot; precedent&quot; on the Northern Ireland.6-fCONFJDFNTIAI )
mm.m______... .1,1......(Confidential)scale (probably unjustified in view of the more limited devolution to scotland and Wales) would mean about 45 and 24 Scots and Welsh Members,respectively,16. Changes of this order in Westminster representation would involveamending the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949.The normal approach to this might be a reference to a Speakers Conference(although in 1920 the Government of Ireland Act itself reduced Irish represented at Westminster - but only in a way already accepted by governments for manyVaars previouslv).   Whatever course was adopted to determine the total number0&apos; seats in Scotland and Wales, the new arrangements could probably have&quot;feet only after the Boundary Commissions had produced completely newconstituency maps for both countries and any necessary further parliamentary proceedings to establish the new constituencies had been completed.   In,int affect elections until wellParticular this would mean that the changes could not affectinto the lv80&apos;s.INCLUSIONSThe logic of the Parliamentary situation, post-devolution, would point to change in the scale of representation at Westminster, but to an Hn-and-our^ing arrangement for Scots and/or Welsh Members.
