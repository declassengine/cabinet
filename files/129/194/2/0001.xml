CONFIDENTIALWHITE PAPER ON THE GOVEMENT&apos;S EXPENDITURE PLANSMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury.     In his minute to me of 20 December 1976, the Prime Ministerendorsed the view that the Cabinet&apos;s decisions on public expendi-ture for 1977/78 and 1978/79 should be published in a public expenditure White Paper as soon as technically possible.   Ienclose accordingly the first and more general part of the white paper, setting out the Government spending plans as a whole and giving both the totals and the main figures for each programme upto 1978/79.   This will be supplemented by a second volume whichwill give more detailed information on individual programmes andcontain other supporting material.   It will also include for mostitems, but on a more provisional basis, the figures for 1979/80end 1980/81 which emerged from the 1976 Survey.2.     The draft makes a number of presentational innovations,following consultation with the Expenditure Committee of theHouse of Commons, with which for the most part my colleagues arealready familiar and which they have welcomed.   These include theaew treatment of the nationalised industries, of debt interestand of total public expenditure as a proportion of GDP.   Theattention given to the part played by local authority spendingwithin total public expenditure follows a recommendation m theLayfield Report.3-     The economic rationale of our spending plans is summarised at the outset of the enclosed draft and developed more fully inthe concluding section on Public Expenditure and the Economy.T*e Expenditure Committee know that the presentation of theeconomic policy material in the White Paper is another aspect on
which we have had changes in mind, since the conventional approachhas become increasingly difficult to apply to a situation in whickboth we and the industrialised world generally are having to adjust to the disequilibrium resulting from the oil crisis and the ensuing recession.   There may well be criticism of the extent towhich we have moved away from forward projections in this particu-lar White Paper, and of the absence of a &quot;resources table&quot; for thewhole Survey period.   But it was that table in the last WhiteFaper which proved particularly unsatisfactory in the new situationEspecially as the specific decisions which we are now presentingrelate only to the next two years, I am sure that the approachadopted in this part of the White Paper is much more suitable topresent circumstances.4.     As regards the inclusion of the detailed information onprogrammes and other supporting material in a separate volume,this is something which I had in mind in any event, to facilitate the preparation of the White Paper.   It also has the advantage of presenting our main spending plans, with the principal programmefigures, in a less bulky and elaborate piece of work; it is tothis part of the White Paper that most attention is directed ingeneral discussion and in the examination of Treasury witnessesby the General Sub-Committee of the Expenditure Committee.   Thechapters on individual programmes, to be included in the secondvolume, are of more interest to the other Sub-Committees who intend to question particular spending Departments on them.5.     It would have been preferable, if circumstances had permitted,to publish all this material at the same time.   However, in spiteof the cooperation of Cabinet in completing the main expenditureexercise before our further decisions had to be taken in December- and otherwise the logjam of work would now be even more serious *if we were now to wait until all the material could be issued atthe same time, the earliest publication date would be around 22February.   This would add to the bunching of the remaining work of the expenditure front, including the preparation of Estimates andcash limits for 1977/78 and of the related Budget figures; and the2
Expenditure Committee would be the more likely to complain, asthey did last year, that they would not be able to examine theWhite Paper and issue their general report on it in good time before any debate on the White Paper and the Budget debate.   the enclosed draft, if published in advance of the supplementaryvolume, could appear on or about 27 January and, on balance, this seems the preferable course on this occasion.6.     Finally, I come to an important point of substance, that is,the size of the contingency reserve for 1977/78.   A provisionalcontingency reserve for 1977/78 was included in the last public expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 6393) and, if we set against thisall the programme changes which we have approved, the balance would be no more than around  500 million.   However, my officialsestimate that, if we adjust this figure by bringing into accountestimating changes in both directions, and allowing for revalua-tion of the Cmnd 6393 figures to take full account of costchanges, we could justify a figure of around  650 million for1977/78 at 1976 Survey prices.   On this basis, although it mightbe open to criticism as cancelling out in part the savingsannounced in December, a contingency reserve of this size couldbe defended as compatible with our declared intentions and our commitments to the IMF.7.    Our performance in containing approved additions to pro-grammes within the contingency reserve in 1976/77 has played animportant part in restoring credibility in our planning andcontrol of expenditure, and we must set out to do the same in1977/78.   But to achieve this we need to start with a contingency reserve sufficient to be viable in this operational role.   I have therefore included a contingency reserve of  650 million (at 1976Survey prices) in the total expenditure figures for 1977/78.Even so, we will have to continue to exercise the strictest stan-^ards in our choice of priorities for any additional expenditure.ve can already foresee, even before the new financial year hasParted, a number of substantial potential requirements which may become unavoidable and have to be met out of the contingency reserve. -5
conclusions.     I therefore invite the Cabinet to approve the enclosed drafton the Government&apos;s Expenditure Plans, subject to any minorrevisions which may be necessary, for publication as a white paper as soon as possible.   A second volume, dealing with individual -dual programmes in more detail, together with other supportingmaterial, is being prepared interdepartmentally, and will be circulated to Cabinet for their approval with a view to publica-tion in the latter part of February.4
PREFACEThis White Paper on the Government1s expenditure plans is being published in two volumes.    This volume gives a general account of the plans; and includes a number of presentationalchanges about which the Expenditure Committee of the Houseof Commons have been consulted.    A second volume, whichwill be published separately, will contain details of individual expenditure programmes, and other supportingmaterial.
THE GOVERNMENT1S EXPENDITURE PLANS1-     A year ago the Government published their public expenditurePlan   for the rest of this decade.   Coming after a period of years in which the increase in total public expenditure had outstrippedthe growth in national output, and during which the energy crisisand the quadrupling of oil prices had brought about a need for a radical adjustment in the economies of most other industrialised countries as well as of the United Kingdom, the plans in the 1976White Paper (Cmnd 6393) involved a levelling off of the growth in public expenditure.    The growth previously envisaged in theexpenditure programmes for the years after 1976-77 was scaled downaccordingly.   Within the revised totals room was made for effect-ive measures in support of the industrial strategy and priority*as given to consolidating social security gains.    For the mostPart further improvements had to be postponed.2-     The objectives of that plan were to make possible a shift of^sources into industrial investment and exports; to restrain theCrease in the burden of taxation which would otherwise have beenPessary, to maintain an appropriate balance between take-homeand the provision of public services; and by these meanst0 nelp to reduce inflationary pressure in the. economy.5&apos;     At the same time it was stressed that the Government wouldbe ^ady to modify the programmes then published, if this provedPessary.    In the event, the problems of achieving a sustainedShi^t int0 exports, at a time when world trade has been relativelySlo* in recovering from the recent recession, together with the***lems of financing both the internal and external deficits,CONFIDENTIAL

Anumber of measures designed to achieve the required effect so faras 1977-78 is concerned were announced in July 1976;* and further measures affecting both 1977-78 and 1978-79 were announced on15 December.**   The broad effect of these changes to the plans in cmnd 6393 is that the total for expenditure programmes and thethose years instead oicontingency reserve (but excluding debt interest) in each Q / o*inglevelled off,   is  brought down to a reduced level compared with1975-76 and 1976-77.4.     It has always been made clear, most recently   in amemorandum to the Expenditure Committee on the planning and controlof public expenditure,*** that the system of medium-termexpenditure planning requires firm programme decisions to be taken for only one year ahead, and provisional decisions for thewhich coveredfollowing year.    The 1976 survey of public expenditure,/not onlythese two years, ie 1977-78 and 1978-79, but also the twosubsequent years, was carried out on the basis of keeping totalplanned expenditure broadly within the plan envisaged in cmnd 6393.   However, the figures for 1979-80 and 1980-81 areeven more provisional than   usual, in that they were not furtherreviewed in the light of the developments which led to the measure^announced on 15 December.    The figures for these later years will___&apos;* House of Commons Official Report, 22 July 1976, Cols. 2010-20** House of Commons Official Report, 15 December 1976, Cols 1525*5&apos;
generally be shown in the individual programme tables in Part 2of this White Paper, but they are not included in this volume,and they will need to be reappraised in the next annual survey.5. The picture resulting from the decisions up to 1978-79 canbe summarised in the following table:-TABLE 1^public expenditure by: ^Central government^Public corporations otherthan the nationalisedindustriesLocal authoritiesTotal expenditure onprogrammes&apos;Qfttingency reservelebt interest&apos;3)0tal public expenditure^(1)	PUBLIC	EXPENDITURE	PLANS  million at		1976 Survey prices	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-7935,139	35,454	34,144(2)	34,8151,241	1,439	1,306	1,25515,4-36	15,005	14,102	13,86051,816	51,898	49,552	49,930		650	9001,128	1,800	2,350	2,35052,944	53,698	52,552	53,180(2)(3)(4)includes government loans and capital grants to the nationalised industries.Net of  500 million for proceeds of sale of shares in BritainPetroleum Company.The figures for debt interest in this table are on the newpresentational basis explained in paragraph 41     Figures foruebt interest on the old basis are given in table 6 on page  28.Total public expenditure, excluding government loans and capital grants to the nationalised industries, the receipts from the sales of British Petroleum Company shares and debt interest in the four years is  50.5m,  50.9m,  49.8m and 49.8m.3
6.     The Government has stressed its determination to keepexpenditure within planned levels, and has made improvements inthe field of expenditure control to this end; these include theuse of the contingency reserve as a limit within which additions to programmes during the year must be contained, and cash limits on a wide range of programmes.1975-76 AND 1976-777.     The estimates of outturn now available show that totalexpenditure on programmes in 1975-76, on the definition of programmes then in use, was a little below the estimated outturnincluded in Cmnd 6393*   Fart of the difference is accounted forby an over-estimate in Cmnd 6393 of the volume of investment bythe nationalised industries.   Expenditure on several other programmes was also over-estimated.    The main area where theactual volume of expenditure was more than anticipated was thehousing programme.    Details of the revisions to the estimatedoutturn are included in table 5 on page 27 and in table 9 onpage 31.8.     As regards 1976-77, new commitments have been containedwithin the contingency reserve provided in Cmnd 6393.    Some over-spending by local authorities on current account (compared withthe figures in Cmnd 6393) has been allowed for, partly offset by savings on their capital expenditure.    This net excess hasalso been contained within the contingency reserve.    It seems likely that the volume of central government expenditure subjectto cash limits will be somewhat below that indicated in Cmnd 6393since the general price level has risen rather more than
anticipated.    It is too soon to be sure how far this tendencyhas affected the particular purchases made by spending departments,and thus there is some additional uncertainty about the volumefigures now published.    The latest appraisal of the outturn ofthe main programmes which are not cash-limited, such as social security and refinance of export credit suggests a mixed picture.Outlay on social security seems likely to be rather below thevolume envisaged in Cmnd 6393, partly because retail prices have risen more than foreseen and partly because unemployment benefitwas over-estimated.    On the other hand, demand for the refinanceof export credit has risen faster than expected.    At this stage the total volume of public expenditure on programmes is estimated to be within the Cmnd 6393 total for programmes and contingency reserve by a margin Of about  \%J per cent, excluding from the comparison the nationalised industries for which the basis of presentation has changed.    The comparison of programmes withthose in Cmnd 6393 is in table 10 on page  32.PLANS FOR 1977-78 AND 1978-799.     Table 1 on page 3   gives a summary of expenditure plans byspending authority from 1975-76 to 1978-79; and tables 6-9 on pages 28-31 show expenditure for 1971-72 to 1978-79 oy spendingauthority and economic category, spending authority and programmemain programme and economic category respectively.10-   Full details of the changes since Cmnd 6393 are given intable 10 on page 32.    The most significant changes were themeasures announced by the Chancellor in his Budget statement inApril 1976,and in further statements on 22 July and 15 December,a number of which were designed to alleviate unemployment and toassist the industrial strategy.    There is also a revised estimateof the social security programme which now includes the net cost5
6schemeof the first phase of the child benefit/(after allowing forthe savings on tax allowances) and other changes.    This willbe covered more fully in the chapter on social security inPart 2 of the White Paper.    There are also increases in netEEC contributions, partly offset by lower expenditure on marketregulation under the common agricultural policy in the agriculture programme (programme 3)*11.    This White Paper differentiates more clearly than previousones between expenditure by the three main categories of spendingauthority:    central government, local authorities and public corporations (other than nationalised industries).   whilst the annual survey provides a framework within which the wholeof public expenditure is planned and controlled, the arrangementsfor control are different for each of the three categories of spending authority, as is the extent of the Government&apos;responsibility for management of the expenditure in each case.Many of the 15 programmes (table 8 on page 30) into which expenditure is classified include expenditure by more thanone category of spending authority.

The coverage of public expenditure, following recent changes,now corresponds more closely to the concept ofgeneral government expenditure ,that is ,the expenditure of centralgovernment and local authorities.    A good deal of the expenditureof central government is paid to local authorities as grants and loans   to help finance the services which they provide.    this expenditure*-is shown as public expenditure by local authoritiesand,to avoid counting it twice, the central government contribution is not included as such in the public expenditure figures.13.    Table 2 and table 7 on page 29 show the main services provided by central government.TABLE public EXPENDITURE BY CENTRAL GOVERNMENT  million at 1976 Survey prices-1975-76   1976-77   1977-78   1978-79Defence 5,548       5,621       5,444      5,397National health service 5,421       5,526       5,523       5,573Social security 10,799     11,168     11,659     11,910Other expenditure 13,371     13,139     11,513*   11,935
8About half of public expenditure by central government, excludingdebt interest, is on goods and services, ^principally7on defence and the national health service.    The other halfof this expenditure is on transfer payments and net lending.    Apartifrom overseas expenditure this finances private consumption and investment, and investment by the nationalised industries, and does not represent a direct use of resources by the centralgovernment.    The main transfer payments are social security benefithousing subsidies, and various forms of support for industry and agriculture.    The main items of net lending are loans to the nationalised industries and refinance of export credits.14.    In this White Paper government lending to the nationalised industries is for the first time shown as such, as part of centra-&quot;-government expenditure.    In previous White Papers the total capi*aexpenditure of the nationalised industries has been shown inprogramme 5 and included in the public expenditure totals asexpenditure by public corporations.    Under the new presentation of public expenditure, the expenditure totals now include tbeamount of government funds provided to the nationalised industrieSwhether by loans&apos;, public dividend capital. (PDC), or grant.15.    The programme chapter for nationalised industries in Part 2 0^this White Paper will show the aggregate of net government lendi11^these ^(loans and PDC) to Mn industries rather than capital investment wthem.    This will be derived by estimating the total net require^11of the industries for loans and PDC and then making certain adjusments to these figures, mainly reductions to allow for net foreig11borrowings (which is outside/^iefinition of net government lendingThis process will be described in more detail in Part 2.    Grants  ^will be included in the industry and transport programmes (prograE14 and 6).    These will include some capital grants to the nationalised industries, which have not been treated in this way 1past White Papers, because they helped to finance the investment
programmes previously included in programme 5 and so were countedin public expenditure as part of that programme.    Cash limits willcontinue to be applied, as in 1976-77, to the total externalfinancing requirements of the nationalised industries, includingtheoverseas borrowing.//A special section on/nationalised industries will also be  included in Part 2 of the White Paper,describing the investment programmes of the industries as theyused to be shown in programme 5-    A review of these investment programmes will continue to be made as part of the annual surveyto determine the prospective demand on real resources which theywill generate.   There will also be tables showing how thecapitalindustries will finance their/requirements in 1976-77 and 1977-78.^7-   The focus is thus on the demand which the industries make on government funds, and this is what is included in the public expenditure totals.    This demand is determined by three main factors: the investment programmes themselves; how much of thoseprogrammes the industries can finance internally from depreciationprovisions and profits; and how much of their requirement for external finance will be met from non-government sources.    Suchflows are subject to many uncertainties since they depend onassumptions about markets, pricing policies, the probability ofshortfall on investment and the pattern of foreign borrowing.The net government lending line will therefore be aggregated and financing figures on an industry by industry basis will not begiven beyond the coming financial year.18.  As in previous White Papers, the capital expenditure of public corporations, other than the nationalised industries, is included as expenditure by public corporations, and any subsidies towards
their operating costs are included under central governmentOtherexpenditure. /government grants and loans to these bodies are notindustries,included as such.   There are, apart from the nationalised/ a largenumber of bodies within the broad description of public corporation5Enterprisebut the major ones are the water authorities, the National/ Boardand new town corporations. A review is being conducted of whether the new presentation which has been adopted for the nationalised industries might appropriately be extended to any ot^&apos;etpublic corporations in future White Papers.Control and monitoring19-   Expenditure plans are costed initially at constant &quot;survey&quot;prices, and must be translated into cash provision for the yearimmediately ahead.    Wherever possible, control figures for the ye0rahead are now expressed as cash limits, which set a maximum on theextent to which the Government are prepared to adjust the original-planning figures for pay and price increases.20.    Cash limits were applied to over 65 per cent of centralgovernment voted expenditure in 1976-77, including the rate suppgrants and supplementary grants paid towards the current expendi1^of local authorities.    The main services not covered by cash lim1are those which are demand-determined, that is, services where theGovernment is obliged to meet claims from duly qualified applicafl21.

Only minorcannot rely, as they have in the past, on supplementary provis:
exceptions are being made to this rule, and then only after firstaPPlying every possible means of absorbing extra expenditure.22-    Cash limits will be applied to a similar range of expenditurein 1977-78; they will be published separately around thebeginning of the financial year.23.   Significant improvements are being made to the flow ofinformation about central government expenditure.S o   f a r   as   voted expenditure is concerned each department has always had its own internal information system:such information is now being prepared by all Departments instandard form and provided in that form to the Treasury.    In thePast the Treasury had daily figures of total issues to Votes forspending, but received a detailed breakdown from Departments oftheir expenditure only once a quarter, several weeks after the endquarter.of the/ Since September 1975 monthly returns have been made to theTreasury in the same degree and detail and within only ten workingo^ays after the end of each month.    For voted expenditure subject tocash limits actual payments are being compared with profiles ofexpected expenditure prepared at the beginning of the year.24.    11 is planned to develop and extend this information systemfurther in 1977-78.   Profiles will be developed at the beginningof the year for the path of all items of voted (and some other)to which cash limits applyexpenditure and not only for  the blocks/^ and the monthly returnsWlH become more detained so that this expenditure can be more readily compared against the various control systems of Estimates,cash limits and survey programmes.    As the expenditure plans setout in White Papers are in constant prices, the monitoring systemWlH include, where appropriate, an analysis five times a year
dividing expenditure between pay and price changes and expenditurein survey prices, so that the latter can be compared with thefigures in the plan.25-.   So far as government provision of finance to the nationalised industries is concerned, the arrangements used tomonitor their cash limits in 1976-77 will continue.   Each majornationalised industry sends to its sponsoring Department and tothe Treasury every month an up to date statement of its prospectivefinancing requirements for the year and the outturn so far (theother nationalised industries make returns every quarter)    and any significant changes in their forecasts are discussed with Departed^&apos;Local authorities26.   Local authorities have an important part to play in carryingout the strategy for public expenditure as a whole because theyare responsible for more than a quarter of public expenditure.This represents over 50% of public expenditure/on the main environmental and social service programmes such asroads and transport, housing and other environmental services,law, order and protective services, education and libraries, and personal social services.    The bulk of this expenditurecomprises the costs of more than 2 million staff* now employed bylocal authorities.    Over most of the post-war period, local author1&apos;expenditure has increased faster than public expenditure programme5as a whole, partly in response to demographic trends.    During thepast two years, however, it has declined slightly both in absolute terms and as a proportion of public spending, with a reduction in capital expenditure more than offsetting a continued rise in cur?eexpenditure.    The plans in this White Paper envisage a furthersmall reduction as a proportion of public spending in 1977-78. Thefigures are set out in table 3 and in more detail in tables 6 and7 on pages 28 and 29-*Full-time equivalents

The Government do not have the direct control over localauthority expenditure that they exercise over their own spending.Nevertheless it is generally accepted that, because of theGovernment&apos;s overall responsibility for economic management, theymust be closely concerned with the aggregate of local authority expenditure.    The continuing problem is to reconcile this needfor control in aggregate with a degree of local autonomy.28.   The Government have formal powers to approve borrowing byLocal authorities   which provide an effective means of regulate ingthe Governmentcapital expenditure* within narrow limits; and/are prepared tomake full use of them, as has been demonstrated by the reintro-duction in July 1976 of limits on new house-building, and b;y the4sharp reductions that have been made in planned captial expenditure for most local authority services.   Wherever practicable the controlfigures    - for the year ahead are expressed as cash limits.29.

expenditure (both capital and current) depends essentially oncooperation which they receive from local government.30.   The financial arrangements between central and local 6oVare at present under review in the light of the Layfield Co^Report.    But there can be no doubt that continued cooperationessential, and that this should include joint study of expe^1provision for future years.   The effectiveness of such cooped,and of the Consultative Council on Local Government finance of meetings with AEngland and Wales and/the Convention of Scottish Local Autfco^if!in fostering it, has   been severely tested over the past twoWhile total expenditure has not been restricted quite as seas the Government would have liked, the results have been i^&apos;aim31.   The rate of growth in current expenditure - which aver^per cent a year for the three years 1972-73 to 1974-75, and reached a peak of     nearly 10     per cent in 1974-75, wasn&apos;t to     4f     per cent in 1975-76 and is estimated to have beeflreduced to 2% per cent in 1976-77-32. Although in very general terms the rate support grant negotiations relate to local authority current expenditurepresented in public expenditure White Papers, governmentsubject to Parliamentary approval, how much of this expenditureshall he paid out of central taxation to local authorities,in the form of rate support grants and other grants. Most of t;;grants are now subject to cash limits.    In this way, and tWoiiguidance issued to local authorities, the Government influentlevel of current spending.

The provisionfor some services in some areas will have to be reduced; and it isestimated that staff numbers (in GB) will fall by about 25-35,000.A sharper reduction would have been required but for a switch ofabout  130 million from previously planned capital to current* The aggregate Exchequer grants which are determined in the negotiations-ations as a percentage of &quot;relevant&quot; expenditure consist of the rate support grants, specific grants (towards the police and some other services) and supplementary grants (towards roads and transport and national parks).** Relevant expenditure includes the payments for loan charges onoutstanding debt and capital expenditure met from revenue.

The rate support grant settlements for 1977-78 weremade with these considerations in mind.35-    It is not possible to comment in detail on the prospects for current expenditure or for the level of government grant in 1978-79-    On present plans, some small reduction will berequired in total current expenditure in volume terms.    the implications of containing expenditure within these limits willbe discussed further with local authorities in the coming monthsthrough the Consultative Councils and meetings with theConvention.
Contingency Reserve36.    The annual public expenditure White Papers include a contingency reserve, as provision for additions to the programme set out in the White Paper.    This contingency reserve has nowbeen developed into a more operational instrument, as one ofthe means of securing that actual expenditure is kept within the^ite Paper plan.37.   For the/yearCImmediately ahead, the size of the contingency reserve is decided in conjunction with the figures for theexpenditure programmes which are to appear in the White Paper,thus forms part of the planned total of expenditure for thecoming year.    From then on the object   is, so far as possible,to limit claims on the contingency reserve by meeting the costQf new measures, or estimated additions to the cost of existingmeasures, within existing programme totals.    The problem of^creased cost estimates for existing measures is more liableto arise where the service in question cannot be made subjecta cash limit in advance, or because of other limitations onthe Governments ability directly to control disbursementswithin pre-determined limits.    At the same time improvements are constantly being sought in the monitoring of this, as of other expenditure, and estimates are made from time to time ofProspective variations from the planned level.    Such variations^ be in either direction, and any overruns may be balanced by^uced estimates for the cost of other services, as seems likelyto be the case in 1976-77-   Where provision for new measuresCannot be met within existing programmes, or increased cost
estimates cannot be corrected or offset within programme totals,a claim on the contingency reserve has to be considered.38.    Social security is the largest central government programme which, bcv its nature, does not lend itself to the determination of rigid cash limits in advance.    A specific estimating marginto allow for this has therefore been included in this programme, and hence inthe planned total  for public expenditure;but the validity of this estimate will depend, among other things,on the subsequent course of the economy.on programmes3&apos;9&apos;    Provisional decisions/are taken, as has been explained, forthe second year ahead, that is - so far as this White Paper isconcerned - for 1978-79, and a similar decision is taken for the contingency reserve within the planned expenditure total for thatyear.    Following these decisions, any new measures or revised estimates which affect the second year ahead   are set againstthe contingency reserve for that year.    The level of the contingency reserve is reviewed along with the spending programmes in each successive survey, having regard to the claims already made on the reserve shown in the previous White Paper, and tothe Government1s decisions on the appropriate overall level ofpublic expenditure.Debt Interest40.    In addition to the planned total of public expenditure,represented by the various functional programmes and the contingency reserve,a separate projection is made for the
estimated cost of debt interest which has to be met either outof taxation or by fresh borrowing.Previous White Papers have presented the total of debt interest which is paid by the public sector, as shown in thenational, accounts.    But the creator part of this does not haveto be financed from taxes or further borrowing.    The communityraeets a large part through the prices, rents or charges whichit pays for goods and services provided by the public sector,and some is met by interest receipts.    Some interest payments,on the other hand, have to be made on borrowings which wereto financeapplied either to finance current deficits or/investment indirectlsuch things as roads, schools and hospitals, which do not/generalsignificant amounts of income to service the debt.    In the newintroducedPresentation/in this White Paper,debt interest figures are snownwhich exclude those interest payments which fall in the formercategory and are covered by trading income or interest receipts.To the extent that trading income is subsidised by the Governmentthe subsidies are shown in the appropriate functional, programmes4-2      . theFigures on both the old and/new basis are shown in tables6on page 28. The estimate for this year, 1976-77,ls  1,800 million on the new basis and about  6,500 million onthe old basis.    Of the difference of  4,700 million,nearly halfisaccounted for by provision for interest by nationalised&quot;&quot;&quot;^Ustries and other public corporations, over a third byi n-t,erest payments from local authority housing accounts,and most

CONFIDENTIALPUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND THE ECONOMY43,    Last year&apos;s white Paper drew attention to the pressures arising^om popular expectations for improved public services, welfareProgrammes and personal consumption.    These pressures hove not been confined to the United Kingdom;    they have manifested themselves in*ost other countries.    However, in the case of the United Kingdomthe satisfaction of these pressures has been rendered particularly difficult by the relatively poor performance of the economy.Over at least the past fifteen years the United Kingdom&apos;s rate of growth of productivity has been barely two-thirds of the average for&quot;*Jor OECD countries.    The slow rate of growth of real resourceshas sharpened the conflict between the claims of private and publicEnding.    It has contributed to each of the three acute oroblemsnow facing us:    the large deficit in the balance of payments: thehiKh rate of inflation: and the high level of unemployment,delated with these problems is a lar^e public sector borrowing^Uirement, which poses considerable problems for monetary^nagement and industrial financing.Nevertheless,up to 1973 it was possible to take some comfort inthe fact that the nation&apos;s real income was rising, although at separately by international standards.    This made possible aCo^iderable and sustained improvement in the provision of publicSei,viCes along with a growth of personal consumption;    but^oughout this period manufacturing investment was sluggish and ourShs*e of world trade continued to decline.     The dramatic increases inV&apos;0*ld commodity prices and the quadrupling of the oil price in 1973,h0^ver, caused a sharp deterioration in Britain&apos;s terms of trade that to a fall of 5% in the nation&apos;s real disposable income betweenl9?3 and 1974 - the eouivalent of almost two normal years&apos; growth of
NRDENTIAL45.   The worsening of the terms of trade also plunged the balance ofpayments deeper Into deficit.Between the end of 1972, when thecurrent account was last in surplus, and the end of 1976, the cumulatedeficit on current account was more than  7 2 billion.    Though there ha(^been a marked reduction in the deficit in 1975, there was no further improvement in 1976, when the deficit of /nearly  2 billion-7 amountedto /almost \i%7 of national income.47-   In the wake of the oil price increase the Government sought tocushion the impact on living standards and employment; but theproblems of doing so were intensified as the world slid into severerecession and the public sector borrowing rose steeply.    Over thethree years to 1975.-76, when output rose by /less than 3%J7, thevolume of public expenditure rose by /&quot;&quot;J per cent;  in that year the ratio of public expenditure to gross domestic nroduct (at market prices) was /46 per centw7, compared with^around    35 per cent -7ten years earlier, and the PSBR was equivalent to /almost 10-7 percent of GDP.**48.   The sharp check to the recovery in world trade in 1976 disappoinearlier hopes that a sustained expansion of UK exports would furtherreduce the external deficit and generate increased output andemployment at home that,  in time, would bring down the public sectordeficit.    The problems of financing these deficits became acute andwere reflected in the weakness of the exchange rate and in the sharpincreases in UK interest rates that were necessary both to assiststerling and to check the rapid growth of money and credit.isOj    It was against this general background that the Chancellor of ^eExchequer announced on 15 December   . a stabilisation programme,extending over two years or more,to restore confidence, to bring the&apos;*wifhd8D^nmeasureSDa^ fac^or^ost the ratio of public expenditure was/51.5 per cent   7 in 1975-76 and / 40 per cent-7 ten years earlier; andthe PSBR in 1975/76 was equivalent to /&apos;;1 J per cent of GDP.
CONFIDEr-WALeconomy back into balance and to reduce the strains that the financing of the public sector was imposing in financial markets.50.    In his Statement the Chancellor announced the Government&apos;saim to hold the PSBR to  8.7 billion in 1977-78, and to  8.6billion in 1978-79.    The latter level was estimated to renuire afurther fiscal adjustment of  ^ billion in 1978-79 at 1976 prices,in addition to the measures announced, but it was too soon to say what form this further adjustment would take.    These objectives forthe PSBR were determined on the basis of a forecast that the GDPwould increase by about 2% in 1977-78, and by 2-^-3% in thefollowing year.    In carrying out the 1977 expenditure survey and the subsequent Budget, the Government would continue to be guided by theneed to shift resources into exports and investment;    and if the forecast growth of the economy from the beginning of 1978 to theend of 1979 exceeds 3ir% a year, an additional fiscal adjustmentwould be made in the 1978 Budget of  -J-l billion at 1976 prices - the exact amount depending on the buoyancy of demand and the state of theworld economy at the time.totals51.     The expenditure/-.^et out in this White Pape^ do not take account of such further adjustments, the form of which has not yetbeen decided.    Subject to this,the ratio of public expenditure to GDP at market prices would fall from some /46-per cent in 1975-76 to ^2-43 .J7 Per cent in 1978-79.    this represents a significant reversal of the trend of public expenditure to rise as a oroportion of GDP.52*   The ratio of total public expenditure (including transfer payments and lending) to GDP is not a wholly reliable indicator ofthe importance of the public sector in the economy as a whole.* At factor cost the decline would be from /3l-^7 Per cent to / 48-per cent.
CONFIDENTIALTransfers and loans to the private sector renuire Governmenttaxation or borrowing, but finance private, not public, consumption and investment.    Moreover, the total is affected by any changes inthe extent to which the nationalised industries rely on theGovernment to meet their external financing needs.    Another ratio.,directwhich may also be. useful in some contexts, is that of/expenditure 01goods and services by central Government and local authorities.This was equivalent to some /&quot;&quot;27-7 per cent of GDP (at market prices) in 1975-76, an increase of /&quot;&quot;4J7 percentage noints since1971-72.    On the expenditure plans in this White Paper this proportion is expected to fall to Z^+JZ   per cent in 1978-79 &apos;about /&quot;the same leve^y as in 1971-72.53.   The next two or three years must be essentially a period of adjustment in the economy in which we get the balance of payments as well as carrying through, the fight against inflation,right,/ By holding to the public expenditure plans, and withcontinuing restraint in incomes and an increasing flow of oil fvo&amp;the North Sea,it should be possible to move into substantial balaflcof payments surplus in 1978, and. to achieve a further improvementin 1979.    By 1980 the current account surplus should be approach!^the high level that will be needed for several years thereafter i11order to discharge our debts and strengthen our external financesand so make us less vulnerable to external shocks in the future.Even with the help of North Sea oil the achievement of this improvement in the balance of payments will entail a very tighton the growth of domestic demand, both private and public.* At factor cost, the decline would be fromin 1975/76 to /2lJ per cent in 1978/79.24per cent
CONFIDENTIAL5k.   To create the conditions in which a sustained increase inemployment will he possible, our endeavours during the coming yearsmust be concentrated on improving our industrial performance andespecially in securing a more rapid increase in net exports.Our own prospects here are inevitably strongly influenced bydevelopments in the world economy, as events in the past year haveshown.     The evolution of the economy through the next few years will depend, however, not only on the actions of governments.      It will depend crucially on the response of British industry, both managementtrade unions, to the changed environment - and,  in particular,how effectively industry seizes the opportunities for expansion created*y the marked improvement in its international competitiveness.     This^ the central objective of the tripartite industrial strategy.55.   No attempt is made in this White Paper to set out detailedeconomic projections over the survey period.     The prospects forthe next few years and beyond will depend critically both on the trend m the world economy and on the progress of our -own efforts indrying through the adjustments to which we are now committed.The Chancellor will give a further appraisal of the prospects in his budget statement.56-   North Sea oil gives us the prospect, provided that we manage ouraffairs prudently,  of a substantial surplus in the balance of payments.U will not by itself provide significant additional employment,  or inUs*lf constitute a large continuing annual growth of resources;    but,by easing the balance of payments constraints which have for so longaci(ied to the difficulty of managing the British economy,  it will give us the opportunity to secure the major strengthening of the industrial*ase, and through this a renewed growth in employment.     Theievement of this goal requires precedence to he given to restoringth*achle balance of payments and re-establishing a sound industrial base
CONFIDENTIALin growth industries in apportioning the benefits which can arise from the full development of North Sea oil.57.    A modern civilised society needs an adequate level of public services.      They are prerequisites of efficiency, as well aswelfare and personal freedom.      However, at this juncture furthersocial improvements must depend on the prior achievement of our economic and industrial objectives.
