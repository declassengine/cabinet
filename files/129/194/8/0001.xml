DoCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT0CP(7V) 8 COPY NO    U17 January 1977CABINETINDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for TradeINTRODUCTIONThe Bullock Committee (terms of reference and membership at annex A) reported to me shortly before Christmas, and publication is planned for the week beginning 24 January.    The issues covered have very^-reaching consequences, both economic and social, and their handlingrequire corresponding care in relation to our response at the time of publication and how the report should be followed up, and the timetable.RECOMMENDATIONSThere are separate majority and minority reports.    The majority report is signed by Lord Bullock, the three trade union members**** Jack Jones, Mr Clive Jenkins and Mr David Lea), the other twoacademics (Professors Bain and Wedderburn), and, though with substantial^observations on the issue of the proportion of employees on the board, byWe solicitor (Mr Wil son).    Its broad lines are as follows -a. There should be a statutory right for the employees to berepresented at board level in companies with over 2, 000 employees.b. This right could be exercised at the initiative of recognisedtrade unions, subject to confirmation by a ballot of all the employees.c. If the right were exercised, the board would consist of threeparts:  equal numbers of worker and shareholder representatives and a small, uneven number of &quot;independents&quot;, co-opted byagreement between the worker and shareholder representatives.d. Worker representation should be on the main board of thecompany which, as at present, would have overall responsibility forthe company1 s affairs (ie there should continue to be a &quot;unitary&quot;board, not a two-tier system of separate supervisory and management
boards with separate functions and responsibilities defined by law).While the board would be able to delegate work to sub-committee as a matter of convenience, it could not delegate ultimate responsibility.e. Worker representatives should be selected through tradeunion machinery from among employees of the firm.f. Worker representatives should have the same responsibilities and duties as other directors.    All directors should have the duty to run the company with regard to the interests of shareholdersand workers.g. Implementation of the arrangements should take place within 1-2 years of the request by a recognised trade union.MINORITY REPORT3* The minority report is signed by the two industrialists (Sir JackCallard and Mr Heath) and the banker (Mr Biggs).    They criticise theterms of reference given to the Committee as having prejudged theimportant issue of principle.    They do not necessarily accept a statutoryright to worker representation although they accept that the law should be revised to make this possible where voluntarily agreed;  they also argue that worker representation (statutory or voluntary) should be on asupervisory board in a two-tier system, with a smaller representationthan the shareholders.    They emphasise the need for agreement between management and unions on participation below board level and expressreservations on the worker directors being nominated by the unions alone.THE POSITIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE TRADES UNION CONGRESS(TUC), AND THE CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY (CBI)*        The Government is committed to the principle of industrialemocracy by means of representation of workers on the boards of companies and to the essential role of trade unions in this.    It is not,owever, as a Government committed to parity of representation.    ThePrinciple- of parity is accepted in the latest version of the social contract^hich says &quot;We welcome the Government1 s stated intention to introducemdustrial democracy legislation in the 1976-77 session;  this should provideorganised workers in large companies with the right to parity of ^,resentation on the main policy boards of their companies&quot; (paragraph 27t  . &quot;^he Next Three Years&quot;).    The Queen&apos;s Speech contained an undertakingth lntro^uce &quot;legislative proposals&quot; as soon as possible after publication ofe Bullock Report and completion of the necessary consultations.2
5. The TUC are likely to press for rapid implementation of the majorityrecommendations and to argue that consultation should be restricted topoints of detailed implementation.    The CBI policy recently reaffirmed inThe Road to Recovery&quot; (Chapter IX) is one of opposition to any statutorilyimposed system of worker directors, even as a minority.    They argue thatan imposed system could not achieve the harmony necessary for a board towork effectively, and that &quot;participation should begin at the grass roots,at the shop floor, .... some agreed form of top level machinery is onlylikely to work if suitable &quot;infrastructure&quot; has been established and isQperating successfully.11    Their own policy favours compulsoryParticipation agreements&quot;.IMPLICATIONS OF THE BULLOCK REPORTThe recommendations of the Bullock Committee are very different from the arrangements anywhere else in Western Europe including the newWest German arrangements introduced last year except in the iron and steel industries where parity already existed.    The difference in the BullockProposals arises from the following elements in particular:a. Parity of representation for workers and shareholderstogether with a small uneven number of &quot;independents&quot; co-optedby agreement between the worker and shareholder representatives(the so-called 2x 4- y formula).b. The worker representatives would sit on the main board andnot on a supervisory board as in most other European systems.c. Worker representatives would be selected through tradeunion machinery - a point of fundamental importance to the TUC.d. The move to parity of representation by shareholder andworker directors would be at a single step - other countries havenot so far adopted complete parity, with the representation of employees on the board following the development of participatoryarrangements below.7&apos;        The Bullock recommendations represent a major reform in the wholesis of control of industry with far-reaching implications for industrialRations and investment.    It is clear that the publication of the Bullockeport will need very careful handling, particularly in order to avoid ass of industrial and economic confidence abroad.    The reaction to this^sue will be largely determined by the atmosphere in which it is implemented.TttS c*ear*y essential that there should be an opportunity for the CBI and the.   c to try to reach at least some degree of consensus and it will be of greatth ^Q&apos;tance that the eventual decisions of the Government should commande &quot;widest possible degree of support.3
8. The Economic Strategy Committee has concluded that I should makea statement upon publication of the Report which would welcome the Report;reaffirm the Government&quot;s commitment to the principle of industrial democracy including worker representation on boards;  encourage earlydebate and consultation against the background of the need to prepare a Billthie session;  and indicate how the Government would undertakeconsultations while avoiding any commitment on the details of the proposals.I was invited to prepare such a statement in consultation with the secretaries of State for Employment and for Industry.    A draft will be considered by the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy on 18 January and will be circulated to Cabinet thereafter.NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR9- The statement will also refer to the nationalised industries and itshould probably include a sentence on the public services to forestall thequestions which would otherwise arise.    In these areas it will be necessaryto make clear that there are different considerations arising out of ministerial responsibility to Parliament and the constraints imposed onthe scope for industrial democracy by the elective principle.    This aspectis to be discussed further by the Economic Strategy Committee on18 January.E d department of Trade17 January 19774
ANNEX ATerras of Reference -Accepting the need for a radical extension of industrial democracyin the control of companies by means of representation on boards of directors, and accepting the essential role of trade union organi-sations in this process, to consider how such an extension can best be achieved, taking into account in particular the proposals of theTrades Union Congress report on industrial democracy as well as experience in Britain, the e.c. and other countries.   Having regardto the interest of the national economy, employees, investors and consumers, to analyse the implications of such representation forthe efficient management of companies and for company law.Composition -Lord BullockProfessor George BainMr N P BiggsSir Jack CallardMr Barrie HeathMr Clive JenkinsMr Jack jones mr David LeaProfessor K WWedderbumMaster of St Catherines College, Oxford.Director of the Industrial RelationsResearch Unit for the University ofWarwick.Chairman of Williams and Glyn*s Bank Ltd.Former Chairman of ICI.Chairman of Guest, Keen and Netilefolds Ltd.General Secretary of the Association of scientific, Technical and ManagerialStaffs.General Secetary of the Transport andGeneral Workers Union.Secretary, Economic Department, TradesUnion Congress.Cassel Professor of Commercial Law in theUniversity of London (London School of economics).Mr N S WilsonSolicitor.
ANNEX draft STATEMENT BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADEith permission I should like to make a statement on industrial^mocracy.    The departmental Committee of Inquiry, which wasflounced by my predecessor on 5 August 1975 and which came intoeing during December of that year under the chairmanship ofJLT^ bullock, submitted its Report to me on 14 December.    I am. ranging for it to be published today and copies have been placedin the Library and the Vote Office..r e RePort of the Committee is not unanimous.   There is a majorityw? r&quot;k s^Sne^ by the Chairman and 6 members of the Committee, butth    a^ imPortant note of dissent by one of the 6.    In addition1 ere is a minority report signed by the remaining 3 members.j Vertheless I welcome the work that the Committee as a whole hasfQne and I pay tribute in particular to its Chairman, Lord Bullock,mo      e vas&quot;t amount that has been accomplished in the course of 12th ^e Committee has greatly advanced the consideration oflls complex subject by analysing the issues and clarifying thevoices.Tht.e Majority of the Committee recommend the introduction of legisla-CQ0ri &quot;to give employees a right to representation on the boards of, mPanies employing 2000 or more.   This right would be triggeredbali^ aPPlication from a recognised trade union, confirmed by a6    ^ of all employees.    The reconstituted board would consist ofco--&quot;&quot; nurflbers of employee and shareholder representatives who would*0u??   a further small uneven number of directors.    All directorsId have the same duties and responsibilities.bel minority report favours the prior development of participatingbe !?w k0ard level and proposes that if employee representation is tosVst     Qduced it should be on a supervisory board in a two-tierSel -^le employee representatives would not necessarily beected through trade union machinery.oQ   ^nority report also criticises the terms of reference of theon &apos;11:^ee which presupposed a commitment to employee representationmenf0m^any boards.    I should therefore make it clear that the Govern-cq^   is committed, as we were when we set up the Committee, to a radi-f0l, extension of industrial democracy by representation of the work-1^ ^.0n company boards and to the essential role of trade unionsBuxi       Process.    This is the basis on which the majority of thelatj.0^ Committee have proceeded.   We intend to bring forward legis-ass^v?
