DoCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 22 COPY NO22 February 1977CABINETAIRCRAFT AND SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRIES bill memorandum by the Lord President of the council I. Following the discussion in Cabinet on 17 February(CM(77) 6th Conclusions, Minute 1, Conclusion 2) a group of Ministers has met under my chairmanship to consider the implications of the ruling bythe House of Lords Examiners that the Aircraft and Shipbuilding IndustriesBill is hybrid in respect of the chip repairing companies scheduled fornationalisation (a copy of the ruling is at Annex A).2. The Standing Orders Committee of the House of Lords meets on23 February to decide whether to dispense with the Standing Orders on prioradvertisement of introduction of a private Bill etc which would normallyapply to a hybrid Bill.    If the Committee should decide that these standing orders should not be dispensed with the House of Lords would be unable toProceed to a Second Reading of the Bill and it could immediately besubmitted for Royal Assent under the Parliament Acts.    If, as is more likely, the Committee decide that this Standing Order about prior noticeshould be dispensed with the Bill will go to Second Reading and if passedwould in the normal way go to a Select Committee where objectors to its passage could present their case.    There is little prospect of getting the lords to pass a Motion dispensing with the Select Committee procedurewithout some Government concessions and an attempt to do so could resultin a humiliating defeat.    The effective choice for the Government is between:-a. Allowing the Bill to proceed through the Select Committeeprocedure and passing it under the Parliament Acts when itemerges, which probably means at the end of the Session.b. Seeking a deal under which the Government would agree to drop from the Bill the ship repairing companies (but not the shiprepairing interests of the shipbuilding companies) in return for a clear commitment from the Opposition in both Houses that they would allow the remainder of the Bill to proceed immediately to royal assent without further delay or amendment.1
Course b. would, if all goes smoothly and the Lords speed up their usualprocedures, probably result in Royal Assent by Easter or soon after,saving about six months compared with course a.3. The main factors affecting this choice are:-a. Industrial consequences of delay.    The Secretary of Statefor Industry&apos;s assessment is at Annex B.    The main risks of delayarise in the aircraft industry where the absence of a single bodyable to speak with authority on behalf of both the British aircraft corporation and Hawker Siddeley could prejudice the conclusion ofcollaborative arrangements with overseas companies particularlyBoeing.    However, there is no certainty that negotiations on thecollaborative projects will come to a head in the next six months.Delay would cause some long-term damage to the shipbuilding industry but the policy decisions which Cabinet took on 17 February(CM(77) 6th Conclusions, Minute 3) and the establishment of the newholding company for the Government shareholdings in the industry should avoid serious and immediate damage.    Delay couldprecipitate the closure of some ship repairers;  but so could theirexclusion from the Bill.b. Implications of the Hybridity Ruling.    The Examiners have gone well beyond their task of saying whether the Standing Ordersapplicable to private Bills should apply to the Aircraft and shipbuilding Industries Bill.    Certain aspects of their ruling -notably their view that to define which companies are to be nationalisedby reference to their total turnover, including turnover outside shiprepairing, in itself causes hybridity - could have seriousimplications for future legislation (particularly nationalisation Bills).The Examiners&apos; ruling is on the record;  but if we decide to seek adeal it should be possible to present our decision as recognising thatthe Examiners&apos; ruling is decisive in this case without necessarilyaccepting the arguments on which that ruling is based.c. Parliament Act.    Annex C describes the position under the parliament Acts.    The main question is whether, if we decide toproceed under those Acts, we could, should we have lost ourCommons majority before the end of the Session, submit the Bill forRoyal Assent without further votes in the Commons.    There is norequirement under the Parliament Acts for the Commons to consider any amendments which the House of Lords now make to the Bill andit could be submitted for Royal Assent at the end of the Sessionwithout such consideration.    It is possible for the Commons to direct that the Parliament Acts should not be invoked but there is no obligation on the Government to provide time for such a Motion andthe officials of the House of Commons have advised informally thatsuch a Motion would not be in order on a Supply day.    However the2
possibility of further votes in the Commons cannot be entirelyexcluded;  and it could be politically embarrassing to submit theBill for Royal Assent without the Commons having voted on anyLords1 amendments.    (It would always be open to the Oppositionto table a Motion of censure;  but defeat of the Government on thatwould have implications going beyond the Aircraft and shipbuilding industries Bill).d. Political factors.    Many members of the parliamentary labour Party and of the Labour Party in the country are likely toreact strongly against a decision to drop the ship repairingcompanies from the Bill.    They would see it as a surrender to theHouse of Lords and to Bailey&apos;s campaign.    The Confederation shipbuilding and Engineering Unions have told the Prime minister that they would reluctantly acquiesce in the dropping of the shiprepairing companies if the Government decided that was necessaryto secure a speedy passage for the rest of the Bill.    To continueunder the Parliament Act and then lose the Bill at the end of the session would of course be a still more damaging political defeat.conclusions. The majority of the Group very reluctantly took the view that theindustrial consequences of delay and the political risks of proceeding underthe Parliament Acts made it necessary to try and do a deal with theOpposition on the lines suggested in paragraph 2b.    There was no certainty that the Opposition would be ready for such a deal - the decision would betaken by the Shadow Cabinet as a whole.    An important minority of theGroup, however, had reservations about this course.5. Cabinet are asked to decide whether to authorise an explorationof the possibilities of a deal with the Opposition under which the shiprepairing companies would be deleted from the Aircraft and shipbuilding industries Bill in return for clear commitments from the Opposition in bothHouses to allow the remainder of the Bill to pass quickly.    If Cabinet decide in favour of such explorations the tactics of the approach to the Oppositionwill need to be carefully considered by the managers of government business in both Houses in consultation with the Secretary of State for industry.M FPrivy Council Office22 February 19773
AIRCRAFT AND SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRIES 3ILLWe have based our inquiry on the well-known statement by Mr. Speaker Hylton-Foster on the Bill for the London government act 1963:&quot;I think that a hybrid Bill can be defined asa Public    Bill which affects a particularprivate interest in a manner different fromthe private intex-est of other persons orbodies of the same category or class.&quot;This definition,  taken at its face value, indicates what mighthave been thought to be obvious, that the doctrine of hybridityIs an expression of the will of each House of Parliament that an individual singled out by a Public Bill for adverse treatmentshould be allowed to plead his cause to a Select Committee on a petition against the Bill or against those provisions of theSill that will affect him.    The doctrine was designed to give theininority some defence against the legislature;    and that in moderntimes means defence against the Crown.    Unless it &quot;is that, itis nothing.Yet this defence has been eroded by two Speakers&apos;flings, the first given before, and the second given after,Mr. * Speaker Hylton-Foster&apos;s Ruling.    Before discussing theseKlines, icis right to call attention to the difficulty of applying the Hylton-Foster definition to any particular Bill, very person or body is a member of a category or class ofPersons or bodies and every category or class of persons orbodies Is a member of a wider category or class of persons or-bc-dies.    Therefore,  the answer to the question whether a Billls hybrid on the Hylton-Foster definition depends on where you-erayc-Ur category or class.    The two Rulings we have referred toa&quot;ce that of Mr.  Speaker Clifton-Brown on the Bill for the Iron
and Steel Act 1949 and that of Mr. Speaker King on the Bill forthe Iron and Steel Act 1967.    The effect of both of them is thatthe category or class that is relevant is the one selected bythe Promoters of the Bill.    In other words,  the defences of thesubject against selective ill-treatment can be turned by drawing a category-or class that comprises him and his fellowvictims and nobody else.We therefore conceive ourselves effectively prohibitedby the Rulings of Mr.  Speaker Clifton-Brown and Mr. Speaker Kingfrom finding that the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries BiHis inherently hybrid,  that is to say that we cannot in the lighcof those Rulings find that the class of companies whose-securities are to be taken into public ownership is describedwith such particularity that it is itself a selection from a wider class of companies.    We are prohibited, not because we asOfficers of the House of Lords are formally bound by decisionsof the Speakers of the House of Commons, but because it would be*to say the least, inconvenient if the two Houses developeddifferent doctrines of hybridity.It is still open to us to find that this Bill ishybrid according as we answer the arid questions whether all thecompanies named in Part I of the Second Schedule to the Bill are within the category or class set out in Part II of that Scheduleand whether any company within that category or class is notnamed in Part I.    If Part I and Part II of the Second Schedule&apos;are not congruent, the Bill is hybrid.    This is becauset -(a) . if a company is named in Part I but is outsidethe category or class defined in Part II, it is single^out-from its own category or class;   and(b) if a company within the category or class define&quot;In Part II is nevertheless not named in Part I,  thecompanies named in Part I are within a category or classnot all of whose members are subjected to national!zati011,CONFIDENTIAL
We deal later with the Government&apos;s suggestion that a categoryor class other than that described in Part II is appropriate to the list in Part I.It is widely supposed that the Bill is to nationalizethe aircraft manufacturing industrial-y and the shipbuilding industry.This is far from the truth.    The long title of the Bill refers to &quot;certain companies&quot; engaged in those industries, and,  so faras the shiprepairing industry is concerned, and that is theindustry that our examination has been almost exclusivelyconcerned with,  the Bill is notably selective.    Out of the ninetyor so shiprepairing companies, the Bill would bring into public ownership twelve companies named in the Second Schedule asshiprepairing companies, and about six more shiprepairing companies which are on the list in that Schedule of shipbuilding companies and presumably fulfil the criteria appropriate to such companies.if  therefore, we were free to apply Mr. Speaker Hylton-Foster&apos; sruling to the shiprepairing nationalization proposed by the Bill,but without taking Mr. Speaker King&apos;s Ruling into account, weshould be forced to find it hybrid, whether we were to treat the&quot;category or class&quot; as comprising the. &quot;companies engaged in shipbuilding and allied industries&quot; mentioned in the long titleOr as comprising those engaged in the shiprepairing industry.It was only by devising a class as tight as that described inParagraphs 1 and 3 of Part II of the Second Schedule to the bill that the Government could hope to avoid hybridity.    How tightthat class is can be seen by a study of those paragraphs andof the definitions of &quot;group of companies&quot; and &quot;subsidiary&quot; in clause 56(1).One of the main arguments advanced by those whoappeared before us in support of the proposition that the Billis hybrid (whom we shall refer to as&quot;the Memorialists&quot;) was that many shipowning companies fitted the description in paragraph.i(b) of Part II of the Schedule as companies that &quot;fulfilled&apos;the criteria&quot; in paragraph 3 of that Part as shiprepairingcompanies, in that the^OEMBDSNJJAiinong other criteria, that
of being engaged on the 31st July, 1974, in the business ofrepairing, refitting or maintaining ships in spite of the factthat the ships were their own     The Government has all alongresisted this contention-    In his answer of 14th October 1976,to a question asked by Lord Colville of Culross, Lord Peartsaid:&quot;The Government are satisfied that a person whodoes repair or other work only for himself, suchas a shipowner carrying out his own repairs ormaintaining his own ships, is not &apos;engaged inthe business of repairing,  refitting or maintainingships 1.    A good analogy would be a hotel company which launders its own linen;    no-one would say this would make the company into a companyengaged in the. laundry business.&quot;It was pointed out to us that the hotel analogy would have been better had it said &quot;would make the company into a companyengaged in the business of laundering linen.&quot;We are thus invited to find that the Bill is hybridbecause, although the shipowning companies are for the most partnot within the list of shiprepairing companies contained inPart I of the Second Schedule they fulfil the conditions inPart II of that Schedule.    This issue, above all, shows theunreality and artificiality of what we have been enquiring int0.We are aware that Mr. Speaker King, in ruling that the Bill   forthe Iron and Steel Act 1967 was not hybrid, declined to speculaon the reason why the class devised for that Bill was selecteo,but in the case before us there was no occasion to speculatebecause both Mr. Gamon, the Government Agent, and Mr. McDonaldjwhom he called as a witness from the Department of Indus try,It abundantly clear that from the beginning the Government waaiming, not at the shiprepairing industry, but at a. carefulselected list of companies engaged in that industry.     The  of Hybridity was, therefore, immediately apparent, and we aentitled to assume that Parliamentary Counsel endeavoured to draft Part II of the Second Schedule so as to enable theGovernment to avoid hybridity by availing itself of Mr. SpCcl *rr\ KicincMTi ai
King&apos;s Ruling,  that is to say, by devising a category or classinto which the twelve companies could be fitted, but no othersexcept those included in the list of shipbuilding companies.The Government was fully entitled to do this, as other Governmenthave in the past;    but the effect of such tactics if remarkable,because the right of any of the twelve companies to plead itscause before a Select Committee depends, not on any considerationof the rights of the subject, but on the success of parliamentary counsel in so drafting the Schedule that Parts I and II coverexactly the same twelve companies;    and indeed we had evidencethat Part II was altered in the draft Bill stage of the originalBill, both on the dry-dock qualification and on the turnoverqualification, to admit or exclude individual companies.Moreover, when we turn to the question whethershipowning companies are also shiprepairing companies for thepurposes of the Bill,  the answer is &quot;No&quot; because those companies are not named in Part I of the Schedule.    But that is not thequestion we have to answer.    What we have to answer is the artificial question whether shipowning companies which repairtheir own ships fulfil the criteria in paragraph 3(l)(a) ofPart II of the Schedule as shiprepairing companies.    Mr.  Gamonstrongly urged us to Have regard to the intention of those whoframed the Bill;    but this leads us nowhere&quot;.    The intention ofthose who framed the Bill was to exclude the shipowning companiesor most of them;    and this, of course, the Bill will achieve not by reference to the long title or to the language of paragraphl^b) of Part II, but by the list of companies in Part I.    we find that many of the shipowning companies did repair their ownships. ..   \ -Whether it follows from this that the shipowningcompanies which repaired their own ships were &quot;engaged in thebusiness&quot; of repairing ships is an evenly balanced question.To find that they were not so&quot;engaged involves some absurdity&quot;having regard to the case of Clyde Wharf Limited, a subsidiaryof Sugar Line Ltd., wSONWSXG^TSM end of March 1973 was
repairing ships belonging to Sugar Line.    On 31st March 1973,Clyde Wharf ceased to trade and transferred its shiprepairingsection to Sugar Line, together with the workforce,  plant and machinery used In that section.    Before the transfer ClydeWharf was certainly engaged in the business of repairing ships.Can it therefore reasonably be held that immediately aftertransfer Sugar Line was not engaged in that business&apos;becauseits main business was the owning of ships?   We, nevertheless,find that, in ordinary parlance, to be engaged in businessconnotes making, or attempting to make, a trading profit.But the element of trading profit is more evidentin the analogous case of companies such as Athel Line Ltd.,Royal Mail Lines Ltd.,  Houlder Brothers Ltd., ManchesterLiners Ltd.,and Shaw Savill &amp; Albion Ltd. which were managinSships belonging to other companies.    We were told that a management contract invariably requires the manager to maintai11the ship and generally requires him to repair the ship.    As a rule small repairs are done by the managerTs employees at sea or in port;    larger repairs are carried out: by shiprepairers.The five companies mentioned above are relevant, not because- it was suggested that they should be in the Bill, but because?in the case of Athel, its turnover would, it was submitted tous, have required Richards (Shipbuilders) Ltd., and, in thecases, their turnover would have required Manchester Dry Doc1l,cSLtd. j to be included in the Bill as shiprepairing companies,/yll five companies sometimes repaired their managed &quot;ships withtheir own workforce and equipment.    There is is thus a strong arguement for the proposition that a company that.contracts with a shipowner to manager his ships, and, as an element ot.management, to maintain them and repair them as occasiondemands with the managerrs workforce and equipment is &quot;engaSin the business of repairing, refitting or maintaining ship5Is the managing company then nevertheless engaged in the      tbusiness of managing ships or can it be said to be engagedin the business of managing and the business of repairing otmaintaining?   With some difficulty, we have come to the confidential
&quot;We have now leased from the Mersey Docks and harbour Company both No.l and No.3 Birkenhead Drydocks.You will probably know that we maintain our own vesselsutilising our workshops both at Bromborough and adjacent, to the drydocks.For many years we have virtually monopolisedNo.l dry dock for own own vessels and this utilisation,together with third party vessels using No.3 dock,leaves us with about 707o spare capacity.Since 1st May 1972 we have been hiring the dockto shiprepairers who also carry out their own repairs,but we would also like to make maximum use of ourworkshop facilities.    It is for this reason we arewriting to ask if you would allow us to quote fordrydocking and repairs on your vessels which drydockregularly in the Port of Liverpool.We would like to think that, apart from ourlarge stocks of - materials and parts  (peculiar todredgers), we have also accumulated a great dealof specialised knowledge, and hope therefore .we maybe of some assistance.&quot;The Company was from June 1972 until about May 1975, and&quot;certainly at the end of July 1974, repairing ships that werenot owned or chartered or managed by the company includingships belonging to the Preston Port Authority.    There is somedispute between the Memorialists and the Government about thenumber of ships repaired^jCjfiUtsiders during this period.conclusion that the management &quot;of ships does not involve the manager In the business of maintaining or repairing ships.It was submitted to us that the Westminster DredgingCompany,  though not listed in Part I of the Second Schedule,was engaged in the business of repairing, refitting ormaintaining ships within the meaning of paragraph 3(l)(a) ofPart II of the Schedule becaxise it was engaged in 7:epairingnot only its own ships and ships chartered by it but also ships of other companies.    On 7th June 1972,the company wrote to thegeneral manager and engineer of the Port of Preston authority in these terms :
We find that there were seven or eight.    This repair work wasa small portion of the company&apos;s total business, which consists of dredging and land reclamation.    The turnover of the company in the financial year ended 31st December 1974, was  21million, whereas the turnover of the company so far as itrelated to repair work undertaken for- outside companieswas from May 1972 to December 1975 inclusive not more than 47,305.- * It was submitted to us that the London Graving DockCompany Ltd.,  though included in Part I of the Second Scheduleto the Bill, . did not fulfil the criteria of paragraph 3 of. Part II of that Schedule.    That company in the year in which31st July 1974 fell was acting purely as a holding company,one of whose subsidiaries was London Graving Dock ShipRepairs Ltd.    Though the parent company has for most of&apos; thetime been the one selected by the Government for national!zationthere was a time in the spring of 1975 when both the Governmentand the- directors of the companies were in serious doubt whethc1to select the parent or its subsidiary.    It was the view of the directors that neither the parent nor its subsidiary in isolation appeared to fulfil the criteria specified inparagraph 3 of Part II of the Second Schedule;    buf-the Govc^ntf2had no doubt that taken together the two companies and thecompanies in the same group engaged in shiprepairing fulf i^-^&apos;0those criteria.    After prolonged negotiations between theGovernment and the directors, it was decided by the Governmentwith the approval of the directors to list the parent company in Part I;    but the involvement of the parent company in tnebusiness of repairing, refitting or maintaining ships wastenuous and depended cn a contract with Trinity House which Ventirely subcontracted to London Graving Dock Ship RepairsI&apos;td.    A note by Mr. Walker of the Department of Industry ota meeting on 10th April 1975.between the Department and the.directors suggests that there may have been other long-term contracts;    but we have no evidence about their content.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFjJ2 MI4ALThe parent company^ turnover for the relevant financial year,which is that ended 31st March 1973, was over  5 million, beingthe consolidated turnover of the company and its subsidiaries.At the&apos; end of the March 1973 the company ceased to carry outshiprepairing, but retained its fixed assets.    Though itemployed some 200 persons some of whom were engaged inshiprepairing, its turnover for the year ended 31st March1975, the year in which 31st July 1974,  fell, was nil.    Allthe practical work including administration work on the parentcompany&apos;s contracts was performed by London Graving DockRepairs.We deal next with J.B. Howie Ltd. and WesternShiprepairers Ltd.    Both these companies were on 31st July1974 engaged in the business of   repairing, refitting ormaintaining ships.    Both companies were entitled to an interestin possession in,  or a licence to occupy, a dry-dock or agi*aving dock within the meaning of the Second Schedule,  Part II,paragraph 3(1)(b).      The Department of Industry was informed by letter dated 30th September 1976, from Messrs. Ashurst, Morris,Crisp &amp; Co., solicitors to the Laird Group,  that in the &quot;relevantfinancial year&quot; i.e. that ended 31st December 1972, Howie did nottrade and Western had a turnover of  1,735,243,  so that neitherqualified for the  3.4 million turnover which by paragraph 3(1)(c)is made a condition for takeover.    Cammell Laird (Shiprepairers)Company Ltd. was, however, a member of the same group;    andthat company in the same relevant financial year had a turnoverof more than  5 million.    That company was on 31st July 1974 amember of the Laird Group to which Howie and Western belongedand accordingly its turnover could be reckoned with the turnoversof Howie and Western if-, but only if, on 31st December 1972 itWas &quot;engaged in the business of repairing, refitting ormaintaining ships&quot; as required by subpai-agraphs (l)(a) and (2)(b)of paragraph 3.    Messrs. Ashurst, Morris,  Crisp &amp; Co.  have informed the Department of Industry that on 31st July 1974,  CammellLaird (Shiprepairers) Ltd, had a contract with the Venezuelannavy for the refittin^o^^^^p^^oyers and a contract with the
Peruvian Government for the refitting of two other destroyers.These two contracts were entered into before 1972.    CammellLaird (Shiprepairers) Ltd. had sold their assets to the LairdGroup in 1972 and the work on the Venezuelan   and Peruviancontracts had been sub-contracted to Cammell Laird(Shipbuilders) Ltd. and Western Shiprepairers Ltd.    CammellLaird (Shiprepaii&quot;ers ) had no employees, it had no interestin possession in a dry-dock or graving dock and had no otherfixed assets.    There is some evidence that the directors ofCammell Laird (Shiprepairers) Ltd. continued to supervise theVenezuelan and Peruvian contracts.    We find that on 31st July1974 Cammell Laird (Shiprepairers) Ltd. was a member of thesame group of companies as J.B. Howie Ltd. and WesternShiprepairers Ltd. and that on 31st December 1972 the end of the relevant financial year, it was still marginally engaged inrepairing, refitting or maintaining .ships, and that,  therefore *its turnover may be aggregated with those of J.B. Howie Ltd.-and Western Shiprepairers Ltd.We now turn to the case of Humber St. AndrewsEngineering Company Ltd.    That company was on 31st July 197?repairing the Esquimaux and the Emerald in a dry-dock at Hullowned and operated by British United Trawliers (Hull) Ltd.and managed by Hellyer Brothers Ltd.;   and the Emerald was owncby Hellyer.    The three companies, British United Trawlers  (Hull)Ltd., Hellyer and Humber St. Andrews were members of the samegroup.    Humber St. Andrews had a turnover in the relevantfinancial year exceeding  3.4 million and was agreed to been gaged on 31st July 1974 in the business of repairing ships-In an answer given in the House of Lords on 14th October 1976,Lord Peart said that neither Hellycr Brothers, who booked thedry-dock, nor Humber St. Andrews, who was doing the repair55was entitled to a licence to occupy the di-y-dock.    What does the phrase &quot;entitled to a licence to occupy a dry-dock&quot; mean.It must; be something less than &quot;an interest in possession indry-dock&quot; which is the other dry-dock qualification imposedhv nar- 1   o/nw^s CONFIDENTIAL r,iUby paragraph 3(l)(b) of Part II of the Second Schedule to the I-
CONFIBhNlfALWe would expect it, on the other&apos;hand, to be something morethan the occupation of a dry-dock in pursuance of a bookingby the owner, charterer or manager of a ship occupying thedry-dock. No evidence has been given to us of any intermediate&quot;licence&quot; between an interest in possession and occupationunder a booking from the dock-owner. We find that HellyerBrothers Ltd. occupied the dry-dock on 31st July 1974.We are thus presented with the question whetherthe Bill is hybrid -first, because of the omission of WestminsterDredging Company notwithstanding that on 31st July 1974 itwas engaged in the business of repairing ships, albeit ina small way;second, because of the inclusion of the LondonGraving Dock Company, notwithstanding that its shiprepairingbusiness on 31st July 1974 was minimal;thir-d, because of the inclusion of J.B. Howie and western Shiprepairers notwithstanding that on 31st July 1974the shiprepniring business of Cammell Laird Shiprepairersby virtue of whose turnover those two companies are included,was minimal;fourth,    because of the exclusion of Humber St.Andrews Engiiieering Company on the ground that their work ina dry-dock on 31st July 1974 did not &quot;amount to an entitlement to a licence to occupy it.It has been urged on us on behalf of the Governmentthat we should not concern outselves with such trivialitiesland we agree -with the Government that they are indeedtrivialities.    We go further and say that they have littlebearing on the underlying question whether any of the companiesselected by the Bill for nationalization, and especially the twelve shiprepairing companies,  should be allowed to present their case to a Selc^P^SilSKcI^if the House.
It is at this point that the fundamental issue ofthis examination   presents itself.   We share the view expressed on behalf of the Government.that it is grotesque that theconstitutional right of a subject to plead his cause before a Select Committee of the House of Lords or the House ofCommons should depend on the answers to the kind of questionswe. have just mentioned.    Mr. Gamon, perhaps anticipatingthatthe shiprepairing activities of Westminster Dredging Companymight compel us to find that that company was engaged in thebusiness of repairing ships within the meaning of Part II D^the Schedule,  though not listed in Part I of the Schedule,suggested that we should look beyond the class described inparagraphs 1 and 3 of Part II of the Schedule to anunexpressed class, described by him as the &quot;genuine class&quot; oi:companies which are to be nationalized as shiprepairingcompanies.    He contended that the Government sought to bring into public ownership a genuine class of eighteen or so majorshiprepairing companies   and that Westminster Dredging Comp-s11/for instance, could not in ordinary parlance be described asa shiprepairing company at all.    It was almost exclusivelyengaged in dredging and land-reclamation.    But one must assume that those who framed the Bill shrank from a bare naming ofthe shiprepairing companies that the Government wanted to take*with or without some such description of them as &quot;the majorshiprepaix&quot;ing companies&quot;, because to do so would be to make anaked selection and so hybridise the Bill.    So they employedthe device adopted -in the two Iron and Steel nationalizationBills and blessed by the Rulings of Mr. Speaker Clifton-Brownand Mr. Speaker King.    That device, as we have&apos; said, was forthe Promoters to draw a class that would comprise the selectedcompanies and-no others.    That is the way the Govei-nment haschosen to play it.    The fact that the. class has been so draw&quot;as to include a company that the Government did not intend to include does    not justify us in ignoring the stated claS^jand relying on the unexpressed &quot;genuine&quot; class.    To do so W0amount to finding not &quot;only that clause 19(2) and the second schedule were ineffective buP&amp;r&quot;ICutMli!waiting something for 1that would itself hybridise the Bill.
We find that the Bill is hybrid in respect of the omission of the Westminster Dredging Company.    We find thatthe Bill is not hybrid with respect to the inclusion of theLondon Graving Dock Company, J.B. Howie, Western Shiprepairersand Humber St. Andrews.It will be seen that the minor shiprepairing businessof Westminster Dredging Company, a compnay outside Schedule II,is balanced by the minor shiprepairing businesses of LondonGraving Dock Company and Cammell Laird (Shiprepairers) whichhave brought London Graving Dock and J.B. Howie and WesternShiprepairers within Schedule II,There is another matter which raises the question ofhybridity.    In the Bill for the Iron and Steel Act 1967 the   &apos;Ruling of Mr.  Speaker King, to which we have already referred,Was to the effect that the description contained in that Bill ofthe companies selected for public ownership foi-med an adequateclass if the description was germane to the subject matter of theBill.    It Is not clear whether by this he meant germane to theIron and Steel Industry or germane to the companies selectedout of that industry for nationalization.    We think he meantthe first.    It was submitted to us that the condition inparagraph 3(1)(c) of Part II of the Second Schedule to the Billis not germane to the shiprepairing industry.    Paragraph 3(l)(c)deals with turnover and requires that the aggregate turnoverof the company concerned and of its associated shiprepairingcompanies must have exceeded  3.4 million Ln order to qualify&quot; for nationalisation;    but the turnover is not confined toturnover in the shiprepairing business and, in one company at least, the Humber Graving Dock and Engineering Company, some407o of the turnover required by the Bill was turnover in respectof business     that was not the business of shiprepairing.    Inother words the Government has decided, in the case of this company, to bring it into public ownership by reason of its size, but not solely^b^^eja^s^^of^jits size as shiprepairers.
We find that the Bill is hybrid in that the condition of turnoveris not germane to the subject matter of the Bill so far as it relates to the shiprepairing companies.It is also our duty to decide whether the Bill is or isnot hybrid in respect of the aircraft manufacturing industry andin respect of the shipbuilding, marine diesel engine andtraining industries.    We have&apos;received virtually no evidence about these;   but we accept Mr. Gamon?s assurance that, as far as he knows&quot;, there is no incongruity between Parts I and II of the FirSSchedule and Parts I and II of the Second Schedule so far as they relate to the shipbuilding, marine engine and training industries&apos;We accox-dingly find that the Bill is not hybrid on account of anysuch discrepancy.-Having pronounced our finding, we would add this.    ^e arconscious of the fact that Important sections of industry arewaiting for Parliament to decide whether, and to what extent,nationalization of certain companies is to proceed.    We are aiBconscious of the fact that, since this Bill is introduced withthe certificate from the Speaker pursuant to section 2(4) of th-Parliament Act 1911, the House of Lords will be unable in all-probability to give effect to any Petitions against the Bill&apos;Nevertheless, we have to do our best to decide whether theMemorialists and other parties affected by the Bill should begiven an opportunity to plead their case before a Select Commj-^of- the House.. &apos; We have not investigated to any great extent the origlnof the rules of both Houses regarding hybrid!ty.    We are, howevconvinced that they were designed by both Houses to ensure thathe subject should have a right to plead his cause before them;-crif he could show that their legislation would put him to Zredisadvantage than it would put. his fellows.    Parliament has? .other words, been careful to protect the individual from themajority, from the power of the state, or, if you prefer it*from the power of the GovernmeSQN FID E N TIA L
As we have indicated above the Ruling of Mr.  SpeakerKing and his predecessor, Mr. Speaker Clifton-Brown, have, wethink, almost completely lost sight of the fundamental purposesof the hybridity rule.    Governments are naturally very reluctant to submit major decisions of policy to the judgement of select committees, whether they be Committees of the House of Commonsor Committees of the House of Lords.    They,  therefore,  take greatpains to have their Bills drafted so as to avoid hybridity.We have already expressed our opinion that whether a Bill is oris not hybrid has degenerated into a question whether theParliamentary Counsel who draft Bills for the Government havebeen successful in drawing a class into which the undertakingsintended for nationalization can be fitted and which excludesthe undertakings that the Government does not wish to nationalizeand It is curious that the answer to the question whether a constitutional right of such importance as the fight of a subject:to plead his cause before Committees of either House mightdepend on the opinion of Officers of the House about the meaning of such phrases as &quot;engaged in the business of repairing, refittiior maintaining ships&quot; and &quot;entitled to a license to occupy a dry-dock or graving dock&quot;.The draftsman of this Bill was assigned an Impossibletask.    It was difficult enough for him to make Part II of hisSecond Schedule&apos;cover all the companies in Part 11    but when it came to ensuring that no other company fulfilled the conditionsin Part II5 he had to rely on such information as the Governmentcould glean   from sources that were not always sympathetic.*tad he had the knowledge available to us, he would in all probability have succeeded.    As it was, that knowledge was deniedhim, and the attempt failed.
ANNEX BTHE INDUSTRIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF DELAY TOTHE AIRCRAFT AND SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRIES bill memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for IndustryINTRODUCTIONThis note examines the industrial and economic implications of delay to the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill.    It isWritten on what it must take to be the most likely assumption ie&quot;that the Bill would not become an Act until November and that&quot;Vesting .day would be in February 1978.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP REPAIRING2      For warship building a deferment of public ownership will nothave any substantial industrial or economic implications but it will put back ovir thinking abo\it the scope for a modest expansion of our export business in small warships.3 ^    A delay to the Bill will have an adverse effect on theshiprepairing industry in putting back much needed investment whichQf course is most unlikely to be forthcoming under private ownershiplf shiprepairing is excluded from the Bill.    It could also lead toP*ie or more early closures by shiprepairing companies who have beenhuyirig orders at a loss and are not willing to carry on, but theirProblem would of course have to be faced in the event of nationalisation.4      The most serious problem lies with the merchant shipbuilderswhere the public corporation is needed to:i make, and put into effect, plans for a merchant shipbuilding-industry that will be able to stand on its own feet; it isdifficult to get effective long-term planning and unrealistic to expect any significant new investment by the individual companies while the public ownership issue remains unsettled;ii channel the funds available from the Selective InterventionFund to the yards where they can be used most effectively:until we have access to company records after nationalisationwe lack the informat-Wia.saq-drEp^eri to do this.
i     4. *      4-v      - *   f CONFIDENTIAL ...5      Apart from these industrial considerations, until theCorporation is formed the Government itself will bear the mainbrunt of difficult decisions on the allocation of aid and hencealleged responsibility for redundancies although, of course, wecould not escape political pressure to intervene in such decisions even after nationalisation.    In addition ,   until the^Corporation is formed, the shipyard workers redundancy scheme isin suspense though we have still to find an opportunity of discussing this with the trade unions.6       However, unless we run into difficulties with the e.c. commission-the availability of the new Intervention Fund provides a means of avoiding the threatened collapse of the merchant shipbuilders and ^the creation of National Shipbuilders and Repairers Limitediprovidea useful instrument for action for securing orders for the industry&apos;7       In summary, delay to the Bill could have long term costs, and involve serious political and administrative difficulties for theGovernment in administering the Intervention Fund, but with the nevpolicy initiative referred to above the delay would, not causeirreparable damage.    On the basis of current policies we can get oy,though perhaps only just.    And it is of course mistaken to imagine that nationalisation itself will not carry with it considerable political and administrative problems.AIRCRAFT8       The aircraft &quot;industry is running down, mainly because of fall111volume of work on civil aircraft.    It is almost inevitable that employment will drop by over 10% (5,000) over the next -/&quot;ear or so.The scale of run down thereafter will depend significantly ondecisions yet to be taken.9       There is only one civil aircraft whose launch might quickly., ^affect these prospects - the HS146 which as at present formulateda doubtful proposition.    Whether it will prove a worthwhile     : .proposition on which to expend the funds of the public corporatioremains to be seen: it will certainly not go ahead under private ownership unless the Government meets all the main cost.10     The only other immediate significant possibility is the cnancethat we might secure a major overseas sale of the BAC111 to Roman   &apos;Japan or India.    The prospect of securing one of these contractsnot significantly affected by the nationalisation issue.11     In the slightly longer term, the main potential prospect apa-from the HS146 lies in overseas collaboration.    Negotiations a?6currently taking place which require series of actions commencingsoon and ending in long-term commitments, or otherwise, perhaps    .gCwithin the next 12 months.    These need a strong single UK enterpto negotiate with the overseas companies and this is needed soon^nFollow up action with Boeing, the strongest possibility, is due ^March and could be prejudiced.    Any loss of such overseas pi&apos;0yeCrwould be serious.    Meanwhile pressure is mounting from the urn011for positive Government action on new civil projects to safegualong-term employment.
E G V18 FEBRUARY 1977312     Against this, there is no certainty that the negotiations onthe collaborative projects will in fact come to a head in the next6 months or so and there could be advantage if some of theinescapable run down in manpower took place before nationalisation.Moreover if the negotiations did come to a head it might bepossible to persuade the two main companies to adopt a more united front.    This might conceivably be done through the organising committee for British Aerospace if that can be kept in being:   itsChairman takes the view which may, or may not, prove correct, thatcontinued uncertainty will cause it to drift apart.CONCLUSIONS13     For all the industries affected a prolongation of uncertaintyis itself damaging and involves risks to employment.14-     For shipbuilding, delay to nationalisation will cause somelong-term damage to the industry.    But the policy initiatives now decided on will avert serious immediate damage.    Delay will make the selective Intervention Fund less effective and increase the period for which aid is needed, though assistance will still be neededafter nationalisation through British Shipbuilders.    It will leadto some political embarrassment to the Government in administering the Intervention Fund.    But the Intervention Fund problem is notdecisive unless we come to grief in the e.c..15     For ship repairers delay is likely to precipitate closures, but so would a decision to exclude them from the Bill.16 Eor aircraft there is a risk that delay will prejudice important&quot;business opportunities of major long term importance.
ANT7EX C, THE AIRCRAFT. AND SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRIES BILL AND THE PARLIAT&apos;IENT ACTS, 1911 AND 19491.       Section 2 of the Parliament Act 1911 (as amended by the 1949 Act) applies wherea public Dill is passed by the House of Commons in each of two successive Sessions,is sent to the House of Lords at least a month before the end. of both these Sessions,and is rejected by the Lords in each of these Sessions.     On its rejection by the lords on the second occasion then, unless the Commons direct to the contrary, theBill is presented for Royal Assent and becomes law in the form desired by the CommonsA Bill is deemed to be rejected by the Lords if it is not passed by them eitherwithout amendment or only with such amendments as may be agreed to by both Houses.Before the Bill is presented for the Royal Assent, the Speaker must certify underSection 2(2) that the provisions of the Section have been duly complied with.2.       The Bill sent to the Lords in the second. Session counts as the same as the Billsent up in the preceding Session if it is identical, or contains only amendmentscertified by the- Speaker under Section 2(4) to be required because of the lapse oftime or to be the same as amendments made by the Lords in the preceding Session.(There is also a procedure for the Commons to suggest amendments to the Lords, not relevant to this case.) -3.       The Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill was rejected by the Lords last session within the meaning of the Parliament Acts (in that they insisted upon amend-ments excluding ship-repairing which the Commons did not accept).     It has been sentback to the Lords this Session in a form which fulfils the conditions as to form laiddown in the Acts;   the Speaker has so certified, having rejected representations madeto him in the House that the Bill did not comply with them.4.       The fact that the Bill has now been declared hybrid is not thought to effect the application of the Parliament Acts.     A hybrid Bill is a public Bill to whichStanding Orders relating to private business are applicable;    it is still a publicBill within the meaning of xhe Parliament Acts.     A suggestion to the contrary wasmade in the course of the proceedings before the Examiners on the Aircraft and shipbuilding Industries Bill, but is considered to be invalid.     The Aircraft endShipbuilding Industries Bill could be presented for the Royal Assent under the parliament Acts at the end of the present Session regardless of whether the Lordshad completed their consideration of it.     The Examiners say in the last paragraph-but three of their report:   &quot;Since this Bill is introduced with the certificate from
the Speaker pursuant to Section 2(4) of the Parliament Act, 1911, the House of Lordswill bC unable in all probability to give effect to any petitions against the Bill&quot;.5.      The rejection &quot;by the Lords of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill this session, within the meaning of the Parliament Acts, could occur in one of several ways.The Loid.s might simply reject the Bill on Second or Third Reading, but this is not expected.     Second, the Lords could fail to complete consideration of the Bill by theend of the Session;   as noted above, the Bill could then be submitted for Royal Assent.Third, the Lords could amend the Bill in ways not agreed to by the Commons.     If thetwo Houses had not resolved any differences of opinion over such amendments by the endof the Session, the Bill could be submitted for Royal Assent.     Fourth, the Commonsmight accept some Lords amendments but not others;   and again, if the Lords did not give way, the Bill could be submitted for Royal Assent with the amendments accepted &quot;bythe Commons.     If, however, the Lords amended the Bill and all their amendments were agreed to by the Commons, the Bill would be submitted for Royal Assent in the normal way and no question of invoking the Parliament Acts would arise.     Equally, if the lords amended the Bill, the Commons rejected some or all of these amendments, and the lords then accepted the will of the Commons, the Bill would go forward for royal assent in the normal way.6.       The Parliament Acts are so drafted that, if the Lords amend 3. Bill sent up froBthe Commons in the second successive Session, the Commons may have an opportunity toconsider whether to accept the Lords amendment(s).     The Acts also contemplate that,before a Bill is submitted for the Royal Assent in accordance with their provisions,the Commons have the power to &quot;direct otherwise&quot;, ie to decide not to invoke the parliament Acts after all.     But it does not appear to be essential that the Common!&quot;&apos;should consider any Lords amendments, or should consider whether to &quot;direct otherwise if, by the end of the second Session, the Lords have failed to pass the Bill in theform in which it was sent up by the Commons, the Bill can then be submitted forRoyal Assent regardless of whether the Commons have given the Bill any furtherconsideration since the completion of the Lords proceedings.     If such a situation were to arise in the case of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, theOpposition might put down a Motion inviting the Commons to direct that the Bill be tiO*submitted for Royal Assent.     The Government would not have to provide time for such 3Motion, and it seems doubtful whether it could be taken on a Supply Day.     If,however, the Opposition were by any means able to secure a debate on such a Motion,the Government would have to secure the rejection of the Motion or the Bill would fal1
7&apos;      To cum up, the Parliament Acts provide a means of ensuring that the AircraftBad Shipbuilding Industries Bill can he submitted for Royal Assent by the end ofthis Session, either in its present form or with any amendments agreed to by the commons, regardless of any action taken by the Lords.     This position is not affected by hybridity;   but the use of the Parliament Acts might possibly require afurther successful vote in the Commons at the end of the Session.     If, as part ofsome bargain, amendments to the Bill &quot;were, to be made by the Lords and agreed to bj&quot;the Commons, and there was no dispute between the two Houses, the question ofinvoking the Parliament Acts would not arise, and the Bill would be submitted forRoyal Assent in the usual v:ay.
