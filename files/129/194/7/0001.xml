ROAD TRAFFIC CASUALTIES bill note by OfficialsThis paper sets out the facts and considerations relevant to the optionsdiscussed by the Cabinet on 13 January (CM(77) 1st Conclusions, Minute 1)for securing the required savings, at 1976 Survey prices, of  20 million in1977-78 ( 40 million in a full year) in the National Health Service (NHS)costs of treating road accident casualties.2.     The basic choice lies betxveen recoupment of the money from motor insurersby means of a levy and its more direct recoupment from vehicle users.   Under&quot;these heads the options are as follows.RECOUPMENT FROM INSURERS3.     The original such proposal approved by Home Affairs Committee at theend of July would have left it to insurers to decide how premiums should be adjusted to meet.the amounts levied from each insurer by the Government.The insurers, however, were strongly opposed to the incorporation of thecharge in premiums not only because brokers would then be entitled to commission on it but because they did not wish to become involved indisputes with motorists about increases in premiums or about the applica-&quot;tion of no claim bonus arrangements.   They regarded the proposed levy as^ additional tax on motorists and would no doubt do their best to representMi as such (it would almost certainly be ruled as a taxing measure for parliamentary purposes).f*     There are also possible objections from the Governmental and publicviewpoints -i.     The insurers would be left with a wide discretion to settle the incidence of the charge (or tax) on individuals.   They might well decide on a flat rate increase, to identify it clearly as a tax and save them-selves argument.   Or they might distribute the burden by a percentage increase on premiums:   this would favour the vehicle owner payingsmaller premiums for third party personal injury risks only andpenalise comprehensive insurance - the reverse of what public policy
should aim at;    there appears to be no way of charging a percentage onthe third party element only of the premium since insurers cannot, orwill not, distinguish this from the rest of a premium for comprehensive-sive cover.ii. The additional costs imposed by the statutory requirements forminimum solvency margins and by brokers (who handle about 55 Perof motor insurance business) claiming the usual commission, could amountto 90p on top of an average charge of  3 per vehicle.iii. Because of the time needed for further discussions with insurers,og about the method of assessing them for levy, and for the drafting of a new Bill, Second Reading could scarcely take place until after easter;   and the sum which could be recovered in 1977-78 would therefore be well below  20 million.5.     The possible objection at i. above would be removed if the Bill were to direct insurers how to recoup the money.   But, apart from the difficulty of deciding what form the direction should take, this would considerably widen the field of debate in Parliament;    and the   continuing problem thereafterof motorists1 resentment at increases in premiums following accidents inwhich they were involved (but for which they did not think themselvesresponsible) would tend to be laid at the Government*s door.6.     At Cabinefs discussion the possibility was raised of recovering theactual cost of each accident from the insurance company concerned.   This isthe principle of the Road Traffic Act but recovery is limited by that Actto cases where the insured is liable for damages.   There are basic objectionsof principle to extending the Act to cover the costs of any accident regardleof motorists^ liability, and the additional receipts in 1977-78 xrould in anycase be very small.   See paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Annex.RECOUPMENT   PROM MOTORISTS (INCLUDING COMMERCIAL VEHICLES)a.     The draft Road Traffic Casualties Bill7.     The draft Bill provides for a flat rate charge per vehicle, fixed by ^eGovernment;   and for this to be collected by the insurers as agents, along with but distinct from the premium.   The scheme therefore does not discrimin0
between good and bad risk drivers;    and it will involve substantial administra-tive costs, at least initially, for insurers and their agents which will beborne by motorists as the insured interests will no doubt stress in Parliament.On the other hand, although the Bill has been ruled   technically to be a taxingmeasure, it would create a statutory link between the charge and KHS roadaocident costs;    it offers the only scheme in which the co-operation of insurersseems reasonably likely;    and it could probably be introduced soon enough tosecure the required savings in 1977-78.*     A,.tax i-ncrease.8.     In principle, a simpler alternative to a charge fixed and collected onthe above lines would be an equivalent increase in either Vehicle Excxsefcrty (VED) or the road fuel duty.   The required increase in annual VED on car sand commercial vehicles to ensure the same revenue would be  2 in 1977-78 and 3 or  4 in 1978-79.   The required increase in the duty on petrol and dervwould be 0.5p i a gallon and 1p a gallon.9.     The treasury see three objections to this option.   The first is thatit would breach the fundamental principle of non-hypothecation of tax revenue&quot;hich has so far remained intact.   The second objection is that it wouldPre-emp-t the Chancellor^ revenue - raising power, reducing his fiscalflexibility in 1977-78 and thereafter, and prejudicing the realisation ofhis publicly stated taxation objectives.   The third is that it would rule outPossibility of treating the money recovered as a public expenditure saving,background to this is as follows.   Since legislation of the kind proposed111 the draft Road Traffic Casualties Bill involved a levy or charge to recovertreatment costs, it was agreed to treat the measure as a saving in public expenditure, and it was announced by the Chancellor in July as part of thee^expenditure reductions.   Full account was taken of the reductions from the&quot;fcasure in 1977-78 and subsequent years in the totals agreed with the^national Monetary Fund in the recent negotiations and included in thelGtter of intent.   In December Counsel ruled that the Bill was a taxingme^re which meant that the proceeds would be payable to the ConsolidatedBut, given the purposes of the measure, current expenditure on the** will be shown net of receipts in the coming Public Expenditure White Paper.1 ^aigh-t tax inorease, however, on VED or fuel duty, could not be treatedln i*ia way.3
10.   There could also he problems of timing, depending on how long it wouldbe possible to delay making any announcement of decisions to abandon theproposed legislation to recoup road accident costs and to make an increasein WD or fuel duty instead.   Such an increase would have to be made in the spring budget and be the subject of Budget Resolutions and of subsequentFinance Bill clauses.   An announcement, in advance of the Budget, of anintended increase would run the risk of forestalling action by the public at appreciable cost to the revenue.   In the case of road fuel duty there could be heavy anticipatory stocking and buying;    in the case of VED it wouldbe open to motorists to re-license their vehicles and have the unexpircdportion of their licence refunded.11.   Annexed is a note on subsidiary points raised in the Cabinet1s last discussion.   These relate to the existing scheme under the Road traffic act (paragraph 6 above), the suggestion of an increase in the NHS element of national insurance and the funding arrangements for payments by the motor Insurers&apos; Bureau to the victims of uninsured and untraced drivers.Cabinet Office17 January 1976-4
&apos; ANNEXROAD TRAFFIC ACT PROVISIONS&apos;l&apos;he Road Traffic Act at present enables hospitals and doctors to recoversome treatment costs direct from insurers;   the liability is covered byinsurers in fixing their premiums.     Recovery of costs is limited by theAct to those instances where the insurer makes a payment in respect ofinjuries to third parties under the insurance policy.     This is themain reason why the NHS recovers only about  1 million a year when thefull cost of NHS treatment is around  40-45 million.     The system is alsoadministratively cumbersome and involves long delays in hospitals receivingpayments.2&apos; The principal objection to widening this scheme to recover&quot;the individual costs of more accidents is that it would be a big step inthe direction of imposing direct liability when there is no fault by themotorist;   and it would be particularly undesirable to take this step in advance of the report of the Pearson Commission on Civil Liability.I&quot;t would also be difficult to provide for identifying the responsibleinsurer in each case, the amounts likely to be recovered would beuncertain, and recovery would be slow.     Additional receipts in 1977-78would ba small.     Insurance premiums would have to go up, on average by^ound  3 and the insurers would no doubt present this as a. new Government-^vy?   while possibly disguising other increases under this umbrella-,i&quot; A minor improvement in the present Road Traffic Act scheme wouldDe a simple amendment to the Act to remove the present ceiling of  200Per case.     However, as the current average cost of in-patient treatmentof a road casualty is of the order of  356, the additional amountRecoverable if the present scheme were amended in this way would be little
more than  1 million or  2 million.     Furthermore, because of the tinetaken by insurers to determine liability       whether any payment is to&quot;made in each case, very little additional revenue would be collected Whealth authorities in 1977-78.NHS ELEMENT OP NATIONAL INSURANCE4* An increase in the NHS element of national insurance hasbeen suggested.     This of course would represent an additional charge on all employers and employees and would bear no relation to roadaccidents.     It would be liable to strong opposition, given that asubstantial addition has already been made in this field with theintroduction of the national insurance surcharge.     It is in any caselate to consider this for 1977-78 as the re-rating order affectingnational inuurance contributions has already been approved by the Ho^3&apos;MOTOR INSURERS&quot; BUREAU:   FUNDING5. Payments made by the Bureau to victims of uninsured anddrivers amount to  4 - 5 million a year.     (The Bureau also makes p-&quot;arising from insurance failures, but these are currently reducing asthe effects of past failures are overtaken.)     These payments are ^by a corresponding levy on each member insurer in proportion to gros5income from motor insurance premiums. -Any dispute between the Bur^&quot;and a member insurer is referred to an arbitrator appointed by the ^of the Law Society.     This basis of levy means that insurers9 contr^ft Ito Bureau funds (and therefore that of their policy holders) include8 &apos;element attributable to premiums paid for cover other than againstfor persona! injury   Since, however, gross premium income is about 700 million per annum, the contribution itself is very small (less1 per cent) and the element derived from non-personal injury insura&quot;&quot;smaller.
