1DIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLYNote by officials at its meeting on 10 February (when it considered a draft White Paper on direct elections to the European Assembly) Cabinet asked that &quot;officials should ..... prepare a memorandum on the electoral practices of our .Community partners and the options, including the single list and the dualmandate, which it would be wpen to us to adopt.&quot;    (CM(77) 5th Conclusions,Minute 6),ELECTORAL SYSTEMS IN THE OTHER MEMBER STATES2.     In their national elections, five Member States (Belgium, Denmark,Italy, Luxembourg and tho Netherlands) use systems of proportional representation based on national or regional party lists.   A sixth, theFederal German Republic, uses a mixed system under which half the members are elected from single member constituencies and half from regional partyHats.   The Irish Republic uses the single transferable vote in 3 to 5 member constituencies, and Prance has a single member constituency system with asecond ballot*3.     The amount of work done to date on the arrangements for direct electionsvaries from country to country.   It is however already clear that all ap .rtfrom Ireland (which will again use STV) propose to use a form of listAstern.   In Germany and France this will mean using different systems in national and European elections.The details are summarised in Annex A country by country..^impossible ELECTORAL SYSTEMS FOR DIRECT ELECTIONS5*     A very large number of electoral systems have been devised over theV3ars,   The main variable factors are: single or multi-member constituencies;*fce information on the ballot paper; the method of voting; the method ofhunting; and the allocation of seats for votes.
6.     The first-past-the-post system usod for Westminster elections is oftendescribed as the &quot;relative majority&quot; or &quot;simple majority&quot; system,   It isbased on the single member constituency; each elector has one vote which hecAsts for &quot;r-hc Jiamed candidate of his choice.7.     Most other systems introduce variations designed to produce results which are more closely proportionate to the votes cast and uro known by the collective name of proportional representation (Hi).    Tho main variants arca. the alternative vote;b. tho double-ballot system;c. the single transferable vote (STV) system;d. the additional member system;c.     lists.Annex B contains a short note on these systems together with tho dual manda^18 February 19772
ANNEX ADIRECT ELECTIONS:    ELECTORAL SYSTEMS IN THE OTHER MEMBER STATES1.     BELGIUM1.     The Chamber of Representatives has 212 members elected from 30constituencies which return between 3 and 32 seats in each constituency.     Thepolitical parties present lists of candidates in each constituency (with separate lists of substitutes to fill casual vacancies).     The elector mayvote either for the list or for a particular candidate on that list.     the votes cast for a particular candidate count as a vote for the list of which heis a member.     List votes and candidates votes are added together ineach constituency to find the total number of votes cast and the number of votes cast for each party in that constituency.     The total of votes cast is divided by the number of seats in the constituency to find the electoral quota and each party&apos;s constituency total is then divided by this quota, tofind the number of seats which it has won.     Votes for a list go to the candidates in the order their names appear on the list, but personal votesgo to the candidates concerned and may result in lower candidates being elected over the heads of those above.2.     Since the last election which was held in 1974j there are 5 mainParties represented in the Chamber, plus a sprinkling of Communists andsplinter groups.3.     Direct Elections;    Discussions are continuing about the arrangements for direct elections.     It seems certain there will be some form of party listsystem.     A row has developed over the division of constituencies betweenFlanders, Wallonia and Brussels.     In an effort to overcome this linguistic/communal problem, Mr Tindemans has suggested a single constituency for thewhole country, ie a single national list.
2.     DENMARK1.    The Folketlug is a single Chamber Parliament with 179 seats.     Denmarkuses a list system of considerable complexity.     The end result is howeversimple.     Each party obtaining more than 2 per cent of the total vote is represented in the Folketing in almost exact proportion to the votes it received at the election.2.     135 of the Folketing seats are divided between constituencies according ^0the distribution of population.     These &quot;constituency&quot; seats will be filled maccordance with the number of votes received by each party in each constituency&apos;Parties present lists in each constituency.     Electors may vote for alist or for an individual candidate whose prospects of election are advanced bythe size of his personal vote.     A further 40 &quot;supplementary&quot; seats will ^eallotted in such a way as to give each party a total number of seats correspond^to its share of the national vote provided this is at least 2 per cent,addition, the Faroes and Greenland each have 2 seats.3.     Administrations have been based on a coalition or on Government by asingle party, depending for its majority on support from some part of theopposition.     However, the life of Danish Governments has, until very recently, been relatively long.     [Elections are being held on 15 February&apos;J4.     Direct Elections:    The outgoing Government has consulted the FolketingMarkets Committee about a draft bill which would provide for elections based 0X1a list system, with the whole of Denmark forming one constituency andGreenland a separate constituency with one seat.     The Social DemocratGovernment insisted at the time of signature of the Direct Elections InstrumeUJofon two reservations, to permit e. compulsory dual mandate and the coincidenceEuropean and their national elections.     More recently however they recognithat they were unlikely to command a majority in the Folketing for thesereservations and appeared to be preparing to give them up:   the draft bill-provided for either possibility.     It remains to be seen what line a nowDanish Government will take.sed2
3.     italy.     The Italian Chamber of Deputies consists of 630 members elected from32 constituencies which return from 5 to 36 members each.   Each partypresents a list of candidates.   The voter may indicate his preferenceamong the candidates or write in additional names.    (The number ofpreference votes for each elector depends on the size of constituenciesbut is usually three or four,).   Alternatively the voter may vote for a party list as it stands.    The list votes are added up to find each party&apos;total vote in that constituency.   Votes remaining after the party&apos;s totalvote in each constituency has been divided by the electoral quota aretransferred to a national pool from which any seats still not assigned arcdistributed according to the party&apos;s share of the national poll.2.     Party allegiance in Italy has been remarkably consistent over thelast 30 years with overall swings rarely exceeding 3*5 Per cent until the regional and national elections of the last two years.   Tnere are current17 main groupings in the Chamber, plus a few splinter groups.3o     Direct Eloptions:   Discussion of the electoral arrangements is still at an early stage among the parties.   Although a ratification bill hasalready been introduced it appears however to be common ground that theelections should be based on lists for regions or groups of regions.3
4-     LUXEMBOURGlo     The Chanber of Deputies consists of 58 members with fotxr consti-constituencies each electing 6-18 members.   Party lists nay contain as ma.nynames as there are seats in the constituency.   The voter may give a voteto a party list alone in which case it counts as one vote for each candi-date on that list, or the voter nay cast his votes individually giving upto two votes for the sane candidate and if he wishes spreading his votesover more than one party list.   Each party is given seats according to its total of list votes and of votes for its individual candidaxes.   There areat present 5 parties in the Chanber of Deputies.2.     Direct Elections:   A Working Party of the Chanber of Deputies hasbeen charged with drawing up the enabling legislation.   Luxcnbourg&apos;s six members will probably bo elected on a single national list.4
5-     NETHERLANDS1.     The Lower House contains 150 members.    These are in effect electedfrom the whole country as one constituency, hut there are 18 votingdistricts.   Any 25 electors within a voting district may nominate a listof candidates.   The voter selects one of the lists and marks one only ofthe candidates on it.   The votes cast for candidates of the sane party areadded up to find the party&apos;s total valid vote.   Each party is allottedseats in proportion to its national total of votes on the basis of anelectoral quota.    Candidates whose votes equal or exceed the quota areelected.    Surplus votes over the quota are transferred to other candidates.No party may participate in the share-out of seats unless it has in its total vote reached the electoral quota (ie the total number of valid votesdivided by the number of seats.)    This low threshold (O.672 of the totalvote) has resulted in a good many minor parties being represented (thelast elections held in 1972 produced 14) with consequent delay in forming a Government,    However, once formed Dutch administrations have on the whole&quot;been long-lived.2,     Direct Elections:    The Bill to be presented to Parliament later in theyear will provide for a list system based on a single national constituency,similar to the.t used in national elections.5
6,   THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY1o   Tho Bundestag has 496 seats (not including the non-voting representativesof West Berlin).   After the war, elections were held in the American andFrench zones on the basis of proportional representation, but in the british zone a compromise was adopted between the proportional and the first-past-the-P05&apos;&apos;system.   It is this mixed system which is now used throughout the Federal Rep^W-1Thore are 248 single member constituencies and 248 further seats divided betweenthe 10   Lander according to each Lander^s proportion of the total electorate.The voter has two votes.   The first vote is cast for an individual candidatein a   constituency (as in a Westminster election) and the second for a partylist.   248 deputies are elected in single member constituencies by these firstvotes on the relative majority principle.   The other 248 are elected by thesharing out of the remaining seats among the parties in each land so that eachpart in the Bundestag has the sane proportion of seats as it has of the totalsecond vote,   (Occasionally a party wins more constituency scats than its total entitlement,  in which case it keeps its extra seats and the total numberof seats in the Bundestag is increased accordingly.)    Constituency candidatesare chosen by the party organisations in the Lander, or by groups of electors-list nominations are all made by the parties.   If the candidate wins both ona Land Party list and an individual seat, he takes the individual seat andhis name is removed from the party list.   The voter may split his vote byvoting for a candidate of a different party from the one whose list he favours&quot;2.   It is the second vote for the party list which decides the composition i11terms of parties of the Bundestag as a whole   But in order to participate in the share-out of the 248 indirectly elected seats, a party must firstsecure either, at least 5 per cent of the total   second vote, or, what isin practice more difficult, three scats in the direct constituency elections^The FDP for instance, who won 39 seats in the 1976 elections, have not wona single constituency seat on the first vote since 1953 but they have alwaysqualified for representation by obtaining more than 5 per cent of the totalvote.   As a result of the 5 per cent threshold the large parties arc sliS^ ^over represented.   Since 1961 no party ha,s obtained an overall majority 0^seats and Government has been by coalition of two of the three party groupino^represented in the Bundestag.
3.   Direct Elections;   The parties are currently being consulted in confidenceon a-preliminary draft, which provides for elections on the basis of federal lists with a 5 per cent qualifying hurdle.   There is no provision for individual constituency representation.
81.     The Dail has 144 seats with 42 constituencies each with 3, 4 or 5 seatselected by single transferable   vote.   Most candidates are selected by partiesbut there are always a number of Independents.   To be elected a candidate hasto reach a quota of one vote more than a quarter of the total valid votes ina three-seat constituency, one more than one-fifth in a four-seat constituencyand one more than one-sixth in a five-seat constituency (this is known as theDroop formula).   The elector votes by numbering in the order of his preferenceas many of the candidates as he wishes.   The voter is thereby indicating wherehis support should go a0 if the candidate of his first choice has secured morethan enough votes for election, or b. if his first choice has secured too fewvotes for election.   The votes which would not be used to elect anyone either because he already has sufficient, or because ho has too few ever to be elected arc then redistributed amongst other conadidates in accordance with ^epreferences expressed by the voters.   When the surplus votes have been added or&quot;transferred&quot; to the remaining candidates&apos; original first preference votes,any candidate whoso total vote (io first preference vote plus transferred votes)now exceeds the quota is declared elected and his surplus over the quota re-examined for second or third preferences and transferred to the relevant candidProportional representation wa.s first used in pro-partition Ireland in 19&quot;!9 &apos;t0encourage participation of the Protestant minority.2B     The effect of STV in the Republic has been to prevent a landslide for any party although there have been enough clear majorities to ensure that almost all Governments have been drawn from one party only.   There arc at present3 parties in the Dail plus 3 Independents.3.     Direct Elections:   The Irish Government have announced that the draftlegislation under preparation will provide for election by the STV systembased on four regional constituencies.   The Government have also publishedthe boundaries of the 4 constituencies proposed, which have come under some criticism from the Opposition.!
8._ france.     The National Assembly is elected on a two ballot system from singlemember constituences, 470 in metropolitan France and 17 overseas.   As inBritish elections the voter votes directly for the candidate he supports.The votes cast in the first ballot are counted and if no candidate has securedan absolute majority over all his opponents those candidates who received at least 10 per cent of the electorate1 s support are permitted to go forward&quot;to the second ballot one week later.   The second ballot is final and a candidatemay be elected by a relative or absolute majority.     Recent French electionsindicate that the second ballot produces no more proportional results than theBritish first-past-the-post system eg in 1968 the Gaullists won 45 per cent ofthe vote and gained 74 per cent of the seats,2.     Presidential elections differ from the election to the Assembly in tworespects.   The second ballot takes place two weeks after the first; and for that&quot;ballot only the two leading candidates may take part.3,     In general the system provides electoral majorities based on alliancesrather than coherent parliamentary party groupings.S     Direct Elections:   The French Foreign Minister has publicly stated that theGovernment will propose elections by proportional representation on a nationallist system.   The choice of a national as opposed to regional lists is in line with the Constitutional Council&apos;s ruling of 30 December whioh referred to theindivisibility of France as an electoral unit.   Leading Caullists had previously indicated that the use of a national list was a precondition fortheir support.917o2j77.
ANNEX possible ELECTORAL SYSTEMS FOR DIRECTELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLY^   ^he Alt international i ve Vot e* The alternative vote is a method whereby the voter&apos;s preferences, between^candidates in a single member constituency are taken into account to ensure thataH those elected are elected with an absolute majority of votes.   The voterPlaces the candidates in order of preference by writing the numbers 1, 2, 3e&quot;tc beside their names; 1 being the first preference, 2 the second and so&apos; on.If n  &apos;a candidate receives more than 50 per cent of the first preferences, he isdeclared elected.   If not, the candidate with the lowest number of votes is^ioinated and his votes are redistributed according to the&apos; second preferencesshovn.   The process is repeated until one candidate attains more than 50 Per cent0^ the total vote.   The system is used in elections to the Australian House of^Presentativos. &apos;* The; Double Ballot System&apos;   This is a variant of the alternative vote system.   Electors vote for Only-S^Qjianed candidate at the first ballot; if no candidate secures an absolutea0ority over all his opponents, then a second ballot is held. For the secondkollot, the bottom candidate is eliminated whatever his share of the vote, and0llly candidates who achieved a certain percentage (say 10 per cent) of possibleQtea in&apos;the first ballot go forward.   The second ballot..is&apos;on first-past-the-0s&quot;t principles.   The system is used in France.&apos;   Single Transferable Vote (STV)-*   The single transferable vote (STV) system of proportional representation (PR)Plates in a multi-member constituency situation.   In this system account is^0ft not only of a voter&apos;s first choice of candidate but also of his second and^sequent preferences.   The voter narks on.his ballot paper his order ofTerence (1, 2, 3 etc) for all (named) candidates.   By doing so, he isltl(iicating where his support should go if -either the candidate of his first choice has already secured enoughvotes for election.or his first choice is eliminated because he has secured too fewvotes to stand any chance of election.1
The surplus votes of the candidate already elected and the votes for a candidatewho is eliminated are redistributed to the other candidates in accordance withvoters&apos; expressed preferences.   The process of elimination and redi stribution is continued until all the vacancies are filled by candidates reaching the electoral quota.   The exact means of calculating the electoral quota and procedure forredistributing surplus and other votes vary according to the-precise systemselected.   The STV system is. used in the Republic of Ireland, Australia(elections to the Senate) and in local elections in Northern Ireland.   Underthis system, constituencies must be large-enough   to return at least three members.   For European Assembly elections, Wales (4 seats).and Northern Ireland(3 seats) could each constitute a single constituency.   With 8 seats Scotlandcould technically be made to form one constituency, but it might be found more acceptable to have a larger number of constituencies.    In England the constituenccould be formed on a regional or county basis, possibly;using the boundary commission, both to decide on the Boundaries and on the numbers of seats within each constituency varying from a minimum ofthree upwards.   The larger the numberof constituencies the more controversial it would be simply to delineate theirlimits in a Bill as opposed to using the Boundary Commission.do   The Additional Member System4.   Under the additional member system, a proportion of the total members arelected by the first-past-the-post, relative majority system in single member constituencies.   The remaining members are selected, in one of a number of waV &apos;with the aim of making the total number of seats for each party proportionate to the total number of votes cast for that party.   The extent to which this can be achieved depends on the proportion of total seats filled by election in constituencies.   In West Germany, this is half the total.   In the system-proposed in June 1976 by the Hansard Society Commission on Electoral Reform,it is 75 PGr cent.   In the system proposed by Mr Anthony Kershaw andMr John Mackintosh for elections to the proposed Scottish and Welsh AssemblioS&apos;but heavily defeated in Committee, it is just over 70 per cent.   The method   ywhich individuals arc allocated the additional seats also varies; the namesnay be taken from a party list or from the list of unsuccessful candidates inaccordance with a prescribed formulao
e*   List Systems .;- .: ; &apos; &apos;.5*   There are various forms of the list system.   At one extreme (as in Israel)&quot;the same &quot;ballot paper is used for tho whole country.   It contains the names of the political parties alone and the elector may vote for only one party.Scats are then allocated .to each party in proportion to their total vote;indviduals to fill those seats are.selected by the party machine, usually on&quot;the basis .of a previously published list.  .      -60   Alternatively, the country may be divided into constituencies and the ballot paper may contain.the parties or the names of all the candidatesnominated for that particular constituency.   Sometimes voters can express a preference for particular candidates within one party. -Lists may also be.organised on a regional as well as a constituency basis,, with the regional list&quot;being used to provide candidates to take up any additional seats on the basisof total votes cast in the region. ......The main variants in the list systems are -a. size and number of constituenciesb. nomination requirementsc. form of ballot paper      . &apos;- .-d. .- method of votinge. method of counting votes   .f. threshhold provisions for allocation of seats7.   For United Kingdom elections to-the European Assembly, it would-be possible&quot;to have separate lists for Scotland, Wales and,Northern Ireland and, if desiredfor the different regions of England.   A.list system using only party labelswould require the establishment of-some procedure (which does not at presentexist) for the registration of political parties.   A list system covering thewhole of the United Kingdom as one constituency and not using party:labelswould involve a very long ballot, paper with perhaps 300 names.3
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS --Northern Ireland8.   The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was asked to explore the praticability of devising an electoral system which Would permit a &quot;represent&quot;of the minority community to be elected there.   He has proposed that northern Ireland should constitute a single constituency returning its three members by the single transferable vote system of proportional representation.Even if some other system were decided upon for Great Britain there would not seem to be any reason why PR(STV) which has already been used inNorthern Ireland should not be the system used also for the European Assemblyelection in the province (although this would mean a lack of uniformitythroughout the United Kingdom).Boundary Commissions9*   Any system based on single member constituencies would present problems oboundary-drawing for which Boundary Commission procedures would be desirableOther systems operate in larger, multi-member constituencies (eg Scotland,Uales, Northern Ireland, the English regions) which could perhaps be definedadministratively without recourse to the Boundary Commissions, although there might be arguments for using, a Boundary Commission procedure, especially 11of the constituencies were comparatively small, or if the boundaries were likely to be controversial, because for example they crucially affected thenumber of seats to be allotted to a constituency.Dial Mandate10.   The Decision of 20 September 1976 (Crand 6623) does not require candidates for election to the European Assembly to be members of national Parliaments.The Governments Green Paper on Direct Elections, published in February 1970rsaid that the Government favoured&apos;the optional dual mandate-&quot;(paragraph 23 0Cmnd 6399)o   The Select Committee on Direct Elections also recommended(paragraph 19 of the First Report) in favour of the optional dual mandate.
11*   The optional dual mandate presents no practical problems.    It simply means that no Member of Parliament is denied the right to stand for election to theEuropean Assembly.   The compulsory dual mandate would mean that onlff Membersof the House of Commons could be clouted to the European Assembly.   This would raise problems of various kinds.   If a European Election happened to coincide with a General Election some problems of eligibility for the former would arise;someone standing for the Assembly could be elected but simultaneouslydisqualified because he or she did not win a seat in the House of Commons; itcould necessitate provision for electing alternative choices for the Assembly.If elections were not simultaneous (and periods of membership of equal length)cases would arise of Assembly members losing their qualification for membership.Although the compulsory dual mandate could provide an effective link betweenthe.European Assembly members and Members of Parliament, it would impose a heavy burden of work and travel on the constituency Member   of Parliament whois also a European Assembly member.    It could also increase the difficultiesof the Government business managers in the passage of legislation through parliament if up to 81 Members of Parliament were absent at the european assembly at one time.18 February 19775
