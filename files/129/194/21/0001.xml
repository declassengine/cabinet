toENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77)21 COPY NO      gQ18 February 1977CABINETTHE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE EXERCISE 1977 -ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. In the next few weeks we will have to consider guidelines for puttingin hand the 1977 Public Expenditure exercise.    As background for this Ienclose a note by the Treasury on the economic prospects.    I agree broadlywith this analysis, and should like to indicate the implications, as I see them,for our expenditure strategy.2. Something over a year ago, in the White Paper Cmnd. 6393, we setout our strategy on public expenditure until the end of the decade.    Underthis plan the total of expenditure programmes was to level off after 1976-77at broadly the level then projected for that year.     This had become necessary because expenditure had risen steeply over a period of years inwhich our economic growth had been sluggish or stagnant, and in which ourreal disposable national income had actually decreased because of the risein commodity prices generally and the quadrupling of the oil price.3. Even then we could finance the resulting expenditure total only byhigh tax rates on ordinary working people coupled with a large borrowing requirement.    Financially this was a precarious course, but I hoped to avoid further cuts in planned expenditure, especially while unemployment remainedhigh.    In the event the problems of financing our domestic budget deficit andour external balance of payments deficit required us to make further adjust-ments in spending plans for 1977-78 and 1978-79.    As a result, totalspending on government programmes in those years is not merely to beievelled off but actually to fall a littU.    The resulting improvement in our financial prospects, the successful outcome of our negotiations with theinternational Monetary Fund and the creditor countries, together with the increasingly tangible benefits of North Sea oil, have enabled us to surmountthe crisis of confidence which had developed in the latter part of 1976.4* For practical purposes our total spending levels are now determined^ot only for the coming financial year but also for 1978-79, though our provisional programmes for the latter year have etili to be replaced by firm decisions.    But, in rolling our spending plans forward, we will have tosettle provisional programmes for 1979-80, and at the same time we oughtto take stock of our public expenditure strategy for the medium term.1
5. I do not think that there can be any question of allowing government expenditure after 1978-79 once again to start taking up an increasing proportion of our national resources.    In other words, we cannot allowit to grow faster than the economy as a whole.    That would simply revivethe financing problems and the imbalance in the economy which we havebeen making such great efforts to put right.    Nevertheless, short of that,we should still have a number of options in the allocation of the growth of resources which we hope to see in the 1980s.6. Clearly we must give a very high priority to achieving and maintain-ing a substantial surplus in our balance of payments current account, 60 asto pay off our overseas debts, replenish our reserves and remove the riskof running into deficit again.     That is the only basis on which we can achievereal independence in our economic policies.    To bring this about, and sosecure the basis for a renewed and lasting growth in employment, we mustsee that resources are available for industrial investment and a continuingincrease in net exports.    North Sea oil by itself will not reverse the declinein our industrial performance;  the benefits arising from it could even havethe opposite result if we do not use them to good purpose.7. Nevertheless, provided that we carry through the required adjustment in the next couple of years and achieve our objectives on the balance ofpayments, the analysis in the Treasury paper suggests that, in the early1980s, there could well be resources available for some relaxation in fiscalausterity.    This does not mean that there would be scope for an extravagantconsumption boom in an attempt to spend our way back to full employment;but there should be scope for some reduction in real taxation, or somemoderate year-by-year increase in public expenditure, or some reasonablecombination of the two, which would help to relieve unemployment.8. I regard it as a matter of high priority to secure a continuingreduction in real taxation, so as to increase real take-home pay without increasing the wage costs of our goods and services.    This will at the sametime take the pressure off the exchange rate and lower inflation.    For these reasons this tax objective is an essential ingredient in our economic andindustrial strategy.9. We are in any case committed to phasing in the full child benefitscheme over the next couple of years.    We are treating this as financedout of the withdrawal of child tax allowances and not involving a claim onthe contingency reserve.    Nevertheless, it does add to the gross total of social security payments at the expense of take-home pay.    We must bearthis in mind in our future decisions affecting expenditure on the one handand taxation on the other.10.       At the same time we should be able to think in terms of a moderategrowth in the total of central and local government expenditure in the early1980s, provided that it is within the sustainable growth in our resources.The uncertainty and margin of error in any medium term projections,especially when so much depends on the international environment, make itunwise to put figures now on the rate of growth of government expenditure
which will be sustainable over a long period of years ahead.    Nor do we need to do so.    We will have to continue the process of taking firmprogramme decisions for one year ahead, and settling provisionalProgrammes for a further year beyond that.    But, though there are someprogrammes or projects which require longer term planning than that, oneof the main purposes of framing medium term projections for public expenditure is to avoid over-committing ourselves.U.       it will be important both for practical planning purposes and forconfidence at home and abroad that we should not make the old mistake ofcommitting ourselves to ambitious forward programmes before we are quite sure that the resources are available for them.    If we can convinceindustry that we are set for a period of sustainable growth, without theprospect of periodical cutbacks because of the balance of payments (and thebenefits of the North Sea, if sensibly used, can enable us to break out of thatpattern,) that will be an important ingredient in getting the change ofattitudes which we need for increased investment and more effective industrialPerformance.    I suggest, therefore, that we should provisionally think interms of an increase in general government expenditure in the early 1980sat an arbitrary overall rate of, say, 2 per cent a year, on the basis that wevvill be prepared to adjust this in the light of developments as we roll our expenditure programmes forward each year.    Within the total, the changesin individual programmes approved from year to year would depend on ourchoice of priorities.!2.       But 1979-80 itself is likely to be an awkward transitional year.    Wenave to decide to what extent the cuts made in the years before then shouldbe carried through into 1979-80.    If we simply reverted to the originalCmnd 6393 plans for that year, as up-dated in the 1976 Survey, that in itself would produce a sharp jump in our spending between 1978-79 and 1979-80.13.       The general run of programmes, in conjunction with provision for areasonable contingency reserve, would result in an increase higher thanthe possible trend rate of growth in expenditure which I have discussed above.*n addition, the projections of government lending to the nationalised industries which emerged from the last Survey indicated an exceptionallylarge jump in this particular programme in 1979-80.l4.       When added to the increase in the rest of public expenditure whichWould result if we simply took the updated Cmnd 6393 programmes withoutany adjustment, this would result in a total increase from one year toanother quite out of line with our medium term strategy, which would poseserious problems for the management and financing of public expenditure.1 am sure that we must aim to smooth out such an abrupt jump in aParticular year, and that with sensible adjustments to the various programmes*bi8 can be done.3

CONCLUSIONS15.       I propose therefore that our approach to the 1977 Survey should bebased on keeping total public expenditure in 1978-79 within the level justpublished in our latest White Paper (Crrnd 6721);  and that for the following years we should adopt the longer term approach which I have set out inparagraphs 10 and 11 of this paper.    In applying this approach to 1979-80,it will be necessary to scrutinise programmes so as to get better phasing and keep in line with the proposed longer-term growth rate; particular attention will have to be paid to the special problem of the nationalised industries.16,       This approach would enable us to avoid over-committing ourselves in advance, while still planning ahead for some resumed growth in expenditure programmes after 1978-79, provided that we achieve our immediate objectives on the balance of payments and in the fight against inflation.    In rolling programmes forward each year, if we found that thedevelopment of the economy gave more scope for a fiscal stimulus, it wouldbe my intention to take every advantage of this when the time came so as todo still more to help employment.17,       If Cabinet agree, following the usual interdepartmental consultationI will circulate draft guidelines on this basis for approval in the next coupleof weeks, so that the Survey can be put in hand.    The object will be toconsider the results of the Survey early in July and to take as many aspossible of the essential decisions at that stage.D W treasury Chambers18 February 1977
ANNEX1977 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY:    THE ECONOMIC background the 1977 Public Expenditure Survey will need to do two thingsFirst, to replace the existing provisional programme decisions for1978-79 by firm decisions which will provide the basis forEstimates and cash limits.     Second, to take provisional decisions on programmes for 1979-80, and to take a preliminary look beyond that so that decisions on the first two years are related to atoediuni term outlook.2.     The 1976 Survey was based on keeping within the plan in theWhite Paper published a year ago (Cmnd. 6393), but it was also necessary to scale down the programmes for 1977-78 and 1978-79 inorder to reduce the financing requirement.     These changes wereincorporated in the White Paper published in January (Cmnd.6721-1)No decisions were however taken at that time on the extent towhich analogous changes should be made to the figures for 1979-80and 1980-81;    nor do the figures for 1978-79 take account of thefurther fiscal adjustment mentioned in the Chancellor&apos;s statementQf 15 December.3.     This paper provides an appraisal of the economic backgroundas a basis for a preliminary discussion by Cabinet.    In thelight of that discussion, two further papers are to be brought forward - a joint Treasury/CPRS paper on expenditure priorities,and draft guidelines on the way in which officials should prepare the 1977 Survey report.4.     1976 was a difficult year.    The sluggishness of the world&apos;sRecovery from recession halted the progress that had been madein reducing the external deficit.    The problems of financing itand the public sector borrowing requirement (PS3R) at home becameDiore acute as the year went on and were reflected in the fallingexchange rate and sharp rises in interest rates.     Confidencewas badly shaken.    Following the agreement with the international monetary Fund in December the immediate situation in the financialmarkets has improved strongly.   But the basic problems remain -notably those of bringing down the rate of inflation and of achieving both a high level of employment and a strong balance ofPayments.
SECRETEconomic Prospects to 1978-795.     The forecast growth of the economy underlying the expendituretotals and PSBR objectives for the next two financial years were that gross domestic product would increase by about 2% in 1977-78and by 2-^-3% in the following year.     These forecasts were given inthe Letter of Intent to the IMP, which also said that, incarrying out the 1977 expenditure Survey and the subsequentBudget, the Government would continue to be guided by the need toshift resources into exports and investment and that, if the forecast growth of the economy from the beginning of 1978 to theend of 1979 exceeds 3 %, an additional fiscal adjustment would bemade in the 1978 Budget of  - -1 billion at 1976 prices.    It was left for decision nearer the time whether such a contingentadjustment, and the fiscal adjustment of  0.5 billion to which weare committed in 1978-79, should take the form of expenditure cuts or tax increases.6.     The pattern of expected demand over these next two years is strongly orientated towards exports, manufacturing investment andthe rebuilding of stocks.   Public authorities1 consumption and private consumption both remain flat.   The proportion of public expenditure to GDP (at market prices) should fall from its peak ofabout 46 per cent in 1975-76 to 42-4-3 per cent in 1978-79 and thePSBR be reduced to about 5  Per cent of GDP.    These reductions should ease the problem of controlling money supply and DCE whileensuring that adequate funds are available for industry atacceptable interest rates.7.     The allocation of resources is thus changing in the desireddirection and - with the increasing flow of oil from the north sea - the external current account is forecast to swing from a deficit of  1.5 billion in 1976 to a surplus of about the same order in 1978.     To see this level of surplus - and the task thatstill lies ahead - in perspective, however, it is important to remember that it is offset to the extent of around  1 billion ayear by lending for export credit and other &quot;structural&quot; capitaloutflows and it is achieved against the background of high unemployment.
8.     The Government are in a highly constrained situation forprobably the next two years in managing the economy so as to getunemployment down.     Its declared objectives of getting thebalance of payments right, bringing the rate of inflation down toan acceptable level, and improving the country&apos;s industrialperformance are pre-conditions for a return to full employment.Later Years9.     Looking to the years beyond 1978-79, the constraints shouldhe less, and faster growth should be possible.    This, however,will depend critically upon the trend of the world economy andon the progress of our own efforts in carrying through the adjustments of the economy on which we are now engaged.10.   Projections from past experience are of little relevance sinceby 1Q80 we are likely to be in a situation without past precedent.x Provided we manage our affairs prudently, North Sea oil shouldhave brought about a major improvement in our external balance,and by so doing should create confidence that the economy can be run for several years to come without the crises and deflationaryPackages that have inhibited industrial enterprise and investmentI over the past twenty years.    But the contribution of North Sea oilshould not be exaggerated.     It does not itself provide muchadditional employment, and even with its help the balance ofPayments would not be strong enough to permit us to get back to full employment simply by expanding domestic demand.    On present estimates North Sea oil would add about       to the annual rise inthe economy&apos;s productive potential between now and the early 1980s,and would account in 1980 for about 4 per cent of gross domestic product.    This is a welcome addition to our national resources,but it is not an enormous one;    and, of course, it is not of .indefinite duration.
11.   It is therefore vital to use the benefits of the North Sea inways that produce a long-term strengthening of the economy.Specifically, this means:(a) achieving a major improvement in our externalreserves/debt position, and so making ourselvesless vulnerable to shocks from the outside world.(b) Expanding and strengthening the industrialbase of the economy.(c) Developing new sources of energy to fill the gap that will emerge as our own oil suppliesrun out.0f these prior claims, only the first can be quantified withprecision.12.    On the basis of our borrowings to date we have official debt^payments amounting to between  1.5 billions and nearly  4 billionsin each of the years from 1979 to 1982.     In addition we need tofcake provision for building up the reserves from their recentdangerously low levels and for some running down of sterling balances.    Allowing for this, for oil company repayments of loanstaken to finance the initial development of the North Sea and foroutflows of capital associated with export credit and reinvestedProfits overseas, we will need to aim at a current account^rplus in the early 1980s of the order of 2 % of GDP.     In money terms, this implies a surplus of  5-6 billion a year.    This means that over the next three or four years most of the additional resources accruing from North Sea oil will be needed to strengthent^-e external position.13.    This strengthening requires, however, that in managing the economy the emphasis must be not on achieving the quickest expansionof demand that available domestic resources will permit, but onSetting the economy on to a growth path that can be sustained.In the past the sustainable growth rate for GDP appears toWe been not more than 2*-3 Per cent a year.     Attempts to expandeconomy faster - as in 1959-61, 1962-64 or 1971-75 - brought
supply constraints and &quot;balance of payments deficits and theexpansion had to be abruptly reined back..   Indeed, the average annual growth of GDP over the twenty years from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s was 2-g- per cent.    Since this was below the growth of the economy&apos;s productive potential there was an upward trend in umemployment, with more unemployment at the trough in eachsuccessive cycle.    Success of the stabilization programme over thenext two years should, with the help of North Sea oil, make possible a major improvement in the economy&apos;s growth performancein the 1980s.15.    It is impossible to say here and now what that growth rate would be.     Firstly, we do not know what effect the disturbancesof recent years - the oil price rise, the pay explosion of 197^-75*the profits squeeze, the high nominal interest rates and the relatively low levels of investment in industry - have had onthe usefulness of existing capacity and the extent of netadditions to capital stock.     There are some grounds for thinking that effective capacity may have been reduced.   Unless there is substantial investment in new capacity in certain sectors wecould by 1980 again be running into the sort of supply constraintsthat have brought earlier expansions to an abrupt halt.    It remains&quot;to be seen how quickly the industrial strategy can make good theseshortcomings.    Secondly, even with North Sea oil an attempt to force the pace of expansion would almost certainly land us back in&quot;balance of payments trouble.    Although our prices and costs are more competitive than at any time since (at least) the 1967devaluation, we start from a position in which the balance ofPayments would be in very deep deficit (that is, much worse thanthe existing deficit) if demand were at full employment level.Any substantial reflation of home demand could quickly erode thesurplus we now foresee.    The growth of the economy must therefore to a considerable extent be export-led, and is not independent ofthe pace at which the rest of the world is growing.
Public Expenditure and Available Resources16.    These considerations are likely to set rather close limits tothe pace of expansion for some time to come.    The present problemof unemployment in the industrial countries generally reflects the conflict between a set of strongly inflationary forces, onthe one hand, and,on the other ,the determination of governments to operate fiscal and monetary policies which they see as designedto resist inflation.    It may also reflect in some degree&apos;structural factors1 such as changes in demand patterns caused bythe oil price increase and in relative costs.    In many countries the problem is further increased by the growth of the labour force - which in the United Kingdom is expected to rise more than500,000 over the next five years.    While, therefore, an expansionof demand will be an essential part of the strategy for returning to full employment, it cannot in itself provide a complete answer.So far at least as the United Kingdom is concerned the successful prosecution of policies to improve industry&apos;s efficiency and holddown its costs are essential conditions of any considerable\  expansion of demand by deliberate policy.17.    The problem of unemployment has to be tackled at severallevels.    International co-operation, both world-wide and within the eec, to expand world trade is one key element.   Pay policy andthe industrial strategy are others.    The return to full employment is likely to depend as much on improvements on the supply sideof the economy as on the pace of expansion of aggregate demand.18.    The margin of resources available in the early 1980s for private and public consumption will be governed not only by the pace at which output grows but also by the course of the terms oftrade, since this will determine what volume of real resourcesneeds to be switched into the balance of payments to achieve the required surplus.    The dramatic worsening of the terms of trade inI973-74 was the cause of many of our later difficulties.    Thoughthe behaviour of commodity prices in the aftermath    of the recentrecession is a little disquieting, there is no evident reason forexpecting another shift in the terms of trade between manufacturesand primary products of dramatic kind that occurred in 1973/74.
February, 197718th Treasury^ the UK&apos;s non-oil terms of trade remain broadly unchanged from now on, our overall terms of trade should improve a little asWe become independent of imported oil.    This improvement should so some way towards making good the sharp reduction in thenation&apos;s real disposable income we suffered in 1974-.   Eor the rest,aftd for rising living standards, we must look to improvedProductivity.^ iyate and Public Consumption^9.   Provided the necessary adjustments of the economy are achievedln the next two years, it should be possible to sustain in the 1980sa growth rate that is rather higher than the 2-^-3 per cent that hasbeen the limit in the past, and if we succeed in improving industrialPerformance the growth rate could be quite significantly higher,^he volume of resources available for public and private consumption,taken together, should be able to grow at a broadly similar rate to GDP (assuming no dramatic change in the terms of trade).0*    The division of those resources between public and privateConi;umption will need to take account of the implications for realtake-home pay and for the level and structure of taxes.   After aiQrig period in which personal consumption has been severely heldhack - on current forecasts it would be no higher in 1978 than in;&quot;^?3, while public authorities1 consumption would be,at a provisional estimate 11 per cent higher - there is a strong case for^ reliefs.    This is reinforced by the need to remedy thedistort ions of the tax system brought about by inflation.   On thisVlew tax reliefs would be essential to the policies for improving the economy&apos;s performance - both by helping to restrain pay inElation to productivity and by restoring incentives.   Some growth0^ Public expenditure should nevertheless be possible, whileeeping the public sector deficit within limits that would not^Pose financing problems.
