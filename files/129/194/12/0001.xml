SOCIAL SECURITY AND HEALTH PROGRAMMES:     INCREASES  IN PUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chief Secretary to tho treasury in his paper CC(77)11 the Secretary of State for Social Servicesconcludes that he can only offer  1- 1.5 million savings in 1977-78 onthe health and personal social services programme (total expendituresome  6.5 billion in 1977-78) to offset the loss of savings ( 20 million)from the abandonment of the Road Traffic Casualties Bill.    He proposesr]o savings towards the loss of  40 million revenue in subsequent years&apos;&quot;hich the Cabinet decided last autumn should also be used to reducethe public expenditure totals.2.    It is important to consider the above losses of savings together&apos;&quot;ith the actual and potential losses from the recent defeats in committee on the Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.   All^ese must be offset if we are to avoid a serious risk of failing tol!5plement the decisions announced in the Public Expenditure white Paperafid incorporated in the Letter of Intent to the IMF.    The contingency reserve is already substantially below the comparable figure in last?ear&apos;s White Paper.5*    The losses are summarised in the following table:Survey Prices)1978-7912.01.040.0   -53.012.011.076.0Losses of Savings (  million.    19761977-78fa)  Actual(i) Unemployment benefit foroccupational pensioners 9.0(ii) Supplementary benefit for students 1.0(iii) Abandonment of Road TrafficCasualties Bill 20.030.0&quot;0  Potential(i) Unemployment benefit for^^students 12.0(ii) Supplementary benefit for^^students &apos; 11.0Possible grand total 53-0l
Notes- (l) Possible loss if Government cannot carry throughHouse regulations to exclude students from UB in short vacations.(2) Possible loss if Supplementary Benefit Commissioncannot maintain present discretionary practice of taking into account full amount of student grant-plus parental contribution in assessing SBentitlement.4. Against this the Secretary of State has offered the followingsavings :-  mi Hi.on.    1976 Survey Prices1977-78       1978-79(i) PIS uprating 2.0 2.0(ii) Accelerated phasing outof CTAs for non-residentchildren (saving on net-Exchequer cost of childbenefit) 4.0(iii) Health programme -entrally financed services 1.0-1.5Total 3.0-3.5 6.05.     The social security and health programmes have been largelyUntouched by our recent public expenditure cuts.    I believe it ispossible to find larger savings while still maintaining the high priority of these programmes.    On social security, postponement of the19?7 PIS uprating to November would save a further  3 million, and asnort deferment of the introduction of the non-contributory invalidity pension for married women from November this year until April 1978would save another  7 million in 1977-78.    Some adjustment in theon-going mobility allowance arrangements would also ndd to the savings.&quot;One of these measures requires Parliamentary approval and the Ministerfor Social Security made it clear in the course of the Social Securityriill that rejection of-the Government&apos;s own proposals would mean morePainful economies elsewhere.On the health programme, there is a strong case on merits for an^crease in prescription charges which, through the extensive system0I&quot; exemptions, would not affect the poor, chronically ill or othertieedy categories.    An increase to ;100 would broadly make good the2
losses on the  Road Casualties Bill.    But  if the  Cabinet cannosupport  this,   I believe  it  is possible,   with total national health Service  expenditure  of over  5 billion  a year,   to makefurthur savings at the margin on the health programme thatwould not  seriously affect present standards of service    and health care.     For example,  even a half per cent reduction incurrent expenditure on hospitals and community health service1977-78 could  save nearly  20 million;     and on the capitalside there  could be  savings on minor projects.3
