The Governmenfs Expenditure Plans Volume IIPart 2: The Individual Programme^)Introduction to second volume1. This volume of the White Paper describes the individual public expenditure programmes which were summarised in Part 1, and contains othersupporting analyses. The supporting material includes a description of nationalised industry investment programmes, and of the way in which thisinvestment is financed from internal and other sources.2. As has already been explained in Part 1, the annual survey for 1976was completed and some adjustments were made to programmes in orderto keep within the overall Cmnd 6393 plan, as modified by the measures announced on 22 July. Subsequently, further changes were announced on15 December affecting expenditure programmes in both 1977-78 and1978-79. The tables for the individual programmes show the revisedprogrammes for 1977-78 and 1978-79, taking account of all the changes made to these programmes since Cmnd 6393. The figures for 1978-79will be reviewed in the 1977 survey.3. For 1979-80 and 1980-81, the figures in the programme tables arethose which emerged from the 1976 survey. Figures for the later survey years are in any case increasingly provisional, but on this occasion those for thetwo final years are particularly so in that they do not take account of the developments which led to the Chancellor of the Exchequers statement on15 December. The extent of any consequential adjustment to total public expenditure in the two final years has still to be considered; and its implications-tions for individual programmes in those years have not therefore been worked out. The figures for 1979-80 and 1980-81, which are shown in italictype in the programme tables, will thus need to be reappraised in the nextannual survey. In the meantime these figures have, so far as possible, been included in the tables to indicate the position which had been reachedwhen the 1976 survey had been completed, and which will provide the starting point for the 1977 survey. In a few instances, where the programmefigures for 1979-80 and 1980-81 most clearly require reconsideration follow-ing the decisions affecting those programmes announced on 15 December,no figures are shown for those years. These cases are identified with a t inthe tables. In addition, no projections for those two years are being givenin this White Paper for government lending to nationalised industries, debt interest and the contingency reserve.(&apos;)A11 the figures in the programme tables have been rounded to the nearest  1 million, nnd do not therefore necessarily sum to the totals. As in previous white papers, the corresponding figures from Cmnd 6393 have been revalued to 1976survey prices for purposes of comparison (see glossary on page 147 for definition ofthese terms).

The Government^ defence policy objectives will be fully described inthe 1977 Statement on the Defence Estimates. The Defence Budget iscentral government expenditure, nearly all of it on goods and services. it includes not only spending by the Ministry of Defence but also that by theProperty Services Agency on works for defence. It is net of various receipts,among those itemised in Defence Estimates, which at survey prices total some 520 million in the current year and it includes provision for the costs ofpeacekeeping in Northern Ireland. 94 per cent of Defence Budget expenditure is cash limited.2.   The Defence Budget figures for 1977-78 and 1978-79 in the table

As explained in the Intro-duction, beyond 1978-79 the figures, like those for other programmes, areprovisional. The provision for 1980-81 will be determined in the light also of developments in the planned defence programme; at this stage therefore the figure for 1980-81 repeats that for 1979-80.National accounts adjustments3. The national accounts adjustments figures reflect a decision to exclude part of the Royal Ordnance Factories&apos; capital expenditure financed by pre-payments from overseas customers.i- :        if....

(i) Aid programme (line (a)) includes advances from the Exchequer to the commonwealth development Corporation (CDC) net of repayments: the total (line (c)) incorporates trie netflows of funds from the CDC to overseas countries. The adjustment (line (*)) represents tnedifference between the two figures.1. This programme includes contributions to the European economic community. Nearly all the programme is the responsibility of centralgovernment. About one quarter is spent on goods and services. The aid programme is cash limited, and so is the greater part of the other overseas services apart from e.c. contributions.Overseas aid2. This programme covers the United Kingdom&apos;s official bilateral andmultilateral assistance to the developing countries.3. The figures in table 2.2 show, despite reductions of  50 million in1977-78 and  55 million in 1978-79 from the previously planned levelsfor those years, a small growth between 1976-77 and 1978-79 of 1.6 percent.4. The Government has accepted in principle the United Nationsaid target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) for officialdevelopment assistance, but without commitment as to the date by whichthis may be capable of being reached. In 1975 United Kingdom officialdevelopment assistance represented 0.37 per cent of GNP.

The allocation of the aid programme is reviewed annually. In1977-78 it is planned that roughly half the allocation will go to bilateralcapital aid, a quarter through multilateral institutions, and a little lessthan a fifth in technical cooperation. The remainder will be spent throughthe Commonwealth Development Corporation and on payment of pensions to British citizens who have worked for the Governments of developing countries.6. In addition to the aid programme allocations set out in table2.2, the amount received in repayments of principal from earlier loans is re-cycled each year. The amounts vary from  44 million in 1976-77to an anticipated  57 million in 1978-79, but as a result of our policy to give aid wholly on grant terms to the poorest countries this rate of increase will not be maintained in later years.7. Detailed statistical information for the past five years is given inthe HMSO publication &quot;British Aid Statistics&quot; and an account of theBritish Aid Programme as provided to the Organisation for economic co-operation and Developments Development Assistance Committee is published as a White Paper each year. The last such White Paper wasCmnd 6544, published in 1976.
Overseas aid administration8. This covers administrative expenses of the Ministry of overseas development (ODM). In addition to the headquarters in London, the ODMmaintains five Development Divisions overseas: in the Caribbean (Bridge-town), Middle East (temporarily in Amman), South East Asia (Bangkok),East Africa (Nairobi) and Southern Africa (Blantyre). The cost coversstaff, accommodation and official travel both at home and overseas.Overseas representation9. This expenditure covers the cost of the Foreign and commonwealth office (FCO) in London, British diplomatic and consular representation(at present in 151 countries) and 8 official delegations to international organis-ations and conferences. It covers the cost of staff (excluding those engaged on information work) as well as their office and private accommodationabroad and official travel. It also includes the cost of the Passport offices in London and other centres and the communications organisation support-ing the Diplomatic Service.10. Expenditure by the Property Services Agency (PSA) on the Diplo-matic Estate overseas accounts for about 22 per cent of this programme.11. The responsibility of the Diplomatic Service for representing and promoting British interests abroad includes the handling of inter-governmentalrelations; advice on foreign policy; protecting the interests of British nationalsabroad; promoting Britain&apos;s visible and invisible exports by assistingBritish commercial organisations and firms, and by conducting bilateraland multilateral negotiations on international trade and payments; over-seas administration of aid and immigration policies; and representing her majesty&apos;s Government in international organisations.12. The expenditure figures for 1978-79 onwards are provisional pro-objections. Account has been taken of cuts of  2 million in diplomatic service manpower expenditure. Of the remainder of the  10 million civilservice staff cuts announced in the Chancellor of the Exchequers statementof 15 December, the larger part is attributable to further savings to be madeby the FCO. The precise size and timing of the savings is subject to ministerial decisions to be taken in the light of the review of overseas representation by the Central Policy Review Staff, which was announced on14 January 1976, and which is due to be completed soon.Overseas information13. This programme covers three main elements:a. The cost of the BBC external services. These broadcast in english and 38 other languages for over 700 hours a weekO toinform the largest possible foreign audiences about Britain and her role in international affairs. They supply pre-recorded pro-grammes to overseas broadcasting stations. The expenditure also(l)See BBC Handbook 1977.
covers operating expenses such as programme staff and engineer-ing costs, and capital expenditure on relay stations and on the modernisation of the headquarters at Bush House. Much of thecost of the BBC monitoring service is also included under this heading.b. The FCO share of British Council expenditure^) to promote widerknowledge of the United Kingdom and the English languageabroad, and to foster cultural relations with other countries. TheCouncil is at present represented in 80 countries overseas.c. The cost of FCO information staff at home and abroad andtheir operational expenses; the cost of supporting services providedby the Central Office of Information and the Stationery Office, and part of external broadcasting relay expenditure. The aim is toensure an awareness of Britain&apos;s international role and interests by personal contact, the provision of material in all media and a programme of visits to the United Kingdom, and to secure an understanding of and support for the policies of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, as well as achieving a favourable environment forthe promotion of the interests of British business.14. Since the publication of Cmnd 6393 the overseas information pro-gramme for 1977-78 has been cut by  2 million. From 1978-79 onwards,the expenditure figures are provisional projections and take no accountof decisions to be taken as a result of the Central Policy Review Staffsreview of overseas representation.Other external relations15. The main items of expenditure are certain overseas service pensionsand various international commitments and subscriptions. These includepayments under a Treasury guarantee to the International Bank for Recon-struction and Development (because of default by the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia); the United Kingdom&apos;s assessed contributions to theregular budgets of United Nations organisations and of the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Council of Europe andthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Secretariat costs); and a grant-in-aid to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Provision has beenmade for the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution to the United Nations EmergencyForce in the Middle East in 1977-78.Military aid16. This programme consists mainly of courses in the United kingdom for overseas service personnel, and to a lesser extent the loan of british service personnel to a few developing countries for training purposes. Withthe exception of some new unavoidable commitments, for which provision has been made in 1977-78, annual expenditure under this heading has beenconstantly decreasing since 1971-72. The figures in table 2.2 above are netC1) See British Council Annual Reports.
of repayments of earlier capital aid loans of i,\ million in recent years and 1 million from 1978-79 onwards.Contributions to the European Communities, etc (net)17. The figures in table 2.2 are made up of two elements. First, theUnited Kingdom&apos;s payments to the budget of the European Communities,net of receipts from the budget and excluding the United Kingdom share ofexpenditure programmes which are included in other functional programmes;second, contributions to the capital and reserves of the European InvestmentBank. The totals of the United Kingdom&apos;s payments to the community budget are set out in the tables in paragraph 20 below.18. The United Kingdom contributes to the Community budget underthe own resources system, modified during the transitional period by theterms of the Treaty of Accession. This provides that the United Kingdom&apos;contribution should rise in steps from 8.78 per cent of the 1973 budget to19.24 per cent of the 1977 budget. Under the provisions of Article 131(la)of the Treaty of Accession, the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution to the 1978and 1979 budgets will depend in part on the amount of own resourcescollected in the United Kingdom in 1977. The United Kingdom&apos;s contribu-tion to the 1980, and subsequent, budgets will be on the basis of the fullown resources system. For the purposes of these forecasts it has been assumed that the United Kingdom&apos;s share of the budgets for 1978 to 1981will be of the order of 22 to 27 per cent.19. Following the conventions used elsewhere in this White Paper, theestimates take account only of expenditure on policies previously agreed atthe time when the figures were finalised, no allowance in general beingmade for policies still under discussion in the Council of Ministers. they also assume continued payments from the budget at the then current (October1976) rate on United Kingdom food imports from the e.c. member statesand, in certain cases, from non-member countries, under the system of monetary compensatory amounts. Since mid-1976, most of these paymentshave been made in other member states instead of the United Kingdom; thisreduces United Kingdom receipts from the budget without diminishing thebenefits the United Kingdom derives from the arrangement. The revisedtreatment of monetary compensatory amounts, together with the increasedamounts for them due to the fall in the value of sterling against the otherCommunity currencies, largely accounts for the increase in the UnitedKingdom&apos;s net contribution to the Community Budget since Cmnd 6393. Theestimates are based on the present budgetary arrangements, including theFinancial Mechanism, and use the present unit of account conversion rates;for the budget unit of account  1 equals 2.4 units of account.20. The latest estimates for the calendar years to 1981 for the UnitedKingdom&apos;s contributions to, and receipts from, the Community budget are

The budget of the European Communities provides the finance forthe four Community institutions, the Council of Ministers, the Court ofJustice, the Commission and the European Assembly. The main Communitypolicies (eg the Common Agricultural Policy, the Social Fund, the regional development Fund, aid, research) are financed from the Commission^section of the budget, which accounts for some 98 per cent of the totalCommunity budget; the budgets of the other institutions are almost entirelyfor their administrative and running expenses.

Receipts from this source are included in table 2.2: Overseas aid and other overseas services.1. The general pattern of expenditure on the agricultural part of this programme in recent years reflects the transition to the system of agricultural support and market regulation under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)of the European Communities. The transitional period terminates at the endof 1977 and with the exception of wool, which is outside the scope of the cap, and sheep and potatoes, for which Common Market regimes have notbeen agreed, the arrangements for the main agricultural commodities and grants will then be fully subject to Community rules. (Expenditure inNorthern Ireland on price guarantees for sheep and potatoes, on productionand capital support measures, and on support in special areas is includedin programme 15, Northern Ireland.) Nearly all expenditure on this programme is by central government, and subsidies account for about four-fifths of it in 1976-77 although this proportion declines significantly there-after with the phasing out of food subsidies. With the exception ofagricultural support and animal health expenditure the bulk of the pro-gramme is cash limited. The forecasts for 1979-80 and 1980-81 are pro-visional, being based on a projection of expenditure in earlier years.Market regulation under the CAP2.

The UK price guarantees for all CAP products except milk havealready terminated, and the guarantee for milk expires at the end of 1977.Expenditure on implementing the milk guarantee is regarded as a consumersubsidy and is accordingly included in table 2.3 under &quot;Food subsidies&quot;.4. For price guarantees on products not covered by Common Marketregimes sheep, wool and potatoes the figures are conventional, being based on a projection of the estimated expenditure in the current year, andreflect the decisions made following the 1976 Annual Review (Cmnd 6392).Any changes in guaranteed prices following the 1977 Review could affectthe projections.Production grants and subsidies, capital grants and support in special areas5. The forecasts allow for the decisions announced after the 1976 annual review to improve the capital grants, to end the beef cow subsidy after 1977and the calf subsidy for calves born after April 1977, and to increase the rateof compensatory allowances for hill cows. They also allow for the generalsavings in public expenditure in 1977-78, announced by the Chancellor of
the Exchequer on 22 July 1976, which include a 3 months deferral of capitalgrant payments, termination of the lime subsidy from 30 September 1976,changes in the farm structure schemes and re-timing of the payment of com-pensatory allowances for hill livestock. Some unavoidable delay in payments of these compensatory allowances in 1975-76 resulted in a carry-over ofexpenditure into 1976-77.6. The figures for production grants and subsidies and for support in special areas take account of the extent to which grants and subsidies, at fixedrates, lose their value as prices rise. Any restoration or improvement of thatvalue at subsequent Annual Reviews, including the 1977 Review, may need to be considered as a claim against the contingency reserve.Relationship of agricultural expenditure to policy objectives7. The White Paper &quot;Food from our own Resources&quot; (Cmnd 6020,April 1975) sets out the Governments medium term agricultural objectives and priorities. That assessment justifies the policy of expansion of food pro-duction and projects average growth of agricultural net product, from 1975to the early 1980s, at about 2\ per cent a year.8. Unfavourable weather in 1975 and the severe drought in the springand summer of 1976 have reduced the net product, but given normal weatherthe next harvest should show a substantial recovery. The economic condition and prospects of agriculture in the United Kingdom are reviewed each yearand the conclusions of the 1977 Review were published in the &quot;annual review of Agriculture&quot; (Cmnd 6703), where a great deal of supportinginformation about the industry is provided. This information, which relatesmainly to the most recent 5 years, provides a detailed analysis of the current situation including individual commodity trends and developments in farmstructure, labour productivity, net farm income and so on. In view ofvarious unpredictable factors affecting agricultural output and world market prices, the Annual Review White Paper does not attempt tomake precise forecasts for the future of agricultural production, resourceuse, and any associated public expenditure in support of agriculture. Norare the objectives of agricultural support policy defined in terms of specificlevels of output.Other assistance to agricultural production, food processing and marketing9. This heading covers expenditure by the agricultural departments on agricultural research, advisory services and the eradication and control of animal disease. The forecasts for 1977-78 and later years reflect lower staff numbers than were provided for in Cmnd 6393 and a postponement of expansion in expenditure on agricultural research and development. The1976-77 figure includes about  7 million in implementation of the guaranteegiven to sugar refiners and other buyers of sugar shipped to the UnitedKingdom in 1975 under the Lome Convention, and the figures for earlier years include expenditure for this and other measures taken in connectionwith sugar.Central and miscellaneous services10. Central services include the main expenditure by the agricultural departments and the Intervention Board on staff costs and administration
of agricultural programmes. They do not include the Agricultural Develop-ment and Advisory Service (attributed to &quot;other assistance to agricultural production&quot;). The forecasts reflect administrative savings from the ending ofcertain subsidies and other functions.11. Miscellaneous services include the staff costs and maintenance ofthe Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, Wakehurst Place and Edinburgh,expenditure on land management and smallholdings, assistance to crofters inScotland, publicity and miscellaneous grants including payments to inter-national organisations.Fisheries12. This programme mainly comprises grants and loans for new vessels and equipment, grants for the improvement of harbours, research anddevelopment, and fishing protection in Scottish waters. Additional expenditure is currently provided in support of trawler operations in certain distantwaters and, from 1977-78, the fisheries programme will contribute towardsthe cost of protective measures in British waters provided by the Ministryof Defence.13. Expenditure in 1976-77 on grants and loans for new vessels and equip-ment is considerably less than the provision in Cmnd 6393, and the forecasts for later years have been held at this lower level.Relationship of fisheries expenditure to policy objectives14. The general objective of this programme is to ensure a regular supplyof fish for consumers by maintaining a fishing fleet of such size and type aswill be best able to exploit sufficiently the resources available to it andmaximise the benefit to the UK economy. The conditions in which theindustry will be operating in the future will be heavily influenced by the outcome of discussions now in progress in the European Community. these discussions cover future fishing opportunities within the Community&apos;s 200miles fisheries limits and in the waters of third countries together with developments in the Community&apos;s Common Fisheries Policy, includingconservation measures and possible common action for restructuring theCommunity&apos;s fishing fleets.15. Landings by UK vessels of fresh and frozen fish (including shellfish)in 1974 and 1975 were between 850,000 and 950,000 tonnes. They accountedfor about 85 per cent of total supplies, excluding canned fish. The fishingfleet provides direct employment for about 17,000 full-time and about 5,000part-time people. Just over half of the regularly employed together with two-thirds of those employed part-time are in England and Wales and mostof the remainder are in Scotland.Forestry16. This item covers the Forestry Commission^ activities in promoting the interests of forestry, the establishment and maintenance of adequate reserves of growing trees and the production and supply of timber. The Com-
mission&apos;s activities divide between the Forestry Enterprise (a governmenttrading service) and the Forestry Authority. The expenditure figures includemainly the current expenditure of the Forestry Authority (including the grants it makes to the private sector), the capital expenditure of the ForestryEnterprise, and a subsidy to the Forestry Enterprise representing thedifference between its target rate of return of 3 per cent set by the Govern-ment and a notional cost of capital employed measured by the rulinggovernment lending rate. There are other subsidies on activities which arenot capable of producing the target rate but which the Commission under-takes for social reasons.17. The Forestry Enterprise is carrying out a combined planting andrestocking programme of up to 22,000 hectares a year of which about 18,000hectares is now planting. Over the survey period the forest estate is planned to increase from about 825,000 hectares to 910,000 hectares with a plantablereserve of about 80,000 hectares. Approximately 600 kilometres of newroads will be constructed and about 10 million cubic metres of timberharvested. The Commission provides substantial recreational facilities includ-ing camping sites and self-catering accommodation, information centres,picnic places and viewpoints with associated parking facilities, forest walksand nature trails.18. As the forestry authority, the Commission undertakes research intoall branches of forestry, controls felling in private woodlands and providestechnical advice to private woodland owners. The Commission pays grants for planting of timber-producing species subject to the acceptance by theowner of obligations relating to the management of the woodlands designedto secure sound forestry practice, good land use, environmental benefits and opportunities for recreation.Food subsidies19. In 1976-77 subsidies were paid on bread, butter, cheese, milk, teaand household flour. As announced on 15 December 1976, the food subsidiesprogramme is being phased out in the course of 1977-78.

The major part of the expenditure in this programme is disbursed by central government, including the Manpower Services Commission, etc.most of it by way of subsidies, grants and loans of various kinds. Most ofthe remainder of the programme is expenditure by public corporations andgrant-aided bodies, notably the National Enterprise Board and the scottish and Welsh Development Agencies. Just over two-fifths of the central govern-ment expenditure is cash limited. The programme is shown net of certainfees, such as those of the Patent Office and Companies Registration Office.Interest received on loans outstanding is taken into account in the newpresentation of debt interest.Regional support and regeneration2. This programme covers expenditure aimed at encouraging thedevelopment of industry, and the maintenance and creation of employment,in the assisted areas. Regional development grants are made available underPart I of the Industry Act, 1972, and Section 7 of that Act provides aflexible scheme of selective assistance by means of loans and grants. other forms of regional support include provision of factories and the use ofindustrial development certificates to encourage the location of new orexpanding industrial activities in the assisted areas. Provision is also included for the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies.Regional development grants3. Regional development grants under Part I of the Industry Act, 1972,are made towards the cost of buildings and plant and machinery to beused in qualifying activities at the rate of 22 per cent in the special develop-ment areas and 20 per cent in development areas. Grants are also madeat 20 per cent towards the cost of buildings in the intermediate areas.Under the new arrangements for the presentation of public expenditure the

This transfer is greaterthan the savings achieved by the exclusion of the mining and construction industries from those qualifying for grant and the introduction of a deferralin payments as announced in the Chancellor of the Exchequers statementof 22 July 1976, and the total forecasts are therefore higher than thoseappearing in programme 4 in Cmnd 6393.Provision of land and buildings4. In addition to expenditure under existing policies for land purchase and factory buildings, provision is made for additional expenditure onadvance factory building and modernisation included in the employmentcreating measures announced by the Government on 24 September 1975.Land purchase and factory building in Scotland and Wales is included underthe Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies (see paragraph 7). The fore-casts assume a continuing policy of factory building which it is expectedwill produce some 5,000 new job opportunities in 1977-78 and about 4,000in each year thereafter.&apos; -        &apos; t- s-Selective assistance to industry in the assisted areas5. Assistance under Section 7 of the Industry Act, 1972 is available on a selective basis for industrial projects which provide or maintainemployment in the assisted areas. It is additional to other non-selectiveregional incentives, such as Regional Development Grants, for which the projects may qualify. Assistance may be given in a number of forms, themost usual being loans or grants towards new capital expenditure and grants towards the removal costs when a firm is moving into an assistedarea.
6. The figures refer to net expenditure, which is expected to decreaseover the survey period, despite an increase in assistance offered, becauseof the build-up of loan repayments. During the period from the passing ofthe Industry Act to the end of the survey period it is estimated that projectsassisted under Section 7 will provide some 350,000 new jobs.Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies7. The main objectives of the Agencies are to accelerate the economicand industrial development of Scotland and Wales and to improve the environment consistently with that objective. In particular, they have the tasks of establishing or helping to establish new industrial enterprises,encouraging the growth of existing enterprises; and of planning, developing,maintaining, and managing industrial estates in Scotland and Wales and providing advance and purpose-built factories. The Agencies also undertakederelict land clearance programmes and major environmental schemes,including providing the co-ordinating management for the major urbanrenewal project in the East End of Glasgow. Increased provision is beingmade for the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies in 1977-78 and1978-79 (see paragraph 28 below).Regional employment premium8. Provision is made for residual expenditure under the scheme, whichas the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on 15 December 1976 isbeing withdrawn.Residual expenditure under repealed sections of the Local Employment Act,19729. Outstanding commitments to pay building grants, and grants underSection 4 of the Act, are estimated to be slightly lower than in Cmnd 6393,although it is expected that payments will not now be completed before1978-79. Repayment of loans will continue throughout the survey period.Industrial innovationGeneral industrial research and development10. This programme includes the Department of Industry&apos;s industrial research Establishments (IREs) and the Computer Aided Design Centre,work sponsored by the department at the Atomic Energy Authority (sea)and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), contract support for industrial research associations; and extra mural contracts with industryand the universities. The greater part of this work is managed throughresearch and development Requirements Boards. Grants-in-aid are made tothe National Computing Centre and the Design Council.11. The IREs include three multi-purpose laboratories (National PhysicalLaboratory, National Engineering Laboratory and Warren SpringLaboratory) and two more specialised establishments, the Laboratory of theGovernment Chemist and the National Maritime Institute. Support for theIREs, NERC and sea is expected to remain at broadly the same level overthe period to 1980-81. The Requirements Board will however increase their
support to industry and the research associations. Decisions on this pro-gramme will take into account the objectives identified in the Sector working party reports of the National Economic Development CounciFs industrialstrategy exercise. Increasing emphasis will be given to the encouragement of the commercial application by industry of new techniques, includingmanufacturing technology, energy conservation, and reclamation of waste.12. The level of receipts from all sources is expected to increase slightlyover the survey period from  7 million in 1976-77 to  8 million in 1980-81.13. As a contribution to savings in public expenditure, the programme has been reduced by  2 million in 1977-78 compared with Cmnd 6393.In addition the financial provision for manpower in the Industrial research establishments has also been reduced in all forward years of the survey.14. Expenditure by the Department of Energy to promote the competitive-ness of British industry in the field of offshore oil and gas operationsis included together with offshore geological studies, work to support theDepartment^ statutory responsibilities for the safety of offshore installations,and research and development of new energy sources and energyconservation.Technological and industrial sponsorship15. This programme covers cost-shared research and development con-tracts with industry, universities and other research bodies, including somejointly financed with the e.c. and other European countries, pre-production orders for advanced machinery, instrumentation and equipment work by theNatural Environment Research Council on minerals intelligence and reconnaissance programmes, grants for mineral exploration and investment and a grant-in-aid to the National Computing Centre for its software develop-ment scheme.16. Receipts include sales of pre-production instruments and equipment,and levies on further sales. Levies on cost-shared contracts are expected toincrease substantially during the survey period. Overall receipts were expectedto increase from  1 million in 1976-77 to  2 million in 1980-81.Aircraft and aero-engine projects and assistance17. Subject to the passage of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding IndustriesBill now before Parliament, the Government will in future be concernedwith the finance required for the new nationalised industry British Aero-space to carry on its business, rather than as at present with the govern-ment contribution to specific projects (see programme 5, paragraph 1).Aircraft and aero-engine general research and development18. Provision is made for research and experimental development in the fields of airframes, aero-engines and aircraft equipment. The work is carriedout at government research and development establishments, in industry and universities.
19. Subject to the passage of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding IndustriesBill, British Aerospace will take over responsibility in due course for research work directly relevant to its commercial activities and, with this in mind, the provisions for this programme have been reduced in comparisonwith Cmnd 6393. The Department of Industry will continue to supportcertain work on, for example, air safety, the reduction of aircraft noise andemissions and improved fuel economy, as well as work related to aero-engines and aviation equipment.Concorde20. The provision includes the United Kingdom share of the cost of the authorised programme of 16 aircraft, including spares and the cost of the manufacturers&apos; in-service support of the aircraft. The provision is net of receipts from sales of aircraft and spares to British Airways and Air France.RB 21121. The government-financed development programme for the RB 211-22and the production of the first 555 engines for the Lockheed TriStar hasnow reached the stage where receipts are exceeding expenditure, although,owing to the recession in the gas turbine market, this programme is not now expected to be completed until 1978-79. The programme also includessupport for the development of the more powerful RB 211-524 engine forthe TriStar and the Boeing 747.Other aircraft and aero-engine projects and assistance22. Provision is made for payments to the Ministry of Defence (Procure-ment Executive) for headquarters services on behalf of the Department ofIndustry, and for receipts from levies on sales of civil aircraft and engines,other than Concorde and the RB 211, developed with government support.After 1976-77, no provision is made for the HS 146 which, subject tothe passage of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, will become the responsibility of British Aerospace.Space23. Provision is made for the main part of the United Kingdom&apos;s contribu-tion to the European Space Agency and covers the United Kingdom&apos;s share in the Agency&apos;s applications programmes (ie aeronautical, meteorological,telecommunications, and maritime satellites and the Space Laboratory)together with a contribution to the Agency&apos;s overheads and to ArianeLauncher Technology. (The other part is provided by the Science research council programme 10, paragraph 15.) There is also provision for continu-ing commitments to a small national programme designed to help the UnitedKingdom space industry maintain its competitive position.Nuclear energy24. The greater part of the expenditure under this heading is for research and development work by the Atomic Energy Authority in support of theUnited Kingdom nuclear power programme. This is, however, subject toadjustment in the light of a current review of reactor programmes. Provision
is also made for certain other nuclear work, including fusion research; forthe international centrifuge project for enriching uranium (up to 1977-78);and for additional capital for British Nuclear Fuels Limited (up to 1976-77)and the Radio-chemical Centre Limited.General support for industryNational Enterprise Board25. Provision is made for capital investment by way of share acquisition and loans by the National Enterprise Board. The provision in 1977-78 and1978-79 includes the additional  50 million in each year announced by theChancellor of the Exchequer in the course of his statement of 15 December1976. No decision has yet been taken about the years beyond 1978-79 andthe figures should therefore be regarded as provisional.Selective assistance to individual industries, firms and undertakings26. Expenditure by the Department of Industry under Section 8 of theIndustry Act, 1972 includes assistance for counter cyclical investment underthe accelerated capital projects scheme, to which  120 million in cashterms has been allocated, and for a range of schemes to encourage the modernisation of key sectors of industry, to which  205 million has been allocated, in addition to the  15 million already made available for the wool textile scheme.27. By the end of November 1976, assistance of about  85 million hadbeen committed under the accelerated capital projects scheme to bring for-ward investment totalling  641 million. Assistance of  47 million had beenapproved under the various sectoral industry schemes in support of invest-ment of  232 million.28. The Government have already announced that they intend to move towards putting emphasis on selective, as against general, assistance to industry and that they plan to increase significantly the resources availablefor selective financial assistance to industry and to the National EnterpriseBoard and the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, so as to supportthe work on the industrial strategy now under way in the National economic development Council. In spite of the cuts which the Government have hadto make in the overall level of public expenditure, additional funds havebeen made available for selective assistance, in recognition of the prioritythe Government attach to support for manufacturing industry.  80 millionhas been provided for this purpose in each of the years 1977-78 and1978-79. Of this,  50 million has been allocated to the National EnterpriseBoard (see paragraph 25 above) and the remaining  30 million will be divided between the new selective investment scheme, additional expenditure under the sectoral approach in support of the industrial strategy, other measures to help industry in those years, and the Scottish and WelshDevelopment Agencies. The selective investment scheme, which will providefinancial assistance to firms for major projects to improve capacity and performance, has been allocated a total of  100 million of which the greaterpart is likely to be spent after 1978-79; separate provision will be made for expenditure falling in those later years.
29. The forecast also includes provision of  250 million in cash terms in support of British Leyland from 1976-77 onwards, in addition to the funds to be made available from the National Enterprise Board. Thereis also provision of  95 million (cash) for loans and grants to Chrysler (UK)Limited to help meet losses in 1976 and to assist the company&apos;s investment programme. Any additional expenditure under the terms of the Secretaryof State for Industry&apos;s statement to Parliament of 16 December 1975 wouldbe a call on the contingency reserve.30. Final payments of the  40 million assistance to InternationalComputers (Holdings) Limited under the Science and Technology Act, 1965were made in 1976-77 and provision is made for repayments later in the survey period.31. Expenditure by the Department of Energy is almost entirely on theOffshore Supplies Interest Relief Grant Scheme. Any new projects approvedunder Section 8 of the Industry Act, 1972 in support of companies involvedin supplying goods and services for offshore oil and gas operations wouldbe a call on the contingency reserve.Promotion of tourism32. This programme includes grants-in-aid to the British TouristAuthority and the English, Scottish and Welsh Tourist Boards; expenditureon tourist projects in the development areas under Section 4 of the Develop-ment of Tourism Act, 1969; and, up to 1977-78, provision for assistance tothe hotel industry under Part II of that Act. More detailed information about the expenditure of the statutory tourist organisations may be foundin their annual reports.Refinancing of home shipbuilding lending33. The Department of Industry refinances a proportion of the guaranteedcredit provided by the clearing banks at a fixed rate of interest to UnitedKingdom purchasers of ships built in United Kingdom shipyards. Therefinancing arrangements operate in conjunction with those for export credit(see paragraph 42). The refinancing requirement for 1977-78 and 1978-79is significantly lower than that forecast in Cmnd 6393, mainly because of theagreement by the clearing banks to increase their proportion of fixed rateexport and home shipbuilding credit finance.Assistance to the shipbuilding industry34. Subject to the passage of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding IndustriesBill, a large part of the shipbuilding industry will soon be nationalised. the financing requirements of the nationalised industry will then feature in Pro-gramme 5 (see programme 5, paragraph ]).35. Provision is made in this sub-programme for certain direct expenditure by the Government, mainly under the Industry Act, 1972. It covers, first, in
the earlier years, expenditure under the existing support schemes for GovanShipbuilders Limited, Cammell Laird Shipbuilders Limited and certainsmaller shipbuilders; and secondly, an allowance for possible further support which has not yet been committed, together with a small provision for thecost escalation insurance scheme for shipbuilding. These forecasts also includerepayments of loans made under the 1972 Act, under the ShipbuildingCredit Act, 1964 and under the Shipbuilding Industry Act, 1967.Other support services36. Provision is made for the Department of Energy&apos;s share of the costof the offshore protection force, a hydrographic survey to identify routessuitable for towing offshore oil and gas platforms built in the UK to theproduction positions, the energy saving loan scheme and regional advisory service, and the costs of the development of construction sites for offshoreoil and gas platforms. The forecast for the Department of Industry includesreceipts from loan repayments. Among these are loans made in respect ofthe liner QE2 and to the aluminium industry, and loans made by theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation. Subject to the necessary legislative authority, assistance will be made available to the film industry additional to that now provided in accordance with the Cinematograph Film Produc-tion (Special Loans) Acts, 1949 to 1970, and provision for this is made in1978-79.Investment grants37. Provision is made for residual expenditure under this scheme arisingfrom contracts entered into by companies before 27 October 1970.Support for nationalised industries (other than the transport industries)Assistance to the Coal Industry38. Provision for grants to the National Coal Board from 1976-77 onwardscovers assistance with social costs of pit closures, continued operation of the redundant mineworkers payments scheme, and assistance in meeting the deficiency in the mineworkers&apos; pension scheme. Provision is also made forassistance toward the cost of stocking coal in 1976-77.Other compensation39. The Department of Energy pays compensation to the central electricity Generating Board under the 1972 scheme for accelerating capital investment to maintain employment. Provision is also made for payment bythe Scottish Office to the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board towardslosses under the 1968 contract for the supply of electricity to the BritishAluminium Company at Invergordon. The heading covers payments by theDepartment of Industry under the re-adaptation scheme for assisting steel-workers made redundant since January 1973. Up to half the cost will bere-imbursed from the budget of the European Communities, and thesereceipts will be credited to &quot;Contributions to the European Communitiesetc (net)&quot; under programme 2.Other services40. This covers the costs in England, Wales and Scotland of the
electricity discount scheme which would allow householders receivingsupplementary benefits and Family Income Supplement to receive a 25 percent discount on one quarters electricity bills during the winter of 1976-77.A similar scheme is operating in Northern Ireland.International tradeExport promotion and trade co-operation41. This programme covers expenditure and receipts for export servicesand export promotional aid, which is managed by the British Overseas trade board; and subscriptions to international trade organisations. Most of theexpenditure represents assistance to British participants in overseas tradefairs and in overseas trade missions, but the programme also covers the overseas Projects Fund, research, education and training for overseas trade,and selective grants to non-official trade organisations.Refinancing of fixed rate export credits42. The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) refinances a proportion of fixed rate sterling credits provided by the clearing banks for periods of 2 years or more, the proportion depending on the level of the banks&apos; non-interest-bearing sterling &quot;sight&quot; deposits. A similar arrangementexists for home shipbuilding (see paragraph 33 above). The refinancingrequirement in 1977-78 and 1978-79 is considerably lower than that forecast for the same years in Cmnd 6393 as a result of the clearing banks&apos; havingagreed to increase their proportion of the fixed rate export finance from18 per cent to 21 per cent of their non-interest-bearing sterling &quot;sight&quot; depositswith effect from 1 April 1977, and to 22 per cent with effect from 1 April1978, and also because, as announced by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 15 December 1976, steps are being taken to encourage the use of foreign currency financing of medium and long term export credit and to control the growth of fixed-rate sterling credit.Cost escalation scheme43. The ECGD is empowered by the Export Guarantees Act, 1975 toprovide insurance against increases in certain costs of performing exportcontracts involving capital goods. This expenditure represents the extent towhich both payments under the scheme to exporters (which will not beginbefore 1977-78) and administration costs are expected to exceed the income from premia. The forecasts of expenditure are subject to considerable uncertainty since they depend on the rate of cost increases, the demand forthe scheme, and the extent to which exporters are successful in winningoverseas contracts. The forecasts assume that, subject to parliamentary approval, the scheme will continue for a further year from March 1977.Regulation of domestic trade and industry and consumer protection44. Provision is made for expenditure by the Department of Trade for thePatent Office (including expenditure in connection with the setting up of theEuropean Patent Office), and associated international subscriptions, and forthe Department^ Insurance and Companies Divisions and Insolvency Service.The Patent Office, Companies Registration Office and the Insolvency Servicelevy statutory fees towards the cost of the services provided. Receipts from
fees charged for these services are credited to the programme. These feescover some costs which fall on common services (programme 14), andon progamme 4 there is therefore a net surplus of receipts over expenditure.45. Provision is also made for grant assistance to the Steering Group onInflation Accounting. No further loan advances under the Air TravelReserve Fund Act, 1975 are expected to be required, and no provision ismade; the Government loan already made to the Air Travel Reserve FundAgency is being repaid in 1976-77.46. Also included too is expenditure by the Department of Prices and consumer Protection on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission; grants-in-aid to the National Council of Social Service in connection with the Citizens&apos;Advice Bureaux, the National Consumer Council and the Royal Society forthe Prevention of Accidents; support for five nationalised industryconsumer councils; and research on the 6afety of consumer goods. Thetemporary support for certain consumer advice measures in 1976-77announced in the &quot;Attack on Inflation&quot; (Cmnd 6151, paragraph 32), is continued into 1977-78 and is extended to include provision for existingconsumer advice centres previously financed by local authorities.47. Provision is also made for work on standards and quality assurance,mainly for the grant-in-aid to the British Standards Institution and for theMetrication Board which is expected to remain in operation until 1979-80.48. The programme also provides for the continuation of the work ofthe Office of Fair Trading in the spheres of competition policy and con-sumer protection and credit.Functioning of the labour market49. This programme aims to improve the functioning of the labour market through the services provided by the Department of employment and the Manpower Services Commission. It includes local authority expen-diture on the Careers Service. The expenditure of the Commission andits two executive arms, the Employment Service Agency (ESA) and theTraining Services Agency (TSA) is financed by grant-in-aid which represents the major part of the provision under this programme.50. Certain schemes for training, employment transfer, rehabilitation ofthe handicapped and career development of young people are eligible forassistance from the European Social Fund. These receipts are taken intoaccount in &quot;Contributions to the European Communities etc. (net)&quot; in tableManpower Services Commission51. The Manpower Services Commission (MSC) carries out its func-tions within a general policy framework agreed with the Secretary ofState for Employment. In the context of the development of a comprehensivemanpower policy, the Commission^ main activities are the improvement of
programmes for employment and training under the Employment andTraining Act, 1973. Most services are administered through the ESA andthe TSA. Resources have been made available in 1976-77 and 1977-78 toprovide additional employment and training facilities to mitigate the effects of high unemployment. These include, up to September 1977, the workexperience programme (run by the Commission itself) which aims toprovide 30,000 unemployed young people with first-hand work experience.The Commission also operates the job creation programme on an agencybasis for the Department.Employment services and employment rehabilitation52. The main expenditure is on the placing service of the ESA. Animportant element in the Agency&apos;s plans for improving its services tothe labour market and to employers and jobseekers is the programme for establishing Jobcentres in place of traditional Employment Exchanges.184 Jobcentres had been opened by the end of 1975-76, and experience in operating them has shown that they achieve 30-40 per cent moreplacings than comparable modernised employment offices. Another 140Jobcentres are scheduled to open by 31st March 1977, and the rate of opening is planned to continue at about 100 a year until 1981. improvements to the service are also being achieved by better training of employmentadvisors, by specialisation, and by improving organisation. professional and Executive Recruitment (PER), which is a fee earning service, aimsto achieve financial self-sufficiency in the next two or three years.Specialised placing services are provided for disabled people within theemployment services, together with rehabilitation facilities for about 15,000persons a year in various types of Employment Rehabilitation Centres.53. The following table gives figures for past years and projected figuresfor future years of vacancies notified, registrations for jobs and placings.The projected figures include the effect of the improvements expected fromthe planned development of ESA services; the registration figures allow for anincreased use of self-service facilities by job seekers including those still inemployment. It has been assumed that the increased use of ESA facilitiesby married women, observed since 1974, will continue. The year to yearresults are significantly affected by changes in labour market conditions whichare difficult to forecast, particularly towards the end of the period; theThousands1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76    1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80 1980-811.

figures used in the calculations are generally in line with the estimated numberof receipients of unemployment benefit which is used for the estimates inprogramme 12 (social security).54. The improvements made to the employment transfer schemehave led to an increased use of the scheme which is reflected in the forwardprojections. The ESA is currently reviewing the scheme to tailor it more closely to the needs of persons seeking transfer and to ensure the most effective use of resources available.Thousands	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80 1980-81Transfer Schemes									(i) Assisted Areas .	5.2	15.0	14.0	12.7	12.9	19.6	19.6	19.6	19.6      16.0(ii) Other Areas	3.2	3.6	2.0	2.4	3.2	4.9	4.9	4.9	4.9        4.0Total	8.4	18.6	16.0	15.1	16.1	24.5	24.5	24.5	24.5      20.055. The Careers Service is the responsibility of local authorities inEngland, Wales and Scotland. Provision has been made for the continua-tion in 1977-78 of grants to certain local authorities in areas of high unemployment amongst young people. The recruitment subsidy for schoolleavers paid to employers in 1975-76 and 1976-77 was superseded on 1October 1976 by the youth employment subsidy (which will operate until31 March 1977) under which grants are paid to employers who engageyoung people who have been continuously unemployed for at least sixmonths.Industrial training56. The TSA is responsible for carrying out industrial training policyand offering people training opportunities consistent with their wishesand employment needs, mainly through the training opportunities scheme(TOPS). Under that scheme, adult training is provided in Skillcentres,Colleges of Further Education, employers&apos; establishments, residentialcolleges for the disabled and other institutions. The courses vary in length,but the average in Skillcentres is about 28 weeks, in Colleges of further education about 26 weeks and in employers&apos; establishments about 10 weeks.Details of the numbers trained and expected to be trained are given in the table below.Thousands1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81Numbers trained									(i) Skillcentres    ...    13.6	15.8	17.1	17.3	19.8	23	26	28	31	33(ii) Colleges of Further									Education      ...     2.1	9.5	17.8	25.5	36.9	49	47	49	52	56(iii) Employers&apos;									Establishments...     0.7	6.0	5.4	6.7	9.1	10	12	11	11	11Total          ...    16.4	31.3	40.3	49.5	65.8	82	85	88	94	10057. The TSA also encourages the development of training in industry by funding the administrative expenses of Industrial Training Boards (ITBs),
by grant aiding the cost of certain key training schemes, and by meetingthe cost of providing training services to sectors of employment not covered by ITBs. The approximate number of group training schemes and training places to which the TSA contributed through key trainingschemes run by ITBs in the training years 1975-76 and 1976-77 is shown below:Training 1975-76 1976-77Group training schemes 723 7401st year apprentices 8,100 9,800Technicians 550 900Technologists 3,150 3,500Sandwich courses 430 480Other crafts 1,400 800In its forward planning, the TSA seeks to co-ordinate its training effortsunder TOPS with those of the ITBs, and to give high priority to trainingin skills whose continuing shortage could prevent industry from responding to increases in demand. Additional provision has been made for 1975-76,1976-77 and 1977-78 to assist apprentice and other training in a periodof high unemployment, and to increase the volume of direct training;these increases are reflected in the figures above.Payments from the Redundancy and Maternity Funds58. Payments were made from the Redundancy Fund in respect of364,000 people in 1975-76 compared with 262,000 in 1972-73, 157,000 in1973-74 and 210,000 in 1974-75. The forecasts assume a level of payments in 1976-77 of 320,000 and a reduction in 1977-78 and subsequent years.They reflect the Government^ decision to reduce the rebate to employersfrom 50 per cent to 40 per cent from 3 April 1977. The provisions ofthe Employment Protection Act in relation to maternity pay come intooperation from 6 April 1977, and the forecasts assume that rebate pay-ments will be made to employers from the Fund in respect of 185,000women in 1977-78 and 221,000 in each year thereafter.Industrial relations and other labour market services59. This heading covers the cost of Department of Employment staff engaged on general manpower, economic policy (manpower), industrial relations and incomes work, together with the Advisory Conciliation and arbitration Service (ACAS), the Office of Manpower Economics, industrialtribunals and an employment appeal tribunal. Provision is made to buildup the number of places in the community industry scheme, which employsdisadvantaged young people on tasks of social value, to 4,000 in 1976-77and to continue at that level in subsequent years.60. The forecasts also include expenditure on the temporary employ-ment subsidy, the job creation programme and the job release scheme, whichwere introduced as temporary measures to mitigate the effects of higherunemployment. Applications can be made under the temporary employmentsubsidy up to the end of April 1977. The subsidy is payable for 12 months,
and is expected to have resulted in the deferment of redundancy dismissalsof nearly 270,000 employees.61. Applications for assistance with projects under the job creationprogramme (run by MSC) can be submitted for approval up to the endof April 1977, and the programme is expected to have provided temporaryemployment for 75,000 workers, mainly young people. The job releasescheme provides from January 1977 for the payment of allowances inassisted areas to certain older workers whose employers agree to replace them with registered unemployed workers, and to certain registered unem-ployed workers who agree to withdraw from the labour market. A further 120 million has been made available in 1978-79 for temporary measuresto mitigate the effects of unemployment.62. The licensing of employment agencies under the employment agencies Act, 1973 commenced on 1 July 1976; the cost is borne by the fees charged.Central and miscellaneous services63. Provision is made for the salaries and general administrative expensesof the Department of Energy, the Department of Industry (including regional offices) together with those of the Departments of Trade and of Prices and consumer Protection, and for the expenses of the Price Commission. also included are subscriptions to international postal and telecommunicationsorganisations, and an estimate of the receipts from the sale of 17.4 per cent of British Petroleum stock.64. Provision is also made for expenditure on services for seriously dis-abled people by local authorities and on behalf of the Department ofEmployment, international relations work (mainly the subscription to theInternational Labour Office), the Royal Commission on the Distribution of incomes and Wealth, and central and common services not attributable toother employment programmes.65. The Department of Employment makes grants to Remploy Limited,local authorities and other bodies providing employment and training forseriously disabled people under sheltered conditions.

Health and safety at work66. This is a new heading covering the allocation to the Departmentof Employment for the activities of the Health and Safety Commission andthe Health and Safety Executive. The Commission carries out its functionswithin a general policy programme agreed with the Secretary of State for employment and financed by a grant-in-aid. The programme covers the detailed development of policies implicit in the Health and Safety at Worketc. Act, 1974, which extended protection to some 8 million employees not previously covered. It requires the Health and Safety Executive to integratethe various operational organisations concerned with the wide field of occupational health and safety, and to promote their development.

The table shows the total of net government lending to the nationalised industries^). This represents the main element in the newpresentation of nationalised industries in public expenditure. Under thispresentation, all government funds provided to the nationalised industries in the form of grants and subsidies (included in tables 2.4, 2.6 and 2.8), loans and public dividend capital (PDC) are included in the public expendituretotals. The total of government funds reflects the savings in the requirements for government finance of  110 million net in 1977-78 and  130 million in1978-79 announced in the Chancellor of the Exchequers statement of ISDecember.The investment programmes2. The investment programmes of the nationalised industries as suchare not included in these totals. But a review of these programmes remainspart of the annual public sector survey. The special analysis in this white paper of nationalised industries&apos; capital investment and financing (Part 3)includes a table showing the figures for each industry, and a comparison ofthe totals with Cmnd 6393, and descriptive texts.Net government lending3. The net government lending line takes account of the extent to whichthe nationalised industries have secured or are assumed to secure financefrom other sources, principally overseas, in some years which may requirerefinancing by the Government in other years. The starting point for the calculation of net government lending was the industries&apos; own estimates of net borrowing, other than short-term borrowing, which they would requireto finance their investment programmes. In the light of these estimatesaction was agreed with the industries to reduce their demand on the PSBRby  110 million net in 1977-78 and  130 million in 1978-79. Adjustmentswere then made for shortfall and for foreign currency borrowing. Account(t) The industries covered are those whose investment programmes are included in Table 3.1,in Part 3 i.e. the same as in Programme 5 of Cmnd 6393. As explained in paragraph 6 ofPart 3, no provision is made for British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders.

Forward estimates for net foreign currency borrowing by the nationalised industries are subject to special uncertainties because theydepend not only on the financing needs of the nationalised industries them-selves but also on the overall external financing needs of the UK and on international market conditions. The total given for the current financialyear reflects such borrowing undertaken so far. The figures for 1977-78 and1978-79 reflect what is no more than a working assumption that there willbe net borrowing by the industries though at decreasing levels. Both theBritish National Oil Corporation (BNOC) and British Airways haveopportunities for foreign borrowing on overseas markets not open to therest of the public sector, and this has been taken into account.Price basis5. The survey price basis for the forecasts is as follows. For 1976-77the figures are at estimated outturn prices (ie they show the expected cashrequirement). For the other years they represent cash figures revalued to the1976-77 level by general price indices.
Financing tables6. It is not possible to forecast the financing requirements of individual industries with any accuracy for more than a year or so ahead. For thisreason net government lending is aggregated and for 1978-79 no breakdownis shown between loans and issues of public dividend capital. However thespecial section on the nationalised industries includes tables for 1976-77and 1977-78 showing how each industry expects to finance its capital requirements. The figures for 1976-77 represent an updating of Table 13in the Financial Statement and Budget Report (FSBR) and show that overallthe industries expect to remain well within the cash limits published in thattable. Those for 1977-78 are provisional estimates which will be revised,after further discussion with the industries, before cash limit figures for1977-78 are published in the spring in the FSBR table.Total public expenditure on the nationalised industries7. The total of public expenditure on the nationalised industries in this white Paper consists of three elements: the net government lending shown above; those capital grants not shown before (to avoid double counting withthe investment they financed); and other grants. All grants are includedin programmes 4, 6 and 8.

A little over half this programme is attributable to local authoritiesand a little under half to central government. The main elements of central government expenditure are construction and improvement of motor-ways and trunk roads, and British Rail passenger and other subsidies,as shown in the table. Expenditure by local authorities is incurred mainly on construction and maintenance of roads, investment in public transport and, since 1974-75, on subsidies to local transport. Revenue from parkingfacilities is referred to in paragraph 17. With minor exceptions the wholeof the programme is either directly cash limited or is subject to cash limitsimposed on local authority borrowing and on rate support grant andtransport supplementary grant.general. The provisional status of the figures in this White Paper for theyears beyond 1977-78 is explained in the Introduction. There are furtherparticular qualifications which apply to the figures for this programme.3. First, a review of the whole field of transport policy is in hand.This was launched by publishing a consultation document on transport policy in April, 1976. Consultations are continuing and the Secretary ofState expects to present his conclusions in a White Paper in the spring of1977.4. Second, since revised and reduced programmes of expenditure on roads and transport were published in Cmnd 6393, two further revisionsto the programmes have been made by the Government as elements intheir economic measures announced in July and December 1976. the combined effect of these and other changes since Cmnd 6393 has been toreduce the total provision for 1977-78 by  183 million and for 1978-79by  93 million. No adjustment has been made yet, however, in the provisionfor years after 1978-79, in consequence of those measures.

The reductions		which have	been made	in the	short-term	have hadto be directed mainly to capital expenditure on roads. The particular rela-tionship which thus results between this capital expenditure and expenditureon other aspects of transport, especially subsidies, is one of the matters which has to be considered further in the current review of transport policy generally. It is not possible in this White Paper to anticipate the outcome of that review.Motorways and trunk roads: EnglandNew construction and improvement6. Of the reductions in England announced in July and December 1976, 93 million related to capital expenditure on motorways and trunk roadsin 1977-78 and  50 million in 1978-79. To achieve these reductions anumber of schemes which were due to start between July and December1976 have been held back, and there is a six month ban on the lettingof new contracts from mid-December 1976, including some for whichtenders have been invited. When the ban is lifted, priority within the reduced programme will be given to those schemes with the greatest potentialeconomic and environmental benefits.Maintenance1. Planned expenditure in England in 1977-78 has been reduced,compared with Cmnd 6393, by  6 million to  52 million. Reductions arebeing concentrated on all-purpose trunk roads. A careful watch is being kept for any diminution in safety standards. The Government plan totransfer to local authorities, with their cooperation, stretches of road where an alternative motorway or all-purpose trunk road has been provided; asa result,  1 million has been transferred from this heading to local road maintenance.
Motorways and trunk roads: Scotland8. The Scottish trunk road programme retains as its main objectivethe improvement of trunk roads which will contribute to the economic development of Scotland, largely but not entirely in the more densely popu-lated and industrialised central area and in the North and North-Eastaffected by North Sea oil development. The reductions in planned expen-diture of  15 million in 1977-78 and  13 million in 1978-79 will delay someof these and other improvements.Motorways and trunk roads: Wales9. The principal objectives remain unchanged. These are the improve-ment of east/west communications across both North and South Wales,and of the road links between Wales and the major industrial and com-mercial areas of England. The westward extension of the M4 Motorway a project vital to the economy of industrial South Wales remains the dominantsingle item in terms of public expenditure in the earlier years covered bythis White Paper. Once the motorway nears completion, resources will be concentrated on the improvement of the A55 North Wales coast road.Local transport: England and Wales10. This section covers transport expenditure for which local authoritiesare responsible. The present system of transport policies and programmes(TPPs), with the transport supplementary grant (TSG), is intended toenable local authorities to adopt a comprehensive approach in planning the efficient use of their transport resources. The grant is based on estimates of expenditure accepted by the Government.11. Actual expenditure in 1975-76 was below the planned level and present estimates indicate some short-fall in 1976-77. In both years the pattern of expenditure differs from that in Cmnd 6393, with lower levels of capital expenditure and road maintenance offset by higher subsidies for public transport. Following discussions with the local authority asso-ciations, the estimates of current expenditure in 1977-78 and subsequent years have been substantially increased, largely for revenue support for busand underground services and for concessionary fares, while provision for capital expenditure on roads and car parks has been correspondingly re-duced.12. The provision for 1977-78 reflects cuts of  17 million announced in July 1976, and  27 million in December 1976. Advice to authoritiesin August 1976 not to start new construction projects which would commitexpenditure for 1977-78 was subsequently extended for six months from mid-December 1976.CapitalRoads new construction and improvement13. Compared with Cmnd 6393, provision is sharply reduced as a resultof the transfers to current expenditure mentioned above and the reductions
announced in July and December 1976. When local authorities recommencethe letting of new contracts, the provision for 1977-78 will allow for onlya very limited programme of new projects.Car parks14. The estimates allow for only inescapable commitments in 1977-78and for very few new car parks to be started in subsequent years.Public transport investment15. A substantial part of the provision relates to the construction of theTyneside Metro, renewal of rolling stock and equipment on the LondonUnderground, and the purchase of new buses. The amount of investment bypassenger transport executives and local authorities in local rail servicesincluded in this total is also shown separately in paragraph 46 of the section on nationalised industries&apos; capital investment and financing.CurrentRoads maintenance16. The local authorities, in their TPPs, plan to reduce expenditure on maintenance in 1977-78 as requested by the Government in 1975. In viewof the concern which the local authority associations have expressed aboutroad safety and road structures, the Government have agreed that for thetime being the estimates should be kept at about the same level throughthe rest of the period. A sum of  9 million a year for street cleansingunder public health legislation has been transferred to other environmental services (programme 8).Car parks17. In Cmnd 6393, the Government expressed the view that the revenue from car parking ought to be sufficient by about 1978-79 to meet runningexpenses and the cost of servicing the capital invested. The estimate of net revenue was increased to  25 million to reflect this policy. Since then,however, at the request of the local authority associations the Governmenthave agreed to a more gradual increase in net revenue, reaching  19million in 1980-81. In 1977-78 expenditure is expected to be  35 million and receipts  42 million.Other expenditure18. These estimates, which cover mainly expenditure on publicity andtraining for road safety, have been reduced by  3 million a year comparedwith Cmnd 6393, to  9 million in 1977-78.Local authority administration19. Provision is little changed since Cmnd 6393.Passenger transport subsidies British Rail20. These are subsidies paid to British Rail by passenger transport execu-tives and local authorities to meet losses arising on local rail services
which the authorities consider to be a necessary part of the transport system in their areas. Actual payments are negotiated annually by theRailways Board and the relevant authority on principles agreed with theDepartment of Transport, but the estimates provide for a stable level of support.Passenger transport subsidies bus, underground and ferry services21. The estimated expenditure of  165 million in 1976-77 is slightlybelow that in 1975-76, but much in excess of the provision for 1976-77 of 112 million, in Cmnd 6393. The excess arises in London and the metro-politan counties. Provision for these subsidies in Cmnd 6393 was  87million in 1977-78 and  60 million in 1978-79. It became clear, however, thatthese levels could not be achieved without increases in fares and reductions in services which were unacceptable to the local authorities concerned.Following discussions between the local authority associations and theDepartment of Transport, the provision for 1977-78 has been increased by 47 million. The provisions for the later years reflect this higher starting point but fall over a period of four years to the target level for Englandand V/ales of  60 million provided for in Cmnd 6393.Concessionary fares22. The reduction called for in Cmnd 6393 was not achieved, but ingeneral local authorities have not extended the scope of concessions. Theestimates for 1977-78 and subsequent years reflect only increases in thenumbers of elderly people and the take-up rate of existing schemes, to-gether with a small increase to cover certain reduced fares for childrenwhich some authorities have included.23. Concessionary fares give help to many people who would otherwise be deprived of adequate means of travel. The scale of provision varieswidely between different authorities, however, and the cost of concessionshas risen steeply in recent years. The whole subject is being reviewed in the light of the response to the consultation document and the studybeing undertaken by the joint working party appointed by the consultative council on Local Government Finance.Local transport: Scotland24. This section covers the transport expenditure for which regional and islands councils in Scotland are responsible. Reductions in the local authorityroads and transport capital programmes will restrict them mainly to existing commitments (including in particular the major Glasgow Underground andClyde Rail transport projects) and schemes to serve oil-related traffic,support housing and industrial development and meet statutory obligationsfor road safety. The reduced provisions will, however, reinforce the emphasiswhich regional and islands councils are already giving to projects whichsecure the best use of existing transport assets rather than those designedto extend transport networks.25. While it is for regional and islands councils to decide their revenue expenditure in the light of their assessment of priorities, it is expected that
they will make further reductions in expenditure over the next few years.Meanwhile, the figures follow the provision in Cmnd 6393.Central government supportNationalised Industries26. The largest item in this block is support to the passenger servicesof the British Railways Board. This support consists primarily of grant toenable the Board to meet the public service obligation laid on it by theGovernment under the Railways Act, 1974. Provision for this grant hasbeen reduced in 1977-78 as a contribution toward the public expenditure cuts announced on 15 December 1976. For subsequent years the provisionallows for the maintenance of the grant in real terms within the 1975level.27. Further passenger subsidies, from passenger transport executivesand local authorities, are included in local transport (paragraph 20 above).28. Following the change in presentation of public expenditure, grantstoward infrastructure investment under Section 56 of the Transport Act,1968 are included for the first time. Provision is also made for three othergrants to the Board, for level crossings, freight and pensions. Level crossinggrant, now shown separately, was included with passenger subsidies in cmnd 6393. The tapering support to rail freight provided in Cmnd 6393now allows for better trading experienced in 1976.29. Two other industries require support in 1976-77 and subsequently:a. the National Freight Corporation has since January 1976 receivedtransitional grant, at the expense of its investment provision in cmnd 6393, pending completion of a review of its financial obliga-tions and future strategy.b. the Scottish Transport Group&apos;s subsidiaries, Caledonian MacBrayneand David MacBrayne, will continue to receive revenue grantbased on their estimated deficits, to an extent which will ensurecontinued provision of the shipping services to the Western Islesat an adequate level. These revenue grants are made under the highlands and Islands Shipping Services Act, 1960; a similar grantis made to the Orkney Islands Shipping Company for internalsea transport services to the North and South Isles of Orkney.Other30. The main item provides for 50 per cent grants towards the cost of buying new buses for use on stage services. While these grants are subjectto cash control, the provision allows for about the same level of support in real terms in 1977-78 as in previous years. Total investment in new busesby the local authority sector appears under local transport in table 2.6.In order to avoid double counting, therefore, provision is made here for
grants to nationalised industries and to the private sector only. The futureof this grant is under review.31. Other central government subsidies now consist chiefly of grantspayable under the Railways Act, 1974 toward the provision of facilitiesfor loading or unloading rail freight. Following the change in presentation,table 2.6 now includes grants to both nationalised industries and the private sector.Ports and shippingPorts32. This item covers port investment by the independent harbour trustsand by local authority-owned harbours, and loans to ports in the private sector. Continuing investment needs reflect North Sea oil developments,further growth of containerisation and cross-channel traffic, together witha variety of port development designed to meet specific industrial needs.Provision has been made for a tanker jetty at Peterhead Bay, the expenditureon which will be matched by contributions from the prospective users.Provision is also made in the later years for the further extension of the oil terminal at Sullom Voe.Shipping services33. Expenditure under this programme is directed mainly towards main-taining and improving safety around the coasts and at sea. Provision ismade for the coastguard service, surveys of ships, the examination of sea-men, navigational broadcasts, the operation of a trawler support ship, thesurveillance of traffic in the English Channel, and measures to deal withoffshore oil pollution. The cost of United Kingdom membership of theIntergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation is also borne onthis programme.Civil aviation services34. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has the financial objective ofrecovering its costs and securing a reasonable return on capital from theusers of its services as soon as possible. Until the Authority breaks evenprovision is made for a grant in aid to meet its deficit on revenue account.35. Also included in this programme are the CAA&apos;s capital expenditure(mainly on equipment and installations for the National Air Traffic Services);local authorities&apos; capital expenditure on aerodromes; aviation securityexpenditure; airport development grants to the British Airports Authority(which are now classified as public expenditure under the revised presenta-tion); the United Kingdom&apos;s subscriptions to euro control and to the Inter-national Civil Aviation Organisation; a subsidy from the Scottish Officeto Loganair for operating third level air services to the Highlands and Islands;and a number of other minor services.
36. After some years of steady expansion, the number of aircraft move-ments handled by the National Air Traffic Services levelled off in 1974 and1975 at around 1.2 million, showing only a marginal increase over the movements handled in 1973. However, the proportion of high speed andwide-bodied aircraft used by the airlines continues to increase, and the CAAis continuing its re-equipment programme which is designed to moderniseand improve United Kingdom air traffic control facilities.Other transport services37. This item includes expenditure on central government administration,transport research and certain minor items. Provision has also been madefor receipts of fees for services such as driving tests and vehicle tests whichare expected to amount to some  19 million in 1976-77.

Table 2.7 provides a more detailed breakdown than previous white papers for the years up to 1978-79. The figures and breakdown are morethan usually provisional for later years for reasons as explained in the intro-duction on page 1; for this reason a less detailed breakdown is given for1979-80 and 1980-81. The figures for later years will also be subject tofurther consideration when policy decisions are taken on the mattersexamined in the Governments reviews of housing policy in England andWales, and in Scotland. The published reviews will also contain additionalmaterial about the housing programme generally.
3. The public expenditure measures announced in July includedreductions of  146 million in the total housing figure for 1977-78: the furtherpolicy measures announced in December in consequence of general economic developments included increases in housing of  20 million in 1977-78 and reductions of  300 million in 1978-79. The figures in Table 2.7 show thenet result of these measures and of other changes in individual sub-programmes during the year. They also show the comparison with Cmnd6393. It has been necessary to contribute an appropriate share from housingto the reductions required in public expenditure in 1977-78 and 1978-79, atthe same time as finding room, within the annual totals, for the large increases in subsidy expenditure, both from central government and from the rates,arising mainly from large increases in interest rates, but also from thedecision on rents referred to in paragraph 4 below.Subsidies4. The figures for central government subsidies cover grants paid tothe housing revenue accounts of local authorities, the Scottish special housing Association and new towns and also revenue deficit grants to housing associations. In addition to these subsidies and rate fund contri-butions paid to housing revenue accounts, income related support is given to public sector tenants by way of rent rebates, and to private sector tenantsthrough rent allowances (see table below). The forecast figures are basedmainly on trends in costs and income to the public sector housing revenueaccounts; precise amounts of central government subsidies payable in any year will depend on entitlement under the relevant legislation. The figuresfor 1977-78 are based on the assumption of an average rent increase of 60pence in England and Wales used in the rate support grant settlement. Thesubsidy figure is, as already noted above, higher than in Cmnd 6393 largely because the prospects for loan charges, which comprise on average about two-thirds of total expenditure in housing revenue accounts, have worsenedover the last year.Recipients^) of rent rebates and allowances: Great BritainThousandsRent rebates	Rent allowances	Total	1972-73                                1,820	134	1,954	1973-74                                2,070	344	2,414	1974-75                                2,070	384	2,450	1975-76                                2,362	630	2,992	1976-77 (provisional)              2,445	645	3,090	(i) Including tenants in receipt of Supplementary Benefit.

In view of the provisional status of the figures, no subdivision of localauthority housing investment has been shown for 1979-80 and 1980-81.The balance of expenditure within the investment programme may well have to be adjusted in the light of the policy reviews, and also to reflectchanges (some being implemented and others under discussion with local
authorities) to give local authorities more flexibility in determining thecomponents of their housing investment programmes in relation to localneeds.Housebuilding6. The figures for approvals of new housebuilding by local authorities,new towns, housing associations and the Scottish Special Housing Associa-tion are shown in the table below. In order to contain expenditure withinthe planned provision, control was reintroduced, as part of the Julymeasures, over housebuilding tender acceptances by local authorities. Withthe reintroduction of this control, priority in allocating the available resources is being given to meeting housing stress in particular areas andother special needs. Control has been reimposed on land purchases, and expensive schemes are being subject to special scrutiny; these changes havebeen made so as to ensure that regard is had to the need for general economy.The future approval figures will also reflect the effects of the July and december measures on new towns and housing associations. In Scotland,the future provision for new housebuilding is based on a substantiallysmaller programme of approvals in the public sector, reflecting reassess-ments of local housing needs made by the new local authorities.Permanent new dwellings approved: local authorities, new towns, housing associations and the Scottish Special Housing Association : Great BritainNumber of dwellings	Local authorities		Housing		(including SSHA)	New Towns	associations	Total1970	110,000	10,000	5,500	125,5001971	110,300	8,300	8,000	126,6001972	91,000	13,800	9,000	113,8001973	92,200	11,800	7,400	111,4001974	121,700	13.500	13,000	148,2001975	127,900	18,000	26,200	172,1001976 (provisional)	119,000	14,000	35,000	168,000Acquisitions and improvements7. Provision is made for acquisition of dwellings by local authorities throughout the period; the measures announced in July and Decemberincluded reductions in England in 1977-78 and 1978-79. For improvementinvestment by local authorities, the programme has been protected as far aspossible in making the reductions; this reflects the current emphasis onrehabilitation rather than clearance and new building. Provision for improve-ment grants in 1977-78 has been reduced to reflect a continued low volumeof applications in England and Wales.

The building societies haveagreed in principle as a continuing operation in 1977-78 to try to help fill the gap caused by the reduction in local authority lending by assisting someof those who would previously have looked to a local authority for a mortgage.Local authorities loans to private persons for house purchase: England andWalesNumber of loansNew dwellings Other dwellings All dwellings1970 2,600 41,500 44,1001971 2,700 44,500 47,2001972 1,900 43,300 45,2001973 2,700 56,700 59,4001974 4,600 70,800 75,4001975 6,500 95,500 102,000Stock of dwellings : by tenure 1966 to 1975 : Great BritainRented from local authorities or new		town development corporations		Owner occupied			Thousand	Percentage of total	Thousand	Percentage of totalApril	1966*	4,957	28.4	8,146	46.6end	1968	5,387	29.5	8,898	48.8end	1970	5,698	30.4	9,356	50.0April	1971*	5,733	30.4	9,427	50.1end	1972	5,865	30.5	9,877	51.4end	1973	5,920	30.5	10,134	52.2end	1974	6,054	30.9	10,312	52.5end	1975	6,223	31.3	10,494	52.8		Rented from private owners and					other tenures		Total stock	Total households		Thousand	Percentage of total	Thousand	ThousandApril	1966*	4,365	25.0	17,468	17,320end	1968	3,949	21.7	18,234	17,830end	1970	3,677	19.6	18,731	18,190April	1971*	3,673	19.5	18,833	18,200end	1972	3,471	18.1	19,213	18,580end	1973	3,361	17.3	19,415	18,740end	1974	3,261	16.6	19,627	18,890end	1975	3,153	15.9	19,870	19,040*Census date.

The capital expenditure of water authorities and of new towncorporations (other than on housing which is included in programme 7)accounts for around one-quarter. There is a small element of centralgovernment expenditure (for example that on royal palaces and historicbuildings etc.). Nearly all expenditure is on goods and services, about halfof it on capital account. Expenditure on current account is shown netof revenue from admission fees and other charges for services describedmore fully below. At present, these fees and charges amount to about 200 million. With only minor exceptions expenditure in the programmefrom 1977-78 will be subject to direct or indirect cash limits.Water services . Responsibility for water services in England and Wales lies withnine regional water authorities and the Welsh National Water Develop-ment Authority. These services consist mainly of water supply and conserva-tion, sewerage and sewage disposal, land drainage, prevention of waterpollution, fisheries and amenity and recreation associated with water. the approximate breakdown of capital expenditure between these services, since1974 when the water authorities started operating, has been 63i per centon sewerage and sewage disposal, 30 per cent on water supply and conserva-tion, 5 per cent on land drainage and H per cent on other services. Theauthorities are however required to manage the various services as awhole. Current expenditure is met from charges and does not enterinto the total of public expenditure. In Scotland responsibility for waterservices, capital expenditure on which is in much the same proportions(66 per cent for sewerage and sewage disposal, 34 per cent for water supply)rests primarily with the regional and islands councils.

Capital expenditure by the water authorities is controlled by theallocation of ceilings to each authority. In order to develop effectivecorporate planning, the authorities are working with Departments .toestablish the form and content of medium term plans to support their annual capital investment proposals. The first plans in the agreed formwill be submitted early in 1977. In addition, surveys are in progress toestablish the provision required for the replacement of outworn assets. InScotland block allocations for water supply and sewerage capital expenditure were introduced in 1976-77 as part of a new system of financial planning and control.4. As part of the Governments measures to reduce public expenditureannounced on 22 July 1976, the capital programme to be undertaken bythe water authorities in 1977-78, as set out in Cmnd 6393, was reduced by9\ per cent. A smaller reduction has been made for the following year. InDecember 1976, when further reductions were announced for the pro-gramme for 1977-78 and 1978-79 reducing expenditure to well belowcurrent levels, the commencement of new construction works by the water authorities was suspended for six months. Within the reduced provisionthe Governments priorities remain the provision of services to meeturgent public health needs, new housing and industrial development. Thefigures for 1979-80 and 1980-81 in table 2.8 are provisional and will bere considered in the course of the 1977 survey of public expenditure. ForScotland, the water services capital programme for 1977-78 and 1978-79includes reductions of 10 per cent made as part of the cuts announced in December 1976. Within the reduced Scottish provision, priority will begiven to the servicing of new housing and industrial development and to new water supply sources to eliminate seasonal shortages. There will be
very limited scope for new sewage treatment schemes. The provisionalfigures for 1979-80 and 1980-81 reflect the need to allow scope for essentialschemes.5. Two-thirds of public water supply in England and Wales is non-metered (mainly for domestic purposes) and one-third is metered con-sumption (mainly for industrial use). Industrial requirements are metmainly by direct abstraction from rivers and boreholes. Public watersupply in England and Wales for the recent past and estimated in thefuture is shown in the table below.Public water supplyTotal (million cubic metres a day)	Non-metered			Total (million cubic metres a day)	Per head (litres a day)	1970           14.0	8.7		1781975           15.2	9.9		2001981           17.4	11.1		225The estimated future supply of water largely reflects the forecast increasein per capita consumption and changes in population. Most of the watersupplied to both metered and non-metered consumers is discharged after useinto the sewerage system, and the demand on the system will rise broadlyin line with the supply of water. The main purpose of capital expenditureon the water services is to meet growing demand, but about a quarter oftotal capital expenditure by water authorities is spent on maintaining theexisting level of services. The picture in Scotland is similar. Demand onthe public water supply is increasing at a rate of about 1 per cent per yearoverall, but is expected to increase to 2 per cent per year particularly inview of the needs of oil-related development.British Waterways Board6. The British Waterways Board receives grants in respect of essentialmaintenance of its waterways and the improvement to modern trafficstandards of bridges carrying public roads over the waterways. Provision for maintenance is kept at the Cmnd 6393 levels pending the outcome of a jointreview of long term policy which the Board are conducting with the Depart-ment of the Environment.Local environmental services. This group of mainly local authority services includes refusecollection and disposal, smoke control, public conveniences and other publichealth expenditure, the reclamation of derelict land, the provision of parks and recreational facilities, the provision of municipal buildings and adminis-trative services, and activities carried out under the Town and Country Plan-
ning Acts as well as a number of minor services such as private street works,coast protection, civic theatres and restaurants, retail markets, cemeteriesand crematoria.CAPITAL8. Most of the services in this group in England and Wales come within the locally determined sector arrangements for controlling capitalexpenditure. In this sector an annual block borrowing consent is notified to local authorities. They are free to spend at their own discretion up tothis amount, plus what they choose to meet from revenue or capital receipts.The locally determined sector covers a wide variety of projects, including some which fall in other programmes (see table 4.5). It is not possibleto forecast with any accuracy how much will be spent on any particular service. The derelict land reclamation programme and the coast protectionprogramme are controlled by separate key sector borrowing approval inEngland, while in Scotland and Wales the full costs of the derelict landprogrammes are met by the appropriate Development Agencies. In Scotlandlocal authority capital expenditure is subject to specific consent, but as from april 1977 will be controlled by block allocations within a system of financialplans.9. The Government has been discussing with the local authority associations the means by which expenditure on other environmental services can be brought within the levels in the White Paper. One measure which the Government and the local authority associations have agreed is thetransfer of some  15 million (England) in 1977-78 from the provision for capital expenditure to the total of current expenditure, and similar transfershave also been made for the subsequent years. The savings in capitalexpenditure on other environmental services announced by the Chancellorof the Exchequer in July and December 1976, together with the abovetransfers, mean that provision for local environmental services in Englandand Wales in 1977-78 has been reduced by about a third from the levels setout in Cmnd 6393. These reductions are reflected in the total annual borrow-ing limits notified to local authorities. The savings will be achieved in 1977-78in part by a six months&apos; moratorium on new projects. Local authorities will again, as in 1976-77, have to devote their allocations to projects which arealready committed under contract or are otherwise essential.10. Outturn figures in England and Wales for the last complete year(1975-76) suggest that there may already be a downward trend on expenditure on sport and recreation, away from the comparatively high levels of recent years. On the other hand expenditure on refuse collection and disposal showed an upturn. Expenditure on administration (ie the provisionof offices) remained fairly steady. Because there has been little scope forplanned additional expenditure in 1976-77 and greatly reduced expenditure is provided for subsequent years, the future pattern will almost certainly be governed by existing commitments and other essential expenditure.Reductions in the provision for Scotland of about 20 per cent in 1977-78and 1978-79 have been made as part of the general reductions announced
in July and December 1976. The reduced provision in these years and in theprovisional figures for the following years will mean restricted scope for new capital projects on most services.CURRENT11. The figures for local authority current expenditure in 1977-78 reflect the decisions taken following consultations with the local authority associa-tions leading to the rate support grant settlement. These consultations areconducted separately for England and Wales and for Scotland.England and Wales12. The provision for local authority expenditure on these environmental services in 1977-78 shows a reduction of 2.4 per cent on the estimated levelof spending in 1976-77. A further reduction of 3.9 per cent is implied by thefigure for 1978-79, after which the provisional figures for the last two yearsof the survey period remain constant. It is for local authorities to decide how to contain their expenditure within the survey limits, but it is expectedthey will give priority to the maintenance of existing public health standards.Income from charges, whilst more significant in the case of recreational facilities, makes a contribution towards the cost of several local environ-mental services. Over these services as a whole charges meet about one-eighth of gross costs. Local authorities will need to pay close attentionto their charging policies ensuring, in the first place, that the level of charges in real terms is maintained and that services which can be self-financing do not incur a deficit. Use of manpower will need to be as effective and economical as possible, particularly in administration and planning work.Scotland13. The figures for 1977-78 and 1978-79 allow for spending at thelevel of the rate support grant settlement in 1976-77 after transfer of provision from other Scottish programmes. The level of outturn in 1975-76and of spending planned by the local authorities in 1976-77 was in excess ofthe resources now available for later years and considerable effort will berequired to achieve savings by more efficient and economical provision of services and by reviewing charging policies.Community ownership of development land14. This item provides for the capitalised costs to local authorities andthe Land Authority for Wales of purchasing land including debt charges and administration and making it available for private development in their areas. The estimates are net of receipts from land disposals.Royal palaces and royal parks15. Expenditure covers * maintenance, etc, of royal palaces and royalparks throughout the United Kingdom, and is being restricted to cover thesame level of work as in 1976-77. The figures are net of admission fees and licences, expected to be some  0.3m each year.
Historic buildings and ancient monuments16. This item covers grants for the repair of historic buildings, otherrelated services, and expenditure on the purchase, maintenance, repair anddisplay of ancient monuments, and emergency excavations for recordingmonuments before sites are developed. More detailed information of thework in this field is available in the annual reports of the Historic BuildingsCouncils and the Ancient Monuments Boards for England, Scotland andWales, and in the Department of the Environment^ annual publication:&quot;Archaeological Excavations&quot;. Expenditure is being restricted to maintainthe same level of work as in 1976-77 and is net of admission fees, rents,sales etc. expected to be some  3.2 million each year. Numbers of visitors to ancient monuments were in 1973, 16,100,400; in 1974, 15,229,100 and in1975, 15,695,400.Central and miscellaneous environmental services17. The major part of this item consists of expenditure on departmentaladministration and environmental research, most of the remainder beingexpenditure on Sports Councils, the Nature Conservancy Council and the countryside Commissions.:

1. Table 2.9 includes expenditure on four separate groups of services:the administration of justice; the treatment of offenders including the detention of persons remanded in custody and of offenders serving sentences,the provision of after-care for released offenders and various non-custodialpenalties available to the courts; services concerned with the protectionof people and property namely the police and fire services, civil defence and the control of immigration; the development of good community rela-tions, including provision for the urban programme, and grants towardscertain voluntary services. About three-quarters of the expenditure is in-curred initially by local authorities on services to which the Governmentcontributes by way of specific grants and rate support grant, and centralgovernment expenditure accounts for the balance. Nearly all expenditurein the programme is on goods and services. Almost all of the centralgovernment expenditure in this programme is cash limited, the significantexceptions being payments for legal aid and criminal injury compensation.For local authority expenditure the programme is subject to cash limitsimposed on local authority borrowing and on rate support grant, but current expenditure on services which attract specific grants is not cash limited.Administration of justiceCourt Services:  England and Wales-Magistrates&apos; Courts and Coroners&apos; Courts2. Current expenditure in magistrates&apos; courts has increased in recentyears largely because the total number of criminal cases (which form thegreater part of the business they handle) has risen, as has the proportionof proceedings for indictable offences, which constitute the more serious and therefore more time-consuming cases. The expenditure is currentlyrunning at just under  50 million a year. However, receipts of fines andfees in these courts (not taken into account in table 2.9) slightly exceed the running costs, and in addition their work produces savings for the supplementary Benefits Commission through the enforcement of mainten-ance orders. The total number of persons proceeded against in magistrates&apos;courts for criminal offences rose from 1.8 million in 1971 to 2.1 million in1975. Of these, 350,000 in 1971 and 439,000 in 1975 were proceeded againstfor indictable offences. The total figure in 1980 may be around 2.3 million.The capital expenditure allocation will permit the completion of new courthouses already under construction in the current year, but from 1977-78onwards only essential minor works can be approved before 1980-81 when a very small resumption of new work may be possible.3. Provision for costs ordered to be paid out of central funds bymagistrates&apos; courts etc is estimated to rise from  14 million to  16 million over the period, in line with a probable rise in the number of cases.Higher Courts4. The estimates reflect a substantial rise in criminal and civil business. Thenumber of criminal cases committed for trial is expected to rise from 53,000in 1976-77 to 64,000 in 1980-81. The cost of dealing with these extra numbers
will be greater than the estimates made in Cmnd 6393; the extra amountsneeded will be found by making postponements in the higher court building programme. The reductions in public expenditure announced by the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer in December included a reduction of  2 million on the purchase of sites for court buildings, and  3 million on courtbuilding in 1977-78, and  10 million on court building in 1978-79.5. The current expenditure on civil business is largely offset by courtfees.Legal aid. The scope of the legal aid, advice and assistance scheme is fixed by legislation so that the level of expenditure is related very largely to thenumber of eligible applicants.7. The restriction on legal aid in undefended divorce cases is expectedto make savings sufficient to keep the total expenditure on civil legal aid and the legal advice and assistance scheme within the forecasts in Cmnd6393. It is also hoped that some resources will be released to allow for improvements in legal services. Expenditure on legal advice and assistance will show an immediate increase as a result of the restriction on legal aid, butthereafter is expected to continue increasing by about 10 per cent a year over the five year period.8. Expenditure on criminal legal aid is expected to rise about 9 per cent a year in the magistrates&apos; courts and 7 per cent a year in higher courts, in line with the expected rise in criminal proceedings. Consideration is being given to ways of reducing the rate of increase in this expenditure.1Court Services Scotland9. Capital expenditure on sheriff court buildings is now expected torise over the period from just under  1 million in 1977-78 to a provisionalfigure of just over  3 million in 1980-81. This will allow for only theessential needs of renovation and new building, including the new GlasgowSheriff Court House. Current expenditure reflects the increasing trend of court business generally and makes provision for additional expenditure as a result of divorce legislation.Legal Aid10. Total expenditure on legal aid, advice and assistance in Scotland isexpected to rise from  5 million in 1976-77 to  6 million in 1980-81.Expenditure for civil legal aid is expected to remain fairly constant overthe period but expenditure for criminal legal aid and for legal advice and assistance is expected to rise by 8 per cent and 5 per cent a year respectively.Consideration is, however, being given to ways of reducing this rate of increase in expenditure.
11. Payments by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board continue torise in response to increases in the number of applicants; possible changesin the scheme to reduce the increase in expenditure are being considered.More detailed information is contained in the 12th Report of the Board(Cmnd 6656).Treatment of offendersPrisons12. The main assumption is that the average number of persons held in custody will rise from 46,200 in 1976-77 to 48,100 by 1980-81, althoughthat estimate depends in part on the use made of non-custodial measures.Average numbers do not indicate the maximum numbers the prison systemmay have to hold at any given time, which could be about 1,700 more.The forecast provides for the completion of existing projects which will produce about 4,750 inmate places during the period; but after 1977-78capital expenditure will decline sharply. Current expenditure estimates take account of revenue from prison industries and farms which is now estimated to rise from about  10 million to  19 million over the period.Because of constraints on expenditure, there will be some decline in theconditions of prison life and the state of buildings.13. The table on pages 66 and 67 provides a simple framework withinwhich the allocation of resources may be related to their planned use andtheir projected outputs. Other information of a non-financial character is published in the annual reports on the work of the Prison Services andParole Boards.Probation and After-Care England and Wales14. The estimates assume a lower rate of increase in staff than was envisaged in Cmnd 6393. The number of probation officers (excludingofficers seconded to Prison Department establishments) is expected to rise from 4,700 to 5,025 over the period. The provision for probation and after-care may allow some extension of community service schemes, particularly if existing resources are redeployed, but the rate of growth of places inadult probation and bail hostels will be reduced to provide 1,200 overthe period and not 1,600 as was envisaged in Cmnd 6393; the reduction will fall on probation rather than bail places. The day training scheme is notto be expanded for the time being. The programme allows for an increasein grant-aided after-care hostel places provided by voluntary bodies from ,000 at 1 April 1976 to 2,720 at 1 April 1979 with no increase thereafter.15. A report by the Home Office on the work of the Probation and After-Care Department for the years 1972-75 was published in Cmnd 6590.16. In Scotland, probation and after-care are provided for in the health and personal social services programme (programme 11).
General protective servicesPolice17. It was assumed in Cmnd 6393 that the number of police officers would rise from 119,300 on 31 March 1976 to 124,650 on 31 March 1980.A continued improvement in recruiting means that it is now expectedthat the number of policemen in post will rise from 120,300 to 127,150over the period; even with these increases police strength would in some areas remain below authorised establishment which totals 130,150. Shouldnumbers exceed the estimated growth, provision will be made for additional expenditure within authorised establishments.18. Provision will be made for the Police Complaints Board to start in1977.19. The number of civilians, including traffic wardens and cadets,employed for police purposes will be reduced over the period from 49,200to 42,700, which is a much sharper reduction than was assumed in Cmnd6393.20. Compared with Cmnd 6393, the estimates for capital expenditure onsites and operational buildings have been further reduced over the periodbut starts will be made on two new headquarters and other operationalbuildings. Provision is made for two new enlarged forensic sciencelaboratories to replace four existing ones, and for the essential redevelop-ment of training establishments.21. Other non-financial information is published in the annual report ofHM Chief Inspectors of Constabulary and of the Commissioner of Policefor the Metropolis.Fire Services22. The forecast assumes that numbers of whole time firemen will bereduced to 36,300 during 1977 and then remain at that level; the numbersof part-time and junior firemen and of civilian staff will be about 16,200and 5,800 respectively throughout the period.23. There will be continuing reductions over the period in the current expenditure on fire research and on the central training establishments.The capital expenditure figures allow for a very limited building programme.Other non-financial information is published in the annual reports ofHM Chief Inspectors of Fire Services.Community services24. Provision is made for financing the Equal Opportunities Commissionand the new Commission for Racial Equality which will replace the race relations Board and Community Relations Commission. Provision is also made for the Urban Programme and for grants to voluntary bodies.

1. All but some 3 to 4 per cent of the total programme is expenditureon education and libraries. This expenditure is expected to decline from 7,200 million in 1976-77 to  6,870 million in 1978-79. Thereafter the figures are provisional. They reflect an expected increase in demand for higherand further education and the effects of a falling school population. Overfour-fifths of the expenditure on this programme is incurred by local educa-tion authorities, nearly all of which is classified expenditure on goods and services (the treatment of the subsidy on school meals is dealt with inparagraph 10). Taking the programme as a whole, central government expenditure comprises mainly grants and grants in aid to the universities and students and to research and other councils. With the major exceptionof grants to students, the programme is directly cash limited or subjectto cash limits imposed on local authority borrowing and on rate support grant.Education and librariesGeneral2. The expenditure forecasts in table 2.10 above are related to thepupil, student and teacher numbers set out in the tables in paragraph and 12 below. They will be sufficient to sustain the Governments policyof meeting the levels of educational demand now expected, though this maywell be at the expense of some existing standards of provision.3. The expenditure forecasts take account of changes in prospectivedemand compared with the projections underlying Cmnd 6393. these changes have been accommodated within the limits imposed by the Govern-menfs strategy for containing public expenditure as a whole. Whereas the projected number of births continues to fall, the number of young peopleseeking to continue their education beyond the statutory age in schoolsor in colleges of further education has been increasing more rapidly than previously expected, a trend possibly influenced by current economic circumstances. In 1975-76, the number of students in non-advanced further education was 769,000, an increase of 48,000 on the corresponding figure in Cmnd 6393.4. The expenditure forecasts for administration show a reduction in the previously projected levels of central and local authority expenditure.5. The forecasts of current expenditure for 1977-78 in table 2.10 take account of the rate support grant settlements for that year and of themeasures announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 15 December1976. For England and Wales the implications of these decisions for thelocal authority education service have been set out in circulars to localauthorities (Joint Circulars DES 14/76 and 15/76).Schools6. The table below shows the expected number of pupils at all levels,participation rates and teaching staff numbers.

For England and Wales the Governments policy is to maintain staffing standards in schools at their 1976-77 levels (see para. 9). Pupil/teacher ratios derived from the data in this table would not quite represent the ratios in schools because the projected numbers of teachersallow for the developing programmes of in-service and induction training2. Pupil numbers are as at January calculated on an institutional basis.3. Numbers for &quot;Under fives&quot; are expressed as full-time equivalents and the participationrates express these as a percentage of 3 and 4 year olds in the population.4. As some Primary Schools contain nursery classes for under fives the breakdown of staff numbers for these categories has been estimated from 1974 onwards.5. The table relates to maintained nursery, primary and secondary schools only.6. The Urban Programme has not been included.7. The &quot;Secondary over school leaving age&quot; participation rate is expressed as a percentageof 16 and 17 year olds in the population and is therefore not a measure of &quot;staying on&quot; rate.8. Post 1974 school leaving age has been used for all Secondary calculations.7. Because of declining numbers in the age groups, provisions for the under fives in school will cater for increasing proportions of 3 and 4 yearolds, within a steady total number of places. Capital expenditure for the under fives, though substantially less than in recent years, should enableadditional specialised accommodation to be provided in areas of greatestsocial deprivation.8. Pupil numbers in primary and secondary schools are expected to fall by nearly 700,000 between 1976 and 1981. The decline in primarynumbers, already under way, will accelerate. Secondary pupil numbers areexpected to fall after reaching a peak in 1978-79. However, the rising trendfor pupils voluntarily to pursue their education beyond the minimum leaving age is expected to continue and develop. Capital expenditure on school building will continue to provide for new school places required as aresult of the movement of population and should make possible modest
programmes for the construction of special schools and for the replacement of very poor school premises.9. In England and Wales, provision has been made for staffing sufficientto maintain the standards obtaining in 1976-77; and from 1977-78 for the gradual expansion of in-service training and beginning of induction training for newly trained teachers. In Scotland, the programme provides for themaintenance of the standards agreed with the Convention of Scottish LocalAuthorities for 1976-77 and promulgated in Scottish Office Finance CircularNo. 64/1975.School meals and milk10. Over the last ten years, the number of meals served daily hasincreased from 5.2 million to 6.8 million. The total cost of the school meals service now stands at  547 million of which free school meals forpupils and adults account for  119 million  144 million is recovered in charges. In addition to the intention announced in Cmnd 6393 to halvethe 1975-76 level of subsidy 63 per cent on average by 1980, the Govern-ment intends to secure further savings by economies in the operation ofthe school meals service and is undertaking consultations on how best to achieve them, without reducing the nutritional value of the meal oraffecting the arrangements for remitting the charge to pupils in cases of hardship. The previously proposed increase from 15p to 20p in the charge for the school dinner was deferred from September 1976. As announced on 22 July 1976, the charge will now be raised to 25p at the beginningof the 1977-78 school year.11. The Government will defer for the time being taking powers underthe Education Acts, 1976 to enable local authorities to provide milkotherwise than as prescribed in the Education (Milk) Act, 1971.Higher and further education12. The forecasts of expenditure for higher and further education are based on the following projections of student numbers:Thousands1976-77    1977-78    1978-79    1979-80    1980-81Non-advanced further education(i)      798 816 831 850 867Higher education W) 515 519 519 522 541(!) The figures are estimated for the academic year beginning in the relevant financial yearand are expressed as full-time equivalents of students undertaking non-advanced level work at establishments of further education, including evening institutes.(2) The figures are estimated for the academic year beginning in the relevant financial year.They take into account full-time and sandwich students undertaking advanced level work at universities (throughout Great Britain) and polytechnics and other establishments of further education. Part-time students in advanced further education have been excluded.(3) The assumption is that there will be 560,000 Higher Education students in 1981-82.13. The projections of student numbers in paragraph 12, and the expen-diture forecasts in table 2.10 are generally consistent with the policiesset out in the last White Paper, Cmnd 6393. In addition they take accountof the recommended increases in the levels of tuition fees for home and
overseas students in the 1977-78 academic year announced in November1976 and of the effect of those increases and the proposed limitation ofthe number of overseas students on the future demand for places. for home students, it is assumed that the proportions of the post-school age groups entering higher and further education will continue to rise. the division of the projected student numbers in higher education between different kinds of institution is under discussion with the bodies concerned.The forecasts of current expenditure provide for no increase in the totalnumber of academic staff; and a more intensive use of other resources willbe required. There will be continuing severe restrictions on capitalexpenditure of all kinds.Libraries14. The forecasts allow for a small annual increase in local authorities&apos;current expediture on local libraries. The provision in 1979-80 and 1980-81would be sufficient to permit a start on the new building for the BritishLibrary at Somers Town.Science15. The Science Budget was allocated in 1976-77 Estimates as follows:  millionAgricultural Research Council (ARC)	18.3Medical Research Council (MRC)	37.4Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)	26.0Science Research Council (SRC)	117.2Social Science Research Council (SSRC)	11.2Natural History Museum	3.8Royal Society	2.0	215.916. The purpose of the research financed from the Science Budget is todevelop the sciences as such, to maintain a fundamental capacity for research, and to support higher education. The Research Councils carryout these functions by a variety of means, the pattern of which differs from one Council to another, and which broadly comprises the following:making grants to research workers in universities and elsewhere, whichmay include capital provision; entering into contracts with universities andother bodies whereby the Councils pay the full cost including overheads ofthe research which they initiate; providing and maintaining their ownresearch establishments, which may take the form of units associated withuniversities, or central facilities for the common use of universities, orseparate institutes which carry out research programmes agreed by theCouncil; participating in the activities of international scientific organisa-tions; and providing support for postgraduate training. The general pattern of each CounciPs expenditure in 1976-77 financed from the Science budget is as follows:
  million	ARC	MRC	NERC	SRC	SSRC	TotalResearch grants and contracts ...	1-5	110	2-2	26-6	4-1	45-4Research units and establishments	6-8	20-6	17-0	40-8	0-7	85-9Research   Council   grant-aided institutes        .........	9-1	00	20	00	00	11-1Postgraduate awards     ......	01	2-5	1-9	11-8	50	21-3International subscriptions	00	1-1	00	31-5	00	32.6Centrally supported schemes and administration.........	0-8	2-2	2-9	6-5	1-4	13-8Total	18-3	37-4	260	117-2	11-2	2101Expenditure by the Natural History Museum and the Royal Society ( 5-8 million) is excluded.17. In addition to research financed from the Science Budget, the research Councils carry out research commissioned by government depart-ments. The value of this research as provided for in the 1976-77 estimateswas  44.6 million.18. The projected level of the Science Budget reflects the reductionsannounced in July and December 1976 in the figures shown for 1977-78and 1978-79 in Cmnd 6393. An addition has, however, been made to allow for the increased level of post-graduate tuition fees in 1977-78 and later years; and provision for institutions of higher education has beencorrespondingly reduced. In accordance with the advice of the advisory board for the Research Councils, the resources devoted by the SRC to&quot;big science&quot; (high energy physics, astronomy and space science) will bereduced by about 25 per cent over the survey period, so as to preservescope for initiatives by the SRC in other fields (which include engineering)and by the other Councils.Arts19. The planned current expenditure on the national museums and galleries in 1977-78 allows for the staffing of buildings now under construc-tion, including the Industrial and Maritime Museum in Wales. For 1978-79and later years reductions in the staff complements at the Victoria andAlbert and Science Museums result from the decision to reduce civilservice manpower generally. For the other institutions, current expenditure will be maintained at the existing level. Some planned building projectswill be deferred as capital provision in 1977-78 and later years is reduced.The local authority programme for Scotland includes provision for thebuilding of a gallery to house the Burrell Collection.20. Details of the activities supported by the Arts Council and of thework of the British Film Institute are given in their Annual Reports. Capital
provision for housing the arts has been reduced in 1977-78 and following years. In the light of the further review referred to in Cmnd 6393, page 90,paragraph 19, and of other factors, the planned provision for the artsallows for the expenditure arising from the completion of the national theatre building and its continued use, the immediate requirements ofthe National Film Archive, and the continuation at broadly their present level of other grants for current expenses.

Apart from the provision for expenditure on the personal social services by local authorities, this programme consists wholly of expenditure by central government, undertaken mainly through the health authoritiesand family practitioner committees. Expenditure on this programme isattributed to spending on goods and services. Expenditure is shown netof various charges (such as prescription charges) described more fully below.National Health Service contributions, which amount to about  649 million a year at present, are not netted off expenditure. With the major exceptionof the family practitioner services the whole of the programme is either directly cash limited or is subject to cash limits imposed on local authorityborrowing and on rate support grant.

Expenditure on the training of physiotherapistshas been transferred from the education programme, and a transfer hasbeen made to the social security programme to take account of the gradualreplacement of invalid tricycles by the mobility allowance.The services provided3.

As in many other countries, the demand for nearly all these services in Great Britain is increasing steadily year by year. One of the main reasonsfor this is the changing structure of the population, especially the increasing proportion of elderly people. Older people see the doctor more often, are more frequently admitted to hospital, stay in hospital longer and make muchheavier demands on residential, domiciliary and day care services. On theother hand, with a lower birth rate there should be some compensatingoffsets.

A second important reason for the increase in demand is thatmedical and scientific research into ways of improving and developingtechniques of health care continues to produce new drugs and equipment,and new forms of treatment which may bring great benefits, for instancehip replacements for old people. This leads to an increase in the number of patients treated and in some instances increasing costs per case.7. Better medical treatment and improved management may lead tosome offsetting savings. For instance more effective ways of treating the mentally ill have increased the cost per inpatient week but secured a bigreduction in the number of patients requiring long term inpatient care.
Progress has also been made towards the more efficient use of hospitalbeds in the general acute specialties and in geriatric medicine. As can beseen from the first table, there has been a gradual decline in the numberof beds, but the number of cases per bed has increased and length of stayhas decreased.8. The decrease in average length of stay has not however led to adecrease in costs per case; these have risen steadily in real terms. Contributoryfactors include new methods of treatment, as noted above, higher standards in some cases and, again, the higher proportion of very elderly patientswho need more care whilst in hospital. To sum up, the picture in the hospital service generally is of fewer beds but more cases per bed (especially old people) and higher costs per case.9. There has in recent years been an increasing emphasis on the objective, which the Government has strongly encouraged, of providingmore care in the community, and reserving hospitals for those who needtheir full facilities. An indication of the progress which has already beenmade can be seen in the first table.Planned Expenditure up to 1980-8110. In general, the programme provides for the continuation of the policy set out in Cmnd 6393 that existing standards of service should be maintained,taking account of the increasing numbers of old people, and of children incare. In accordance with this policy the figures for current expenditure onhospital and community health, family practitioner and local authoritypersonal social services in 1980-81 are subject to increase if the presentdemographic projections are confirmed. As in the case of other pro-grammes, however, all the figures for 1979-80 and 1980-81 are entirelyprovisional at this stage.Hospital and community health services11. Apart from some small adjustments, gross current expenditure onthese services is planned to increase as in Cmnd 6393 up to 1979-80. Forthe country as a whole, this should be adequate to maintain standards of care for the growing number of old people, and leave a very small marginfor other demands on the service such as the introduction of new methodsof treatment and the gradual implementation of health and safety legislation.Beyond this improvements in service can only be financed by redeployingresources released by economies and increased efficiency within the hospital and community health services themselves. The need to make the best useof limited resources underlines the importance of the planning arrangements now being introduced covering both the Health Departments and the NHS.Measures are being taken to limit management costs in the NHS.12. As a result of the measures announced in July and December 1976and other changes since the last White Paper, the capital programme forthese services has been reduced by  26 million in 1977-78 and 21 million in1978-79. This will delay starts on many new projects including health centres, but schemes already under construction will continue. In later years the programme is provisionally set at about the same level as in Cmnd 6393.
13. The report of the resource allocation working party &quot;Sharingresources for health in England&quot; recommended methods of securing a moreequitable distribution of the available current and capital resources betweenregional health authorities and also between areas and districts. Followingconsultation with health authorities and other interested parties, it has beendecided that in 1977-78 there will be some progress in the redistribution of resources, with the best provided regions getting an increase of \ per cent and the most deprived regions about 3 per cent. In Scotland the working party on revenue resources allocation has issued an interim report making recommendations for 1977-78 only. As a first step it is proposed to change the method of allocation for community health services revenue. similar action has been taken in Wales to identify methods for ensuring that revenuedistribution to health authorities is made in the light of criteria of relativeneed. The Welsh working group on resources allocation has producedreports in 1974 and 1975 containing recommendations concerning revisionto the allocations on this subject and this work is being continued in 1976.In all three countries the rate of progress towards more equitable distributionwill be constrained by the overall resources available and must also be related to the speed with which health authorities can, on the one hand, realisticallyredeploy services and secure economies while safeguarding important and developing services, and on the other, effectively make use of additional resources.Family practitioner services14. Primary health care is provided by practitioners taking part in thegeneral medical, dental and ophthalmic services, and the pharmaceuticalservices. Charges are made for dental treatment, spectacles, and drugs,except for certain exempt groups such as children, those with low income and (in the case of drugs) the elderly. No charge is made for GP consulta-tions, dental examinations or sight tests. Up to 1979-80 the programme isbased upon the latest estimates of the use which will be made of the range of services offered and also of the increasing numbers of practitioners. the forecasts for 1977-78 onwards take account of measures to be taken to helpoffset the increase in the cost of the family practitioner services: these measures include increases in dental and ophthalmic charges, reductions inthe allowance for promotion costs in determining the price of drugs andother economies in the drugs bill. The following table shows current expenditure and charges in 1975-76 and the estimated position in 1977-78.  million at 1976 Survey prices	1975-76			1977-78			Gross	Charges	Net	Gross	Charges	NetGeneral medical services	333-2		333-2	359-6		359-general dental services......	228-4	43-1	185-3	235-8	59-5	176-general ophthalmic services	69-3	25-5	43-8	66-3	27-7	38-6Pharmaceutical services......	491-8	30-7	461-1	547-3	26-6	520-7Totals      ............	1122-7	99-3	1023-4	1209 0	113-8	1095-2
Personal social services15. Current expenditure on personal social services covers the running costs of residential homes and day care centres, and of field social workand domiciliary services, including aids for the disabled. It also coversprobation and after care in Scotland. The personal social services have grown rapidly in recent years, from a small base. The limits set for them in cmnd 6393 seem likely to be exceeded in 1976-77, partly because ofunavoidable increases in the costs of residential and day care, and expenditurein this year may approach the level originally planned for 1977-78. However,allowance has been made for this within the Government^ overall spendingplans as has been more fully explained in Part 1.16. To help ease the constraint, therefore, in England and Wales  million has been transferred from capital to current expenditure in 1977-78and 1978-79, and  9 million from 1979-80 onwards; the position after1977-78 will be reviewed in the light of experience. This will help to givea very small margin for increased current expenditure in 1977-78. It will alsoreduce the revenue consequences of the capital programme in later years.Joint financing arrangements are being reviewed to see whether they can he made more flexible. The provision now being made should enable localauthorities to protect field and domiciliary services and the most urgently needed residential accommodation and day care. The extent to whichservices can meet demographic pressures and maintain standards will dependcritically on the success that authorities have in devising effective but lesscostly alternatives to some services, finding more efficient ways of deliveringothers and rigorously ordering their priorities. In addition to the virementalready mentioned, capital expenditure has been cut by about  3 million in1977-78 and 1978-79. The level of capital expenditure now planned means a further reduction in the number of new residential and day care projects.17. In Scotland, apart from minor cuts in 1977-78 and 1978-79, thecapital programme is maintained at the levels planned in Cmnd 6393. no decision has yet been taken on the introduction of joint financing arrange-ments. In view of the varying needs of different areas, local authorities willhave to decide on the most appropriate methods of effecting economies,while protecting essential services.Centrally financed services18. In 1977-78 expenditure on centrally financed services has beenreduced by  5 million through savings in buildings, research and training.Economies are being made in the running and staffing costs of the health departments as part of the reduction in civil service costs generally.

Apart from provision (net of the associated reduction in child tax allowances) for the first stage of the new child benefit scheme from April1977, the general pattern of expenditure on the various social security benefits, which is entirely central government expenditure has not alteredfrom that shown in Cmnd 6393. Retirement pensions account for about halfthe total programme expenditure, and other contributory benefits for between a fifth and a quarter. The balance is made up by the non-contributory benefits, principally supplementary benefit. Contributions by employers andinsured persons are at present equivalent to just over two-thirds of totalexpenditure in this programme. The only expenditure in this programmethat is subject to cash limits is that on administration and miscellaneousservices.

Expenditure in future years is expressed in terms of the average level of benefit during 1976-77, which amounts to assuming that benefits are increased from year to year at the same rate as prices. On thispresentation, differences from year to year in the cost of these benefitsreflect demographic and other changes affecting the number of beneficiaries;from 1977-78 they also include the net exchequer cost of the first phase of child benefit.3. Expenditure on this programme is determined by the number ofbeneficiaries and the rates of benefit; both these factors depend on thecourse of the economy. Numbers will be affected by the level of unemploy-ment (as well as demographic factors). The rates of benefit will increase in

This increase restored therelativity between average gross earnings and the prescribed limits to that existing in 1971 when the family income supplement scheme was introduced,and enables families getting the supplement who have received the  6 payrise to continue to be entitled to the benefit when their current awardsexpire.6. Invalid care allowance, a benefit for those other than marriedwomen living with or maintained by their husbands who are prevented from going out to work by the need to look after a disabled person whoreceives attendance allowance, was introduced in July 1976. The gross cost,included in table 2.12 is  7 million in 1977-78, but the net cost, after offsetting savings on supplementary benefit, is estimated to be about  1 billion.7. Child benefit will be paid from April 1977 at the rate of  1 forthe first child (except for one parent families who will get  1.50) and 1.50 for every other child. It will replace the existing family allowance and child interim benefit schemes, and by providing for the first time a cash benefit for every child, the number of children catered for will bedoubled. The new benefit will be tax free, but child tax allowances will bereduced by  104 for the first child and  130 for other children. As a result,the net exchequer cost of the new child benefit scheme will be less than thevalue of the gross child benefit payments, and it is this net cost which is included in the programme totals. This is the first step in phasing ina scheme which will provide a new structure for family support, replacing
existing child tax allowances which go to the father with a cash benefitpayable to the mother. It will also mean the poorest families, who do not getthe full benefit of child tax allowances (and in some cases no benefit at all)will get as much support for their children as other families. The Governmentare committed to replacing the tax allowance for children under 11, andan equivalent part of those for older children, with child benefit by April1979. This will be done in three steps starting in April 1977, but the preciseamount to be converted from tax allowance to benefit in the years 1978-79and 1979-80 has yet to be settled. The remaining child tax allowances forolder children will go as soon as possible thereafter.-

Rather more than half the remainder is attributable to local authorities. The capital expenditure of the broadcasting authorities and Cable and Wireless Limited accounts for most of the rest.Nearly all the expenditure is on goods and services and is shown net ofsundry fees, such as land registry fees. The bulk of expenditure on this programme is cash limited.Functioning of Parliament and the Privy council. This includes payments from the Consolidated Fund for the Queen&apos;civil List and other members of the Royal Family, Royal Household and civil List pensions and, from 1976-77, a supplementary grant from theTreasury Vote.Parliamentary election expenses3. The forecast covers only by-election expenditure and the replacement of election equipment etc; it does not include provision for the costs of thegeneral election which must take place not later than October 1979.Tax and rate collection4. More than half the total is for the Revenue Departments. Theremainder is for the Department of Health and Social Security, Departmentof Transport, the Property Services Agency and local authorities.5. The Revenue departments&apos; expenditure consists almost entirely ofwages, salaries and related administrative expenditure incurred in the performance of their statutory duties. Additional demands have been made
(Scotland) Land Registry, Ordnance Survey, and other minor departments)and some local authority expenditure. Provision is made under the Officeof Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) for social surveys carried out as an allied service for government departments.9. The provision for the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys andGeneral Register Office (Scotland) takes into account estimated receipts eachyear of  1 million for the issue of birth, death and marriage certificates,and extracts from the central records. The predicted level of these receiptsis uncertain as the demand for services (copies of certificates and verifica-tions) dropped significantly in the past year after fees were increased andhas not yet stabilised. The number of services in OPCS fell from 302,000in 1975-76 to an estimated 200,000 in 1976-77. The provision also includes the estimated cost of the preliminary work for a 100 per cent census of population in 1981.10. Although the revision by the Ordnance Survey of the basic survey for Great Britain will be completed by 1980, the effect of the manpower and financial reductions on the Ordnance Survey will be a generaldiminution of work. Net expenditure is now expected to fall from  11million in 1976-77 to  8 million in 1980-81 this is a slower decline than previously expected because of a reduction in forecast receipts.Broadcasting11. The programme covers the capital expenditure of the BBC HomeServices and IBA. The provision allows for phases I and II of the ultra highfrequency (UHF) 625-line television transmitter building programme,replacement of worn out plant and, in the case of BBC Home Services, re-arrangement of radio frequency assignments, provision of sound broadcastingof Parliamentary proceedings and refurbishing existing studio facilities andstudio development. The BBCs expenditure (capital and current) is financed by government grant which at present consists of the whole of the netlicence revenue. The IBA is financed by rentals charged to the independent television and local radio companies.Other services12. The largest single item in this category is the capital expenditure programme of Cable &amp; Wireless Limited. The company, whose sharesare wholly owned by the Government, is profitable and has consistently paid a dividend. Its principal activity is the provision of international communica-tion and internal telephone systems in a number of countries and it is animportant link in the Commonwealth telecommunications network. because in the long term countries are likely to take over the running of their ownsystems, the Company is diversifying into related activities. The approvedinvestment programme allows for newly identified potentially profitableprojects in the first two years and the likelihood of further investmentopportunities in the later part of the period. The higher level of investmentwill not make any call on government funds. The company&apos;s investment is largely financed from its own internal resources, with any residue being made
up by loans from non-governmental sources since it has no access to theNational Loans Fund.13. The figures also include the salaries, etc and general expenses of theOffice of the Parliamentary Commissioner and Health Service Commissioners.Devolution14. The only expenditure included in this programme covering theadditional costs of devolution is the expenditure on accommodation for theScottish and Welsh Assemblies announced by the Lord President of theCouncil on 14 April 1976. Other expenditure is being treated as a knownclaim on the contingency reserve. (Estimates of the additional costs of devolution are included in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum tothe Scotland and Wales Bill.)

With the major exceptions of civil superannuation and rates on government property, expenditure on this programme is cash limited.Office and general accommodation services . The expenditure mainly covers the construction, leasing, furnishing andmaintenance of government offices, and is largely determined therefore bythe area required to house the Home Civil Service.

The amount of space leased is therefore expected to growuntil 1978. The Crown-owned estate will also increase with completion ofnew buildings outside London, but this will be offset by reductions in later years in leased accommodation.3. As part of the cuts on public expenditure announced on 15 December1976, new construction projects have in general been deferred by 12 months,with consequential reductions in capital expenditure in 1977-78 and 1978-79.Following earlier cuts, an increased proportion of the capital expenditurein later years will be on new Crown buildings, mainly in the assisted areas,to accommodate civil service posts dispersed from London under theGovernments dispersal programme announced in July 1974. The completionof Crown buildings already under construction is expected to produce agradually declining rent bill at constant prices after 1978, although themain effects of dispersal on rents will be felt after 1981. Survey prices forrent make allowances for changes in the size of the estate but not forrent increases (the rents of many existing leases due for renewal orreplacement in the survey period are well below current market levels).4. Cuts have also been made in maintenance and other running costs,and these will in future fall below the current level despite the increasedsize of the estate. The level of administration costs will also fall as partof the planned reduction in the planned costs of the civil service.5. The expenditure in this programme is shown net of certain receipts mainly recovery of the cost of accommodation occupied by civil servants
who administer the National Insurance Fund, and of the departmentaladministration costs of works services for repayment customers, chieflythe Post Office. In 1975-76 these receipts were  23 million and  30million respectively, and other receipts of  3 million, mainly from disposals,were also netted off expenditure. In addition, repayment bodies occupyingpart of the estate pay PSA rent and service charges ( 21 million in 1975-76);these particular receipts are not deducted from the expenditure figures inthe table.Stationery and printing (home)6. HMSO is the central source of supply for government departments for their printing, stationery and office machinery, and is responsible for publication, distribution and sale of most government publications. it also supplies some other public sector bodies on repayment. The estimates in the table represent the gross expenditure less receipts from all sources and these receipts are expected to increase from  70 million in 1975-76to  82 million in 1980-81. There have been reductions in plannedexpenditure which will necessitate continuing economies in the use ofHMSO&apos;s services by all government departments.Computers and telecommunications7. This programme covers expenditure on the purchase, hire andmaintenance of computer equipment for government administrativepurposes, and the hire of processing time from commercial bureaux. it also includes expenditure on associated development studies and the costs of the Central Computer Agency (CCA). The programme is designed to achieve economies and increase efficiency in departmental administration.The implications of the figures are that a number of projects with the lowestpriority will have to be deferred or cancelled. Some expenditure by the CCAon telecommunications for government administrative purposes is also included, but the major part of such expenditure is included on other programmes.Home publicity8. This covers expenditure on publicity campaigns which are carriedout by the Central Office of Information and Scottish Office for other government departments, and includes the related printing costs on HMSO&apos;sVote. Publicity is directed principally at audiences in the United Kingdomthrough the media of press and television advertising, films, and exhibitionsand publications in support of departmental policies. The survey figuresimply economies in the publicity programmes for all departments includingthe major continuing campaigns. Net expenditure will decline from  18million in 1976-77 to  15 million in 1980-81.Civil superannuation9. This programme covers expenditure on the pensions, lump sumbenefits and other superannuation benefits (including transfer payments to other schemes) payable to civil servants and their dependants, offset by contributions payable by certain funds and organisations and by civil
servants towards the cost of widows&apos; pensions, transfer payments receivedfrom other schemes and certain other receipts. The figures reflect a larger number of retirements in 1976-77 than originally expected, and the latest estimates of retirements in the subsequent years. Provision has also beenmade in 1975-76 and 1976-77 for payments in respect of accrued pension rights of civil servants transferred to the Civil Aviation Authority.Other common services10. This programme covers the costs of legal services, the government actuary, civil service catering services and transport services.

More than three quarters of expenditure on this programme is centralgovernment spending divided between goods and services (the greaterpart) and public transfer payments. The remaining expenditure is dividedfairly equally between local authorities and other public corporations, and almost entirely consists of spending on goods and services. Expenditure isshown net of a small amount of charges, broadly comparable to thosededucted from the corresponding programmes for Great Britain. For cashlimits coverage of Northern Ireland departments&apos; services is broadlyanalogous to coverage of comparable services in Great Britain.2. Table 2.15 shows the division of Northern Ireland expenditure be-tween Northern Ireland departments and United Kingdom departments.It does not include (i) the cost of food subsidies and price guarantees for milk and wool which appear for the United Kingdom as a whole in table2.3 (Northern Ireland&apos;s share of this in 1976-77 is about  17 million reduc-ing to about  2 million in 1977-78); (ii) expenditure by the InterventionBoard for Agricultural Produce on market regulation operations to imple-ment the Common Agricultural Policy in the United Kingdom as a whole(also in table 2.3); and (iii) extra costs attributable to the army&apos;s task

In line with the rest of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland hashad to bear a share of the reductions in public expenditure announced bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer on 22 July and 15 December 1976, andthe figures reflect this. On the other hand Northern Ireland, in common with the rest of the United Kingdom, has benefited from allocations underthe unemployment relief measures announced in December 1975, and february, April, August and September 1976. The total allocations to northern Ireland under these measures is about  13 million, falling mainly in the years 1976-77 and 1977-78.4. Inevitably, overall, there will be a reduction in the level of assist-ance provided under certain schemes and a number of improvements whichwere planned in various services will not now take place. But in the main,services will continue at the level envisaged in Cmnd 6393. Emphasis con-tinues to be placed on employment and on those programmes of socialsignificance such as education, health and personal social services and par-
ticularly on housing where there is the greatest need to remedy deficienciesand improve standards. In education, existing levels of expenditure arebeing broadly maintained, while the health and personal social servicesprogramme shows growth. The requirement for increased expenditure onlaw and order reflects the Governments policy of securing the conviction of terrorists through the courts by expanding the police service and making it more effective, changing over from compounds to cellular prison accom-modation and building of a new permanent prison. Provision is also madeto cover the costs of payments of compensation for criminal injuries.5. The figures reflect the continuing efforts to preserve existing jobs in industry and agriculture, while maintaing provisions for new jobs. Never-theless, unemployment has reached a very high level (58,000 or 10.9 percent of the labour force) and, despite some signs of improvement in manu-facturing output, the amount of new industry investment in recent years to offset a high level of plant closure suggests a bleak outlook for employ-ment.6. Against this background, officials have undertaken an urgent reviewof economic and industrial strategy and have produced as a basis fordiscussion a series of strategic options. The various options are now beinglooked at in detail and it would be premature to assess the effects of the review on the various programmes.7. The continued priority being given to housing is reflected in the survey programme figures. The Northern Ireland Housing Condition Survey1974 and the Northern Ireland Household Survey revealed that nearly40 per cent of the housing stock needs to be replaced, improved or repaired;that 17 per cent of households are overcrowded; and that a great manyof the people in greatest housing need are the least able to help them-selves. The programme provides, therefore, for a house building programme which will cater for population change and additions to the number of households. It will also enable further progress to be made in replacingunfit houses, and in dealing with overcrowding. The new powers in theHousing (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 will also encourage a substantialeffort to be made by the Housing Executive, housing associations and private owners in the repair and improvement of older houses, and in arresting thedecline of the twilight areas.8. The Government is particularly concerned about those areas ofNorthern Ireland in which there are very high levels of unemploymentcompounded by social and environmental problems. It is considering how best to alleviate these problems given the present financial and other con-straints.
DEBT	1971-72	1972-73Debt interest		As in this White Paper..................	1,075	1,013National income accounts basis as used in previous White		Papers........................	4,688	4,671Changes from Cmnd 6393 revalued............		A new presentation of debt interest as part of public expenditure is intro-duced in this White Paper. It excludes from public expenditure interest pay-ments which are balanced either by receipts of interest on money lent or byprovision for interest from the profits of trading activities in which public money has been invested; and it therefore includes only debt interest whichis met by taxation or further borrowing. Where subsidies are paid on tradingactivities, as for example in the case of housing, they are included in the trading surplus (or net rent receipt) from which provision for interest is made.Interest paid out of this surplus is excluded from public expenditure in thenew presentation; but the subsidy itself is still counted as public expenditurein the appropriate programme^1)2. Estimates of public sector debt interest payment on the national income accounts basis used in previous White Papers, including all payments by public sector bodies to the private and overseas sectors, are also shownand compared with the estimates in Cmnd 6393, revalued to 1976 survey prices.3. Between 1971-72 and 1975-76 debt interest payments roughly doubledin cash terms, whether measured on the new public expenditure basis oron the national income accounts basis, though there was comparatively littleincrease in the real cost after adjusting for inflation, as shown in the tableabove. The cash increase was attributable partly to the growth in the total public sector debt, which increased in five years by  30 billion to  74 billionat the end of March 1976, and partly to the increase in interest rates. At thebeginning of this period the average rate of interest on new public sectorborrowing was around 7 per cent, and at the end nearly twice as much. Theaverage rate paid on outstanding debt rose less because of the substantial proportion borrowed at fixed rates in the past. Over this period the proportionof total interest payments which was attributable to lending and tradinginvestment fluctuated around 75 to 80 per cent, leaving 20 to 25 per cent to fall on taxation or further borrowing.4. Towards the end of this period however borrowing was increasingrapidly and a relatively small proportion of the increase was re-lent or(t) For a full explanation see the Treasury Memoranda published with the Thirteenth Reportof the Expenditure Committee (Session of 1975-76) (HC718).

Only the high rate of inflation prevented a sharp increase in the real burden of interest, and the slowing down of inflation in 1976-77 contributed substantially to the real increase in thatyear.5. Between 1975-76 and 1977-78 it is estimated that interest costs, at constant prices, will increase sharply. The interest payments included in public expenditure are estimated to increase from  1,100 million to  2,300million, while total public sector interest payments increase by  1,800million to  7,300 million. The overall increase is explained by the high levelof public sector borrowing, particularly in 1975-76 and in 1976-77, and thehigh level of interest rates in those years, assumed at the time of compila-tion to persist into 1977-78, though falling during that year. The high level of borrowing does not reflect particularly heavy public trading invest-ment and lending, but rather a growth in the government deficit in thedepressed economic conditions of recent years. Thus most of the additionalinterest payable falls on taxation and further borrowing, and is includedin public expenditure. At the same time, the rate of inflation has been falling from the 1975-76 level, and is assumed to fall considerably furtherby 1978-79; this should reduce the rate of erosion of the real burden of cash liabilities.6. As inflation rates fall, interest rates are also assumed to come down,and net borrowing, though still substantial in 1977-78 and 1978-79 inhistorical terms, will be considerably below the recent level, especially ifexpressed as a proportion of GDP. The rise in the real cost of debt interest is thus expected substantially to level out.Comparison with Cmnd 63937. The Cmnd 6393 estimate for 1975-76 was in cash terms about  150million too high. The estimates for 1976-77 and the next two years have been revised downwards, mainly on account of reduced estimates of borrowingand rather higher prices than were assumed in Cmnd 6393.
Part 3: Nationalised Industries&apos; Capital Investment and Financing1. This section gives additional information on the nationalised industries and consists of:Table 3.1  showing  the investment programmes  of  the nationalised industries; this is comparable totable 2.5 of previous White Papers;Tables 3.2 and 3.3   showing the capital requirements of the industries and how they are to be financed in 1976-77and 1977-78 respectively; andtexts commenting on the investment programme of each industry and itsfinancing figures.Reductions announced on 15 December2. The Chancellor of the Exchequers announcement on 15 Decemberof reductions in public expenditure required reductions in the nationalised industries&apos; demand on the PSBR of  110 million net in 1977-78 and  130million in 1978-79. To ensure net reductions on this scale in 1977-78,larger gross reductions were needed to offset other increases in the forecasts forthe nationalised industries. These savings, totalling  196 million, were agreed with the industries. The main elements were a gas price increase (on averageabout 10 per cent) to yield  88 million; savings on investment (by ScottishElectricity, BSC, and the Post Office) of  85 million, and a reduction ingrant to British Railways of  13 million. The consequential effects of the gas price increase and the investment savings will secure the  130 millionsaving in 1978-79. (All the figures in this paragraph, including the  88million for gas, are at 1976 survey prices).The investment programmes3. The total capital expenditure of the industries is virtually flat overthe period, but with a dip in 1977-78 as there was in Cmnd 6393. Inthe equivalent table in Cmnd 6393 no provision was made for BNOCafter 1976-77. On the same basis the total is below the Cmnd 6393 levelin each year. Even with BNOC included, the total is not significantlyabove Cmnd 6393 over the period as a whole. In most industries, andnotably electricity and telecommunications, revised estimates of demandhave resulted in lower forecasts of investment in fixed assets. The totalsreflect the reductions of  157 million in 1977-78 announced by the Chancellorof the Exchequer on 22 July, as well as the effect on capital expenditureof the action announced by the Chancellor on 15 December (see paragraph2 above). As in previous White Papers, a global deduction has been madein each year on the total of investment in fixed assets, since experience shows that overall actual expenditure turns out to be less than forecast. Theindividual industries&apos; programmes are discussed in the texts below.
Financing tables4. The financing table for 1976-1977 represents an updating of table13 of the Financial Statement and Budget Report (FSBR). The total re-quirements for grants(1), PDC and borrowing from all sources shown foreach industry (except BNOC: see paragraph 23 below) represented its cashlimit for the year. The aggregate published total was  2,965 million; it isnow forecast at  2,729 million. This total includes the capital value of assets leased by the industries. Thus overall the industries are well withinthe estimated requirements for grants, PDC and borrowing in the FSBR.The texts give details for each industry.5. The financing table for 1977-78 is, it must be stressed, a tentativeindication for individual industries of their financing requirements. Followingdiscussion with the industries of their latest available estimates, a revised and updated version of this table converted to estimated outturn prices willbe published in the FSBR in the spring and will set out the cash limitsthat will apply.Aircraft and shipbuilding6. No provision is included in public expenditure totals or in thissection for British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders, which will beestablished as nationalised industries subject to the passage of the aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill now before Parliament. It is too early to assess the amount and phasing of the financing requirements and capitalexpenditure of the two Corporations.(!) Excluding grants such as regional development grant also available to the private sector: the nationalised industries have been taken into account in estimating public expenditure on such grants in this White Paper.

Energy industriesNational Coal Board7. The investment programme provides for total expenditure on fixed assets in the period 1976-77 to 1979-80 of  1,289 million compared with 1,161 million in Cmnd 6393. This increase results mainly from revisedcosting of projects in Plan for Coal, but also from increased expenditure onprojects designed to improve efficiency and from extra provision for a con-tinuing exploration programme beyond that needed for Plan for Coal.8. The aim of Plan for Coal remains to provide 42 million tons of new capacity by 1985. The latest assessment is that this investment still offers agood rate of return on projects essential to the country&apos;s future energy need.9. The Board&apos;s capital requirements have not changed much overall sincethe publication of the FSBR in April 1976. There has, however, been a sub-stantial change in the Board&apos;s ability in 1976-77 to make a contribution from internal resources towards meeting capital requirements. This is the resultof a lower level of output and disposals, and reflects the present low demandfor energy which has had a depressing effect on the industry. The Board&apos;scapital requirement for expenditure on fixed assets is aimed, however, atmeeting energy needs in the longer term and is not affected by the poorerresults now forecast for the current year. The figure for Government grants in the FSBR was provisional. The present higher figure is attributable mainly to subsequent decisions to give stocking aid for coal, and, in the light of inflation, to increase the contribution to meeting the deficiency in the mine-workers&apos; pension scheme. The grants are scored as public expenditure inTable 2.4.Electricity10. The investment programmes for England and Wales and for theScottish Boards have been prepared in the light of the forecast made by theElectricity Council and the Scottish Electricity Boards last March that the simultaneous maximum demand would reach 60.5 thousand MW in 1982-83.This compares with the 1975 forecast given in Cmnd 6393 of 63 thousand MWin 1981-82. The latest figure represents a further reduction in electricitydemand growth consequent upon the current reduction in industrial activity,higher energy prices (in line with the Government^ objective to restore energyprices to realistic levels as soon as possible) competition from other fuels andmoves towards energy conservation.11. This level of demand, plus a 20 per cent planning margin to cover,eg the risk of plant breakdowns in cold weather when demand is at itshighest, can be met from power stations now in service and those under con-struction. By comparison with Cmnd 6393 the capital investment programmestherefore provide for a further reduction in ordering in the early part of theperiod; additionally, the steam generating heavy water reactor (SGHWR)programme has been deferred by one year. Since last year there hasbeen a corresponding revision by the Boards of the programme of expen-
diture on transmission and distribution to take account of the revisedforecasts of electricity demand growth both nationally and locally.12. The industry&apos;s borrowing requirement of  246 million for 1976-77shown in the financing table is  183 million below the sum of the separatecash limits for the industry in England and Wales, and for each of the ScottishBoards. The decrease results from a reduction in capital requirements, due in part to deferment of expenditure on SGHWR in 1976-77, and a general improvement in internal resources. The provisional figures for 1977-78 showthat this improvement in internal resources is expected to be maintained.Grants to cover the cost of the Electricity Discount Scheme and grants to theCEGB under the 1972 scheme for accelerating capital investment are scoredas public expenditure in table 2.4 as is the payment to the NSHEB towardslosses under the 1968 contract for the supply of electricity to the BritishAluminium Company at Invergordon.13. Since table 3.2 shows borrowing net, the refinancing of british electricity Stock maturing in March 1977 does not show up. The  95million which it has added to the CounciFs total funding requirement hashowever been explicity taken into account (before deducting the net foreign currency borrowings assumed for the nationalised industries) in estimating the total of net government lending to the nationalised industries.British Gas Corporation14. The bulk of the nation&apos;s gas has continued to be supplied by the fields in the Southern Basin of the North Sea which are producing at or neartheir plateau rate. The arrival of gas from the Frigg field, now expected ona regular basis from October 1977 will provide additional supplies of gasand enable the growth of the gas market to continue. Oil associated gasfrom the Brent field is now planned to come ashore towards the end of the forecast period.15. Sales in recent years and indications of possible sales in the futureare as follows:  million therms1974-75   1975-76   1976-77   1977-78   1978-79   1979-80  1980-81Domestic......     5,710      5,941      6,400      6,900      7,400      7,900      8,400Commercial ... 1,301 1,440 1,600 1,700 1,900 2,100 2,300Industrial......     5,921      6,072      6,100      6,600      7,300      7,800      8,300Total       ......    12,932     13,453     14,100     15,200     16,600     17,800     19,00016. Total sales in 1975-76 show a 4 per cent increase on the previous year with domestic and commercial markets doing slightly better than theindustrial sales.17. There are no significant changes in the industry&apos;s investment pro-gramme compared with that set out in Cmnd 6393. A rephasing of expendi-
ture largely caused by offshore delays has resulted in the reallocation ofsome items to later years. A reinforcement of the feeders from St. Fergusis planned in the latter part of the period to cope with the additional suppliesof gas from the Northern Basin.18. The financing table shows that in 1976-77 BGC is significantly belowits cash limit. This results in the main from tariff increases (on average 12.3 per cent) introduced in October 1976 which reflected changes in the PriceCode concerning the treatment of depreciation. The effect of weathercould result in a further increase in the contribution from internal resourcesby the end of the year. In 1977-78, British Gas expects to be able to financeits capital programme from internal resources and will have no requirement for either new borrowing or refinancing of the considerable amount ofloan capital being repaid, some of it early. These figures include theeffect on borrowing of the price increase (on average about 10 per cent)foreshadowed in the Chancellor of the Exchequers statement of 15 Decem-ber 1976.British National Oil Corporation19. Cmnd 6393 showed no estimates for capital expenditure from1977-78 onwards as information and policy decisions on which to baseestimates for BNOC in these years were not available.20. In March 1976 BNOC acquired the Burmah Oil Company&apos;s interestin the Ninian field, and in August a 65 per cent stake in Burmah&apos;s share in the Thistle field, and some related Burmah interests. The cost of theThistle acquisition is included in the total for 1976-77.21. Included in the total for all the years in the Survey period are esti-mates of the exploration and development expenditure arising as a result ofthe acquisition by BNOC of Burmah&apos;s share of the Ninian field, a share inBurmah&apos;s stake in the Thistle field, and of BNOC (Exploration) Ltd(formerly NCB (Exploration) Ltd).22. It is not possible at this stage to make precise estimates of BNOCspossible future expenditure requirements over and above those referred toin paragraphs 20 and 21 above, particularly those arising from its involve-ment in 5th round licences, and from any future extension into other activities. However, some provision has been made for such expenditure,particularly in the later years of the survey period.23. In 1976-77 and 1977-78 almost all of BNOCs expenditure will be incurred as a result of its contractual commitments to meet its share of costs in the North Sea consortia of which it is a member (see paragraph 21above). It is not therefore subject to a cash limit in 1976-77, and it isnot intended that it should be in 1977-78. Although BNOC is alreadyreceiving some revenue from the sales of gas, its first oil revenue willnot be received until the latter half of 1977. This means that the Corpora-tion is to contribute little from internal resources to the financing of its
capital programme in 1976-77 and 1977-78. But thereafter oil revenueswill build up fairly rapidly and there will be a substantial contribution from internal resources in the later years of the survey period.British Steel Corporation24. The British Steel Corporation^ (BSC) capital investment programme for 1976-77 to 1980-81 is intended to take the Corporation into the later stages of the Development Strategy announced in the White Paper published in February 1973 (Cmnd 5226).25. The major programme of capacity modernisation and expansion inwhich the BSC is now engaged is aimed at improving the performance ofthis crucial sector of manufacturing industry. The period will see the com-pletion of the major scheme to expand steelmaking at Ravenscraig, and of iron-making and other developments on South Teesside designed to expandsteelmaking at Lackenby. The Government have made it clear that they accept the case for substantial new investment in UK plate mill capacity inthe period at a suitable location. Final decisions on this have however notyet been reached. Further developments at Scunthorpe, where the Anchorproject was completed in 1973 and a new rod mill commissioned in 1976,include investment in billet capacity and the first stage of a new coke ovencomplex. The Thrybergh bar mill was formally opened in 1976. A second phase of coke oven investment will be going ahead at Port Talbot, wherethe full extent of further development remains under consideration. other schemes in progress provide for the expansion of tinplate production atEbbw Vale, and substantial investment in the Sheffield area, particularly to expand production of stainless steel flat products. In addition to the  200million Ravenscraig development currently under construction, there is aconsiderable provision for further investment in Scotland. At Hunterston,work is proceeding on the new ore terminal and on a direct reduction plant to produce iron pellets. Other schemes in Scotland include the developmentof facilities for well casing for use in offshore oil installations, and the planned expansion of electric arc capacity.26. Total expenditure on fixed assets in the 4 year period 1976-77 to1979-80 is expected to be some 2\ per cent higher than was forecast in cmnd 6393. The decrease in the earlier years, resulting largely from re-phasing provisions for some major projects, is more than offset by higherforecast expenditure in 1978-79 and 1979-80, although the expenditurelevel forecast for 1980-81 shows a small decline compared with these twopeak years. The pattern as well as amounts of expenditure could be affectedby decisions on major projects.27. In addition to the main development expenditure described above,BSC undertakes limited investments in other activities in the UK and overseas, chiefly designed to secure raw material supplies, provide salesoutlets, and assist in job creation activities in areas affected by steel closures.28. BSC has to finance increases in its working stocks in 1976-77 asbusiness picks up from the very depressed level of 1975-76, and is under-
taking further counter-cyclical stocking against the next period of highsteel demand. Its working capital requirements also reflect the need to finance stock inflation and an increasing level of trade debtors over thetwo year period 1976-78. BSC is forecast to remain within their 1976-77cash limit on external finance of  950 million.29. bsc&apos;s internal generation of funds is improving, but is neverthelesslikely to remain low during much of the period 1976-78 while the steelmarket recovers more slowly than previously expected. As a consequence,the Corporation inevitably has a heavy requirement for external finance for their development programme and other capital expenditures. Thefunding of the development programme includes allowance for substantialoverseas borrowing from e.c. Institutions, principally the ECSC.Post Office30. A Committee chaired by Mr C F Carter is carrying out a comprehensive-sive review of the Post Office. The Committee is expected to report in the spring.31. The Post Office&apos;s cash limit for 1976-77 is set at  335 million. the financing table shows that the Post Office expects to require  216 million. Anumber of factors have contributed to this reduction in the requirement. Tele-communications traffic, which had to be forecast against the background oftwo large tariff increases in 1975, in fact held up a little better than ex-pected. And rigorous economies both on capital and current account have achieved substantial extra savings. Lower interest charges, which themselvesresult from reduced borrowing, have also helped. These improvements havepartly been offset by a rather lower trend in postal traffic than had been fore-cast. Following the Chancellor of the Exchequers statement on 15 December1976 the Post Office are budgeting for further reductions in their externalfinancing requirement of  40 million in 1977-78 and  20 million in 1978-79and the tables take credit for these changes.Telecommunicationsinvestment32. The forecasts in Cmnd 6393 made provision for an investment pro-gramme at a level of about  970 million a year from 1976-77 onwards. Thepresent programme is at an average level of about  900 million from 1976-77to 1980-81. Reductions in the earlier part of the period arise from action taken to adjust expenditure to lower rates of business growth. After 1977-78the figures reflect a continuing drive for capital economy in the Post Office.In particular they allow for the reduced level of Post Office orders for tele-phone exchange equipment announced on 8 November 1976. Computer-basedstudies carried out by the Post Office have enabled the business to match theprovision of exchange equipment much more closely with traffic levels. taken together with arrangements for the increased reuse of Strowger equipmentdisplaced by the modernisation programme, this means that the Post office is able to meet future growth with a much reduced requirement for newexchange equipment. Most of the reduction falls on orders for the older type
of electro-mechanical exchange equipment. The programme of modernisationwith the semi-electronic TXE4 type of exchange will continue, but at a slightlyslower rate.33. The telephone system is expected to grow at the rate it did in theearly 1970&apos;s until the end of the decade. Thereafter the prospect is forslower growth; but there will be a growing requirement to replace oldequipment and to make reasonable provision for new services whichadvances in telecommunications technology will make possible.

Following the return to economic pricing and benefiting from internaleconomies and the Governments counter-inflation measures the business madea profit of  154.7 million in the financial year ended 31 March 1976. Thefigure is expected to be substantially higher in 1976-77. The Governmenthas, with the agreement of the Post Office, set a financial objective forTelecommunications for each of the three years 1976-77 to 1978-79 of a real rate of return of 6 per cent on capital employed. (Real return is defined as profit before interest, but after historic and supplementary depreciation,as a percentage of average net assets revalued to replacement cost.) The PostOffice&apos;s financing forecasts are consistent with the achievement of the ob-jective from 1976-77 to 1978-79 inclusive and imply no increase in telecommunications-munications charges before 31 March 1978. From 1977-78 the Business isexpected to finance almost all its capital requirements from internally genera-ted funds.Posts35. The investment programme is lower than in Cmnd 6393. This reflectsa reduction and rephasing in the postal mechanisation programme. About67 per cent of the expenditure planned is for buildings, 17 per cent for mecha-nisation and the rest mainly on vehicles. By 1980-81 mail traffic is expectedto have recovered as follows :
36. The Post Office will aim at break-even or better for the postalbusiness and this is reflected in the Corporation^ financing forecasts.Airways and airportsBritish Airways Board37. The capital investment programme of British Airways consists mainly of aircraft purchases. A recession in the short haul market has led to areduction in the Board&apos;s requirement for short range Lockheed Tristars to two aircraft only, both for delivery in 1976-77. In contrast the long haulmarket is buoyant. British Airways&apos; eighteenth Boeing 747 is being delivered in 1976-77 and four more 747s, due for delivery in 1977-78, will introduce the longer-range Rolls Royce powered version. Two more 747s of this typeare also on order for delivery in 1978-79. In addition an order for six longrange Tristars has been agreed in substitution for the same number of the short range version and deliveries of these aircraft will begin in 1979-80.Two further Concordes are being delivered in 1976-77. The Board&apos;s fifthConcorde is now due to be delivered early in 1977-78: in the light of this change in phasing of the investment programme, the cash limit for 1976-77,set at  113 million in the Financial Statement and Budget Report, was reduced to  97 million.38. The principal feature of the financing tables is the Board&apos;s require-ment for external finance in 1976-77 of  25 million, compared with the revised cash limit of  97 million. The recovery in air traffic following thefour-fold increase in oil prices in 1973-74 has proved to be more rapidthan anticipated and has resulted in a higher level of turnover and operating profits, with a consequent reduction in the need for externalfinance. The passenger figures for the last 5 complete financial years aregiven below. They show that the number of passengers carried bv british airways in 1975-76 was up 3 per cent on 1974-75 (though still below thelevel achieved in 1973-74):1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76Million passengers............        12-2 13-3 14-4        13-3        13-8Percentage increase/(decrease) on previous year      ...............         5-8 8-4 8-2        (7 1)        3-3The requirement for net borrowing, issues of PDC and leasing for 1977-78is forecast at  64 million.39. A new financial target for the Board was announced on 19 October1976: they are required to achieve an average rate of return on mean netassets of 11 per cent over the four financial years 1975-76 to 1978-79.

The British Airports Authority (BAA) investment programmerequires expenditure totalling  172 million in the five years 1976-77 to1980-81. The programme is planned to provide adequate capacity at theAuthority&apos;s three London and four Scottish airports to cater for trafficlevels forecast for the early or mid-1980s; it does not anticipate any ofthe possible developments referred to in the Government^ consultationdocuments on a national airport strategy.41. The table below sets out the traffic assumptions (in terms of passenger throughput) on which the investment programme is based.Terminal passengers (millions)Actual      .........Estimated.........1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-7625 28 30 29 311976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80 1980-8131 31 34 36 3942. The financing forecasts show a reduction in the Authority&apos;s requirements for external finance in 1976-77 to  5 million from their cashlimit figure of  12 million included in the Financial Statement and BudgetReport. The main reason for the improvement is the increase in revenueattributable to traffic proving somewhat higher than the forecasts under-lying the investment programme.43. For 1977-78 no need for borrowing is foreseen but there will bean external financing requirement of  4 million, consisting of an airportdevelopment grant for Aberdeen.44. Discussions on a new financial target for the Authority are now taking place. The previous target was for an average rate of return onnet assets of 15.5 per cent over the three years 1973-74 to 1975-76: 4IieBAA actually achieved an average rate of return of 14.2 per cent.Surface transport industries british Railways Board45. Some 90 per cent of the Board&apos;s investment is in its railway business:the remainder is devoted to the ancillary businesses such as shipping, hover-craft and hotels. Most of the expenditure maintains existing services, includingparticularly renewal of track and signalling in up-to-date forms.46. The Board&apos;s programme includes investment in high speed trains,which are being introduced in inter-city passenger routes. Investment insuburban services includes the major scheme to electrify and provide new
rolling stock for the Bedford St Pancras Moorgate line. Among theschemes for investment in the freight business is rolling stock needed to carryessential materials for electricity generating and for the iron and steel industries. The ceiling on the Board&apos;s investment (other than that financed by Passenger Transport Executives (PTEs) and local authorities) is the samein real terms as that underlying Cmnd 6393, after adjusting for changes inaccounting procedure. However, the presentation in the table is simplifiedin that only the Board&apos;s own investment ceiling is shown. The correspondingtable in Cmnd 6393 included investment financed by PTEs and localauthorities under BRB and an offsetting deduction was made from the total for nationalised industry capital expenditure. As in Cmnd 6393 this invest-ment scores as public expenditure and is included, but not shown separately,in local authority public transport investment in table 2.6. The relevantfigures are as follows:  million at 1976 Survey prices1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80 1980-8134-5 48-2 52-6 49-7 59-3 59-3These figures include investment by the Tyne and Wear Metropolitan CountyCouncil in the Tyne and Wear Metro, and the local authority contributionto Clyderail.47. The Board&apos;s infrastructure investment, in track and signalling, countstowards the investment ceiling and is therefore included. But, under financial provisions adopted following the Railways Act 1974, it is charged to revenue.The passenger element attracts grant support which, as in Cmnd 6393,is included as public expenditure within the provision for Central Govern-ment subsidies in table 2.6. Hitherto to avoid a double-count within public expenditure, this provision was also deducted from the total for nationalised industry investment. This deduction is no longer necessary. For purposes of comparison it has been similarly added back to the Cmnd 6393 total of nationalised industry capital expenditure.48. The financing tables show that the Board expect to keep within theircash limit on external finance in 1976-77. For both 1976-77 and 1977-78,the figure for Government grants corresponds to the provision in table 2.6for passenger subsidy (including level-crossings grant), freight grant and thepensions grants.British Transport Docks Board49. The Board has 19 ports which by value handle about a quarter of britain&apos;s sea-borne trade. Investment by the Board will include replacement of harbour works and me-hanical handling equipment in addition to unit loadberths and bulk handling facilities. The Board expect to be self-financingthroughout the period and have begun to repay their commencing capitaldebt. The Board&apos;s financial target is under review.
British Waterways Board50. The Board is responsible for the upkeep of some 2,000 miles of water-ways throughout Britain of which 300 are maintained for freight-carryingcraft and 1,100 for pleasure craft. It also operates docks, warehouses, inlandfreight terminals and its own freight carrying fleet. Capital investment bythe Board consists mainly of improvement to dock facilities and depots, and expansion of warehousing activities. Grant-in-aid to enable the Board toundertake their activities is scored as public expenditure in table 2.8.The long-term future of the Board is being considered as part of the overallreview of the water industry. The Board expects to be within its cash limits for 1976-77.National Freight Corporation51. The National Freight Corporation operates through its subsidiaries,which include the two rail-linked companies, freight liners Ltd. and national Carriers Ltd. The major part of the Corporation^ capital invest-ment is in the replacement of lorries, trailers and containers and in theprovision of terminal and depot facilities. At the end of 1975, operatingsubsidiaries in the United Kingdom had over 22,000 powered units, and inaddition freight liners Ltd. had over 7,000 containers and demountablebodies.52. The recession resulted in a fall in carryings during 1975. Thisparticularly affected the general distribution and parcels activities, whichrecorded falls of up to 25 per cent, while volumes were maintained or increased in some specialised markets. As announced on 21 January 1976a review of strategy is now in hand. The Corporation expects to reportmore successful trading results for 1976 and to keep within its cash limit for 1976-77. The figures for investment in fixed assets for 1977-78onwards are provisional pending a satisfactory outcome of the review of future strategy.National Bus Company53. The Company has some 50 subsidiaries in England and Wales which provided for 2,000 million passenger journeys in 1975. Most operations arelocal stage services but there is also a national network of long distancecoach services. In common with other operators, the Company have experienced a continuing decline in demand for local services.54. Some two-thirds of the Company&apos;s investment is to replace vehicles.Most purchases are eligible for new bus grant, which scores as public expenditure in table 2.6. The Company also invests in the renewal and improvement of depots, maintenance facilities and bus stations. NBCreceives financial support from local authorities towards the maintenanceof its local services which also scores as public expenditure in table 2.6.A loss was recorded in 1974 and 1975, but the Company expects to showa surplus in 1976 (and to keep within its cash limit for 1976-77) and tomaintain this performance in subsequent years.
Scottish Transport Group55. Capital expenditure by the Scottish Transport Group is expected tofollow the pattern of recent years, with the replacement of buses being the major item. Most of the remainder is for the replacement of ships by newroll-on/roll-off vessels, for associated terminals, and for bus depot modern-isation. The Group expects to be within its cash limit for 1976-77. Govern-ment grants received by the Group are for support to the shipping servicesoperated by Caledonian and David MacBrayne, and for new bus grant.Provision for these grants is made in table 2.6.--v-

These figures are contained within the totalsshown in tables 2.3 to 2.11 and 2.13. The objectives and main determinantsof the expenditure are explained in the commentaries on those tables. Thefigures at 1976 survey prices do not include provision for the relative price effect.2. The changes in the above figures as compared with Cmnd 6393reflect the general reductions in spending announced by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer on 22 July and 15 December 1976, and also the need tomake adjustments within the Scottish totals to ensure, when allocating the limited resources available, that full account is taken of the needs and circumstances prevailing in Scotland.3. The most significant reductions have been in capital expenditure;this to some extent reflects a lower level of activity than had been expected,especially in new house building, but planned reductions will have to bemade in virtually all programmes, especially roads and transport andother environmental services. Much of the capital provision over thenext 2 years will be needed for projects already under way but in addition is expected that the needs of Scottish local authorities and others for public investment and new house building and house improvement will still be met and that there will be sufficient for essential school buildings and infrastructure expenditure and for a reasonable degree of progress in hospital building.

At the same time the high priority given by the Government tothe relief of urban deprivation and the regeneration of Scottish industryis shown by the fact that additional resources have been found for the urban programme and the Scottish Development Agency; and the difficultiesfaced by local authorities in bringing their current expenditure within thelimits set in Cmnd 6393 is reflected in the net increase which has been allowed over these levels in 1977-78 and later years (see also the textaccompanying table 4.2).5. The effect of the figures shown above on the programmes for whichthe Secretary of State is responsible is that significant improvements in service standards will not be possible and that, for some sources, a slightdecline in standards may be unavoidable. There will be limited scope for new developments connected with the needs of urban deprivation andindustrial growth.---

Local authority current expenditure is not subject to direct control by centralgovernment. Cash limits are placed, however, on the amount of financial assistanceprovided to local authorities by the central government through the rate support grant.(2) The difference between current expenditure, as defined for public expendituresurveys, and current expenditure ranking for rate support grant in Scotland, is that expenditure on rent rebates, rent allowances, slum clearance and contributions to housing revenue accounts are included in the former but not the latter.(3) Projections of loan charges and total relevant! expenditure for 1978-79 arenot given. The main determinant of the real burden of loan charges in 1978-79 willbe the interaction between future interest rates and the rate of inflation.(4) Relevant expenditure is the total of expenditure with which the annual rate sup-port grant settlement is concerned. It includes loan charges and capital met from revenue.1. Table 4.2 covers all current and capital expenditure of scottish local authorities including expenditure within the fields of responsibilityof departments other than the Scottish Office, together with a reconciliationbetween total current expenditure as defined for public expenditure surveysand total relevant expenditure on which the aggregate Exchequer grants tolocal authorities are calculated following the annual rate support grant(RSG) negotiations.2. In 1975-76, local authorities&apos; current expenditure exceeded the amountforecast in Cmnd 5879 (and assumed for the purposes of the rate support grant settlement for that year) but the outturn of capital expenditure was less than forecast. It seems clear that in 1976-77 current expenditure will again exceed the amounts on which the RSG settlement was based and theestimates have been adjusted to make some provision for this.

Some are controlled by reference to the amounts spent; someby reference to the amount of money which may be borrowed to be spent duringthe year; some by reference to the value of work which may be started during theyear.the RSG negotiations were conducted on the basis that public expendituremust not in the aggregate exceed the provision made in Cmnd 6393 and,having regard to the difficulties of reducing expenditure to the levels assumedthere, transfers were made from the provision for capital expenditure soas to increase significantly the provision for current expenditure. For 1977-78,the aggregate Exchequer grant has been set at 681 per cent of acceptedrelevant expenditure, and a cash limit of  69 million has been placed onthe amount of additional rate support grant that will be paid in respect of pay and price increases affecting the settlement.3. A new system of financial planning by local authorities in scotland is currently being introduced and applies initially to capital expenditureon a wide range of services. Its aim is to facilitate Government controlof the aggregate sums allocated to programmes while leaving greater dis-cretion to individual authorities in the selection and control of projects.

Mostof the reductions fall on capital expenditure which will mean the defermentof some projects.

Cash limits are placed, however, on the amount of financial assistanceprovided to local authorities by the central government through rate support grant and supplementary grants.(2) The main differences between current expenditure, as defined for public expendituresurveys, and current expenditure ranking for rate support grant, are that expenditure onmandatory student grants and expenditure met by central government grants for rent rebatesand allowances are included in the former but not the latter.(3) Projections of loan charges and total relevant expenditure for 1978-79 are not given. Themain determinant of the real burden of loan charges in 1978-79 will be the interactionbetween future interest rates and the rate of inflation.(4) Relevant expenditure is the total of expenditure with which the annual rate support grantsettlement is concerned. It includes loan charges and capital met from revenue.IN ENGLAND AND WALES1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-793 23 619 439 913 982 4,638 625 56	5 25 765 546 1,050 1,046 4,895 721 78	4 27 816 523 1,079 1,115 5,051 789 77	5 30 798 565 1,106 1,170 5,221 824 76	4 34 747 616 1,081 1,175 5,254 830 76	4 31 712 643 1,043 1,173 5,230 847 768,297	9,130	9,480	9,795	9,816	9,7577,873 232 964	8,661 276 1,017	9,010 427 950	9,242 396 1,075	9,117 363 1,144	8,994 318 t9,068	9,954	10,386	10,713	10,624(5)	t10 459 2,017 109 54 565 125	6 400 2,721 61 57 427 102	5 370 2,320 32 66 397 92	1 8 367 1,849 54 64 279 49	1 3 271 1,433 67 48 192 34	1 3 236 1,409 95 38 151 353,339	3,774	3,282	2,670	2,048	1,967-5 1 189 11 374 15 172 11	1 152 11 394 13 137 9	1 1 121 11 418 16 117 11	5 115 11 304 15 98 10	1 1 98 11 151 9 91 7	-1 1 100 11 121 8 75 7767	718	695	557	369	3224,106	4,492	3,976	3,227	2,416	2,289(5) This is compatible with the level of relevant expenditure accepted in the 1977-78 rate support grant settlement for England and Wales of  11,717 million at November 1976 prices.(6) Capital expenditure on key sector services is subject to specific departmental approval.Local authorities are however free to set their own priorities within the locally determinedsector as a whole and for this reason the pattern of spending described in this part of the tablecan be no more than a guide.(7) Most local authority capital expenditure is cash limited, though the form ofthe limit depends on the practical arrangements and the statutory powers whichare available. Some are controlled by reference to the amounts spent; some by reference to the amount of money which may be borrowed to be spent duringthe year; some by reference to the value of work which may be started during theyear.
1. Table 4.5 gives details of current and capital expenditure by localauthorities in England and Wales on the programmes described in Part2 of this White Paper, together with a reconciliation between total current expenditure as defined for public expenditure surveys and total relevant expenditure on which the aggregate Exchequer grants to local authoritiesare calculated following the annual rate support grant negotiations.2. The rate support grant settlement for 1977-78 was based on the plans for aggregate local authority expenditure in Cmnd 6393, although following discussions in the Consultative Council on Local government finance it incorporated a switch in provision of  112 million from capital to current expenditure within the total limit. Even so, in terms of the definition of current expenditure normally used in discussions with the local authorities(current expenditure ranking for rate support grant, excluding rate fundcontributions to housing revenue accounts), the settlement involves a reduc-tion in spending of about 1^ per cent in constant price terms comparedwith the latest estimates of expenditure in the current year (embodied in thefigures in the table) which, on the same definition, are about 2 per cent higher than the plans in Cmnd 6393. For 1977-78 the aggregate exchequer grant has been set at 61 per cent of accepted relevant expenditure, and a cash limit of  500 million has been placed on the amount of additionalrate support and supplementary grants that will be paid in respect of pay and price increases affecting the settlement.3. The implications of the plans for local authority expenditure in1978-79 will be discussed with the local authorities in the consultative council on Local Government Finance in the context of the 1977 public expenditure survey and the rate support grant negotiations for 1978-79.

Part 6Glossary of Terms Used and Technical NotesSection PageI Glossary of terms used 150II Price basis    ........................ 151III Classification changes       .................. 152Note: The booklet &quot;Public Expenditure White Papers: Handbook onMethodology&quot; (HMSO) gives an account of the methods used to compilethe figures for the White Paper and explains in rather more detail thanin Sections I and II below the significance of the various terms which are used.I     Glossary of terms usedChanges from Cmnd 6393: comparisons between figures in this white paper and the last White Paper (Cmnd 6393) are made in terms of 1976survey prices.Debt interest: the main debt interest figures in this White Paper coverthose debt interest payments which constitute a charge on taxation. previous white Papers have included the total amount payable to private and over-seas sectors by central government, local authorities and public corpora-tions, and estimates on this basis are shown for comparison in this white paper.Demand on output: the extent to which a particular category ofexpenditure imposes demand on currently produced goods and services.Transfer payments when spent by the recipient produce an indirect demandeffect, which is smaller than that of direct expenditure on goods and services.Gross domestic product: the total value of the output of goods and services produced within the country.Prices (constant, relative, survey)-see Section II below.Public corporations: nationalised industries, new town corporations andother enterprises publicly owned and managed in the public interest, as described in Chapter VIII of &quot;National Accounts Statistics: Sources and methods&quot;. (Direct government trading activities are not included.)Public expenditure: comprises the current and capital expenditure of central government and local authorities, excluding expenditure charged to the operating account of trading bodies; central government finance inthe form of grants, loans or public dividend capital provided towards thecost of capital investment by the nationalised industries; the capital expendi-ture of other public corporations; the contingency reserve; and debt interest at defined above. The estimates of public expenditure in this White Paperare net of charges and do not include imputed rent. They exclude the costof stock appreciation.
Revaluation: an expenditure figure is a sum of amounts each of whichis a product of eg a number of items purchased and their price. Revaluationis the process of adjusting expenditure figures based on one set of prices to figures which have the same volume content (eg purchase the same number of items) but a different price basis.Supply expenditure: expenditure by central government which is financed by monies voted by Parliament. Details are given in the Supply estimates and Appropriation Accounts. In this White Paper it also includes expenditureon the Votes of Northern Ireland departments.Transfer payments: payments for which no goods or services are received in return. They include social security benefits, grants to individuals and companies, and debt interest.II    Price basis1. Unless otherwise stated, the figures of public expenditure in this white Paper are expressed at constant prices. There are, however, twosets of constant price figures. These serve different purposes, and each sethas its own significance and importance.In volume terms at 1976 survey prices (table 5.6)2. For past years, the figures in the White Paper described as being at survey prices are the amounts of expenditure that would have been recorded if the prices prevailing at the base dates of the 1976 survey hadprevailed then; and, for future years, the figures are produced on theassumption that the survey prices will continue to prevail. Such figuresmeasure the amounts of goods and services purchased by the public sector,and thus provide an indication of the volumes of services supplied (hencethey are also referred to as figures in volume terms). They are used to plan programmes in terms of the underlying activities (eg numbers ofstaff employed; goods and services purchased) needed to give effect toGovernment policies. These therefore are the figures displayed throughoutthe individual programme tables in Part 2 and discussed in the accompanyingcommentaries.In cost terms including the relative price effect (table 5.1)3. In considering public expenditure decisions it is necessary to take account not only of the volume of goods and services of various typesit is desired to provide, but also their prospective cost. It is not practicable to forecast actual prices. The prices of some classes of goods and services have had a fairly well defined tendency to rise faster than, and the pricesof others to lag behind, the average price of GDP (taken to be a proxyfor prices in general) and it was therefore possible to establish trends in their relative prices. By projecting these trends estimates can be made, in broadterms, of the effect that the changes in the relative prices of various goods and services will have on the relative scale of expenditure in coming years;this is what is called the relative price effect.
4. Until Cmnd 5879, it was not thought necessary to take account offluctuations in relative prices about their trends. In the last few years, how-ever, there have been some marked changes in price relationships; in par-ticular, there was a very sharp increase in building costs which has nowbegun to reverse. The projections therefore now take account of deviationsof relative prices about their long-term trend levels. But there is in manycases a high degree of uncertainty in measuring the trends of relative prices,and in estimating the rate at which deviations from trend will be reversed.This means that none of these estimates should be regarded as a forecast for specific years. A working assumption has been made that the annual increasein earnings in the public sector will be about the same as average GDPprices between the years 1977-78 and 1978-79, representing a step towardsresumption of the long-term tendency for earnings to rise faster thanaverage GDP prices.5. Volume projections adjusted by the relative price effect are saidto be in cost terms, including the relative price effect. These figures enable a comparison to be made of the relative costs of different programmes inthe coming years. They can also be used to estimate the relation whichthey will bear, individually and in total, to national output at the price levels appropriate to those years. The constant price basis used for figures in cost terms is 1975-76 prices ie the average level of prices paid in1975-76 rather than survey prices, which do not all refer to the same date.Table 5.1 is in cost terms throughout. Reconciliation with figures in volumeterms at 1975-76 prices, showing the relative price effect, is shown at the foot of the table.Foreign exchange rates6. Estimates of expenditure which are directly affected by foreign exchange rates reflect average rates prevailing in October 1975, the daterelevant for costing most programmes in this White Paper. Actual pay-ments will of course reflect the rates prevailing when those pay-ments are made. However, the contributions to the European Communitiesare, under the budget regulations, based on a rate of 2.4 units of account to the  .Ill  Classification changes1. The following transfers between programmes reflect changes whichhave occurred since the last public expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 6393)in organisation and reassessment of the functions of some elements ofexpenditure:services for the disabled transferred from social security totrade, industry and employment, and health and personal social services.adjustment of civil superannuation payments between common services and trade, industry and employment.a.b.
c. British Waterways Board expenditure transferred from roads andtransport to other environmental services.d. road research transferred from other environmental services toroads and transport.e. street cleansing (England and Wales) transferred from roads andtransport to other environmental services.2. The decision to exclude nationalised industries, capital investmentfrom public expenditure and the consequent changes are explained in Part 1of this White Paper. Otherwise the Cmnd 6393 totals have been adjusted to take account of a decision to exclude that part of the Royal OrdnanceFactories capital expenditure financed by pre-payments from overseascustomers and a decision that bus fuel grants no longer count as public expenditure. The following items of continuing expenditure are shownas public expenditure for the first time:a. inclusion of capital expenditure by Cable and Wireless on otherthan fixed assets.b. adjustment between  civil superannuation  and Civil aviation authority in respect of accrued pension rights.c. public water rate contributions and other transfers approvedunder section 8 of the Water (Scotland) Act, 1949.d. contributions to certain trading accounts in Scotland.e. some payments made to private bodies under section 2(7) of theLocal Government Act, 1972.Compared with Cmnd 6393, public expenditure has also increased becauseinterest on local authority balances is no longer netted off total expenditure.The net amounts attributable to all those changes which have been taken intoaccount in this White Paper are:  million at 1976 Survey prices1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-806 nil -14 6 30Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by Williams Lea and Company Limited LondonCmnd 6721-11
