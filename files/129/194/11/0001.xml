DRUG COSTS (GREAT BRITAIN)4. I am already charged with finding savings in 1977-78 ( 10 million)and 1978-79 ( 24 million) on drug promotion costs and on prescribing.There will be difficult negotiations with the drug companies and the doctors&apos; representatives.    It would not be realistic to try for larger savings in 1977-78;  we might put at risk those that we are aiming to secure.HEALTH AUTHORITY EXPENDITURE (ENGLAND)5. The Hospital and Community Health capital programme has alreadyborne the brunt of the recent cuts.    Few, if any, starts of major new schemes will be possible next year, and maintenance and small scheme shave been reduced to a very low level.    Any attempt to make furthersignificant reductions in 1977-78 could only be achieved through the inter-ruption of work in progress - which would involve penalty payments - or byPostponing important repairs and replacements, with risks to users and tothe future^ife of buildings.    I am already under public attack because wecan neither improve nor rebuild many of our oldest hospitals.D- As for Hospital and Community Health current expenditure, mycolleagues are well aware of the increasing public concern over services to patients.    All the decisions made during 1976 for expenditure reductionswere deliberately based on the principle that the level of service to patientsmust be preserved.    The growth planned for 1977-78 in Cmnd 6393 was intended to provide for the extra costs arising from the increasing number ofelderly people in the population, with a small margin for the spread of new methods of treatment.    That margin has already been eliminated by variousextra costs falling on to the service.    Any reductions would therefore mean a lowering of levels and standards of service to patients.    To look for savings here would be highly damaging to the NHS and its patients, and wouldhe politically just as difficult as raising prescription charges.7- There is also the point that I have been at pains to impress on health authorities the importance of keeping within their cash limits and I havemade it clear that no extra cash will be provided for any who overspend.This is a hard discipline when there is virtually no margin for growth andto cut back further would make it very difficult indeed for them to maintain this control.CHARGES TO USERS (GREAT BRITAIN)8* The only existing charges which would yield more revenue are those*0r dental services and prescription charges.9* The charges for dental services are being raised by a verysuhstantial amount in 1977-78 and we plan to raise them again to yield afurther  10 million a year from 1978-79 onwards.    This second tranche has
not yet been announced, and it is likely to be strongly opposed.    If we wereto make further increases, or bring forward the second increase, we wouldbe accused - not without some justification - of virtually taking dentaltreatment out of the NHS.    So there is no more room for manoeuvre here.10.        As for prescription charges, doubling them to 40p would reduce expenditure by  35 million in a full year - assuming that existing exemptionsto protect the young, the old and the poor (which cover over 60 per cent ofthe number of prescriptions dispensed) and the &quot;season ticket&quot; concessionwere continued.    Amendments to prescription charges are made by regulations on a negative resolution.11.        Raising prescription charges would do less damage to patient carethan cutting health authority expenditure but this particular decision is essentially a political one and my colleagues are well aware of thearguments.CENTRALLY FINANCED SERVICES (ENGLAND)12.        In addition to Hospital and Community Health services the health and Personal Social Services programme includes overheads such asresearch, training and central laboratory services.    Reductions of 4 million were agreed as part of the July measures.    By further slowing down the rate of expenditure, I could find some  1-  li million here.    Buttnat is the limit.D Eapartment of Health and Social SecurityL January 19773
