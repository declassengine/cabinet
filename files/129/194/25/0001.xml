Document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government cp(77) 25copy no10 March 1977cabinetPUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY 1977 -GUIDELINES FOR PREPARATION OF SURVEY report memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. At our meeting on 24 February it was noted that decisions had alreadybeen taken on the level of public expenditure in 1977-78 and 1978-79, and therewas general agreement that it was wise for the time being to plan on theassumption of an increase of 2 per cent a year in public expenditure in1980-81 and 1981-82;   1979-80 was an awkward transitional year and the assumed level of expenditure in it would need to be considered further whenCabinet looked at the papers on priorities and the draft guidelines for the survey.2. Draft guidelines which have been drawn up after interdepartmentaldiscussion are now set out in the appendix to this memorandum.    They arenot designed as a basis for taking decisions now, but as instructions for thepreparation of the Survey Report so that we can take decisions in July.The Survey has to provide us with a benchmark to which our decisions canbe related, and options for moving up or down from the benchmark which willgive us wide enough room for choice.1977-78 AND 1978-793. Although our decisions on 1977-78 and 1978-79 have been published in the first volume of the recent White Paper on the GovernmentsExpenditure Plans (Cmnd 6721), those years still have to be covered by the survey so as to take account of any development since the White Paper,including allocations to programmes from the contingency reserve andrevised costings.    But obviously for those years the White Paper figuresprovide the benchmark to which these changes are related.THE LATER YEARS4. For those two years the White Paper figures reflect the adjustmentsmade in July and December to the earlier plans which were published a year or so ago in Cmnd 6393.    But we did not carry these adjustments throughinto the subsequent years, and we therefore made it clear that the programmefigures for the later years which had emerged from the 1976 Survey, andwhich would have been in any case increasingly provisional, were particularlyso on this occasion and would have to be reappraised in the 1977 Survey.1
With some exceptions - and lending to the nationalised industries was one ofthese - the later year figures for individual programmes were given on this basis in the second volume of Cmnd 6721 and, very roughly, represented anupdating of the Cmnd 6393 programmes.1930-815. I will come later to the question of the transitional year 1979-80.If we look beyond that to 1980-81, we find that the provisional programmes which emerged from the 1976 Survey, in conjunction with an appropriatecontingency reserve, are about 6j per cent above the 1978-79 total.    But the survey figures for 1980-81 (as well as for 1979-80) include greatly increasedrequirements for Government lending to the nationalised industries;  and this in turn includes a substantial amount of Government lending needed simply toenable the industries to refinance loans previously raised from non-Governmentsources (the domestic market or overseas).    Following our decisions lastyear, all Government lending to the nationalised industries counts as public expenditure, and will affect, for example, published comparisons between public expenditure and the gross domestic product.    But the refinancingelement is rather a special category.    Since it will be Government lending,it will have to form part of the expenditure totals, but provided that the increasein total Government expenditure was not excessive in other respects, I shouldbe prepared to take the position that it would be unreasonable to allow this special factor to distort decisions on other public expenditure programmes.6. Over and above the refinancing element, the increase between1978-79 and 1980-81 for other reasons is roughly 4^ per cent, which is not too far removed from the upshot of a cumulative increase of 2 per cent a year over the two years.    It is therefore proposed in the draft guidelines that thebenchmark for 1980-81 should be the figures provided by the 1976 Survey,which involves in effect sticking to the updated Cmnd 6393 plan as our pointof departure and not carrying through the December cuts into that year at all.THE TRANSITIONAL YEAR - 1979-807. Let me come back now to the problem of the transitional year.    Inthe 1976 Survey the provisional totals for 1979-80 and 1980-81 were not very different.    Among other things, the large stepping up of Government lendingto the nationalised industries was projected to occur in 1979-80.    Thus, ifwe did not scale down the Survey figures for that year at all, we should havea jump of 6 per cent in 1979-80 over 1978-79;  even apart from the refinancingfor the nationalised industries, the jump would still be 4 per cent in a singleyear.8. I attach two tables which illustrate this problem.   Table A shows theprofile of total public expenditure presented by the figures which emerged from the 1976 Survey - as adjusted by the December cuts up to 1978-79 but without any carry-through of the cuts into the later years, except in the special cases of food subsidies and Regional Employment Premium (REP).    Table Bgives a breakdown, by main programme, of the expenditure included inTable A.2
9. It would be an unviable basis for our financial and economic planning,and it could revive all the problems of confidence which we have made suchgreat efforts to surmount, to base the 1977 Survey and the next White paper on a 6 per cent jump in 1979-80 - and if we did so it would be the moredifficult to persuade the world to disregard the refinancing element in this.It would be all the more out of the question to take this as the starting point for a subsequent 2 per cent annual growth in public expenditure.    It was forthis reason that the memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP(77) 21) proposed that the planning assumption of a 2 per cent real annualgrowth should start to operate from 1979-80.10.       The proposals on 1979-80 in the draft guidelines are therefore asfollows.    For those services which were unaffected by the December cuts,the figures which emerged from the 1976 Survey would provide the benchmark;and the new figures to be presented to us in the Survey report in July wouldsimilarly be unaffected, though it would then be for decision whether theyshould stand or not.    For those services which were affected by the december cuts, I suggest that the Treasury and Departments should try toagree figures for 1979-80 providing a reasonably smooth path between those for 1978-79 and 1980-81:  if agreement cannot be reached, then the bench-mark can simply be the mid-point between the 1978-79 and 1980-81 figures.On the basis of the figures for these services presented to us in the Surveyreport in July, we should decide whether to approve this path back to theCmnd 6393 plan, or whether we should decide in favour of an alternativepath.    The options mentioned in paragraph 12 below would provide thematerial for doing this.11.       Nevertheless it is fair that I should give the best indication that I can at this stage of the implications of applying this approach to the programmes in question.    As Table B shows, the main increases between 1978-79 and1979-80, if we did not carry through the December measures at all, would bein defence, overseas aid, roads, housing, other environmental services and health;  and there is also an increase in lending to nationalised industriesapart from the refinancing element.    The approach put forward by the guide-lines would still imply growth in these programmes compared with 1978-79,but not to the provisional levels given in the second volume of the recentWhite Paper.    It would be for decision in July whether this transition back tothe previously planned level was acceptable for these programmes and, ifnot, how any change to the Survey figures could be accommodated.OPTIONS AND ADDITIONS12.       For each year from 1978-79 onwards the draft guidelines in theAppendix provide for the tabling both of proposed additions and of options for reductions on each programme.     Their inclusion in the Survey report doesnot carry any implication that we will adopt them;  the tabling of downwardoptions is to enable us to examine choices and priorities if we wish to financeunavoidable increases elsewhere, or (in 1978-79) if we need to have an expenditure component in the &quot;fiscal adjustment&quot; mentioned in the15 December statement.    In view of the present Parliamentary situation, i suggest that options for reductions should not be included which would requirenew main legislation.3
THE FINAL YEAR13.       We also need to consider the guidelines for 1981-82.    We have already agreed for this year that planning should be based on the assumption of a2 per cent increase overall.    This does not however mean that all programmeswill increase at that rate.    We shall need to decide where the benefit shouldaccrue.    The draft guidelines therefore suggest that for 1981-82 we shouldgenerally take the level of the previous year as the benchmark, and then consider what additional amounts to add to individual programmes, either because of increasing costs of existing demand-related or demography-related services, or to accommodate new proposals.PUBLIC CORPORATIONS14.       Officials are at present engaged on a study of the extent to which public corporations other than the nationalised industries can be treated in public expenditure in the same way as we have already decided for the nationalised industries.    I will report the outcome of this review to cabinet before we come to take decisions on the Survey.    In the meantime, theguidelines provide for figures to be made available on both bases so that wecan make any changes smoothly when the time comes.CONCLUSIONS15.       The nationalised industries will be the subject of a special exercisewithin the framework of the Survey as a whole.    I hope that this will help to deal with the refinancing problem as well as enabling new finance for the nationalised industries from the Government to be provided within the growth rate envisaged for- Government expenditure as a whole.16.       My proposals are that, apart from refinance for the nationalised industries, the guidelines for the 1977 Survey should enable us in July to take,as the starting point for our decisions, Survey figures compatible with a2 per cent real annual growth in public expenditure, including a growth of around 4 per cent spread over the two years up to 1980-81.    The approachindicated in my paragraph 10 would enable us to consider alternative pathsfor the transitional year 1979-80.17.       The last thing that we want is to repeat the old mistake of over-commitment and of allocating extra resources before we are sure of them.The proposed guidelines are designed to present us with figures, as a pointof departure, which run the least risk of having to be cut either in July,when we have to take our decisions, or later on after we have published thenext White Paper.J treasury Chambers10 March 19774

introduction the purpose of the 1977 Survey is to enable Ministers to decide the level of public expenditure programmes as a basis for control in 1978-79; and to review the programmes for later years, and extend them into 1981-82, for provisional planning purposes.The starting point2.     The 1977 Survey takes as its starting point the levels ofexpenditure programmes which emerged from the 1976 Survey, as amended by the decisions announced on 15 December 1976 and any subsequentcollective decisions on the use of the contingency reserve.    special treatment will however need to be accorded to the transitional year1979-80.3.     For the years 1977-78, 1978-79 and 1980-81, the figures to beincluded in the Survey tables are those which emerged from the 1976Survey and the December decisions, adjusted for:-i. revaluation to 1977 Survey prices.ii. any changes approved by Ministers as a charge on theCmnd 6721 contingency reserve up to 31 May 1977, and anyoffsetting savings agreed in connection with such changes;iii. for 1977-78, any reduction in the volume of expenditureagreed during the examination of Estimates;iv. any reductions after 1978-79 which flow from policy changes announced in the December statement, or other directconsequences of the measures taken to effect the December cuts;v. any approved classification changes.^*     For 1979-80, the figures to be included in the Survey reporttables, for those services not reduced by the December cuts, shouldbe calculated as in paragraph 3 above.    For those services which were^educed by the December cuts, the Treasury and Departments should seek1PROPOSED BASIS FOR PREPARATION OF 1977 SURVEY REPORT
to agree figures providing a suitable path between 1978-79 and1980-81.    Failing such agreement, a figure midway between those for 1978-79 and 1980-81 should be inserted in the programme tables asa benchmark from which subsequent changes can be measured, but the options (see paragraphs10-11   below) should indicate possible alternative paths.5.     For 1981-82, the Survey figures should be equal to those for1980-81, except where it is agreed between the Treasury and theDepartment concerned that some lesser figure is appropriate.    Anyrequirements going beyond the 1980-81 level should be identified for cabinet decision.The Survey Report6.     The Survey Report should set out for each spending programme the information shown in the Annex.    The main components of this information are:-a. the Survey figures;b. any additional (or reduced) requirements for themaintenance of existing planned standards;c. any proposals for new developments;d. options for reductions.Only in exceptional circumstances should proposals for additional expenditure be included under (b) or (c) before 1979-80.7.     The report on each programme should describe the implications of keeping expenditure on the services concerned within the Surveyfigures.    Each of the items under (b), (c) and (d) should also bebriefly described.   This description should include an indication0f the spending   authority concerned (ie central Government Department,local authorities, or public corporation).   Any consequences for civilservice or local authority manpower should be clearly stated.2
8-     In the case of items under (b), the description should identify the nature of the additional (or reduced) requirements, ie whetherthey reflect revised demographic or demand estimates or changes inthe underlying economic assumptions.    It should also indicate whetherthe level of the expenditure concerned is governed by existing legislation or regulations or is within the Government&apos;s administrativecontrol.9.     If any additional requirements are included under (b) and (c),the Report should describe how, if necessary, offsetting savings could be found within the Department&apos;s programmes as a whole.10.    In the options under (d), the aim should be to illustrate themaximum feasible reductions in 1978-79 and later years, amounting toat least 2-  per cent in 1978-79 and 5% in later years, over and above those required in paragraph 9&apos;    The responsible Department andspending authority should be identified in each case.   For 1979-80,if the path has not been settled by agreement, the options should alsoillustrate possible alternative paths for Ministerial decision.11.    Options for reductions should not be included if they wouldRequire new main legislation.    The Report should indicate whethersubordinate legislation is required or not.    The inclusion ofParticular options in the Survey Report does not carry any implication that Ministers will necessarily adopt them, but is intended to enablethem to examine choices and priorities if they wish to financeunavoidable increases elsewhere, or (in 1978-79) if it is necessaryto provide an expenditure component to the &quot;fiscal adjustment&quot;Mentioned in the December statement.12.    In those instances where additional requirements or options for reductions do not exceed  1 million in any one year, they need notbe displayed separately in the Survey Report but will be for separatediscussion between the Treasury (and CSD where appropriate) and thedepartments concerned.13.    The nationalised industries will be the subject of a specialexercise.    There will be a separate interdepartmental report to ministers on the investment programmes and financing of each industry,3
including appropriate options in respect of individual industries.The financing figures for the nationalised industries as a whole will be summarised in the Survey Report, and if the proposals for total net Government lending are higher than the Survey figures inProgramme 5, the reasons for this will be summarised and optionsfor offsetting reductions will be set out.14.    The presentation of public corporations (other than the nationalised industries) is at present being reviewed, and the survey report should reflect the decisions which will be taken onthat review.    In the meantime, figures should be established both for investment by these corporations and for the Government financeprovided to them, so that any presentational changes can be madesmoothly as soon as the decisions have been taken.
