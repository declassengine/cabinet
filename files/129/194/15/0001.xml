THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp (77) 157 February 1977CABINETLEGISLATION ON DIRECT elections to THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentINTRODUCTION1&apos;     At the meeting on 21 October (CM(76) 27th Conclusions, Minute 5),it was agreed that the drafting of legislation on direct elections tothe European Assembly should begin.     Subsequently, the Lord Presidenthas given authority for the use of Parliamentary Counsel and work has&quot;been put in hand on the drafting of legislation on a tentative basis,I was invited to submit a paper in due course on the allocation of seatsbetween the component parts of the United Kingdom and the possibilityQf drawing up constituencies for direct elections using a truncatedBoundary Commission procedure.2.     The various issues on which decisions are required before legislationcan be introduced were discussed by a meeting of the Ministers primarily concerned on 21 January.     It was the view of that meeting that therewould be advantage in publishing a IJhite Paper as a basis for discussion in Parliament before legislation is introduced.     In form, the White paper would be a response to reports of the Select Committee on DirectElections to the European Assembly.     The Hhite Paper would set out theGovernment*s vievjson the Select Committee&apos;s recommendations.     its publication would be an indication of progress to our Community partnerswhile providing an opportunity for the enthusiasts for and the objectorsto direct elections to give expression to their feelings.     An Early DayMotion put down by Mr John Ellis and supported by at least 60 Membersillustrates the strength of feeling against hurried legislation.copy NO80
3.     A draft White Paper is at Annex A.     In most cases a firm Government view is expressed, hut in some cases the wording is more tentative to enable final decisions to be taken in the light of Parliamentary debate on the White Paper.MAJOR ISSUES4.     The most difficult matters, which raise important constitutional issues,are -a.     Allocation of seats;     There are major political difficulties incoming to a decision on the allocation of seats.     Amongst those is thecurrent argument about the proper level of representation at Westminsterfor Scotland and Wales once the devolution proposals in the Scotland andWales Bill have come into effect.     It is clear that no solution on theallocation of seats will be satisfactory to all.     The Select Committee,recommendation (England 66 seats, Scotland 8, Wales 4 and Northern Ireland 3)has, however, the advantage of enabling a proportional representation sy^00to be used in Northern Ireland.     The draft White Paper, therefore, propose5this allocation, but points out that it could be reviewed by a Speaker*conference on Electoral Law for subsequent rounds of direot elections.h*     Electoral system;     The Select Committee have recommended that thefirstx-past-the-post system should be used.     I think that most of us wouldbe in broad agreement with this for Great Britain, but it would pose pro0for minority representation in Northern Ireland.     The Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland has, therefore, proposed that a single transferable vote system of proportional representation should be used for the clectio11of the proposed three Members in Northern Ireland which would constitute asingle constituency.     Although this will increase the pressure for aproportional representation system for Great Britain to give representati0to significant minorities (in particular the Liberal Party), I think thatthe House can be persuaded to accept that the special circumstances ofNorthern Ireland make a separate system appropriate there, as in otherelections.
Co     Determination of constituencies:     The choice of procedure for the determination of European Assembly.constituencies is extremely difficult.If we are to adhere to the target of May/June 1978 for the first round ofelections, we need to have the constituencies settled by the end of 1977.The time is past when wo could opt for the procedure recommended by theSelect Committee (that is, the application of the Parliamentary boundary commission legislation in full but with provision for one round of representations and local inquiries only) and still expect to be able tohold elections in May/June 1978.     If there is any possibility of that dateslipping, then this could be the best option.     But on the assumption thatMay/Juno 1978 remains our target, we are faced with a difficult situation.It seems better that we should involve the Boundary Commissions in some waythan that wo should lay down the constituencies in a schedule to the Bill orby an order not involving the Boundary Commissions under the Bill.   It isclear that any abbreviations of a full Parliamentary Boundary Commission.Procedure will present political difficulties in the House of Commons, wheremany x-dll press for full procedures as a means of delaying the first round of elections.     Paragraphs 8-11 of the draft White Paper aim to bring outthe difficulties clearly and explain why the Government, with some reluctance,favours a truncated procedure for the first elections which would providefor one round of representations but no local inquiries.There arc various other matters covered in the draft White Paper which could^    ^ controversial.     One relates to the proposed rejection of the Select^-ttce^s recommendation that we should extend the franchise to certain BritishXB resident abroad.     I think that wc can successfully argue that the normalL-cn to suggestions of this kind is that changes which have such obvious^ce to the Westminster system should not be made without prior recommendationsa Speaker*s Conference.     Paragraph 12 of the draft !Mte Paper takes this^ another matter which may prove sensitive is the proposed requirement forGeminations for candidates at European Assembly Elections.     This is a reductionf.      10 Select Committee*s recommendation, but it may be argued that even this extent^       1s too high.     I think that our final decision could be made in the lightc&quot;bato.     Further consideration will have to be given to the procedure fornS with by-elections.
TACTICS6.     In order &quot;to clarify debate on the options in paragraph- 10 of the    ,White Paper, specific dates have been mentioned for the submission of theBill for Royal Assent.     This may, however, prove a hostage to fortune and encourage delaying tactics.7.     I understand that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would like to ssome reference in the Hhite Paper to the possibility of elections to theEuropean Assembly coinciding with domestic elections, contrary to therecommendation of the Select Committee, and to the need for consultation wi&quot;with the other parties to ease the passage of the Bill.     My colleagues will wishto consider these points.RECOMMENDATIONI invite my colleagues to agree -a. to the publication of a White Paper in the terns set out inthe annex;b. to arrangements being made for an early debate on the White Paper.M RHome office February 1977
DRAFT     (3rd - amended)MUTE PAPERDIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLY. Members of the European Assembly are at present nominated by nationalParliaments from among their Members.   As explained in the Green Paper on direct Elections to the European Assembly (tod. 6399) published in 1976,the Treaty of Rome provides in Article 138(3) for the introduction of direct elections to the European Assembly.   This has been seen as animportant&apos; means of strengthening democratic participation In Community affair;2.   Agreement was readied between all Member States (including the United  .Kingdom) on 20 September 197^ on the text of the Council Decision published as (fetri. 6623.   The substantive provisions of this Agreement will not come intoforco until all Member States have completed their respective constitutionalrequirements.3-   The preamble to the Decision records the agreed intention of Member State:that.the first direct elections to the European Assembly should he held in th.Period May/June 1978.   In recognition, however, of the possibility that someHemher States might have difficulty in completing the necessary legislative^other preparatory stages in that timcccale, no binding date for firstSections was set.   The Agreement provides for the Council, acting unanimous!;*fter consulting the Assembly, to determine the date of the first elections* a later stage.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government has undertaken to use its bestfavours to be ready for elections by May/June 1978 and The Queers speech.0J? November &quot;1976 contained a commitment to introduce the. necessary legislationln the current session of Parliament.*4 ^he Agreement of 20 September 1976&quot; lays down that, subject to itsprOfvisions, electoral procedures should be governed by the national provisioneach Member State. . Sehieor e   is.   a number of major issues of^incipl0 (for example, over the allocation of seats and the electoral systefi0 ^e used) which require very careful, consideration.   The Government has
.     ssisted by the Second and Third Reports of the House of CommonsSelect Committee on Direct Elections.    This White Paper sets out theGovernment&apos;s views on the Select Committees recommendations.   These dealwith fundamental constitutional issues and it is proposed that they shouldbe the subject of Parliamentary debate which will further assist the Governmentto finalise the preparation of legislation.ALLOCATION OF SEATS5.     The allocation of the United Kingdom&apos;s 81 seats to the component partsof the United Kingdom is clearly of considerable importance.   It would bePossible to base the allocation of seats directly in accordance vifch the size of the electorate in each of the component parts or in accordance with thecurrent representation at Westminster, or in other ways.   For subsequentelections, the allocation of scats and the determination of constituency boundaries (which is dealt with below) can be referred to a Speaker&apos;conference on Electoral Law.   For the first elections, bearing in mind,among other things, the special circumstances of Northern Ireland, theGovernment proposes accepting the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation on theallocation of seats.    This would give England 66 seats, Scotland 8, Wales hand Northern Ireland?.ELECTORAL SYSTEM6-     The Select Committee recommended that the first-past-the-post systemat present in use for Parliamentary elections should be used in the UnitedKingdom for the first elections to the European Assembly.   The Governmentaccepts this recommendation so far as Great Britain is concerned, but considerstfcat in the special circumstances of Northern Ireland the proposed three members for the Province should be elected by the single transferable voteAstern of proportional representation;    this system lias already been used** local government, Assembly and Convention elections in Northern Ireland.^TERMINATION OF CONSTITUENCIES?*     The Government agrees with the Select Committee&apos;s recommendations that^european Assembly constituencies should be formed by grouping existingfilamentary constituencies and that the number of electors in each of theSuropeau Assembly constituencies should be approximately equal (with someG*exceptions for geographical reasons).    In Northern Ireland where MembersV,0uld be elected by proportional representation (seo paragraph 6),CONFlQ-i HIAL   /ItotU^n Inland
Northern Ireland would comprise a single European Assembly constituency.Q*     The procedures for the determination of Westminster constituencies arelaid down in the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Acts 19^9 and^95b\    These proceduies make provision for representations to bo made to the boundary Commissions about their provisional recommendations and for local^-nquirics to be held;    if necessary, two rounds of representations and localinquiries may take place.9*     The Select Committee have recommended that the European Assembly constituencies-Uencies should be determined on the basis of recommendations from theParliatneirt;ary Boundary Commissions, using as far as possible similarProcedures to those employed by the Commissions in the reviews of Parliamentaryconstituency boundaries.    The Select Committee believed that some curtailmentQf these full procedures would be necessary for elections to be held in Hay/June 1978 and recommended that the existing procedures should be followed,DUt with provision for one round only of local representations and inquiries,-&quot;-ne Government similarly takes the view that it is very desirable for the^parliamentary Boundary Commissions to be asked to make recommendations on the&quot;^termination of the boundaries for European Assembly constituencies.   ForGUosequent elections, it would seem appropriate for the full Parliamentaryenstituency review procedures to be followed, but it would not be possiblei0r the Commissions to follow these procedures for the first elections ifthese are to be held in May/June 1978.In the Government&apos;s view a choice must be made between the following three options for the first elections:-A. Boundary Commission recommendations following one round of representations and local inquiries, orB. Boundary Commission recommendations following one round of representations but no local inquiries, orC. Boundary Commission recommendations with no representations or local inquiries;Inevidence to the Select Committee, the Boundary Commissions suggested that0ra the time of Royal Assent to the relevant legislation up to the-   confidential
submission of their reports, Option a would take a niminum of jo weeks, Option 3a minimum of 18 weeks and Option G a minimum of 9 weeks.   Bearing in mind thatsome 6 months will be needed to select candidates and prepare for theelections, the Boundary Commissions will need to complete their work bythe end of 1977 if elections are to be held in Hay/June 1973.   This means that legislation will need to be submitted for Royal Assent as follows:-Option a   -      by the end of May 1977Option B   -       by mid-August 1977Option C   -       by mid-October 197711.   The Government considers that it would be unsatisfactory for thereto be no provision for either representations or local inquiries and thereforefinds Option C unattractive.   Ou the other hand, there is insufficienttime to be at all sure of implementing Option A.   V/ith some reluctance, theGovernment therefore inclines in favour of Option 3.    for the first elections,since this would at least provide some opportunity for the political parties and other interested bodies to express a view on the Commissions11Provisional recommendations.FRANCHISE12.   The Government agrees that the franchise for European AssemblySections should in general be the same as for United Kingdom parliamentary elections with the addition of peers.    The Select Committee recommended thatthe franchise should be extended to certain United Kingdom nationals residentOverseas, but the Government  docs not consider that this important extension,which would have obvious relevance to the franchise for Westminster, shouldhe made without prior consideration by a Speaker&apos;s Conference.DISQUALIFICATION13.   The Government proposes accepting the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation ofdisqualification.    This would mean that the rules governing disqualificationof   candidates for Westminster elections would be applied with the modificationthat peers and all clergymen would be allowed to stand for election to the^Wopean Assembly.   Members of the Westminster Parliament would not be^ qualified from election, to the European Assembly.^KJFIDPNTIAi*.Jl   Nil    IhJ immi \ ft  lM\Ah.
CONDUCT OP SECTIONSM.   The Government accepts the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation that in.General normal United Kingdom Parliamentary electoral law should apply tothe conduct of European Assembly elections.   This would cover the present arrangements for absent voting by post or proxy and the arrangements for service voting.. -   - &apos; . .DEPOSITS -   ; &apos;.&apos;   ..15.   The Select Committee recommended that the deposit should be set at .150 for each Parliamentary constituency contained in the european assembly constituency.   The Government takes the view that it would bopreferable for a fixed ad ratter lower deposit to be sat and proposes      sum   of  500irrespective of the size of-the Assembly constituency concerned.   A depositof this size would deter frivolous candidatures without unreasonablyinhibiting genuine candidates. ...NOMINATIONS :&apos;   **&apos;.      &apos;&apos;&apos;. : : &apos; -&apos;   -;&quot; : &apos;16. The Select Committee recommended that nominations should he accompaniedV the signatures of ten per Westminster constituency of those eligible to ^Vote in the European Assembly constituency. The Government considers thatthe number of nominations required for European Assembly elections should be greater than that required for a Westminster election, but docs not considerthat the increase should be in proportion. The Government therefor proposes that nominations should be accompanied by the signature of a fixed number ofSectors in each European Assembly constituency and proposes that thisnimiher should be set at about 50.BURNING OFFICERS .17.   The Select Committee recommended that in England and Wales the returning officer should he appointed by the Chief Executive for the countydeluding metropolitan counties and the Greater London Council) in which the^opsan toblycoddiuen^ (or the larger part of it) is situated.   In Scotland,they recommended that the returning officer should be appointed by the- Sccreta.ry of State from among those appointed to act as returning officers at regional or Island council elections.   In Northern Ireland, they^commended that the returning officer should be the Chief Electoral0fficcr for Northern Ireland.   The Government accepts the recommendationsT1 fv I    .  .
in relation to Scotland and Northern Ireland, but considers that it wouldho more appropriate in England and Wales for the Secretary of State toappoint the returning officers, from among the returning officers for the relevant Parliamentary constituencies (the sheriff of the county or the mayor of the borough or the chairman of the district council).   They would he required to delegate moot of their duties to an acting returning officer,Election expenses limits . ,. -&quot;18. -The Government proposes, as recommended by the Select Committee, to consult the political parties on an appropriate formula for limitingcandidates&apos; election expenses.   The Government would propose that there shouldhe a free postal&quot;delivery of candidates&apos; election addresses on the same basis as for Parliamentary elections. .by-elections &apos; /-19.   The Select Committee recommended that the machinery for filling Assemblyvacancies should he set in motion by means of a writ moved in the House ofCommons.   The Government does not consider that this procedure would heentirely appropriate, since   members   of    the   Assembly    maynot    be    ir.en.bers   o  s   &quot;the.     House      of        Commons.The G o v e&quot; r n m, e n t -     accepts that arrangements will need to hewade to ensure that there is no clash between Westminster and European, Assembly by-elections and is at present considering how best to deal withthis. . .DHO/^CASTING . &quot; &apos; &apos;   .   -20*  -The Select Committee pointed out that broadcasting raises special problems -in relation&apos;to direct elections.   The Government accepts theSelect Committee!s recommendation that the full implications of this should&quot;e examined through the existing machinery for the provision of party^clitical broadcasts.
FINANCE . &quot;     , .;21.   The Government considers that the cost of administoring european assembly elections should be met out of the Consolidated Fund.   TheGovernment has not yet formed a view on whether candidates should receive any reimbursement of their expenses from central funds.   This matter is&quot;being considered in the context of the Government&apos;s consideration of therecommendations made by the Committee on Financial Aid to Political Parties(and 6601),OTHER MATTERS &apos; . &quot; &apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;   .&apos;  &apos;.&quot;22.   There arc other matters (such as the arrangements for electoral registration and for the avoidance of double voting, the counting of votesand the declaration of results) that will need to be covered.   The Governmeo-greesftha&quot;t these mailers should be conducted in accordance with normalParllamentary electoral lav; and practice.   It will, however, be necessary&quot;to make certain adaptations to fit the circumstances of European Assemblyelections.CONCLUSION.   s23.   As explained in paragraph 4 above, the Government is at presentfinalising the preparation of legislation.   In making these preparations,&quot;the Government will take into account the views that arc expressed inParliament on the&apos; ratters covered in this White Paper.Home OfficeWhitehall   SW1/  ;j; :   February 1977
