Document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government cp(77) 18 copy no    0011 February 1977cabinetREVISED INTERIM SHIPBUILDING STRATEGYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. At the request of the Prime Minister the Ministerial Committee onEconomic and Industrial Policy (El) has reviewed the interim strategy forthe shipbuilding industry adopted in May 1976 in the light of subsequentdevelopments, particularly the delay in nationalisation.2. The outlook for merchant shipbuilding is bleak.     The internationalscene is dominated by Japan who took three-quarters of the available orders in 1976.     The prices quoted by United Kingdom firms are now competitivev/ith the rest of Europe, but on average 25 per cent higher than those quoted by the Japanese yards.    Without strong Government action the numbers employed in the merchant shipbuilding industry could fall by 26, 000 by theend of 1978 (a reduction of two-thirds) with a further 15, 000 jobs lost in supporting industries.    The job losses would nearly all be in areas of very high unemployment.3- El generally endorsed the revised interim strategy to meet this situation set out in the attached paper by the Secretary of State for Industry.The main points are -a. Creation of an intervention fund operated on a selective basis tosecure orders.    Projects should be looked at individually as they come forward.     El recommend that the sum to be committed insubventions to secure orders should be limited to  65 million for theperiod fr om now until the end of March 1978.    It is envisaged thatthis should be sufficient to limit the rundown in manpower to 11, 000by the end of 1978.b. Companies seeking assistance would be expected to acceptthe need for contraction and to co-operate in measures to channelthe assistance to safeguard key yards.    The categorisation of yardsprepared for the May interim strategy would be used to guidedecisions on assistance but would not necessarily be decisive.1
c.     The specific recommendations in the Annex to the paper by theSecretary of State for Industry should be implemented (subject tofurther consideration of the implications of certain proposals not yetfully developed, including those for more flexible credit arrangements and to the agreement of guidelines for the shipping subsidiary ofBritish Shipbuilders).4. The agreement of the European Commission to the selective inter-vention fund is already being sought on a provisional basis and preliminary discussions are going well.    If Cabinet agree the next step willbe to inform the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions of theGovernments decision.     Thereafter the Secretary of State for industry would make a Parliamentary statement.    This would not mention a specificfigure for redundancies but would make it clear that despite the largedegree of support a substantial reduction in the industry&apos;s manpower was inevitable.5* The figure of  65 million to be committed by the end of March 1978to obtain orders is only one part of the expenditure on shipbuilding.    Addingin measures and commitments already approved the total public expenditure provision required to implement this strategy amounts to 83 millicn.    The costs in 1976-77 and 1977-78 fall within the existing provisions.    In 1978-79 and 1979-80 they exceed the present provision by 12 million and by  7 million.    In the circumstances I recommend thatthese amounts should be a charge on the contingency reserve.D- I recommend the Cabinet to endorse the revised interim strategy for ship building set out in the annexed paper by the Secretary of State for industry and summarised above.D W treasury ChambersU February 19772
ANNEXSHIPBUILDING policy note by the Secretary of State for Industrypj,    Action is now required urgently if we are to avert theSressive collapse of the merchant shipbuilding industry.t0    Without powerful Government action the industry will be downTjLg third of its present size by the cad of 1978.     The Clyde, theOf !!v ^e Wear, the Tees and the Mersey would carry the full forcePlus     collaPse^ with a direct loss of 26,000 jobs in shipyards,sUr^ a large share of the associated loss of 15,000 jobs inporting industries.5of q 1ienclose a Summary of a Report by an Inter-Departmental Groupiwj^icials which makes proposals to respond to this situation.    Iin       ray colleagues to agree to all the recommendations containedne Annex to that paper. Issues for Decision&apos;&apos;Un^?^e. Paper by officials identified four major issues forfoi^0^er&quot;ial decision.    My comments and recommendations are as(i)       The Scale of Assistance to Secure OrdersThe key to any credible policy of government action lies in the creation of an InterventionFund, operated on a selective basis, to secureorders.Officials have indicated the scale of interventionlikely to be needed to contain the contraction ofthe industry to various levels.    I am convinced that/a rundown
a rundown of 11,000 by the end of next year (Course IIIin the Officials&apos; Report) is as high as it is&apos; realisticto contemplate in these areas of high unemployment, wherethe prospects of attracting new jobs will be poor until we achieve a sustained period of economic growth.    Indeed,I expect very fierce resistance from the shipbuilding and engineering unions to the loss of 500 jobs a month in shipyards that even this rate.of contraction involves.Officials estimate that to held the contraction to that level will involve a commitment of  65 million insubventions to secure orders by the end of March 1978.This is an increase of  5 million on the provision weearmarked for subventions to secure orders and to cover&quot;the additional cost of advancing public sector orderswhen we considered shipbuilding policy last May.    against this there is an offsetting saving of about  10 million inthe redundancy payment schemes we then proposed.    Thetotal cost in the short term of a policy based uponlimiting the rundown to 11,000 is thus broadly comparable to that envisaged in May.However in PESO terms it would require a firm decisionnow on an additional provision of  12 million in 1978/and  7 million in 1979/80 (at 19.76 Survey Prices).      ToalLow for the provisional decision I have proposed aboveon continuing the assistance to obtain orders afterMarch 1978, it would be necessary to find a further 13 million in 1978/9,  24 million in 1979/80 and  4 million in 1980/81, but l suggest that for the presentthese sums should be regarded only as a potential claimagainst the contingency reserve.      I recognise that newresources were made available in December for industrialstrategy purposes and not all these are yet allocated.-But it would be unreasonable bo call upon these resources^9r shipbuilding purposes, as they will be required togive effect to our industrial strategy objectives. he^Length of Commitment for New Orders1 endorse the recommendation by officials that whilethe Committee snould take a provisional view on theScale of intervention to secure orders up to March 1979,should not take firm decisions for the presentbeyond March 1978.      I recommend a firm commitment of^65 million for the period to March 1978, with a provisional allocation of  60 million for the year 1978/79/(iii)2
(iii)       Hand], in ft1 the ContractionThe shipbuilding unions recognise the serious longterra problems facing the world&apos; shipbuilding industry.But so far they have strongly resisted even discussionof a policy that involve contraction.       I would propose, nevertheless, in announcing a government policy of intervention to make clear that somecontraction of the industry was inescapable andthat we should look to the unions and management for full co-operation in managing the resources we could make available to assist industry in a way that wouldsafeguard the long term future of those yards whichwould form the core.of the British industry in theyears ahead.But I think it would be a serious mistake for theGovernment to get itself into a position where itwas effectively taking the responsibility forshutting one yard rather than another.       UntilBritish Shipbuilders has been established and hasaccess to the books of all the main yards in theindustry, we do not have sufficient information to enable the Government to defend hard decisionsbetween competing yards when hundreds, if notthousands,  of jobs will turn on the decision.Civ)       SelectivityStepsSubject to the comments above, I endorse therecommendations by officials on operating a selective approach to the&apos; granting of assistance the e.c.    I invite my colleagues to agree that myDepartment should settle an application to the eec for a scheme of selective intervention inconsultation with the Treasury and the ForeignOffice.Although the e.c. is entitled to take 2 months toconsider an application, I propose that if within2 weeks we do not see signs of positive progress,we should consider an approach to the commission at high level.      My Minister of State with responsibility for shipbuilding matters will be seeking support from other member countries forquick action./(b) ..3
A Parliamentary Statement     I invite my colleagues to agree that in the light of decisions by theCabinet I should immediately seek a meeting with the shipbuilding Unions and the Organising Committee toinform them of our decisions and to seek their full co-operation in giving effect to&quot; our policies.     Thiswould be followed by a Parliamentary statement of our intentions.     This would also include a full statementof our intentions on the setting up of a trusteecompany.Ithe c,K1Ilviinvite my colleagues to agree that I should make proposals to&apos;lnet on these lines.03?

A REVISED INTERIM STRATEGY FORSHIPBUILDINGSummary of a Report by Officials and of Issues for Decisione Prime Minister invited the Secretary of State for Industry to1J1S forward proposals for a revised interim strategy for theupbuilding industry taking into full account the need for aElective approach and the concept of starting to work towards a9 concentrated shipbuilding industry around which a long-termcan he built.     In particular, he asked that:-(i)   help to rescue companies in financial difficulties should be highly selective and there should be asimilarly selective approach to the selection ofyards to be helped in securing orders;(ii)   proposals should contain a limit on the amount ofpublic expenditure which can be devoted to securingnew orders;(iii)   full consideration should bo given to special arrangements to help redundant shipbuilding workers,both by compensation and to the limited extent possible by bringing additional employment to the shipbuilding areas.^ ^his note summarises the recommendations and major issues for^&quot;^^rial decision identified in a roport prepared by an inter-^artmental group of officials under Department of Industry^ ^i^aanship in response to the Prime Ministers request.6&amp;0n has been circulated for the information of Ministers.ThatAPPENDIX
General Prospectsn   -   iiiMi mi mm Wi   mi iMinwiniaOlti it &quot; --3.      There has been no significant improvement in the long termprospects for the world shipbuilding industry since Ministers last considered the position in May 1976c    The international scene isstill dominated by Japan, which took three-quarters of the availableorders in 1976.4.      With orders obtained through Government action, british merchant shipbuilding yards secured sufficient orders in 1976 for about 40$ of their normal needs.    This was better than any otherEEC country and has meant that the beginning of the forecast rundownof the industry has been pushed back six months - from Autumn 1976to Spring 1977.5.      But without further and immediate intervention the numbers employed by the merchant shipbuilding industry could fall by 13,000by the end of 1977 and by another 13,000 in 1978, ie a rundown oftwo-thirds.    Loss of employment in the supplying industries would increase these redundancies by 60$.6,      Merchant shipbuilding, with its 40,000 workers, is the coreproblem.    The Ministry of Defence programme should provide continuity of employment at the three specialist warship builders for the next two to three years and occupy some capacity in certain other yards.This together with a reasonable volume of export orders will avoid any major redundancies in the 25,000 workers employed in warshipbuilding.The General Approach and Main recommendations.      In its main features this revised interim strategy is a development of the proposals approved by Ministers last May.    it provides as before for an intervention fund to be used selectivelyto secure orders, the introduction of a redundancy payments scheme0hce British shipbuilders has been established, and a major factoryProgramme.    But the costings are carried forward by a further year.   And to allow for the delay to nationalisation, changes inemphasis$ approach and timing have been required as well as some   new instruments for   intervention - including the creation&quot;a new trustee company to manage the Government&apos; s presentshareholdings.
high ie^*^^il2*LjEssues for decision the Report by Officials identifies four major issues forerial decision:-Ci)    The Sca&apos;J e of Assistance to Provide OrdersThe Hay interim strategy was- based on a level of intervention to secure orders .that was intended to confine&apos;redundancies in British yards to not more than 16,000 bythe end of 1978.    In view of the passage of time and because decisions taken now will have substantial financial implications beyond 1978, the analysis has now been carried forward to the end of 1979-The cost of intervention is high.    But with the serioussoeial implications of contraction for local communities in the main shipbuilding areas,  officials have examined thepossible cos I; of a slower rate of run down than that envisaged in Nay as well as alternative levels ofcontraction after 1978 that might be associated with theMay strategy.    These different levels of intervention and/the estimated ..3.      A summary of the conclusions and&apos; recommendations made in the officials&apos; Report is given in the Annex bo this note.The^e.c. . . -9-      The overriding need is to secure more orders quickly for merchant yards.    Agreement of the e.c. Commission to a relaxation shipbuilding Directive is the key to this.    Strong and continuingPressure from this country and others for such a relaxation has lea0^er the last three weeks to a useful breakthrough with Commissionofficials and willingness to discuss possible national schemes.    a formal proposal to the Commission is now being prepared.    The first priority is to bring these discussions to a quick and successfulinclusion with a view to an announcement of Government policy beforetlle end of February.10&apos;-   &apos; We cannot however be sure of success, and if within two weeks^reetnerit is not clearly in sight intervention will be required atvel with the e.c.
the estimated costs of achieving them in terms of financial commitments at-current prices for the year in question are asfollows,    (The estimates are necessarily very tentative.)Cost of Commitments incurred on Securing OrdersCourse 116,000 redundancies &quot;by december 78 rising to21,000 by December 79Course 216,000 redundancies by december 78 with no more in 1979Course 511,000 redundancies by december 78 rising to16,000 by December 79Jan 77 to march 78 m4545.651978/79 ra364-860Total in8193125A contraction of 16,000 represents about 4-0 per cent ofemployment in merchant shipyards.In considering these alternatives Ministers may wish to note that after allowing for the Govah order in early1976, the cost to March 1978 of Courses 1 and 2 above is 5 million less than the provision assumed in May forsubsidising and bringing forward orders.In comparison with the May strategy there is also anexpected saving at outturn prices of  10 million in the redundancy scheme previously approved for redundantshipyard workers.Ministers are^invjted to decide which of these three coursesto adopt in the light of paragraph 11 (ii) below and of thePECS implications in paragraph 12./(ii)    ..CONFIDENTIAL
(ii)   The Length of CommitmentThere is advantage in deferring final decisions onthe longer term until British Shipbuilders has beenestablished, and at this stage to limit firm decisions to the period up to March 1978.     Thealternative levels of commitment for this period inthe table are  45 million (16,000 redundancies) and 65 million (11,000 redundancies).(iii)   Handling the ContractionIn extended discussions with Ministers about the shipbuilding crisis, the Confederation shipbuilding and Engineering Unions have declined to discuss contraction.     But the proposed advancefactory programme costing  12 million recommended inthe Annex and other measures to mitigate the effectof redundancies cannot be announced withoutrecognition of the need for contraction in theindus try.There are two main alternatives(a) to seek CSEU acceptance of the need for aseries of major yard closures as a conditionof introducing the proposed measures ofassistance and an explicit policy of restricting assistance to those yards whichare likely to make the greatest long termcontribution to the future.(b) pending the creation of British Shipbuildersend the associated introduction of theproposed redundancy scheme, making recognitionof the need for contraction a condition of theintroduction of measures to secure orders butsecuring the rundown by a.combination of the/effect
effect of the limited level of intervention proposed and by administrative measures that are designed to concentrate the assistance on the better yards.Selectivity;It is necessary to adopt a selective approach if measures0  assistance are to be cost effective and generally in line with our policy of working towards a more concentratedshipbuilding industry.   e.c. considerations apart, a highly selective approach is difficult to operate betweencompeting companies in private ownership;    it will becomewholly practicable only after nationalisation when a public corporation will be better able to make judgments about which yards under its aegis should be helped to get new orders and which should not.   This problem is consideredlu- paras 33 - 38 of the officials&apos; report, where they recommend that in the period before nationalisation:(a)     companies seeking assistance would beexpected to accept the need for contrac-tion and to co-operate in measures tochannel the assistance to safeguard thefuture of key yards;the proposed National Shipbuilding and repairing Company should operate a selective approach towards the state-owned companies under its aegis;    anda highly selective approach should beadopted towards rescuing companies in financial difficulties.^ 0        of        wain report and Annex F    review thesehe operation of the intervention fund.v^^Staff ing Iitip] modifications\t T0st ^at ^976 Survey prices) of financial support fortt-s of commitments to obtain orders up to March 1978,CONFIDENTIAL
