document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government cp(77) 16copy no   g g7 February 1977cabinetSOCIAL SECURITY SAVINGSNote by the Secretary of State for the Home department. In paragraph 5 of his memorandum attached to CP(77) 12 theChief Secretary, Treasury referred to the possibility of making up savingslost on the Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill by:-a. postponement of the 1977 family income supplement (FIS)uprating from July to November.    This would save  5 million,as compared- with the  2 million savings which the Secretary ofState for Social Services has offered and which would involvedeferring part of the FIS uprating to November;b. postponement of the introduction of the non-contributoryinvalidity pension for married women from November this yearuntil April 1978.    This would save  8 million in 1977-78.    Thedate of November 1977 however has already been announced;  andit is now about 2 years since the relevant Act was passed;c. some adjustment of the on-going mobility allowancearrangements:  for example, to raise it in November from  5to  6. 50 instead of, as provided for in the Public expenditure survey Committee (PESC),  7 would save about  y million in1977-78 and about  2 million in 1978-79 and later years:  itwould mean a real improvement (which the Government have undertaken to achieve, if possible) of 50p instead of  1.    Somesavings could also be obtained by slowing down the take-upprogramme.2. These suggestions, together with the two savings already offered by the Secretary of State for Social Services (paragraph 4 i. and ii. in theChief Secretary&apos;s memorandum) were considered by Home and social affairs (HS) Committee at their meeting on 2 February in the context ofa more general review of the implications, including the implications forReport Stage, of defeats on the Social Security Bill.1
3. The Committee&apos;s view, which was subject to the Cabinet1 discussion of the scope for savings in the Department of Health and social security field generally, was that none of the suggestions should be pursuedsince they would all bear on relatively small groups of disadvantaged people and would arouse political hostility out of proportion to the savings obtained.The Committee agreed therefore that in advance of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion the Secretary of State for Social Services and the Chief Secretary, treasury should examine further possibilities for savings, and that this examination should be directed more towards measures which would have a lessconcentrated impact, for example, a marginal delay in the 1977 upratingof pensions and other benefits or an adjustment of the formulae for upratingor of the administrative rules under which benefits were paid.4. With the agreement of the Secretary of State for Social Services andthe Chief Secretary, Treasury I now attach, for the consideration of theCabinet, a paper prepared by officials in fulfilment of this remit.    Thisalso covers (paragraph 4) the proposal which has been agreed between theSecretary of State for Social Services and the Chief Secretary, Treasury,for implementing the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 11 November 1976(CM(76) 31st Conclusions, Minute 4) to save  25 million in 1978-79 bystarting to phase out child tax allowances for non-resident children.    Theproposal, to which some opposition was expressed at HS Committee, wouldin practice save an additional  4 million in that year.M RHome office February 19772
SOCIAL SECURITY (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL;    possible alternative SAVINGSNote by DHSS and Treasury officials at their meeting on.2 February 1977 HS Committee invited the Secretary ofState for Social Services and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to examine further possibilities for alternative savings to offset losses of savings arising from Government defeats on the Social Security (MiscellaneoiProvisions) Bill.     This note reports the outcome of that examination.Jfelsy in the November ,197,7, uprating, or ^^ ^Q^JS^-^SS^^S^m^St^!^2.     The benefits which will, on present policies, be increased- at- &quot;the november 1977 uprating are in 2 categories:   National Insurance (Nl)and other benefits which must statutorily be uprated at least annually in line with earnings or prices;    and supplementary benefit which is normally increased by the same cash amounts as the corresponding IIIrates, but where there is no statutory uprating commitment.a.     Statutoriily uprateable benefits the Government&apos;s public expenditure plans, embodied in the public expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 6721), assume the minimum uprating atthe latest date irhich is compatible with the Social Security Act1975*     No deferment or paring at all of the uprating of these benefits (which in terms of total expenditure are much the mostimportant) could be achieved without main legislation.b*     Supplement arfy bengfItA postponement of the supplementary benefit element of the upratingis in principle possible but would mean departing from the practiceof upratings simultaneous with the uprating of National insurance benefits and would mean that many supplementary benefit recipientswere, over a short period of time, disentitled and then entitledagain to small amounts of benefit.     This would cause serious administrative problems.     An. alternative possibility would be topare the scale rates by, say, lOp which would save  15 million in afull year.     But such a reduction would only affect the poor,though spread across the nearly 3 million supplementary benefitrecipients, and would contrast with the larger increases given to the better off.1
There is little practical scope for making savings on discretionary.additions to supplement cry benefit.     Many are determined by theactual size of the expenditures which they are intended to cover;    and for those which are codified in rates of additions, such as extra heatingadditions, there are already strong pressures for improvements.     any interference with its discretionary powers could lead to serious trouble with the Supplementary Benefits Commission.Benefits for hospital in-patients3.     national insurance benefits^ paid to hospital in-patients may be reducedafter 0 weeks in hospital by one-fifth where the in-patient has dependants andby two-fifths where he has none.     Normally only in the latter case, after afurther 44 weeks in hospital, the benefit may be reduced further until onlyone-fifth (the pocket money rate) is left.     If the initial 8-week periodwore shortened to 6 weeks, there would be a saving of some  2 million net in afull year, and the corresponding net figure for a shortening to 4 weekswould be some  5 million.     These figures allow for increased administrative work because of the increased number of cases in which benefits would need to ^eadjusted.     No increase in administrative work would arise from raising theone-fifth benefit reduction to one-quarter and the two-fifths figure toone-half;    in itself this would save about  2.75 million in a full year.change in either the periods or the percentages would have to be referred to independent National Insurance Advisory Committee, and if it reported adverseWas DHSS think likely - there would be great difficulty in getting thenecessary regulations through the House (they would be subject to a, negative resolution).     About 125.000 recipients of contributory national insurance benefits are affected by the present rules at any one time.Child^tax allowances for non-resident, children4* The Secretary of State for Social Services ha.s offered an additional 4 million saving in 1978-79 from withdrawing Child Tax Allowances (CTAs)from the parents of non-resident children, as a partial offset to the lossesf*The benefits in question are sickness benofit, invalidity benefit, retiremenpension and widow&apos;s benefit.     Non-contributory invalidity pension is alsoaffected by the rules, but in practice is in nearly all cases payable ^0only at the pocket-money rate. Supplementary benefit is normally reduced ^the pocket-money rate immediately on admission to hospital unless continuingoutside commitments can be shown.2

In the course of the discussions on Public expenditure towards the end of last year, the Cabinet agreed tos^e  25 million in 1970-79 and subsequent years by this means.     This,however, was a broad figure and examination shows that it would retire areduction of CTAs in 1970-79 of  105, which would, on current costing assumptions,W non-resident children with slightly larger CTAs than other children, and&quot;fcan extra processes for the Inland Revenue.     A reduction which put all children in step and needed no extra processes would, on the same basis, be one of 215 which only affects income by 20p per child per week.     This would in practiceProduce savings of  29 million rather than  25 million and in the view of theSecretary of State and the Chief Secretary cause no extra criticism.
