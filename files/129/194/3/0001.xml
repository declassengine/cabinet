DQCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 317 January 1977CABINETREFERENDUMS ON SCOTTISH AND WELSH DEVOLUTIONMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilL On 16 December the Cabinet agreed that the Scotland and Wales Billshould provide for referendums in Scotland and Wales on the implementationQf the Bill after its passage through Parliament.    We announced this later the same day, and it played an important part in the satisfactory outcome ofthe Second Reading vote on the Bill.2. We now need to settle the main features of the referendum schemes.The relevant considerations were surveyed in the Constitution Unit notecirculated under CP(76) 135.3* The Ministerial Committee on Devolution Strategy (DVY) has considered the issues, and recommends as follows:-a. There should be simultaneous but separate referendums inScotland and Wales (CP(76) 135, paragraph 9).b. The outcome should be dependent on simple majority of thosevoting (CP(76) 135, paragraph 10).c. Each referendum under the Bill should be once-for-all, notrepeatable if the answer is No (CP(76) 135, paragraph 11).d. The outcome should lead directly to the implementation of theBill, and not be merely advisory to Parliament (CP(76) 135,paragraph 13).e. As in the European Community referendum, there should not bea single central count;   subject to examination of detailed arrangements, results should be declared by regions and island areasin Scotland and by counties in Wales.    This could exposeembarrassing outcomes in Shetland or Orkney, but there is no practicable way of avoiding this possibility.180COPY NO
f. Voting should be confined basically to those on the registers inScotland or Wales (CP(76) 135, paragraphs 15-19).g. Voters should be asked only whether they wanted the provisionsof the Bill to be implemented in Scotland or Wales (CP(76) 135,paragraphs 21-27).Further detailed aspects (the precise wording of the question, Service voters,information policy, any subvention to campaigning organisations, and the like) will be considered by DVY as necessary.4. Of the basic features listed above those which raise the most difficult issues are f. and g.    There will undoubtedly be much pressure inParliament to let English (and Northern Irish) voters take part, and also to add a question about independence.    DVY believe that in each respect thearguments to the contrary are compelling, and that the Government mustfirmly resist any such pressures.5. I invite the Cabinet to endorse the referendum features summarised at a. -g. of paragraph 3.M FPrivy Council Office14 January 19772
