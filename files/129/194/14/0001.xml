MAJOR POLICY REVIEWS - STOCKTAKING AND PROPOSALS FOR REVIEWS  IN  1977,INCLUDING PARsMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the TreasuryAt the meeting of the Cabinet on l4 October 19?6  (CM(76)26thinclusions)  I was asked to circulate a stocktaking paper proposxng* Programme of PAR studies in 1977-     It was envisaged that this paper*ould be prepared annually by the Public Expenditure Survey Commxttee(PESO)  and would cover all major ongoing and planned reviews,  whether0r not labelled PAR.2-    I now enclose the first such report which has been agreed by PESC.^ is long and,  because of its detailed factual content,  there  is no obvious way of shortening it.    Part  1  sets out the reviews whichApartments have  in hand or propose by major subjects.    Some of theProposed studies are thought suitable for PAR treatment and arePrised in Part 2.    For convenience,  I attach a list of the proposalsfor future PAR studies  in 1977&apos;3-    I do not suggest that my colleagues need to read the  stocktakingr*Port but they may find it useful for reference.     It reveals the^Sree of official effort being applied to review and appraisal ofPoUcies and programmes.    The housing and transport policy reviews arein their final stages.    Fundamental questions about the educatxonalAstern are being examined.    A lot of work is being done on prioritiesf0r the health and personal social services and many aspects of socxalS6c*rity are under review.    Various studies are under way on the*Ployment front and a number of industrial sectors are being revxewedin the context of our industrial strategy.    Important aspects of6nergy are being examined.    Over programmes generally,  the currentPubHc expenditure constraints have made it necessary to re-examineCities within programmes, and this is also reflected in the revxewactivity in progress or planned.
^.    Looked at as a whole,  the reviews in hand and proposed representa reasonably comprehensive  and relevant  look at a wide range of our policies, bearing in mind the limitations on the resources whichcan be made available for this kind of work.conclusion.    I therefore  invite my colleagues -(a) to note the  stocktaking report;(b) to approve the programme of PAR studies for  1977 setout in the attached list.J.B.

  LlPROGRAMME ANALYSIS AND REVIEW) ; STOCKTAKING OF MAJOR POLICY REVIEWS; and proposals FOR REVIEWS IN 1977; INCLUDING PARsReport by the Public Expenditure Survey Committee1.     At its 26th meeting on 1* October 1976 the Cabinet approved the continuation of a modified PAR system and the Chief Secretary was invited to circulate a stock-taking paper proposing a programme of PAR studies in 1977-2.    The modified system envisages an annual stocktaking of all major on-goingalready planned reviews, so as to permit the Government to consider(a) whether the balance fits its priorities;(b) whether there are any particular areas, especially those which transcenddepartmental boundaries, which have not been critically analysed for some timeand on which studies should now be launched;(O   whether there are any of the existing, planned or proposed studies withwhich the central Departments (Treasury, Central Policy Review Staff, and -as appropriate - Civil Service Department) should be especially associated,as PARs.sports for this purpose are, under the modified arrangements, to be providedby the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC).3-    This report is now put forward by the PESC Committee for the purpose of the st^ktaking, with proposals for a 1977 programme of studies.   The substance of the*P0rt is in Part 1.   This is divided into subject headings, under each of whichth*re is an introductory commentary, noting the main issues of concern and theactivities relevant to them,so that the significance of the many reviews listedbe seen in perspective.   The commentary is followed by a three part list for*** subject, (a) policy reviews in progress, (b) future reviews already planned,(c) additional proposals for future reviews now put forward by Depart-after consultation, as worth undertaking in 1977.   Part   (c) therefore indi-C^ the areas selected for proposed new reviews;   and parts (b) and (c) together areLevant to the judgement on how the balance of future reviews fits the Government 8Cities.   PARS currently in progress and proposals for future studies to be
conducted as PARs are asterisked.4*     Part 2 of the Report summarises the proposals for future PAR studies, sopresenting a PAR programme for 1977.    Annex 1 provides a list of policy reviewscompleted since March &quot;I97-+ (presented under the same subject headings), asbackground information.    Annex 2 provides a key to symbols.5.     The Cabinet also agreed on 14 October that, apart from this stocktaking,spending or central departments are free to propose or initiate policy orProgramme reviews at any time during the course      the year.   The depth of^alysis required for any such reviews, and the extent to which the centralApartments should be involved, will be agreed inter-departmentally.   Thisreport does not therefore necessarily cover all the ground which it may provedesirable to review in 1977.   Any further reviews and studies initiated duringthe year will be incorporated in the report prepared for the next annual stock-taking in a year&apos;s time.

POLICY REVIEW STOCKTAKINGSTOCKTAKING OF POLICY REVIEWS IN PROGRESS,ALREADY PLANNED AND THOSE NOW ADDITIONALLY PROPOSED,WITH IDENTIFICATION OF PROPOSED PARsNOTESFor all PARs and proposed PARs, the lead Department is identified firstfollowed by others with an interest in participating.   Neither the Treasurynor CPRS (nor CSD) are individually identified in this way unless they arethe lead Department since they are associated with all PARs (CSD at option).por non-PAR studies, the degree of and stage for Treasury interest in most cases is not noted, since this is normally worked out ad-hoc in the courseQf normal business.   Membership of formal interdepartmental committees and groups is not given in detail in every case.identification of interested Departments is intended as information;it is not designed as definitive and changes may be made subsequently,as may be agreed.   The abbreviations used are given in Annex 2.
PART ITHE ECONOMYA AGRICULTURE FISHERIES AND FORESTRY1975 White Paper &quot;Food from our Own Resources&quot; (Cmnd 6020) was the result* a major review of objectives and justified a policy of continued expansion offood production.   The objectives and mechanisms of the e.c.&apos;s Common agricultural policy are kept under constant review;   and the statutory annual review of the^ate of the agricultural industry serves as a basis both for determining the UK&apos;sobjectives in the annual negotiation of CAP support levels and for reviewing^ose elements of support which remain under national control.   The most important of these - grants for capital investment - was reviewed as a PAR in 1973-7^-Series policy was reviewed as the first stage of a PAR which has set the back-Sround and identified the issues which are under constant review in the various^national negotiations.   The PAR can be concluded once this internationalframework is clearer.earlier cost/benefit review of Forestry policy was followed by a study oft^ economic aspects of rural depopulation and alternative ways of providingetnPloyment in rural areas.various activities are reflected in the lists below and in Annex 1.preliminary studies on land use may establish the case for a further review :] REVIEW;area.^INPROGRESS1*      On-going review of Common Agricultural Policy.

ouiMijiueaNxiAii^employment/manpowerTheovernment*s strategic concern is to improve the employment position throughPeration of its industrial^ economic and manpower policies, including the provisionacJequate training facilities and opportunities for individuals.   In the meantime,with tViWe Present high level of unemployment, the objective is to mitigate the worstOff^  ects of the recession on employment levels through selective employment andllu-iig measures.   The Manpower Services Commission (MSC) is seeking to develop a^ Nprehensive manpower policy which it sees   as having the dual function of enablingcountry&apos;s manpower resources to be developed so that they contribute fully toQomic well being, and of ensuring that there is available to each individual the^PQrtunities and services they need in order to lead a satisfactory working life. Theseectives are pursued through many channels including dealings with the TUC andthe CRTA*   Much of the work falls within the sphere of the MSC and its associatedQ ncies*   The review activity   which backs this policy area is a main part of theg01nS Wo*&quot;k of the Department and of the Commission.c lnterdePar&apos;traental Manpower Group considers manpower policy, and reviews orin    SSlons reviews of issues arising on the employment front generally.

There was an abortive PAR on this subject in 197^.   TheGPRS and the Treasury have proposed that a preliminary study on a different basis, taking into account other studies in Whitehall and elsewhere, shouldbe made in 1977*   The study will concentrate in the first place on the needfor and the obstacles to labour mobility including geographical mobility.(D.Em; DOE; D.In; DHSS; OMSC; SEPD).
TRADE AND INDUSTRYmaill priority is the industrial strategy, on which work continues in theS^tor Working Parties under NEDC auspices;    the strategy embodies the preference^nouncedby Ministers for greater selectivity in directing resources to industry.Efforts to make progress in the related area of planning agreements are continuing.A number of studies have been undertaken of specific sectors (eg the CPRS reviews0n the car industry and the power plant industry).   There have also been reviews0f aircraft and civil aviation policy.   The interim strategy for shipbuilding isb*ing reviewed;   and the future of preferential procurement from ICL is under studyin the current Government computer procurement policy review (see section XI below).not is to produce a corporate plan in late 1977;   meanwhile work   on the corporateof its main subsidiaries, including Rolls Royce, is either in hand or,in theC^ of British Leyland,was completed in 1976.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTUnder &quot;forward look&quot; arrangements in which the Government collaborateswith the Advisory Board for the Research Councils, the allocation of resourcesbetween the Research Councils is under continuing review: this is leading to along-term shift of resources from the &quot;big sciences&quot; - nuclear physics, astronomy,and space - to areas more closely related to industrial and social need, such asengineering and industrial training, and medical and agricultural research.    Withinthe field of industrial research the NEDC industrial strategy programme is leading to increasing emphasis on the effective transfer of new techniques to commercialapplication, including manufacturing technology, energy conservation, and reclamationof waste.Generally, expenditure financed on behalf of Government Departments has, following the Rothschild review some years ago, been designed to respond more closely tocustomer requirements; the effectiveness of this response is being monitored.a) REVIEWS IN PROGRESS(i) On going review of Research Councils&apos; budgets.

HOUSING AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL services the major review of housing finance and policy, which started in early 1975and has ranged over all aspects of the Government&apos;s support for housing, isnow coming to a conclusion.   Once Ministers have considered the results, and reached decisions, there will be a number of further specific studies to beundertaken arising from the review.   In addition, a PAR on the Rent Acts isUnder way;   and interdepartmental study on income related support for housingis continuing;   and there are many external Advisory Groups and Working Partiesadvising both on major policy and on technical matters.A Ministerial Committee is studying the whole range of Government problems affecting inner cities.   The water industry is under review by an interdepartmentalgroup, guided by a Ministerial Steering Group, with some emphasis on the structure of the industry and the need for a national water strategy.   A consulta-tive document was published in 1976.   Environmental pollution is under continuous review by a Royal Commission.

EDUCATION, ARTS, BROADCASTING AND PRESSMany of the Government&apos;s strategic concerns are currently under examination.Important questions about the educational system and what was expected of it were raised in a speech by the Prime Minister in October 1976.   The debate this initiatedwill be taken further in England and Wales on the basis of a consultative paper tobe issued in February covering the four main topics of curriculum, monitoring andassessment of performance, teacher training, and school and working life.   Similarquestions are already being studied by advisory bodies in Scotland which are expectedto report in 1977-The future needs of the educational system in terms of teacher supply, staffingstandards and how to overcome shortages in numbers of teachers in certain subjectseS mathematics and science, are under continuing review.   The review of arrangements^ the government of maintained schools in England and Wales should be availableearly in 1977-78, and will cover the relationships between school governors and localQuestion authorities, teachers, parents, and the community at large.   Schoollamination and assessment systems are also under review.much* of the review work is pursued as part of the on-going operations of the Depart-&quot;fcata concerned, but some of the specific studies are noted below and in Annex 1;0ne topic is proposed for joint DES and SED study, using the PAR approach.1116 Annan Committee on the future of Broadcasting is expected to report ineariy 1977.^feEWsIN PROGRESSi.
