ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1977INTRODUCTION1. This White Paper sets out the data established during the annual review of the economic condition and prospects of the United Kingdomagricultural industry. It provides information which can be drawn on whenthe Government considers how to respond to the Commission^ proposalsfor agricultural support in 1977/78 and when decisions are taken on support arrangements which lie within the UK&apos;s national competence. These decisions on agricultural support will be announced separately. The forecasts for1976/77 generally reflect the position at November 1976. The Review hasbeen conducted in metric terms but figures for the year under review aregenerally shown in imperial units as well.PART I-STATE OF THE industry. 1976/77 has been a difficult year for many farmers. Following the goodweather last winter and the decisions taken by the Government to restoreagricultural profitability in line with the objectives of Tood from Our own resources&apos; (Cmnd. 6020), it was expected that 1976/77 would see a majorimprovement in agricultural production. In the event, however, this was notachieved, mainly because of the drought. For the second year running, netproduct is forecast to fall, with the index at constant prices showing a dropof about 10%. The industry&apos;s costs have increased sharply; aggregate cost increases since the last Review are assessed at  895 million. And a substantialfall of 9% in net income in real terms is forecast. Retained earnings are a principal source of investment for the industry and this fall in net income is associated with a further reduction in the volume of new investment,particularly in buildings and works. Nonetheless, the industry is basicallyhealthy and, had it not been for the exceptional weather, the level of produc-tion could have been expected to show reasonable progress towards theexpansion aims described in Tood from Our Own Resources&apos;. The Govern-ment considers that the policy of expansion and the priorities set out inTood from Our Own Resources&apos; are still valid and should continue to guidedecisions on agricultural policy. Despite the setbacks suffered this year, theprospects for profitability overall are reasonable and, given normal weather,net product and net income should recover in 1977/78.3. In October the Government announced action to help farmers overcome the worst effects of the drought. This included an increase in the guaranteed price for milk of 0.22p per litre (lp per gallon) for the 1976/77 milk year,which enabled the Milk Marketing Boards to increase by rather over 0.44pper litre (about 2p per gallon) the price received by producers in the winter months; an increase of 3p per lb in the guaranteed price for fat sheep forthe first three months of 1977; a relaxation for the 1977 beef cow subsidypayment, of the condition that animals should be maintained throughout theyear; and an increase, for one year, of 20 percentage points in the rates of grant for the installation of water storage on farms and horticultural holdings.
4. The decline in the dairy herd has been reversed and a major improve-ment in yields in the early part of 1976 led to a substantial recovery fromprevious levels of milk production. But yields were seriously depressed bythe summer drought and total sales for 1976/77 are expected to be only \\%higher than in 1975/76. There was a decline in the beef breeding herdbetween June 1975 and June 1976 and the reduction in dairy cow slaughter-ings led to a fall of 12% in forecast beef production in 1976/77 comparedwith 1975/76. There was a small reduction in the sheep breeding flock inthe lowlands; and mutton and lamb production is expected to be slightly down on 1975/76. Wool production will be marginally lower. The pig breedingherd increased between June 1975 and June 1976 and home production of pork and bacon is expected to increase in 1976/77, but there is evidencethat the breeding herd is once again contracting. The average egg layingflock in 1976/77 is expected to be slightly lower than in 1975/76 but eggproduction is expected to increase slightly. The production of poultrymeatis expected to increase in 1976/77.5. In the arable sector, the total cereals area in 1976 was slightly higherthan in 1975 which was, itself, considerably lower than the previous year&apos;s,but, with lower wheat yields, the total cereals crop was about \ million tonneslower than in 1975. The area of potatoes planted in 1976 was in excess of the target but the yield is expected to be even lower than in 1975. Sugar beetyields from the 1976 crop are expected to show an increase over those for1975 but, with a low sugar content and difficulties in harvesting because ofthe wet weather, the increase in home production of sugar will not be as high as was originally envisaged. The area under oilseed rape rose by 23%in 1976 and estimated production increased by 72%. The area of certifiedherbage seed fell in 1976.6. Despite the effects of the drought on the volume of production in manysectors, the total value of horticultural production again increased in 1976/77because prices generally were higher. Costs also increased sharply but the depreciation of sterling gave growers a significant competitive advantageagainst imports. Growers&apos; representatives have expressed concern about thefuture and have asked for an examination of the horticultural industryextending beyond the issues dealt with in the context of the Annual Review.The Government is, therefore, now engaged in a joint examination with theUnions of the position and prospects for the industry over the next fewyears.PART II COMMODITY TRENDSCereals (Tables 2, 5, 7 and 27)7. The area of cereals harvested in 1976 rose to 3.68 million hectares(9.09 million acres), slightly above the 3.65 million hectares (9.02 million acres) in the previous year. Production is expected to total 13.45 milliontonnes, about half a million tonnes below the 13.9 million tonnes in 1975.The favourable autumn weather of 1975 led to an increase in the area plantedwith wheat which was partly offset by a decrease in barley. Yields of all
cereals were affected by the prolonged hot, dry summer weather and werelower than expected. Market prices have been substantially above 1975/76levels, reflecting sustained demand and the weakening value of the pound.8. Wet weather in the autumn has delayed plantings of winter wheat andthe total area sown by December 1976 was below that at the same timethe previous year. If the weather returns to normal during the rest of the season, however, the 1977 cereals harvest should be considerably higher thanin 1976.Potatoes (Tables 2, 5, 9 and 27)9. The 1976 target area of 221,000 hectares (546,000 acres) was exceededby some 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres). Although planting conditions were good, the development of the crop was seriously affected by drought for thesecond successive year and the average yield is expected to be only about two-thirds of that normally expected. The Government continued to suspend the ban on imports of main crop potatoes and the prohibition on exportsof ware potatoes was maintained. Prices have remained at a high levelbecause of the supply situation and there has been a marked reduction in consumption. The average market price will again be well over the guaranteed price of  39.37 per tonne ( 40 per ton). The target area for the1977 crop has been set at 210,000 hectares (520,000 acres).Sugar beet (Tables 2, 5, 10 and 27)10. In 1976 the British Sugar Corporation contracted to purchase thebeet from 206,000 hectares (509,000 acres). About 203,000 hectares (502,000acres) are likely to be harvested compared with 193,000 hectares (477,000acres) in 1975. Because of drought in the summer, average yields of beetper hectare were again below normal although they showed an increase ofabout 15% on 1975. Sugar content, however, was abnormally low because ofthe heavy autumn rainfall and sugar production, despite the increased area,is likely to be only 9% up on 1975 and 73% of that for 1973.11. The British Sugar Corporation has contracted for the produce ofabout 205,000 hectares (507,000 acres) for 1977. With a return to historicallynormal yields, this should produce around the United Kingdom&apos;s basic Com-munity white sugar quota (1,040,000 tonnes).Oilseed rape (Tables 2, 5, 8 and 27)12. Production of oilseed rape in 1976 reached a new record level. Improvedplanting conditions in the autumn of 1975 meant that the crop was well established by the summer, and was thus largely unaffected by the drought.Production was predominantly of winter varieties which led to improvedyields. Prices through the year were generally a little above intervention and,despite uncertainty about 1977 prices, production is again expected toincrease in 1977.
Beef and milk (Tables 2, 5, 14, 15, 16 and 27)13. The 1976 June census showed a 3% reduction in the total breedingherd from June 1975; the dairy herd about 65% of all breeding cows-wasunchanged but the beef breeding herd was 7% smaller. The September samplecensus for England and Wales indicated a virtually unchanged total breedingherd compared with the previous year, with the dairy herd up by 1.4% andthe beef herd down by 4.5%. The sharp reduction in 1976 cow slaughteringsshould be reflected in the next UK census.14. The fall in the breeding herd from 1974 led to a significant reductionin marketings of fat cattle this year from the peak level of 1975; total supplies of beef and veal available for consumption in 1976/77 are expectedto be about 11% below last year&apos;s level. Because of the fall in supplies,average market prices for fat cattle have been very firm throughout theyear, reaching  61 per 100 kg ( 31 per live cwt) by mid-October an increaseof  25 per 100 kg ( 13 per live cwt) over the same week in 1975. From thebeginning of the marketing year (mid-March) to the end of May, producers&apos;average weekly returns were maintained at the target price levels by thepayment of variable beef premiums and the market was underpinned by a moderate amount of intervention. Thereafter, average market prices exceeded the target prices so that no premiums were payable and intervention purchaseswere negligible.15. The average milk yield per cow in 1976/77 is expected to be lower than in 1975/76 as a result of the drought, but, because of the recovery incow numbers during the year, total sales of milk through the milk marketingschemes should be slightly higher than in 1975/76. The amount of milk soldfor liquid consumption in 1976/77 is expected to decline slightly comparedwith 1975/76 whilst the availability of milk for manufacture will increase.Cheese production is expected to show little change over 1975/76 but butterproduction in 1976/77 is forecast to increase substantially over the previous year&apos;s level. Increases in the guaranteed price for milk and the standard quantity at the 1976 Annual Review, together with the further increase inthe guaranteed price in the autumn of 1976 as part of the Government^drought measures, led to a substantial increase (18%) in the guaranteed price for milk in 1976/77.16. The size of the dairy herd is expected to increase further during 1977and, on the assumption that milk yields return to their more normal level, a significant increase in milk production should occur.Sheep and wool (Tables 2, 14, 18 and 27)17. Between June 1975 and June 1976 there was a decrease of 1% in thetotal United Kingdom breeding flock, but the decline occurred only in thelowland areas. A recovery in the breeding flock numbers is expected by june 1977; this takes account of slightly lower slaughterings in 1976/77 after a good lamb crop.
18. Home-fed mutton and lamb production is expected to be lower in1976/77 than in the previous year. Imports are also expected to be less,partly because they were high in 1975/76 as a result of shipping delays in theprevious year, and partly because a larger tonnage of New Zealand lambhas been diverted to other markets. Consequently, total supplies in 1976/77are likely to be about 5% below those in 1975/76. In the first nine monthsof 1976/77 fat sheep prices have been consistently above the level of guarantee, except for two weeks in August, and over the year may be about40% higher than in 1975/76. Prices paid for hill lambs and draft ewes atthe 1976 autumn sales were strong, being over 25% above those paid in 1975.19. Production of wool in 1976 declined marginally while prices continuedto increase steadily following the recovery in world prices in 1975. Over1976/77 as a whole, prices are expected to remain above the guarantee.Pigs (Tables 2, 14 and 27)20. The expansion of the UK breeding herd, which began in 1975,continued until June 1976, when the herd was 9% above the level of 1975.This is being reflected in increased supplies of pigmeat for pork and manu-facture. Increased costs, particularly of feedingstuffs, have, however, had amarked impact on the profitability of pig production and there is evidencethat the breeding herd is once again contracting.poultry meat (Tables 2, 14 and 27)21. Total production of poultry meat is expected to increase in 1976/77.Both prices and costs of production have risen. Chick placings continue at a relatively high level and it seems probable that production will increasefurther in 1977/78.Eggs (Tables 2, 5, 17 and 27)22. A small reduction in the average laying flock is expected in 1976/77(June/May) but total production is expected to be slightly above 1975/76levels, reflecting higher yields per bird. Costs of production have risen. Eggprices have fluctuated but it is expected that the average producer price for1976/77 (April/March) as a whole will be higher than in 1975/76.Seeds (Tables 13 and 27)23. The area of certified herbage seed fell (by about 21%) in 1976 for thesecond year in succession. Heavier demand, coupled with depressed yields,led to a substantial reduction in stocks and prices rose sharply from thelow 1975 level. Home production remains at about 55% of total require-ments.24. The area of field bean seed partially recovered from the low levelof 1975. Despite generally lower yields from the 1976 harvest, the areaentered for certification continues to be well in excess of the requirements for seed. The area used for the production of field pea seed, although smallhas increased by about 300% compared with 1975.
Horticulture (Tables 2,5, 11 and 27)25. The total area devoted to horticulture (including double cropping)in the United Kingdom fell slightly between 1975/76 and 1976/77 and isnow estimated to be 296,000 hectares (731,000 acres). Details are givenfor the four commodities of interest to UK growers covered by Commissionproposals on &quot;withdrawal&quot; prices for certain fruit and vegetables.(a) Apples. The area of apple orchards (excluding cider apples)continues to fall and in 1976/77 is estimated at 32,030 hectares(79,150 acres). Total production capacity, however, is largely un-changed because of more intensive new orchard plantings. Thedry weather led to a lighter crop than last season&apos;s and the storagepotential of some fruit may have been affected by subsequentrains. An unusually early European crop, coinciding with lateSouthern hemisphere fruit, led to lower prices in the first weeks of the new season but prices have since moved up and are expectedgenerally to exceed those of last year.(b) Pears. The area of pears appears to be levelling out following aslow decline in recent years and is estimated at 5,190 hectares(12,800 acres) in 1976/77. This year saw the heaviest crop for anumber of years, although dry weather conditions resulted in alarge proportion of small fruit. Although prices are lower than last year&apos;s, the much heavier crop has given higher returns overall.(c) Cauliflowers. The area of cauliflowers continues to decline follow-ing the high levels of the late 1960s and is estimated at 14,340hectares (35,400 acres) in 1976/77. The poor growing conditions have led to a fall in output of cauliflowers and to variations in quality. Prices in 1976/77 are expected to be slightly up on lastyear&apos;s levels.(d) Tomatoes. The glasshouse area devoted to tomato production isexpected to decline slightly to 890 hectares (2,200 acres) butcontinued improvements in growing techniques resulted in increasedyields and production remained steady. Prices for 1976/77 areexpected to be significantly up on last year&apos;s levels.Hops (Tables 2, 5, 12 and 27)26. The area under hops has been declining steadily in recent years,mainly because of the improved utilisation of hops by brewers and increasedyields from new hop varieties. There are now signs that the area is stabilisingand in 1977 it is not expected to be below last year&apos;s. The unusually dryweather conditions in 1976 limited the expected increase in yields fromplantings of improved varieties and there was a slight fall in total production.PART III-GENERAL DEVELOPMENTSFarm structure (Table 3)27. The number of farms in the United Kingdom continues to decline.The total number of agricultural holdings, at 270,000, is some 9% lower
than in 1971. The number of full-time farms (166,000) is some 10% lower,the fall in numbers being most marked among the smaller full-time farms.Businesses capable of providing full-time work for at least one man account for over 94% of total output, though in Northern Ireland and Wales theoutput of part-time farms is rather more significant than in other parts ofthe United Kingdom. About one-third of holdings have businesses capableof providing work for at least two men (ie those of 600 standard man-days or more) but they account for 79% of total output, while large businesses(1,200 standard man-days or more), although only about 15% of the totalnumber, produce rather more than a half of total output.28. The average size of farms is increasing. Full-time businesses averaged101 hectares (total area including rough grazings) in 1976 compared with94 hectares in 1971. Individual enterprises are also expanding as the numberof units declines and the trend to greater specialisation continues. Between1971 and 1976 the average area of cereals has increased from 28 to 31hectares; the average dairy herd has risen from 31 to 42 cows and theaverage beef breeding herd from 14 to 18 cows; the average ewe flock hasincreased from 142 to 165 breeding sheep; and the average pig breedingherd from 16 to 25 sows.29. In Great Britain 62% of agricultural holdings were wholly or mainlyowner-occupied in 1976 compared with 54% in 1960/61. The proportion ofthe total area held by owner-occupiers has increased from 52% in 1960/61to 56% in 1976. In Northern Ireland virtually all farmers are owner-occupiers.Index of net product (Table 19)30. For 1975/76 the index is now put at 108 (average of 1968/69-1971/72= 100), instead of 102 as previously forecast, due to a higher value ofproduction of milk and livestock than was previously expected. following the drought, it is forecast to fall further to 97 in 1976/77.Labour productivity (Tables 4 and 19)31. The effect of the weather on output is reflected in the index of labour productivity (the volume of gross product at constant prices per head)which has fallen in the last two years. The latest estimates indicate anaverage annual rate of increase of 3i% for the period 1966/67 to 1976/77compared with A\% for the period 1965/66 to 1975/76. The decline in numbers of regular whole-time workers was about 5% per annum in thelate 1960s and has averaged about 3i% per annum since 1971. At June1976, compared with 1975, the numbers of regular whole-time male and female workers fell by about 3% and 12% respectively.Net income of the industry (Tables 19, 21 and 24)32. Aggregate net income of the industry, including stock appreciation,rose by 28% in 1975/76 to  1,676 million; a very large part of this increaseaccrued to potato growers. Aggregate net income is expected to increase by
about 41% to  1,751 million in 1976/77. Adjusted for normal weather,income would have been higher by about 13%, rising from  1,600 million in 1975/76 to  1,805 million in 1976/77. After a fall of 10% in 1974/75,aggregate net income in real terms rose by 31% in 1975/76; and a fall of about 9% is forecast for 1976/77.33. Samples of farm accounts show that in 1975/76 there were againbig differences in income movements between types of farms and between different parts of the United Kingdom. The accounts end, on average, inFebruary and reflect the substantial variations in livestock valuations (at market prices) during recent years. For these and other reasons they showdifferent net income movements from the aggregate net income series. Ondairy farms, after the substantial decline during the previous two years,net income per farm rose sharply in all countries as a result of higher milk and cattle prices and big increases in livestock valuations. Higher cattle and sheep prices, together with increases in livestock valuations, also contributed to a good recovery in net income in all countries on cattle and sheep farms(which in Great Britain are mainly in hill and upland areas), particularlyin Northern Ireland where average net income had fallen by 1974/75 tothe lowest level for nearly 10 years. In real terms, average net incomes in1975/76 in the dairy and cattle and sheep sectors were still mostly belowthe level of 1972/73. Poor sowing and growing conditions for cereals werereflected in a fall in net income on cereal farms in England, but on othercropping farms in England and Scotland very high potato prices and increased receipts from sugar beet and cattle more than offset higher costs and net income on these farms increased substantially. Incomes also roseon pig and poultry farms.34. In 1976/77, average net income per farm is expected to increase onmost types of farm but the effects of the drought will cause great variation,especially on dairy, cattle and sheep and arable farms. For these types,many farms in Scotland, Northern Ireland and England north of the Humberare likely to do better than in Wales and southern England. Net income is expected to rise on dairy farms, despite higher feed costs, except in theareas affected by drought, where it may fall. Rearers of cattle and sheep,especially in hill and upland areas, should show a further rise in net incomeas a result of increased prices for stores and ewes but for some fattenersheavier feed bills caused by the drought, together with higher store prices,may reduce net income. On many cropping farms yields per hectare havebeen low but higher prices for cereals and a further rise in potato prices are expected to increase net income, especially in Scotland. Incomes onpig and poultry farms are expected to fall, with specialist pig producersshowing a bigger decline than poultry and egg holdings.Cost changes (Table 26)35. Cost increases since the last Review are assessed at  895 million forall products, the chief items being  460 million on the costs of feedingstuffs, 151 million on machinery costs,  72 million on seeds and  60 million on labour.
Gross capital formation (Table 23)36. It is estimated that there will be a further small increase in the valueof new investment in the 1976 calendar year. Total gross capital formationin landlord and tenant-type physical assets together is forecast at  1,176million at current prices in 1976. Of this,  448 million is estimated to be inplant, machinery and vehicles, a rise of 18% over the amount invested in1975, and  497 million in additions to stocks and work-in-progress. new investment in buildings and works (normally landlord-type assets) isexpected to amount to  231 million. In volume terms, new investment in1976 in plant, machinery and vehicles is expected to be between 2% and3% lower than in 1975, and that in buildings and works to be some 19%lower. During 1976 the physical level of stocks and work-in-progress isexpected to be below that of 1975. Following improvements in conditions,coverage and rates of grants from 1 June 1976 the number of applicationsunder the Farm Capital Grant Scheme increased by about a third andunder the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme tenfold, comparedwith a year earlier. Most of this work would be for completion in 1977 and later years.Agricultural land prices37. The average price for all sales of agricultural land of 4 hectaresand over in England and Wales, as reported to the Inland Revenue, was 1,086 per hectare ( 439 per acre) for the six-month period ended September1976. This compares with a price of  1,076 per hectare ( 435 per acre) forthe period ended March 1976 and  1,109 per hectare ( 449 per acre) for theperiod ended September 1975. Because of the delay between a sale being agreed and its notification to the Inland Revenue, this series is subject to atime lag of several months. Later information, however, shows that there hasbeen a steady increase in land prices during 1976, although prices arestill below the record levels reached in 1973/74.Farm rents (Table 22)38. Provisional results from the Agricultural Rent Enquiry show averagefarm rents in England and Wales to be about 17% higher in October 1976than in October 1975. The increase in average rents in Scotland was very similar.Farm workers&apos; earnings (Table 20)39. In the year ended 30 September 1976 the average earnings of full-time hired men in the UK were  48.80 per week. In money terms this is some 19% higher than in the previous year but, in real terms, it is a fall of about i%. These higher earnings partly reflect the July 1975 increases in minimum rates (in England and Wales and Northern Ireland) and the 6 increases in minimum rates awarded in the winter of 1975/76. average weekly earnings in the farm year 1976/77 are expected to be about  53 perfull-time man.
Public expenditure (Table 25)40. In 1976/77, as in 1975/76, the estimated outturn of expenditure on united Kingdom price guarantees, grants and subsidies (excluding thebrucellosis incentives and payments connected with the milk subsidy) isabout  201 million. Calf subsidy payments are down because of a decreasein the rates of payment but payments to hill farmers are up because of anincrease in the rates and a carry-over from 1975/76.41. Expenditure under the common market organisation of the EECis estimated to fall by some  181 million to about  130 million in 1976/77compared with  311 million in 1975/76. This expenditure by the Inter-vention Board for Agricultural Produce includes the beef premium scheme,import and export refunds, certain production subsidies, the gross cost ofaids to private storage and the net cost of commodities bought into inter-vention and subsequently sold. Some of this expenditure benefits consumersrather than producers. The reduced cost in 1976/77 is mainly because,since 17 May 1976, monetary compensatory amounts in respect of imports into the UK from other e.c. countries (except Italy) have been paid toexporters instead of importers. In addition, higher market prices for beefwill result in lower total payments under the beef premium scheme in1976/77 than in 1975/76.Taxation42. The various changes in the capital transfer tax which wereincorporated in the 1976 Finance Act, more particularly the 30% businessrelief, provided a substantial additional relief to the industry.
APPENDIXStatistical TablesThe tables follow the pattern of those in last year&apos;s White Paper and figures areagain expressed in metric terms. Where appropriate, however, a column giving imperialfigures for 1976/77 has also been included. The 1976 June census was the first to be conducted in metric terms. The metric units used in this Appendix are as follows:Area    hectareWeight  tonnekilogram (kg)Volume litreSome of the figures in this Appendix differ from those in previous Annual review white Papers because of later information, changes in the scope and nature of available data and improvements in statistical methods. Forecasts for 1976/77 are asat November 1976.All figures relate to the United Kingdom, unless otherwise stated.Figures for imports from and exports to the Eight relate throughout to the countries of the enlarged European Community (Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany,the Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands).Significant items of Channel Islands trade are shown separately in the tables.Figures for exports include re-exports.Figures for total new supplies take no account of changes in opening and closingstocks which can considerably affect net off take for consumption.In some cases figures may not add to the totals shown because of roundings.Symbols:  means &quot;nil&quot;... means &quot;negligible&quot; (less than half the last digit shown).. means &quot;not available&quot; or &quot;not applicable&quot;.

(a) The coverage for 1973 and onwards includes all known holdings in the United Kingdom with 40 standard man-days or more (a standard man-day (smd) represents 8 hours productive work by an adult male worker underaverage conditions). All holdings with less than 40 smd in Scotland arc excluded. In England and Wales andNorthern Ireland holdings with less than 40 smd are excluded only if they have less than 10 acres of crops and grass and no regular whole-time worker. The same criteria applied in Great Britain in the years 1970 to1972, except that the threshold for standard labour requirements in those years was 26 smd; prior to 1970,the figures related to all known agricultural holdings exceeding one acre in extent. The figures for NorthernIreland before 1973 related to holdings of one acre or more, except for numbers of livestock which were collected from all owners, irrespective of the size of the holding, as well as from landless stockholders. Theintroduction of the changes of definition in Northern Ireland in 1973, following similar changes in GreatBritain which excluded some 14,000 statistically insignificant holdings in 1970 and about 8,000 in 1973, hadthe net result of eliminating about 6,000 or so holdings from the Northern Ireland census.(b) For threshing.(c) Includes small area of soft fruit grown under orchard trees in England and Wales,(rf) Hardy nursery stock, bulbs and flowers.(e) Most of the difference between total horticultural area and the sum of individual sectors is made up by theglasshouse area.(/) Includes areas of other crops and bare fallow not shown in the table.(s)  Includes lucerne.(h)  Before 1975 collected as:in England and Wales &quot;clover, sainfoin and temporary grasses&quot;;in Scotland &quot;grass under seven years old&quot;;in Northern Ireland &quot;1st, 2nd and 3rd year&quot;.(0   Before 1975 collected as:in England and Wales &quot;permanent grass&quot;;in Scotland &quot;grass seven years uld and over&quot;;in Northern Ireland &quot;4th year or older&quot;.O) Includes common rough grazings.(A:) Returns of &quot;other land&quot; were collected for the first time in England and Wales in June 1969. From June 1969to June 1973 &quot;other land&quot; in Great Britain was collected as woodland and areas under roads, yards, buildings,etc., the use of which was ancillary to the farming of the land; in Northern Ireland it included land withinagricultural holdings which was under bog, water, roads, buildings, etc., and waste land not used for agriculture. In June 1974 the definition was changed in England and Wales to include all other land forming part of the holding and in Scotland it was extended to include ponds and derelict land. The Northern Irelanddefinition is unchanged.

The figures included for Northern Ireland in the first two sections for both years relate onlyto holdings with 50 smd or more.For the purpose of this table the size groups in hectares for 1971 have been derived from acreage sizegroups as follows:HectaresUnder 4Under 8Under 204 and under 20Acresito 9ii to 19$i to 49$10 to 49$20 to 99$50 to 149*50 and over100 and over150 to 299$300 and over8 and under 4020 and under 6020 and over40 and over60 and under 120120 and overCM(c)(rf)00if)(*)(A)(0(7)The average size of holding in 1976, based on total area, was 65.7 hectares, of which 45.3 hectares were crops and grass.These figures include holdings with no crops and grass area, which are excluded from the first section of this table.250 smd in Scotland: 200 smd in Northern Ireland.The figures relate to the total area including &quot;other land&quot;, the definition of which has changed slightly between1971 and 1976.Includes an estimate of upwards of 14,000 full-time farms which have under 275 smd (or equivalent) basedon their cropping and stocking and assuming average labour usage.

The occupiers&apos; investmentincludes all tenant-type physical assets in livestock, crops, machinery, etc., but excludes any financial assets and all landlord-type assets such as land and buildings. The estimates of aggregate net income include a profitin recent years of about  8 million on the production of food for consumption in the farm household. Inother industries the corresponding sums are not treated as profit and are relatively much smaller (in manycases non-existent). These figures are not directly comparable with incomes in other sectors of the economy,since farm income also includes elements of wages and changes in stock valuations as well as profits.(b) This is net income at current prices including the change in the volume of stocks and work-in-progress but excluding stock appreciation (i.e. that part of the change in the value of stocks and work-in-progressattributable to the change in the cost of inputs between the beginning and end of year).(c) Net product (net output) measures year-to-year changes in the value-added at constant prices by farmers,landowners and farmworkers to all the goods and services purchased from outside the agricultural sector.(rf) Labour productivity is defined here as gross product per person engaged in agriculture. Gross product isgross output less all inputs other than depreciation, labour, net rent and interest. It is measured here at constant prices. In order to be consistent with national economic conventions, gross product as used in the calculation of labour productivity covers agricultural contractors as well as all commercially significant holdings. Thetotal number of persons engaged in agriculture comprises the number of employees, employers and self-employed recorded in the annual June census taken by the Agricultural Departments. Before 1971, however,the trends in numbers of employers and employees were estimated respectively from the Population Censusesand the Department of Employment count of national insurance cards.Table 20Average earnings and hours of agricultural workers (a)Years ended September	1972	1973	1974	1975	1976Earnings   per week (6) Hours per week (c)   ......	22-60 47-2	26-42 47-6	31-95 46-2	40-84 45-9	48-80 45-5(a) For all hired regular whole-time men.(b) Earnings include pay for statutory holidays and payments-in-kind which are valued at rates set down by theAgricultural Wages Boards and comprise houses, milk, potatoes, etc. (the principal one being houses, most ofwhich were, in England and Wales, valued at 30p before 17 January 1972, 50p up to and including 19 January1976 and  1.50 thereafter).(c) All hours worked and statutory holidays.Net income, net product and labour productivityAll commercially significant holdingsJune/May years

In practice, however,there are many variations in the division between the two responsibilities. Investment in plant and machinery is normally tenant-type. Investment in buildings and works is normally landlord-type.The figures in the table represent gross expenditure before crediting any grants which reduce the cost to theowner or occupier. Annual charges in the form of depreciation are made for these items in calculatingaggregate farming net income.(b) Closing value minus opening value (Table 21) adjusted to approximate calendar year basis.

They are weighted averages based on census distribution of agricultural holdings by type of farming and size of business. More detailed figures for England and Wales will bepublished in &quot;Farm Incomes in England and Wales 1975/76&quot;, for Scotland in &quot;Scottish AgriculturalEconomics 1977&quot;, for Northern Ireland in &quot;Farm Incomes and Investment in Northern Ireland 1975/76&quot;,and for Wales in the &quot;Supplement to the Annual Digest of Welsh Statistics 1975/76&quot;. Net income is defined as for the aggregate net income calculation (Tables 19 and 21), except that here net income includes stockappreciation assessed at current market prices, and is calculated before deduction of interest on any com-mercial debt. All farms are treated as rented and an impu*ed rental value is charged as an expense in the accounts of owner-occupiers. The accounts relate in the main to calendar years or to the year ending 5 April.The average year-ending date is about mid-February.(b) Includes &quot;mixed&quot; farm type but excludes &quot;pigs and poultry&quot;, &quot;cropping&quot; and &quot;horticultural&quot; farm types.(c) Provisional figures.(d) Almost all farm businesses in Northern Ireland are based on owner-occupied holdings. As rents cannot beimputed with reference to tenanted farms, the rental charges entered for owned land and buildings have been assessed in relation to estimated sale value. Where land was taken in conacre, the actual rents paid have been included. For these reasons the average net incomes per farm are not on the same basis as those for GreatBritain.(c)  Includes &quot;cattle, sheep, and pms&quot;, &quot;pigs and poultry&quot; and &quot;cropping&quot; farm types.Specimen net incomes for different types of farm (a)

(a) This table excludes expenditure which may benefit farmers but where the value to them is not shown by theexpenditure (eg expenditure on animal disease and pest control or on research, advice and education). Thefigures for years up to and including 1974/75 represent actual expenditure recorded in the AppropriationAccounts. The figures for 1975/76 are subject to confirmation and those for 1976/77 are the latest estimates of expenditure.(b) Payments in respect of cereals, wool and potatoes relate partly to the crops or clip of the year indicated andpartly to the crops or clips in the preceding year or years. The figures shown in brackets reflect the arrangements with the British Wool Marketing Board, whereby deficiency payments made by the Exchequer are repayablefrom surpluses (excess of market price over guaranteed price) up to the amount of debt owing by the board to Ministers.(c) Payments on milk reflect the government-ncnt policy of holding down the retail price of milk. For public expenditure purposes, they have been attributed to expenditure under the price guarantees in 1972/73 and1973/74 and shown in the body of the table above, but for subsequent years the expenditure has been attri-buted to the food subsidies programme.(d) Farmers in special areas are also eligible for additional assistance under the Farm and Horticulture Dcvelop-ment Scheme and the Farm Capital Grant Scheme. The estimated benefit is shown separately in section 111of the table.(c) Includes grants in respect of investment on self-propelled machines (agricultural and horticultural), co-operation and credit, forage groups, small horticultural production businesses, small farmers, farm businessrecords, water supply, agricultural drainage and special assistance to livestock producers.(/) The 1976/77 forecast comprises expenditure of  41.4 million on cattle and  36.7 million on sheep. Someunavoidable delay in payments in 1975/76 resulted in a carryover of  16.4 million into 1976/77.(g) Includes grants for improvement of hill land and livestock rearing land, rural roads, producers in the ScottishIslands, crofting improvements, hill cattle agistmcnt subsidy and hill livestock and young stock scheme.(h) The figures shown are total expenditure before allowing for receipts from FEOGA which are shownseparately at the foot of the table. The figures are made up oi several elements and include import refunds(net of export levies) on intra-Community trade, import and export refunds on third country trade, the beefpremium scheme, aid for private storage and animal feed, certain production subsidies and the net cost of commodities bought into intervention and subsequently sold. The figures for 1974/75, 1975/76 and 1976/77include the special import subsidy on sugar. Much of the expenditure benefits consumers rather than producers.The consumer subsidy on butter is not included.(0 Includes eggs, poultry meat, fruit and vegetables, oilseeds, hops, herbage seeds, dehydrated fodder andfisheries. Also includes expenditure on products covered by the CAP but not produced to any significantextent in the United Kingdom (rice, wine, flax and hemp).
