CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER ITffiPBNCE POLICY101.     The defence of the United Kingdom remains firmly based on theNorth Atlantic Alliance, since it is only through collective effortthat the West can ensure its own defence and, by deterring aggression,contribute to world peace.102.     The Governments policy, therefore, is to concentrate itsdefence effort on the Alliance and to deploy the Armed Forces ofthe United Kingdom in the areas in which they can make the most significant contribution to the security of the Alliance and, throughthat, to national security; it judges these to be the EasternAtlantic and Channel, the Central Region on the mainland of Europe,the security of the United Kingdom base, and the strategic nuclear deterrent.   During 1976, commitments outside the Alliance have beenEduced and the concentration of defence resources on the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) has continued.1Q3.     The Government has, however, found it necessary in the pastye*r to reduce planned defence expenditure as part of its policy to*e*Uce public expenditure generally.   To bring down the level of^hlic sector borrowing and to free resources for industry, the******* announced in July 1976 a reduction of nearly  1,000 millionift Public expenditure planned for 1977/73 and in December 1976 furtherAuctions of about  1,000 million and  1,500 million in public6xPenditure for 1977/73 and 1978/79.104-     The importance of achieving these savings was such that the government^mment decided that the defence programme could not be excluded^ making its contribution to them.   Defence expenditure for
CONFIDENTIAL1977/78 was accordingly reduced by  100 million in July 1976 and bya further  100 million in December 1976, when a cut of  230 million in the planned defence budget for 1978/79 was also announced.105.     The savings in 1977/78 will be spread over a wide range ofexpenditure.    Of the total of  200 million, about  75 million willbe found from the equipment programme, mainly through defermentof projects but also through selective cancellations.   Worksexpenditure will be reduced by  64 million, mainly at the expenseof new construction; projects affecting operational capability orlinked with restructuring of the Services will be given priority for the reduced funds available.   The balance of the required saving3will be found partly from miscellaneous reductions, includingresearch and development (R&amp;D) expenditure and support and adminis&apos;fcrc&apos;costs of various kinds, and for the rest through a revised assessmentthe level of expenditure now expected on the defence programme as a whole.    Studies are in hand to decide how best to achieve thereduction of  230 million in 1978/79 and decisions will not be taken for some time.    In the search for savings the Government&apos;s over-riding objective will be to keep to the minimum the effect of the reductions on our front-line contribution to the Alliance; therewill be early consultation with NATO.106.     After these reductions have been made, the defence budget wilbe  5,447 million for 1977/78 and  5^03 million for 1978/79 at1976 Survey prices.   This expenditure will support a defence programme which will enable the Government to fulfil its- 2 -CONFIDENTIAL
cCONFIDENTIALPolicy of maintaining modern and effective forces and of continuing to make a very substantial contribution to the capability and securityof the Alliance.0?;.     The need for the Alliance to contribute substantial resources0 defence still remains.    competente has reduced the political tensionse&quot;tween East and West but has not yet resulted in a lessening ofllitary confrontation.    On the contrary, as will be shown later, the^-litary power of the Warsaw Pact continues to grow both in quantityQuality.    There is no evidence to suggest that NATO&apos;s policy*&quot; deterrence is failing and that the Warsaw Pact is contemplatingaSgression against NATO.    But political intentions can change rapidly,Wnereas military capability can only be altered over a long period.evertheless it would be wrong for Britain to try to sustain a defence^&quot;tribution out of proportion to her economic strength.    The attemptu m the long run have adverse effects on our security, since our^ility to make an effective defence contribution depends on the^rerigth of the economy.    The reductions which the Government has feltCelled to make in planned defence expenditure in 1977/73 and&quot;V79 reflect solely the national economic outlook for the period the fact that recovery from recession has been slower than6x5ected.DETENTE AND DISARMAMENTArms control and disarmament negotiations are continuing in56verai* areas but progress during the year has been disappointing.i*^gj-Q Arms LimitationThe Governments of the United States and the Soviet Union- 3 -CONFIDENTIAL
have continued their negotiations on the detailed provisions of anew comprehensive agreement on strategic offensive weapons.   TheBritish Government is kept informed of progress by the United states in the North Atlantic Council and looks forward with keen interestto a successful conclusion of these negotiations, since strategicstability is essential for the further development of detente in east/West relations.Force Reductions in Central Europe110.     Negotiations on the mutual and balanced reduction of forcesin central Europe (MBFR) are now in their fourth year but progreshas been disappointingly slow.   The agreed aim of the negotiation6is to contribute to a more stable relationship in the area at a level of forces, without damaging the security of East or West.pili^Allied proposals for mutual reductions to a common collective ce-ion the ground and air manpower of the Warsaw Pact and of NATO, 3X1for the withdrawal of a Soviet tank army, are designed to redres      ^major de-stabilising imbalances between the two sides.    The addi&apos;fclWestern proposals of December 1975, including an offer to withdraw&amp;wfrom the reductions area significant numbers of American nucleardefl^d*weapons, represent a reasonable compromise between the initialof both sides.    By contrast the Eastern proposals, involving a 101of equal percentage and equal numerical reductions, have not beer1significantly modified and would merely serve to give permanentstatus to the existing imbalances at a lower level of forces.West111.     At the outset of the negotiations in November 1973 the &quot;- 4 -confidential confidential

The Warsaw Pact participantsAlined to discuss data and did not table figures of their own^til June 1976, after which the Western participants responded bytabling the latest data on their ground and air force manpower in^e area.   There are significant discrepancies between the figuresPut forward by the East and Western assessments of Warsaw Pact forceevels in the area.    It is hoped that the East will now be willingto engage in a detailed discussion of data with a view to reachingaSreement 0n figures,lipThere is as yet no sign that the Warsaw Pact participantsare nPrepared to undertake the necessary manpower reductions to produceoutcome of parity between the two sides.   However, the MBFR talks6a**ly remain an important part of the East/West dialogue and thevernment will therefore continue to strive for the achievement of itA,*8 objective and to press for a positive and successful outcome.TheJOVernment has no intention, in advance of mutual and balanced* 0y*e preductions, of reducing the forces which are maintained on the inland of Europe in accordance with its Brussels Treaty obligations,- gence on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)113^   &apos;     The signing of the Final Act of the CSCE in Helsinki on^uSUst 1975 constituted an important landmark in the process of&quot; -^ it) by establishing a basis for the further development of10ns between the participating States.   The test of the success- 5 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALof the CSCE will, however, lie in the extent to which the provisionsof the Final Act are carried out; progress on the implementation ofthe Final Act and on the improvement of security and the developmentof co-operation in Europe will be reviewed by the participatingStates in Belgrade in the second half of 1977.114.     The Final Act of the CSCE contained certain military confidencebuilding measures designed to enhance stability in Europe by reducingthe possibility of military miscalculation and misunderstanding.They include the voluntary prior notification of major militarymanoeuvres in Europe involving more than 25,000 troops and, on amore discretionary basis, the invitation of observers to militarymanoeuvres, the notification of smaller scale manoeuvres and ofmilitary movements, and exchanges of military personnel.115.     Since the signing of the Final Act, NATO countries havenotified six major manoeuvres and seven smaller scale manoeuvres;observers have been invited to five of these.    In each case obserVeI&quot;from Warsaw Pact countries were invited but did not attend.    warsaw pact countries have given prior notification of three major manoeuVto which they invited observers from those countries in the immediatevicinity of the exercise area.    The Warsaw Pact has also given pi*l0rnotification of two smaller scale manoeuvres at 24 hours notice orless.    Neutral and non-aligned participants in the CSCE have also Ptheir part in implementing the confidence-building provisions ofthe Final Act.116.     &quot;British troops have taken part in several of the exercisesnotified by NATO countries.

InAugust 1976 we tabled in the CCD a draft convention on the prohibition0 fthe development, production and stockpiling of chemical weaponsQn their destruction.    In the United Kingdom military work ins area is devoted only to defensive measures, which will continueDe necessary as long as other States possess chemical weapons.The^raft convention seeks to bring together the work done at theand elsewhere, in particular on the definition of chemical warfarets and on verification techniques, and aims to give further^tus -t0        negotiations, in order to secure a comprehensive and liable prohibition of the production, stockpiling and use ofchemiCSTAV-ai weapons.At the United Nations, the United Kingdom supported a proposalne holding of a special session of the Assembly devoted toarmament.   The Government believes that such a session, if properlyeQ-* could improve the prospects for multilateral disarmamentlations and looks forward to playing its part.- 7 -confidential confidential
confidential the MILITARY CAPABILITY OF THE WARSAW PACT119.      In spite of their public commitment to detente and disarmament,the nations of the Warsaw Pact continue to devote a large amount oftheir resources to sustain their military capability.    Despite its dato have reduced its defence expenditure, over the last three years it is estimated that the military expenditure of the Soviet Unionhas grown by some five per cent a year in real terms.    It is calculated that the Soviet Union is allocating 11-12 per cent ofits gross national product (GNP) to military programmes.   Althoughthe percentage of GNP devoted to defence is at best only a roughguide to the level of resources devoted to defence, this proportion of GNP is very much higher than that allocated by anyNATO country, and highlights the continuing priority given to military programmes in the Soviet Union over the last decade.    Theresults of this effort were discussed in detail in the 1975 Statemerl(Cmnd 5976) and the 1976 Statement (Cmnd 6432) on the Defence Estimaall evidence suggests that this momentum is being maintained.120.     Figure 1 illustrates significant features of re-equipment asit has affected the Soviet Northern Fleet, the main threat to NATOin the Atlantic.    Not only has there been an increase in offensivecapability resulting from the introduction of nuclear-poweredsubmarines and missile-armed warships and aircraft but also, becauseolder vessels have been retained, overall numbers have increased.The first aircraft carrier of the Kiev class carried out its- 8 -CONFIDENTIAL

The overall picture of these increases is summarised at Figure 2.

CONFIDENTIALalready formidable tactical nuclear capability is also beingconsiderably increased.    These improvements apply in particular toTactical Air Armies facing the Central Region of NATO, where theincrease in combat strength since 1963 (see Figure 2) is equivalentto the addition of seven air regiments.    The introduction ofthree new types of swing-wing tactical aircraft, which can deliverboth conventional and nuclear weapons, is particularly significant.The weapon loads of these aircraft are double those of their predecessors and their greater operating range enables the TAF to^ach targets much deeper into NATO territory than hitherto,Eluding parts of the United Kingdom.    The Long-Range Air Forcecontinues to take delivery of Backfire bombers, markedly increasingits capability.123.     m the nuclear missile field, the Soviet Union is about to deploy the new SS-X-20 intermediate-range ballistic missiles.*fc*e missiles are road-mobile and carry multiple independently-targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs); they are capable of reaching^7 major target in Europe.

A submarine-launched missile with a MIRV capability is6xPected to enter service soon.^     In addition, the Soviet Union has the support of its Warsaw- 11 -CONFIDENTIAL

The main task of the navies of East Germany and Poland,the most important of the Non-Soviet Warsaw Pact (NSWP) navies,is to assist the Soviet Navy in the control of their own coastal waters; however both have substantial amphibious assault forces.The total strength of these navies has remained largely static inrecent years, although re-equipment continues to increase theireffectiveness.    The armies of East Germany, Poland and Czechoslovak!8,include a high proportion of combat-ready divisions; these aretrained, organised and equipped on the Soviet model, and are avail&apos;able to support the formidable Soviet forces facing NATO&apos;s CentralRegion.    NSWP air forces are mainly organised for air defence andare integrated into the Soviet air defence system; they thereforeprovide air defence in depth for the Soviet Union.    They also main&quot;taloffensive elements for tactical support of ground forces.NATO RESPONSE125.     To counter the military and political threat from the warsaw pact, the United Kingdom and its Allies co-operate in the north atlantic Alliance.    This is not solely a military organisation; xhas an important role in the pursuit of detente as well as for defence.    Its members are committed to contributing towards thedevelopment of peaceful and friendly international relations bystrengthening their free institutions, by bringing about a better understanding of the principles upon which these institutions arefounded, and by promoting conditions of stability and well-being&apos;They have undertaken to refrain from the threat or use of force ^ntheir international relations in any manner inconsistent with thepurposes of the United Nations.- 12 -confidential confidential
CONFIDENTIAL^6.     But states that wish to preserve peace have never achievedthat aim by neglecting their own security.   The Alliance must beready with sufficient military forces to deter and, if necessary,resist aggression.   The members are resolved, separately and jointly,D7 means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, tomaintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack; and they have bound themselves to regard anyarmed attack in Europe or North America against one or more of them as an attack against them all.127&apos;*     Military power is regarded by the Soviet Union as a legitimate^ important diplomatic weapon and there can be little doubt thatthe Soviet Union could exploit to the full the opportunities whichWould be offered by any weakening of Western political and economic^ability or by any further shift in their favour in the military^lationship between East and West in Europe.12qThus NATO&apos;s forces must serve both a military and a political^^rpose.   They must promise a collective defence against any military aggression, and they must underpin the confidence of eachetober State that the Alliance would collectively resist any attempt by 4.-.ne Soviet Union to derive political advantage from its militaryeminence over a single member, or groups of members, of the AlliancTo deter aggression and to defend the independence and-^orial integrity of the members of the Alliance should aggressionVei&quot;theless occur - whether as the result of a miscalculation, ora deliberate attack launched on the assumption that the Allies- 13 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwould not be willing to resist effectively - NATO has evolved the strategy of flexibility in response.130.     This strategy recognises that effective deterrence depends upon the manifest ability and will of the Alliance to respond in 3X1appropriate manner to aggression of any kind.    The nature of the response will inevitably vary according to the circumstances.    Givethe current size, posture and capability of Warsaw Pact militarydeployments and the advantage of initiative which an aggressorautomatically has, it is unrealistic to expect NATO to have sufficient forces in place to be able to deal effectively with eve^form of attack in every location without ever needing to escala^the level of conflict.    Moreover the knowledge that NATO is prepato escalate and to use all elements of its forces in its own selfdefence is itself an important deterrent in convincing a potenti3--&apos;&apos;aggressor that the risks involved in any military adventure areout of proportion to the gains.    Nevertheless, the fear of escala&apos;tcannot, on its own, suffice as a deterrent.    At a time when the*&quot;eis broad parity in strategic nuclear weapons between NATO and ^eWarsaw Pact, and when both sides deploy a similar range of theanuclear forces, the Alliance must maintain an adequate convenor-capability.    If NATO were patently unable to sustain a stalwartconventional defence against conventional attack, its enemies n11^.     0vvuwell conclude that an Alliance v/hich was so neglectful of itssecurity would be unlikely to have the collective determinati01escalate a conflict to the nuclear level; they might thus be persuaded to take the risk of launching a conventional attack-- 14 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL13L     NATO therefore needs in sufficient measure conventional forces,**clear forces for tactical purposes, and strategic nuclear forces.E** element of this triad has its own role to play in deterringSession, and each is needed to support the other two.   Adequatec^conventional forces are required to repel limited conventional attacksto impose delay and inflict serious losses on large-scaleco*conventional attacks, thereby demonstrating to the aggressor thetermination of the Alliance to defend itself, making credible tohi* the risks of escalation that he is running, and providing time* dithediplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict.   They serve to keepNuclear threshold high.    But adequate theatre nuclear forcesalej-so required to deter an aggressor from tactical use of nuclearns (either from the outset or should he find subsequently thathis com&quot;conventional forces were not succeeding) and to enhance the^erren-nagainst conventional attack.   The decision to use them,Wou-ld take account of the entire situation and not just the^dia+o^    tactical position, would be aimed above all at convincingogressor of the firm resolution of the Alliance and at causinghl* torecognise the risk of further escalation to the level of all-Uclear war, and so to desist from aggression.

On land, the Alliance must be able todefend the whole of the area it embraces.    This not only requiressubstantial ground and air forces; it also emphasises the importanceof forward defence: otherwise an aggressor might be able to seizeterritory swiftly without cost to himself, thus confronting theAllies with the need themselves to launch a military counter-attackto restore the position.    So crucial are these tasks to NATCsstrategy that if ever the balance of power were to shift so far infavour of the Warsaw Pact that it had the evident ability to preventtheir implementation by NATO, the effect on Allied confidence andpolitical cohesion would be profound.133*     Although NATO needs powerful ready forces in situ to deterand defend against a sudden attack, the possibility of which cannobe excluded, it is probable that a period of warning would be avail-able.   During such a period, NATO must be able to mobilise rapidlyits full resources and to move reinforcements, both of combat andlogistic support forces, where they might be needed: a particularrequirement would be to strengthen logistic units, many of which iwould be uneconomical to keep at their necessary wartime strength ^time of peace.    Mobilisation of reserves and the rapid movement 0reinforcements would in addition contribute to deterrence bysignifying NATO&apos;s preparedness to resist and, especially where IUfrom one or more Allies were moved to the territories of other allies, by demonstrating NATCs cohesion.- 16 -CONFIDENTIAL

Collectively, throughthe programmes arising from the studies on Alliance Defence in the1970s and on European Defence Improvement, and nationally, improve-*enta have been made and others are being planned.

The strategic and theatre nuclear forces of the United Kingdomform an essential element of NATO&apos;s deterrent capability.141.     In addition, the United Kingdom maintains specialist reinforcement forces wholly committed to the Alliance but separate from those required to bring our forces in Germany to a war footing.    these include land and air contributions to the multi-national ACE MobileForce, which can be deployed anyv/here in Europe, and to the strategic Reserve (Air) of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe(SACEUR); the United Kingdom Mobile Force (UKMF), consisting ofboth land and air forces for use in the Central or Northern regions of ACE or in north-east Italy; and Royal Marines Commando Forces,with amphibious shipping and helicopters, primarily for use in theNorthern Region.142.

Operations in Northern Ireland in support of the civil powercontinue in line with the Governments policy of working towards a situation in which the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) is able tomaintain law and order throughout the Province without assistancefrom the Armed Forces.    This is a gradual process and the armed forces remain heavily committed to operations in support of thepolice, and will continue to be so for as long as is necessary.Baring the past year the Armed Forces have demonstrated that their determination, courage and flexibility are as great as ever,awards for gallantry were made last year to members of british forces in Northern Ireland and 29 soldiers including 15members of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) gave their lives.229.     In January 1976, the Government announced the formation ofa Ministerial Committee to examine the forces required to maintainlav; and order in Northern Ireland in the next few years.    TheSecretary of State for Northern Ireland, in announcing to parliament the results of this examination, emphasised the fundamental import-ance of securing police acceptance and effectiveness throughout the- 44 -confidential confidential
CONFIDENTIALcommunity and of increasing the role of locally recruited forces.Steps have been taken to implement this policy, including a decisionto increase the number of full-time members of the UDR and to employthem on the full range of UDR duties.230.       The upsurge of sectarian attacks in County Armagh at thebeginning of 1976 met with a firm response from the Armed forces which did much to reduce the violence, and the Army has continuedto respond flexibly to a level of violence which has fluctuated &amp;sparticular terrorist organisations have tried to raise the level oftheir criminal activities.   During the past year there have beensigns of a growing revulsion by a majority of the community againstviolence.   The Peace Movement which developed during the second halfof 1976 is evidence of this,231.       The operations of the RUC,. the Army and the UDR are directed towards bringing terrorists to justice through the ordinary procesof the law.    In 1976 1,276 people were charged with terrorist-typeoffences, including     241        with murder or attempted murder.   ^esecurity forces found       837      firearms,       70, 3O6   rounds of am^11ition   and almost   ten      tons of explosive (including neutralise^devices).232.       All three Services are involved in maintaining security,although the major burden of assisting the police inevitably fallson the Army.   The basic force level remained at 13 major units ininfantry role until the end of 1976 when it was reduced to 12;reinforcements were however called in when necessary to meet securequirements.

These forces carry out and sea surveillance and deterrent patrols.     Five new IslandAil,PortclaSssbips, ordered specifically for the offshore task, will bePted into service by the end of the year;    HM Ships Jersey and- 46 -CONFIDENTIAL

These forces are augmentedfrom time to time by other RN ships routed through offshore areas.Contingency plans exist for rapid response to terrorist incidentsand accidents; these could involve RN ships, RN and RAF aircraft,elements of the Royal Marines and explosive ordnance disposal teamstogether with the necessary long-range helicopter lift.    The Service3have co-operated with civil authorities in exercises designed to test the security of offshore oil installations.235.       The Government is also taking part in discussions with othercountries with interests in the North Sea to consider international co--operation in this area.   Delegates from Belgium, Denmark, theFederal Republic of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Norway andthe United Kingdom met in Oslo in June 1976.Fishery Protection1Q/761236.       Following negotiations in Oslo between 30 May and 1 Junea further fishing agreement between the United Kingdom and Icelandwas agreed for a period of six months.   Defence forces were withdra^11beyond 200 miles on 30 May to assist negotiations and were comple1;withdrawn on 1 June.    Tributes were paid to the effectiveness witnwhich the Royal Navy, together with supporting RFAs, and the Royal-Air Force carried out their arduous and difficult duties.237.       Following the extension of United Kingdom fishery limit3 on1 January 1977, the task of the Fishery Protection Squadron hasexpanded considerably.    In coastal waters the Fishery ProtectionSquadron maintains its patrol as in the past, assisted by RN andRAF aircraft; the new task offshore will increasingly be met by- 47CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL325.     Some parts of the research programme have objectives common to both defence and civil interests and the costs are shared with civil authorities.   Other parts, making use of specialised skill9and facilities in defence establishments, are undertaken for civil authorities on direct repayment.   Receipts from both sources are estimated at  23 million to cover expenditure additional to thaton defence research.Organisation of Research326.     The research programme is the responsibility of the Control!61&quot;of R&amp;D Establishments and Research and is organised into 18 majorfields of research such as aerodynamics, electronics, armaments and ships.   Most of the work is carried out in defence-related industrieand the R&amp;D establishments but some support is provided by univej-research laboratories.    Long-term research objectives and policyguidelines for the programme are provided by the Defence research committee and the Central Scientific Staff of the Ministry of DeferlC327.

CONFIDENTIAL328.     The reviews of the future levels of R&amp;D in the Chemical DefenceEstablishment (CDE) and the Microbiological Research Establishment(MRE) have been completed.    It has been concluded that, without detriment to military objectives, R&amp;D effort on defence againstchemical warfare can be reduced to about two-thirds its present size,and the requirements for microbiological research can be met adequatelyby a small team of about ten scientists and their supporting staffintegrated within CDE.   The future of LIRE, whose programme hasincluded substantial elements of civil work, therefore depends onthe scale and range of civil requirements.   These are being studied by the Central Policy Review Staff, having regard to the national interest in securing the most economic deployment of the country&apos;resources and expertise for conducting biological research.    Consulta-tion with Staff Associations and Trades Unions on these reviews is-ontinuing.ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIES329.     The Royal Ordnance Factories organisation has been functioning-toder a Trading Fund for almost three years and, helped by the increased-utonomy which the organisation has over its resources, its methods3f operation in this changed financial environment are now well established.   The present workload of the organisation is healthy with^ estimated output in 1977/73 of some  240 million.    This coversmanufacture of a wide range of defence stores, includingloured vehicles, guns, engineer vehicles and equipment, andMunition of many calibres, for all three Services and for an^creasing number of overseas customers.    Over half of the receipts^ 1977/73 are expected to be from export work, which includes the- 79 -confidential confidential

CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALCHAPTER IVRESERVE AND AUXILIARY FORCES401.     There are two categories of Reserves: Regular and Volunteer.The Regular Reserves comprise ex-Service personnel who are, fora specified period after their return to civilian life, liable forrecall in an emergency.    They provide a source of individualreinforcements with Service experience and are not, in practice,called upon to train (although some have a liability to do so).The Volunteer Reserves consist of men and women, not necessarily with previous Regular service, who have accepted liability for mobilisationln an emergency;    they are organised in units and in addition to theirregular drill commitments they undertake periods of continuoustraining each year.402.     ijne total cost of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces (includingthe Ulster Defence Regiment) and the Cadet Forces in 1977/78 isestimated at  105        million (details are given in Annex B).    Thelengths of these forces are given in Annex G.ROYAL NAVY AND ROYAL MARINES RESERVE FORCES403.     Further progress has been made in tailoring the Volunteer^aval Reserves to their wartime tasks and assimilating them into the^aval Home Command.    The post of Admiral Commanding Reserves lapsed0n 1 January 1977 and the Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command assumedect responsibility for the command and control of the Royal naval reserve (RNR), delegating certain administrative responsibilities to hisArea Plag Officers.    The arrangements for allocating the MCMVs inthe 10th Mine Countermeasures Squadron (10 MCM) during 1976 between- 82-CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfour groups of RNR Divisions worked well.    Next year 10 MCM will consist of six   MCMVs together with two patrol craft which will be allocated during 1977.404.     The Reserve communication training task has been streamlinedand the number of Reserve communications training centres reduced from 19 to 11.405.     The strength of the Volunteer Naval Reserves at October 1976was 2,253 officers and 3*125 ratings.406.     Following the Defence Review, the mobilisation tasks of theRoyal Marines Reserve have now been defined in detail.    Training is designed to provide support for commando forces including reinforce-ment of not&apos;s northern flank in mountain and arctic warfare.    their strength at October 1976 was 66 officers and 863 men.ARMY RESERVES407.     The closer integration of the TAVR with the Regular Army,which was referred to in the 1976 Statement on the Defence Estimates,has been carried a stage further.    The order of battle and roles ofeach unit in the TAVR have been examined in the light of the revisedcommitments of the Army following the Defence Review.    The mainchanges to emerge from this review are that 44 Parachute Brigadewill be disbanded, new roles being found for its units and supportingarms and services; two TAVR battalions together with a number ofService sub-units will be integrated with each of the new Field forces and three battalions currently allocated to the general reserve role in the United Kingdom will be earmarked to reinforce BA0R on mobilisation.
CONFIDENTIAL408.     The strength of the TAVR in 1976 increased from 53,952 on1 January to    60,104     on 31 December.   A contributing factor to thissubstantial improvement was the national publicity campaign in the spring of 1976 which for the first time employed a combination of television and national, regional, and local advertising.^09.     The University Officers Training Corps (UOTC) had a successful^ar, its average strength for the academic year 1975/76 rising by nearly nine per cent over that for the   previous year.    In the 12months to the end of June 1976, 64 commissions in the Regular Armyand 158 TAVR commissions were granted to those who had been membersQ  the UOTC, giving impressive support to the Army&apos;s policy of^cruiting more graduate officers.    A unit of the UOTC was formed atCardiff during the Michaelmas Term - the first such unit in Walessince 1952.ULSTER DEFENCE REGIMENT4l0.     In addition to routine operations throughout the year, thePart-time UDR now provides a company-size force each weekend, availablefQr deployment anywhere in Northern Ireland.    In six Police divisions of the Province the UDR has taken over, in part or wholly, from theReSular Army the task of providing immediate military support to theHlJC.   Four Dattalions are now able to train each year in Britainso benefit from the greater range of facilities available on theFinland. The first of these training periods was held at Warcop inAPril 1976. The strength of the Regiment at 1 January 1977Was C        J including/-   J women. It was announced in-  84 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALDecember 1976 that the number of full-time members in the Regimentwould be increased to give it a greater operational capability indaytime as well as providing administrative and training support.ROYAL AIR FORCE RESERVE FORCES411.     The Royal Air Force will continue to require, in an emerge1the support of some specialist Reserves.    The Regular and VolunteerRoyal Air Force Reserves total   33,500     officers, airmen and anof these approximately 800 are paid Reserves currently committed *0specific emergency duties.CADET FORCES412.     The Cadet Forces are voluntary youth organisations sponsored by the Armed Forces for those between the ages of 12 and 20.    Theiraims are to develop, through an organised programme of training,including adventurous activities, such personal qualities as seJ-discipline and leadership, and to stimulate interest in the Forces-413.     As a result of the review referred to in the 1976 StateisatioPthe Defence Estimates, some changes are being made to the orgamof the Naval Cadet Forces to improve their internal command anavviand to make more efficient use of resources by closer associateprocedures have been modernised and a new training syllabus hasthe Royal Naval command structure.

In the 12 months ending31   March 1977 a total of     41,000     officers, servicemen and service-women are expected to be recruited, compared with 46,906 during thePrevious year.   The lower figure this year is due to reduced require-ments for servicemen by the Royal Navy and the Army because of reducedoutflows and the need to reduce Service numbers to the levels planned for 1979 as announced in the 1975 Statement on the Defence Estimates.5^2.       In addition to the figures in this chapter, detailed manpowerstatistics are given in Annex G,RECRUITMENT OF OFFICERS-^3.       In the Royal Navy the number of officers commissioned fromClvilian life has been generally satisfactory, but there are stillPortages among engineer officers, supplementary aircrew officers and medical officers.    The Royal Marines entry target has once again beenac*iieved.04.       The recruitment of Army officers has improved since last yearand the numbers are now approaching those required.   A variant of theArmy university cadetship scheme has been introduced whereby an under-STaduate may be awarded a bursary covering three years at university,return for which he is required, following graduation, to serve forthree years as a short service commissioned officer.    The numberaPplying has been most encouraging and at the beginning of the academiyear 1976/77 55 cadetships and 45 bursaries had been awarded.    Entryr Sandhurst has increased over the corresponding period last year.-36 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALThe number of qualified doctors recruited remains below target, butthere has been an improvement in the numbers converting from short service to regular commissions.    Recruitment of medical cadets remainspromising and the impetus of the last two years is being maintained.505.       RAF officer   recruiting requirements are higher in 1976/77than in the previous year when a substantial reduction took place aspart of the measures to achieve the post 1979 manpower levels.    Targethave been achieved in most branches, but there has been difficulty in recruiting sufficient direct entry education officers, fighter con-trollers and engineering and medical cadets.506.

The Army Welfare Inquiry Committee established in 1974 underthe chairmanship of Professor J C Spencer of the University of edinburgh has completed its task.   The Committee&apos;s report, which hasbeen carefully studied, has made an invaluable contribution toknowledge on Army welfare problems.   The need to improve welfaresupport for soldiers and their families is accepted, and many of theCommittee*s recommendations have been, or are being, implemented.    11^s been decided not to follow the Committee^ recommendation for anArmy Social Work Service, but two alternatives considered by theCommittee are being explored.

The principal change for Service personnel is anincrease in the powers of Army and RAF commanding officers which willunder certain conditions allow the summary disposal of a case whichwould otherwise have involved court martial proceedings.   A standingcivilian court is being introduced in British Forces   Germany for those civilians, including the dependants of Service personnel, w^0are subject to the Service Discipline Acts.   Powers based on thoseof a magistrate^ court in the United Kingdom will be available both to this court and to courts martial overseas; this will provide agreater measure of flexibility in dealing with civilian offenders.The legal status of members of the Queen Alexandra&apos;s Royal NavalNursing Service and the WRNS will be changed later this year whenthey will become members of Her Majesty*s Naval Forces and subjectto the provisions of the Naval Discipline Act 1957 at all times.These changes will bring their status into line with that of theWomen&apos;s Services of the Army and the Royal Air Force.Service Voting520.       The Representation of the People (Armed Forces) Act1976 will improve the arrangements under which service personnel and their wives    (or husbands)   mayregister as electors.   Under this Act Service personnel and themsteadspouses will be able to register on a once-and-for-all basis, inBof having to re-register every year, and wives (or husbands) willremain Service voters when in the United Kingdom, whereas hithertothey could qualify only when overseas.- 93&quot; -CONFIDENTIAL

To maintain the impetus of the comprehensive review of groundGaining mentioned in the 1976 Statement on the Defence Estimates, aGround Training Committee has been formed to ensure that courses arecritically examined at regular intervals.    Economies are being achieved by concentrating more technical training at RAF Halton.The first three-year course for a new type of apprentice technician,trained in more than one skill to meet the future engineering needsof the Royal Air Force, has been completed.    With the aim of meetingconstantly changing needs in the most effective and economical way,a number of special studies are in hand, notably on initial officertpaining and the training of engineer officers.FLYING TRAINING611 *      Pilots will begin fixed-wing training for the Sea Harrier in19?7.

From 1979 this task will heundertaken in Jetstream aircraft, although the training will continueto be based at RNAS Culdrose.Army614.      The Army Air Corps trains its own pilots and aircrewmen, aswell as those of the Royal Marines Commando Brigade Squadron, largelyunder civilian contract.    The replacement of the Sioux helicopter hythe Gazelle for flying training beyond the basic stage is due to becompleted by May 1977&apos;Royal Air Force615.      RAF pilot training has been improved by the introduction ofnew training equipment: modernisation of cockpit instrumentation inthe Jet Provost fleet was completed in mid-1976 and delivery of theHawk began in November 1976.    Simulators have been integrated intothe syllabus to ensure that maximum benefit is derived from theminimum necessary flying hours.

The independent inquiry into Joint training undertaken byMr E R L Lewis showed that the potential scope for economies throughjoint training, though significant, is relatively small compared withthe total cost of the overall services training programme.   The maincriterion for undertaking joint training should be whether it can provide savings additional to those possible from single-ServiceMeasures.

The operational sea training facilities at Portland arealso increasingly used by ships of other NATO nations.619.     In connection with the Lance missile system American andGerman students have trained during 1976 with their British Armycounterparts at the Army School of Ammunition, and British studentshave attended other Lance training courses at the German TechnicalSchool.    It is expected that next year Belgian, Dutch and Italianstudents will participate in such training.620.     The feasibility of joint training for British, German andItalian Tornado crews has been endorsed for the Royal Air Force andthe German Air Force and Navy; a decision on the extent of ItalianAir Force participation is still awaited.   Meanwhile planning continue for the establishment of a Joint Operational Conversion Unit at RAFCottesmore in 1979.

CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER VIISUPPORT701.     A thoroughgoing review of the nature and role of the armed forces has been one important consequence of the Defence Review.This has resulted in steps to tighten up and streamline the whole of^e support organisation.   Much restructuring has already been under-taken, designed to secure maximum economies while leaving the opera-tional capability of the Armed Forces intact; this process willcontinue.702.     a welcome by-product of this search for economies in thesupport organisation is a reduction in the requirement for realestate.   The restructuring and redeployments which are taking placeWill have the effect not only of increasing the efficiency of the armed Forces but also of releasing property for disposal.    Surplus3-and and buildings are being declared to the Property Services Agency(pSA) of the Department of the Environment as quickly as they can be identified, so that the PSA can in turn dispose of them for alternativeUse.ROYAL  NAVY  SUPPORT ORGANISATION7o3.     Following the Defence Review, a number of studies of the Fleet^Pport organisation were set in hand with the aim of achievingeconomies without reducing the operational efficiency of the Fleet.certain reductions, including the closure of several depots, werebounced in the 1976 Statement on the Defence Estimates.    Studies- 101 -CONFIDENTIAL
completed since then have identified further possible reductions inthe planned staff numbers engaged in Fleet Air Arm support, in the marine Services organisation, in the telecommunications service and royal Naval Supply and Transport Service (RNSTS) facilities.Royal Dockyards704.     The Royal Dockyards have had to undertake&quot;unprogrammed repair work arising, for example, from the Icelandic fisheries dispute;there have also been shortages of skilled labour.    This has meant that the dockyards have been hard pressed to meet their commitmentsduring the year.    There will thus be a backlog of work to be carried into 1977/73 in addition to the programme already planned for thatyear.    The allocation of work will need to be adjusted, so as to achieve the best use of available resources, but each dockyard willcontinue to specialise in particular kinds of work.705-     Work on guided missile destroyers will be concentrated at portsmouth, which will undertake the major refit of HMS Glamorganand the normal refit of two other ships of the County class,HMS Norfolk and HMS Antrim, together with a supporting programmeincluding the refitting of patrol submarines.    The refitting andrefuelling of nuclear submarines will be the major task of Rosyth an-Chatham.    Rosyth will be undertaking the refit of thePolaris submarine, HMS Repulse, while Chatham will be refitting &quot;two-Fleet submarines, HMS Courageous and HMS Valiant.    Both dockyardswill also undertake major work on surface ships and some refittingof patrol submarines.    The Devonport programme will continue to- 102 -confidential confidential
CONFIDENTIALinclude the major share of Leander class frigate refits, togetherwith the completion of the refit of HMS Ark Royal and the docking of nuclear-powered submarines. All four home dockyards will also undertawork on a variety of other vessels and craft.Marine Services706.     The Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service and the Port AuxiliaryService were amalgamated on 1 October 1976 under the title of theformer.   The new streamlined organisation will continue to provideharbour vessels, such as tugs, Fleet tenders and lighters, as wellas ocean-going salvage, towing and research vessels.Royal Naval Supply and Transport Service707.     The RNSTS continues to provide a wide variety of services to the Fleet, and some services, on a rationalised basis,to the Army and Royal Air Force.   Recent studies haveidentified possible economies in RNSTS facilities and staff,a^d several proposals are now being implemented.   A new computersystem for the centralised provisioning and stock control of a large^ange of general stores was successfully introduced in March 1976,and is already beginning to produce inventory savings.- 103 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALNaval Aircraft Repair Organisation (NARO)708.     The Royal Navy is responsible for the repair of the helicopter5of all three Services.    This task is undertaken in the NARO and in industry.    Reductions in planned aircraft requirements following theDefence Review will permit the closure of the RN Aircraft Yard atWroughton (announced in the 1976 Statement on the Defence Estimates)and other staff economies in the NARO.ARMY SUPPORT ORGANISATION7 09&apos;     During the last year substantial progress has been made in assessing the proposals for the Army&apos;s logistic restructuring whichwere announced in the 1976 Statement on the Defence Estimates.   Afterconsultations with the staff interests concerned, decisions to implement the majority of these proposals have been taken, and detailed planning is well advanced.    The new integral logistic conunand control organisation, the Logistic Executive (Army), will beestablished in 1977 at Andover and will provide a more efficient and economic structure for the management of the Army^ logistic support.7 10.

It is expected that all these measures will produce civilian manpower savings in the United KingdomQi some 2,600.    In the Army logistic support area at home andabroad, civilian manpower has already been reduced by about 1,700during the past two years, mainly through reduction overseas in thenumber of locally engaged civilians.    The total civilian staff savings in Army logistic services will in due course amount to some 5,400.ROYAL AIR FORCE SUPPORT ORGANISATION conomy in Support Costs711.     The merger of Support and Training Commands by mid-1977, witha single Command Headquarters at RAF Brampton, is proceeding as planned.712.     The disbandment in August 1976 of the independent RAF QualityAssurance Service and the subsequent reallocation of responsibilitieswithin the Royal Air Force have resulted in significant economiesWithout detriment to standards.713. A computer system for improving the supply management of all types of engines for fixed-wing aircraft used by the three Servicesv;as introduced in September 1976.

The long-term aims are better availability of- 105 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALserviceable equipment and the reduction of maintenance costs.715.     Proposals are being considered for the rationalisation of ground radio engineering tasks which would result in the formationof a Ground Radio Engineering Support Unit at RAF Benson.    The RadioEngineering Unit (less the Test Equipment Wing) at RAF Henlow andthe Ground Radio Servicing Centre at North Luffenham would move toRAF Benson by the early 1980s, although the exact timing of eachmove has yet to be determined.    Support Command Signals headquarters and the Radio Introduction Unit will move from RAF Medmenham toRAF Benson by 1 April 1977.716,     The transfer of aircraft maintenance tasks from RAF MaintenanceUnits (MU) at Aldergrove and Sydenham, leading to the closure of these units by 1 April 1978, will result in significant savings.    Theaircraft engineering tasks previously undertaken at No. 60 MU Leconfieand No. 71 MU Bicester were amalgamated at RAF Abingdon at the endof 1976 and the former Hercules main engineering base at RAF Colernehas closed.    These closures will concentrate RAF aircraft engineeringsupport at three stations: RAF St than, RAF Abingdon and No. 5 MD*Kemble.   At RAF St than, a new repair and overhaul facility for *neAdour engine, fitted to the Jaguar, was commissioned at the end of1976; plans are being prepared for a mechanical component repairfacility to start work there in 1978.   These new undertakings will reduce support costs.71 7.     The transfer of storage tasks, which will lead to the closure of No. 25 MU Hartlebury by August 1977, is proceeding on schedule.The construction of the new facility at No. 16 MU Stafford     is complete.- 106 -CONFIDENTIAL

It is proposed that Medmenham should becomeMinistry of Defence Police Training School; Lindholme and Tern Hill-are each to be used to accommodate an Army unit; the future ofChessington, Hullavington and Bicester has yet to be decided.722.     The availability of these RAF stations, together with the reductions and organisational changes in the Army following theDefence Review, have provided an opportunity to carry out someredeployment of the Army from old inadequate barracks into satis&quot;factory accommodation at a substantially lower cost than would othewise have been possible.    In order to ensure that accommodation arl(*land made surplus by these redeployments  will be disposed of &amp;squickly as possible, improved procedures for continuous monitoringand review have been introduced.INTER-SERVICE CO-ORDINATION OF SUPPORT723.     The next generation of supply automatic data processingis due to come into operation during the period from late 1 978 tothe mid-1980s.    The tri-Service/Procurement Executive project to achieve compatibility between these systems has now largely been successfully completed.   Agreement has been reached on standardterminology to be used at the interfaces between supply and theiysystems of accounts and also between the Services&apos; individual sUpP- 108 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsystems.   As a result all these systems will be able to communicatedirectly with each other.   This will greatly simplify inter-Servicetransactions, facilitate cross-servicing, and simplify logisticmethods in all supply management areas.    Good progress is beingmade with the remaining study of supply in relation to codification.724.     The Directorate of Standardization continues to contribute to defence economies by reducing the variety of items in the defenceinventory and in the preparation of material specifications which arePromulgated in Defence Standards.    The Ministry of Defence is represented on the Executive Board of the British standards institution, and British Standards or International Standards are adopted for defence requirements wherever possible.    The Director ofStandardization is the Defence Metrication Officer and co-ordinates&quot;the changeover to metric units and terminology in the materiel field.72 5.     The NATO codification system, adopted by the Services in1%6, continues to prevent the introduction of duplicate items intothe defence inventory.    The system also provides for the speedy andaccurate exchange of data in support of collaborative equipmentProjects, overseas sales of British equipment, and defence purchasesQf foreign equipment.LANDSReductions in Land and Property Holdings726.     The Ministry of Defence is determined to dispose of all land^d buildings for which no defence requirement is foreseen.    Thedepartment is complying fully with the Government&apos;s policy on landholding for defence purposes which was set out in its Statement on- 109 -CONFIDENTIAL
confidential the Report of the Defence Lands Committee 1971/73 (Cmnd 5714).   about three-quarters of the 22,500 acres which are due for release havealready been passed to the PSA for disposal.    In total the land held as leasehold and freehold by the Ministry of Defence has reduced byabout 30,000 acres over the past four years.727.     Since March 1974 the closure of 36 establishments of varioussizes has been announced, releasing substantial areas of land and buildings.    Some of these are to be used for other defence purposes,which will permit disposal of assets elsewhere.    Others have or willbe passed direct to the PSA for disposal.   Properties being processedfor disposal include: Stainton and Streatlam Camps at Barnard Castle;Grange Camp and Kempston Barracks at Bedford; Heathfield Camp,Honiton; Highland House, Perth; Bushfield Camp, Winchester; andNorton Barracks, Worcester.   Subject to the outcome of consultations with the other interests involved, disposals forecast for 1977 include^part of the site of 3 Field Workshops, Weyhill; the site of theCentral Vehicle Depot, Marchington; the Ministry of Defence PoliceTraining Centre,   Nutfield; the Regimental Pay Office, Nottingham;part of Millbank Military Hospital; and those sites still occupiedby the RAF at Hartlebury.LIVING ACCOMMODATION728.

The Department is working closely withthe PSA on its programme of energy saving measures and is undertaking a number of studies into the efficient use of fuel in defenceestablishments.MOVEMENTS737.     Essential personnel movements tasks in 1976/77 have been^ertaken by the RAF transport force, supplemented by charter con-tracts to north-west Europe and Gibraltar.    The reductions in thetransport force, as a result of the Defence Review, were completed in September 1976, with the withdrawal of the Belfast force.738.Despite these reductions, essential movement of passengers and5igh1a revised system of priority for the use of the transport force.ffeight by air continues to be carried out effectively.    This isag achieved by closer control and management of airlift resources,UnderTheas throutes for RAF scheduled services to the Far East have been changede result of the closure of the RAF staging post at Gan.739      oService sea transport resources have continued to play an^Portant part both in implementing the Defence Review decision to^-th&amp;raw from overseas theatres and in meeting other freighting,^ise and maintenance tasks.    The cost-effectiveness of the RFAsoerned (overseas store carriers and landing ships, logistic) hasbsgv,established and studies are in progress to ensure that theseps continue to be utilised to the best advantage.- 113 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL740.     A military container distribution system has been established between Marchwood military port in the United Kingdom and continentalEurope.    This system, which incorporates aggregation of loads and improved handling techniques, is expected to show worthwhile econoffiieSas it develops.METEOROLOGY741.     Services provided by the Meteorological Office have continued at a high level in recent years, the main customers being the RoyalAir Force, the Civil Aviation Authority and the general public.There has been increased involvement in services for shipping, &quot;the oil industry, the water industry and agriculture.74 2.     The completion of a further stage of automation of the meteological telecommunications system has enabled the establishment offaster data links with neighbouring countries and the automatictransfer of data between the communications and data processingcomputers.    This has helped to improve the services mentioned above which rely to a great extent on the timely receipt, processing anddissemination of the meteorological data.743.     An important aspect of Meteorological Office activities isresearch which is designed to support all the services provided hythe Office.       Three     projects (out of a total of about 70) onwhich particular progress has been made are the use of radar forQuantitative measurement of rainfall,     the study of the factorscontrolling the evolution of drops of water in a fog     and the dement of numerical models of some of the smaller scale processes 111the atmosphere.- 114 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL744.     There were many calls for advice on the 1976 drought.    these were met to the extent that present knowledge allows, but the exceptional conditions emphasised the need for better understandingQf the processes controlling weather and climate, which can comeQnly from further research.COST AND MANPOWER745.     The costs of support functions and the Service and civilianmanpower strengths engaged in them are shown at Annex B.- 115 -CONFIDENTIAL
