&apos;   ;      -    .. .    236&apos;(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP&apos;HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO.C.p:(U7) 33U13TH DECEMBER,   19U7.CABINET31PRIORITY POR BUILDING LABOURMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in his memorandum CP. (47) 329 the Minister&apos; ofHealth asks the Cabinet to defer for at least six months the decision of the Production Committee (P.C.(h-7) hthMeeting, Minute 3) to. grant W.B.A.   priority, for buildingla.bour in future to a very limited amount only of work ofthe first importance. i2. The Minister of- Works,  in his paper to theProduction Committee (P.C.(U7) 18)  proposed that, for thefuture,  the automatic grant of priority to all work adding to the number of dwellings and the semi-automatic priority for work in the development areas should be withdrawn andthat priority should be limited to a very small number ofbuilding projects of national urgency over the whole building-field,        v &apos; ,     5The arguments adduced by the Minister of works were in substance(a) Any scheme which applied to 70% of the field was far too wide in its cover,  self-defeating in itsobjects,  end to add to it would make priority ..   meaningless.(b) To compete with this situation the Ministry of 1&apos; Labour had found it necessary to resort to special administrative measures in order toman up building jobs falling within the PrimeMinister&apos;s priority list,  including, for example,new generating stations.The arguments against the change were:-(a) The need to complete houses under construction.as quickly as possible.(b) The inconsistency which would arise if existinghousing contracts continued to enjoy W.B.A.priority while.new contracts did not automatically.   do so.- -The Production Committee agreed with the proposal of the Minister of Ylforks. -:
23?3. In CP. (1+7) 329, the Minister of Health refers tothe increased size of post-war permanent houses as compared to pre-war permanent houses and argues that if houses are to&quot;be completed in a shorter time it, will be necessary toincrease the number of men employed on housing.In my view the Cabinet intended (CM. (1+7) 81stConclusions,&apos; Minute I+), following, the-Report of the investment programmes Committee (CP. (1+7)  28L+), that the labour employedon &quot;housing should be reduced, not by reducing the number ofhouses finished, but by reducing the number started and by bringing the number under construction down to a levelreasonably compatible with a programme of about 11+0,000 housesstarted and finished annually.1+2 The Minister of Health suggests that builders/becoming unemployed will report to Labour Exchanges in increasing numbers and will be directed to non-buildingoccupations.      It was intended, &apos; however,  that there should be such a transfer- of labour from building to other activities.There would be no point in reducing capital investment either in housing .or in other building unless the labour and materialthus made free were employed elsewhere,  e. g. , in export -orimport saving fields.5* The logical outcome of the argument put forward bythe Minister- of Health,  that it is inconsistent to create a situation in which existing housing&quot;projects enjoy automaticpriority while some future housing projects will have no suchpriority, is that no change could be mode unless and until we cease house building, altogether.        j6, The -Minister of Health offers to agree to the exclusion of private enterprise housing from the automaticpriority field-      I do not think that this is a solution tothe problem because by far the greater part of all housebuilding activity is concentrated in local authority schemes.-7* All experience shows that large automatic blockpriorities tend to squeeze out all other competitors and to defeat their own ends by creating so large s proportion of thefield a priority area as to nullify the very objects of givingpriority at all.      In the case.-, of steel the Cabinet has approved the substitution of a very limited selective priority for the automatic&quot;bulk priorities which, operated during thepast eight or nine months and I consider that the proposals put forward-by the Minister of Works,  accepted by the ProductiCommittee,  and now objected.to by the Minister of Health,  are consistent with this&apos; change and should therefore be endorsed.R.
