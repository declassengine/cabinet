THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1947SECEET Copy No.CP. (47) 3027th November, 1947CABINETCO-OPERATIVE   REPRESENTATION   ON   GOVERNMENTCOMMITTEES AND OTHER BODIESNote by the Prime minister as my colleagues are aware, it is the established practice, in appropriate cases, to consider Trade Union and working-class representation on committeesand other bodies appointed by the Government. The procedure which shouldbe followed in regard to such appointments was set out in my note of 30th January,1947 (CP. (47) 46). It has recently been suggested to me, however, that thedesirability of arranging for representation of the Co-operative Movement onsuch bodies in suitable cases is apt to be overlooked.I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will bear this possibility in mind incases where the appointment, either of an official representative of the Co-opera-tive Movement, or of. a member of the Co-operative Movement chosen in his personal capacity, might be appropriate.C. R. A.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,7th November, 1947.
