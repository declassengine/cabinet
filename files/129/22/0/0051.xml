CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 31CP. (47) 34129th December, 1947CABINETTHE  LANE  PICTURESMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the Cabinet (CM. (47) 80th Conclusions, Minute 2) have approved theinclusion of a Tate Gallery Bill in this Session&apos;s Legislative -Programme. -Themain object of the Bill is to make the Tate Gallery an independent institutionunder.its own Board of Trustees instead of a dependency of the National Gallery,but it will also make some minor changes in the law applicable to the national gallery and the Tate Gallery, e.g., it will remove certain restrictions on the powersof these Galleries to lend their pictures.2. It seems clear that, the introduction of the Tate Gallery Bill will stirUp controversy with Eire about the Lane pictures, and the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations accordingly circulated to the Lord President&apos;s Com-mittee a memorandum (L.P. (47) 169) putting forward a proposal designed to obviate this. His proposal, which was made after informal consultation withthe Chairman of the Tate Gallery Trustees and the Directors of the Nationalarid Tate Galleries, was that negotiations should foe undertaken with the eire government with a view to trying to reach a final settlement, of the claim of&quot;Dublin Corporation to the pictures on the basis of a compromise under which some33 of the 39 pictures would be lent or given to Dublin Corporation, the half-dozenmost valuable pictures being retained in the United Kingdom national collectionin London. The Secretary of State saw some difficulty in embarking on these negotiations when a general election was impending in Eire, and accordingly proposed that the introduction of the Tate Gallery Bill should be postponed for.some months.3. A note of the main developments in the history of the Lane pictures isin Annex A-  Briefly the position is-(i) under a will (Annex C) signed on 11th October, 1913, Sir Hugh Lanebequeathed 39 pictures (listed in Annex B) to the National Galleryiri: London;(ii) by an unwitnessed codicil, dated 3rd February, 1915 (Annex D), SirHugh Lane revoked this bequest and directed that the pictures should go to the City of Dublin, if Dublin Corporation provided a suitablebuilding for them within five years of his death. Failing this, thepictures were to be sold and the proceeds of the sale given to theNational Gallery of Ireland;(iii) despite the claims to the pictures made by the Corporation of Dublinand the Eire Government at various times over the past thirty years,the pictures have been retained in London., 4. When the Lord Presidents Committee considered the memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations the view taken by most ofthe members was that it would be vain, and indeed damaging to our relationswith Eire, to approach the Eire Government unless we were prepared to offer to transfer unconditionally to Dublin Corporation the ownership of all 39 pictures.34700bPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1947 261
It was also felt that if we could, as an act of grace and in an ungrudgingmanner, offer the pictures to Dublin Corporation, our action might well havea favourable effect on the attitude of Eire to the United Kingdom. Accordingly themajority of the Xbrd President&apos;s Committee, while recognising that the loss ofthe more valuable of the Lane pictures from the United Kingdom national collec-tion would be a matter for regret, were disposed to recommend that the Govern-ment should offer to transfer all 39 pictures to Dublin Corporation. On the otherhand, some Ministers, including the Lord Chancellor, while agreeing that it wouldbe inexpedient to enter into negotiations with the Eire Government on the basisof offering only the 33 least valuable pictures, thought that a few of the picturesrepresented such a valuable element in the United Kingdom national collectionthat, rather than part with all 39, *he Government ought to postpone the intro-duction of the Tate Gallery Bill. It was also suggested that it might be worthtrying to reach a compromise settlement with the Eire Government under whichat any given time half of the pictures would be on loan to Dublin.5.   The main considerations bearing on the question are : (a) though the claims of Dublin Corporation have been pressed less insis-tently during the past 15 years, Mr. de Valera raised the subject withthe United Kingdom Representative in Dublin in February, 1947, andthe Eire High Commissioner made representations to Lord Addisonin the summer of 1947. There is thus no hope of avoiding controversyabout the Lane pictures if a Tate Gallery Bill is introduced;(b) the Lord Chancellor, who is a Trustee of both the National Galleryand the Tate Gallery, is satisfied that his fellow Trustees would not agree to part with the half dozen most valuable Lane pictures andthat, should the Government decide to offer all the 39 pictures to dublin Corporation, this decision would have to be imposed on the trustees;(c) the transfer of the Lane pictures to Dublin would mean that much fewerpeople would have access to them;(d) a committee of enquiry appointed&apos;in 1924 by the then Secretary of Statefor the Colonies reported by a majority of two to one that in signingthe codicil of 3rd February, 1915, Sir Hugh Lane thought he was making a legal disposition. Oh the other hand, this committee statedthat even during the short period between the signature of the codiciland Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s departure for America he had indicated thathe was not irrevocably committed to giving the pictures to DublinCorporation; and they were unanimous that it would not be properto modify Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s will by Act of Parliament, since todo so would, in their view, have the effect of bringing about a resultcontrary to the real spirit of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s intentions;(e) in 1926 Mr. Cosgrave, the President of the Executive Council of theIrish Free State, decisively rejected an offer made by the thenSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs with the authority of theCabinet to lend a substantial number of the pictures to Dublin fromtime to time for a substantial period; .      &quot;(/) though the Tate Gallery Bill is not of pressing urgency it would be unfortunate if the changes in the law which it would make were tobe delayed indefinitely;(g) the Lord Chancellor thinks it essential that the Trustees of theNational Gallery and the Tate Gallery should be given an opportunityof&apos; expressing their views before any final decision to offer the( pictures to Dublin Corporation is taken.6. If we are to proceed with the Tate Gallery Bill the possible courses ofaction open to us are : (a) to offer to transfer all 39 pictures to Dublin Corporation unconditionally;(b) to seek to reach a settlement by negotiation with the Eire Governmenteither (i) on the basis of transferring the 33 least valuable pictures to dublin Corporation or (ii) on the basis of lending the pictures to DublinCorporation so that at any given time half of the pictures would be onview in Dublin;(c) not to seek to negotiate with the Eire Government and, if we arechallenged on the Bill, to adhere to the line taken in 1926. (See thestatement in paragraph 12 of Annex A.) &apos;:
If the Cabinet approve (a) or either of the alternatives in (b) it will be necessaryin the first instance to have formal consultations with the Trustees of the national gallery and the Tate Gallery and a decision will be required on how these consultations are to be undertaken.7. An alternative course would be to postpone to a -later Session the intro-duction of the Tate Gallery Bill, but, unless it can be shown that with the lapse oftime the likelihood of controversy over the Lane pictures will grow substantially less, I can see no advantage in postponement.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S. W. 1,29th December, 1947.ANNEX A.Main Developments in the Lane Pictures Controversy1. In the early years of the century Sir Hugh Lane sought to promote theestablishment in Dublin of a Gallery of Modern Art. For this purpose hecollected about 40 Continental pictures and in December, 1907, he depositedthese in temporary premises belonging to, Dublin Corporation in HarcourtStreet. While in the Harcourt Street Gallery, the pictures were labelled &quot; LaneConditional Gift,&quot; Sir Hugh Lane having indicated that they were to become the absolute property of the Corporation provided that a permanent building waserected for them on a suitable site within a few years.2. In January, 1913, Dublin Corporation voted  22,000 for the provisionof a new gallery, but acute controversy arose over the choice of a site. Sir hugh lane himself favoured the erection of a. gallery on the site of the Metal Bridge overthe Liffey and Sir. E. Lutyens produced a design showing &quot; a handsome structureconsisting of two wings parallel with, and abutting upon, the river banks at each side, and joined by an open colonnade forming a foot-bridge.&quot; Not unnaturallythis structure was criticised as &quot; neither a bridge nor a gallery, fantastic, bizarre,and unpractical, a Castle in Spain, whose white stone silhouette would be out oftone and harmony with the rather drab surroundings on the river side &quot;; and theCorporation, after many debates about the Metal Bridge and other alternativesites, finally decided in September, 1913, that the selection of a site must be left tothem.3. Meanwhile, in July, .1913, Sir Hugh Lane, disappointed and irritated bythe opposition to his bridge gallery project, had offered a temporary loan of thepictures to the National Gallery in London, on the ground that Dublin Corpora-Mon were reluctant to carry out his conditions as to building a permanent galleryto house them; and in August 1913 this offer had been accepted.4. On 3rd October, 1913, Sir Hugh Lane executed a will, bequeathing the39 pictures which he had lent to the London National Gallery to that Gallery &quot; tofound a collection of Modern Continental Art in London.&apos;&apos; The relevant portionof the will is in Annex C.5. On 3rd February, 1915, when Sir Hugh Lane3vas about to depart for theUnited States he drew up and signed a codicil to his will (see Annex D.)bequeathing the 39 pictures to the City of Dublin, if Dublin Corporationprovided a suitable building for them within five years of his death. Failing this,the pictures were to be sold and the proceeds of the sale given to the national gallery of Ireland.  The signature to this codicil was not, however, witnessed.8. On 8th April, 1915, Sir Hugh Lane sailed for the United States and on 7th May, 1915, when he was returning in the &quot; Lusitania,&quot; he was drowned.; ,7. From 1915 onwards/repeated claims were made for the return of thepictures to Ireland and in &quot;1919 the matter was considered by the Cabinet whodecided that it was undesirable to take any steps by Act of Parliament to departfrom the intention expressed.in the will of Sir Hugh Lane to leave the pictures,to the National Gallery in London. ... . -34700 s 2
8. The claims of Dublin Corporation continued to be pressed and inJanuary, 1923, the then Secretary of State for the Colonies (the Duke of devonshire) proposed to the Cabinet that an independent Commission should beappointed to hear evidence and report on the equity of the case. This proposal was not considered by the Cabinet because of the troubles in Ireland in 1923, but itwas revived by the Duke of Devonshire&apos;s successor (Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P.) inJuly, 1924, and the Cabinet agreed that a Committee consisting of thefollowing:  Mr. J. W. Wilson (Chairman), late M.P. for North Worcestershire,Mr. George Barnes, late M.P. for Glasgow,Mr. J. W. Hills, late M.P for Durham,should be appointed to consider the arguments advanced by the Irish Free Stateand the Trustees of the National Gallery in London and to report whether intheir opinion -   (i) Sir Hugh Lane, when he signed the codicil of 3rd February, 1915,thought that he was making a legal disposition; and(ii) if so, whether it was proper that, in view of the international characterof the matter at issue, the legal defect in the codicil should be remediedby legislation.9. The report of the Committee, which was submitted in January, 1925,found-(i) that Sir Hugh Lane, in signing the codicil of 3rd February, 1915,thought that he was making a legal disposition (one member of theCommittee felt unable to associate himself with this finding);(ii) that, nevertheless, it would not be proper to modify Sir Hugh Lane&apos;swill by public Act of Parliament. To do so would, in addition toconstituting a legal precedent of the utmost gravity not justified bythe facts, have the effect of bringing about a result contrary to the realspirit of Sir Hugh Lane&apos;s intentions, since his consistent aim hadbeen the establishment of a Gallery of Modern Continental Painting,whether in London or Dublin, and in fact his ideal was being realised in London through the extension of the Tate Gallery, whereas nothinghad been done in&apos;Dublin.The Committee accordingly recommended that legislation to remedy the legaldefect in the codicil should not be introduced. The report also suggested thatan amicable settlement might be reached on the basis of a loan of some of thepictures to Dublin and that legislation might be passed to enable the Trusteesto lend the pictures.10. By direction of the Cabinet the Committee&apos;s report was shown in confidence to Mr. Cosgrave, the President of the Executive Council of the IrishFree State, and to the Trustees of the National Gallery. The attitude of the trustees was that they, did not think it advisable at that stage to apply for legislation to enable them to lend the pictures but that the principle of loan to dublin, which they had favourably considered from the first, would not be affected.On the other hand, Mr. Cosgrave ignored the suggestion of a loan and devotedhimself to attacking the second finding of the Committee.11. The Cabinet, after again considering the matter in April, 1926, on thebasis of a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(Mr. Amery), which asked for authority to discuss with the Trustees of theNational Gallery the possibility of a permanent loan of the pictures to DublinCorporation, agreed to refer it to a Cabinet Committee.12. The report of the Cabinet Committee recommended that the WilsonCommittee&apos;s report should be published and that it should be stated that theGovernment accepted the conclusion that it would be improper to modify Sir hugh lane&apos;s will by legislation. Prior notice of the intention to publish the report should, however, be given to Mr. Cosgrave and he should be told that it wasthe present intention of the National Gallery Trustees, on the expiration of15 years from the date when the Lane pictures came into their possession, to lendto Dublin a substantial number of the pictures from time to time and for asubstantial period. Mr. Cosgrave should also be informed that the Governmentwould be prepared to introduce legislation to enable the pictures to be lent to dublin forthwith.   These recommendations were approved by the Cabinet in
June, 1926, and a communication was duly sent to Mr. Cosgrave. Mr. Cosgrave,however, remained obdurate and on 5th July, 1926, the Prime Minister madethe following statement in reply to a Parliamentary Question:-&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have given very careful consideration overa prolonged period to the whole matter dealt with in this Report (i.e., in theWilson Committee&apos;s Report) and they have decided that they must accept theconclusion reached by the Committee that it would be improper to modifySir Hugh Lane&apos;s Will by legislation. They have, however, received an assurance from the Trustees of the National Gallery that it is their present intention to lend to Dublin a substantial number of the pictures in question from time to time and for a substantial period, as soon as they are empoweredto do so under Section 4 of the National Gallery (Loan) Act, 1883, that is tosay at the expiration of 15 years from the date when the pictures came into their possession, whether a special gallery has then been provided in Dublinor not.&quot;13. In 1932, when Dublin Corporation had provided a new Gallery forModern Art, they published a full statement of their claim to the pictures drawnup by the Curator of the Gallery. In response to this claim the United KingdomGovernment stated that they adhered to the decision announced in 1828 not tointroduce legislation to validate the codicil, and referred Dublin Corporation tothe offer of the National Gallery Trustees to lend some of the pictures for sub-stantial periods. The Corporation refused the offer of a loan of part of thecollection, but said that they would be prepared to accept a loan of the whole foran indefinite period, pending legislation to validate the codicil.14. In May 1938, the London Mercury published ah article by Mr. D. S.MacColl, formerly one of the chief opponents to the transfer, suggesting that, aspart of a settlement of outstanding questions, the Trustees might now offer to hand over the pictures to Dublin Corporation, subject to the conclusion of somesatisfactory arrangement for the mutual loan of pictures. This article was followed by a series of letters in The Times. In particular Sir Robert Witt (thenone of the National Gallery Trustees) put forward the suggestion of alternateholding of the collection and proposed that, as London had now held the picturesfor 20 years, Dublin should have them for a substantial period. Other corre-spondents, e.g., Sir William Rothenstein, pressed for their unconditional returnto Dublin. The matter was also mentioned in the House of Lords in the debates on the Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Bill on 10th and 11th May, 1938, whenLord Strabolgi and Lord Marley urged that action should be taken to give effectto the codicil. Lord De La Warr, replying for the Government, said that theywere aware of the importance of the question and the importance which mr, de Valera attached to it, but that he could not say more than that he could bring the suggestion to the notice of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.In the Dail on 11th May, 1938, Mr. de Valera in reply to a question said, &quot; everyreasonable effort will be made to secure the return of the Lane pictures.&quot;15. In February 1947, Mr. de Valera raised the subject with the UnitedKingdom Representative in Dublin, and in the summer of 1947 the Eire HighCommissioner made representations to Lord Addison.&apos; - : ANNEX-BList of the 39 Lane Bequest PicturesBarye (Antoine), 1796-1875. &quot; Forest of Fontainebleau.&quot;Bonvin (Francois), 1817-1887; &quot; Still Life &quot;Boudin (Eugene-Louis), 1824-1898. &quot;The Beach, Tourgeville.&apos;&apos;Brown (John Lewis), 1829-1890. &quot;The Mountebank.&quot;Corot (Jean Baptiste Camille), 1796-1875. &apos;&apos; The Palace of the Popes, Avignon,&quot;&quot; Summer Morning.&quot;&quot;Peasant Woman.&quot;Courbet (Gustave), 1819-1877. &quot; Self-Portrait.&quot;&quot;In the Forest.&quot;The Snow Storm.&apos;&apos;&quot;The Pool.&quot;Daubigny (Charles), 1817-1878. &quot;Honore Daumier.&quot;Dmjmier (Honore), 1808-1879. &quot; Don Quixote and Sancho Panza &quot;
