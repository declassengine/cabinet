DOLLAR PROGRAMME IN 1948

Memorandum by the Minister of Food

I set out below the main consequences of making the further cut of £75 millions in our purchases of food from dollar sources during 1948, as proposed in C.P. (47)283. I attach a note showing the effects of the consequential breaking of longterm contracts with our dollar suppliers.

FURTHER RATION CUTS NOW PROPOSED

The following reductions in rations would have to be made immediately: 2d off meat; 2 ozs. off sugar; a cut in cheese from 2 ozs. to 1 oz. instead of, as usual, an increase to 3 ozs. during the winter; loss tinned meat on points, and loss shell eggs to make up for the disappearance of dried eggs.

RECENT OR IMPENDING RATION CUTS

These cuts would be super-imposed upon the following ration cuts which we have recently made, or which must in any case be made in the immediate fiture, viz:-

two successive cuts, each of 2d. in the meat ration; a cut (we hope temporary) in the bacon ration from 2 oz. to 1 oz. duc to the Canadian strike; a cut 1/8 in the monthly allowance of points distributed involving a cut of from 15,000 to 3,000 tons in the amount of tinned meat distributed per month, and a corresponding cut in the distribution of tinned fish, the two principal protein foods on points; an inability to meet the present two pint non-priority allowance in milk; a cut of one-seventh in the priority allowances of milk; a cut of nearly half - from 5 lbs. to 21/2 lbs., or at best 3 lbs. per head per week - on the domestic consumption of potatoes. Finally the latest estimates of the home crop of barley and oats are very disappointing. I fear that it will be impossible to maintain a supply of barley for the brewers on a scale adequate to maintain the present beer output. Owing to the reduced oatcrop the amount available for oatmeal and other prepared oat breakfast cereals will be substantially reduced.

NUTRITIONAL CONSEQUENCES

All the above cuts, taken together, would reduce the average daily caloric intake of the population to between 2650 and 2725 calories per day in the first half of 1948. This is a much lower level than that reached at the worst point in the war before Lend/Lease. The lowest annual level reached


during the war was above &quot;the &quot;clanger&quot; level of 2800, and atthe end of the war it was over 3000*     Moroovor throughout thewar both bread and potatoes wore not rationed, and wore freolyavailable to prevent any real hunger.It is tho considered opinion of my scientific advisorsthat the level of nutrition which the cuts proposed inC.P.(J47)283 would involve, would produce &quot;dafinite signs ofundor-nourishment and even of hunger&quot;.     It must be romombcrodthat an average caloric level of 2600/2725 would mean that many poople - workirag class housewives without accoss to&quot;meals out&quot; for example - received little more than about2100 calories per head per day,    since substantially more&apos;than the average level must be provided for heavy workers,adolescents, etc.   At this level of caloric intake people would not only be undor-nourishad, but would feel real hunger.Nor-can&apos;I agree with the assumption in CP. (1*7)283*paragraph 33* that the caloric level would rocovor to 2850/2925in the second half of 19J48,     It would only do sb if all ourmaximum hopes as to increases in nondollar sources pfToodsupplyo/wcro realised.     Experience shows that such hopes can never all be realised;     There are always some disappointmentswhich lower the level realised;    for instance the presentgravo failure of the potato crop is an example of a factor which has substantially falsified the calculations which wowore making last summer on nutritional levels for this wintor,CONSEQUENCES TO THE RATIONING system in my opinion and in the opinion of my advisers thosecuts, coming one on top of the other, would not be confined to inflicting hunger and under-nourishmont on the population.They would also gravely under-mine our whole rationing system.That system is being subjected to ever increasing strain aswo pile more and more tasks upon it, for example, as potatorationing, or allocation - has to be piled upon bread rationing.If people arc now to have the acute incentive of definitehunger to break through tho system, I do not believe thatenforcement, and consequently equitable distribution of ouravailable food, will be possible.     I need not remind mycolleagues of the incalculable consequonccs in nationaldemoralisation,, in waste of national effort, and in socialbitterness and disruption which the progressive breakdown of our rationing&apos;system must quickly produce.INDUSTRIAL,CONSEQUENCESThe effect upon industrial relations of tho appoaranco ofhunger and under-nourishmcnttogether with a progressive andinevitable degeneration of the rationing system, involving aless and less equitable distribution of food, can be imagined.It is for the Ministry of Labour to assess its consequences interms of production.POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCESI cannot doubt that the proposed reduction of tho food supply to a point at which &quot;definite signs of under-nourishnicnt and oven of hunger&quot;appear would, &quot;decisively sotour foot upon that fatal &quot;descending spiral&quot; of lessenedphysical effort and lowered morale;    lessoned output;    reduced-2
incentives;    falling exports, and so in turn a still further reduced ability to buy imports, to which the Minister ofEconomic Affairs has publicly referred.     I agree fully thatit is indispensable to maintain those imports of raw materials which enable us to increase our exports - but it is not equallyindispensable to maintain every ton of those imports of rawmaterials which enable production for the home market to bemaintained.     Sufficient food to enable the population, bothphysiologically and psychologically, to work should be given priority over this second category of raw material Imports.     Woarc now being asked to attempt to combine a great productiondrive with food cuts which, admittedly must reduce the food supply of the population to a point whore undor-nourishmontand hunger appear.      To do this is to   attempt the impossibleand. must end in catastrophe.     It is therefore a completefallacy to suppose that to make, these cuts in food imports isthe policy of prudence.   On the contrary, to do so would, I am convinced, diminish instead of increase our chances of economicsurvival.ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS,I recognise that to-day any Minister who rocommendsthe rojection of cuts, must bo prepared to suggest alternatives.To do so inevitably involves making proposals which affect thoDepartments of one or other of his colleagues - but this cannotbe avoided if ho is to make any concrete suggestions.      It isunquestionably highly desirable to close the dollar gap of 1+58 millions estimated for 19^8 to the extent of tho  175 millionsproposed in CP. (ij.7)283.    If the proposal to cut food imports by  75 millions is rejected, I suggest the following as possible alternatives.i Alternatiye cuts in timports^___:t;obaccoVVfilms-&apos; and, raw wat-or-lals.It is a remarkable feature of CP. (.Lj.?)283 that cuts in food imports which must produce hunger and under-nouriohmont are proposed while tobacco imports of  28 million and &apos;film importsof  8 millions are retained.     How could wo defend the retentionof such imports while we cut food below- the hunger level?      i suggest, therefore, that American tobacco and film imports shouldbe dispensed with during 1948.     Consumption of tobacco shouldbo reduced the point at which it can be met for tho yoar out ofexisting stocks.     Any showing.of American films which involve further dollar payments to the U.S.  should bo stopped altogether.These measures may involve the breaking of contracts, but sodo the proposed cuts in food imports.      This would give us a saving of  36 million towards the required  75 million.If these cuts in imports arc thought insufficient, the rawmaterial Import programme should be further examined by ministers.     For while it is clearly impossible to cut rawmaterials which will go to the fabrication of exports, thoseraw material imports which go to the fabrication of articlesfor the home market should certainly be cut before essentialfood imports aro cut.Diversion of exportsI further suggest that tho President of tho Board of Tradebe invited to submit proposals for finding the remaining  39 million to take tho placo of  75 millions cut in proposed food imports bytho diversion of additional exports from ^eaAa-r to-non-dollar Co civiledestinations.      CP, (1+7)283 estimates that there will be an
export surplus of over £300 to non-dollar destinations in 1948. This in effect means that we shall be exporting over £300 million of foods during 1948, for which we shall get nothing in return. How can we defend continuing to do that when we are cutting our essential food imports. I am not ready to believe that emergency methods cannot be found by which £39 million&apos;s worth (little more, than 10% of the surplus to non-dollar areas) of these exports cannot be sold to dollar destinations. Such emergency measures would no doubt be difficult to devise and apply in time and would be unpalatable to industry. But how can we fail to cut through all difficulties in applying them when the alternative is the infliction of hunger and malnutrition on our own people, and the grave risk of a breakdown of our rationing system with its catastrophic consequences?

Increase in export targets

If such a diversion of exports proves insufficient, I suggest that it can be supplemented and re-inforced by the raising of export targets, if necessary by the further curtailment of supplies in the home market. How can we defend giving our people very considerable quantities inessential manufactured commodities while denying them essential food, until and unless we have at least attempted to exchange these manufactured commodities for official food? Has a determined attempt to do yet been made? This argument applies even to commodities extremely important to the home market. It would be surely far better to do without more than a minimal clothing ration even for one year, rather than to go hungry? And I understand that there is little doubt of our ability to sell for dollars the additional textiles which a minimal clothing ration would free, and to do so immediately.

Priority in sacrifices

These particular suggestions for effecting the desired degree of the closing of the dollar deficit without cutting food imports further, may or may not be the correct ones. But I cannot escape the conclusion that the order of priority sacrifices envisaged in C.P. (47)283 is fundamentally wrong. Long before food imports are cut to below the 2800 calorie level at which hungdr and under-nourishment must appear, and the appalling risk of a progressive breakdown in our whole rationing system be incurred, other inessential imports should be eliminated, and far mere drastic measures be taken to divert to dollar destinations, and/or to increase, exports, if necessary at the expense of the home market.

RECOMMENDATION

I therefore most earnestly recommend to my colleagues that the proposed cut of £75 millions in dollar food imports should not be accepted. Instead measures for eliminating inessential imports combined with diverting, and/or increasing, exports should be prepared as a matter of urgency, as an alternative method for narrowing the dollar gap to the degree proposed in C.P. (47)283.

NOTE PIT THE EFFECTS OF.....BREAKING OUR-LONG-TE,RMmCONTRAOTSFOR D0LLAR&quot;&apos;F00D IMPORTS1.     After giving effect to the  50 million a year cut in imports of food from hard currency countries and thedecision taken at the beginning of August to stop all&apos;buyingof dollar food not covered by the Long Term Contractthedollar food Import Programme from the present date up to theend of December, 1948, amounts to  357 million made upas follows:- MillionWheat.............................. 97Feeding stuffs,................... 62Oils and fats (including linseed)oil.............................. 33Sugar.....* - - *................... 30Mcat*- carcase.................... 44canned,.................... 27Bacon o.......................... 28Cheese           ...........n......,, 9Eggs (shell and dried),....... , 23Minor items,........:........... 4 31,/No further cuts have been proposed in CP, (47)283on wheat feeding stuffs and oils and fats.    The balance ofthe dollar food, except for some small quantities bought,but not yet shipped, is covered fay contracts.     The sugarwo have bought, or contracted to buy, from private shippers.If we began to break any of those sugar-contracts theconsequences  to our commercial reputation are incalculable.2,     The principal moat contract is with the argentine government covoring 70$ ,,-of the total amount of dollar moatdue to arrive up to the end of 1948,     There can&apos;be noquestion of partly breaking this contract;    if the contractwere broken the whole of the meat would be at some risk,though I do not think that the Argentine Government would find it easy to dispose of a large proportion of it olsowhoro.If we wanto5 to take a part of the moat only, however, wcshould obviously havo to negotiate a now contract involvingnow and higher prices.     The present prices,are veryreasonable.
3,     There is some reason to believe that we shall be ableto persuade Argentina to continue sending us tho whole ofJrhis meat and to hold sterling for it until such time as our export Programme can provide her with the imports she needsfrom use      I am reinforced in this view by the fact that Ihave within the past fortnight received from the ArgontinoEmnassy in Lpndon an intimation that the Argentine Governmentis willing to offer to continue exporting fruit to us on credit - -presumably on lines similar to the arrangementsrecently made with South Africa-^h.     The bacon, cheese and eggs all como -from Canadaunder agreements with the Canadian Government.     Tho Canadianhog-roaring and bacon curing industries were greatly dovelopodduring the war to meet our needs.     We receive from Canadanow nearly.throo .times as much as we did before the warand the quality has improved to make it equal to tho bestDanish bacon.     Tho export trade in eggs from Canada is entirely now.      It has been developed under tho expert advice of the.Ministry of Pood.     By careful storagetho Canadians arc able to send us a high proportion of thosupplies in the late autumn and winter, when we need thornmost.5. The trade in cheese v/ith Canada is a very old pre-war trade which was greatly developed during the v/ar hut whichhad fallen back to pre-war figures lately in view of thelarge. increase in Canadian consumption of milk.    Th&quot;oCanadians would no dount have difficulty in disposingpermanently of their surpluses of those three commodities in tho United States.     But it seems to rac quite wrongthat we should give any hint or take any action whichwould imply that they should begin to think of doing so.If we arc not careful, not only shall wo lose -presentsupplies, but we shall lose a most important souccc ofsupply.     Canada is a low-cost country for all three ofthose commodities and one, therefore, from which.in a multilateral economy wo ought to draw our imports..Canada has a deficit with the United States of  500million, and wo have  a, deficit with Canada of  375 million^Is not  our best course of action to seek an agreement *v/ith Canada under which she continues to send us thesefoodstuffs and holds sterling, while we straim every nerveand use every possible device to produce and get intoCanada the manufactured goods,she can no longer afford to buy from the United States.6,     If wo cease unilaterally to take these   commodities from Canada the question of discriminating against Canadaseems to arise at once under the Canadian loan agroomont..Eggs from Eire, bacon and eggs from Denmark, and cheese from holland, under the new agreements wo are seeking to makev/ith those countries, will.all be dearer than these commodities coming from Canada.7,     Thore is an enormous amount of goodwill in Canada-towards this country and the Canadian Government willface serious political difficulties if they do not find some means of continuing supplies to tho United Kingdom,Until wo arc ready to open general negotiations with CanadaI can soe nothing but harm in raising doubt in the minds ofthe Canadian exporters as to whether their market hero willcomtinuc.
