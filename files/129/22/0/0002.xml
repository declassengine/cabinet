(47). 29218TH OCTOBER.  1947CABINET/AMENDMENT OF. THE PARLIAMENT ACT,   1911 -Memorandum bv the Lord President of the council. The Cabinet decided on 14th October that legislation -..to amend the Parliament Act, 1911?  should be introduced inthe coming&quot;Session and invited the Machinery of government committee to consider and report to them on&apos; the form that this legislation should take (CM. (47) 80 th Conclusions, Minute l).2. &apos; The brord alternatives considered by the Cabinet intheir preliminary discussion on 14th October were -(i) That a Bill passed by the Commons in two successiveSessions within a minimum period of one year should become law, notwithstanding the opposition of the Lords.      (Thisis the proposal outlined in paragraphs 6-8 of the LordChancellor &apos; s memorandum (CP. (46) 376)).(ii) That it should be-made possible for the Commons toenforce the passage of a Bill within a single Session,notwithstanding the opposition of the Lords/&quot;3* In considering these alternatives (at a meeting at- which they had. the assistance of the Lord Chancellor)  theMachinery of Government Committee proceeded on the assumptionthat, while the power of the House of Lords, to obstructGovernment legislation should be curtailed, the Lords shouldbe left with sufficient power to enable  them to operate-effectively as a revising Chamber.     It should be.kept in mind that what is in question is, not merely the power of the Houseof Lords to reject a Bill outright, but also their power toensure that amendments which they have made in a Bill passedby them are given due weight by the House of Commons.      the commons are in a position to require the Lords to pay properrespect to their views-      If it is intended that the lords should continue to have effective opportunities of legislativerevision,  there must be some sanction to ensure that the Commonsshall give due consideration to Lords amendments.      Under    theexisting law this sanction is provided by the fact that,.unlessagreement on Lords amendments is reached between the two Houses,the Commons- cannot get the Bill in the Session in which it is introduced.      The procedure also secures that, .in cases of
disagreement,  there is some time for reflection in both Houses;and we think that a certain measure of delay is valuable forthat purpose.4* For these reasons we doubt whether it would be expedient to frame emending legislation in a. form which wouldempower the Commons to enforce its will within a single Session.Legislation on those lines would foil to give- either the- Lordsor the country any assurance that Lords amendments would receivedue consideration by the Commons,-     Further,  there is thepractical point that disagreements between the two Houses are.most likely to occur on major Bills which would not normallyreach the Lords until the Session was well advanced and itwould be difficult, without on inordinate lengthening of the-Session,  to give time for oil the subsequent stages to becompleted without undue haste.&apos; 5-. In all the - circumstances we favour the proposal madeby the Lord-Chancellor in CP. (4-6)376 that Commons Billsopposed by the Lords should pass into law after two successiveSessions provided that a minimum period of one.year has elapsed between the first of the Second Readings in the Houseof Commons and the final passing of the Bill in that House.It is desirable that the Commons should not berequired to take the Bill through all its stages on the secondoccasion.     The opportunities for debate on a Bill coming withinthe Parliament Act can, however,  already be restricted andthese opportunities could be.reduced still further by standing orders so as to ensure that the minimum time is taken up inthe Commons in re-presenting the Bill to the Lords.The Lord Chancellor&apos;s proposal need not involve serious delay in securing legislation, as compared with proposals for overriding the Lords in c single Session,  sincethe second of the two Sessions could be a short Session- specially called for the purpose between two normal Sessions.6. It may be useful if wo indicate how the passage ofa measure on these lines would enable any important government bills to be passed under Its provisions during the present parliament,If the Lords accepted this amendment- of the parliament act,  the Bill, would become- law by July, 1948.     Any legislation which was introduced in the 1948/49 Session and was rejected, inthat Session by the Lords could be passed in the 1949/50 SessionUnder the Parliament Act as so ramended.If, on the other hand,  the Lords opposed this amendmentof the &quot;Parliament Act and&apos; the&apos; Bill had to be carried throughunder the existing provisions of the 1911 Act,  it could be passed into lav? by the latter part of 1949.      This would allow for the two years which must elapse between the first of theSecond Readings in the House- of Commons and the final passingof the Bill in that House,      It would,&apos; however, be necessary tohold a short additional Session within that period in order tocomply with the provisions of&apos; the Act,     If an importantGovernment- Bill were then introduced in ,the 19^8/149 Session itcould, under the new Parliament Act provisions,  be carried into law notwithstanding the opposition-of the House of Lords inthe final Session of the present Parliament,      It would benecessary to.ensure that the new Parliament Act covered bills which were already before Parliament before it passed into law,
but - wo understand that this point ocn easily be covered inthe drof ting of the Bill.7. We.therefore recommend that the amendment of the parliament-should take the form of providing that a (bill passed by.the Commons in two successive Sessions within aminimum period of one year shall become law, notwithstandinthe: opposition of the Lords.H.M. -Privy Council Office,    S.W. 1.,18th October, 1947..
