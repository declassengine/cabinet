Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1947SECRET Copy No.I    CP. (47) 33819th December, 1947CABINETMID-WEEK SPORT AND SUMMER TIME IN 1948Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotlandAT their meeting on 12th December (P.C. (47) 5th Meeting, Minute 1), theProduction Committee considered the annexed memorandum about mid-weeksport in 1948 and agreed that the restrictions imposed on mid-week sport in 1947ought to be maintained next year. In addition, the Committee agreed that no special trains should be run in 1948 in connection with sporting events.2. The Committee were reminded tha,t the Olympic Games are to be held inLondon next year. Although it might be argued that to hold the Games wouldbe inconsistent with a general restriction of mid-week sports, the Committee feltthat the criticism was of no real validity, since the Games are an internationalevent for which arrangements must be made far ahead and which in any casefall to be completed within fifteen days.3. We should also consider the duration of summer time next year. Underthe Summer Time Act, 1947, the commencement and termination of summer timefall to be fixed annually by Order in Council. This year the agricultural interestsobjected to the use of double summer time and, after consideration of their objec-tions, the Prime Minister announced our decision not to introduce double summertime next year. We think that in the interests of production it is probably desir-able that for 1948 the period of siunmertime should be the same as it was this year(approximately 1\ months) and that it should be introduced on 14th March &quot;andend on 31sfc October. This proposal may, however, be strongly-opposed by theagricultural interests and it is proposed that the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland should consult them before any decision is announced. &quot;.

[P.G. (47) 216th December, 1947]ANNEXProduction CommitteeMID-WEEK SPORT IN 1948Memorandum by the Home SecretaryDURING the current year, in the interests of production, steps were takento arrange that sporting events which were likely to attract large attendancesshould, so far as possible, take place only on Saturday afternoons or Saturdayevenings. In only one case greyhound racing was legislation necessary, becausethe days on which greyhound racing with betting facilities may take place are fixed by local licensing authorities and in certain areas the two appointed days,to which racing is limited, did not include Saturdays. To this end the Dog RaceCourse Betting (Temporary Provisions) Act, which expires on 30th June nextunless previously revoked, was passed.As regards both codes of focfcbalL the representative sporting bodies have -operated and have met my request that major events should not as a rulebe decided on days other than Saturdays. The fixtures for the football season1947-48 (which began on 23rd August last and will, unless exceptional circum-stances arise, end on 1st May next) have been so arranged that &apos;(a) extra time will be allowed where, at the end of 90 minutes play, theresult is a draw;(b) replays, where necessary, will take place on a Saturday; &apos;(c) any match which had to be postponed as a result of such replay will bearranged for a vacant Saturday or for a mid-week date during theperiod when summer-time or double summer-time is operative.As. regards horse racing, the Stewards of the Jockey Club and the NationalHunt Club have co-operated by altering the dates of the Grand National, the manchester Cup, the Chester Cup, the Derby and the St. Leger to Saturdays.It was not necessary to make many alterations in the Racing Calendar becausemost meetings had small attendances and by their location did not interfere with production.Speedway facing, which normally takes place on greyhound racing tracksand is a family sport mainly attracting adolescents, was allowed to have mid-weekmeetings, without which the sport would have been killed; the Controlling Bodyreadily undertook to consult me before sanctioning the licensing of any new track.It was not necessary to. propose any limitation on cricket or tennis.I have already been approached by the Epsom Grand Stand Association about their arrangements for racing during 1948. Decisions will shortly be requiredabout the dates of the classic events. If greyhound racing is to continue tobe limited to Saturday meetings, legislation to continue the Act of 1947 willbe required. The greyhound racing interests strongly resent the existing arrange-ments and any extension of the Act will lead to considerable criticism from those interests in and outside Parliament. The Speedway Control Board have askedwhether they may consider licensing a small number of additional tracks nextyear.I should be glad to have the views of my colleagues on the question whetheror not mid-week sport shall be limited in 1948 on the same lines as in 1947. Whendiscussions took place in the House earlier this year the Departments which had urged the Government to interfere with mid-week sport failed to produce any evidence to support this action, and if we seek to continue our policy I shall expectmy colleagues directly concernecl with production to furnish me beforehand withthe material to justify our decision to the sporting interests and to the House.When my colleagues consider the question of mid-week sporting events, Ithink it desirable that they should also consider what should be the duration of summer time next year.

The Prime Minister in his answer to Mr. Anthony Greenwood on 11th june last (Official Report, Col. 123) said: &quot; . . . . In the light of all the informationbefore them, the Government have decided that they can now give an assurance that it is not their intention to make use of the powers contained in Section 1 (2)of the Summer Time Act, 1947, for the purpose of introducing double summer time during the year 1948.&quot;Under the Summer Time Act, 1947, the duration of summer time next yearmay be fixed by Order in Council. This year summer time began on 16th Marchand ended on 2nd November. Next year I would suggest that summer time should begin on 14th March and end on 31st October.J. C.
