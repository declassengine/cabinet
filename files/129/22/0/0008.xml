iiiraiiiiiii(THIS DOCUMENT is&apos;THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET31-st October,  19U7.CABINETCEREALSMemorandum by the Minister of Food &quot;*The attached paper expresses the doubts and misgivingsfelt by my Department at the proposal to de-ration bread.     I trust &apos;that my colleagues will weigh them with the utmost care,since they represent the views of the most expert opinionobtainable in this country.     Ytfe should incur a heavyresponsibility if we acted in direct contradiction to their,advice.2. For my part I cannot, in face of the considerations set out,  recommend the de-rationing of bread until and unless some additional imports of wheat can be obtained.3* On the other hand,  I agree emphatically with theviews expressed in Cabinet (C.M.(l4-7) 82nd Conclusions, --Minute 3),by my colleagues as to the extreme desirability and urgency of de-rationing bread at the earliest possible moment.      nothing could relieve the strain more than to follow closely the rationing or allocation of&quot;potatoes, which is quite Iindispensable on supply grounds, by the de-rationing of-bread.k. I therefore propose that I should be authorised to try to buy an additional Lj.00,000 tons of wheat for deliveryin this country over (say) the next nine months, using,  ifnecessary,  convertible sterling or other dollar equivalentsfor this.purpose.      I suggest that in order not to worsen thebalance of payments a firm decision should simultaneously betaken to refrain from buying United States tobacco during thewhole of 19148,  and to use the dollars so saved for additionalfood imports.     &quot;This would save between  20 million and  30million, while 1+00,000 tons of wheat would cost between  8million and  13 million. -5. There are three possible sources for additionalwheat.(1) &apos; RussiaI propose that as part of the trade negotiations withRussia, which I.understand are about to be resumed, we should .offer to pay for h.00,000 tons of wheat with convertiblesterling.      Such an offer yi/ould,  I understand, make animportant contribution to the possibility, of getting anagreement.      And this in turn should enable us to buy 700,000tons of barley, maize and/or oats, which as my colleagues will see from Part II - of Annex II we now desperately need.      In2 copy NO.  J   u&apos;
fact,  if we do not get some additional barley, oats or maizefrom somewhere it seams only too probable that our wholelivestock programme will come to ruin for lack of feeding-stuffs.-If, on the other hand, a substantial additional quantityof barley and oats can be bought in .Russia or elsewhere,much of the fears of my advisers that substantial quantitiesof wheat and flour will, on de-rationing, be given to hensand pigs, would be removed..     For we should be able to makeanimal feeding-stuffs reasonably, plentiful.      An increase inthe supply of any one cereal relieves the position in regardto the others, -since they are to some extent interchangeable.(2)     The ArgentineIt is estimated that the Argentine exportable surplusof wheat will be 1 million tons less out of the 19L8 crop(harvested in January) than it. was out of the 19I4.7 crop.Still it might be possible to buy up to i+00,000 tons there,though no doubt at an extremely high price.      The argentine government,  on past experience,  is not.likely to be willingto begin negotiations till the end of the year however.This would postpone de-rationing until the end of the new year.Nevertheless,. if we do not obtain the Russian cereals thisoffers the next best chance.(3)      The United States , ,The United States Government could no doubt allot usk00,000 tons of wheat this winter, but only at the expense;of other claimants.      As the memorandum at Annex III shows,Mr. Maurice Hutton, the head of the British Food Mission in washington,  is pessimistic as to the possibility of obtainingwheat from the United States Government, for the purpose of.de-rationing bread.     Nevertheless, and again if other sourcesfail,  the attempt should be made.      In fact the effect uponthe United States Government of de-ratio.ning*is a factor which should be most carefully considered, whether.or not weare at the moment attempting to buy wheat from them.RECOMMENDATIONSMy recommendations are:-(1)    That I should be empowered to attempt to buy up to1-1-00,000 tons of wheat from Russia (as part of the resumed trade negotiations), the Argentine, theUnited States (or elsewhere) offering convertiblesterling,  or other dollar equivalents.(2)    That as soon as the purchase of this additional400,000 tons of wheat for delivery in this country during the next nine months has &quot;been made (andsubject to the Australian purchase having beenfinalised, which should be shortly) bread should -be de-rationed. .J.

ANNEX united KINGDOM-CEREALS  STOCK AND  SUPPLY POSITION11 - v: - 1947-48  :r- 1 -       &apos;i&apos;1 &apos;,:&apos;\V;&apos;&apos;&apos;:      . &apos; Summary :.;v&apos;; !;&apos;   . &apos;Part I. Wheat and Flour1. Introduction of Bread Rationing., si.......At the end of June 1946 bulk stocks of wheat and flour in the UnitedKingdom were 815,000 tons and 272,000 tons, respectively, and to ensure con-discontinuity of distribution bread-flour rationing was introduced on 21st July, 1946.By April 1947 bulk stocks were so reduced as to make it necessary to temporarilyreduce off take by superimposing on the rationing scheme a restriction on the delivery of flour by millers. It had been hoped that rationing would effect a saving of around 6 per cent, and during the early months of the scheme the apparent saving was larger. Average weekly deliveries over the 58 weeks sincebread rationing commenced show a decrease of 8-5 per cent, compared withdeliveries in the 52 weeks prior to rationing. Compared with the same pre-rationing period the percentage decrease for the 26 weeks to 18th October, 1947,was 5 - 9 per cent. off take has progressively increased and in the three weeks to18th October, 1947, weekly deliveries from bulk stocks averaged about 102,200tons. It seems likely that the effect of the shortages of other foods will furtherweaken the rationing scheme and off take may soon reach the pre-rationing levelof 103,000 tons per week.2. Forward Supply PositionSubject to the qualifications referred to in the accompanying memorandum and in the relevant stastistical tables, arrivals at United Kingdom ports duringthe cereal year 1947-48 are estimated at 5,082,000 tons, wheat equivalent, outof estimated shipments of 5,120,000 tons. The import requirements of the UnitedKingdom for the twelve months, as submitted to the International EmergencyFood Council, total 5,886,000 tons, wheat equivalent, but it is unlikely that thequantity of wheat and flour which will be apportioned to the United kingdom by the I.E.F.C. will exceed 4,634,000 tons. Presently estimated shipments, there-fore, exceed the assumed &quot;allocation&quot; by nearly half a million tons although they will fall short of our stated requirements by 766,000 tons. The figure of5,886,000 tons is the target figure estimated as necessary to meet an offtakeof 103,000 tons of flour a week, reduce the extraction rate to 80 per cent, from 1st January, 1948, and end the year with a bulk stock of 907,000 tons of wheat and 412,000 tons of flour, representing 11 weeks&apos; flour consumption requirements-If it should be possible to obtain additional supplies the I.E.F.C. apportionmentwould be further exceeded.3. Flour OfftakeFlour disappearances from bulk stocks have been calculated on three alterna-tive bases, 103,000, 106,000 and 110,000 tons per week. The first representsassumed deliveries under rationing; the second provides some indication of theprobable level of unrationed distribution, but makes no allowance for any sub-stantial reduction in the supply of other foods. The third hypothesis of anofftake of 110,000 tons attempts to evaluate in terms of flour disappearance thequantity of bread which would have to be provided to make good a seriousreduction in the supply of other food-stuffs, including potatoes. An increasein consumption from 103,000 tons to 110,000 tons a week would be equivalent toa rise of 70 - 5 calories per head per day. Should bread and flour be used toany substantial degree for animal feeding if bread rationing were abolished anofftake of 110,000 tons may well be exceeded especially as potatoes and oatmeal,are in short supply. To allow for only one additional small loaf (14 oz.)per head of population per week would represent the disappearance of 13,900!tons of flour a week which, added to would mean a total weekly disappearance of over 114,000 tons. At this rate supplies now in prospect would be insufficient to maintain bulk distribution through the Spring as by end of June total bulkstocks of wheat and flour would be run. down to about three and a half weeks&quot;supply.34428 r
Part 11.^-Coarse Grains.&apos;, - . Summary; 5. The total quantity of coarse grains now in sight from all sources fallssubstantially short of minimum essential requirements. If the expanded livestockprogramme is to be met, a satisfactory stock level built up for starting the1948-49 season, and provision made even for industrial and human consumptionlat the lower levels now being&apos; adopted additional imports of the order of.750,000 tons would be required by the end of September 1948.6. So far as can be foreseen imports of this order will not be obtainable bythat time unless a trade agreement with Russia can be made and it will, there-fore, be impossible to provide for the programmed increase in the feeding-stuffsration as from 1st May; 1948. On the present rationing basis the global deficitis reduced to 176,000 tons and every endeavour is being made to find this quantityin overseas markets. To get supplies of this order may be possible. The positionin regard to oats, barley and maize is : -7. Oats. Against the supply of 595,000 tons in 1946-47 not more than230,000 tons will be available during 1947^-48 for consumption and stock. Inorder to safeguard supplies for the feeding of essential horses, it will benecessary&quot; to reduce supplies to oatmeal millers. This will reduce, the quantityof oatmeal and oat flakes available for human consumption to not much more thanone-eighth of last year&apos;s availability.Conclusions (i) The Ministry of Food should take control of the sale of all home-grownoats, e.g., by directing authorised buyers and oatmeal millers to selloats only to horse feeders or to the Ministry so that the Ministry canprevent further supplies of oats being taken up by millers at theexpense of the essential horses. ,4. Conclusions (Wheat and Flour)Although the statistical position is satisfactory until the Spring it wouldbe highly dangerous to de-ration bread because-     t(a) the supply estimates, may not be achieved for the reasons given in thepaper; &apos; &apos;(&amp;) it is impossible to predict what would be the off take of flour once breadhad been de-rationed owing to the shortages of other foods, particu-larly potatoes and its. possible use for feeding animals (particularlyback-yard pigs and poultry);(c) while supplies now in sight are estimated to be sufficient to meet anofftake of up to 103,000 tons per week no substantially larger offtakewould be possible unless additional imports are obtained.The supply position could be strengthened by-(i) additional imports from new sources, e.g., Russia;(ii) additional supplies from the United States and South America, subjectto availability, and if dollars are provided;(iii) raising the extraction rate; this would mean a darker and moreunpopular loaf and would reduce the supplies of food available foranimals to the extent to which it increased the amount of food availableto human beings.On the other hand, the reduction in supplies of potatoes (which are used to asubstantial extent for feeding animals), coupled with an extreme shortage of oats and oatmeal, would lead to the diversion of bread and flour to animal feedingif bread consumption is decontrolled.In the circumstances it would be dangerous to de-ration bread, even for alimited period, because if the public thought that the reimposition of rationingwas likely this would lead to extensive stocking up of flour-a demand which itwould be impossible to meet.       .     r -
(ii) Tp meet the complaints of farmers owing to the loss of their valuableoatmeal milling market, the price paid by the Ministry for all oats;  should be raised to the milling price. j,(iii) Oatmeal and all oat products for human consumption are being putback on points.8. Barney.-Supplies from the home crop for 1947-48 are estimated at,658,000 tons as compared with 1,963,000 tons last year. Every effort is being-made to obtain maximum imports of barley, but, except for the possibility ofsecuring about 100,000 tons of malting barley from Australia, it is unlikely that more than 180,000 tons (from Argentina) will be available. By reducing end ofseason&apos;s stocks at 30th September, 1948, to only 25,000 tons it is possible to release 123,000 tons for current consumption, which, together with imports, willmake available supplies somewhat larger than the 1946-47, but this is more than offset by the increased requirements for brewing and distilling.Conclusions (i) Supplies to distillers  from the  1947 crop should be limited to150,000 tons, of which they have already been authorised to purchase75,000 tons. In authorising the purchase of the second 75,000 tonsit should be a condition that exports of whisky are maintained at thehighest possible level.(ii) Supplies of barley for brewing should be reduced by 5 per cent.  Thiswould reduce current beer output by 6 per cent.(iii) All supplies available in Australia should be bought notwithstanding the very high price.9. Maize.-During the year 1947-48 the total quantity of: maize now estimated to be available is 923,000 tons. For human and industrial purposes266,600 tons will be required to meet essential needs: -.).    . tons for starch   ...      ............      150,600For glucose ...      ...      ...      ...        66,000For cereal breakfast foods ...      ...        50,000266,600A working stock of 45,000 tons will be needed, leaving a balance of about611,000 tons for animal feeding.Conclusions-(i) Usage for human and industrial consumption should be limited to the reduced quantity of 266,600 tons.(ii) Every effort should continue to be made to secure additional supplies from any source, and to ensure the shipment of quantities contractedfor in Brazil.(iii) Failure to secure supplies programmed plus an additional quantity of around 600,000 tons will involve curtailment or temporary abandon-ment of the long-term plan of livestock rehabilitation.&apos;ANNEX united Kingdom Cereals Stock and Supply PositionDetailed NotesPart I. Wheat and Flour1. Bulk Stocks and SuppliesThis paper reviews briefly the history of supply and distribution since theintroduction of bread rationing in July 1946, and assesses the supply and con-sumption prospects for the year July 1947 to June 1948.34428 c 2
\2. Experience of Bread I Flour Rationing      &quot;   .At the end of June 1946 bulk stocks of wheat and flour in the. UnitedKingdom were :- -    :^ ( &apos;Wheat .........      ...      815,000 tons.Flour ...      ...      :..      ...      272,000 tons.In the light of the forward supply position as then assessed, it was. decidedto ration domestic consumption of bread/flour with effect from 21st July, 1946.Estimates then indicated that bulk stocks of wheat would progressively deterioratefrom the July 1946.level of 592,000 tons to.466,000 tons at the end of April 1947.Flour stocks were expected to be 303,000 tons, increasing to 390,000 tons at endApril 1947, on the basis that flour deliveries would average 97,500 tons a week at an extraction rate of 90 per cent. On 22nd September, 1946, however, it wasdecided to lower the flour extraction rate to 85 per cent, and the end of monthbulk stock levels to September 1947 proved to be : At end of statistical month1946-July..:&apos;... &quot;    ...August ...      ...September ...October ...      ...v November .......December ...1947-January     ...       February    ...      ...March       ...      ...April ...      ...may june ...      ...July ...      ...AugustSeptember  ...The marked improvement from June onwards is primarily due (a) to the exceptionally large arrivals from Canada, following the reopening of navigation,in an effort to implement the first year&apos;s supply under the terms of the UnitedKingdom/Canadian Wheat Contract, (b) to the continuation of lower standardsfor millable wheat from the home crop, (c) to the increased price inducementhaving attracted larger quantities of old crop home-grown wheat off farms, and Id) to the very favourable conditions under which the home crop for 1947 has:been harvested and which has resulted in unusually early and heavy deliveries.It was hoped that the rationing scheme would effect a saving of some 6 per*cent. in total flour disappearances and during the early months of the scheme the apparent saving was, in fact, much larger. The weekly average for the twelvemonths from 21st July, 1946, was 93,800 tons, but for the week ending4th October, 1947, total deliveries amounted to 102,300 tons and the weeklyaverage for the previous 13 weeks was around 98,400 tons. It is impossible tosay what flour &apos;&apos; saving &apos;&apos; has been effected by rationing, but, unfortunately,off take is now more or less continuously increasing and if this tendency ismaintained it may reach pre-rationing level within the next few months.

Forward Supply PositionA statistical appraisement of the forward supply position is given in the tables appended and the basis upon which assumed arrivals have been calculatedis more particularly referred to hereunder. These qualifications should be read,however, in conjunction with, the notes on the relative tables.(a) CanadaWhile it may be assumed that the Canadian Government and the canadian wheat Board will do everything possible to ship the quantities - due under the
745United Kingdom/Canadian Contract in 1947-48, there are factors which may;seriously impede their ability to do so.   Of these the more important are :-(i) Canadian production is less than was originally anticipated and the exportable surplus is now estimated to be of the order of 5 - 4: million tons, as against 6-3 million tons last year.(ii) The Canadian harvest is late and movement consequently delayed.(iii) Canada will be short of feed grains and farmers may feed increasedquantities of wheat to livestock.(iv) Canada will be subject to increasing pressure to make supplies availableto the other deficit countries of the world, and there will be littlemargin over the United Kingdom Contract quantity for disposal.(v) The Canadian Wheat Board are not receiving the number of box carsnecessary to meet the target set by them. In an endeavour to effectan improvement in rail movement the Board and the two CanadianRailway Companies had a meeting on 15th October, but it ispractically certain that the target will not be achieved.(vi) Rail movement is of particular importance as the quantity of wheat which can be moved into shipping positions by the end of Novemberor thereabout will determine the quantity which can be shippedduring the period of closed navigation. If by that date supplies insufficient volume are not moved the loss cannot subsequently be made good during the period to June 1948.(vii) The question of snipping generally, and in particular the provisionof sufficient tonnage to lift supplies from the Pacific coast, is also a material factor. For present purposes it has been assumed that suffi-cient tonnage will be available to lift all supplies in sight.(viii) At the end of July 1947 the Canadian pipe-line was virtually empty,stocks were low and only negligible quantities were in shippingpositions.In the light of these considerations, many of them imponderable at this stage,it seems possible that the Canadians will experience great difficulty in makingthe contract quantity available and supplies at the end of June may fall shortby a substantial amount. Estimated arrivals in Table II assume that 330,000tons of the contract quantity will remain for shipment after the end of the contractyear.(b) australia the actual quantity which mav be available for export is not yet known, butit&apos; had been hoped that 2,300,000 tons (85,000,000 bushels) of wheat might besecured for the United Kingdom and the Colonies. The latest indications from australia are to the effect that about 2 million tons (75 million bushels) may beavailable. This would leave some 900,000 tons of wheat available for the UnitedKingdom, of which it is estimated that 460,000 tons should reach United kingdom ports by 30th June. It was previously expected that the flour available from australia for the Far East would amount to 662,000 tons in 1948, but this may nowbe reduced to 500,000 tons, involving a provision of approximately 100,000 tons from Canada at the expense of the United Kingdom, during the.period January-,J^une 1948. The effect of this on the United Kingdom stock position is referred toin the notes on Tables I and II. Other countries, including India and Eire, will be anxious to obtain Australian wheat and to accelerate its shipment. The operational resources of Australia will be severely taxed in meeting these demands.The supply of labour and bags will probably be inadequate for the handling of th.large quantities of wheat and flour. The Australian Railways are also likely tobe in serious difficulties in moving these quantities.(c) ArgentinaAllowance has been made for the arrival of 367,000 tons, this being thebalance of the United Kingdom Contract for 500,000 tons and no provision hasbeen made for the further purchase of wheat in the Argentine. Grain exports from the Plate are moving with distressing slowness and United Kingdom ship-ments may be further retarded if India, Italy and other exporters are to be ableto lift the substantial quantities of grain which the Argentine has promised tosupply for shipment by the end of December. Moreover, the United Kingdom-Programme calls for heavy shipments of feed grains and oilcakes during this
period. Apart from the question of internal movement and port clearance, diffi-1culties have already arisen regarding the convertibility of sterling, and unless &amp;satisfactory solution can be found to this problem a suspension or even a completecessation of shipments may occur at any time.(d) United states as in the case of the Argentine, provision has been made only for the shipment of the small balance of our commitments prior to the embargo on hard currencypurchases of wheat and flour.4. Possible Additional Sources of Supply: U.S.S.R. and Eastern EuropeanCountriesRussia seems to be in a position to export substantial quantities of wheat in1947-48. When the abortive negotiations were proceeding in Moscow during the summer for a trade agreement between the U.S.S.R. and the United Kingdom it-looked as though at least 500,000 tons and possibly as much as 1 million tons might then have been made available to the United Kingdom. Other commitments mayhave altered this prospect. Nevertheless, an appreciable quantity of RussianWheat might still be obtainable, but little of it would be likely to reach the UnitedKingdom before the late spring of 1948. Shipments would have to be made fromOdessa, where port facilities may be heavily taxed as it is understood that substan-tial allocations have already been made to other countries.None of the Balkan countries is likely to have any surplus wheat for exportin 1947-48.5. International Emergency Food Council ProgrammingCanada, United States and Australia, as members of the I.E.F.C., haveregard in their export programmes to the distribution programmes recommendedby the Cereals Committee of the I.E.F.C. This is a factor which must not be overlooked in connection with the forward supply prospects of the United King-dom. In view of the overall deficit between the stated requirements of the importing countries and the quantity available for export the I.E.F.C. CerealsCommittee is closely scrutinising and, in most cases, making substantial reductions in the quantities which the importing countries have submitted as their statedrequirements. No apportionment has yet been made by the I.E.F.C. for the sixmonths January to June 1948, but on the basis of the one made for the six monthsJuly to December 1947 the United Kingdom position over the twelvei. monthsJuly 1947 to June 1948 may work out as follows : Thousand tonsUnited Kingdom import requirements for 1947-48wheat/flour ...      ...      .........      ...      5,886Assumed I.E.F.C. apportionment 1947-48 wheat/flour      4,634Estimated shipments to United Kingdom, 1947-48wheat/flour ...      ...      ...      ......      ...      5,120For the twelve months, therefore, it would appear that, although the totalshipped will fall short of our stated requirements by 766,000 tons, it may exceed the quantity of wheat/flour apportioned by the I.E.F.C. by 486,000 tons, and thatthe question of an adjustment as between shipments and the I.E.F.C. apportion-ment may arise. If larger quantities were imported with a view to meeting ahigher rate of flour consumption, the quantity which would need adjustment withthe I.E.F.C. would, of course, be even larger than indicated by the above figures.6. Flour off take(a) In the appended tables flour disappearances have been calculated on three alternative assumptions : (i) An off take of the order of 103,000 tons per week. At present the averageofftake is below this figure (in the last three weeks, 102,300, 102,100and 102,300), but the trend is upwards and the approaching wintermay accelerate this tendency, while the limiting influence of the ration-ing scheme will presumably continue to weaken. Conversely, of course,these assumptions may prove to be unfounded and 103,000 tons perweek may provide for a margin of safety so long as bread rationingcontinues.
(ii) If, however, 103,000 tons per week is the probable off take under ratioh-ing it must be assumed that unrestricted consumption ivould resultin some higher figure. The second hypothesis of an off take of 106,000tons per week from December 1947 is therefore an arbitrary selection,but it does.indicate the possible effect on the United Kingdom stock position if it should be decided to abolish bread rationing and at the&apos;same time allow for the use of bread to make good some reductionin the availability of other food-stuffs. It would, however, be insuffi-cient to compensate for any substantial cut in the supply of potatoes,(iii) In the third alternative assumption, i.e:, an off take of 110,000 tons perweek from December 1947, endeavour has been made to evaluate interms of flour disappearance the effect of drastic cuts in the supply!of other food stuffs, but if, in particular, the potato shortage provesto be as large as is at present estimated, even 110,000 tons per weekmay fall short of actual off take. Apart from the legitimate use of. bread to make good the loss of other foods, the use of flour and breadfor animal feeding might be very considerable and could not be effectively controlled. Flour is cheap in comparison with unrationedfeeding-stuffs. ,(b) No final assessment is at present possible of the extent to which cuts,in other food-stuffs, including potatoes, may reduce the total food off take, conse-quently no precise calculation can be made as to the extent to which these cutscould be made good by increasing bread consumption. If potato consumption is reduced from b\ lb. to 3J- lb. per head per week there is bound to be a substantial increase in the demand for bread and if it be assumed that the additional breadin the form of a small loaf (14 oz.) or a large loaf (1 lb. 12 oz.) is made availablein lieu of potatoes to certain groups of consumers or to the whole of the popula-tion the effect would be as follows : Increase iff terms Additional flour required. Population group. of bread per week. per week in thousand tonsAdolescents    ...      ... &apos;       JJoz.11 to 17 only ...                   1 lb. 12 oz. 2-68 ;5 to 17 years  -    -         ^JJ-. .    %\Whole of population ...               14oz. 18-9(48-4 million) ...      ...         Ub.l2oz.To allow one additional 14-oz. loaf per head of population would, therefore,represent 13,900 tons of flour per week in addition to the current average off take&apos;of around 100,000 tons, a total disappearance of 114,000 tons per week. Thisjcould not be met from the supplies available.Part II-Coarse Grains1. Requirements and Probable SuppliesAs the animal feeding-stuffs rationing scheme is administered under twounequal periods during the year, with the heavier demand in the longer or winterperiod, it is desirable to consider them separately. The winter period of seven months extends from 1st October to 30th April, while the summer period, duringwhich pasturage and grazing are available, has a course of five months from 1st May to 30th September.For the winter period commencing October 1947 it is estimated that, to meetthe ration scales as authorised by the Ministry of Agriculture, a total of 1,644,000tons of feeding stuffs will be required. This is in excess of the ration issues forthe corresponding period of 1946-47 by about 510,000 tons, but falls short of the
level of coupon issues for the corresponding period of 1945-46 by 140,000 tons..Stocks at the beginning of October 1947 were 338,000 tons comprising :- -TonsLow Protein   ...      ...    - v.. &apos; .   ...      ...      ...        59,000Home Grown Barley ...      , w/    ...      .&apos;.-.      ...      171,000Imported Barley      ...      .........      ... 6,000Imported Maize       ...      ......      ......      102,000-   ,  . 338,000Assumed supplies in October-April are of the order of 1,496,000 tons (see table IV) representing a total availability of 1,834,000 tons, and as rationrequirements will absorb 1,644,000 tons, a carry-over of only about 190,000 tons at end April 1948 is indicated. This low figure gives rise to grave concern asit has hitherto been considered necessary to maintain a carry-over stock of notless than 250,000 tons, and in view of &quot;the increased distribution requirements350,000 tons would be nearer the desirable total. To attain this, however, increased imports of 160,000 tons would be necessary during the period in question.For the Summer period May^September imported supplies fall considerably,and it seems likely that the balance of imports purchased to date, plus home-produced supplies, after allowing for the presently programmed utilisation for human and industrial purposes, will provide a total of 834,000 tons. Unless,therefore, further imports can be secured we shall be unable to meet our present level of off take, which calls for approximately 950,000 tons and maintain aminimum stock of 250,000 tons. The apparent deficit is 176,000 tons which wouldbe increased to around 750,000 tons if the full programme now envisaged wereto be realised. .., .     -   2. Additional Import requirements to: implement the Government^ policy of increased livestock production,particularly of pigs and poultry, it is apparent that imports over and. above the quantities now in sight will be necessary. The present position is, moreover,unsatisfactory because of our almost complete dependence on the Argentine for imported supplies, and, for the reasons stated in Part I of this memorandum,there must be a very real element of doubt as to whether these supplies can beregarded as reasonably assured. Any failure to secure the supplies programmedfrom this source, would involve a curtailment of the cereal feeding stuns rationto an extent which would mean, at any rate, the slowing down of the long-term plan of stock rehabilitation. The extent of our dependency upon Argentinabecomes even more apparent when it is realised that through the cereal year1947-48 we had anticipated receiving upwards of half a million tons of maizefrom the United. States. It is now evident that the production of new crop maizein the United States will not be sufficient to meet even domestic requirements onthe present scale, and it is likely that considerable quantities of wheat will befed to livestock to make good the shortfall of maize. The likelihood of any maizebeing exported is remote.3. Oats(a) GeneralThe general outlook as regards supplies of oats for oatmeal milling and forfeeding essential horses during the crop year 1947-48 requires immediate con-sideration of measures to meet the new scarcity conditions. Under existing arrangements, oats are a free crop in the sense that growers may either use theiroats on their farms for animal feed or sell them to authorised buyers or to this ministry. Normally oats so sold are bought by oatmeal millers or for feedingessential horses. The 1947 oat harvest was the smallest for many years and feedrequirements are likely to result in only relatively small quantities beihg sold offfarms before the next harvest. Imports will also be on a very reduced scale. Itwill be impossible, therefore, to meet all requirements in full. Of necessity,essential horses have first claim on available supplies, but this priority cannot been forced so long as oatmeal millers are free to buy home-grown oats and to selltheir products as at present, and unless steps are taken to remedy this the require-ments of essential horses cannot be assured. As oats are in short supply Ministrypurchases are reserved; for essential horses,, and it has been assumed that no oats-will be available for animal feeding stuffs rations in Table IV. &apos;&apos;
(fe) Home-grown supplies of oats in 1947-48The following table compares estimated supplies from the 1947 crop with theactual figures for 1946 : llome-Grown Supplies1947-48 as :A ctual Figures       estimated atfor 1946-47 17th September. --    a--&apos;- (000 tons)     ..     ,       .Production   ...      ...      ......      2,903 -2,539     .- -: Farm Retentions...........      2,274 (78-4%)      2,200 (86-5%)Sales to Authorised Buyers        ... 629 339Of which sold f of Seed      ...      ...      ...... 149 130Feed      ...      ...      ...      ... 35 20Net sales to Authorised Buyers orto the Ministry ...      ... 445 189The 1947 crop estimate provided by the Ministry of Agriculture on 17thSeptember is subject to revision, but no wide variation either way is anticipatedas weather conditions were favourable for harvesting. On the other hand, theestimate of farm retentions is highly tentative; in the past five years it has variedbetween 70 5 per cent, and 78-4 per cent., but it does not follow that retentionswill fall within these limits this year. Farmers&apos; needs for animal feed do notdiminish with a small crop; on the contrary, they tend to retain a higher propor-tioh when as this year, the crop is small. Moreover, this season there is the psychological effect of the promised increase in rations next year. The com-paratively high estimate of 86-5 per cent, for 1947-48 takes this into account andalso the shortage of other kinds of feed due to the drought.(c) Total Supplies and Utilisation in 1947-48 &quot;    :The following table summarises prospective supplies and utilisation duringthe crop year, August 1947 to July 1948 : &apos; Total Supply and UtilisationPresent .&apos;   Actual figures   estimates for for 1946-47        1947-48Stocks at 1st August:  (000 tons)Home Grown       ...      ...      ...      ...        39 9Imported    ...       ......      ...      ...        83 105&apos;&apos; Total Stocks        ....      ...      ...      ...      122 114Imports during year   ...      ...      ...      ... 165 ...Sales  of  home-grown oats  to  AuthorisedBuyers or Ministry        ...      ...      ... 445 189Total   supplies   for   oatmeal   millers   and-- ... - essential horses    ...      ...      ... 732 303Utilisation:-Oatmeal millers   ... ... ... ... 385 Y KQP         .Essential horses   ... ... ... ... 210 J other uses, e.g., feed ... ... ... 23 23618 253Stocks 31st July...       ...      ...&quot;    ...      ...      114 50Note -&quot; Other uses&quot; relates to oats which are unsuitable for oatmeal or for essential horses.34428d
Stocks : -       V .  ,    OL&apos;      IThe minimum end of season stock of 50,000 tons of oats suitable for millingor horse feeding is regarded as a necessary reserve against the risk of a late orpoor harvest and because new oats cannot be fed to horses. By working Ministrystocks to this minimum 64,000 tons can be released to supplement supplies fromthe 1947 harvest; unfortunately, the greater part of this has already beenconsumed.ImportsProvision has been made in the import programme, which has yet tq be approved by the Treasury, for the import of 100,000 tons of oats during 1947x48.Normally there are many sources of supply, e.g., Canada, United States, Australia,Morocco, Chile, Russia and Argentina, but no purchases have so far been made against the 1947-48 programme. Owing to reduced maize and oat crops in north america, no further exports can be counted upon from that source before theUnited Kingdom 1948 oat crop is harvested, but, nevertheless, the possibilityof securing some Canadian supplies is being explored. Enquiries are also beingmade in Argentina, which is the most likely, source, but it is not possible to say what quantities of suitable quality may be bought there for shipment to thiscountry during 1947-48. Small quantities may be obtainable from other sources.On present prospects, however, it is doubtful whether the full programme willbe implemented on supply grounds; and Treasury sanction would have to besecured before any offers could be accepted.Utilisation &quot; ;For 36 weeks of 1946-47, utilisation by oatmeal millers was restricted bythe temporary extension of points rationing to oatmeal as Well as to oat flakes,but since 30th March 1947, when oatmeal was taken off points, the demand foroatmeal and other oat products has increased (partly due to illicit feeding toanimals) and it is estimated that to sustain the uncontrolled distribution ofoatmeal, millers would require 440,000 tons of oats through 1947-48 as comparedwith 385,000 in 1946-47. Requirements for essential horses in&apos; 1947-48 are estimated at 220,000 as compared with &quot;210,000 in 1946-47. Total estimated requirements for these two purposes in 1947-48 are, therefore, 660,000 tons,Imports may possibly result in some increase in the 230,000 tons, estimatedavailability, but it is clear that supplies will in any case fall far short of require-:ments, and even given complete control over distribution from the beginning ofthe crop year they would barely cover the needs of essential horses. On the otherhand, oatmeal millers have been buying heavily since the harvest, and, in theabsence of imports, considerable difficulty will undoubtedly be experienced in meeting requirements of essential horses in full even if steps are taken immediately to conserve supplies for this purpose.4.

As regardsimported supplies, it has been assumed that in addition to 10,000 tons of australian barley held by the Ministry at the beginning of the crop year, 180,000tons will be received from Argentina out of the recent purchases from that source.The figures relate to the crop year August 1947-July 1948, and are not thereforestrictly comparable with the figures in Table IV, which relate to the periodOctober 1947-September 1948; but the basic assumptions are&quot; common to both.(c) Requirements of Brewers, Maltsters, &amp;c.The provision in paragraph 4 (a) for brewing, malting, &amp;c, assumes a continuation of production at the present level, and that there will not be any restriction of production due to fuel shortages during the coming winter; it includes 24,000 tons for production of beer and malt for export and a reasonablemargin, 24,000 tons, for contingencies (e.g., N.A.A.F.I. requirements). As regardsexports to Eire for production of Guinness for the United Kingdom, the ministry is already committed to supply 30,000 tons for this purpose in 1947-48. Beerproduction is at present restricted to 85 per cent, of the standard barrelageproduced during the datum period of twelve months ended 31st March, 1946. Afurther reduction of 5 per cent; in standard barrelage, i.e,, to 80 per cent, ofdatum, should release 43,000 tons of barley over a period of twelve months.Brewers have so far been licensed to purchase up to 80 per cent, of their require-ments of barley from the 1947 crop at the present rate of production. i,e., sufficient34428 d 2Disposal of Home-Grown Crop
to produce almost 70 per cent, of standard barrelage in the datum period. given  an early decision to cut beer production it should be possible, therefore, to gainthe full benefit of the saving of barley from the 1947 crop. The quantities avail-able for animal feeding shown in paragraph 4 (b) would be increased accordingly.(d) Requirements for distillingWhen operating at full capacity, distillers could probably utilise between250,000 and 300,000 tons of barley a year, and the industry has been hoping toobtain something approaching this quantity from the 1947 barley crop as comparedwith the average of a little over 100,000 tons a year, since the use of barley fordistilling was resumed just three years ago.While releases of whisky for export and home consumption are not relateddirectly to the size of the allocation of barley, the latter has been associated withthe negotiations for larger exports and will undoubtedly influence the trade&apos;swillingness to continue the present high level of exports. The agreement withthe trade, operative from 1st May, 1947, provides for release of whisky for homeand export markets at the rate of 30-4 million proof gallons a year; 75 per cent,of releases of whisky are now beim cported and efforts are being made to increasedollar earnings by diverting a It. &apos;er proportion of whisky exports away fromsoft currency destinations. The .. n00 tons of barley allocated to distillers inApril 1947, together with the 75,00u tons allocated in August (mainly 1947 crop)will just about enable distillers to replenish stocks to the extentx)f one year&apos;srelease of whisky at the agreed rate, i.e., to April 1948. The allocation of another75,000 tons would replenish releases at the agreed rate for the period May^-October 1948 and should thus tide distillers over until 1948 crop barley couldbe allocated. On the other hand, looked at from the viewpoint of production, theallocation of 75,000 tons would not keep the distilleries going beyond April andthey would be faced with a temporary interruption of production until the 1948crop barley could be allocated. This may not be at all satisfactory, but, havingregard to the overall supply prospects for coarse grains, not more than 75,000 tonsof barley can be spared at the present time and it is most doubtful whether anymore can be made available from the 1947 crop. If the distillers are to be allocatedfurther supplies, it is desirable that they should be authorised to start buyingthe additional quantity as soon as possible; otherwise barley of the qualitiesneeded by them may be taken by other consumers or by the Ministry. It shouldbe made a condition of the release of this 75,000 tons that the undertakings ofdistillers to maximise exports should be maintained. Provision has been madefor this quantity in the table in paragraph 4 (a).(e) Australian BarleyForecasts of the exportable surplus of Australian malting barley from the crop to . be harvested in October-November 1947 vary between 150,000 and200,000 tons and the United Kingdom may be able to secure 100,000 tons at aprice not exceeding  34 per ton f .o.b. In view of the urgent need to increase ourgrain supplies, it is hoped that Treasury authority will be granted.(/) U.S.S.R. Coarse GrainsDuring the negotiations in Moscow last summer the Russians indicatedwillingness, if a trade agreement satisfactory to them could be reached, to provide1 million tons of cereals from the 1947 harvest, of which about half would bewheat and half coarse grain. Our negotiators were of the opinion that the total quantity might, if sufficient inducement was offered to the Russians, have been increased up to 1\ million tons. In that event 750,000 tons would have consisted of coarse grain. The precise quantities of each of the varieties of coarse grainthat might have been available cannot be stated, but it is thought that around500,000-550,000 tons would have been barley and the balance oats and maize.5. Maize(a) Supply Prospects &apos;Almost the only source from which the United Kingdom will be able to drawsupplies of maize during 1947-48 is Argentina. Out of purchases from this source (including 750,000 tons from the 1947 crop) 784,000 tons were afloat orremained to be shipped at 1st October, 1947, and this quantity has been pro-grammed to arrive at United Kingdom ports before 30th September, 1948.   This
assumes there will be no suspension of shipments due to question of converti-bility. Additional supplies from this year&apos;s Argentine, crop cannot be looked for as Argentina has already sold for export far more maize than it will be possibleto ship before the crop to be harvested in March-June 1948 begins to move. Itis also unlikely that any purchases by the United Kingdom out of the new cropcould arrive in time to affect the position to end September 1948.The present estimate of the position in other exporting countries is asfollows :- -(i) Hard currency sourcesUnited States. The 1947 maize crop shows a reduction on the previous year of about 16 million tons, and it is unlikely that any maize will be exported until after the 1948 harvest.Brazil: The possible exportable surplus from the 1947 crop is presentlyestimated at about 50,000 tons in addition to an unknown quantity carried over from the previous crops. This quantity would be reduced, however, by.any increase in Domestic Consumption due to a reduction in imports ofwheat-. We have so far negotiated the purchase of 40,000 tons, but sincesterling ceased to be convertible, we have had increasing difficulty in shipping the quantities bought, and contracts for at least 12,000 tons have been cancelled. Endeavour is being made to persuade shippers either to get; sterling accepted for our purchases, or to hold the maize until financial conditions improve, but it is impossible at this stage to do more than hopethat the balance of our purchases will be shipped during 1947-48.(ii) Softer currency sourcesU.S.S.R.-The final offer of maize by the Russians before the July 1947negotiations were broken off amounted to some 120,000 tons from the 1947crop, but it is thought that a larger quantity could be got if sufficient induce-ment is offered. Whether supplies could be shipped in sufficient volume tohave any appreciable effect on the United Kingdom position during the period to end September 1948, is, however, problematical.Roumania. Official statistics indicate that Roumania may have forexport about 250,000 tons in addition to the 250,000 tons she has alreadycontracted to deliver to Czechoslovakia. A Ministry of Food representativewho has recently returned from Roumania reports, however, that on the basisof a harvest in the region of 6 million tons a quantity of half a million tonsshould be available for purchase by the United Kingdom, provided &quot; we can come to terms,&quot; i.e., are prepared to supply Roumania with the UnitedKingdom goods she wants.Yugoslavia. -Anglo-Yugoslav trade talks are at present in suspense,awaiting an offer of cereals by the Yugoslavs. The information availableindicates that some 250,000 tons of maize should be available for export overand above 100,000 tons contracted to Czechoslovakia. Here, again, thepossibility of an agreement depends upon being able to assure to Yugoslaviathe United Kingdom goods she desires.In the following table account has been taken of the arrival of only that&apos;quantity of &quot;maize which we have already purchased in Argentina, 3,000 tonsnow afloat from Brazil, and 6,000 tons afloat from the United States.Estimated Available Supplies October&apos; 1947&apos;-September 1948Stock at end September 1947  .

the United Kingdom and 3,6,000 tons on the continent. Owing to the consequentloss of starch supplies from hard currency sources an additional 54,600 tons of,maize will have to be found for processing in the United Kingdom and on thecontinent. This brings the total requirement of maize for starch to 150,600 tons.Of this quantity 40,000 tons will be found by the diversion of a like amount fromcereal breakfast food manufacture.For Cereal Breakfast Foods &apos;The quantity of maize required for the manufacture of breakfast foods onthe basis of the full programmed output is 90,000 tons. Monthly off take has,however, been well below this rate and it is doubtful in present circumstanceswhether manufacturers could process the full quantity, even if the maize couldbe made available. It will, therefore, be possible to divert 40,000 tons to starchmanufacture, as stated in the preceding paragraph. If, however, the maizeavailable for breakfast foods is reduced below 50,000 tons it would be necessary toconsider the use of wheat in place of maize.For Glucose. Manufacture     -The quantity pf maize programmed for 1947-48 for the manufacture ofglucose is 66,000 tons.- For Animal FeedThe requirements of cereal feeding stuffs are referred to in detail in para-graph 1 of this part. For the period October 1947-April 1948 1,644,000 tons willbe required and for May-September 1948 about 950,000 tons. On the basis ofthese requirements, which are at current ration levels, there is a deficit of 60,000tons over the winter ration period October 1947-April. 1948 which will beincreased by &quot;a further 116,000 tons over the period May-September 1948 ifprovision is to he made for minimum carry-over stocks. If this deficit were tobe made good in maize it would be necessary to import an additional 176,000 tonsbefore 30th September, 1948.These figures take no account of the planned increase in live-stock numbers and to meet the expanded programme for the period May-September 1948 afurther 500v700,000 tons additional to the above-mentioned total would berequired..    , /ay.&apos;&quot;.In arriving at the residual quantity of maize available for animal feeding,allowance has been made only for the minimum human and industrial require-ments. Further saving could only be effected at the cost of the essential needs forstarch, glucose and cereal breakfast foods.ANNEX IIIMemorandum to the Minister of Food by the Head of the British Food- .      Mission in WashingtonYou asked me to put in writing my views on our chance of securing up to400,000 tons of. wheat ih the United States for delivery before the end of Aprilor early in May. - -1. The history of our dealings with Clinton Anderson and his department in respect of wheat and flour so far this season is relevant. Briefly, the varioussteps nave been as follows : (a) In the spring you visited Washington and obtained from Anderson a promise that at least 300,000 tons of wheat and flour would be delivered to us in approximately the third quarter of this year.(&amp;) We received no allocation for July. We thereupon pressed theDepart-ment to confirm the Secretary&apos;s undertaking to you. This confirmationwas secured, although the delivery period was extended until the endof October.(c) The August allocation was very small.   The September allocation waslarger, but inadequate. However, when it was announced towardsthe end of July, I was given a personal message from the Secretarystating that everything would, be done to give us an additionalallocation for September, amounting perhaps to 50,000 tons.(d) Early in August the decision was made, and publicly announced, thatwe would make no new purchases in dollars. I was, therefore, unableto pursue with the Department of Agriculture the question of a supplementary allocation for September, and it lapsed.   When the
October allocation was announced, we were unable to obtain Treasurypermission to take it up. In rejecting it I secured an undertaking from the Department of Agriculture that they would be prepared toinclude the original October allocation in a subsequent programme and would endeavour to make the grain available as promptly aspossible following a request from us.(e) Meanwhile, the Cereals Committee of the I.E.F.C., in its attempt to draw up a total international allocation, had informally suggested that theUnited Kingdom should receive the 300,000 tons of wheat from theUnited States in the second half of M48r\ , 2. Expressed in terms of wheat equivalent, we have been allocated from july to October 168,500 tons for the United Kingdom and might have receivedperhaps 50,000 tons more. We have also received 53,000 tons for Colonial areasin the Pacific. Of these allocations we have taken up 97,000 tons for the UnitedKingdom and the entire quantity for the Colonial areas.Thus we have good grounds for expecting that a request for an additional; 300,000 tons of wheat would&apos;meet with success, so far as the past record of our negotiations bears upon the matter. At the minimum we would have a good case for arguing that we should be able to buy at least 203,000 tons, i.e., the balanceof the 3^^O0g tons originally promised us, but not yet bought.3. I am, however, doubtful whether in practice we would find the Depart-ment of Agriculture, or the American Administration, willing at this moment tosell us any substantial quantity of wheat, unless we required it urgently toprevent a breakdown in the bread ration. My reasons for this view are several :-(i) Since my discussions regarding the September and October allocations,our negotiations for the purchase of large additional quantities of australian wheat have progressed well towards finality. This is anew factor in our supply position.(ii) During August and September, i.e., after Clinton Anderson&apos;s originalundertaking had been given, the United States grain supplies&quot; diminished substantially, due to the relative failure of the corn crop,(iii) The price of wheat in Chicago has risen enormously, and the higher it.   ,     rises, the less willing is the United States Administration to purchasegrain for export, and the greater is the proof they will demand of theneed of importing countries for United States grain:-&apos;.     (iv) In terms of assured bread-grain supplies, the United Kingdom is in a relatively more favourable situation than any other importing country.At the same time, the demand of other importing countries is increasing in urgency, and certainly will continue to become more urgent as the end of the crop year approaches...; &apos;T* therefore, conclude that while we have a good legal case, the United states administration would be reluctant to give us permission to buy substantial-quantities of wheat so long as we were facing no serious crisis in our breadgrain supplies. I have no doubt that their reluctance would increase, the breadsupply position of the world being what it is, in so far.as their sales were for thepurpose of helping us remove bread from the ration.4. There is one other aspect which I believe should be considered. on general political grounds, it is, I think, arguable that the present moment is aninappropriate one for this country to make any such request of the United states administration. It is certainly true that pur bread-grain and food supply situation is much better than that of most other European countries represented on the Committee of European Economic Co-operation, and I think it is to beexpected that the United States Administration, with every justification, would consider a request for more wheat in order that we might de-ration bread as\evidence of something approaching non-co-operation with the European countries concerned.   It must also be borne in mind that for weeks and months past, the: United States Administration has been receiving constant and urgent requestsi for large supplies of grain for India.(Signed) M. I.

Arrivals canada: Realistic estimate of-quantities expected to arrive by end June 1948, assuming that 330,000 tons of the contract quantity will remain for shipment after the end of the contract year. These figures allow for quantities for these L.F.C. areas of United Kingdom procurement responsibility as shown in Table HI..united states: Balance of allocations up to September. ...  &apos; . .argentina: Balance of arrivals from contract for 500,000 tons for 1947.australia: It is estimated that 600,000 tons will beavailable for shipment to the United Kmgdom between December 1947 and June 1948. -.l.......................u.s.s.r.: In the absence of an agreement with the U.S.S.R. no supplies have been counted upon from this source.2.   Receipts of Home-Grown Grain: For crop year August 1947 to July 1948 estimated at 1,200,000 tons.3.   Extraction Rate: 85 per cent, throughout. If the extraction rate is reduced from 85 per cent, to 80 per cent. from..the beginning of December 1947, the increased utilisation of wheat formilling will reduce the stocks of wheat-at end June 1948 by about 210,000 tons. rvNote. Total expected purchases of 662,000 tons flour from Australia in 1948 may be reduced to 500,000 tons. This would mean a deficit of about 100,000 tons of flour for the-Far East during january/June 1948 which would have to be made good from Canadian supplies, thus reducing the quantity available for the United Kingdom by an equivalent amount. The cumulative effecton United Kingdom stocks would be a reduction by end June 1948&apos; of about 120,000 tons wheat in (Sections A and b of Table II) and 100,000 tons flour in Section C of Table I.^ &apos; Statistics ano Intelligence Division (Cereals Group) as at 13th October, 1947.

Of outstanding purchases of 36,000 tonsonly 2,000 tons was shipped during the first week of October, since when shipments have been suspended owing to currency difficulties.Argentine maize-quantity afloat end September 1947 was 54,000 tons. Of total new crop purchases of 750,000 tons, 730,000 tons remains to be shipped from October onwards.Shipments of maize are estimated at 90,000 tons per month for December to April&apos;and on this basis the whole of the balance; should arrive by end September 1948. Such a high level of maizeshipments has not been reached in recent months owing to priority for wheat, and large quantitiesof barley are programmed for shipment in, October/November. It is anticipated, however, thatmaize shipments will improve considerably when the bulk of the wheat and barley has been cleared.Total purchases of 750,000 tons include 25,000 tons originally bought for Egypt, but now destined for the United Kingdom.
Maize for processing on ike Continent The original requirement of maize for processing into starch on the Continent was 36,000 tons.Owing to reduced imports of United States and Dutch starch, the total requirements of maize hasnow been increased by 94-6 thousand tons. This increase will be met in part by reducing supplies to breakfast food manufacturers by 40,000 tons, i.e., from 90,000 tons to 50,000 tons, and a further14- 6 thousand tons has also been allowed for, so as to coyer minimum essential needs. This leavesa deficit of 40,000 tons on the revised total requirements. In the above table provision has therefore been made for a total of 50,000 tons for breakfast food manufacturers and 91,000 tons for processingon the Continent.Animal Feed The total quantity available for feed and stock on the above basis is 611,000 tons.25th October, 1947.Statistics and Intelligence Division.(Cereals Group).
