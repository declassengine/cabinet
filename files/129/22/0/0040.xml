199(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (47) 330 COPY NO.16TH DECEMBER.  1947CABINETItOIL SUPPLIESJoint Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of transport and -the Minister of Fuel and Power-- In Memoranda &apos;to the Production Committee on the oilsituation (P.C. (47) 24) and on tankers (P.C.(47) 26), weexplained in general terms the serious&apos; implications of theBritish Oil Companies&apos;  tanker shortage and our proposals fordealing with it during the first quarter of 1948.     Our specific recommendations, contained in this paper, require the approvalof the Cabinet, since they affect the United Kingdom import programme and involve&apos;substantial adjustments to our deliveries of oil to foreign countries and to the programmes of the service departments, notably the Admiralty./V-:-S-  : -.&apos;.&apos;&apos;       &apos;&apos;&apos;.Y&apos; &quot;- *2.      The British Oil Companies expect to he able to produce orpurchase enough oil to meet their programmes with, the exceptionof a possible marginal deficit in gas oil and a relatively small,but growing, &quot;uncovered&quot; bunker requirement, but they cannot moveall of this oil to.places of consumption because they are short of carrying capacity to the extent of about 13$ of their total requirements.3. The United Kingdom and the sterling areas depend for partof their supplies on oil supplied and shipped by American oil companies. These are expected to he able to . supply :their fullshare of the market during- the first quarter of 194-8, but in sofar as this expectation is unfulfilled, the temporary positionwould be so much worse. This memorandum is however concernedsolely with the British Companies&apos; position..4.  .   The tanker shortage is equivalent to 32 American fasttankers (T.2&apos;s) or, expressed in terms of deliveries of oil to the United Kingdom, It represents.a short-fall of 1.3 million tons in the first quarter.     The shortage is expressed in termsof deliveries to the United Kingdom-purely as a convenientmeasure and does not imply that supplies to the United kingdom will, in faot, be reduced by that amount.     Among the various ways of bridging the gap, which this memorandum vjets out toexamine, a reduction of supplies to the United Kingdom is onlyone possibility.5.      Theoretically, the gap might be bridged in either or bothof two ways &apos;&apos;(a) by finding more tankers for commercial programmes;(b) by cutting down the programmes themselves.Both of these possibilities have been carefully examined.-T-
6.     Prospects of finding more tankersThere is a world shortage of tankers at the present time.This will not he eased until the second quarter of 1948 when mostof the tankers now being withdrawn from lay-up in the UnitedStates should be in service.     The British Companies position will then depend on the s trength of American competition, onour dollar position and on the prospects of aid under the marshall plan.     Meanwhile, the British Companies have no prospect of covering their deficit in the first quarter by commercial chartering.     Nevertheless, they are negotiating for &apos;the chartering of 9 Liberty tankers in the U.S.A. and if, asthey expect,  these ships are ready in January, 1948, anadditional 120,000 tons will be shipped in the first quarter.In reply to the request of, the Ministry of Transport forIk tankers (equivalent to 10 T,2&apos;s) in continuous employment in1948, the Admiralty have already promised 7 tankers in additionto 3 already employed on commercial, s ervice for commercialvoyages throughout the first quarter.      The effect of this will ,be to reduce the deficit by about 180,000 tons during the quarter.Additional tankers, in prospect will thus reduce the deficitas follows;- ^Thousand tons total deficit 1334Deliveries by additional-&apos; foliar, tankers 120Deliveries by promised,7 Admiralty tankers (inaddition to 3 already . v&apos; provided). 180Total additional deliveries 300Residual deficit 10347.   &apos; If the proposals.in P.C.(47) 24 are accepted, namely^ for the postponement of stock-building in the United Kingdom (264,000 tonsin the quarter, which is the only provision for stock building inthe programme) and for calling a halt to coal/oil conversionprojects (which ought to produce, a saving of 40,000 tons in thefirst quarter^) and we are able, as we hope, to save 30,000 tonsof gas oil by reduction of the manufacture of carburetted watergas, a total saving in the United Kingdom programme of 334,000tons would result.      The&apos; reduction in actual consumption, viz&apos;.70,000 tons represents about 2% of the estimated total UnitedKingdom consumption in the first quarter.      These proposalsrepresent the limit of reduction of the United Kingdom programme which has. already been reduced to the minimum consistent withthe maintenance of supplies.for industry; of essential transport,and of. bunker requirements.8.     Following our reduction .and later abolition of the basicpetrol ration and the introduction of other economies in the useof petrol, the Dominions and Colonies generally are reducing theiroverall&apos; consumption of motor spirit by about 10%.     They were alsowarned as long ago as last August that owing to the supply ands   The precise figures will depend on a review to be undertaken by the Petroleum Board.

It would certainly be easier to persuade them toaccept a cut if it is decided to slow down the coal/oilconversion programme in this country.     The maximum saving inBritish companies&apos; supplies which might be secured in the first quarter of 1948 would probably he 570 (say 3^% of total suppliesi.e.  including supplies from American companies) - 90,000 tons?but owing to the longer haul this can only be taken as representing a 50,000 tons contribution to the deficit expressed .in terms of shipment to the United Kingdom,     It looks, therefore,as if the most we can save by reduction of the United Kingdomand Commonwealth programme will bes-Thousand tons of oilUnited Kingdom(a) Postponement-of stock-building 26k(b).

Bunker supplies to ships have already teen drasticallyscreened by the Companies,     The Shell Company - alone have cutout a long list of 1947 customers with a -stated demand of5 million, tons in 1948.     To meet this increased demand, an allowance of only 300,000 tons has been made in the first quarterof the year and it is clear that&apos;nothing less than this provision will keep ships running.      It is probable that ships not serving the British economy will be restricted as to oil supplies during the first quarter of 1948.10.    Allowing for these savings and for the additional tonnage in prospect, we are left with a deficit of about 650,000..11.    The Admiralty are considering whether, they can make furtherfive tankers, available for the first quarter of 1948 (even though this will involve some reduction in their stocks) in the expectation that there will be&apos; reduced, demands on the admiralty for tanker assistance in the remaining quarters of the year..It is estimated that these five, tankers would reduce the deficitby a further 135,000 tons during the quarter.      If.this is thebest that the Admiralty can do (we had certainly hoped for more)the whole of the rest of the deficit, viz 500,000 will have tobe met by withdrawing tankers from trade with foreign countries.,The British Companies only provide tankers for the c,i.f.part of their trade which will represent .in 1948 about 38%of their total foreign trade.      For the other 62$ -sold f.o.b.,the purchaser finds the tankers.      Before the war the bulk oftheir foreign trade was on ac,i.f. basis.      The -percentagesquoted show the lengths to which the Companies, in order toreduce their tanker commitments, have already gone in substitutingf.o.b. for c.i.f. deliveries.      In the opinion of the Companies,
202the policy of substitution has for the time being reached thelimit beyond which any&apos;reduction of c.i.f. sales means inpractice a corresponding reduction in oil supplies, since thepurchasers would be unable to find tankers to fetch the oilit offered f.o.b.     The recent decision by the United StatesAttorney-General that the Maritime Commission may proceedwith sales of T.2 tankers already promised to foreign nationals&apos;may help France and Italy but probably not until towards the endof the quarter.      It will not be until the world tonnageposition eases that the foreign, like the British chartererwill be able to find more tonnage for his import requirements.12.    To meet the deficit of 500,000 tons, c.i.f. sales toforeign countries would have to be reduced by k1%; representing a cut of 15% on total supplies (c.i.f. and f.-o.b. together).A cut of this order, even if it could be applied evenly, would represent a formidable reduction in supplies to countries whosedeliveries for some months have been running below requirements.13.   When it comes to applying the cut to, individual nations,many powerful reasons&apos; will be found for sparing some countries and the field will inevitably be narrowed.      The Treasury would wish, for example, on balance of payments grounds,  to avoidreducing sales to countries in the dollar group..     Countries suchas Belgium might well rank-for immunity on similar grounds.Some countries draw all their supplies c.i.f. while others wouldbe affected only marginally by a reduction.      Long,termcommercial connections of the Oil Companies with their subsidiaries,connections built up over a number of years, might be seriously damaged by a major curtailment of c.i.f. deliveries.      There isa danger that countries faced with a shortage of supplies would.&apos;impound for internal use British Companies stocks of fuel and gasoil laid down in bunkers.     Finally, although under the MarshallPlan we may -not &quot;be under a definite obligation to maintain our -proportion of European countries&apos;  oil requirements, a major cutduring the passage of the European Reconstruction Programmethrough Congress would undoubtedly make a most unfavourableimpression in Washington. - -II)..    The application of the cut therefore raises a complex of issues, political, economic and commercial, which will have tobe carefully examined in relation to bach of the countries nowsupplied on an c.i.f. basis.15.    If,  therefore,. it is decided that it is impracticable forthe Admiralty to make a larger contribution- it is immediate assistance that is so urgently needed - and that the deficit,after allowing for&quot;the reductions in United Kingdom and Commonwealthcivil consumption must be met out of foreign trade, we would propose to tell the companies thats-(a) their supplies to the United Kingdom and commonwealth countries and for bunkers must be maintained at the agreed levelafter giving effect to the reductions mentioned above,  and(b) any deficit of tanker tonnage must be taken out of c.&apos;i.f.trade with foreign countries.     We estimate that this will involve an overall out of c.i.f.  sales, of U0% (though thepercentage may not be the same for- the Shell and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Companies) and we would like them to revise their programmes of deliveries to particular countries and let ussee them to enable us to make any suggestions that seemed desirable in the national interest.&apos; . -k-
It must be overlooked that such a reduction in foreign trade may involve difficulties with, the Governments of thevarious countries concerned, and may also result in legal actionsagainst the British Oil Companies&quot; in foreign courts.     a direction by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Oil Companies tomeet the United Kingdom programme at .the expense of their foreign contracts would not be, any protection in-foreign courts and the Oil Companies may therefore&apos;ask for an indemnity.These matters will have to be considered when the revisedprogrammes are received from the Companies.16.    Summary  . &apos;As explained in paragraph k, it is anticipated that the.British Oil Companies total deficit will amount to 1,334,000 tons,The measures outlined in.this memorandum would reduce thisdeficit as followsAdditional[charteringUnitedKingdombmmonwealthadmiraltydidThousands&apos; of tons(a) Deliveries by additional dollar;:-tankers -. 120(b) Elimination of United KingdomStockbuilding 264(c) Temporary halt in coal/oil&apos;conversion schemes 40(d) Saving in gas oil by reducedmanufacture of carburettedwater gas - &apos; 30(e) Reduction of 5 per cent in british share of Dominion and Gommonwealthsupplies.

If a further five fast Admiralty tankers (making 20in all) were made available this would presumably reduceAdmiralty stocks by about another 80,000 tons (i.e. toabout 2^ million tons compared with about 2 million tons,at the beginning of 1947 and 2.4 million tons in November1947).      This would provide 135,000 tons of Oil and reducethe deficit to 380,000 tons: but a cut of about 30% Inc.i.f. sales to foreign countries would still be necessary.A. B.H.T.N.
