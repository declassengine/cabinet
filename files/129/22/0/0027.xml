It is important that these Officers should have enough background information to enable them todischarge their own functions intelligently, and to offer advice on matters within their province in time for it to be effective; and it is necessary for these reasonsthat they should be informed at once of some of the decisions of the Cabinet or its Committees and, on occasion, of progress in the formulation of policy bythe Cabinet or its Committees. Each Minister is, however, personally responsiblefor deciding how much of this information should be conveyed to his InformationOfficer; and it is preferable that the information should be imparted, with appropriate guidance, by the Minister himself.This instruction replaces paragraph 8 (6) of OP. (45) 100, and copies ofthat Paper should be noted accordingly.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,1st December, 1947.34596
