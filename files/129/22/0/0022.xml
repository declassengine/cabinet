THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP   HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. November 1947     ,&quot; .    secret Copy No.     32. Si;-&apos; usCP. (47) 3122Ath November, 1947CABINETFOOD prices memorandum by the Minister of food the background of the necessity to raise the prices of certain food-stuffs forthe purpose of holding the total expenditure on food subsidies in this financialyear and next within a ceiling of M 392 is as follows :-(a) The Chancellor in his Financial Statement on 15th April, 1947, estimated the total cost of food subsidies at M 392 this year. This total wasmade up of an estimate of M 365-5 on direct food subsidies charged to the Vote of my Department, M 18-3 in respect of acreage paymentsborne by the Agricultural Departments, and M 8-2 in respect of the fertiliser subsidy borne by the Board of Trade.(&amp;) The trading losses of the Ministry of Food result from the sale of certainfood-stuns at pegged prices below the cost of acquisition. It follows that any hardening of prices against the Ministry not foreseen in theestimates or any changes in the incidence of supplies from low cost to high cost sources have a direct effect on the estimates. In the first half of 1947-48 the effect of increased prices overseas, coupled withthe increased prices granted to home producers, drove the estimates of the subsidy which would be required up to a peak of M 430-8 inJuly. The estimate has since fallen as the result of increases in the retail prices of sugar and potatoes, reduced consumption following upon ration cuts, and the cessation of purchases from the comparativelyexpensive hard currency areas. At the end of October the cost for theyear was estimated at M 409, and there are indications that the totalcost might be further reduced to M 402.(c) The hardening of prices during 1947 has to some extent been cushioned bythe existence of stock purchased at lower pricey. During 1948-49 thefull effect&apos; of increased and increasing acquisition prices wilt be felt.Our present estimates show the cost of subsidies in that year at M 450.(d) In order to keep subsidies within the agreed ceiling of M 392 itwas necessary to provide savings of M l7 in 1947-48 andM 58 in 1948-49. Since the estimate for 1948-49 covers aperiod full of uncertainty and it would be too much to expect ourforecast to be entirely justified by events, it was thought prudent tobudget for somewhat larger savings. In future we shall be operating under a ceiling and prices generally are still hardening against us;these prudent reserves may forestall the necessity for further price increases in months to come.2.   As a consequence the following price increases were agreedEstimated to save in; . .   .  ; . . 1947-4$   1948-49From an average of Tp an average of  million.Bacon     ...

The estimated savings are based on weekly rations of 1 oz. of bacon, 2 oz.ofntea, Is. of meat and an annual ration of 66 shell eggs.The volume of savings in 1947-48 is dependent upon the dates from whichthe increases operate but the downward trend of our estimates for that year givesus some latitude.   A decision is nevertheless urgent.3. Excluding welfare foods and animal feeding-stuffs only twelve food-stupsare now subsidised by the Ministry of Food. These are listed in Appendix A.,which shows the amount of the subsidy for 1948-49 both by unit and in totaland compares the current retail prices with the prices at the outbreak \of war..The sayings could be achieved by making minor increases over a large part ofthe field or by concentrating major increases on a few selected items. The latter course was favoured both for technical reasons and for reasons given by theChancellor in his Financial Statement of 11th November. As a first step in theconsideration of this question, certain food-stuffs were eliminated for the following reasons: (a) Potatoes. The tonnage subsidy has recently been abolished and the smalltrading loss now remaining could be recovered only if the Ministrywere to take title to ail potatoes, or to surcharge the potato merchants.The acreage subsidy borne by the Agricultural Departments could he recovered only by one or other of these methods, both of whichwould consume man-power. ,(6) Bread and Flour. It was thought inadvisable to increase the price of-       bread at a time when potatoes fead just been rationed and increasediin price.   An increase in the flour price without a consequentialincrease in the ipriee of bread wOuld have forced the. baking subsidy-     i        up to a level which Would invite largeTseale fraud. The shaking subsidy- is paid -direct to bakers on the faith of claims rendered and it isadvantageous to maintain it .at a low figure to minimise fraud.: -(c) ^Sugari-r-The retail price was reduced from 4d. to 3d. per lb. in April1947 for Cost of Living Index purposes, but the price was increasedby 2d. per lb, from 9th November, 1947 A further increase immedi-ately following these two price changes is, in my view, politically*      inadvisable.i (id) MilJc-^-Uhe price of milk was increased by Id. per quart in June 1947,and a further increase in the price of this valuable food would, Ithink, be socially unwise.:    -(e) Margarine la-ndfCooMng-Fat- The subsidies are small and the savings-si \ - ,      . iresulting from (price increases would not be great.   Furthermore, to; the -extent that margarine replaces butter in the consumption of the. ;  - lower income groups, it might be inadvisable to raise the price of the1      one without at the same time raising the price of the other.(/) Butter and Cheese. Beth these commodities were redueedin price in the spring of 1947tbut.I feel there are more powerful arguments in favourtri: of increasing other prices, particularly since it is proposed to raise. the iprices of other livestock ^products, feaceta, eggs and meat.  More-1  - over, -&amp;ie -.pri6esTdf  otter -and cheese are in equi Minium and it would&apos; -be inadvisable to move one without the other.4. There :are strong arguments against reducing the subsidies on welfarefood and animal feeding-Stuns. Milk and other welfare foods are provided freeor at cheap prices to priority classes, and, as the Chancellor said in presentingMs Financial -Statement on 11th November, this subsidy is an integral and most valuable part of our social a(nd welfare services. To raise the price of animal$eediitg-stuffs would accomplish nothing, since it would provide the home producerwi^ valid grounds for claiming increased prices for his products, at the cost of either the Exchequer or the consumer.5. The arguments in favour of increasing the prices of the remaining fourfood-stuffs are : (a) Tea.-As long as the consumer is insulated from the effect of increased prices to the producers and export taxes imposed by the producing countries, the latter will continue to regard the British, market as safe.The removal of the subsidy might well cause the producers, and their governments, to doubt the wisdom of forcing up prices, and so mightwelDbring aboirt ^ reduction in the cost of tea.(6) Bacon. The current price is about 12 per cent, above the pre-war price and it is 4rf. per lb. lower than it was in May of this year.   Bacon
s::   costs have risen greatly ^ahd 4ke Subsidy is high in consequence.  Aslong as the ration remains at 1 oz. the effect on the individual. con-. sumer of removing the subsidy will be trifling. ,&quot;&apos;(c) Shell Eggs.-The pre-war price of shell eggs was 2s, per dozen on average, iwhile the current price is Is. 7\d.  This is the only commodity which; sells at a lower retail price than pre-war and the subsidy is in con-sequence an unusually heavy one.   The price of eggs was reducedby 3d. per dozen in April 1947, and the proposed increase of Is:: 3%:&apos;; per dozen would produce a price of 2s. 10^d. as compared with Is: iO^d.&apos;&quot; before April.  At 2s. lOfrf. eggs would still be heavily subsidised.   . .(d) Meat. The consumption,Of meat is high in total compared with the totalof other rations. A comparatively small increase in the price of meatcan therefore produce a large subsidy saving. The current price isvery little albdve the pre-war price. From any point of view thereforemeat is a good subject for a saving of the order required. The valueof the meat ration will, of course, have to be raised, but this presentsno difficulty.6. The average cost of the proposed increases to the consumer is just underId. per head per week. The increased cost of the weekly rations of non-priorityconsumers will be approximately : Meat. Increase of 2d. per lb. on Is. ration     ... ...      &apos;2Shell Eggs. Increase of l\d. on 66 eggs per year... 1^Tea. Increase of lOd.per lb. on 2 oz. ration 1^Bacon.  Increase of Is. per lb. on 1 oz. ration  ... ...       fThe remaining l^d. will come from priority classes, caterers, &amp;c.7. There are, of course, many alternative ways of effecting a saving of theorder required in a full year. Some of these are set-out at Appendix B. Theyhave been compiled on the assumption that there will be no further increases inthe prices of bread, flour, milk, potatoes and sugar.8. The alternative proposals 4n Appendix B show that a saving of the orderof M 7G would in any caste Involve quite considerable price increases in anumber of important food-stuffs. Administrative action in respect of the price increases agreed with the Chancellor is already well advanced. Departure fromthe agreed programme will cause delay and may therefore prevent us fromsucceeding in our announced intention of keeping the subsidy within the limit of M 392 in this financial year. Apart from this I have no strong viewson which particular food prices shall be increased. , Whichever foods we selectthe effect on the public Will be painful.Ministry of Food, S.W. 1,2^th November, 1947.
