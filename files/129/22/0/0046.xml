SECRET Copy No.CP. (47) 33617th December, 1947CABINETARMY AND AIR FORCE COURTS-MARTIAL COMMITTEE, 1946 :INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONSMemorandum by the Lord ChancellorMY colleagues will be aware that a Committee was appointed in 1948 underthe chairmanship of Mr. Justice Lewis by the Secretaries of State for War andfor Air to review, in the light of experience gained &apos;in the war and other considerations, the recommendations of the Army and Air Force Courts-martial committee, 1938 (the Oliver Committee, Omd. 6200) and kindred matters.2. This Committee has not yet reported, but Mr. Justice Lewis wrote tothe two Secretaries of State in April submitting a number of interim recommenda-tions, some for immediate implementation and others for approval in principle and adoption as soon as practicable.3. The main recommendation in the second category is in effect an endorse-ment of one made by the Oliver Committee (in paragraph 15 of their report)&quot;That the Judge Advocate-General should be appointed on the recommendationof and be responsible to some Minister other than the Secretary of State for war or Air.-&apos;4. Mr. Justice Lewis recalls that the Oliver Committee made this recommen-dation in view of the importance of removing in the mind of the public any impression that the Judge Advocate-General, whose duty it is, among other things,,to review all convictions of courts-martial and to advise the Secretaries of Statefor War and for Air on questions of law arising out of such review, is in any sense a subordinate official of the W&amp;r Office or the Air Ministry. The OliverCommittee were satisfied that the Judge Advocate-General, although appointed on the recommendation of the Secretaries of State for War and for Air, in factenjoyed in the discharge of his duties complete independence, but they considered it most desirable that steps should be taken to remove any possible misunder-standing on this pointy5r The Lewis committee proposed has reached the same conclusion and for the same reason recommends that in future the Judge Advocate-General should be appointed on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor and should be responsible to him.In relation to the Secretaries of State for War and for Air the duties of the judge Advocate-General would continue to be advisory in character and while no doubt there would be few occasions upon which such advice would not beaccepted and acted upon, no invariable rule to this effect should, in the Committee&apos;view, be prescribed. The ultimate responsibility in the matter should be leftwhere it is at present, namely, with the&apos; Secretaries of State.6. The Lewis Committee has also endorsed another recommendation of theOliver Committee that the Judge Advocate-General should be relieved of theresponsibility for the functions at present carried out by his Military and AirForce Departments, i.e., what may be briefly described as the prosecuting sideof the Judge Advocate-General&apos;s work. Under this recommendation the Militaryand Air Force Departments would become directorates pr branches of the WarOffice and Air Ministry.34679Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1947
7. Consequently, in future the Judge Advocate-General would be responsibleonly for the work at present undertaken by him and his Judicial Department.His main functions would thus be: the superintendence of the administrationof military and air force law in the Army and Royal Air Force respectively,including the provision of Deputies and legal staffs with the principal Armyand Air Force Commands abroad; pursuant to his Letters Patent, theprovision&apos; and appointment of Judge Advocates at trials by court-martialand military courts held in the United Kingdom and abroad; the reviewof the proceedings of. courts-martial and of military courts held pursuant to Royal -Warrant (prisoners of war and war criminals) with a viewto seeing whether they have been regular and legal, including the tendering of legal advice on confirmation or review or on petition; in the event of it being necessary to quash the proceedings, the making of recommendations to the appro-priate Secretary of State or Commander-in-Chief with this object; the custody of the proceedings of all courts-martial and military courts as aforesaid; assistanceto each Secretary of State in the formulation of any advice it may be necessaryto give the Sovereign regarding the proceedings of courts-martial and of military courts for the trial of prisoners of war. ,8. Further, in his capacity as Legal Adviser to the Secretaries of State forWar and for Air, his function would be to. give advice on other legal questions affecting the Army and Royal Air Force as they may from time to time require.9. The Secretaries of State for War and for Air and I have consideredthese recommendations and are agreed that they should be accepted in principle and put into force as soon as practicable, but as the Committee recognises, thereare substantial reasons&apos; which make an immediate reconstitution of the judge advocate-General&apos;s Office difficult and in any case a good deal of preparatory work will be necessary to put it into effect. We have agreed that it is desirableto set up a Committee forthwith to work out the details and I have asked sir Albert Napier of my Department to put this in train at once.10. The parallel Oliver Committee recommendations were approved inprinciple by the Cabinet of the day in 1939, but action was deferred owing tothe war. We have thought it proper in the circumstances, and in view of theconstitutional importance of the question, to bring the matter before our colleagues.11. It is of course possible that the Final Report of the Lewis Committee,when received, will include recommendations which, if approved, will involve further fundamental alterations in the constitution of the Judge Advocate-.General&apos;s Office and in his status and responsibilities, but it is not anticipatedthat they will affect the principle of the interim recommendations already made,which are dealt with in this paper. ,12. I ask the Cabinet to agree that the following recommendations shouldbe accepted in principle and put into force as soon as practicable : (a) that in future the Judge Advocate-General should be appointed on therecommendation of, and should be responsible to, the Lord Chancellor,although the responsibility for acting or not acting on the judge advocate-General&apos;s advice in any particular case should remain withthe Secretary of State concerned;(b) that the Judge Advocate-General should be relieved of the responsibilityfor the pre-trial and prosecuting functions now carried out by his military and Air Force Departments;(c) that in future the Judge Advocate-General&apos;s functions should be confined to those described in paragraphs 7 and 8 above.&apos; ;.&quot;;:&apos;-&apos;./v-     :--.:v- -     \        -: - ;  j.House of Lords, S. W. 1,17th December, 1947.
