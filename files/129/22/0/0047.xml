Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1947SECRET Copy No.CP. (47) 33722nd December, 1947CABINETHOUSE OF LORDSMemorandum by the Lord Privy SealFrom what I hear of the attitude of some members of the Opposition in theHouse of Lords, it appears, that it might be possible to avoid a conflict on the parliament Bill.Also I think the other Parties in the House would desire to take advantageof the occasion to effect some sensible reform of the House.2. No issue has yet arisen on the first point, but it would certainly be useful to give consideration beforehand to the second.3. So far as I know, there is no defined disposition in the Labour Party tohave Single-Chamber Government. If this is correct, it is right to consider(i) whether it would be preferable to allow the present disorderly and possiblymenacing conditions to persist; or (ii) whether, provided agreement can be reached,there should be some satisfactory reform of the existing Chamber; or (iii) whether we should seek to replace it by a Second Chamber on some form of elected basis.4. For my part, I think the best line of approach would be to define theconditions we should attach in any case to a reform of the existing second chamber.On this I would suggest that the following conditions are essential from our point of view : (i) The powers of the Second Chamber should not exceed those provided forin the Bill now before Parliament, or in any agreed amendments,thereto;(ii) There should be power to create Life Peers;(iii) The hereditary right to attend and vote should be abolished;(iv) The members of a reformed Second Chamber should be paid a reasonablesalary so as to make membership open to suitable people with no private means; and(v) No conditions would be acceptable by which a permanent majority would.be assured for any political Party;5. Appendix I contains first suggestions which occur to me on the mannerin which the House might be reconstituted in conformitywith the conditions laiddown in the immediately preceding paragraph.! 6. If we are disposed to agree the above-mentioned conditions as essential in any case (or any others that might be suggested), the next step perhaps mightbe to discuss them, in confidence with a Party meeting.7. I circulate this paper and the further notes appended because it does not seem to me to be sensible that any conversation should be entered into with othersunless we ourselves are clear beforehand as to governing conditions., ,&apos;  .    , .       . . A.House of Lords, S. W.1,22nd December, 1947.3134681244
APPENDIX IComposition of the House and Proposals relating thereto1. At present the right to attend and vote is dependent on the Peer beingentitled to receive a writ of summons. All who are Peers of the United Kingdom(which has been the case for all creations since 1801) and 1.6 RepresentativeScottish Peers are entitled to receive a writ of summons.This right is also shared by sons or grandsons in the male line of the sovereign, by certain Bishops and by the Law Lords.2. The simplest method, therefore, of affecting the constitution of thepresent House would be to provide by an Act of Parliament that a writ ofsummons to attend and sit and vote shall not be issued to a Peer unless he possessesone or more of the qualifications set out in the Schedule of the Act, or is a LifePeer within the meaning of the Act.In this connection it is material to point out that the present business ofthe House is almost entirely run by those who have been appointed Peers during their own lifetime. This applies to the whole of the Government Front Bench,except Lord Listowel, and to the whole of the Opposition Front Bench.It is also the case, with very few exceptions, that Peers attending the Houseregularly possess one or other of the qualifications which could fairly be required,and the line of least resistance might well be to include ekisting Peers who have themselves been so created as entitled to receive a, writ of summons.3. I suggest that the following might be the ingredients in a Schedule which provided for the right to receive a writ of summons : (1) Life Peers who are appointed because of personal distinction or publicservice;(2) A Peer who was of the first Creation at the time of the passing ofthe Act;(3) A Peer who has held office under the Ministers of the Grown Act;(4) A Peer who has been a member of the House of Commons for, say, fouryears;(5) A Peer who is a Privy Councillor;(6) Peers who have held specially high offices, such as Viceroy, Governors,Lord Chairman, Speaker of the House of Commons, Chairman of ways,and Means of the House, and those who have held high office in the Foreign or Civil Service.A careful analysis of the existing House (see Appendix II) reveals the factthat nearly all the Peers in group (2) above possess one or other of the qualifica-tions required in groups (3) to (6).4. There are some other points, although not numerically of importance,that would require to be considered : (i) Under the existing law, sons or grandsons in the male line of the sovereign are entitled to receive a writ of summons, as are certainOfficers of State such as the Lord Great Chamberlain, the lord chamberlain and the Earl Marshal, as well as certain Bishops andthe Law Lords;(ii) With regard to the Bishops, the two Archbishops and the Bishops ofLondon, Winchester and Durham are entitled to sit because of theiroffice, A number of other Bishops (21 in all) sit in the order ofseniority,(iii) Another matter that would require decision would be the position of scottish Representative Peers, in accordance with the provisions ofthe Act of Union, 1707.(iv) There are still remaining 7 Irish Representative Peers who sit underthe Act of Union, 1801, for their own lives but who will not be replacedas there is no further provision for the election of Irish RepresentativePeers.*5. (i) I do not think that there would be anything gained by altering theentitlement of the male heirs of the Sovereign.(ii) The Law Lords sit for life only and might therefore come under thefirst of the groups indicated in paragraph 3 above.
(iii) With regard to the Bishops representing the Established Church Iwould suggest that the number be limited to the five who are specially entitledto attend. In this connection it may be suggested that if&quot; we continue represen-tation of the Established Church we should need to provide for the representationof the Free Churches, the Presbyterian Church and the Roman Catholic Church.I think myself that the line of least resistance would be not to open the door anywider, but to limit it to the five permanent representatives of the existingEstablished Church.(iv) With regard to the election of Scottish Representative Peers, if the rightto receive a writ of summons were limited as provided for in the above Schedule,this right would be done away with and the Act of Union amended accordingly.If it was felt desirable to continue the right of Scottish Peers to appoint repre-sentatives the same might have to be granted to a limited number of UnitedKingdom hereditary Peers. For my part I should be reluctant to include either of these, as of right, and I may say that in some proposals submitted to meprivately two years ago by the late Marquis of Salisbury the hereditary rightwas abandoned altogether and neither of these groups was mentioned.It is true that there are a few both of Scottish Peers and United KingdomPeers who at present are diligent and useful members of the House but mightnot possess any of the qualifications mentioned in groups (3) to (6), paragraph 3.If thought desirable in special cases, provision could be, made for them byappointing them Life Peers of Parliament. None of these, except possiblyRothschild and HoldeiL are members of the Labour Party.(v) With regard to the remainder of the Irish Peers I suggest that theyshould be treated on the same basis as existing United Kingdom Peers.6. If regard is had to the Summary of the numbers of the House, as shownin Appendix II, of the Peers who would be qualified under the conditionsproposed, it will be seen that the total is.248.If we consider,(1) the numbers of Peers who are needed for service on Private Bill andother Committees upstairs, and in other ways apart from the ordinaryattendance upon the Public Business of the House, and(2) the inevitable seniority in age of a House mainly composed of members appointed upon their records of achievement in public life,it is likely that a total membership of, say, 350 may be contemplated. If thisis so, there is room for the creation of a sufficient number of Life Peers.7. In conclusion it should be noted that, if the principle advocated in this paper is adopted and the hereditary right to receive a writ of summons disappears,the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, 1919, will presumably apply.APPENDIX note showing the number of Peers in the present House of Lords at 1st December,1947, qualified under the conditions proposed in paragraph 3 of Appendix first Creation         ...       ...      ...       ... ... 195Former Ministers    ...      ...      ...      ... ... 25Viceroys, &amp;c.          ...      ...       ..      .... ... 4Privy Council lors     ...       ...       ...       ... ... 8Former Members of Parliament     ...      ... ... 13Admirals of the Fleet       ...      ...      ... ...

They appear only once in the table,though they may satisfy several of the conditions.
