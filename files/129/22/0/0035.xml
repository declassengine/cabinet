i   176(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY......0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO,C.P.(U7) 5259th December,  19U7.CABINETWHITE FISH industry memorandum by the Minister of FoodWhen the Lord Presidents Committee accepted, on12th August (L.P. (1+7) 25th Meeting, Minute 3),  the majorityrecommendations of a sub-committee on the future of.theWhite Pish Industry (L.P.(U7) 129), from which I dissented,it was left open to me to bring the matter before theCabinet.      I do so now because I feel that the Cabinet should review the matter before a decision is   taken to introduce a Bill for the re-organisation of the white fish industry on the lines proposed by the Fisheries Ministers.2. My objections to these proposals, which I haveexpressed in a number of papers to the Lord presidents committee,  are of two kinds..3* First,  I have a general objection to this type of proposal for the &quot;re-organisation&quot;  of an industry while leaving the ownership of that industry in private hands.      Ibelieve that if we attempt to &quot;re-organise&quot; all industries by a system of detailed regulation and control, we shall get into serious trouble. &apos;    Instead we should steadily pursue our policy of nationalising one by one the basic industries ofthe country, while leaving at least the detailed operation ofthe still privately owned industry open to the forces of competition and the price mechanism.      As I submit below thereal effect of any policy of general control by &quot;Producer;Boords&quot; will be, not an advance towards socialism, but on the&quot;contrary the creation of a system of privately ownedmonopolies with a strong bias towards restrictive practices,operating under the protection of our own statutes.      I am convinced that such, a policy is a recipe for making commoditiesscarce and dear to the ultimate consumer.     When one of these commodities is a foodstuff - in&apos; this case fish,  the ,sole       - ;remaining major unrationed foodstuff - this prospect naturallyfills,me with alarm.4* . Again, it seems to me most doubtful whether, froman. administrative point of view, we are wise to choose this moment to add a large new field to our administrativeresponsibilities.     The proposals asj;hey have&quot; finally emerged from the sub-committee of the Lord Presidents Committee,  are for the setting up of not one, but two large new boards,  one on the producers&apos;  and the other on the distributive side ofthe industry.      Is this the moment to make this major increasein our national administrative overhead?      Is this the moment for our already hard pressed Government machine to assume theselarge new tasks?      Their assumption is, in my view totally
unnecessary.      For here at any rate is one industry which isprosperous, which is running on the whole pretty successfullyon its own,  where supply is somewhere near demand at current prices,  and where large returns are being realised &quot;by boththe employers and the employees - they are in many cases thesame persons working on a co-operative basis.      Ought we notto be thankful that in this cose we can leave comparatively wellalone for a few years at any rate?.5. My second objection to the Fisheries Ministers&apos;proposals is that this particular scheme for the re-organisationof an industry will inevitably hove restrictionist consequence;.;.6. I endorse the view of the Minister of Health thatany Production Board,  however good its intentions, would bein a hopeless position unless it submitted to the wishes of the producers;:   and it is the tendency of producers to restrictsupplies to the amount which can. be handled and sold with theleast inconvenience.      Without competition,  this is normallythe smallest quantity that will maintain existing returns atmaximum prices.7. Under the proposed scheme,  the Production board would have control not only of home-caught fish but also ofimports-      So no competition from this source could be broughtto the help of the consumer, .and fish supply policy would be entirely in the. hands of the Production Board.      In thesecircumstances &quot;it is. difficult to see what useful function theMinistry of Food and the Distribution Board could perform.Any reduction in distributive costs would be negligible comparedwith the level of first hand prices based on restricted supplies.Distribution costs are at present about 100%.      The housewifepays, that is to say,  about double the price realised by thefisherman on first sale.      Considering the highly perishable,seasonal,&apos; diverse and generally difficult character of fish asan object for distribution,  this compares very favourably withthe distribution costs of many.far easier commodities, such as-wireless sets or motor cars.      It is,. I am afraid,  a completeillusion to think that there is any large saving to be quicklymade in this distributive field. .  . 1 do not consider, therefore,that a Distribution Board is necessary or could bring, any important advantages.8. The ultimate solution is, in my opinion,  the nationalisation of.the wholesaling function;    we cannot, I take it,  do this in&apos;the present Parliament.      But this does not mean that nothing can be done.      In L.P. (h7) 133*  I have suggestedcertain immediate measures,  amounting to the setting up of a&quot;Fish Executive&quot; analogous to the &quot;Vegetable Executive&quot; whichhas just been created.9. If the proposed Distribution Board would be of little value, the proposed Production Board would inevitably be actively harmful.      However admirable were its plans it wouldbe sure to become restrictionist in practice.      The onlyexperience which we have in regard to the activities of Boardsappointed by the Fisheries Departments in this field is thatof the Herring Industry Board. -    This experience is notencouraging to &quot;the view that such Boards will abstain fromrestrictionist practices.      The Herring Industry Board imposedrestrictions, on, fishing on every day in June this year but two,and for about half trie month only half, the fleet was allowed tofish. .    As a result,  except in the first ten days or so of the season, which began on 1&apos;0th May,  and except for a small quantity
on.10th July, no herrings were    purchased for oil and meal atthe Moray Firth ports in spite of the offer to &quot;buy the wholesurplus subject to the capacity of the factories.      This degreeof restriction has arisen from the fact that the Board enteredinto an understanding with the Moray Firth herring,fishermenthat the Board would restrict their fishing to what it estimate,,,would produce catches just sufficient to satisfy the fresh,kippering and export markets without producing any herrings for.the, to my mind, vital purpose of producing oil for margarineand meal for animal feedingstuffs.      This understanding and the highly restrictionist policy which has resulted from it,  has,in fact, meant that only very small quantities of herrings havebeen available for reduction for margarine oil and feedingstuffs.10.,&apos; In the latter part of this year,  owing to strong representations by my Department,  the Herring Industry Board1spolicy has become .somewhat less restrictionist.11. I need not emphasise to the Cabinet the consequences which would ensue if we do allow the white fishing industryos well as the herring Industry to be put in the hands of aBoard,  the inevitable bias of which will be to restrict its activities and so to maintain the price of its produce at thehighest possible level.      The result will inevitably be,  as I suggested in L.P.(U&amp;) 28k,  &quot;o small,  cosy,  highly protected,     0-enormously profitable fishing industry which has excludedcompetitive new entrants.      By so doing,  it would prevent usever achieving an ample supply of cheap fish to the working classof this country - which should surely be the object of the wholebusiness&quot;.12. Confirmation that the bias would be restrictionist,can be found in the Fisheries Ministers&apos;  original proposals contained in L.P.(k.6) 283.      I point out this restrictionistbias in the note appended to my L.P.&apos;(k6) 28k.      It will- &quot;be seenthat the Fisheries.Ministers&apos; first proposal is that the FishProduction Board should &quot;drastically reduce the number of trawlerowners&quot;, with the obvious intention of reducing competitivepressure in the actual catching of fish.   . A statutory monopoly of the right to fish is.thus to be given to certain selectedtrawler owners, thus excluding newcomers and small men from theindustry.      (See also paragraph 3 of my note,  pointing out thebias . against the modern efficient Hull trawler woners because etheir activities tended to reduce&apos;the price of fish;    also paragraph k as to the,  in my view,  totally unnecessary charge of 11 million which is to fall on the Treasury as an assistance for re-equipping the fishing fleet).13* I believe that&apos;the Fisheries Ministers are stillinfluenced by the experience of the inter-war years when demandfor fish constantly fell below supply with,  admittedly, mostpainful consequences to the industry.      They have failed to take into account fundamental changes in the situation.      In thefirst place, other foods are much less plentiful and cheap, andwill, unfortunately,  certainly remain so for many years to come.This in itself; will greatly increase the demand for fish.      but still more important than this factor is the re-distribution of income which we have brought about.      This means that the totalmoney demand for foodstuffs in general and fish in particularpossessed by the population is- how far larger than ever before.This demand will provide a market of such a size that the fishing industry can work for it without fear of glut.
Hi&apos;.1 This yearns experience is particularly interestingin this connection.      On 14-th March of this year the FisheriesMinistries (see L.P.(47) 51, Appendix,  page 4, column 6),  said&quot;we feel that the Ministry of Food is too optimistic inanticipating a shortage of fish relative to demand&quot;.      this phrase reveals clearly the general attitude of the Ministries,in which they consider that a shortage of fish relative to demand is something to be hoped for.      It fully confirms,  I. submit,-my view that their bias is and will inevitably remain restrictionist.But, in addition,  it reveals what has proved in the event to bea mistaken forecast of the supply and demand situation through1947.      In spite of leaving the white fish (as opposed to the herring) industry free of restrictionist pressure,  there has been no glut whatever of fish.      On the contrary,  prices have been-at or about the maximum throughout the season and we have actuallyhad to raise some fish prices this autumn.      I am confident thatthe fear of a new and -ruinous glut of fish which is the realreason behind the present proposals, is based on an equallyfallacious forecast of the situation in 1948 and subsequent years.recommendations i therefore recommend:-(1)      that we do not proceed with plans to introduce ^legislation for the re-organisation of the white fish industry;(2)      that instead we set up a Fish Executive on the linesof the recently created inter-departmental Vegetable Executivefor the purpose of carrying out the immediate proposals sketchedin my L.P.(47) 133;(3)      that as a possible part of our programme put -&quot;before&apos;the Electorate in the next Election, and to be carried out inthe next Parliament, we should prepare, detailed plans for the nationalisation of the fish wholesaling function.      For .1 would agree that it is possible,  though by no means certain,  that manyyears hence the conditions of over supply relative to demandmight re-appear in this - industry,  and that there would then be agreat advantage in controlling the situation by a public monopol;.of wholesale distribution.J. S.Ministry of Food, S.W. 1.9th December,  1947.
