S. OTreasury Chambers, S.W. 1,10th December, 1947.FORTNIGHTLY ECONOMIC report .-Man-Power- The Ministry of Labour figures on the distribution of man-power in Octoberwill be available at the end of this week. Preliminary estimates for Octobershow a further increase in employment in the &quot;under-manned industries.&quot; Thenumbers employed in cotton spinning had reached 96,000 by the last week ofNovember their highest level since the end of the war.*II. ProductionCoal &apos;2. The latest weekly figures of coal output are encouraging. In each week in November output of deep-mined coal exceeded the Prime Ministers target of4 million tons. Output is, however, seasonally high in the autumn and it is too early to know whether this higher output will be maintained.3. The number of men on the colliery books has risen slightly to 715,500.The improvement in output in November was due to an increase in shifts workedand to a higher output per man shift. At 1 12 tons per man shift overall, this rate was only slightly less than the average achieved during 1938. ;4. Total distributed stocks of coal continue to rise, although stocks heldby electricity undertakings have now begun to show a seasonal declineSt,eel &apos; &apos; . &apos;5. The figures for the weeks of November so far available show that production-tion of ingots and castings was slightly less than in October. Stocks of pig-ironand $crap continue to fall and a further decline is expected in December and January.34655 b
Cotton Yarn6. Output rose between September and October from 12-94 to 14-40 mil) ionlbs. a week.   In the week ended 22nd November it was 14-66 million lbs.II(I. Transport7. The number of locomotives produced rose from 58 in September to76 in October and output of new railway wagons also increased. Of the 76locomotives in October, however, 41 were for export and about one-quarter ofthe wagons were also for shipment abroad.8. Although the stock of wagons continues to decline, the number under or awaiting repair has been reduced even more and the number available foruse has therefore risen.9. Because of increased coal output the number of loaded wagons forwardedcontinues to rise. The average turn-round time for wagons in the week ending28th November was 9-3 days compared with 9-7 days in November last year.IY. Balance of Payments10. The latest export figure available is still that for October when exports were 20 per cent, by volume greater than in 1938.11. Detailed figures now available for October show that the balance ofimports and exports with Western Hemisphere countries (United States, Canada,Central and South America) is still very adverse, though less so than in September.&quot;With countries in the sterling area imports and exports are broadly equal, andwith other countries (other than the Western Hemisphere) a favourable balancewas achieved, in October due to a reduction in imports and an increase in exports.12. Permission has now been secured to draw on the; unused amount of our line of Credit with the United States Government. During November therewas a further fall in our gold and dollar reserves : AprilMayJuneJulyTheDrain on Reserves^) -*.^7 ,   million77-583-481-0m in \     ... ...      ... ...      ...      ... 133 * 5August... ...      ... ... 155-4September .......     ...      ...... &apos;   92 -8(2)October ...... ...      ... 67-1(2)November ...   1 ... ...      ...      ... 58-7f)(&apos;) The 1948 target is an average of  25 million a month.(*) Including drawings of  14-9,  29-8 and  14-9 million from the International monetary fund.Y. Prices13. The index number of export prices (1938 = 100) rose from 236 in Septem-ber to 237 in October. Import prices also rose from 254 to 256 over the sameperiod. Discussions in the United States about the Marshall Aid programme havecoincided with a further increase in American wheat prices. In NovemberAmerican wheat prices rose above $3 a bushel a rise of 50 per cent, since ayear ago.YI. Wages and Earnings14. The Ministry of Labour index of weekly wage rates rose in october to 70 per cent, higher than in September 1939- The earnings enquiry takenin April 1947 has now been published. Earnings for adult men in April were79 per cent, greater than in October 1938, and earnings of women (18 and over)107 per cent, higher.15. Table 10 shows that in some, but not in all, under-manned industries,hourly earnings have risen more than the average for all manufacturing industries.In some cases, particularly in textiles, this movement has been from a low pre-war level.&apos;&apos;-     &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;&apos;/&apos;.&apos;\&apos;.&quot;&apos;9^ December, 1947.
