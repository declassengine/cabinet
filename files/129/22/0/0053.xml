On my return the Foreign Secretary invited me to recordmy impressions and at his suggestion I am now circulating my notes for theinformation of my colleagues.L  S.Ministry of Town and Country Planning, S.W. 1,- 31st December, 1947.IMPRESSIONS OF A RECENT VISIT TO POLAND ANDCZECHOSLOVAKIAI visited Poland and Czechoslovakia on the invitation and as the guest ofthe respective Governments, for the purpose of studying the plans for physicalreconstruction and discussing their proposals.PolandIn Poland we were a party of seven, consisting of representatives of myDepartment and of the more important blitzed cities. In Czechoslovakia I wasalone.We spent about twelve days in Poland, during which time we visited Warsaw,Breslau, Katowice, CracOw, Danzig and Gdynia, and a number of villages, andwe saw a good deal of the country.We were received \with  the utmost courtesy, hospitality and friendliness, andthe visit was a complete success. We learned a good deal about the problems of reconstruction, both physical and economic, and we were able to make many usefulsuggestions to them based on our own experience. Some of their ideas on ruralplanning are interesting and novel. On the whole, we are far in advance ofPoland in town and country planning, and the Town and Country planning act, 1947, is much more revolutionary in its method of dealing with land problemsthan anything that has happened in Poland. Polish planners definitely recogniseour superiority and look to us to give them a lead. .  -The basis of the invitation to my party and to myself was that there wouldbe a return visit of Polish planners in the near future, and, after discussion withthe Foreign Secretary, I extended .a definite invitation to. the Minister of reconstruction to bring a party of planners to this country in the early spring of 1948. * This invitation was gratefully accepted.Although the period of our stay in the country was short, we were affordedexceptional opportunities of studying the life of the people and their, problems,34723 n
and I had a number of talks with the President of the Republic, M. Bierut, thePrime Minister, M. Cyrankiewicz, the Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and a number of other Ministers. We were also afforded the opportunityof discussion with representatives of all sections of society, including provincialgovernors, heads of towns, Government and local government officials, farmers and peasants, persons engaged in the building industry and many others. As aresult my colleagues may be interested in a short statement of my impressions.Devastation and ReconstructionThe devastation caused throughout Poland, including the new territories, isalmost indescribable, and is probably worse than anywhere else in the world.Warsaw is stated to have had 90 per cent, of its buildings destroyed. A numberof other large towns have suffered damage to the extent of 40 per cent., 50 per cent,and 60 per cent. Whole villages have been practically wiped out. Even to-daymany roads are impassable. Hundreds of bridges and railways have been destroyed, there are still thousands of enemy tanks, guns and vehicles to be seen by the roadside; in some places as much as 25 per cent, of the land is uncultivatedand often whole areas are derelict for miles on end. Superimposed upon thetask of revitalising these areas is the problem of the transference of millions of people from the eastern territories &quot; ceded &quot; to Russia to the new territories inthe west acquired from Germany. It would be difficult enough if families werebeing transferred to an area where houses, farms and all the other necessaries of life were available, but in devastated territories it is a task which defies imagina-tion. Nevertheless, a new life is somehow being created It is an astonishingthing to go through a town like Breslau, from which all Germans have been evacuated, and to find that no single inhabitant has lived in the town for morethan about two years, and the same applies to practically the whole of Upper and lower Silesia. The people with whom we spoke regard themselves as pioneersand are full of the thrill and excitement of creating what amounts to a newcivilisation. There are relatively few Germans left in the new territories andthese are mostly key workers, in mines, or those engaged in indispensable tasksfor the time being, but it is the desire of the Poles to expatriate every singleGerman at the earliest possible moment.In spite of the stupendous efforts made by the Polish people in the reconstruc-tion of Warsaw and the vast improvement that has taken place since the end ofthe war, the reconstruction of the town appears an almost superhuman task.Nevertheless, the work of reconstruction is being carried out with tremendous zealand enthusiasm. There appears to be a very clear understanding of the taskamong all sections of the community and a determination to work as hard aspossible to restore their country at the earliest moment. We saw no evidence ofslacking anywhere. The feeling of optimism is universal. The Poles have a territory which, when fully developed, is rich in resources, a hard-working population and an increasing birth-rate, and there is no doubt that if Poland can rely upon a long period of peace they may well become in a generation or so a greatforce in Europe. .Internal conditions at present the standard of life is low. Food is relatively plentiful, but theprice of clothing is very high, and shoes are prohibitive. I saw many people,both in the towns and in the country, walking about barefooted, or in canvas shoeswhich are quite inadequate for protection against the weather.Naturally housing conditions are.very bad indeed, but there are signs ofbuilding activity everywhere, in the construction of houses, factories, and schools,and the repair of roads, bridges and railways. The shortage of plant and equip-ment is, however, a serious handicap. A few bulldozers or scrapers, or other types of mechanical aid would be of immense value to&quot; them. Everywhere we went wewere told &quot; if only we had a little more plant and equipment we could dowonder?., we have to do everything with our bare hands.&quot;Having regard, to all that the Poles have gone through since 1939 it is not surprising that there is a considerable amount of Jl-health. Unfortunatelyinfantile mortality is very high, the incidence of T.B. in the large towns, particu-larly among children, is most distressing, and the health services are quite inadequate. .I saw no evidence of domination by the U.S.S.R. I believe the Polish peoplepassionately desire independence, and have a much livelier historic sense than,most nations.   I do not believe that the traditional antagonism towards Russia
is entirely dead. The various parties forming the Government, whether Com-munist or otherwise, definitely put country first.They naturally talked with me a good deal, both about their internal politicalsituation, their relationship with us, and their attitude towards Germany. Sofar as I could gather the Communists and the Social Democrats are workingharmoniously together. Certainly at the Ministry of Reconstruction, where theMinister himself is a Social Democrat, and of his two deputies one is a Com-munist and the other a member of the Social Democrat Party, the relationshipappeared to be quite cordial, and the same applied to other Ministries. Locallythe same position obtains. A Communist head of a province will have as a deputy a member of the Social Democrat Party, and vice, versa. Although inordinary conversation people were sometimes quite outspoken in criticism of theGovernment, I met nobody who admitted to being a member of any opposition party.Attitude to Foreign PowersDuring my 12 days&apos; stay in Poland I listened to, and made, many scoresof speeches. Without exception there was an intense desire for our friendship.Whatever we may think about ourselves the Polish people still regard us as agreat nation, and look up to us as capable of giving them a lead in many directions.I made it my business in the course of my speeches to dwell upon our strong feelings of sympathy and affection for the Polish people, and our desire for theirfriendship, but I also made a point of emphasising what we were doing here inthe way of reconstruction, and the silent revolution that was taking place in our approach to our own economic and social problems. I particularly stressed that,though we were not shouting about the immense progress we were making inreconstruction, our own achievements in that direction were by no meansinconsiderable.In my discussions with the President, the Prime Minister, and others, certaintopics constantly recurred.   They were : (a) The feeling of uncertainty about their Western frontiers, and their regret that we had not given them greater assurances as to their frontiersthan they actually have. I made no comment on the views put forward,but I am sure that if it were possible to be a little more forthcomingabout these frontiers, even while recognising that they are ultimatelya matter to be settled in the Peace Treaty with Germany, it wouldhave a good effect. In any event there is no method, short of war, of removing them from any part of the former German territories.(6) Their sincere and strong regret at the deterioration of our relations withthe Soviet Union. They constantly made the point that together we and the Soviet Union could guarantee the peace of Europe despite theUnited States of America.(c)&apos; Their fear of a German revival. Their country has been devastated twicein one generation, and they are fearful of a revived Germany once more attacking them.In this latter connection they are strongly critical of the &quot;Marshall &quot; pro-posals, which they believe have for their object the building up of german industry, and the strengthening of Germany in relation to themselves. People ofall sections of society say&quot; if there is any help going, why not give it to nationslike ourselves rather than to Germany.&quot; They are mistrustful of the &quot; Marshall &quot;proposals because of the conditions which they think the Americans are likelyto impose on any assistance they may give. Incidentally, the attitude to theUnited States was unfriendly. I made it my business to discuss the problemof Germany very frankly with the Poles, and on one occasion I actually addressed a: gathering of officials who were accompanying us on our tour, and dealt withtheir questions. They agreed unanimously that they had no desire to exterminatethe Germans, not even by methods of slow starvation, and they, therefore, were compelled to recognise that if Germany was not to be allowed to die of starvationshe had to be provided with facilities&apos; to enable her to stand on her own feet. Theywere then driven to argue that the standard of living in Germany ought to be nohigher than their own, and, they conceded that to ensure this it was necessary to fix by international agreement what was the appropriate amount of industrialdevelopment which should be permitted, and not to refuse to allow any develop-ment at all as they were at first inclined to argue. I gained the impression thatthere was a good deal of confusion in the minds of the Polish people, including34723 b 2
even many of those in very high quarters, upon this issue, and some frank talksmight be of advantage.I would like to conclude these impressions on Poland by stressing three points :  (i) It would be advantageous if possible to give Poland some assurance about her frontiers.(ii) A certain amount of practical help in the way of a supply of equipment for reconstruction, even if only of a token character, would be ofimmense psychological value in the furtherance of our relations with poland.(iii) The advantage of closer contact at all levels, cultural and otherwise,and of frank discussion of our mutual problems.CzechoslovakiaDuring my 8 days&apos; stay in this country I visited Slovakia, Moravia andBohemia. I was not able to visit the Sudetenland, but otherwise covered a very wide area in my travels.Reconstruction and DevastationThere has been very much less destruction in Czechoslovakia than in Poland,although in patches, particularly where fighting has taken place, it is severe.Czechoslovakia has similar problems to Poland as regards the repopulation of theSudetenland, which has been almost entirely cleared of Germans. Fortunatelyfor her a large part of this country has been left intact, and she has not inaddition the problem of rebuilding. A great deal of reconstruction is takingplace, and the forthcoming three-years&apos; plan provides for an immense amountof additional work. I am inclined to think that the Czechs are undertaking too much, and that the task will be found to be beyond their capacity. I discussed this freely with a number of Ministers, who all privately agreed with me.Internal ConditionsOutwardly the standard of living is better than in Poland; housing conditions are certainly better, and although the Czechs are paying great attentionto the building of hospitals and health centres, the infantile mortality rates arevery high, and there is a good deal of ill health.There has been a considerable measure of nationalisation; I was told that60 per cent, of the industries in Czechoslovakia are now State owned, and thatall parties, including the Democrats, are in favour of nationalisation, thoughthe latter would prefer to move more slowly.I was very interested to ascertain during my stay in Slovakia whether therewas a strong feeling there in favour of independence, and I discussed this witha great many people I met. My conclusion is that the desire for independence in Slovakia is not stronger than in Scotland, that there is a great deal of talk about it, but when it comes to the point neither country would be capable of standing on its own feet.I was amazed at the almost touching gratitude expressed by all classes inthis country for the hospitality we accorded to the Czechs during the war. Thewelcome which I received, particularly in the villages which I visited, made mefeel very humble; in some cases the streets were decorated with banners andBritish flags. The whole village or small town turned out usually in nativecostume to welcome me, and I was received with their traditional form of greeting,bread and salt and, of course, the Czech spirits, Slivovicz. Usually, also, I wasgiven presents which in the aggregate became somewhat embarrassing.I formed the impression that there was more Soviet domination here thanin Poland. In several of the Ministries I visited I found pictures of Masaryk^Benes and Stalin exhibited in the entrance hall and in the Ministers room. imagine this is the case where a Minister is a Communist. There is. probablyfar less cohesion in the Government than there is in Poland.Attitude to World AffairsThe Czechs with whom I discussed the international situation made no secretof the fact that their policy was determined by the Soviet Union. That is to say,that although they were theoretically free to disagree, and might do so, never-theless if they did relationship with the Soviet Union would be very much cooler;
and since they regarded the Soviet Union as their protectors they could not affordany deterioration in relationships which would occur in the event of a disagree-ment on foreign policy.They also were in great fear of a strengthened Germany and took very much the same line on the subject as the Poles. The collateral agreement which we have entered into with Czechoslovakia was greatly appreciated, and I did my best to assure them that so far as we were concerned this agreement was meant to be areality, and we would be happy at all times to co-operate with them in the strengthening of the ties thus created. I believe they, like the Poles, really wantour friendship and not merely as a possible reinsurance against the Soviet Union.Both countries regretted most strongly the deterioration of our relationship withthe Soviet Union, and would welcome the opportunity of playing some part in bringing us closely together. They believe that if only we and the soviet union could stand together, then with, their help, and with the help of other nations in Europe, peace can be assured for many generations to come.I should like to conclude by expressing my very deep appreciation of the help,courtesy and kindness which I received from both Embassies. Our ambassador was on leave during our stay in Poland, but Mr. Broad, Charge d&apos;Affaires, was indeed a&apos; friend to us, and we were greatly impressed by him and with his staff.Sir Philip Nichols, our Ambassador in Prague, did everything he could tomake my visit a success, and I was very much impressed with the quality of his staff, particularly with the younger men. I met a number of members of ourConsular Service, and I felt that we were most fortunate in our representatives.They all appeared to have a deep understanding of, and sympathy with, thecountry, and did us very great credit. I was a little less happy on occasion withour service attaches. I thought that some were a little indiscreet in theircriticism of the country to which they were attached, and showed insufficientunderstanding and appreciation of their difficulties.I should also like to refer to the work of the British Council in both countries.The Council is highly praised, and would, appear to be doing a fine piece of workon our behalf.L. S.Ministry of Town and Country Planning, S.W. 1,31st December, 1947.
