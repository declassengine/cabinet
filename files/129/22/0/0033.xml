THIS   DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1947SECRET       . , Copy No.^   CP. (47) 323Qth December, 1947CABINETSCOTTISH DEMANDS FOR HOME RULE OR DEVOLUTIONMemorandum^by the Secretary of State for scotland i. Summary1.   All political parties in Scotland, including the Labour Party, are taking part in an agitation for a greater measure of Scottish control over Scottish affairs.,For the reasons discussed in this Memorandum I submit the following proposals as immediately necessary :-(1) that on agreed occasions Scottish Bills should be referred to the ScottishGrand Committee for consideration in principle before Second Readingis taken (without debate) in the House of Commons;(2) that up to four days should be&quot; allocated in the Scottish Grand Committee,in addition to the normal Supply days in the House of Commons, forthe discussion of Scottish Estimates;(3) that a Scottish Economic Conference should be established under theChairmanship of the Secretary of State;(4) that an annual review of Scottish economic affairs should be made and presented to Parliament;(5) that special attention should be given to the arrangements for decentrali-sation of executive responsibility in relation to Scotland.II. Public Opinion in scotland . The agitation for a greater measure of devolution of legislative and executive responsibility does not follow party lines, but the following groupsmay be distinguished :-A-The extreme home-rulers (the Scottish Nationalist Party) who, forexample, have petitioned the United  Nations Organisation for theiremancipation.This group is picturesque and articulate; but the support for it is negligible.B.^ Scottish Convention, the less extreme wing of the Home Rule move-ment, demands a separate Parliament in Edinburgh for Scottish affairs, while retaining Scottish representation in the British Parliament for Britishaffairs.At a &quot;National Assembly&quot; held recently by the Convention detailed proposals to this end were adopted and were subsequently sent to the PrimeMinister with a request that he should receive a deputation. In decliningto do so, the Prime Minister indicated that the Assembly&apos;s, proposals mightbe submitted to me, and 1 have now been asked to meet their representatives.The strength of this group is difficult to estimate, as during elections itsvote is not recorded because of stronger loyalty to the main political parties.It has, however, a considerable number of supporters in all parties.C-By far the largest group,, and one which has strong emotional feelingbehind it in Scotland, asks that Parliament should give more time to scottish affairs and that, within the British constitution and the unity of the twocountries, the Scots themselves should have further opportunities of adminis-tering in Scotland the business of Government and of the socialised industries and other Government-appointed organisations.I append to this memorandum copies of recent resolutions by the main political parties in Scotland and of statements by party leaders.(Appendix A.)34624 , b
3. The feeling to which those who belong to Group C are now giving strongexpression has for long been latent, and has been encouraged by all political parties. During the war years, when party politics were in abeyance and thepatriotic sentiment was concentrated on the war effort, the Labour Secretary ofState in a Coalition Government, working with a Council of former secretaries of State, found it desirable and practicable to obtain Parliamentary authority forthe transfer to himself of Ministerial powers in relation to Forestry and crown lands in Scotland, and was able to initiate new Scottish enterprises (e.g., theNorth of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board) to an extent sufficient to satisfy publicopinion. With the advent of a Labour Government, it was generally anticipated,iii view of Labour&apos;s attitude over the years, that further steps would be takento increase the degree of Scottish control over Scottish affairs. So far, however,the Labour Government has established the socialised industries, in whichScottish local authorities and companies had shown considerable enterprise, ona Great Britain basis; and this has been portrayed as taking administrationfrom Scotland to London, and as failure to make adequate provision for respon-sible administration of Scottish business in Scotland. It has also been represented that Scottish enterprise in civil aviation was contemptuously suppressed; and later there was undoubtedly deep resentment at the centralised set-up of british transport. The exploitation of Scottish sentiment about the organisation ofsocialised industries on a Great Britain basis has been largely responsible for bringing matters to a head. This has been only partially allayed by such steps as the continuation and extension of the autonomy granted to the North ofScotland Hydro-Electric Board, the arrangements for administrative decentralisation-tion in relation, for example, to air services, and the decision to locate inScotland the Mechanical Engineering Research Station of the Department of scientific and Industrial Research. The recent decision of the transport commission to set up for Scotland a separate organisation of the railway executive is also a step in the right direction.4. The danger of this widespread feeling in Scotland is that it is hiddento some extent by the fact that elections are fought between the main parties. Butit betrays itself in the general uneasiness that Scotland is held to be of no account by British Governments. There is, therefore, a kind of smouldering pile thatmight suddenly break through the party loyalties and become a formidablenational movement. This is the more possible as the Labour Party programmecomes to fulfilment and the great dividing issues are settled, leaving the cleavagesbetween the parties less deep and intense.III.-The demand for an enquiry5. Members of all groups, and many people outside the groups, with theunited support of the Press, are calling, with a remarkable degree of unanimity,for an enquiry into the facts and considerations bearing on ,the question of scottish devolution. Those who ask for an enquiry have different reasons for seeking it. Some hope that it will prove any form of Parliamentary devolutionundesirable and unnecessary. Others hope that it will prove the case for theirvariety of Home Rule or of executive devolution.6. Those who ask the Government to set up a Committee of enquiry includethe Scottish Labour Party, unanimously supported by the Scottish Labour group in the House. In 1945 the Scottish Labour Party Conference passed a motionasking for the appointment of a representative Committee &quot; to consider whetherthe setting up of a Scottish Legislative Assembly with adequate powers to dealwith domestic affairs would best secure the increased well-being of Scotland.&quot;The Executive of the Scottish Council of the Labour Party, with the ScottishLabour Group in the House of CommansThave since been pursuing the matter withthe National Executive of the Party as well as with my predecessor and the lord president of the Council. The Scottish Labour Party Conference in October thisyear, against the wishes of its Executive, passed by 111 votes to 82 a further motion(the terms of which are quoted in Appendix A) reiterating the demand for an enquiry, with some censure for the delay.7., In Parliament, the question of an enquiry has been raised in both Houses,and I append to this memorandum (Appendix B) the terms of the actual questionswhich have been put, and the relevant parts of the answers which have been given.8. - In face of the atmosphere in Scotland, and of the feeling in both houses of Parliament, I take the view that it would be ultimately highly dangerous to the relationships of Scotland and England, and to confidence in our own Partyin Scotland, if the Government were to adopt a purely negative attitude.   But
the suggestions as to the terms of reference of such an enquiry are varied andseldom well-defined. They range over the desirability of further legislative and parliamentary devolution; the facts of the financial relationship of Scotland andother parts of the United Kingdom; Scottish exports and imports and the economic position of Scotland generally; the machinery of government in Scotland; andthe arrangements for the administration in Scotland of the nationalised industries.If any Committee of Enquiry were appointed it would have to include members from both sides of the Border and of Vciryiii^ poll tical views, and such members might well be found to have strongly-held opinions for and against ScottishNationalism. The possibilities of fundamental disagreement are thereforeobvious. It is unlikely that any enquiry, however wide its scope, would satisfy the varying and far-reaching demands which have been made; and the time required for detailed investigation of all aspects of the position would in anycase mean much delay. Any Committee would accordingly have to set practicallimits to its investigations, and the results would inevitably deal only withcertain aspects of the inter-relations of the two countries and would not, there-fore, provide a basis on which reliable and agreed conclusions could be drawn.I feel, therefore, that the time is not opportune to set up a formal Committeeof Enquiry and that it is more important to concentrate on practical measureswhich can be taken immediately.IV. Legislative and Parliamentary Devolution9. I think that any proposal to set up a separate Scottish Parliament shouldbe resisted, and that we should concentrate on meeting the desire of Scotsmenfor more control over their: Own affairs by making greater use, within the presentParliamentary system, of the Scottish Grand Committee for the considerationof (a) Bills and (b) Estimates. I believe that this would be satisfactory to thebulk of moderate opinion in all parties in Scotland. In the recent debate inthe House of Lords, the Duke of Montrose, speaking as a Liberal, was the onlymember who supported the claim for a separate Parliament in Edinburgh, but even he said he would welcome something less !10. As regards Bills, I have set but in Appendix C draft Standing Orders,which have been prepared in consultation with Sir Gilbert Campion; under whichthe House would be able to decide, on the motion of a Minister and in the absenceof opposition by not less than ten Members, to refer a Scottish Bill to the ScottishGrand Committee for consideration in principle. Where a Bill has been soreferred, the House could, on its return, decide without dehate and, if necessary,by a division, to give or not give it a Second Reading. The House would retain the normal Report and Third Reading stages.11. The types of Bills to which it would be suitable and convenient for theGovernment to apply this procedure would be : (1) Bills of a technical nature applying only to Scotland, which, thoughdebatable, are not controversial in a party sense for example, theSolicitors Bill at present before the Lords.(2) Bills which repeat for Scotland legislation already passed by the house for England and Wales.  This would give several advantages :- (a) It would relieve the House of the time at present required for suchduplicate Bills;(b) It would enable the Scottish Bill to follow more quickly on the Billfor England and Wales;(c) It would simplify legislation by making it less necessary than atpresent, in order to save time in the House, to introduce UnitedKingdom Bills with complicated Scottish application clauses.(3) Bills which are at present allocated to the &quot; if there is time &quot; category,where delay, though not vital, causes great inconveniences and some-times hardship.12. Recently, Sir Gilbert Campion made a proposal that the Second reading of Scottish Bills should go to the Scottish Grand Committee. When this wasunder consideration by the Select Committee a Paper was circulated to the Cabinet(7th March, 1946, CP. (46) 97) as a result of which the Cabinet authorised the submission to the Select Committee of a Memorandum dealing with Sir GilbertCampion&apos;s proposals as follows : &quot; The proposals to transfer the Second Reading of Scottish Bills to theScottish Standing Committee would probably not be generally popular.   It34624 B 2
would appear to put Scottish Bills into an inferior class inappropriate for thefull attention of the Mother of Parliaments, and Scottish Members would be deprived of the opportunity to speak to them on the floor of the House.Even if, nevertheless, the proposal were popular with Scottish Members, itWould probably be unwelcome to Members for English constituencies (someof whom are Scots), since they would, even more completely than at present, be debarred from debate on purely Scottish Bills. The Government, therefore, ioppose these proposals also.&quot;The Select Committee reported on the proposal as follows :-&quot;One of Sir Gilbert Campion&apos;s proposals for the reorganisation of standing committees stands apart from the main scheme and must be con-sidered separately. This is the suggestion that procedure should be provided to enable the House, if it so desired, to transfer the second reading of scottish Bills to the Scottish Standing Committee. In view of the consti-tutional implications of this proposal and the objections to it which are likelyto be raised by both Scottish and other Members, your Committee are unablerecommend it to the House.&quot;13. Whether my proposals would or would not be popular with Scottishmembers is a matter to be ascertained by informal discussions, which I contemplateshould be undertaken. The objections that they would appear to put Scottish Billsinto an inferior category and would deprive Scottish Members of opportunities ofspeaking on the floor of the House is met by the provision that the House itself would decide, on a Government motion, whether or not the Bill should be referredto the Scottish Grand Committee for debate; would formally decide the SecondReading; and would retain control of the Report and Third Reading stages. the objection that English Members might resent their exclusion from Scottish debatesis met in three ways : -(1) Such Members may be added to the Scottish Grand Committee inaccordance with the usual practice;(2) Such Members may object to the Bill going to the Scottish Grand Com-mittee; and(3) All the Members of the House have control over the Bill when it returns to house of Commons for the Report Stage.At present, the Scottish Grand Committee is composed of Scots Members plus15 Members added by the Committee of Selection. The purpose of addingMembers is to enable the Government of the day to assure themselves of a. majority on the Committee and to allow Members from other than Scottish constituenciesto take part in Scottish business. The addition of Members could be extended, ifnecessary.14. As regards Estimates, the Opposition placed on the Order Paper on22nd October a draft Standing Order proposing that, on the motion of a ScottishMinister, Scottish Estimates might be referred, in whole or in part, to the ScottishGrand Committee for consideration. After such consideration, the Estimateswould come formally before the Committee of Supply in the ordinary way. Ithink that this proposal should be accepted, with a limitation to four in the numberof days which can be spent by the Scottish Committee on Scottish Estimates, andon the understanding that it does not involve the resignation of the normal twoScottish Supply days on the floor of the House; A draft of the necessary standing order is included in Appendix C.15. After the first world war the experiment was tried of referringEstimates to a United Kingdom Standing Committee, but was abandoned partly because of the difficulty of finding a quorum on the Committee. The proposal forreferring Scottish Estimates to the Scottish Grand Committee was revived betweenthe two wars by Mr. Tom Johnston, Mr. Henderson Steward and others. Itarose again during the war. It was rejected in 1937 by Colonel Walter Elliot, whowas then Secretary of State, mainly on the grounds that it would not necessarilygive more time to the Scottish Members; for discussion of the Estimates and thatit would make it more difficult for the Scots Ministers and Members to find timefor their other duties. There was also the fear that the Scottish Grand committee might assume the duties of a Public Accounts Committee and go into too great detail.16. If these objections were made to the present proposal they could easily be met    There is no reason to anticipate difficulty in finding a quorum for
meetings of the Scottish Grand Committee. As I do not propose to relinquish thetwo ordinary Scottish Supply days, any discussion of estimates in the ScottishGrand Committee would necessarily mean that Scottish affairs were receiving moreParliamentary time. It would admittedly place an additional strain on ScottishMinisters and occupy time which they and Scottish Members generally would otherwise give to other business; and it would also make Scottish representation in other Standing Committees more difficult. But if Scottish affairs are to receive more attention in Parliament these are difficulties which must be faced. Asregards the fear that the Scottish Grand Committee might usurp the functions ofa Public Accounts Committee I do not think it is well-founded.17. My proposals as regards both Estimates arid Bills would give more time for the discussion of Scottish affairs by Scottish Members while preservingthree principles which I regard as essential, viz. : (1) The Government must retain control over the procedure;(2) The House of Commons control of the legislation and the Estimates mustbe preserved;(3) The procedure must be flexible so that it can be varied according to theimportance of the legislation and the state of the timetable in theHouse of Commons itself.They would enable Scottish subjects to be discussed which are at present debarredby shortage of time from receiving consideration. There would also be this furtheradvantage. When business is taken on the floor of the House, Press space is usuallyexhausted by the statements of the Ministers and the front bench and in conse-quence Scots Members get little show in the Press in Scotland. They have all to speak on the one day, and, however willing the newspapers may be, they simplycould not report their speeches. If, however, the Debates on Scottish business werespread over a number of days, there would be more scope for the Scots Members to speak and there would be Press space on several days on which other news mightbe less pressing when Scots Members could be reported. Perhaps the mostimportant aspect of this is that the Scottish public would be kept more fully informed.18. I have endeavoured to estimate what the effect of these proposals wouldhave been during the 1946-47 Session. The House of Commons sat on 164 days.It is necessary to disregard a number of days at- the beginning and end ofthe Session, and if we assume that the Scottish Grand Committee could have met twice in every five days, the maximum number of meetings would have been about 54. In fact it met on 41 days; so that 13 sittings would have been availablefor the new business which I suggest might be given to it. The Second Readingsof Scottish Bills falling into the categories mentioned in paragraph 11 occupied2\ days on the floor of the House. If one day on the floor of the House isregarded as equivalent to three days in Committee the discussion of the general principles of these Bills would have occupied 8 sittings. During the present session the possible Scottish Bills suitable for reference to the Grand Committee(Education, Public Registers, Lord High Commissioner, Solicitors, Legal aid and Lunacy) might be expected to occupy about the same time. There would therefore be a sufficient number of days left for the discussion of the ScottishEstimates.19. Should my colleagues agree provisionally to my proposals, I should propose as a first step to consult Scottish Members about them.V--Financial Relationships between Scotland and Other Parts of the UnitedKingdom20. So far as the financial relationships between Scotland and other partsof the United Kingdom are concerned, a Return of Revenue and Expenditure inScotland was, after considerable research, published in 1932. But while it showedScotland to come out on the right side, it provided no facts which were accepted as conclusive by any who held strong views on the subject, as it was found thatno basis existed for ascertaining and separating these facts with any acceptabledegree of accuracy. If it could be done without undue pressure on staff, a re-issueof this Return in an up-to-date form would, nevertheless, be of some value, andI recommend that the possibility of getting out a fresh Return should be explored.VI. Scotland&apos;s Economic Position21. The primary concern of those who are pressing for a review of adminis-trative arrangements in Scotland is with economic affairs and with the organisa-
tion of the socialised industries. In view of this I propose, as an immediatestep, the creation of a &quot;Scottish Economic Conference&quot; representative of all departments and organisations covering economic interests in Scotland, includingthe socialised industries. The Conference, which would sit under my Chairman-ship (or in my absence that of one of my Parliamentary Under-Secretaries), wouldhave the following objects :-(a) To provide a forum for the discussion of economic questions affectingScotland, and so to enable all concerned to keep themselves informed of developments in all fields.(6) To enable the Secretary of State to keep himself in closer and morepersonal touch with Scottish economic questions and to adviseMinisters concerned, particularly the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The composition of the Scottish Economic Conference would be on the lines indicated in Appendix D. Meetings would be held as and when desirable, possiblyat intervals of two or three months.22. As to the facts of Scotland&apos;s economic position, the available informa-tion can only be supplied by the Government; and I propose to publish and present to Parliament an annual review of the main developments and trends in theeconomic affairs of Scotland. The form and content of this review will require careful consideration in consultation with the Departments concerned and theEconomic Section of the Cabinet Office. I do not think, however, that it will bepossible to meet the demand for a full statement of Scottish exports and imports.For example, while figures are published for imports and exports through all ports,there is no record or the ultimate source or destination of the commodities soexported or imported.VII. The Machinery of Government and the Socialised Industries in Scotland,23. The foregoing proposals are unlikely to be regarded as a complete answerby those who criticise the present machinery of Government administration inScotland on the ground that it is subject to too much detailed control by head-quarters in London and elsewhere which are not sufficiently acquainted withScottish circumstances and opinions. I am at present preparing a comprehensive statement of the organisation which Government Departments have set up inScotland for the discharge of their functions; this will show a wide measure ofdevolved responsibility and the facts could, if necessary, be published. In thefirst place, however, I think that they should be examined interdepartmentally.Pending the results of such an examination I should propose to take theline that the machinery of Government administration in Scotland is, of course,kept continually under review in order that it may be adapted as necessary tochanging circumstances from time to time; that much in the way of decentralisation^-tion of executive responsibility in relation to Scotland has already been accom-plished and that special attention will be given as opportunity offers to thepossibilities of further developments in this direction which would conduce to greater efficiency.24. As regards socialised industries, I should propose to say that the newBoards are in course of developing their own organisation within the wide limits of discretion given to them by Parliament, and that the Government will keep under observation the general pattern of these arrangements as they are worked out, in order to ensure that they are properly related to Scottish needs. .25. The proposals outlined in this Memorandum have been discussed withthe Lord President of the Council and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whoare in general agreement with them. I should like to have the authority of mycolleagues to explore confidentially my legislative and parliamentary proposals with Scottish Labour Members of Parliament&quot; and my proposals generally with-Scottish Labour Members and the Executive of the Scottish Council ofthe Labour Party. Thereafter I should submit my final proposals, arid a draftof a Parliamentary statement for specific approval. The matter is of somei urgency. There is a powerful upsurge of Scottish spirit at the moment which,if rebuffed, will suffer disappointment and it would discourage and to some extentshake the faith of our own Labour supporters if they felt we had let them downin face of their public.A.

APPENDIX A1. PARTY RESOLUTIONS ON DEVOLUTIONLabourThat this Conference, recognising the importance of a full examination of thewhole question of the future Government of Scotland being made and completed before the next General Election, expresses its concern that so much delay shouldhave arisen in the appointment of the Representative Committee urged by the1945 Conference to undertake this Examination. The Conference, being of theopinion that the very comprehensive social and economic measures enacted by theGovernment during the last two years affecting Scotland have placed a very lieavyand increasing burden of responsibility on the Secretary of State, considers thatthe Appointment of a Committee of Inquiry into the existing legislative methodsof dealing with Scottish domestic affairs &quot;has become an urgent necessity, andinstruct the Executive Committee to press the matter strongly through the ScottishParliamentary Group and the National Executive Committee of the Party.Resolution was adopted by 111 votes to 82. (Scottish Council of Labour PartyDundee, October 1947.) .ConservativeIn view of the increasing measure of control in Scottish administration byWhitehall and the nationalisation policy of the Socialist Government which was taking away from Scotland management of her industries, the Conference calledupon the Party to announce without delay as its policy the de-control of scottish administration and industry from London. The Resolution was unanimouslyapproved.  (Scottish Unionist Association, Ayr, May 1947.)National Liberal: A Resolution which deplored the increasing control of Scottish affairs from london, noted the growing demand from all sections of the community in scotland for a greater measure of control of her own affairs, and called upon the Governmentto appoint a Royal Commission to consider how this rightful demand could best besatisfied was unanimously adopted. (Scottish Liberal National Association,Rothesay, October 1947.)Liberal &apos; . ,        , .L A Resolution urging the introduction of a Scottish Legislature, with financialpowers which would be the final legislation authority for Scottish affairs was unanimously carried.   (Scottish Liberal Party, Inverness, May 1947.)2.-PARTY VIEWS IN FAVOUR OF SOME FORM OF DEVOLUTIONMr. ChurchillWhen Scotland is increasingly confronted by hard applications of Socialistfallacy with all its resulting centralisation in London, it will become more andmore necessary for the Scottish people to assert their right to manage their affairsunder, conditions which do not leave them entirely controlled by the WhitehallDepartments. The Unionist Party in Scotland will have all our aid in looking after that.  (May 1947.) -Earl of RoseberyThere are many examples of the spreading power of the Whitehall octopusat the expense of Scotland such as the Whitehall control of civil aviation, oneof the consequences of which has been the increasing neglect of PrestwickAirport./ In my view Home Rule for Scotland in its full sense would not be wise. Itwould necessitate the setting up of.&apos; a separate Scottish Parliament whichwould be a slow and costly business and it might do much to break the essentiallinks with the rest of Britain. No far-seeing Scotsman wants to build an iron curtain on the Cheviots. What Scotland really needs is the speedy build-up of a proper system of regionalisation. Within the framework of the general Britishpattern Scotland should be given the power to administer her own affairs on the spot free from detailed directives from Whitehall. Scotland does not need thepower to make her own exclusive laws; she does need the power to administer her own affairs.
I urge that a public inquiry of an official character should at once be set on foot so that without delay the most practical means can be found whereby theScottish people can fulfil this reasonable ambition. But in Scotland, as elsewhere,prosperity will not return until this Government has been turned out and isreplaced by one capable of dealing with the situation. This is the overwhelmingneed of the present time.   (October 1947.)Sir Archibald Sinclair ,The Scottish Liberal Party would have the full support of the Liberal Partyin demanding that responsibility for Scottish legislation and administration shallbe devolved on Scotsmen and Scotswomen living and working in Scotland(May 1947.)APPENDIX BPARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS, &amp;c, ABOUT SCOTTISH DEVOLUTION- House of Commons4th NovemberMr. Tom Hubbard. To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland : &quot; If he is aware of the desire in Scotland for an inquiry into the practicability of improvements in the arrangements for dealing with Scottish legislation and administration; and if he will make a statement.&quot;Reply:&quot; I am aware of the various sentiments being expressed in Scotland onthese matters and am at present exploring the position and possible action.&quot;25th NovemberLieut.-Commander Clark Hutchison. To ask the Secretary of State forScotland : &quot; Whether he has any statement to make in regard to the proposal that theScottish Estimates should be discussed by the Standing Committee on scottish bills.&quot;Reply: ,&quot;I am giving urgent consideration to this and other suggestions aboutthe arrangements for dealing with Scottish business; but I. am not yet in aposition to make a statement.&quot;House of Lords30th JulyViscount Elibank. To ask His Majesty&apos;s Government, whether, in view ofthe tendency in present-day legislation to centralise the control and administra-tion of industry and commerce in Whitehall and to prevent the establishment of responsible resident direction and management, they will now (having regard tothe strong Scottish feeling in these matters) set up a Commission of Inquiry toexamine the principles tor securing effective devolution of control and administra-tion in Scotland, and make recommendations.Reply :&quot; His Majesty5s Government do not agree that present-day legislationtends in the direction suggested. In the many fields of industry and commercewhich are in private hands, the determination of the appropriate administra-tive centre for any particular undertaking is a matter for the industrial and commercial interests concerned. In the case of industries which have beenor are about to be socialised, His Majesty&apos;s Government have been at pains to ensure that within the arrangements for Great Britain as a whole thereis the greatest practicable devolution of authority arid provision tor dealingwith special Scottish conditions.
&quot;As regards the machinery of the Central Government itself, all theDepartments for which my right honourable friend, the Secretary of State. : for Scotland, is responsible, are administered in Scotland, and the Depart-ments of Ministers whose functions extend to the whole of Great britain are represented in Scotland by responsible officers to whom is delegatedauthority to enable Scottish business to be settled on the spot. The arrange-ments for the conduct of Scottish business are, and will continue to be,kept under close review so as to ensure that the machinery of the various departments and of the boards of socialised industries is properly related,    to Scottish needs.&quot;13th NovemberViscount Elibank. To ask His Majesty&apos;s Government, whether, in viewof the tendency in present-day legislation to centralise control and administra-tion in Whitehall, and to prevent the establishment of responsible residentdirection and management, they will, having regard to the strong Scottishfeelings in these matters, set up a Representative Committee of Inquiry to examinethe principles and to make recommendations for effective devolution of controLand administration in Scotland : and to move for Papers.EMr act from reply:  &apos;&quot; The Secretary of State authorises me to say that he is fully-conscious of the feeling in Scotland regarding the desirability of a more intimate. control by Scotland over its own affairs, and he is pursuing his inquiriesinto the possibility of action as a matter of urgency.&quot;2nd DecemberThe Lord Lindsay of Birker.
