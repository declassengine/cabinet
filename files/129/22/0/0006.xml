(47) 29626th October, 1947CABINETINTERNATIONAL BILL OF RIGHTSCompulsory LabourMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service at the meeting of the Human Rights Commission of the United nations in December the question of compulsory labour will come up for discussion inrelation to the draft Bill of Human Rights. This subject appears to me to raise a vital issue on policy which it is necessary for the Cabinet to consider at thisstage, in order that our representative on the Commission may have authoritativeguidance. The issue is whether any provision for prohibiting compulsory labour should make a general exception in the case of compulsory labour which isiperformed as a public service incumbent on all citizens.2. I should emphasise at the outset that the problem is related to what may be described as normal peace-time conditions, and not to times of war orperiods of national emergency, which would be specially provided for. There is,therefore, no question of limiting our freedom of action for dealing with thepresent crisis, since we are still in the period of national emergency created by the war, and the Bill of Human Rights could not, in any event, come intoforce for two or three years at the earliest. Nor, as I understand it, wouldour freedom be limited for dealing with any similar situation in the future,since any State would, in such circumstances, have the right to invoke the&quot; national emergency &quot; clause of the Bill.3. The matter was considered at an earlier stage in inter-departmentaldiscussions on the draft of the Bill which has been circulated by the UnitedKingdom to the Drafting Committee of the Commission and has been published,In that draft it was originally proposed to include the following elause : &quot; Compulsory labour shall not be permitted in any form except as apublic service incumbent generally on citizens, or as part of the punishmentof persons duly convicted and sentenced by a court of law for a criminal offence.&quot;4. The Ministry of Labour and National Service objected to the words initalics for the following reasons : (i) The article with these words included made provision for the use of compulsory labour at times other than in war or national emergency(war or national emergency is covered by a general escape elause).No responsible political party has, in modern times, suggested thatcompulsory labour should be part of our normal peace-time law, andit is to me not conceivable that this country should appear as theproponent of such an encroachment on fundamental human rights,(ii) The article permitted and indeed indirectly encouraged totalitarianStates to apply compulsory labour to the whole of their population.While it is unlikely that the adoption of the Bill would effectivelyalter the practices of such States, it is most undesirable that the Billshould appear to give sanction to such practices.34395
(iii) If there are circumstances (apart from war or national emergency)in which compulsory labour is justifiable they may be expected inpractice to relate only to particular industries or services such as agriculture or building or to particular classes of persons and not to-,; the whole field.  The clause as drafted would not permit the selectiveapplication of compulsion. Nor would any clause applying generally to all citizens permit particular industries or particular classes of  persons to be selected for compulsory direction,(iv) On the other hand a clause drafted on a selective basis would be dangerous, would open the door to discrimination and, for these veryreasons, would not be acceptable to other countries generally. In anycase such a clause would not meet the fundamental objections setout in (i) and (ii) above. . v5. In consequence of these objections the clause was omitted from the UnitedKingdom draft as published. Instead a statement was included in the draft to the effect that a clause relating to compulsory labour would be inserted later.v.-;- ,6- At the Drafting Committee held in New York the United States repre-sentative proposed the following clause : &quot; No person shall be required to perform compulsory labour in any formother than public service equally incumbent by law on all, or as part of apunishment pronounced by a competent judicial tribunal.&apos;&apos;    -7. It will be seen that this draft is substantially the same as the one towhich I objected earlier. The objections set out in paragraph 4 above-r-objectionsrelating both to the principle of compulsory labour in normal peace-time conditions and to the difficulties of the practical application of such a provision-apply with equal force to the United: States draft which for these reasons should,in my view, be firmly opposed by the United Kingdom Government, representative at the meeting of the Human Rights Commission which is to be held in December.. 8: The suggestion has been made that the United Kingdom government need hot take a definite line at that meeting, but should merely reserve its position, leaving the question to be thoroughly thrashed out when the report ofthe Human Rights Commission is considered by the Economic and Social Council.In my view this would be wrong. In the first place it would be unfair to leave our representative on the Human Rights Commission (Lord Dukestori) in the dark asto British Government policy on this vital issue. Secondly, if as I hope, mycolleagues share my view on the principle involved, that principle,would fee hope-lessly prejudiced if the Commission adopted the United States draft with theUnited Kingdom merely reserving its position. In such circumstances it wouldbe extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have the decision reversed subsequentlywhen the question came before the Economic and Social Council&apos;.&apos;   -&quot;9. The question arises what alternative the United Kingdom representative should present. In the first place, I suggest that he should propose that theInternational Labour Organisation should be asked to advise on the provision which should be made in the Bill Of Rights for a clause on compulsory labour.The question of compulsory labour is highly delicate and complex, and more over it is within the field of the International Labour Organisation which has already adopted a convention on the subject (International Labour Convention No. 29).Discussion through the International Labour Organisation would give organised labour and industry an opportunity to take part in the consideration of a subject which is of vital importance to them.10. Should the Human Rights Commission accept this proposal it may not prove necessary at this stage for the British Delegation to suggest an alternativeform of words. If, however, this should be necessary either because the Commis-sion dojiot accept the suggestion to recommend reference of the matter to theInternational Labour Organisation or because, while accepting that suggestion,they would wish to submit to it a specific form of words, I suggest thefollowing:-&quot; Compulsory labour shall not be, permitted in any form except as partof the punishment of persons duly convicted and sentenced by a court of lav/for a criminal offence.&quot;
fit  would be necessary to make it clear that compulsory labour, for thepurposes of this clause, does not include :  (a) compulsory military service, or non-military service exacted from con-scientious objectors;(&amp;) services exacted in cases of emergency created by fire, flood, famine,earthquake, violent epidemic or epizootic diseases, invasion by animal,insect, vegetable pest or similar calamities or other emergenciesthreatening the life of the community. (A similar exception was included in International Labour Convention No. 29.)It will probably also be necessary to provide that, in territories, such ascolonial territories, where exceptional conditions exist necessitating, in the publicinterest and for public purposes only, recourse to compulsory labour for the timebeing, the abolition of compulsory labour should be brought about progressivelyover a short transitional period. Similar provision was included in InternationalLabour Convention No. 29.11.   To sum up I propose : (1) that the Cabinet should decide now that it will support the inclusion in the Bill on Human Rights of a provision in general prohibiting the use, except in time of war or national emergency, of compulsorylabour;(2) that the United Kingdom representative on the Human Rights Commis-sion should oppose the United States draft clause on this subject;(3) that our representative should propose that the Human Rights Corn-mission recommend that the International Labour organisation should be asked to advise on the form of the provision relating to compulsory labour to be included in the Bill of Human Rights;(4) that, if it seems desirable or necessary to do so, he should himself proposea clause on the lines and subject to the conditions set out inparagraph 10 above.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and national Service, S.W. 1,20th October, 1947.
