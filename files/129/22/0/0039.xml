(THIS DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.CP. (47)  529 &apos;  COPY NO. ^ 2&quot;11TH DECEMBER,  1947CABINETPRIORITY FOR BUILDING LABOUR &apos;Memorandum by the Minister off health i ask my colleagues to give further considerationto the proposal,to which the Production Committee agreed on 5th December (?.c (47)&apos; 4th Meeting, Minute 3), to withdraw&apos; from housing the W.B.A. priority which has hitherto been accorded to it.2. I appreciate that the proposal made is not to with-draw this priority from existing contracts. rThis does hot, however, .resolve my difficulties. -3* Houses erected by local authorities before tho war were about 800 superficial foot in size and, it is usuallystated,.required ono man-year for completion;   Houses now under construction for local authorities&apos;are about 1,000 feet in size and are better equipped.    Without allowing for any fallin the productivity of building labour, 1^ man-years are now required to build a house.   To complete a house in 12 months would thus require an average of 1-jr men as compared Yirith thepresent average of one.    If the declared object of quickeningthe speed of completion is to be attained, the number of menper house under construction, must, therefore, be increased.A gradual fall in the number off houses under construction is,of course,&quot; planned, but, by next June,&apos; the figure -will still&apos;be 210,000 houses, equivalent to 260,000 men at 1-4 men per house;-,i.e. the same force as- at. present employed.4* In the course of decreasing the number of houses under construction, the number of men reporting to theEmployment Exchanges should increase and these men will only:be directed to. other new housing, work in the same neighbourhood,if new housing continues to enjoy W.B.A. priority.   At present,after having, regard *fco the Prime minister is-Priority List,the Exchanges can al?^ays place a.....man with building experience in housing jobs within the area.    If W.B.A. priority for housing is withdrawn, men with such experience may be directed to different occupations.5. These are not the only difficulties.   The housing programme is a continuous one.    As houses are completed, new contracts are let.: The number off houses included in new contracts is being controlled so as to give effect to thepolicy off balancing the &quot;programme by reducing the number ofhouses under construction and the number in tenders approvedbut not yet started.    The houses included in these new contracts
cannot, however, bo differentia tod in regard to urgency fromthose included in existing contracts.   In fact they will, inaccordance with tho announced decision of the Government,include a larger proportion of houses for minors,.agricultural workers, and key workers in development areas.6. I have considered whether the position could be met by the grant of W.B.A. priority for such houses only.    I have concluded that it would not be possible to defend this course in determining tho number of new houses for which contracts should be let in a particular zone within which labour is assumed to be mobile an increased proportion of houses forthe priority groups will be secured o&quot;.g., in the Plymouth zoneno doubt an increased number of houses will require to be allocated to the rural districts of Tavistock and PlymptonSt. Mary as compared with Plymouth.   But when tho allocationshave been made it would in my view be difficult to defend thesuperimposition of an additional priority in regard to thesupply of labour.7. I note that it is not proposed to give any specialpublicity to the change.    I cannot, however, see that suchpublicity can be avoided.   The existence of the special priority for works which would result in the provision of now-housing accommodation has been widely publicised and its-withdrawal in regard to specified contracts would be tooobvious to be concealed.8. It must, therefore, bo patent that tho priorityhitherto accorded and announced as accorded in regard to housing is being withdrawn and that it is being withdrawn ata time when the now housing programme, despite the best efforts of the Ministry of Labour and National Service,  is still under-manned.9v New house building by local authorities is notoriouslythe part:of housing to which it is most difficult to attractlabour, because, owing to the control over prices,  it is lesslucrative than other housing work,    it is at the same timethe aspect of housing to which the Government and, as I believe,the country have attached tile greatest importance and value.The erection of houses under licence has in effect beer-suspended in order to concentrate resources on the building of houses which can be shown to go to those in the greatest need.    I should see-no objection to tho withdrawal of W.B.A.priority from proposals for adaptation and conversion&apos;ofhouses by private persons.10. I -would, however, &apos; urge ray colleagues to defer fora period of at least six months the proposal to withdraw W.B.A.priority from housing contracts for the erection of new housosor for conversion or adaptation by local authorities in order-to allow, time for the proper manning of such schemes.A *B .Ministry of Health,11th December, 194.7*
