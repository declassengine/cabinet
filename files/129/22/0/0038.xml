-    188(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SEC RET COPY NO. J2--ir&quot;*C.P.(47) 52811th December,  1947*CABINETWHITE PISH industry memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary of .State for scotland the Fisheries Ministers propose the establishment ofa White Fish Production Board,  independent of the industryand subject to direction by the Fisheries Ministers, withwide powers to re-organise, regulate and develop the whitefish industry at the ports.      The main objectives of the ^Board would be: -(1) the-maximum increase in the production of fish andfish products consistent with the preservation.offish stocks;(2)    the replacement of obsolete vessels and the&apos; adoption of the most modern methods of handling,freezing and processing fish on sea and at the ports;(3)    the promotion of research and training of personnel in conjunction with existing agencies;. (4)    the improvement of quality and the adoption of* better standards of accommodation for crews onfishing vessels and for fish workers at ports;(5)    the development of co-operative methods in theinshore fishing industry and in ancillary tradesat all fishing ports.The Board would require power to:-(a) secure the merger of trawler owners, processors,and wholesale merchants at the -ports of landinginto larger and more efficient combined units;-   (b)    license -vessels, catchers,  processors and wholesalemerchants at the ports;(c) make loans for building fishing vessels;(d) space out landings so as to enable increased  -supplies of.fish to be handled by the labour available and prevent wastage of manpower;(e) . process fish at the ports,.e.g.  quick freezing,&apos; smoking and &quot;salting, where such facilities cannot, otherwise be provided;    and
(f)    work out a scheme for substituting for auctions atthe ports a system, of graded prices for fish andfish products on a first.sale.The Fisheries Ministers would require powers togive directions to the Production Board and also inconjunction with the Minister of Food to fix prices on a first hand sale of fish and fish products.2. Our proposals raise the question of the line of demarcation between the functions of the Fisheries ministers and the Minister of Food, on which so for no decision hasbeen mode.      We contend that our sphere of supervision should include all activities on the sea and at the ports of landing,so that we would be able effectively to control the fishing industry up to the point at which fish is ready to leave the ports of landing for inland distribution.     We base this contention on the fact that under our proposals, catching,processing and packaging would become a combined operation.This would not interfere with any proposals for distributionwhich the Minister of Food may wish to bring forward andwould leave him free to carry on a policy of non-interferencewith the distributive side of the industry or.to set up abuying corporation with the ultimate intention of nationalisingwholesaling functions.3* In order that our colleagues may appreciate the realissue between the Minister of Food and ourselves it isnecessary that we should draw their attention to certainwrong impressions given by CP. (1+7)  325-&apos;(1)    Producers&apos; Board.      Our proposal is not to set upa Producers&apos; Board as the Minister of Food claims,but to create a Production Board independent ofthe industry and subject to direction by Ministers.(2)    Imports.      We propose that the Board should controlcatches landed from foreign trawlers direct at united Kingdom ports.      It would not,  however,have any soy in the quantities to be landed by such trawlers, nor would it be responsible forthe purchase of foreign fish which would remain,as now,  a matter for the Minister of Food.      Hewould then have complete&apos; control of the quantitiesof foreign caught fish landed in the United&apos;   Kingdom and could:-,.....by adjusting imports,  preventexploitation by British producers.(3)    Distribution Board.      Originally our proposalsrelated solely to a Production Board as we do not wish to accept any responsibility for distribution.The suggestion that there should be 0 DistributionBoard came from, the deliberations of-the sub-committee of the    Lord Presidents Committee whichwas charged with resolving the differences betweenthe Minister of Food and -ourselves.(4)    Unnecessary charge of  11 millions to fall on the -Treasury.The  11 millions mentioned in our proposals are tobe used for loans to the industry for replacing the near and middle water fleet, repayable withinten years,  and bearing an appropriate rate .ofinterest.      The ultimate charge would not fall onthe Treasury.      In view of building costs we feelthat unless a measure of this kind is introduced thenear and middle water fleet will not be rebuilt.
4* As we understand the present position the Minister ofFood objects to-our proposals and in doing so has put forward at various times a counter proposal (a) to set up a small   -public corporation, to buy quick frozen fish and trade infresh fish (L. P. (1+7) 31,  paragraph 34 (d) and (e));    and (b)to set up an interdepartmental Committee of not more than three or four senior officials representing the agricultural and Fisheries Departments and the Ministry of Food, with perhaps a Parliamentary.Secretary in the chair,  to moke scontinuous investigation of all the industry&apos;s- problems, toauthorise action on their own responsibility or where necessary,to .seek authority from Departmental Ministers-      Wheredifferences: arose which could not be resolved by this procedurethey would be referred to the Lord Presidents Committee(L.P. (47) 133, paragraph 1.5).. We are convinced, that these measures will not.solve the problems of the fishing industry.;.   They would not,  forexample,  prevent wasteful duplication of freezing plants or   -the purchasing of poor quality fish aV low prices for freezingand subsequent release at high prices during periods ofscarcity.:-     - N&apos;--&apos;----.\ -       &apos; . .-&quot;V -   -&apos;.&apos;      -: - &apos;.--...&apos;;..&apos;.&apos;-   &apos; - &apos;y&apos;^&apos; :5*  . We are told that the fishing industry is prosperous,operating successfully and that&apos; supplies are nearly meetingdemand at current, prices,  giving large returns to employersand employees &quot;alike.      We are. accused of bias because we have pointed out that the fishing industry consists of three well-defined sections,  (1) the distant water trawler fisheryoperated by 130 large trawlers from Hull, 86 from Grimsby and53 from various other ports which this year have produced 45per cent,  of our total home&apos;caught, fish supplies;    .(2.) the near and middle water trawlers numbering some 770 which alsoproduced this year 45 per cent, of our home caught fish supplies,and (3) the inshore fishing fleet,  consisting of small boots,which produces the remaining. 10 per cent,  of - our catch.      Thedistant water trawlers, are able to operate at. prices which mean a loss to the near and middle water trawler owners and theinshore fishermen as at present organised.      This is reflected in the cument building programme; which consists of 58 distant &quot;water trawlers,  8 middle water trawlers and four near watertrawlers,  although 80 per &quot;cent, of the 770 near and middle,water trawlers are obsolete, with grossly inadequate crewaccommodation and are urgently in need of replacement by newvessels.6. We do hot regard the distant water -trawlers as beingefficient.      It is true that they are larger and more modernvessels than the near water trawlers, but it has yet to be shown that the distant water trawlers are capable of landingfish of good quality.      Fish may lie in their holds for anything&apos;up to a fortnight and even the owners of these vessels admit that such fish aught not to be frozen on landing.7. We are also accused of being restrictionist andendeavouring to set up monopolies for selected groups.      Thereis nothing in-our proposals which would prevent the adoptionof an all-out fishing policy and we- are-confident that if the distributive machine is properly overhauled,  the Britishtrawler fishing industry will be only too glad to catch and land maximum supplies.     We must point out, however, that asthe catching capacity of the fishing fleet becomes greater,:either through an &quot;increase.in numbers or by increased efficiency of vessels, -the size of gluts at some times and shortages at
others will also increase unless there is some authority with power to space-out landings so as to maintain a bsleocebetween these and the handling -capacity at, the ports.Unspaced landings also cause waste of labour,  e.g.  at Grimsby   .during August,  1947 9 1,694 days were lost by lumpers who werenot required because of small landings on certain days,  and inSeptember,  1947,  1,905 days were lost.      Similar wastage of manpower went on at other-ports.8. Producers tend to&quot;restrict supplies because of theirfear of the inability,of the distributive machine to handle the supplies and to market them St reasonable prices.      our proposals anticipate the dangers envisaged by the Minister of food in that the Production Board will be directed, to work towards a system of fixed graded prices on a first hand saleof fish and fish products.      These prices would be fixed by.the Fisheries Ministers and the Minister of Food who, byreason of this and   his ability to import foreign&apos;supplies,would have the strongest possible protection for consumers.Under such a scheme restriction could only result in loss tothe producers.3* In support of his arguments about restriction the&quot;&quot;&apos;&apos;Minister of Food quotes the action of- the Herring industry board in the early part of this.summer when certain measuresof control Were imposed on the herring fleet and in theresult, there -were Insufficient supplies of herring for conversion into oil. and meal. &apos;    The Herring Industry Board were in factplaced in a dilemma.      The fishermen are. very strongly organised and if they fear that there is ony;chance of landing moreherring than can be disposed of at acceptable prices,  theyhave no hesitation in imposing severe restrictions on fishing.The Board were ultimately forced to -impose certain limitedrestrictions because if they hod not done, so- the fishermen, wh.had already started to restrict-fishing, would have imposedmore stringent res/restrictions.      This would hove resulted ininsufficient supplies not only for oil and meal but for allother purposes including the home market.      The Board&apos;s actionled to greater quantities of herring being landed thanotherwise would, have been the case,. -    Their powers do not enable them to coerce thefishermen and their attempts to persuade the &apos;f is he mi en to accept the Minister of Food&apos;s offer of 30/- per cran for.herring for oil.and meal were unsuccessful.Though this was a subsidised price it was not regarded.by thefishermen as sufficient reward for the additional effort,required to, produce additional supplies/ (a) because it was low.compared with,the prices received by fishermen for the mainp.art of their catch,  and (b) because the offer was limited tothe quantity of herring required to fill thV limited capacity ofthe available plant..     The Minister of Food could offer no price at all for supplies, in excess of about &quot;five thousand crons perweek,  a figure which would often have been exceeded if norestrictions hod been imposed.10. We are convinced that, the solution of thedifficulties experienced by the Herring Industry Board in the.first half of 1947 lies in an extension of the powers of the.Board so that they may pay one price&apos;for herrings for whateverpurpose they are used.      Such a price has been paid at Lerwicfcwhere the.Board&apos;s experimental scheme has been most successfuljand in our proposals we would give the Board the necessary powers,  the absence of which was a - substantial contributorycause of the troubles about which the Minister of Food complains.
11. The Minister of Food claims that the industry shouldhe freed as soon as possible from, all controls,  and he. refers&quot;to steps he has already, taken to admit new entrants as fishwholesale merchants at the ports.      This has not added to thesupplies of fish available for distribution,, and on many dayssuch merchants have, had as little as one box of fish to dispose ofand on other occasions none at all.      It is notorious thatthere are too many coastal wholesale fish merchants, many ofwhom would be much better employed in other parts of theindustry.12. The Minister :;f Pood states that the ultimate-solution of the problems of the fishing industry is notional-isation of the wholesaling function..     This by itself willnot prove a remedy and full development and reorganisation ofthe industry at the ports of landing must first be accomplishedif full benefit is to be derived from the course proposed.13. The Minister of Pood has accused us of trying tocreate a monopoly from which new entrants would be excluded,and he professes groat concern for the interest of the smallman&apos;.      He overlooks the fact that a neor water trawler nowcosts some  30,000,  and a distant water trawler  100,000.The small man is no longer able to hove such vessels builtas is proved by the details of the building programme already^referred to in paragraph 5*      On the other hand,  the Ministerof Pood completely ignores the provision qf the InshorePishing Industry, Act, which enables the Fisheries ministers to make grants up to one-third of the cost of new vessels,  andin addition loans up to 562/3  per cent,  of the cost, thusenabling the small man to enter the industry. &apos;   There orealso the provisions of the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1938, whichwe propose to revise and extend&apos;, regarding co-operativeschemes for inshore fishermen,  as we believe that by thedevelopment of such schemes and the assistance which ,a production Board can render to inshore-fishermen, a healthydevelopment of the industry will take place.11+. &apos;0u&quot;r proposal drastically to reduce the number oftrawler owners,  processing and coastal wholesale merchants,was not made with &quot;the obvious intention of reducingcompetitive pressure&quot;, but was made in the light of the fact .that there are too many owners of single vessels in the trawlerindustry who can never h:;pe -toe earn enough to replace theirvessels, many1of which,  sport from gross inefficiency esfishing units, have accommodation for crews which ought not tobe permitted.15. As regards this year&apos;s experience it will be recalled that the Minister of Pood wished to remove maximum prices inApril last.      We successfully protested against this and pointed out that in our.view there would be many occasions onwhich fish would be in short supply and prices would soar ifnot controlled.      Events hove justified our protest.16. We are accused of predicting a glut which did not materialise.      Supplies in 19h7 were affected by abnormalconditions in distant waters, where extraordinarily largequantities of small fish were taken and in many cases half ofthe catches had to be returned to the sea.      There was also on unprecedented scarcity of.sizeable fish on the usual,fishing grounds,  consequently distant water vessels had tosoend more time in searching for fish.      In the first nine months of 1 9I+6 1,1+22 voyages yielded h, 130,000 cwts., whereas
in the. first nine months of 1947,  2,.1-1+1 voyages yielded only.082,000 cwts.  or 62 per ce.nt.  of the capacity of the:vessels employed.17. We convinced a sub-committee of the Lord presidents committee that if no action is token the existence of the near and middle water and the -inshore fisheries will be threatened,. and a useful reserve of boats and.men for naval purposes willbe squandered.      The consumers will be faced by the disappearance of the varieties and high quality fish landed by these vessels and they will have to depend on an unrelieved diet of inferiorquality cod, haddock and plaice landed from distant waters,unless large sums are spent on buying foreign fish.     Webelieve that a type of vessel can be evolved and built whichcan fish the near and middle waters and compete v/ith the&apos;distant water vessels.      We are also convinced that    the lattermust undergo modifications to enable them to undertake freezingand.processing at sea and to exploit new fishing areas toensure our fish supplies,  in case stocks in the present areas should fail.      This is especially important as our scientiststell us that they have some doubts as to the permanancy ofthe fertility of the distant waters.18. The sub-committee (L.P.(47) 129 of 23rd- July,  1947)reported as follows:-11 (1)    We recommend that the request of the FisheriesMinisters for legislation to make possibleintervention by the Government to reform the fishing industry should be accepted.(2)    We recommend that the reform of the fishing industry should be-carried out by two Boards,  the ProductionBoard responsible to the Fisheries Ministers,  and,a Distribution Board responsible to the Ministerof Pood. /(3)    We have taken note that the Fisheries Ministersaccept the report of the&apos; Official Committee onRestrictive Practices by Supervisory Boards(Gen.  177/6),  and we agree that safeguards tomeet the points there made should be incorporated in the necessary legislation.The Minister of Food dissented from these conclusions.&quot;&apos;19. These recommendations were approved by. the lord presidents Committee on 12th August, .1947,   (L.P. (47)  25thMeeting, Minute 3).20. The proposal that there should be a DistributionBoard was not originally made by the,Fisheries Ministers andthe Minister of Food now states that he finds difficulty inseeing what useful functions the Ministry of Food and theDistribution Board would perform.      Under our proposals our responsibility and that of the Production Board would cease        \-at the point when fish is ready for despatch from the ports.&quot;It is for the Minister of Food to say how its subsequentdistribution should be dealt with.     We do submit, however,  that -there is much room for improvement of the whole distributivesystem.
21. Several committees and commissions have drawn -attention to, the need for the re-organisation pnd developmentof the fishing industry.      Now that home produced fish playssuch an important part in feeding the people and the demand is likely to be maintained,, it is more than/ever, necessaryto ensure that the.productive machine is geared to maximum production, with the minimum call on labour resources.We invite our&apos; colleagues,  therefore, to endorseour proposals..T.W.a.w.11th December, 1 947*
