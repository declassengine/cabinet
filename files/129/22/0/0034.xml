t    174(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(47) 3248th December,  1947.COPY NO.3^CABINETPOOD prices memorandum by the Chancellor&apos; of the exchequer at their meeting on 27th November (CM. (47) 91stConclusions, Minute 7),  the Cabinet asked me, in consultationwith the Minister of Food, to reconsider, in the light ofthe discussion, the proposals for the reduction of the food subsidies contained in C.P. (47) 312.To implement the policy announced in last month&apos;budget speech, we must henceforward aim at stabilising thetotal of the food subsidies at about  400 millions.      Thepresent estimated total for next year (1948-49) is  450millions,  and- if we are to provide a margin against probable-further increases in buying prices during the year, wecannot; safely consider reducing the subsidy total by lessthan the  70 millions or so previously contemplated.In the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion,  theMinister of Pood and I agree in recommending the Cabinet toadopt the price increases in alternative 2B of Appendix b of CP. (47) 31 2, namely:-saving in a	From an	To an	average of	average ofTea Meat Shell Eggs Bacon Butter .

Theprice increases are more widely -spread;    the increase on teais reduced;    butter and cheese are included.      It remains to beseen whether it will be possible, to link any increase -in the bacon ration with the increase -in price, but in any case this price increase could,  if necessary, be put at the end of thewhole programme.Treasury Chambers,  S.W. 1.*8th December,  1947.
