Table 1 gives some of the more important statistical series on man-power.Between June and September 1947 total employment in manufacturing industries is estimated to have increased by 53,000, while employment in these industries on direct export orders apparently increased over the same period by 194,000, thusindicating a fall in employment on home orders. A similar movement took placein textile employment. The comparative movement may not be so favourable asit looks, as part of the increase shown in employment on export orders may bedue to the increasing care taken by employers to show the full strength of their labour force engaged on export work.2. Table 5 shows that in the third quarter of 1947 the volume of british exports was at 114 per cent, of the 1938 level compared with a target of 140 per cent,for mid-1948 and of 160 per cent, for the end of 1948. A large expansion in exports will be needed to attain the targets and, in the absence of an increasein the productivity of workers, there must also be a rise in the man-power in:   34551   - &apos;      &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;     &apos; b
manufacturing industries.,engaged on export work. How great that rise inemployment will need to be cannot be closely estimated. Employment on export orders in manufacturing industries is already estimated to be over 70 per cent,above the numbers at June 1939. If there were no future increase in productivity and employment were to increase in the same proportion as exports themselves,the rise would have to be of the order of 150,000 workers to attain the mid-1948targets with perhaps a further 250,000 to secure the achievement of the exporttargets set for the end of 1948. In so far as adequate supplies of raw materials and parts can be secured and other bars to increased efficiency removed, the callon man-power will be correspondingly diminished. Failing such an improvementin productivity, supplies to the home market will clearly have to be appreciablycurtailed.Coal Mining3. The number of workers on colliery books has declined from 718,000 inJune to 715,000 on 8th November, 1947, and it appears clear that the economic survey target of 730,000 workers will not be reached by the end of the year.Despite the recent improvement in production, this fall in man-power has disturb-ing implications for the fulfilment of diir obligations to export coal under the marshall plan, for our commercial bargaining power, and consequently for thesupplies we can hope to secure from overseas and the contribution we can make to european recovery.Building and Civil Engineering4. The number of workers in the building and civil engineering tradecontinues to expand, and reached a high level of 1,367,000 at the end of September1947 compared with 1,310,000 at mid-1939. The labour force is, therefore, alreadymuch above the level of 1,300,000 contemplated for the erid of the year. Moreover,the decision to cut the investment programme has considerably reduced the heedfor building labour.Textiles and Cotton Spinning5. Since June 1946 the total number of workers in the textile industrieshas increased from 713,000 to 791,000 at, September 1947, but the level is. stillwell, below the 1,002,000 employed at mid-1939. Between June and September1947 the number employed on direct export orders has apparently risen by 49,000although the total employment has increased by no more than 8,000.6. Table 2 gives figures of employment in certain under-manned industries.In cotton spinning the total labour force has remained throughout the summerat around the level of 144,000 reached in March of this year; compared with139,000 in June 1946. There is evidence, however, that recruitment improved in October, but this may have been an immediate and transient effect of the Controlnf Engagement Order.Production7. Most of the production figures shown in Table 3 reflect in greater or less degree the effect of holidays. A sharp recovery in September was made in theproduction of woven wool fabrics, passenger motor vehicles arid steel. Coaloutput in September and October was disappointing but returns for the last three Weeks have shown progressive increases in output despite reductions in open cast, production, presumably under seasonal influences. For each of the weeks ended 8th and 15th November deep-mined production topped the PrimeMinister&apos;s target of 4 million tons, helped as it has been by the increase in working hours which has, however, still to make its full contribution. Cdalproduction, is, however, subject td seasonal influences and this period of theyear normally sees a high level of output. It remains doubtful how far thepresent high level of steel production can be maintained in face of the shortages of scrap and of pig-irOh. Adequate.supplies of coal and of steel are, of course,a pre-condition of high levels of production and efficient working in a large partof our manufacturing industries, and the present export targets presuppose a level of steel supplies which will be extremely difficult if not impossible to achieve.8. Cotton yarn production suffered a little from holiday interruptions, and production in October shows some improvement and is running at a slightly
399higher rate than a year ago. The increase in output, however, is hot proportionate&apos;to the increase in the labour force arid still leaves the level of output less than three-quarters of the 1938 average.Stocks... 9. Distributed coal stocks at 8th November, 1947, were 16-3 million tons-a figure well above the target of 14;7 million tops for the end of October. ThesBfigures compare with distributed stocks of 10-9 million tons at the end of Octoberayeai&quot; ago. Stocks of coal at electricity undertakings have risen by 8th November,1947,. to 4 - 2 million tons from a low level Of 1-3 million tbhs in January 1947.These figures compare with stocks of 2-3 million tons at the end bf October 1946.Thpiigh coal stocks have made so substantial a recovery since last winter, stocks at 8th November were significantly less than the end-year stocks in any yearBetween 1940 and 1943 inclusive; and the stock forecast for the end of 1947 isonly 1 million tqns higher than at the end of 1945. The figures point to theimportance of a high level Of winter output.10. In the case of scrap and pig-iron the stock position is much less satisfactory. At 1st November, 1947, stocks of scrap were 380,000 tons : since october 1946 there has been a decline from a high level of 687,000 tons, and the forecast for December 1947 is of a further decline to 332,000 tons. Pig-ironstocks at 1st November were down to 475,000 tons from 943,000 tons at August1946. Stocks are now at the lowest figures since statistics were first collected in 1940.11. Other1 ridtable&apos;-falls in stocks have taken place in canned meat and motor spirit but the action taken to increase stocks of softwood has broughtabout a sharp improvement. Canned meat stocks are forecast to rise sharplyby December.Overseas Economic Position12. In terms of value, United Kingdom exports in October were at a highermonthly rate than has yet been attained except in the record month of July1947. In terms of the volume index based on 1938, the provisional October figure is 120 per cent., compared with 126 for July 1947, 112 for January 1947 and121 for July 1946.13. Table 5; shows exports by destination and imports by sources. even allowing for the fact that imports are given c.i.f. and exports f.o.b., it will beseen that bur trade with the Western Hemisphere shows a large and increasing-adverse balance on visible account. Compared with June of last year, exportsto the Western Hemisphere in the good month of Jlily 1947 had risen by almost 7 million a month while imports had increased by nearly  31 million a month.14. An important cause of this increasing adverse balance is to be found inthe disparate movement of import and export prices. Between July of last yearand August 1947 import prices have risen by almost 24 per cent., while export prices have risen by no more than 18 per cent In recent months, however, therehas been a slight improvement in our favour. With the sterling area, dtlr visibletrade has been broadly in balance during the course of this year. With othercountries (other than the Western hemisphere) we had until August Of this yeara favourable balance and this appears likely to be resumed.15. Table 6 shows the progress being made and still to be made by variousgroups of exports towards the attainment of present targets. It will be seen thata very substantial increase in the volume of many df bur exports is expected. Inthe third quarter of 1947, exports of textile manufactures were at the rate df93 per cent, of the level Obtained in the fourth quarter of 1946, while exporttargets for the middle of 1948 demand that this level should be raised to 127 percent. Similarly, for machinery, an increase in the level of exports is requiredwhich will raise the volume index (the fourth quarter of i946 ^ 100) from114 to 151, for vehicles from 116 to 147, and for chemicals and drugs, &amp;c., from95 to 117. For iron and steel and paper, cardboard, &amp;c.,. the levels attained in thethird quarter of 1947 were in excess of the mid-1948 target. The explanation inthe case of iron and steel is to be found in a deliberately modest export targetwhich will assist in providing the necessary materials for fabricated exports.16. One important uncertainty&apos; which faces the country in its efforts to meetbalance of payment difficulties is the future movement of export prices relative
to the prices of imports. As indicated by the index of average values* there has,since 1938, been a deterioration in the terms of trade of about 15 per cent. Inthe future we must push exports into new markets, which will tend to our disadvantage : against this we can hope for some fall in commodity prices from present high levels.17. It will be seen from Table 4 that our monetary reserves (including theunused portions of the United States and Canadian credits) fell by some 938 million between October 1946 and October 1947. This is after takingcredit for the drawing of  45 million in United States dollars since Septemberfrom the International Monetary Fund. In the first quarter of this year, ifthe  50 million gold subscription to the International Monetary Fund is excluded, the drain ran at almost  60 million a month, in the second quarter at 80 million a month, and in the months of July and August (prior to the suspension-sipn of convertibility) at  145 million a month. Since August, the rate of drainhas now reached a level below  60 million a month, though it is still somewhatabove the rate to which the drain must be reduced if the target figure for our reserves at the end of this year is to be achieved.The Drain on Reserves^1947AprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctober ...  million77-583-481 0133-5155-492-867 1f The 1948 target is an average of  25 million a month.$ Including drawings of  14-9 and  29-8 million from the International Monetary Fund.Since the suspension of convertibility, the decline in the balances of non-sterling area countries has been at least temporarily checked, while the decline in sterling area balances has been considerably slowed down.Prices and Finance18. Apart from the prices of imports and exports there is little noteworthyabout the other prices and finance statistics. Small savings have been makinga disappointing snowing during the second half of this year. Wage rates continueto rise, naving moved from 163/164 per cent, of September 1939 at the beginningof September last year to 169 this September.Transport19. Wagon production in September was considerably better than in thetwo previous months and was the highest reached this year, though considerably below the best months of 1946. Of the total production, about one-seventh wasmade for export. The number of main-line locomotives produced in september was substantially below the best months of last year. Of 58 locomotives produced,22 were for export.20. The October figures show that after a long decline there has occurredso modest improvement in the number of railway wagons available for use. Thetotal stock continues to fall, but the reduction in the number under or awaitingrepair has improved availability. Compared with October 1946, however,available wagons are down by 55,000. The fact that the total stock of wagonsfalls despite the monthly increments from production indicates the 5 effect ofscrapping old or otherwise unrepairable wagons. As the stock of wagons ages,it is to be expected that scrapping will increase and greater monthly incrementsof production will be needed to maintain the fleet at a given level., ISth November, 1947* Not shown in tables.
