SECRET- ..... - Copy No.   3CP.(47)307   *; &quot;   &apos;       . &apos; &apos;    &apos;14th November, 1947. :  -  -.  -CABINETIMPERIAL WAR GRAVES COMMISSION-TERMINAL date for RESPONSIBILITYMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARIntroduction1. The Imperial War Graves Commission has asked me, as its Chairman, to obtain theviews of the British Government regarding the date for the termination of the war for thepurposes of the Commission^ duties and powers.Background ,2. After the first world war. the official date for the end of the war for the purposes&quot;of provisions relating to the end of the war in Acts of Parliament, Orders in Council orProclamations, and, unless the context otherwise required, in any contract, deed or other instrument was, in accordance with the Termination of the War (Definition) Act, 1918, fixed by Order in Council. The date&apos;fixed was 31st August, 1921. From that date, therefore, theCommission ceased to be responsible for the permanent maintenance of the graves ofmembers of His Majesty&apos;s Forces who died on active service thereafter.3. At the beginning of the second world war the Commission was given an extension ofits charter to cover this war. It is now anxious that a new terminal date should be fixed inorder that administrative and financial arrangements may be made accordingly.4. On this occasion there has been no Act of Parliament corresponding to theTermination of the War (Definition) Act, 1918. Some Acts of Parliament passed during thewar provide for Orders in Council to be made under them in due course, prescribing a date as the end of the emergency for the purposes of the particular Act, and this procedure hasalready been followed to fix a terminal date in at least one case, viz., the Treason Act, 1940.I understand that in the absence of a general Act or Order in Council as in iqi&apos;8-21,there is no reason why whatever date is considered suitable should not be fixed for thetermination of &quot; the present war &quot; for the purposes of the I.W.G.C. Charter.5. In 1945 the Government, in conjunction with all Dominion Governments, decidedthat the repatriation of those who died during the war could not be permitted. A statement to this effect was issued to the Press by the Imperial War Graves Commission in October,1945. &apos;Proposal6. The Commission has suggested that a convenient terminal date would be 31stDecember, 1947. This date is suitable from my point of view. 1 have consulted the FirstLord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air ; both agree to 31st December, 1947.7. After the terminal date a current burial will be dealt with under the normal peace-timeprocedure whereby Service personnel who die overseas are buried in Service cemeteries orplots. It is proposed that the ban on repatriation should then cease and that the next ofkin of those dying after the appointed day should be entitled to arrange for repatriation ifthey so wish and provided they assume full responsibility for all matters in connection with it, including finance.The same situation arose in 1921, when the transition from the war to the peace systemtook place without difficulty, &apos; -.8. The Commission has pointed out that the selection of the terminal date is a matter for the decision of each individual Government concerned within the Commonwealth. Theyhave made similar approaches to these Governments, all of whom have now agreed to31st December, 1947.Printed for the Cabinet, November, 1947 - - --Op y* \_.---------------------
Recommendation;-&quot;   q. I invite the Cabinet (a) to agree that&apos; the responsibility of the Imperial War Graves Commission, for themaintenance of the graves of members of the British Forces who died after31st December, 1947, shall cease from that date.(b) to empower the Imperial War Graves Commission to seek^ a supplemental charterfrom His Majesty fixing this date.(c) to agree that upon receipt of the charter the Commission should make a public announcement in the names of the participating Governments.(d) to agree that the repatriation ban shall no longer apply to British deaths occurringafter 31st December, 1947, and that this decision should be made known in the public announcement by the Imperial War Graves Commission referred to in (c) above.&apos; .   &apos; .
