INTERIM REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY INTO the tudor AIRCRAFT - PROPOSED PRESENTATION TO PARLIAMENT- AS WHITE PAPERJoint Memorandum by the Minister of Supply and theMinister of Civil AviationCOPY NO.On 18th September, 1947,  the B.B.C.  announced thatthe B.O.A.C. had decided that the Tudor I fleet would not beused for passenger traffic but would be converted to freightcarriers or used for experimental work with jet engines.This report was repeated in certain newspapers on 19&quot;thSeptember.      Oh 22nd September Sir Roy Dobson, managing director of A.V. Roe &amp; Co. Ltd., manufacturers -of the aircraft,issued to the Press a strongly worded statement summarising the history of the&apos;aircraft from the manufacturers&apos; point off-&apos;view-and severely criticising B.O.A.C  for frequently - changingtheir requirements and delaying production of the aircraft byasking for an unreasonable number of modifications.9     He askedfor a public enquiry.      B.O.A.C  issued a denial of theseallegations shortly afterwards and the Board welcomedSir Roy Dobson&apos;s proposal for a public enquiry.2. The then Minister of Supply decided on&apos; 27th September,with the agreement of the Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Civil Aviation (in the&quot;absence of the Minister),that, in the interests of British Civil Aviation there should bea full and impartial enquiry into ^he development and productionof Tudor aircraft for the British Airways Corporations.      ACommittee was accordingly appointed under the Chairmanship ofAir Chief Marshal Sir Christopher L. Courtney to undertake this enquiry, the other members being as follows:-Mr. James MouldMr. J. J. TaylorMr.  George Wansbrough.The Committee were to report to the Minister of Supply andwere invited to include recommendations in their report ifthey so desired.3.     &apos;      - An interim report dealing with the Tudor Mark I was submitted on 11th December,  19h7,  and a copy is attached here to.     The conclusions and recommendations are summarised in paragraphs 129 and 130 o.n&apos;poges 26 and 27 of the Report.
207U. Keen interest is &quot;being shown in Parliament and inthe Press as to the outcome of the Oommittee&apos;s deliberationsand,  in our view,  the Report should be.presented to parliament at once as a White Paper without accompanying observationsby the Government and without waiting until decisions havebeen taken as to the action which is to follow.      Time will clearly be required for detailed consideration of the Report,and, in particular, of the recommendations which theCommittee have made, and pressure for publication will becomeirresistible.5. The approval of the Cabinet is accordingly sought to present the Report, to Parliament as a White Paperimmediately., G.R. S.N.  of C.11th December, 19h&apos;7.

aThe Right Hon. George Strauss, M.P., 11th December, 1947. &apos;Minister of Supply.Sir,Wk were appointed by your predecessor on 27th September, 1947, as aCommittee of Inquiry with the following terms of reference:--&quot; To enquire into the development and production of Tudor aircraft for the British Airways Corporations and to report their findings to the&amp;.     Minister of Supply.&quot;&apos;-&quot;    We have understood our functions to be those of a &quot; fact finding &quot; body.In the course of our work we have had to enquire into matters of a highlytechnical nature, but we have obtained all the technical assistance were quired from the explanatory documents submitted to us and from theexpositions of witnesses who appeared before us.Over a wide area there was general correspondence between the viewsof the various witnesses on technical matters, but in some cases opposingopinions were expressed to us. Where the issues bore on our conclusionswe had to form the best judgments we could, but we do not feel that theserepresent such essential links in the chain of reasoning leading to our conclu-sions that the latter would be invalidated if we had taken a different view.In view of the circumstances which gave rise to the- enquiry, we have thought it right to concentrate in the first place on the development and production of the Tudor I type, and, accordingly this report deals exclusivelywith that aircraft. We hope to submit a further report at an early datedealing with the other marks.We have invited witnesses from all the. organisations which played a partin the development of the aircraft to give evidence, and we are satisfiedthat we have obtained all the information necessary to enable us to forma proper judgment on the matters remitted to us. In Appendix A we setout the names of those who appeared before us.We have also inspeoted all the various marks of the Tudor aircraft at thepremises of the constructors and have made flights in some of them.We should like to take the opportunity of acknowledging the servicesof our Secretary and Assistant Secretary. Mr. J&quot;. A. Drew has displayedqualities of tact, patience and assiduity, without which we should have found it difficult to conduct our enquiry, while Miss E. M. Brown has broughtto our aid a wealth of professional knowledge&apos; which has greatly lightenedour task.  We are, indeed, grateful to them both.We are, Sir,Your obedient Servants,C. L.

ReportPART I.-HISTORY OF THE TUDOR I AIRCRAFTEarly History1. At the beginning of 1943 the position of civil aviation came underreview by the Brabazon Committee. To meet the post-war situation they recommended the construction of certain fundamentally new types of aircraft^1) but since it would be some years before production of them could be in full swing they proposed that the gap between the end of the^war. and their appearance should be filled with &quot; conversion &quot; types based on existing bomber designs. .- 2. In the autumn of 1943 there were discussions on the subject of aircraft for the North Atlantic route between A. V. Roe &amp; Co., Ltd. and Canadianinterests. As a result the firm evolved the project of converting theLancaster IV bomber (later known as the Lincoln) for use as a civil aircraft on this route, by substituting a pressurised fuselage of circular section forthe existing rectangular fuselage. From this proposal eventually developed the Tudor I.3. On 18th October, 1943, A. V. Roe&apos;s proposals came before a meetingheld by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Air and attended by the Chairman of B.O.A.C. The meeting was favourably impressed&apos;byA. V. Roe&apos;s proposition and decided to refer it to the Brabazon Committeefor their views.4. We include at Appendix B, extracts from the record of the meetingof 18th October and from Lord Brabazon&apos;s letter of 25th October, 1943,conveying the support of his Committee for the proposals.5. A. V. Roe, Ltd., began design studies of the aircraft towards theend of 1943, in consultation with the Ministry of Supply, (2) and the firstspecification (No. 29/43, Issue 1) was issued on 10th March, 1944, after discussion between all concerned, including B:O.A.C.6.   This specification laid down the following requirements :  Payload    ...     ...      ...      ...- 8,760 lb. minimum.All up weight   ...      ...      ... 72,000 lb.Still air range ...      ...      ...   4,000 statute miles.Cruising speed and height ... 235 m.p.h. at 25,000 ft. with each1 engine developing an average of625 B.H.P.The fuselage was to be designed so as to be capable of pressurisationand the passenger space was to be furnished for 12 sleeping passengers.7. This latter provision was inserted to meet the express wish of.O.A.C., who felt that this arrangement would enable the aircraft to attract0) Three entirely new types were proposed for the North Atlantic route, viz.,tho Brabazon types&apos; I, III A and IV. The first was to be a very large aircraftsuitable for non-stop operation between London and New York, and the otneitwo rather smaller types (to be produced before the Type I) for use on astopping service on the North Atlantic routes. The programme for theproduction of these aircraft was necessarily completely speculative, but broadly the Committee felt that the Brabazon Type III A should be available for operation in 1948, and the Brabazon Types I and IV in 1949 or 1950. Thus, the conversiontypes would have to fill a gap which would extend at least until the end of 1948.(2) For the sake of simplicity we have referred throughout to the Ministry ofSupply, which took over the functions of tho Ministry of Aircraft Production on1st April, 1946.
passengers by providing greater comfort than the United States type (the. 54A) with which it was thought at that time it would have to compete.8. A second version of the specification was issued in July 1945. Thechief variation from Issue 1 was an increase in the payload to 5,500 lb.,which was made at the suggestion of A. V. Eoe, Ltd., who had receivedencouraging reports about the fuel consumption to be expected from the engines. (3)9. Detailed design work was not started until about June 1944, owingto the pressure of military demands, but by August 1944 a full-scale mock-upfuselage was available for inspection by the Ministry of Supply and B.O.A.C.The layout of the passenger accommodation was criticised by the Gorpora-tion&apos;s representatives, who considered that the amount of space providedwas insufficient. Accordingly another mock-up . with substantially largerdimensions was put in hand. Various changes to this mock-up were madein further discussion with B.O.A.C., and subject to some further changesit was approved by the Corporation^ representatives in February 1945.Production Arrangements, 10. The first contract for the production of two prototypes of the tudor I to Specification 29/43 (Issue 1) was placed in September 1944.This was followed on 1st November, 1944, by a contract for fourteen produc-tion Tudor I aircraft (increased in April 1945 to twenty), which was placed by the Ministry of Supply acting as agents for the Civil Aviation Depart-nient of the Air Ministry.^1) The -number of aircraft ordered was based only.O.A.C.&apos;s estimate of their requirements but, although it appears to haveheen tacitly understood that liability would ultimately -fall on the Cerpora-tion, no formal agreement was recorded defining the Corporation&apos;^ positionin the transaction as the ultimate customer. This, it was explained to us,was due to the fact that at that time the Corporation was not operating as acommercial organisation capable of exercising the normal functions of management/by virtue of an Order made in April 1940, placing the organisa-tion at the disposal of the Secretary&apos; of State for Air.-11.&apos; The first official production programme issued by the Ministry ofSupply in October 1944 envisaged the completion of the first production air-craft in March 1945 and of the whole of the initial order for fourteen aircraft by the following August. ...12. There were successive reviews of this programme as design changes,new requirements and production set-backs occurred, and in the result thefirst unequipped and unpressurised prototype flew in June 1945 and the firstproduction aircraft in January 1946.Flight Trials13. The firnvs first impressions of the flying qualities of the prototypeaircraft were favourable, but during subsequent flights defects were discoveredwhich proved much more difficult to overcome than was at first hoped.(3) We have been informed that neither the Ministry of Supply nor A. V. Roeintended the increased payload to form part of the contract. In point of fact the revised specification did become part of the contract, but we do not think that much importance need be attached to the point, since it was clearly understood by all, concerned from the beginning that the payload was to be a minimum of3,760 lb., which would be improved as far as practicable. *(*) The functions of the Civil Aviation Department of the Air Ministry were taken over by the Ministry of Civil Aviation. in.April 1945.
14. As a insult of investigations carried out jointly by the Aircraft and armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down, the RoyalAircraft Establishment and the constructors, a number of alterations were carried out which improved the aircraft sufficiently to enable it to receive alimited (special category) Certificate of Airworthiness in September 1946rtdd a full Certificate in the following November. Thus a period of fifteen months elapsed during which the prototype was under trial andalteration. (The defects and the action taken-to remedy them are described in Appendix G;)Modifications i15. There had been many discussions between A. V. Roe, Ltd., and b.O.A.C. throughout the period of the construction of the prototypes and theproduction aircraft, and although access to the firm had not been completelyfree in the very early stages owing to considerations of war security, by july 1943 B.O.A.C. were free to visit the firm at any time and to put forwardany proposals for modifications they desired.16. The Final Design Conference was held on 12th and 13th february-ary, 1946, at the constructors&apos; works, after the Corporation, the Air Registra-tion Board and other interested organisations had had an opportunity ofinspecting the aircraft in detail.17. As&apos;a result of this inspection, proposals for a total of 357 modifica-tions were tabled&apos; at the Conference, 343 of them by B.O.A.C. Out of this latter total, 123 (of which some were supported by the Air RegistrationBoard on grounds of safety) were regarded by the Corporation as essentialbefore the aircraft could be accepted; of the remainder it was proposed that210 should be incorporated in all aircraft as soon as possible and 10 shouldbe introduced when convenient.18. The Minutes of the Conference contain an important statement ofpolicy by the Chairman (a Ministry of Supply official) defining the responsi-bility of each of the parties concerned in regard to delays in production and additional cost incurred by the incorporation of modifications, viz.:  &quot; . . . . the general policy is that the operators&quot; are to have what they- want. From this it follows that operators&apos; requirements as such are nota matter for debate, as clearly only the operators can decide what they themselves want. .... The firm are to do all they can to meet the operators&apos; requirements, but both the firm and the Ministry of aircraft production are in duty bound to warn the Ministry of Civil Aviation and. the operators if there is serious penalty in either cost or delay in meetingrequirements; thereafter it is entirely the responsibility of the Ministryof Civil Aviation and the operators between them to decide the relative importance.&quot;19. In March 1946 the Ministry of Civil Aviation informed the con-instructors and the Corporation that only those modifications considered essential by the Air Registration Board were to be incorporated on theproduction line, all other modifications being made after completion of theaircraft.20. At a meeting of the newly formed Civil Aircraft Modifications Com-mittee of the Ministry of Supply held on 7th and 8th March, 1946, it was stated by the Air Registration Board that 41 of the &quot;essential&quot; modffiea-modifications,were required on grounds of safety, the most important, being theintroduction of a strengthened undercarriage, improvements to the fire-precaution arrangements and to the heating of the oil system. It was clearthat some months would be required for the completion of the work
involved on the undercarriage. and the constructors estimated that theretoamiiigf^-^&amp;tidifi^tions -could .be- dealt with satisfactorily within thisperiod. In view of this it was agreed that a further batch, which, although not pressed by the Air Registration Board on grounds of safety, were regarded by the Corporation as essential, might be incorporated, provided they - could be completed within the period required for the completion ofthe Air Registration Board&apos;s requirements; in effect in the period needed tomake the new undercarriage available.21. After this meeting the Corporation were informed by the Ministerof Civil Aviation that the introduction of modifications not considered essential by the Air Registration Board should be restricted to those whichcould be installed during the period necessary to introduce the strengthenedundercarriage, and that the introduction of the Tudor I into service mustnot be delayed by further modifications.22. The incorporation of the essential modifications involved a delay inthe then current production programme, and the constructors produced a revised programme in March 1946, under which the first production aircraft would be. completed in April 1946 and the whole order of twenty by october 1946.Preparations for Service23. While the work; of testing the prototype and building the production aircraft was going on, the ^Corporation were making preliminary arrange-ments for the introduction of the Tudor into service. Thus, five Captainsfrom the North Atlantic Line were sent to the Corporation^ Training Schdolat Aldermaston in October 1946 for a course of instruction in the operationof the aircraft, but after receiving preliminary ground. training they were returned to their Line in December 1946 because, it is stated by the Gorpora-tion; ho aircraft were available for flying training on the North atlantic route.24. Arrangements were also put in hand by the Corporation for theorganisation of a maintenance base for Tudor aircraft at Ringway and of engineering and pressurisation courses for ground personnel.25. The Corporation took delivery of an aircraft (G-AGRE) on2f6tih September, 1946,. for the purpose Of familiarising their DevelopmentPlight, personnel with the characteristics and handling features of theTVdof I type, prior to the impending loan of a fully representative aircraft for service trials. This aircraft&apos;s total flying time, until it was returned bythe-Corporation five months later, was 83 hours.26. The second aircraft (G-AGRD) was delivered to the corporation on 22nd November, 1946, and a programme of service trials at Cairo, andNairobi was drawn up in consultation with the Ministry of Supply. Thesecovered both tests of the functioning of equipment and the determination ofrange and operational characteristics as a preliminary to North Atlanticservice trials, which the Corporation were unwilling to undertake in winterconditions until further experience of the type had been gained. TheMinistry of Supply&apos;s main interest in the trials was to establish take-off per-formance at high altitude in the tropics as a check on the performance of the tudor II type which the Tudor I closely resembled in this respect.27. The aircraft left the United Kingdom on 16th December, 1946, and returned on 17th January, 1947. Both A. V. Roe, Ltd., and Rolls Royce&apos;,Ltd., were represented on the trials by observers, and a pilot and observerfrom Boscombe Down also accompanied the party.
:.. 28. In.a letter to the Ministry of civil  Aviation dated 30th January,1947, the Corporation made a preliminary report on the results of these trials(see paragraph 76 and Appendix.G). They stated that they did not regard the Tudor I type as airworthy at present and that its deficiency in per-formance effectively prevented it from operating the North Atlantic.29. The points of criticism made in the report of the Nairobi trials hadnil been noted during the earlier trials of the Tudor I, but as they now appeared to be of a much more serious nature, at any rate on this particularaircraft, than those earlier trials had indicated, arrangements were madefor an intensive programme of development work to ascertain the funda--,mental reasons for the troubles. 430. The firm has now completed a number of changes in the aircraft which it is hoped will remove these defects and ensure the recovery ofthe range required by the specification. This fully modified aircraft is dueto go to Boscpmbe Down shortly for further tests.Rejection of the Aircraft31. On 11th April, 1947, the Corporation addressed a letter to theMinistry of Civil Aviation in which they stated that irrespective of possible improvements in the aircraft and its performance they no longer requiredit for service. In view of its importance we quote the letter in full inAppendix D.32. To bring this outline of the history of the aircraft up to date it isonly necessary to add that the. Corporation, in answer to a letter from theMinistry of Civil Aviation requesting them to give further consideration tothe use of the Tudor I on the North Atlantic, informed the Department on28th August, 1947, that a complete review of the Corporation^ aircraft pro-gramme was then in course of preparation and that until the Board of theCorporation had reached its conclusions on the matter it would be premature to deal separately with the Tudor I.PART II.-THE  NATURE OP THE TUDOR I PROJECT33. It is clear from the early history of the project that it was never,thought that the Tudor I would be an economic aircraft in the sense thatit would make a profit on the North Atlantic route. Ii, however, it could,in the period immediately, following the war, offer regularity and a degreeof comfort and general convenience which would compare favourably withcompetitive United States services, it would maintain the prestige of Britishoperators and would provide practical experience which would be of immensevalue to the constructors and to operators concerned with the new civil typesplanned to follow.34. For the full realisation of these benefits, however, it was essentialthat the Tudor I aircraft should be got into operation at the start of the interim period for which they were intended, in replacement of Liberatorsand Boeing flying-boats which were approaching the end of their useful life.This interim period was envisaged as commencing in the Spring of 1946 and extending to the end of 1948 or possibly into 1949, when it was hoped thatthe first of its successors recommended by the Brabazon Committee wouldbe in service (see footnote to paragraph 1).35. The desire to provide a high standard of passenger comfort inthe Tudor I operating on the North Atlantic imposed several design limita-tions.   First, in order to provide ample accommodation for each passenger,
a rather uneconomic use of the available space was necessitated.. Secondly,in order to ensure comfort and regularity in flight over the North Atlanticit was essential that the aircraft should be capable of operation at highaltitudes above the bad weather zone without resort to the use of oxygen.This involved pressurisation of the fuselage, and although some development work of this kind had been done in connection with military aircraft, therewas no body of knowledge in this country applicable to the problems pre-sented by the pressurisation of large civil fuselages. The practical problems connected with this field of development had, therefore, to be explored...almost de novo.P 36. Nevertheless, a strict time schedule had to be met and it was thiswhich recommended the proposal to adapt a proved military type of aircraft to civil use. Thus it was thought that aerodynamic problems would beobviated and design, development and production expedited if a new fuselage,adapted for pressurisation, were incorporated in an aircraft which embodiedthe wing structure, undercarriage and other components of the Lancaster IV(Lincoln).37.: In point of fact, however, as work progressed the project movedfurther and further away from this conception.. Apart from the larger fuse-lage necessitated by B.O.A.C.&apos;s requirements, the designer decided to incorporate a single fin and rudder in place of the double fin and rudder fitted to all marks of the Lancaster. Later, in the course of trials of the prototype,further extensive changes were found to be necessary; the fin and rudder hadto be redesigned; a modified tail plane had to be fitted; the Lincoln typeundercarriage had first to be strengthened to meet the requirements of theAir Registration Board, and later shortened to overcome other difficulties;improved engines have been fitted and the wings have had to be modified to accommodate increased fuel tankage. In effect almost every major feature of the aircraft as originally conceived has undergone some change.38. In November 1943 it had been thought that the first prototypewould be flying a year later and that a number of production aircraft wouldbecome available for service within eighteen months. In fact, design workdid not begin until June 1944, but it was still- contemplated as late asOctober 1944 that the first production aircraft would be completed inMarch 1945 and the whole of the order for fourteen aircaft in the followingAugust.39. In view of the major changes which had been decided upon by october 1944 (single fin and rudder and larger fuselage), this production programme seems to us to have been an over-optimistic one, even taking intoaccount the war-time tempo of the industry and the remarkable productionrecord of the firm. We are supported in this conclusion by the views of anumber of witnesses with experience of aircraft design and production, whoare in general agreement that a total period of eighteen or twenty monthswas altogether inadequate for completing a project of this magnitude;particularly in view of the fundamental changes which were beginning tocome forward.40. In fact, the total period which has elapsed between the start of design work in June 1944 and the completion of the fully modified aircraftabout to be tested at Boscombe Down is. 3^ years. Although this is almost exactly twice as long as the original forecast, we venture the opinion that it isnot an over-long period for the development of a new type, for in effect this is what the Tudor I has become.41. . In the light of the factors discussed above, we have attempted to isolate the conditions which it was essential should be fulfilled in the34623 c*

Secondly,in order to ensure comfort and regularity in flight over the North Atlanticit was essential that the aircraft should be capable of operation at highaltitudes above the bad weather zone without resort to the use of oxygen.This involved pressurisation of the fuselage, and although some development work of this kind had been done in connection with military aircraft, therewas no body of knowledge in this country applicable to the problems pre-sented by the pressurisation of large civil fuselages. The practical problems connected with this field of development had, therefore, to be explored,.almost de novo.^&apos; 36. Nevertheless, a strict time schedule had to be met and it was thiswhich recommended the proposal to adapt a proved military type of aircraft. to civil use. Thus it was thought that aerodynamic problems would beobviated and design, development and production expedited if a new fuselage,adapted for pressurisation, were incorporated in an aircraft which embodiedthe wing structure, undercarriage and other components of the Lancaster IV(Lincoln).37. In point of fact, however, as work progressed the project movedfurther and further away from this conception. Apart from the larger fuse-lage necessitated by B.O.A.C.&apos;s requirements, the designer decided to incorporate a single fin and rudder in place of the double fin and rudder fitted to all marks of the Lancaster. Later, in the course of trials of.the prototype,further extensive changes were found to be necessary; the fin and rudder hadto be redesigned; a modified tail plane had to be fitted; the Lincoln typeundercarriage had first to be strengthened to meet the requirements of theAir Registration Board, and later shortened to overcome other difficulties;improved engines have been fitted and the wings have had to be modified to accommodate increased fuel tankage. In effect almost every.major feature of the aircraft as originally conceived has undergone some change.38. In November 1943 it had been thought that the first prototypewould be flying a year later and that a number of production aircraft wouldbecome available for service within eighteen months. In fact, design workdid not begin until June 1944, but it was still- contemplated as late asOctober 1944 that the first production aircraft would be completed inMarch 1945 and the whole of the order for fourteen aircaft in the followingAugust.39. In view of the major changes which had been decided upon by october 1944 (single fin and rudder and larger fuselage), this production programme seems to us to have been an over-optimistic one, even taking intoaccount the war-time tempo of the industry and the remarkable productionrecord of the firm. We are supported in this conclusion by the views of anumber of witnesses with experience of aircraft design and production, whoare in general agreement that a total period of eighteen or twenty monthswas altogether inadequate for completing a project of this magnitude;particularly in view of the fundamental changes which were beginning tocome forward.40. In fact, the total period which has elapsed between the start of design work in June 1944 and the completion of the fully modified aircraftabout to be tested at Boscombe Down is. 8$ years. Although this is almost exactly twice as long asthe original forecast, we venture the opinion that it isnot an over-long period for the development of a new type, for in effect this is what the Tudor I has become.41. . In the light of the factors discussed above, we have attempted to isolate the conditions which it was essential should be fulfilled in the34623 c*
development of the project if the time schedule was to be met. These seemto us to be the following:  (o) No major unforeseen aerodynamic problems must be encountered inthe basic design and development!(b) There must be complete understanding by each party of the difficulties and requirements of the others and a determination to co-operateeven to the extent of foregoing all requirements, however desirablethey might appear, which were not absolutely essential.(c) If these conditions could not be met there must be a co-ordinatingauthority able and willing throughout to bring about agreement and finality in cases of differences and- constantly to impose upon11all concerned a sense of urgency and drive.Unfortunately none of these conditions was fulfilled, and in the following sections we shall attempt an assessment of. the extent to which thiscontributed, to the delay in the completion of the project!PART III.-DELAYS IN DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTIONEarly Delays42. The fact that, serious.design work did not begin until June 1944 was due to the exigencies of military demands. In December 1943 the Govern-ment had decided that- design work and prototype construction mightproceed, but the firm were then fully occupied on Lancaster/Lincoln design and development work. It was not until October 1945, i.e., after VJ-day,that a high priority was given to the Tudor fpur months after the prototypehad flown. .43. Between June 1944 and June 1945, when the first prototype flew,A. V. Roe, Ltd., were still heavily burdened with important military com-commitments. In particular, a special long-range bomber force was required forthe war in the Far East, and to this over-riding priority had to be given both as regards design and production. The alterations to the fuselage dimensions,called for by B.O.A.C. after their inspection of the mock-up in August 1944,also resulted in some delay. These were the main factors which contributed to the delay of 6 months in the production of the prototype.Aerodynamic Defects;44. the story of the aerodynamic defects and their solution is a longand complex one involving action by the constructors, the Aircraft, and armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down and the RoyalAircraft Establishment at Farnborough over a period of about two years.For the present purpose we propose to deal only with the most importanttroubles which appeared and were investigated in the period betweenJune 1945 when the prototype first flew.and November 1946 when a normalcategory Certificate of Airworthiness was granted to the Tudor I. Thesedefects and the action taken to deal with them are set out in Appendix C.45. While the prototype remained at the firm&apos;s airfield at Woodford,efforts were mainly directed to the improvement of the directional controland the longitudinal stability of the aircraft. The firm&apos;s difficulties in doing this were increased by their desire to comply with new civil airworthinessregulations relating to both these subjects which had been recently issued.They also became aware of certain other aerodynamic troubles, but they didnot regard some of them, notably the tendency of the aircraft, to swingon take off and to bounce on landing, as requiring correction.   They were
if more concerned about thetehdency to tail buffeting, (5) but rather on account.of the relatively high speed at which it occurred than of the buffet itself.They Were also aware that fuel consumption was rather higher than theyhad expected, but they hoped that the range characteristic would be improved by reduction in drag and by the fitting of improved engines(6) for which a lower fuel consumption rate had been forecast by the makers (see Part IV).46.   By the time that the prototype went to Boscombe Down inApril 1946 for official flight trials,(7) directional control had been improved by the fitting of a larger fin and rudder, and longitudinal stability by anjj^increase in.the area of the tailplane.47. These defects and the others to which we have referred were, how-ever, interlinked, and the trials at Boscombe Down showed that much workremained to be done before the aerodynamic qualities and performance ofthe:aircraft could be regarded as satisfactory.48. Until a normal category Certificate of Airworthiness was granted,none of the production aircraft could be put into full operational use, andwe have considered whether the period of about 17 months between thefirst flight of the prototype (June 1945) and the date when the aircraft was granted a normal category Certificate of Airworthiness (November 1946)could have been shortened and the delays in the production programmethereby reduced.49. It has not been suggested to us, nor do we think it likely, that inthe circumstances any time could have been saved between April and november 1946, when the prototype and certain production aircraft wereundergoing trials at Boscombe Down, and the Boyal Aircraft; Establishment,in consultation with the firm, were engaged on research into the defects.50. It seems rather more likely, however, that some time could havebeen saved while the prototype remained at the firm&apos;s airfield. After thefirst few flights it became clear that the troubles were more serious than hadbeen thought at the outset, and it is evident that A. V. Roe, Ltd., were concerned about the length of time being taken to clear them; yet although,in common with all other designers, they were aware that the Ministry&apos;ofSupply&apos;s technical resources were at their disposal, they did not call inthe Royal Aircraft Establishment until November 1945 and then, so far aswe can determine, only on the specific suggestion of the Ministry of Supply.During that month consultations took place with the Royal Aircraft Estab-lishment, culminating in a recommendation by the Establishment that a bigger fin and rudder should be fitted; this was designed and incorporated inthe aircraft in April 1946. , It seems reasonably likely that if the RoyalAircraft Establishment had been consulted earlier, part of the time spenton minor, and as it turned out fruitless, alterations to the tail unit mighthave been saved. &apos;   - *51. The adverse reports made by Boscombe Down on certain features ofthe aircraft, in comparison with the views formed by the firm, were probably due in part to the fact that the full importance ot the defects could not be assessed until the aircraft was flown at its all-up weight. In its trials atWoodford the aircraft could not be flown at a higher gross weight than about(5) Tail buffeting may be described as pulsations of the tailplane caused byirregular air flow from the junction of the wing and body.    s .   -(6) Merlin 150, later known as the Merlin 621.(*) The tests required by the Air Registration Board before a Certificate of airworthiness could be.granted were also carried out at Boscombe Down.34623 c* 2
65,000 lb., owing to the limitations of the airfield, whereas the BoscombeDown trials were conducted at the all-up weight of 80,000 lb. We thinkthat time would have been saved in dealing with some at least of the troublesif trials at the all-up weight had begun earlier, and we understand that theMinistry of Supply have now circularised all designers urging that in thedevelopment of new types flights at the all-up weight should start at as earlya stage as possible.52. There were other factors influencing the firnVs attitude to the aero-dynamic faults. First there was a natural reluctance to do anything whichwould involve major redesign, and in so set back production, which led themjto try every possible palliative in the hope of avoiding serious design changes.Secondly, in common with all other constructors in this country, they had had no recent experience of building large civil aircraft, and it would be reasonable for them, particularly in view of their success in the constructionof large bombers, to judge the Tudor by the standards which they had sosuccessfully maintained in that field.53. To sum up, we feel that if the assistance of the Royal aircraft establishment had been called in earlier, the period occupied by the firm&apos;strials might have been considerably curtailed, and that if the aircraft hadbeen flown at the full all-up weight sooner, all the defects might have cometo light at an earlier stage with consequent acceleration of the action takento overcome them (see paragraph 91).54. Before we leave the subject we feel that we should make it clearthat no suggestion has been made that there was any unsoundness - iii the basic design of the aircraft. We venture to think, however, that it was an error, in a stop-gap type, to have increased the risk of aerodynamictroubles by abandoning the double fin and rudder, which had been thoroughlyproved on the Lancaster: apart from this, none of the defects called for major redesign.55. We should also like to emphasise that, although time could havebeen saved, we do not regard as excessive a period of about two and a half-years, from the start Of design work to the issue of a full Certificate of airworthiness.Modifications56. In the statement issued to the Press by A. V. Roe on 22nd Septemberit is alleged that the alterations to the aircraft demanded by the corporation have seriously delayed the Tudor production programme. This allegation was repeated to us in the course of our investigation and we have examined thematter carefully. 7     &apos;&quot;57. For the present purpose we include in the category of modificationsnot only the alterations arising out of the Final Design Conference, but also those made before that Conference, which are technically known as designchanges. .58.: It was to be expected that there would be a flow of requests formodifications from a fairly early stage in the aircrafts history, but while this flow would naturally be continuous as the design progressed, it wouldbe reasonable to expect that certain features could be agreed and cleared atthe mock-up stage. Thus, the number of alterations. requested by theCorporation at the first mock-up conference was not excessive, , -but unfortunately they did not represent B.O.A.C.&apos;s final word oh the pointsdiscussed.   The Tudor I mock-ups were unusually detailed, and we think
ISthat it should have been possible for the Corporation to have reached finalityat the mock-up stage in regard to some at least of the features which werein fact altered later.59.   The following are examples of successive changes called for byB.O.A.C. before the Final Conference:  March 1945. Despite previous consultation on the main cabin, B.O.A.O.requested that the cabin windows be lowered 3 to 4 inches. In laterdiscussion the Corporation agreed to accept a lowering of -onlyl-  inches but this involved structural alterations.&apos; August 1945. Windows for the upper bunks which had been made a firm requirement in August 1944 were now to be deleted.September 1945. Despite previous mock-up conferences on the furnish-ing and layout of-the passenger accommodation, a further 32 altera-tions were asked for by the Corporation.August 1944-Marcfe 1946. The pilot&apos;s instrument panel was re-arranged&apos; three times, despite inspection and approval of certain changes at themock-up conference.60. There were also many detailed changes, some of a relatively trivialnature, which, although they did not necessarily involve a great deal of work,nevertheless were a source of irritation, and by their numbers had the effectof delaying more urgent work in the design office.61. There is no doubt that at the outset the constructors were anxiousto meet the needs and wishes of the Corporation, provided that no modifica-tion which was not really justified was introduced if it would delay produc-tion, and that the Corporation made up its mind and adhered to its decisions.As modification succeeded modification, however, the constructors began to form the view that the Project Branch of B.O.A.C. (the branch of theCorporation responsible, for progressing the development of the aircraft) wereunreasonable in their demands, changing them when they were thought tobe settled and, equally important, were asking for modifications which,although desirable from the point of view of operational convenience oramenity, were not essential and could be dispensed with in view of theimportance of the time factor. As a result A. V. Roe, Ltd., tended to developsome resistance to B.O.A,C.&apos;s requests and this led to a deterioration in therelations between the firm and the Corporation.62. We feel that there is some justification for the firm&apos;s complaints onthese scores. There is little doubt that many of the alterations could have been suggested earlier and that a greater degree of finality could havebeen reached on the interior layout of the aircraft at the mock-up confer-ences held in 1944. &apos; -63. So far we have been dealing with the period before the Final Design -Conference in February 1946, when it will be remembered over 300 modifica-tions were tabled by B.O.A.C., of which 123 were regarded as essential.&apos; Wedo not consider this number excessive in the light of experience with other aircraft and in view of the purpose of the Final Design Conference, namely,to obtain from the operators details of the work remaining to be done tomake the type-acceptable. A number of the alterations put forward were,however, of a kind which might have been incorporated at an earlier stage,and this lends support to the view that the relations between the firm andthe Corporation were not as cordial as they should have been to achieve thebest results in the shortest time.
64. The Corporation have justified their action by pointing out that itwas not until shortly before the Final conference i that they had had anopportunity of inspecting a complete aircraft, and that in any case a numberof the more important modifications had been the subject of prior discus-sions with the firm.&apos; 65. Whilst it is no doubt true that there were some features of the air-craft which could not properly be criticised until a complete production aircraft had been inspected in detail, we&apos;do not think this justified the deferment of so many alterations until the Final Conference. Throughoutthe whole period there had been no- practical limitation on the amount of consultation between the firm and B.O.A.C. Indeed, in the last three months&apos;or so of 1945, fifty-nine visits had been paid to the firm&apos;s premises byB.O.A.C. and, in addition, B.O.A.C. had three resident representatives there as well as a Visiting Technical Officer. Moreover, by February 1946, the prototype had been undergoing its flight trials for some eight months andwas, still at Woodford. B.O.A.C.&apos;s representatives could have had access to this aircraft, and even though it was not fully equipped, it,should havebeen possible for them to have gained from it a fairly clear picture of theengineering, and maintenance features of the type.66. Actual contact was therefore not inadequate; indeed, it seems probable that some of the difficulties arose from there being too many repre-sentatives of B.O.A.C. each putting forward suggestions bearing on hisspeciality. In our view, had relations been such as to ensure co-operationbetween the two sides, and had there been adequate co-ordination withinthe Corporation, there was no.reason why finality on many of the alterationscould not have been reached at a much earlier stage,- &apos; 67. It is clear that both the Ministry of Supply.and the Ministry of CivilAviation were concerned at the situation as it was revealed after the FinalConference. The Ministry of Supply have told us that, as agents of theMinistry of Civil Aviation, who were the effective principals in the trahs-actipn, they could have done relatively little beyond pointing out the costof the modifications in terms of money and delay.&quot; This, in fact, was one ofthe purposes of the Civil Aircraft Modifications Committee of the Ministryof Supply, on which both the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the corporation were represented.68. The Ministry of Civil Aviation were in a more difficult position.Under the Civil Aviation Act constituting the Corporations, the department is responsible for the provision of broad policy direction, but is not concernedwith matters of day to day management. Following this division of functionthe Department appears to have considered that dictation to the corporation on matters affecting the commercial and operational features of the aircraft would take it beyond its proper role. Nevertheless, it was important in theinterests of British civil aviation as a whole that the Tudor I should comeinto service quickly, and it was no doubt on this ground that the Departmentinformed B.O.A.C. in March 1946 that no modifications other than those required by the Air Registration Board for safety reasons should be allowedto delay the introduction of the aircraft into service.69. All the various causes of delay are inter-related, and it is impossible,to.assess with any accuracy how much delay was due to modifications intro-duced by:B.O.A.C. It appears to us, however, that while the majority... of.O.A.C.&apos;s requirements were capable of justification in the sense that theyimproved the aircraft, the Corporation^ inability to make final decisions on many of them, and the consequent repeated alterations, were undoubtedly
a cause of delay in the production of the aircraft before the Final Conferencein February 1946.70. After the Final Conference, essential aerodynamic modificationsarising: from the prototype trials&apos;imposed delays on the production of theaircraft. It was these delays that frustrated the attempt made by theMinistry of Civil Aviation to restrict the number of modifications, becausethe time necessary to rectify the aerodynamic trpubles afforded B.O.A.C. theopportunity to press for the remaining modifications requested at the FinalConference. These modifications, therefore, were not of themselves a primarycause of delay, but there is no doubt that they contributed to the successive&apos; set-backs in the production programme by hindering the designer and his staff from concentrating their full attention on the solution of the aerodynamictroubles, and by giving rise to friction between the constructor and theoperator.71. The effect of the lack of finality in B.O.A.C.&apos;s requirements on the enthusiasm of the firm was impressed upon us by the workpeople employed,in the construction of the aircraft. Their representatives explained to us that at the outset there had been an atmosphere of enthusiasm and drivecomparable with that which had animated the works during the peak of.production of the Lancaster. Later, however, a sense of frustration developed,and in some cases earnings declined because repetition work was impossible-.Enthusiasm began to. wane and no doubt the tempo of the work diminishedas a result. ,&apos;72. In the case of the Tudor IV(8) on the other hand, we were told that,although very considerable modifications were introduced, e.g., the lengtheningof the fuselage by nearly 6 feet and the deletion of the flight engineersstation, the workpeople were convinced that British South American Airwayswere determined to put the aircraft into service at the earliest possible moment. The effect was to create a spirit of enthusiasm amongst the work-people, who were prepared to, and did in fact, work for long periods withouta break in order to get the aircraft out quickly. If the same decision anddrive had been apparent on the part of B.O.A.C., we do not doubt that the enthusiasm of the workpeople for the Tudor I would have been maintained.Service Trials... .78. We now turn to a consideration of delays arising after the prototypehad been granted a full Certificate of Airworthiness, with.particular referenceto the Nairobi trials which took place in December 1946 and January 1947.74 It has been suggested in the course of our enquiry that the factthat the trials were carried out in tropical conditions instead of over the north atlantic rendered thern an unfair test of the aircraft&apos;s suitability for itsintended purpose.75. Obviously it would have been better to have carried out trials on. the route for which the aircraft,was intended, but the Corporation felt that untilthe functioning of the equipment had been tested and range and climbcharacteristics determined it would not be safe to conduct trials over theNorth Atlantic, especially in winter. While we believe that B.O.A.C. mighthave gained more flying experience with the type in this country, after thegrant of the special category Certificate of Airworthiness in; September 1946,it is unlikely that enough flying experience could have been gained to justify.; (?) The /version, of the: Tudor I adopted by British South American; airways corporation. . : v
trials on the North Atlantic in winter; and in the circumstances as theyexisted we think that the course adopted was the right one.76. In their letter of 30th January, 1947, to the Ministry of CivilAviation, stating that they did not regard, the Tudor I type as airworthy atpresent or as suitable for operation on the North Atlantic; B.O.A.C.criticised the aircraft under a number of heads, of which the most impor-tant were: (i) Serious tail buffeting, both in cruising flight in rough weather and during the approach to, and climb away from, airfields in tropicalconditions. 4(ii) A serious reduction in range below the specification requirement(about 3,400 instead of 4,000 still air miles).(iii) A bad tendency to swing on take off. .(iv) Serious bounce on landing.77. Although the handling qualities of the type had already been sufficiently improved to satisfy the Air Registration Board that a fullCertificate of Airworthiness could be issued, it was agreed by all concerned that in view of this report an intensive programme of development work should be put in hand to ascertain the fundamental reasons for the troubles.and to find a cure. This covered model tests and flight trials byA. V. Roe, Ltd., Boscombe Down and the Royal Aircraft Establishment,as well as improvements to the power plants by Rolls-Royce (further details are given in Appendix C).78. In February 1947 a Tudor I (G-AGRJ) was lent to British south american Airways Corporation for flight trials. They reported that they considered this aircraft normal for a four-engineed type with a tail wheel,and suitable for operation on their routes.79. It has been stated in evidence before us that the aircraft(G-AGRD) tested at Nairobi exhibited certain defects to a greater degreethan the prototype. The aircraft is sensitive to minor variations in construc-tion .and there seems little doubt that in G-AGRD the &quot; leak &quot;(&apos;) in themain planes and the unevenness of the de-icing strips(10) were pronounced.Moreover, the air conditions during the flights were more turbulent than anythat had been experienced in this country.80. It is also possible, as the firm have maintained, that the tropicalconditions and the high altitude of the airfield at which the trials were con-ducted tended to aggravate the defects, particularly those relating to take-offperformance, and that the results ought not to be regarded as an accurateguide to the performance of the aircraft in the conditions for which it was designed.81. Moreover, representatives of the Ministry of Supply have given theopinion, in evidence before us, that, while G-AGRD itself was unsuitable,in the state in which it went to Nairobi, for passenger operation on the north atlantic, and while improvement of the type as a whole was desirable, the,&quot;(*) The &quot;leak &quot; which was later found to be the cause of the buffeting troubleoccurred at the inboard end of the main plane where there was a small unsealedjoint. This provided a path between the high pressure area below the wing andthe low pressure area above it which resulted in a. disruption of the flow of airover the wing surfaces.(10) This unevenness affected the handling qualities of the aircraft and wasone of the causes of the bad airflow which in turn affected the range. It alsocaused uneven distribution of the de-icing fluid itself.
defects were not such as to preclude the introduction of the Tudor I typeinto service, improvements being incorporated later.&apos; 82. We do not think that B.O.A.C.&apos;s condemnation of the type was justified. The consensus of technical opinion is that the aircraft which went to Nairobi had individual defects, and we think that the Corporation mighthave awaited the results of the technical investigations before expressing their opinion. Indeed, it is noteworthy that at a meeting held inMarch 1947 to consider the programme of development work, the B.O.A.C.representatives stated that if the aircraft could achieve. a range of^approximately 4,000 still air miles with a payload of 4,000 lb. it would beJ&apos; technically suitable &quot; for service on the North Atlantic.83. We do not suggest that the Corporation^ action resulted in delay indealing with the modifications found necessary as a result of the Nairobitrials; it came, however, at an unfortunate time and probably had the effectof exacerbating still further the feeling between the firm and the Corporation.We think that, if B.O.A.C. had been really anxious to put the Tudor I into service, they would have continued with their preparations and could have introduced the aircraft into operation without some, if not all, the improve-inents which could have been incorporated later.Commentary on the Delays84. Although we have necessarily had to devote a good deal of space tothe various delays which occurred, it should not be supposed that these wereunusual. In the present state of aeronautical science there . can be no certainty that a design will be successful until the aircraft has been testedin the air. Almost invariably these tests disclose &quot; teething troubles &quot; of greater or less seriousness and the Tudor I was no exception. We must also make it clear that, although the aerodynamic defects in the Tudorwere the primary cause of delay, none of them was fundamental. Apartfrom the deficiency in range, the most serious defect the tail buffeting was due to a small detail of construction which had given no trouble in the parent Lancaster and which was only discovered after long research.85. The modifications put.forward by B.O.A.C., though not in themselves a primary cause of delay, distracted the attention of A. V. Roe&apos;s design staff and thus contributed to the delay.186. We believe that neither the aerodynamic defects nor the B.O.A.C.modifications would have caused the delay they did if B.O.A.C. and A. V. Roe,Ltd., had worked together with intimate co-operation and understandingas enthusiastic partners. The enthusiasm of the constructors was never in doubt. They should have sought help in their difficulties, e.g., from theRoyal Aircraft Establishment, sooner than they did; and a trusted partner,or for that matter one of the Departments, imbued with the urgency of the project might have so persuaded them. But producer and user were neveron such terms. Formal contacts were adequate, but so far as we can seethere was no trace of that ideal relationship between customer and manu-facturer which can reduce mountains to molehills. We have been told thatthe Operations Branch of B.O.A.C. have not experienced similar difficultiesin their dealings with aircraft firms in regard to modifications of currenttypes. The Tudor I was, however, handled by the Project Branch, whichhad only second-hand contact with the hard realities of commercial opera-tions. It is.perhaps inevitable&apos;that such a branch, in common with similarsections of many other organisations, should, unless firmly controlled fromthe centre, tend to become somewhat unrealistic.
87. In default of close co-operation between user and producer, the delayscould only have been reduced to a minimum if the project.and all concernedwith it had been driven ahead all the time by some central organisation orpreferably by some individual, who felt the dire sense of urgency and was able to impose it on the other parties. It is unfortunate that the two departments felt themselves unable to intervene, the one because, they werein the position of agents and the other because they appear to have felt thatdirect intervention would have involved a derogation of the responsibilities of the Corporation.88. In recording these opinions we must make it clear that we are not^implying any criticism of the Departments concerned. In particular we;must point out that, although the Ministry of Civil Aviation were betterfitted constitutionally to undertake the task of co-ordination and directionthan the Ministry of Supply, they were a new Department and in the latter part of 1945 and the early months of 1946 they were pre-oceupied with thetask of establishing the nationalised Corporations. In these circumstances it is not surprising that consideration of the slow progress of the Tudorand the steps necessary to expedite it should have been given a lower degreeof priority than in retrospect it appears to have deserved.89. The fact -that B.O.A.C. were not themselves the buyers of theaircraft also played its part in causing delay. On the one hand they, werenot subject to the restraining consideration that the cost, direct and indirect,of every modification was to fall on them; on the other, A. V. Roe, Ltd.,could not be certain how far they had to do what B.O.A.C. asked if they felt that their demands were unreasonable.90. Summing up, we consider that the root cause of the trouble lay indefective co-operation between user and producer where there should havebeen single minded concentration on the primary object,-namely to get theaircraft into service as quickly as possible; there was such an effectivedivision of constitutional responsibility among the organisations concerned that each could find unimpeachable reasons for keeping its constructiveactivity within moderate limits; and on none of the parties was there suchclear financial responsibility as would have impelled action. None the less,effective leadership could have come from either of the two Departments,but for reasons which doubtless seemed good at the time, it did not.91. We are prepared to give our view as to the amount of time whichmight have been saved.if B:O.A.C. and A. &quot;V. Roe, Ltd., had worked togetherwith harmony and enthusiasm, whether of their own volition or under leader-ship from official quarters. We think that the prototype might havereceived a Certificate of Airworthiness in the early summer of 1946; that service trials and the training of crews could have been completed by the endof the winter of 1946-47; and that an abundance of flying and intensiveinvestigation at the Royal Aircraft Establishment and elsewhere would haveremedied the aerodynamic defects by the same time. On such a time-tablepassengers might have been carried with fair regularity during the summer of 1947; and any remaining improvements, eg., to range characteristics andde-icing equipment, would have been achieved in time to ensure goodregularity of service in the winter of 1947-48.PART IY. PERFORMANCE VARIATIONS92. Apart from the effects on drag, and hence on range, of the aero-dynamic defects described in Part III and Appendix C,. there has been asubstantial progressive increase in the gross weight of the Tudor I which
has affected its performance; and there is also some evidence that the specificfuel consumption of the engines: is slightly higher than that originallyanticipated by Rolls Royce, Ltd.All-up Weight93. It should be made clear at the outset that the all-up weight of an aircraft is of importance mainly in relation to strength factors, take-offperformance, cruising speed and operating height. It is not the normal practice to lay down the all-up weight in the specification, but to leave it^;o the designer to decide at what all-up&apos; weight the performance requirement?-can be met. The statement of the all-up weight in Issue I of the Tudor ISpecification is therefore unusual and is due to the fact that this was thefirst specification prepared for a post-war civil aircraft when the procedurehad not been established. Nevertheless, the all-up weight of a new type(which.always tends to increase as the design develops) is, of course, carefully watched by the constructor and the Ministry of Supply in order to gaugethe effect on performance.. 94. In the original conception of the Tudor I in December 1943 the gross weight was set at 70,000 lb. and it was expected that a payload of4,340 lb. could be carried for -4,000 still-air miles at a cruising speed of246 miles per hour and a height of 25,000 ft. These figures, were based onthe estimated weights of Lancaster components. The first realistic estimate,however, prepared in June 1944 by the firm after discussion with the Ministryof Supply arid the Corporation, and based on the actual weights of Lincolncomponents, provided for a gross weight of 75,000 lb. This increase resultedin a lowering of the estimated cruising speed to 235 m.p.h., and this in turninvolved an increase in the quantity of fuel required.95.: By May 1946 an increase in the all-up weight to 80,000 lb. hadbeen reported. After that date the all-up weight remained constant, though there were, of course, a number of detailed variations within this total. Thenet effect to date of the various alterations may be assessed by comparing the data supplied by A. V. Roe, Ltd., in June 1944 with their figures asat October 1947 for G-^AGRI, the fully modified aircraft. This comparison is as follows :- -Structure   &quot; ... ... ... 1,570Power plant ... ... 1,220Equipment ... .... ... 1,350Furnishing ... ... ... 1,600Crew   ... ... ... ... 110Payload ... 190Increases lbs.lbs.6,040Decreases Pressurisation, heating, &amp;c. ...Fuel tanksFuel    ...Oil410360,702001,040Net increase5,00096. It has been suggested to us that some part,at least of the increasein weight might have been avoided if A. V. Roe, Ltd., had applied better-
weight-control methods in the course of. construction. The constructors, fortheir part, have contended that the furnishings demanded by the corporation were unnecessarily heavy and that, moreover, they were forced to add tothe structure weight in order to provide additional strength to bear this andother equipment required Jby B.O.A.C.(u)97. We should not like to.say how much there is in these allegations.The subject of weight control in the construction of aircraft is an extremelytechnical one and we do not feel competent to express an opinion on the adequacy of the methods adopted by the constructors to keep the weightof the aircraft under control as work proceeded. It is also extremely difficulty-to apportion the various increases in weight to particular modifications, muchXless to estimate whether all the modifications or alterations were worth the weight involved. This was a question which should have presented itselfto all concerned whenever an alteration, or modification was put forward,and we have been informed that each- increase in weight was discussed between the Ministry of Supply, A. V. Roe and others concerned, in relationto strength and take-off performance. We are bound to say, however, thatthe record of successive weight increases does not suggest that the main-tenance of performance was always regarded by all concerned as of primary importance. .Fuel Consumption98. In addition to the effect of the increase in gross weight on cruisingspeed and height, and hence on the amount of fuel required, and apart fromthe aerodynamic imperfections, a factor, albeit a minor one, contributing to the deficiency in range, is the disappointing specific fuel consumption ofthe engines.99. During tests of the Tudor I the specific fuel consumption in flightwas calculated, not measured, and there is therefore a possibility of experi-mental errors. It appears, however, from the various reports, that consump:tion has proved to exceed by some 3 per cent, the original estimates madeby Rolls Royce, Ltd., in March 1944.100; Incidentally, in June 1944, Rolls Royce put forward more optimisticfigures for specific fuel consumption; this resulted in the increased payloadfigure being inserted in Issue 2 of the Specification, and may also have ledA. V. Roe to believe that they had something in hand as regards range.Before any production aircraft were completed for delivery, however, rolls royce had withdrawn this optimistic forecast and had quoted specific fuelconsumptions for the new mark of engine which were slightly higher than their original estimates made in March 1944. The figures given by B.O.A.C.in their report on the Nairobi trials showed that these later specific fuelconsumptions had been substantially met.101. The improvement of specific fuel consumption is one of the aims of normal engine development work, but particular attention was directed to it when the Nairobi report was received, as one of the methods by whichthe range called for by the specification might be recovered. Variousimprovements designed to reduce consumption have now been-made, and itis hoped that these, together with the modifications introduced to improve the drag characteristics of the airframe and power.plants, will enable a stillair range of at least 4,000 miles to be achieved.X11) Some part of the increase may be attributable to safety modificationsrequired by.,the Air Registration Board and to the new civil airworthiness strengthrequirements.; &apos;
I 102. Our general conclusion is that while, in the absence of the recentimprovements referred to above, specific fuel consumption was some 3 pet-cent, above the original forecast made in March 1944, this was not a major factor contributing to the deficiency in range. If, however, the moreoptimistic estimates made in June 1944 had been achieved, the improve-ment might have compensated in some degree for the drag.of the aircraft,and thus prevented its range from falling so far below the specificationrequirement.y   PART Y.-THE ATTITUDE OF B.O.A.C. TO THE PROJECT&quot;&quot;The &quot;Best&quot; versus the &quot;Good&quot;103. B.O.A.C. &apos;s attitude to the Tudor project must be viewed againstthe background of their primary functions, namely, those of commercialoperators. Accordingly, it would not have been surprising if, in 1943, whenthe&quot; Tudor scheme was proposed, the Corporation, looking to post-waroperating problems, had felt that the United States, where research, design and production had proceeded uninterruptedly throughout the war period, was more likely to be able to supply up-to-date and economic civil aircraft than this or any other country. It was, however, well understood and acceptedpolicy that the British Corporations should &apos;&apos; fly British &apos;&apos; and in thecircumstances the best policy would be to obtain a British aircraft so designed as to have the best possible chance of operating on the North Atlantic routewith a reasonable payload and of obtaining its share of the traffic in competition with United States aircraft. The Tudor gave promise of beingsuch an aircraft, provided that it could be produced quickly, and it was nodoubt on the basis of arguments of this kind that the Corporation gave its support to the project in 1943.104. &apos; The nature of the compromise which the Corporation would be forced to make throughout the period of construction of the aircraft is now clear, though, as we try to show below, it is by no means certain that thematter so presented itself to them at the time. Thus, if too much insistencewere placed on features designed to improve the aircraft&apos;s economic andother qualities delay would result; if the emphasis were wholly or mainly onspeed of production the operational.and commercial qualities of the aircraft might be seriously impaired. - ..105. It seems to us, however, that the Corporation failed to steer a middle course between these two considerations and the impression left onour minds it that the direction exercised by the Board and Management ofthe Corporation over the technical staff of the Project Branch was inadequate.In these circumstances it was not unnatural that this branch, which was,responsible for ensuring that the aircraft would meet operating requirements,should have sought for the nearest possible degree of perfection.;Purchase of United States Aircraft106. By the autumn of 1945 it was plain that the Tudor was late, and itwas impossible to estimate with any accuracy when it might be available;the Boeings and Liberators with which the North Atlantic service was beingoperated were fast approaching the end of their useful life and it was. clearthat some other type of aircraft would have to be used in order to avoidwithdrawal from the route, with all that that would mean to the prestige ofBritish civil aviation. The only British aircraft of the required range thenavailable&apos; was the Lancastrian (which carried ten sitting! passengers onTrans-Canada Airlines&apos; service across the North Atlantic) but it; was the view
of the Corporation that-the introduction of this: type during the period, whichit was hoped would be short, before the Tudor I became available; would bean expensive affair, i Accordingly,, application was made to the Ministry ofCivil Aviation on 25th October, 1945, for authority to purchase five Con-stellation aircraft. -.107. We are aware that suggestions have been made to the effect thatthe Corporation^ application to purchase American aircraft was due to a conviction that the British aircraft industry could not deliver the goods.Some of the allegations go further and suggest that a desire to obtainAmerican aircraft was responsible for the Corporation^ apparent lack offkenthusiasm for the Tudor. ..     . ....   . .108. We have been at pains to sift these allegations thoroughly. It isprobably true, as we have indicated in paragraph 103, that if the corporation had been completely free to choose the aircraft best suited to their require-ments as commercial operators they would have elected to buy Americantypes. But we are satisfied that, despite this quite natural predilection, theoriginal policy of relying entirely on the Tudor for the North Atlantic service was willingly accepted by the Corporation. In the Autumn of 1945, however,it became clear to the Corporation that there was no practicable alternative to the use of United States aircraft if there was to be a commercial service on the North Atlantic from the summer of 1946, and accordingly they feltthemselves bound to seek leave to purchase such aircraft.109. In the course of our enquiry into the matter we went very carefullyinto the question of the &quot;option&quot; on Constellation aircraft which it hasbeen suggested had been obtained by the Corporation some time before they made application to the Ministry of Civil Aviation for authority to purchasethem.110. The important facts emerging from this examination are, first, thatthe initiative in regard to the possible purchase of aircraft by B-O.A.C. wastaken by the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation when representatives of B.0TA.C.visited them in September 1945 in the course of a tour of American aircraftfirms and establishments; and, secondly, that no steps were taken to obtain,an option on the aircraft until it had been decided to seek authority fortheir purchase; and then only in order to hold the position while the matter was being considered by the Government.111. Our conclusion is that the Corporation and their representativesacted in this matter with complete propriety and that there is no justificationwhatever for any suggestion of irregularity in the transaction or of any,attempt to create a situation which would force the Government to acquiesce in the purchase of American types. : *112. While we do not think that the decision to purchase the Constella-tion aircraft could have been avoided, there is no doubt that it changed thewhole character and purpose of the Tudor I project. In effect the Constella-tion now took the place of the Tudor I as the stop-gap aircraft and whether there was any place for the Tudor, oh the North Atlantic route now depended upon the. existence, of a sufficient volume of. traffic,&apos; over arid above, the capacity of the Constellations; by no.means a safe assumption as eventshave turned out.113. So far as the Corporation were concerned, there was probably atfirst no conscious change in their attitude. Indeed, until the results oftheNairobi trials were known, there was a number of incidents and declarationswhich-support the thesis that the Corporation^ intention throughout 1946
2.3was to get the aircraft into service as quickly as possible. Thus, as late asNovember 1946 the Corporation were expressing themselves as anxious thatthe Nairobi trials should not hold up the introduction of the Tudor into service. Nevertheless, we cannot escape the conclusion that there was achange of emphasis in the actual day-to-day work on the Tudor, and thatthe Corporation were now even more concerned than before to aim atperfection to the virtual exclusion of other considerations.Air Training  114. The same apparent lack of drive and determination to do every-*thing possible to get the Tudor into service quickly is to be seen in thehistory of the aircraft which were available for training. By the end of1946, 5 Tudor I aircraft were available. Of these only two were used for development purposes; one was flown for only 83 hours in a period of20 weeks and the other, the aircraft which went to Nairobi, for 107 hours in a period of 8 weeks. !115. We have received no convincing reason for the non-use of the other three. It has been stated in evidence that they could not be used becausethey had been&apos; grounded on account of unsatisfactory fuel lines. The facts are that in November 1946 the Air registration- Board had issued a notice to ground engineers recommending, as opportunity offered, the replacementin all aircraft, and not merely in the Tudor, of one type of flexible fuel lineby another. We do not think that this recommendation need have precludedthe use of the aircraft for development and training, and we think that many more hours of flying could have been done with consequent speedingup of the solutions to the aerodynamic and other difficulties. This appliesnot only to B.O.A.C., but to all concerned. It is only by constant flying thatan aircraft can be &quot; worked up &quot;to maximum efficiency and it is our viewthat, throughout, insufficient emphasis was placed by all concerned on theneed to fly the aircraft as much as possible. One result of this has beenthat there has been virtually no air training of crews, and if the aircraft isto be put into service all this work remains to be done.116. We-cannot but conclude that the attitude of B.O.A.C. to the tudor I has become unfavourable on grounds other than those of a purelytechnical nature and this is borne out by the Corporation^ letter of11th April, 1947 (see Appendix D), which rejected the aircraft irrespective of whether its flying qualities could be rectified and whether its deficiency in performance could be fully recovered. In the. succeeding paragraphs weshall examine the reasons put forward for this decision.Reasons for Rejection of the Aircraft117. The&apos; reasons given by B.O.A.C. in their letter of 11th April(Appendix D) in support of their refusal to operate the Tudor I type on theNorth Atlantic are for the most part economic in character, though other factors are adduced, such as range, payload and competitive features whichin the Corporation&apos;s opinion combine to. strengthen the economic objectionsto the aircraft. -118. Impressive figures are quoted of the deficit to.be expected on theNorth Atlantic route if the Tudor I is to be used. For example, the loss on a service of a frequency of 7 flights a week is set at rather more than 900,000 a year. &quot; .     ...
119. /While we are not qualified to express an opinion on the economicsof the Tudor I, we have gained the impression that there are few reliabledata available on which to base a firm estimate of revenue and expenditure,and that some of the assumptions made by B.O.A.C. are open to question.For instance, the Corporation have allowed for the redemption of stock asweir as for the amortisation of the cost of the aircraft, which seems to usto be unjustified; no sleeper supplement has been included in the passenger traffic revenue; and the revenue-earning capacity of mail traffic appears tohave been underestimated. On the other hand, the assumed price of theaircraft does not take account of recent increases in cost nor, apparently, ofthe amortisation of development expenditure over the production aircraft.   i(120. We consider that the B.O.A.C. figures should be investigated bya. competent authority, with a view to arriving at a more reliable estimate ofthe economics of the Tudor I on the North Atlantic route. In connectionwith this, consideration should be given to the possibility of adopting some arrangement other than the payment-by B.O.A.C. of the full cost of theaircraft, e.g., hire arrangements such as have, we understand, been approvedby the Treasury for other types where a short life in service was anticipated.121. While the subsidy required is likely to be large in relation to thetotal amount available for the Corporations under the Civil Aviation Act, ithas always been clear from the inception of the project that uneconomicoperation would be inevitable and that the loss would be justified by the wealth of experience to be gained both by operators and, even more, byBritish constructors on this route. We place a good deal of emphasis onthis last point. It is essential for the success of British civil aviation,particularly in view of the new types now in development, that there shouldbe available to British constructors. as much experience as :possible of, therequirements. of this difficult route. The use of the Tudor I to gain this knowledge may be expensive; the cost of not having it might be muchgreater.122. Turning now to the related points of range and payload made bythe Corporation in their letter of 11th April, 1947, we observe that: they refer to an original estimate of 4,600 lb. of payload. The payload originallyaccepted by the Corporation and inserted in the first issue of the specificationwas 3,760 lb. for a still air range of 4,000 miles. It&apos;is true, that the secondissue specified 5,500 lb. of payload but this was based on optimistic forecasts of fuel consumption which were not realised : the figure of 4,6001b. appeared in a draft specification only.123. It seems to us unreasonable for the Corporation to argue now that failure to attain 4,600 lb. renders the aircraft unsuitable for service. Ifthis is a valid objection it is not clear what justification there was for theoriginal specification requirement of 3,760 lb., to which they agreed at the outset. We are bound to say that we do not consider that failure to reach the figure of 4,600 lb. or 5,500 lb. should be regarded as a factor justifyingthe rejection of the Tudor I.124. As regards range, the Corporation give it as their view that &quot; the range, if re-established by the modifications, at about 4,000 still air miles,would be marginal for the North Atlantic, thereby affecting regularity an,drevenue.&quot; The still air range of 4,000 miles was inserted in the specifica-tion at the suggestion of the Brabazon Committee, which had appointed asub-committee to study this question for all the types- of aircraft to be constructed for civil purposes. The sub-committee&apos;s calculations were basedon the longest stage on the North Atlantic route, viz., Prestwick-Gander,
220which is 2,114 statute miles. Some 1,880 miles were added to this distancein order to arrive at the required still air range; of this increase, about750 miles represented the effect of an average, Head wind of 53 m.p.h.,450 miles were allowed for diversion to&apos; an alternative airfield and theremaining 680 miles represented allowances for taxying, runnmg-up, climb,descent, circuits, stand-off, fuel,variation, navigational deviation and airframeperformance variation. After making all these allowances, the BrabazonCommittee concluded, that a still air range of 4,000 statute miles would be adequate to achieve 80 per cent, operating regularity,. It is true that they^qualified their recommendation by pointing out that meteorological dataover the North Atlantic was scanty and that in consequence some of the allowances might require adjustment in the light of experience, but we haveno evidence that experience has in fact shown the need for an increase inthis requirement. On the contrary, we are informed that the still air range of the DC 4M now being operated across the North Atlantic by Trans-CanadaAirlines is substantially less than 4,000 miles.(12) We conclude that, in theabsence of operating experience, there is no justification for the suggestion by the Corporation that a range of 4,000 still air miles would be marginal,nor that it would preclude a reasonable degree of regularity.125. Finally, we come to the competitive argument. The Corporationsay that the Tudor Is were intended as a stop-gap to cover the period1946-47, that that period will be over before they can come into serviceand that if the modifications are successful they will be competing withDC 4M&apos;s and other modern&apos; aircraft on the North Atlantic. It may beremarked that we have had no evidence which confirms the Corporation^ viewthat the period of use of the Tudor Is was to terminate at the end of 1947.On the contrary the aircraft were clearly intended from the outset to be useduntil one or other of the Brabazon types came into service and no witnesshas had the temerity to suggest that this could have occurred by the endof 1947, more especially since the war was still in progress when the recom-mendations of the Brabazon Committee were made. Indeed, it was con-templated in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Civil Aircraft Require-ments Committee (on which B.O.A.C. are&apos;represented) dated 23rd July,1946, that the commercial life of. the Tudor I on the: London-Montrealservice was likely to be prolonged into the years 1948 and 1949; and theChairman of B.O.A.C. himself, in a letter to the Minister of Civil Aviationdated 20th October, 1945, put the end of the stop-gap period at 1950.126. It is, of course, true&apos; that greatly improved American types havebeen introduced, and it is undeniable that, from the point of view of economicoperation, the Tudor I is less suited to this route than the Boeing strato--cruiser or the Lockheed Constellation. But,. as the Corporation already possess sufficient Constellations to provide a daily service and will possessBoeing Stratocruisers also, there appears to be no need to contemplateplacing the Tudors in competition with aircraft of these types on the London-New York service. Indeed, it has been for some time past the intention ofthe Corporation to place the Tudors. on the London-Montreal service wherethey would be in competition with DC 4M&apos;s operated by Trans-Canada Air-lines- aircraft which, even if more economic, are not pressurised. In comfort and regularity the Tudors should compare well with these aircraft.127. Our general conclusion is that it is in the national interest that the tudor I, assuming that the original specification performance isa&apos;ealised andthat a Certificate of Airworthiness is re-issued, should be used for,a service between London and Montreal.(12) It may be noted that this aircraft uses the same engines as the Tudor I.34623 D*
.- /;128v&apos;- If this recommendation is.-accepted there may.be .a balance ofTiidor I aircraft surplus to requirements. A number of suggestions have, beenput:tO&apos;US&apos;as&apos;to alternative usesfoE;the:type.on which we do..not.feel..ourselvescompetent to^ pass an opinion^.

Tudor, la-to be.SVA.A-. for use either in; their present; form or converted to. Tudon I Vs. -PART VI.-CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS129.   Following is a summary of our principal conclusions:-(1) The original concept  Was a relatively simple adaptation of the-Lancaster bomber. In the outcome there was little of the Lancasterleft.   (Paragraphs 36 and 37.)(2) The forecast that the whole of&apos;the original production order wouldbe completed in August 1945 was over-optimistic.  We do notthink that&apos;it would have been unreasonable to have allowed aperiod of 3J to 4 years for completion of the project.    (Para-^   - graphs 38-40.)        * .,j (3) From the. first flight of the prototype to the. grant of an AirworthinessCertificate, a period of 17 months elapsed.   (Paragraph 48.)(4) The aerodynamic faults, the rectification of which occupied this period,,do not point to any basic unsoundness in aircraft design, but it was an error, in-a. stop-gap type, to have risked the possibility of aerordynamic trouble by changing the double fin and rudder whichr-&apos;-   \ had been proved on the Lancaster.&apos; (Paragraph,,54.)(5): Moreover, it was an. error not to have called on the services of theRoyal Aircraft Establishment at : an earlier . stage and to have-   delayed (for nine months) trials -at the: all-up weight.    (Para-graphs 50 and 51.) - ,(6) Nevertheless, a:&apos;period, of 2  years from the start of design workto the- issue of. an Airworthiness Certificate cannot - be. regarded-as &quot;excessive.   (Paragraph 55.)(7) The  modifications  asked for by .B.O.A.C.  were not numerically-excessive-for. a virtually new. aircraft, nor generally -unreasonable.Finality could, however, have been reached on marry of them at-an&apos;;e&amp;ne&apos;f^stage inJthe development period.   (Paragraphs 58-66.) ,(8) These modifications were&apos; not of themselves a primary cause of delay,: but they hindered the design staff in the solution of aerodynamic-. troubles,&apos; while : the   Corporations   indecision   and   failure   toco-ordinate their demands led to friction with the management and loss of enthusiasm by the workpeople.   (Paragraphs 69-71.)(9) The fact that B.O.A.C. were hot themselves the buyers of the aircraft,and thus were not directly responsible for the cost in time and money of every modification they put. forward, played its partin causing delay.   (Paragraph 89.)- (10) In: default of mutual&apos; understanding and co-operation between con-structor and operator, the delays could have been reduced if all^concerned with the project had been impressed&apos; with a sense of.        Urgency by-sbme co-ordinating authority. , (Paragraph 87.) -(11) If B:0;A:C.and A. V. Roe, Ltd., had worked together with enthusiasm,whether of their own volition or under leadership, regular, servicesacross the North Atlantic might have-begun in the summer of1947.   (Paragraph 91.)
(12) Although B.O.A.C. as commercial operators would no doubt have preferred to operate &quot;proven United, States types, it was acceptedpolicy that the Corporation should &quot; fly British&quot; and the Tudorproject was accordingly accepted by them as the best possiblestop-gap.   (Paragraph 108.) - ..(13) B.O.A.C. failed, however, to steer a middle course between technicalperfection and speedy production. This was principally due toinadequate control over their technical staff. (Paragraphs 104and 105.) -(14) There was, on the part of B.O.A.C., a lack of drive and determination to get the Tudor quickly into service.   (Paragraphs 113 and 114.)(15) We have, however, found no evidence in support of the suggestion thata desire to obtain American aircraft was responsible for the; -Corporation^ lack of enthusiasm for the Tudor. The circum-stances surrounding the purchase of Constellations provide no suggestion whatever of irregularity in the transaction. (Para-graph 111.)(16) We do not think that the Corporation had sufficient reason forexpressing the opinion, after the Nairobi trials, that the Tudortype was not airworthy.   (Paragraph 82.)     .(17) We agree that the operation of the Tudor on the North Atlanticwould be conducted at a substantial loss. But this has alwaysbeen a feature of the project and would be justified by theexperience to be gained both by operators and constructors.(Paragraph 121.)       . &apos;(18) Provided the Tudor I fulfils its original specification performance, areasonable degree of operating regularity, combined with passengercomfort, could be attained by using this type on the north atlantic route.   (Paragraphs 124-126.)130.   We recommend :-(i.) That, provided the original specification performance is realised anda Certificate of Airworthiness is re-issued, a service between london and Montreal should, in the national interest, be begunas early as possible with Tudor Is; and that the resulting deficitbe. made good to the operators.(ii) That urgent consideration should be given to the possibility ofutilising those Tudor. Is not required for the North Atlantic for-express services&apos; on Empire routes arid for the services of BritishSouth American Airways Corporation.(iii) That in view of the relatively short life. to be expected of the tudor I,- -consideration should be given to the possibility of supplying the necessary numbers of aircraft for these respectivepurposes on an annual hire basis.

It was recommended that further invesfciga-tion into its causeshould be carriedout.The Royal aircraft establishment sug-gested that a furtherchange in the shape of the wing rootfillet would reducethe stalling speed and they also estab-lished that there wasa breakaway in theairflow behind the short inner enginenacelles, to deal withwhich the firm de-signed extensions.Ah aircraft fitted with these featureswas tested in Aw-.gust 1946 and some improvement- wasnoted. The -violenceof the buffet and the speed at which itoccurred were re-duced sufficiently byNovember 1946 for afull Certificate of airworthiness to beissued.B.O.A.C. reportedafter the Nairobitrials that in nor-mal cruising condi-tions serious tailbuffeting was ex-ineperienced whenentering turbulentair, and that theydid not regard theaircraft as . air-worthy. BetweenMarch and May 1947it was discovered bythe firm and . theRoyai Aircraft Es-establishment inde-pendently that thebuffeting was due toa small leak at theleading edge of themainplane near theswing root. The seal-jng of this reduced the amount ofbuffeting and alsothe speed at which itoccurred, so that it longer obtrudedinto operationalspeeds but merelyacted as a desirablewarning of approach-ing stall. The seal-ing also rendered thebuffeting speed rela-tivoly insensitive tofillet design, therebyenabling the firm to.put on the fillet withthe best dragcharacteristics.
Nature of Defects

Action by the firm between June 1945 and April 1946

Action by Boscombe Down and R.A.E. between April 1946 and November 1946

Action taken after the Nairobi trials (January 1947 onwards)

Swing on Take Off

The firm did not report adversely about this feature of the prototype. They did not regard the swing as more serious than on many other types of 4-engined aircraft with tailwheels.

Boscombe Down reported that there was a strong tendency for the aircraft to swing during take-off in a cross-wind, the effect of which was to prevent the use of full throttle on all engines early in the take-off, resulting in reduction in take-off performance.

The rudder modifications introduced to cure the kicking and improve the directional control enabled the tendency of the aircraft to swing to be more easily controlled. With these modifications, the aircraft was considered suitable for the issue of a Certificate of Air-worthiness.

B.O.A.C. reported after the Nairobi trials that the degree of swing on take-off would seriously handicap the operation of the aircraft on any route in service conditions, and that an increase in hazard and a reduction in operating regularity would result. The view held as a result of tests by the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Boscombe Down and B.S.A.A. is that the tendency to swing is not abnormal compared with that of other 4-engined aircraft with tailwheels, and is controllable. In view of this, and since the changes required to reduce the swing would be drastic (e.g., handed engines, change to nose-wheel undercarriage), such action is considered unwarranted by the Ministry of Supply.

Bounce on Landing

The firm were aware at an early stage of the tendency of the aircraft - to bounce on landing, but in, their view provided a suitable technique - was 

adopted the pilot would experience no difficulty in landing the aircraft. Their experience was, however, limited to flights at light weights.

In October 1946 Boscombe Down reported a tendency to build up a dangerous bounce and recommended the development of an improved undercarriage. A Certificate of Airworthiness was, however, issued before the shortened undercarriage was fitted, since it was considered that the tendency to bounce was controllable.

B.O.A.C. reported after the Nairobi trials that the tendency to bounce on landing was serious. An aircraft with shortened undercarriage beams (introduced on account of difficulties with the oil system and to be fitted in all production aircraft) was tested by Boscombe Down in March 1947, and this undercarriage eliminated the tendency to bounce.

Theaircraft (G-AGRI).which includes allthese improvementsis due at BosconibeDown for flighttrials shortly.roottheAPPENDIX D(See paragraph 31)- Letter of 11th april,, 1947, from B.O.A.C. to the Ministry of Civil Aviation. After a full review of the position the Corporation has concluded thatirrespective of whether the flying qualities of the Tudor I can be rectified, andwhether its deficiency in performance can be fully recovered, there is no longer any justification for including Tudor Is in this Corporations operatingprogramme.&apos; % The. original estimates for 1947-48 indicated that the employment of 16 ofthese aircraft on the North Atlantic route at a frequency of 14 per&apos; week wouldhave cost the Corporation  1,400,000 in the first year of operation.   At a frequency
of 7 per week this deficit would be approximately  740,000, but additional generaloverheads amounting to some  160,000 would have to bedspread over other routes; ,the gross resultant deficit, therefore, would &quot;be approximately  900,000. The directoperating costs of this aircraft, moreover, would exceed the revenue earned so thattheir employment would make no contribution to ground costs and overheads.These estimates assumed a payload of 5,843 lbs., which was a volumetric limitation;the range of the aircraft was not known at the time these estimates were prepared.3.   At a meeting at the Ministry of Supply on 14th March, 1947, it was learned that certain modifications were proposed.   If siiccessful, the best that could be hoped from these modifications was a still-air range of 4,000 miles and a corre-sponding payload of 4,000 lbs.   The still-air ranges required on the westboundflight are Shannon-Gander, 4,050 miles, and Prestwick-Gander, 4,280 miles.   EvenWfeith these modifications, therefore, the loss on the operation of these aircraftflduould clearly be greater than the estimate referred to above.4. There is, moreover, another factor which will increase this loss. Theestimates for 1947-48 assumed that Tudor Is would cost  78,000 each, and thatthey would be on service in May 1947. The Corporation was subsequently advised by the Ministry of Civil Aviation that the price would be  110,000, this figure not including thn cost of the latest modifications, which were not then contemplated.On the basis of one year&apos;s delay in bringing the aircraft on service and taking 110,000 as the initial cost per aircraft, the expenditure would be increased by 270,000 per annum. No estimate of the cost of the modifications now proposedis available. They are bound to be costly, and the figure cf  270,000 per annumwill, therefore, be still further increased.5. The date by which Tudor Is can be introduced into service, involving asit does systematic modifications and thorough trials, cannot prudently be estimated as less than one year from now. This allows six months for delivery and at least six months to bring the aircraft into service; training and proving flights wouldhave to be carried out under winter conditions. It will be recalled that these aircraft were originally intended as a stop-gap to cover the period 1946-47. Thatperiod will already be over before they can come into service. If the modificationsare successful they will be competing with D.C.4Ms and other modern aircraft onthe North Atlantic.        ,6. Our main handicap to-day is having to use obsolete and uncommercialaircraft. The loss to the Corporation arising from the use of these aircraft is a restriction to the development of our Empire routes. It is at the moment forcedon us by circumstances, but if we acquiesce in further attempts to rectify the tudor I the continuance of this restriction will then have become our own choice.7. We have to remember that we have to pare very severely to keep withinprobable Treasury limits for 1947-48. We cannot, therefore, as prudent and commercial operators contemplate the operation of an out-of-date Tudor I for thesuccessive. year 1948-49 onwards, when we can already estimate that it is goingto involve us in the loss of something like  1,000,000, a large proportion of thetotal vote, which might be expected to be allowed in respect of B.O.A.C.8.   Taking  all these factors into consideration the  Board has reluctantly,concluded that this Corporation must now decline to accept the Tudor I aircraftallocated to it, and that it is unable to &quot;accept any financial responsibility for the liquidation of the contract or for the modification programme proposed by theMinistry of Supply for the following reasons:  (a) The aircraft was originally a stop-gap solution offered on the grounds of the rapidity with which it could be put in the air. Assuming the modifica-tions were successful in re-establishing its performance, it was unlikely to be available for service for possibly 12 months, including a six months&apos;period after the date of its receipt by the Corporation. It could not,therefore, fulfil its original purpose;(6) The payload, already uneconomic, would be reduced from an original estimate of 4,600 lbs. to some 4,000 lbs. if the modifications were successful,&quot;and therefore the original estimates of heavy losses on the Canadianroute would be increased; and(e) The range, if re-established by the modifications, at about 4,000 still-air&apos; miles would be marginal for the North Atlantic, thereby affectingregularity and revenue. !Wt.  -12/47 f-o.p. 34623
