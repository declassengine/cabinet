THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of........&amp;*^&amp;&amp; -r   ,&apos; Vl - .    &apos; *TOP SECRET Copy No....... ......0*2*(k7) 30h11TH&apos; NOVEMBER .  19h7CABINETWAGES    policy memorandum by the Minister of Labour&apos;and National service am in full agreement with tho purpose of thedraft statement annexed to C.Pt(h7) 303 in its endeavour tosecure a relative stability of wages.    It is indeed because,of my conviction that some action to that end is necessary&apos;that I have welcomed the recent discussions&apos;: withthe-TradesUnion Congress and their promise to take, the subject&quot;.intoimmediate consideration.   Although I feel compelled aftermature reflection to express myself as&apos;severely critical,of the draft statement, I wish to make it-clear that whatfollows is in ho sense intended to minimise the importanceof the subject or the desirability....of finding a solution tothe &apos; problem. - - &quot;2. In my view,  the proposal now made by the Ministerfor Economic Affairs could not fail to have the followingresults:-(l) - It would&quot;disrupt existing machinery for thesettlement of terms and conditions of employment.. Claims for improved terms and conditions areformulated according to the views of the membership and&apos; it is the duty of the Executive Councils ofthe Trade Unions to endeavour to carry out theinstructions of their members.   The Executiveswould be placed in an impossible position if the rank and file were to gain the impression thattheir leaders were not in a position effectively to represent their views.   Unofficial action would inevitably follow and the extremists would be encouraged in disruptive action.   It has never been more important.than it is at the present tinethat the Executives of the Unions should retain their authority.(2) It would destroy the authority of theexisting Arbitration Courts, the Industrial court and the National Industrial Tribunal.. If the awards of those Courts were made subject to thedecision of a higher Court irrespective of theviews of the parties there would inevitably be a refusal to use those Courts.-1-
(3) The paper does not mention the problem ox?enforcement, but there is in fact no effective wayof enforcing a limitation of wage payments to individual workers0   This is indeed the rock onwhich all proposals for compulsory wage policy are bound to splits   Statutory regulationsprohibiting payments above specified amountscannot be effectively enforced;.    The awards ofthe Superior Court could not fail to becomecompletely discredited, in a very short space oftime if it were known that employers could ineffect ignore themc(k) No central Court can hope to deal with piecerates or incentive payments *   These are necessarilydealt with in the factorye   Accordingly, the findings of the central Court could only affectworkers and employers where no kind of piece-working or bonusing was practicable.(5) Although tho draft statement speaks of salaries, profits and rents, tho proposal dealsonly with wages.   This, in my view, makes it ;&quot;&quot;&quot;&apos;politically unacceptable(6) The proposal takes no account of the inflationary effect of putting up wages toincrease the attraction of particular industries.As one undermanning problem is solved, others are bound to arise and the wages to correct the newundermanning problem would need to be raised toa new high,level..   This, would load direct toinflation.    If action on this principle is to -be taken, is not the correct method to decreasethe wages in industries that are attracting &quot;labour away from the undermanned industries?Does anyone regard this as practicable?(7) The proposal exaggerates the practical effecton manning which is to be expected from wage*   differentials. In. many industries conditions ofemployment are more important than wages inattracting labour.   The most effective incentiveis security of employmente.(8) Bottlenecks are found in sections of industries and it will not be possible to limit wage increases in such sections so as to avoid interfering withthe rates of the other sections.(9) The proposal takes no account of the Controlof Engagement Order and the assistance to be derived from its operation in overcoming labour- shortages.    This seems a.serious omission inpresent circumstances and would be severely criticised..3* Per the above reasons I cannot support theproposal put forward by the Minister for Economic Affairs.-2-
1+. Apart from considerations of merit I think itwould-be most inopportune for the Government to come out atthe present time with proposals on wages.   The Trades UnionCongress are studying this problem and it would be far better if they could make suggestions to the Government.It must be remembered that it will be useless for theGovernment to make proposals that would not bo acceptable to the general membership of the Trade Unions.   Further,we must avoid the possibility of making proposals whichthe Trades Union Congress would feel bound to oppose.The Prime Minister is having a further meeting with theTrades Union Congress at their request on.Monday nextand I think we should await the result of this meetingbefore coming to any decisions.G.A.I.Ministry of Labour and -: National Service, S.W.1*11th November, 19U7.
