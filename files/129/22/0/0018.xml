(14-7) 79thConclusions, Minute 9) -the Cabinet invited me to arrange forthe present system of priorities to be reviewed.2. Steel is the most important allocated material andhas given rise to most difficulties in the balancing of        ^supply and demand.A Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Paymaster-General, was already considering the modifications necessaryin the steel allocation-machinery and I therefore asked the paymaster-General to review the priority system, as appliedto steel, with a view particularly to recommending such changes as -would admit of the inclusion in the priority field of products for export, or for import saving.3. The Paymaster-General has agreed a revised steelpriority system with the Departments mainly concerned and I attach a -copy of a memorandum (Annex I) which he has putforward setting out the new proposals.      I support theseproposals and propose,  subject to my colleagues&apos;  confirmation,to put them into operation immediately.4. Industry generally is closely concerned with and interested in the machinery for the distribution of steel and it is desirable that the changes in the priority procedure should be announced in Parliament.     I attach a draft, of thestatement (Annex II) which the Paymaster-General proposes tomake in the House of Commons.5. Discussions are proceeding in connection with the priority arrangements for other materials and I will submit a further report as soon as this work has been completed.&apos;r.s.c.Great.

ANNEX I .MODIFICATION OF THE STEEL PRIORITY system.     The present system of priority symbols for steel for items-on the Prime Minister&apos;s list was instituted in orderthat these items might get their full requirements of steelat the. proper time during a period when the total steelauthorisations were inflated beyond supply.2.  -  When the revised distribution scheme for steel is workingeffectively it should no longer be necessary to give prioritystatus to whole programmes;    it should then suffice to havea &quot;first-aid&quot; scheme by which assured delivery of steel couldbe secured in a limited number of cases in, order to avoidbottlenecks. &apos;3.&apos;    But in the meantime it will bo necessary to devisearrangements whereby an abrupt withdrawal of P.M.L. symbolsfrom the present priority programmes is avoided but some assistance is given to Departments primarily concerned withexport (or import-saving) programmes to deal with importantcases where a bottleneck in production^is/threatened.      Ingeneral, there are strong arguments against cancelling. P.M.L.symbols already given Tor these items.      This -would give an impression of a greater change of emphasis than is intendedat the present time and might indeed imperil the present -programmes if it were done before&quot;, the revised distributionscheme is working effectively.      For this reason it would notbe proposed to cancel any P.M.L. symbols attached to ordersalready placed.he      The proposal in this paper is that .a system of &quot;first aid1assistance, in a form which is -workable by production Departmeand the steel industry, should, be instituted immediately, atfirst alongside the present priority arrangements butsubsequently in replacement of the-overall priority enjoyed by
items on the present list.   This system should apply tosteel required for (i) export industries (&quot;both directconsumption and maintenance) (ii) shipbuilding (iii) import-saving industries such as agriculture.   The arrangements proposed would lead to a slightly increased quantity of priority steel in the first quarter of next year, but an   .appreciable reduction after the middle of the year.5*     An outline of the proposed method of operation isas follows :-Existing Priority Programmes,  (a)    All orders for steel already placed for delivery inany period of 19h.8 or even 1949 against the revisedproduction prograriimes of the existing priorityclasses - i.e. the classes specified in the PrimeMinister&apos;s Directive (CP. (47) 92 (Revise)), plusatomic energy development - will&quot;continue to enjoy the priority symbol already granted.(b) -Departments responsible for the existing priorityprogrammes may give priority symbols in respect oforders for delivery in Period I, 1948, up to thetotal of the steel which they sub-allocate to these programmes for that Period.(c) In respect of orders for these programmes for deliveryin Period II, 1248,  symbols may be given up to butnot beyond 66-f0 of the Period IV, 1947,.. allocationfor the priority programme in question.(d) Prom tho date of the introduction of the new arrangements, no new priority symbols should be issued for orders placed for delivery beyond 30th June, 1948,except insofar as the Departments authorised togive P.M.L. symbols on the lines described belowmay give such symbols to any existing priorityprogrammes as a charge against their quota ofP.M.L. symbols.
Revised Arrangements Proposed(e)    In addition to tho above, specified departments with, export responsibilities (the Board of Trade,the Ministry of Supply and the Admiralty) will be immediately allowed to give P.M.L. authority up toa ceiling of 5^ of their Period IV, 19h7? allocatio:of non-priority steel.(f) The Ministry of Agriculture and the Department ofAgriculture for Scotland will receive a- similarentitlement, but in recognition of the special difficulties which their contractors have experienced in securing deliveries, the percentageentitlement will for the time being be lOfo insteadof 0i(g) Prom 1st July, 19h8, the Ministry of Supply and theAdmiralty will calculate their five per cent by reference to their full allocation. -(h) These priority percentages will be applicableseparately to departmental allocations of(i) sheet steel (ii) general and building steel.The object of the scheme would be defeated ifdepartments y/ere able to concentrate on, say, sheetsteel priority orders representing 5$ or lOft oftheir allocations of total steel rather than ofsheet steel only.(1)   The Chairman of the Materials Committee will have,discretion to authorise the use of the prioritysymbol in exceptional cases not covered by theabove provisions.(j)    Ideally-,&apos; ,priority symbols should be granted in specific cases where it is necessary that aparticular order or orders for steel should be delivered in time to avoid a bottleneck in^manufacture.^   This must imply that there wouldbe- some examination of such cases either by the
regions or by hea&amp;qu&amp;rtersand that the priority&apos;    symbol would be tied to the delivery of aparticular ordoi1 or orders for stool,(k) It is-recognised, however, that the production department concerned might have to have recourse,in tho interests of administrative simplicity, toan arrangement &quot;whereby some part of theirallotment of priority symbols would be issuedwith the M. forms each quarter to undertakings which they knew were going to be in difficulties,.But it is of the first importance that such anarrangement should be regarded as an abnormalexpedient which departments-would seek to avoidas far as possible and tp^which they will only have recourse very sparingly.(!) So far as the application of the new form of&quot;First aid&quot; assistance to the export industries is concerned, the main difficulty is clearlygoing to be that of selection.     The generalqualification for an undertaking to receivev.o.......:-&apos;v-^.&apos;^-^-;^&apos;&apos;--assistance should be whether it was makingsomething&quot; which was going to be exported orsomething which assisted something else to be  -exported,  and similarly for import savers,.More specific criteria might be:-(i) Exports required to implement bilateral negotiations,(ii) Hard currency exports, which would rank.-   above all soft currency exports otherthan those covered by (i).(iii)  Undertakings with a high export proportion:which would rank above those with a lower
The greatest use of the scheme -would be to 4helpthe delivery of. small quantities of steel whichheld up large amounts of production,(m) It would be appropriate to grant priority symbolsto steel for common components which were holding up either exports or priority programmes.     But thispriority procedure should not be applied to deliveries of components themselves or of other &quot;common service&quot;finished goods.     Problems of this kind should betaken up ad hoc with the production department concerned.(n) This revised priority scheme,  including the percentageceilings indicated in ( e) , (f)  and (g)  above,  shallbe subject to review before the end of Period II, 1948.
ANNEX IIREVISED STEEL PRIORITY SYSTEMDraft of Announcement to be msde by the Paymaster-general in the House of CommonsEarly in 1947 a special priority was given to therequirements of programmes which directly contribute to theexpansion of fuel and power resources, including transportof fuel and. atomic energy.In order to give a marked impetus to these programmes, special priority symbols were attached to theauthorisations to acquire both steel and timber which were issued by Government Departments to firms engaged on- work for those programmes. ,These programmes absorb a large proportion of all&quot;&apos;&quot;steel available.It is now necessary to give a preferential supplyof materials,  and particularly steel, to programmes whichcontribute to direct exports or,  as in the ease ofagriculture,  to import savings.     The addition of these largeprogrammes to the.existing priority programmes would create a position in which the priority element- in steel would exceed the non-priority element, with the result that the priority label Would tend to become meaningless.The machinery for the allocation of steel is nowunder review and arrangements will be made to ensure that future allocations and deliveries of steel more closely match,the-real requirements and, further,  that excessiveauthorisations to acquire steel are not given.-In a condition in which deliveries are reasonably in accord with-real needs it is unnecessary to provide for bulkpriority authorisations.
. It is proposed,&apos; therefore, to substitute a systemof selective priorities, by means of which Departments&quot;responsible for the existing priority programmes or forexport or import saving programmes will be able to authorisethe use of a priority symbol for those limited quantities ofsteel the lack of which might seriously impede production.From now onwards the use,of special priority labelefor the requirements of the fuel,  power,  transport and atomic energy programmes will be steadily reduced.      Concurrently,the use of selective priority symbols will&apos;be introduced for export and import saving programmes and, by the middleof 19U8, all priorities for steel will be oh the restrictedselective basis. * f
