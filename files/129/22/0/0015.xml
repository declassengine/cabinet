/&apos;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 194781SECRETCopy No.32CP. (47) 30511th November, 1947CABINETPARLIAMENT  BILLpowers of the house of lords in Respect of subordinate legislationI was invited by the Cabinet on 30th October (CM. (47) 83rd Conclusions,Minute 3) to circulate for.their information a memorandum on the question of limiting the powers of the House of Lords in respect of subordinate legislation.Subject Matter to be dealt with . The subject matter which the Cabinet had in mind was no doubt the familiar &quot; affirmative &quot; and &quot; negative &quot; resolutions,,for. which provision is madeby a very large number of Acts, in connection with Orders in Council, regulations or other instruments by which subordinate legislation may be enacted, but,it isnecessary to define more closely the subject matter to be dealt with.3. The relevant powers of the House of Lords extend beyond the. field of subordinate legislation; we have to consider also the powers of the House inrespect of executive or administrative proposals of the Government; for example proposal for fixing the period of summer time under the Summer Time Act,1947 (c. 16) is administration rather than legislation, but cannot be made effective in the absence of an Address to His Majesty from the House of Lords as wellas from the House of Commons. Perhaps &apos; the statutory powers of the Houseof Lords &quot; (i.e., powers vested in the House by statute as distinguished from thepowers of the House under the unwritten constitution) would more fully describe the subject of review.4. I assume that it would not be intended to modify by the present Bill/the powers of the House of Lords as to Bills for local or personal Acts, or,as being analogous to such Bills, Bills for confirming Provisional Orders (includ-ing Orders made under the Private Legislation Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1936(c.52)). Such Bills are at present outside the operation of the Parliament Act,and the functions of the House of Lords as regards them are of a semi-judicialnature.5. On the other hand, it is for consideration whether the powers of theHouses of Lords in dealing with Orders under the Statutory Orders (special procedure) Act, 1945 (c. 18) should be modified. The purpose of that Act was toprovide a procedure similar in some respects to that for Provisional- Order Bills,but more expeditious, under which matters of particular concern to localities orundertakings which might also directly involve the public interest could receivedetailed consideration in Parliament so far as might be necessary, with the leastexpenditure of time in Parliament, the Act applies, for example, to the takingfor town and pouhtry. planning purposes of land held by statutory undertakers orof commons or open spaces. Under, the Apt the powers of the House of commons and of the House of Lords are co-ordinate, and the House of Lords could preventeffect being given under the Act to proposals of importance to the Government.Memorandum by the lord Chancellor34505
First, either House can annul an Order laid under the Act by negative resolution;and secondly, if a joint committee of both Houses reports against such an order the procedure culminates in a Bill which is to be treated for all purposes as apublic Bill, but the Act contains provisions for short-circuiting stages of the Billin one or other House which would take the Bill out of the operation of the parliament Act. If it were decided to modify the powers of the House ofXhrds,under the Act considerable rewriting of the Act would be required.6. The House of Lords has powers co-ordinate with those of the House ofCommons in relation also to &apos;&apos; Special Orders&apos;&apos; for gas and electricity purposes,as for example under s.10 of the Gas regulation. Act, 1920 (c-28) which provides(in subsection (4)) that a Special Order is not to be made unless both Houseshave approved a draft with or without modification. There would be little object in modifying the powers of the House of Lords as regards these Orders; they areanalogous to Provisional Orders, and the House of Lords has, in fact, exerciseda useful function in dealing with them, in relief of time which the House ofCommons would otherwise have had to expend upon them; moreover they havepartly become obsolete, and will probably all shortly have become obsolete, byreason of nationalisation.General Consideration on the Main Issue       ,7. . It is possible to state shortly the main considerations for and againstincluding in the present Bill a provision for limiting the powers of the Houseof Lords in connection with    affirmative &quot; and &quot;negative &quot; resolutions.On the one hand, apart from any general considerations of the suitabilityas a legislative organ, or as an organ for controlling administration, of a Chamberconstituted as the House of Lords is, much of the Governments legislation dependsfor its operation on the taking effect under Act of Parliament of subordinate legislation and administrative proposals, and the House of Lords have at present as much power to prevent their taking effect as the House had up to 1911to prevent Acts being passed. &apos;On the other hand, it is surely the fact that subordinate legislation requiresscrutiny, and the fact that pressure of time is very much less on the House ofLords; than on the. House of Commons gives the House of Lords greater oppor-tunity for such scrutiny than the House of Commons may be able to find. Andit has been argued that to restrict the powers of the House of Lords in this field by the present Bill might be to incur the opposition of the considerable weightof opinion which, whilst by.no means averse to the restriction of the powers ofthat House, is suspicious of inadequately controlled powers of delegated legislation. &apos;.Form of Restrictive, Provision asto *.&apos; Affirmative &quot; and&quot; Negative &quot;Resolutions- 8. The outlines of a restrictive provision as regards &quot; affirmative &quot; and&quot;negative &apos;:&apos; resolutions.can also be shortly stated. The general purpose would no doubt be to secure that the House of Lords should be able to impose on theHouse of Commons the necessity of second thoughts, and no more. This mightbe achieved-(a) where the House of Lords has at present power to prevent subordinate legislation or administrative proposals taking effect by passing a negative resolution, by providing that a negative. resolution of theV- House of Lords should be of no effect if, after the lapse of a givenminimum period from the date of the Lords&apos; resolution, the Houseof Commons resolve that the legislation or proposals in question be approved notwithstanding the Lords&apos; resolution; and(Jb) where the House of Lords has at present power to prevent subordinate legislation or. administrative proposals taking effect by refraining from passing an affirmative resolution, by providing that, where theHouse of Commons have approved and the House of Lords have not approved within a given number of days during which the matter has.. been before them, the legislation or proposal should take effect if,after the lapse of a given minimum period from the end of the periodallowed to the Lords, the House of Commons resolves that it is tohave effect notwithstanding the withholding of approval by the Lords.A negative resolution of the Lords as to subordinate legislation that hascome into operation should in addition be denied effect in any event during theperiod which must elapse before the Commons can affirm.
Certain Difficulties to be Met9. It would be unwise to propose a general restrictive provision on the lines indicated in the preceding paragraph without a careful review of the enactmentson which it would operate. There is, for example, s.12 (1) of the Supreme Courtof Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925 (c.49) as regards the tenure of office ofthe superior Judges, under which there is a power of removal by His Majestyon an address presented by both Houses of Parliament. It is evident that aproposal in general terms of which it would be an incidental effect to render aHigh Court judge removable on an address by the House of Commons would arouse controversy that it would be unwise to incur. I refer to this not so much on its own account as by way of illustration of the need for a careful survey before a restrictive provision is framed.10. The specification of the period for &quot;second thoughts&apos;&apos; by the Houseof Commons would cause some embarrassment. On the one hand the specificationof a very short time for all cases would arouse unnecessary opposition, but on theother hand it would be quite indispensable to specify a very short time for somecases; some enactments have provided for &quot;affirmative &quot; resolutions for the express purpose of enabling the Government to obtain immediate approval by Parliament of Government proposals which must take effect as a matter of urgency, of which an example was the proviso to s.3 (2) of the Financial Powers(U.S.A. Securities) Act, 1941 (c. 36), enacted for the purpose of enabling a loan tobe obtained from the U.S.A. as a matter of the greatest urgency. It is material in this connection that the form of enactments providing for &quot; affirmative &quot; or&apos;&apos; negative &apos;&apos; resolutions shows an extraordinary variety; some subordinateinstruments come into operation after having been laid for a given period, somewhen made, some when laid, some after being laid in draft for a given period,some when approved by resolution, some on being laid with a proviso for cesserof operation at the end of a given period if not by then approved, &amp;c.11. There is also a very great variation between different proposals whichare subject to &quot;affirmative &quot; or &quot; negative&quot; resolutions as regards their political importance and in particular as regards the likelihood of their giving rise tocontroversy between the two Houses. It may well be that the measure of opposition amongst those concerned for securing adequate control over delegatedpowers of legislation could be considerably reduced by making a selection amongstthe enactments as to which a restrictive provision would operate.12. There are a number of enactments (apart from those dealing with the gas and electricity Special Orders referred to above) which confer power on either house not merely to approve or to disapprove by resolution but to modify. Thereare not a great many such enactments, but such as there are would have to receivespecial treatment in a restrictive provision.13. Lastly, the framing of a restrictive provision would involve considerabletechnical difficulties of form. The enactments which provide for &quot; affirmative &quot;or &quot;negative &quot; resolutions are Worded in very many different ways and it wouldbe impossible to devise a general formula which would extend to all of them,and would produce a clear result as regards each of them, without lengthyresearch. This is not a very formidable consideration as a practical matter,because a formula could rapidly be found which would cover&quot; the bulk of theground, and indeed a great deal of the ground has already been covered (as regards&quot; negative &quot; resolutions) by the Statutory Instruments Act of 1946 (c.36); but itis inevitable that a rapidly produced formula would leave many ragged edges,and embarrassment would be caused during the passage of the Bill through theHouse by the production of specific instances of enactments which the formulaproposed would not fit.14. The considerations mentioned in the five preceding paragraphs point: to the conclusion that it would be preferable, if other considerations permit, thata restrictive provision should be framed after time has been taken for a detailedreview of the enactments on which it would operate, and possibly that variationsshould be introduced into it for its operation on different enactments, rather thanthat the passage of the present Bill should be delayed by the inclusion of a general provision in that Bill.House of Lords, S.W. 1,Uth November, 1947.
