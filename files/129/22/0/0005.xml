22S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (U7l 295- (POTH OCTOBER.   19U7COPY NO.CABINETPOTATO SUPPLIESMejaQrcndum by the Minister- of PoodTho latest estimates of potato supplies for this yearshow that unless we take immediate steps, to reduce the potatoconsumption by nearly one half (from 5ir lb. per head.per week to 3&apos;4 lb.- per head per week) we&apos;shall run. out of supplies manyweeks before the next crop is available. A full note setting out the supply position, the action which I have already takento conserve supplies, and my recommendations for an individualallocation scheme is attached.2. Our crop is down by about 20 per cent, outlast year&apos;scrop owing to a combination of reduced acreage (due to bad weather at the planting time) and low yield (due to the drysummer).     As a consequence of this reduced harvest, and thefact&apos; that consumption since June hrs been maintained at lastyear&apos;s level,  it is estimated that there will he only 2,252,000.tons of potatoes for civilian consumption in the next eight months. .   Last year for the same period we had 3,61(8,000 tonsand! even then there wore shortages at the end of the year. .3. There is little that can be done in Great Britain tosecure more potatoes for civilian consumption from farms:, butthere is a possibility, that vigorous action in Northern. Irelandmay produce another 30,000 to 50,000 tons from livestock feedingalone.L\,       -     There is no prospect of substantial imports,.     We may possibly be able to buy 150,000 tons from non-dollar countries.Crop, prospects in North America are poor, but I am.making carefulenquiries into the possibility of obtaining, supplies there,but I fear there is little hope of obtaining even a-modestquantity.5. Therefore foe only way in which we can close the gapof-1,396,000 tons is by reducing consumption.      It would bedesirable to do this by a full system of differential rationing,but the. problem of procurement, distribution and enforcementmrkes this impracticable.6. . I cm forced,  therefore,  to .recommend reluctantly to mycolleagues that we. should adopt a distribution scheme providingfor a flat rate allowance per head recorded by marking rationbooks.
7. I should back the- scheme by a publicity campaign,telling people why such a drastic reduction is necessary intheir own interests, encouraging retailers to honour and consumers to accept the scheme, discouraging waste and advisinghousewives and other cooks how to make the best use of available supplies.8* Although supplies are-sufficient for an average weeklyrate of consumption of 3w lbs. per head per week, as comparedwith present -consumption of 5  lb. per head per week, I shallhave to make allowance for consumption in schools,  canteens and catering establishments.     The net amount available for issueagainst the ration book will be only 2-g- lbs. per he-ad per week.I should welcome my colleagues&apos; views on whether-we should aim at a flat rate throughout the year or whether we should start with an allocation of 3 lbs. per week, and face the almost certain prospect of a reduction to 2 lbs. per week in the spring.9* It must be recognised that the scheme proposed willhot be&quot; a satisfactory one in many ways.     There will be no guarantee of supplies to the individual, no account of varyingnutritional needs, except to some slight extent through supplies to school end works canteens,  and enforcement will be practically impossible.     People in country districts will buy from growers,and urban housewives will sometimes find difficulty in obtaining-the authorised allowance.      Market pressure will probably leadto conditional sales and other forms of black marketing..10. -        More serious,  the very small allowance which&apos;must befixed may mean actual under-nourishraent for families who eatmore than the national average.     Total average consumption hasto come down from 5^ lb., to 3^-lb. per head per week.     working class families will get a maximum of 2-g- lb. or 3 lb. per headagainst their normal purchases of h-jr lb.     Middle class people,whose dietary habits are different, will- not be so badly hit.As a group, ^adolescents will suffer the most.11. The nutritional implications of potato rationing are-serious and I cm looking into the possibility of safeguarding the position of the more vulnerable groups,  especiallyadolescents.12.   -       This agricultural disaster makes it essential that weshould - even to the -point of over insurance - make sure of our supplies for 1924.8-49.      It seems imperative therefore that weshould plant a minimum acreage of 1,600,000.13. I ask my colleagues -(a) to authorise me- to introduce the distributionscheme.      (I should add that- the need to reduce . &apos;-------- consumption. Is-.so urgent that I have authorised- preliminary discussions with the trade and other ainterests concerned so that we can go ahead assoon as a decision is reached);(b) to decide whether the initial allowance should be2-g- lb. or 3 lb.;(c) to invite the Minister of Agriculture to proposemeasures that- will ensure a minimum acreage of1,600,-000 under potatoes, in 1948/4-9*J, S.Ministry of Pood, S.W.  1.,20th October, 194 7.
POT,-,TO SUPPLIES_1947-48Proposals for the ^regulation of distributiont 1. The latest estimates &quot;by the Agricultural Departments ofpotato supplies, which became available during the last fewdays,  require that-immediate action should he &quot;token to reduce,consumption during the winter and spring months.    They implyQ further deterioration in the declining nutritional standards of the United Kingdom which can only be prevented from becoming serious if imports of other foodstuffs and in particulaof cereals are maintained.-V&apos;. \ ,;&apos;A;.;upglj       2. The area planted in the United Kingdom in 1946 was at the record figure of    1,423,000 acres and the yield at 7.1 tons per acre was normal.    The same target was set for 1947, but owingto bad spring weather the acreage planted was 1,330,000 only&apos;/i.e. a fall of over 90,000 acres.    Furthermore, the yield thisyear is at present estimated to be 6.03 tons per acre,  the lowest since 1931.-After deducting allowances for seed,  (1,211,000 tons)chats&apos; (481,000 tons) normal shrinkage&apos;waste and consumption on farms    (790,000 tons)  priority exports, for instance to gibraltar and Admiralty stations (20,000 tons) potato powderfor use as on emergency reserve (30,000 tons)  and Servicesrequirements (93,000 tons)  approximately 4,400,000 tons were -available for the civilian market in Great Britain from thefirst liftings in June 1947, to the end of June 1948.    By 23rdNovember&apos;2,281,000 tons of this will have been consumed,. leaving2,172,000 tons plus 80,000 tons from Northern Ireland, forconsumption in the following 7i months.As a result only 2,252,000 tons of potatoes will beavailable fo.r civilian consumption in Great Britain from the23rd November to the end of the season.    This compares with3,648,000 tons (ive.  0 fall of 1,396,000 tons) estimated tobe required to meet the needs, of domestic consumers, catering establishments, fish friers and&quot;other users over the sameperiod;    this figure of need is based on the consumption of1946/47 when,  in spite of record acreage and normal yield, wehad barely, sufficient for our requirements.    This figure of2,232,000 tons represents an overall supply cf about 3:p lbs.per head per week (out of&apos;which supplies for catering establishments and&apos;.fish friers must be found) as compared with .5-t lbs.  available - during the some&apos;period last year.    There are- prospects of securing some imports, but they are too uncertainto be com.tod -on,jorts Imports from the Channel Islands may be estimated at30,000 tons,  subject however to the crop being reasonably free from Colorado beetle infestation.    European production has suffered seriously from the&apos;recent drought conditions;    this,combined with the increased use of potatoes for feeding tolivestock in nearly all countries, mokes imports from this source most unlikely.    Poland, Holland, Denmark and Rumaniamay agree to sell on favourable terms and negotiations are proceeding, but the quantity could not possible exceed 100,000tons.    South Africa anticipates a small surplus though the crop is not yet planted.    This source may provide 20,000 tons.All the foregoing sources,  therefore, cannot give us-more than150,000 tons.
Estimates of acreage in Canada and the MaritimeProvinces show a lOys decrease and a drop in &quot;total production ofapproximately 372,000 tons is anticipated.    This,  however, doesnot rule out the possibility of obtaining supplies from Canada,as production may still exceed demand.    Answers to enquiries on this point are awaited.    Last year 73,000 tons were imported from the disease free area,  and. it is unlikely that that figurewill be reached this season.    In tho United States, productionestimates for this season show a drop of 20$ compared with19L.6.    Indications are that there will be no large surplusseasonfIn Can ad:available for export and that lastaway prices will not be repeated.States the incidence of bacterial ring rots offer at give-and the Uniteda disease fromspecialCurrent?ndpros pectivejemulationf market-ong.which the United Kingdom crop is free&quot;- is acomplication for imports.    If substantial supplies, say, tothe extent of 250,000 tons, prove to be available from canada and the United States, which seems highly unlikely, it mightbe worth while to take the risk of ring rot.3. In. anticipation of the possible shortage later in theyear,  restrictions on marketing- have been in force from thecommencement of the I9J4.7 season, first in the form ofprohibitions of marketing of second early and main cropvarieties and subsequently on sales of better keeping main crop varieties.    These restrictions prohibited the sale ofapproximately half our remaining stocks, but were notpreventing the marketing of heavier than normal supplies, ofuncontrolled varieties^    Prom tho 20th October they hove been extended to additional varieties and rail movement into certainheavy consuming areas, notably London and Lancashire, has beenprohibited except under control of the Ministry of Pood andby means of Ministry purchase.    All rail movements from scotland, a deficiency area, into England and Wales are prohibited.    The intention of these measures is to restrict the run-down of stocks pending the introduction of a fullerscheme of control;    they are merely emergency and stop-gaparrangements which, unless quickly supported by other action,would lead to grave inequalities in distribution.The sale of any potatoes for stockfeeding is alreadyif diversion prohibited unless a licence is obtained by the grower,  and it;o stock-     is also an offence for a grower to use ware or seed potatoesfor feeding to stock.    Tjhere is. little diversion from farms of sound potatoes to stock &quot;feeding in Great Britain at present.In the past, there has been some illegal diversion atwholesale and retail levels, but it is hoped that thehigher prices now/in force following the withdrawal of thetonnage&apos; subsidy will check this.In Northern Ireland the position on farms is less satisfactory.    The crop is grown very largely by small farms .and it has always been the experience there that asignificent part of the total crop, nearly 1+0$ during thelast ten seasons,  compared with 11$ in Great Britain, remainson the farms where the bulk &quot;is fed to stock.    It is essentialthat this diversion should b.., greatly reduced and the resultant saving made available for shipment to GreatBritain.    There&quot;may be between 30,000 and 50,000 tons a tissue here.    At present the rate of shipment forecast forthe season from Northern Ireland is 90,000 tons compared withPreventi onfeeding
213,000 tons shipped last year.    We are discussing with northern Ireland whether, by reason of economies on tho farmtP and in the market, the present estimate of 90,000 tons cannot.  bo increased to about last year&apos;s level.Action has already been taken to reduce the legal sales for stockfeed by lowering the &quot;wore standard&quot; and allowingcertain previously prohibited types with superficial defects,such as cracks and dry scab, to move for human consumption:these would normally have &quot;been fed to stock.Reduction Reduction of the present 1^ inch riddle to 1 inch hasin size     also been considered as a possible means of reducing theof residue of small potatoes left on farms, but has beenriddle       discarded as being of little value.    The change would produce a few more potatoes - perhaps one quarter of a week&apos;s supply -at the cost of including more soil and other matter and couldnot be mode generally effective as few growers have riddlesof the smaller mesh.Following normal practice,  a reserve of about 700,000tons necessary for adjustment of supplies in deficiencyareas at the end of the season is being purchased.    Thefurther restrictions on sale and movement described above will reduce the supplies available to the wholesale trade andwill cause shortages to develop in some areas within a very short period.    It is therefore necessary to regulate sales tothe consumer at the earliest possible moment.    The limitedsupplies available must be spread to the &quot;best advantage overthe period until the 1948 crop becomes available in fairquantity (say 1st July,  1948) and distributed as equitably aspossible &quot;between consumers either by rationing or &quot;by some system of distribution short of rationing. .Difficulty 4. There ore two main types of rationing schemes: -of guaran- .. teeing (a)    Cancellation of coupons coupled, with registrationconsumer with retailers.entitlementunder a (b)    Cutting out of coupons with no tie to a retailer,ro ti oningscheme        (a)       Registration with retailers implies a guarantee ofsupplies to the retailer and of the ration to his registeredcustomers.    It would be impossible to tie a consumer to aparticular retailer if there were the possibility that hisretailer.would he unable to supply him whilst a neighbouringretailer had supplies available which he was forbidden to buy.It would,  however, he impracticable to secure that the potatoretailer would receive.supplies in accordance with the numberof customers registered with him.    There ore estimated to beabout 21+0,000 growers (including about 10,000 grower-salesmen)of whom about 173,000 will be holding stocks at the end ofNovember, 3,500 first hand buyers and not less than 150,000retailers.    To regiment supplies from grower to consumerunder these conditions as in the manner required by aregistration scheme would involve buying permits and returnsat each stage of distribution as well as the burden&apos;of setting up and maintaining records of registration.
This would be an immense , operation requiring a great-deal of time abd labour.&quot;1&quot;(b) Cutting out of coupons presupposes thetsuitable coupons are available.      They are not.     Printingof appropriate sets of coupons and their distribution to individual consumers would put an almost unbearable strainboth on the administrative machine and on the patienceof the public.     Moreover, while coupons surrendered bythe retailer would be a fairly accurate measure of thesupplies needed by him,  it would be no less difficultto relate his supplies to his needs than it would undera registration scheme.The foregoing- reasons seem conclusive againstthe imposition of a rationing scheme proper.Distribution   5. The only practicable course is some system of scheme controlled distribution.     The Ministry already operatesa number of schemes which fall short of full rationing,but.have nevertheless served to distribute, for example,milk,  oranges,  eggs and bananas with, a reasonablemeasure of&quot;fairness.      Such a scheme for potatoes wouldprovide that -(a) Except as provided in (e)  and (d) below, noretailer will be permitted to sell to anyconsumer and no domestic user will be permitted to buy more than X pounds of potatoes in any one -ration week.(b) All retail sales of potatoes to individualconsumers will be marked by the cancellation of a coupon on panel 3 on the back of the ration book of which there is one numberedfor each of 52 weeks.(c) Coupons will be marked (and potatoes taken)in the week to which they relate or in the-succeeding week.(d) Supplies to hotels, restaurants, canteens,etc. will be purchased by means of permitsand will be assessed on the principles appliedto rationed commodities.      Supplies to fish.,   . friers and manufacturers will be related totheir allocations of other foods in such away as to cut their supplies in a ratioroughly corresixmding to the cut in domesticsupplies.(e) The Ministry will take steps to regulate the flow of potatoes off farms to equate as nearly as possible over a period- the quantitiesentering the market and the quantities whichshould-be needed, to meet the consumerallowance.      A margin will be- allowed force on t ing en c i e s.4-   To start bread rationing,  5000 additional staff had tobe employed in Pood Offices.&apos;     Probably about 7,500would be required for this operation in Pood Offices and,,in addition,   the Potato Division of the Ministry and aisethe trade- would have to take on several thousand more.
(f)    To eliminate the buying of potatoes for otherthan legitimate resole,, each trader will begiven a document certifying that he is a legitimate trader without which he may not be -supplied.    This will throw some work uponthe Ministry and entail a certain amount of printing, but it is quite indispensable.It would be impracticable to apply this scheme to northern Ireland.This scheme has the merit of simplicity.    It involves a minimum of administrative intervention in tho distributivemachine - a most important point in a scheme designed to last for only seven months.    On the other hand, it has certainobvious weaknesses.   .It is designedly much more rough and readythan a full rationing scheme and this is a serious considerationwith so vital a commodity.    Adherence to the regulations willbe difficult to. enforce.    It will not be possible to providefor any differentiations between groups of consumers on the domestic allowance (except for children under five and seamen)or to take account of self-suppliers (probably no scheme could do this).    On the other hand,  it will be possible to make provision for the special needs of industrial workers and school children by giving to industrial canteens and schoolspreferential allowances of potatoes of the same order as theyenjoy for certain rationed foods.6. It will be seen,from paragraph 2 above, that it isestimated that 2,252,000 tons of potatoes will be availablefor consumption between 23rd November, I9h7 and 30th June, 191+8,or some 1,396,000 tons less than is needed.    The following arealternative plans for matching consumption with the available supplies:-(a)    Taking a conservative estimate of total supplies(at this stage in the season exact estimates are impossible as much of the crop is still inthe ground) it is possible to budget for a uniform domestic allowance over the whole period.On this basis the highest prudent level for thenormal domestic allowance would be 2-g- lbs.  per head per week.    There would be some nutritionaljustification for giving ,a lower allowance to children, under five years of age and this can easily be done since they have a differentcoloured ration book.    It is proposed that theyshould receive 1-g- lbs.  per head per week.    Thesetwo categories would use 1, .065,000 tons.Ordinary&quot;commercial catering establishments and institutions Would receive supplies on stric-t.....1parity with the domestic allowance, but schools and industrial canteens would be on a scaleroughly equal to their present consumption.These categories would account for 369,000 tons.Pish friers would be reduced to 136,000 tons.Manufacturers.would use 50,000 tons. . Total usagewould thus be 2,120,000 tons against 2,252,000estimated to be available for civilian  &apos;consumption in Great Britain from the UnitedKingdom supplies.
The disadvantages of this -plan are that it means a very drastic cut at the outset-before thescheme has got going rnd that it involves possiblyunnecessarily&quot;low.consumption during part of the worst winter period.      On the    other.hand, if theestimate proves to have been too pessimistic it-might be possible. ,to raise the allowance about theend of February at a time when from the point ofview both of general moral;:; &quot;and of nutrition sucha fillip would be- welcome.(a)    A domestic allowance of&apos;3 lbs.  per head (l  lbs.for children up to five) could be given, initially,with the certainty that it v/ould have to be reducedat the beginning of March probably to 2 lbs.off take figures would be similar in total to those given under (a),  but the off take would be differentlyspread over the period.      This method would give thescheme a much better start.      It would also give a slightly higher consumption during the depth of the.winter.      On the other hand, other things being-equal,  a decrease in the allowance is a thing to be avoided and this decrease would come at a time when there will be a widespread shortage of vegetables.&apos;1* The reductions under either plan will be a particularlyserious&quot;blow to families with growing children;    it may bedesirable to increase the bread ration for adolescents as soonas the reduction In potato consumption takes effect.&quot;&apos;&quot;8. It is obvious that the position is so serious that-con troi must be Imposed at the earliest possible moment.Tentative consultations have been begun with the growers&apos;  and traders&apos; organisations and also the National- Potatoes AdvisoryCommittee, which consists of growers, wholesalers, co-operative societies, retailers, fish friers and trade unions to discuss;with them the measures,proposed.     On the assumption that adecision is reached not later than 23rd October,  thisconsultation can be completed by. the . end -of the month.Any delay in reaching a decision will cause a postponementand add to our supply and control difficulties.After these consultations have taken pi roe, it isproposed to bring the Order into force in two stages.     Asfrom-2nd November,  retailers will be required to limit theirsales to. ration book holders and to -..the prescribed quantities,and to mark ration books.      As from the same date,   the use of potatoes in catering establishments,  canteens and fish friers&quot;shops will be limited to the statutory allowances.   &apos; The second -part of the Order will&apos;provide  that sales may not take place to.. re toilers and catering establishments who do not holdwritten authority to. buy from the Pood Office.      The earliest-date that this will be. possible will be the 30th November,since the necessary documents cannot be printed and Issuedsooner.      This procedure will mean that- there will be a periodof four weeks during which it will be possible for catering establishments to buy in excess of&apos; their requirements and for persons who  are not- bone, fide retailers to buy for resale.-In practice,  however,   this Is not likely to lead to a seriousdepletion of stocks,  since buying by. the general public,h-   Present home consumption of potatoes in urbam working-class .households is estimated at hi lbs. per head per week, of whichifci lbs.  are actual purchases.
whether through retailers&apos; shops or catering establish-    *merits, -will be limited, arcl  the drain on total supplies will be moderated.Seed 9. Arrangements to secure the prooer use of seed potatoes are being discussed with the Agricultureqj Departments.lltritional     10. The seriousness of the cut in potato consumptionImplications    upon our precarious nutritional standards must be clearlyrecognised.     While it- is true-that the overall loss in^ calories will only be of the order of 3 per cent., such a.loss - &quot;when added to other impending cuts in rationed foods - may well reduce the average nutrient intake belowthe marginal level of 2,800 calories per day.     Moreover,potatoes are one of the most important sources of vitaminC; - during the war they furnished fully one-third of the   -daily intake of this vitamin,     A substantial reductionin potato consumption during the winter months, when theirvitamin,0 content is normally low as a result of.storage and when alternative sources of this vitamin (e.g. fruit and green leafy vegetables)  are scarce, will seriouslyreduce the total vitamin 0 intake of the population.The allocations recommended in this memorandum /will/     - spread the available sup-plies as evenly as possible over&apos;      all age groups and classes of the. population, while-furnishing adequate supplementary allocations to children,of- school age (whose vitamin G requirements are high) and providing generous canteen allocations to industrial workers who need calories.     Nevertheless,  the general effect on the nutritional -&quot;well-being of&apos; the populationmust give cause for serious concern.11.     A   A further factor of almost equal importance isthe special place of potatoes in the daily menu.     Dietaryhabits are-notoriously difficult- to alter, and any Areduction in either household or canteen supplies isA bound to have a most unfavourable psychological effect on both&apos; the housewife and the worker.     If it should prove possible to de-ration bread fairly soon this would help&apos; ,to alleviate the position not- only from the nutritionalbut&apos; still more from the psychological angle.     Breadconstitutes an --invaluable &quot;filler&quot; when other staple foodsare in short supply, and though it occupies a very differentplace from potatoes in the daily menu, its free sale?/ould provide both a safety&quot; factor in marginal cases anda safety valve against popular frustration.     While the. de-rationing of- bread would help, to safeguard the calorieand protein intake of the population, it would notalleviate the shortage of vitamin-0. a It will thereforebe essential to take., all&quot; possible supplementary measuresto increase the vitomin*C intake during the late-winter-   and early spring months. &apos;Future   - 12. No one can gauge at this stage the harm that willProgramme -      be done to  the well being of the public by the comingpotato shortage, but it is apparent that-no steps that cannow be taken will prevent some decline in nutritionalstandards during- the difficult winter ahead.      If, however,;the future is in some measure to be safeguarded, urgentA steps will have  to be taken to prevent a recurrence of&quot; ^ &apos;      the shortages of the past and present seasons.     A veryfpl *   substantial increase in the acreage of potatoes was oneof the main contributions of British agriculture to the .nation&apos;&apos;s war-time food supply.      It seems imperative that,-     -    more adequate provision should&apos;- be made for potato productionA during the lQk8/U,9 season,  especially in view of the very    -&apos;A,- -9-  &apos; ;-Aa
problematic nature of the country&apos;a future food supplies from overseas.It can be assumed that demand will continue atslightly more than the 1946/47 level.      The introductionof bread rationing brought about a larger demand forpotatoes for human consumption and for domestic pigs and poultry.      It is&apos;probable that this larger demand will continue in 1948/4-9;    if bread rationing is dis-.continued -there remains still the likelihood of anincrease   of livestocks  and the usage of potatoes on farms end for domestic feeding may make - larger inroadsinto potato supplies.     Provision has to be made also for a slight increase in population. \   As already stated,the United Kingdom 1946 acreage was 1,423*000 and the yield was 7.1 tons per acre.     This was a record acreageand a normal yield.    . Never tireless-, supplies fell slightlyshort of needs.     The estimated yield this year is 6.03tons per acre which is the lowest since 1931 and. theavreage fell by about 90,000,      The need to insure againsta repetition of a combined high off take end low yield canbe met only by a large increased acreage in the UnitedKingdom,      The estimated demand would require an acreagoof 1,178,000 acres if the low yield of 6.0 tons per acreshould recur,  and even then much of the hew acreage wouldbe -planted on marginal land from- which the yield would bebelow average.   , It is re-cognised that there is neithersuitable lend nor sufficient seed to plant 1,780,000acres.      1,600,000 acres, for which seed could beavailable,  is the minimum insurance which can be regardedas wise in 1948/4-9.      The risk that with a good yield thisacreage would produce a surplus is one that must be taken if the danger of another failure is to be avoided.   .Ministry of Pood, S.,W.  1.,20th October, 1947.
