(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)SECRETRATION CUTS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE REDUCTION in supplies OF SUGAR TO MANUFACTURERSMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of food have,, on a previous occasion (CP. (1+7) 291),pointed out to my colleagues the very grave effects of the cuts in the domestic sugar ration.      I am now reporting onthe consequences of reducing sugar supplies to manufacturersby 25 per cent.  (CM. (1+7) 81st Conclusions, Minute 3).2. This reduction will call for total cuts amountingto about 250,000 tons per annum.      The most serious effects,from the point of view of the consumer, are outlined inthe following paragraphs:(3)      Chocolate and Sugar Confectionery.      production will &quot;be reduced by a quarter and it will therefore &quot;benecessary to cut the sweet ration forthwith from I+ ozs.  to3 ozs. per week.(&quot;b)      Jam and Preserves.      Production of jam will &quot;bereduced from 300,000 tons to 225,000 tons per annum.      Tomaintain the ration, at 1 lb.  per head per four weeklyration period (where it has stood throughout the war),270000 tons of jam and preserves are needed.      Thereduction in output would mean that the ration would haveto &quot;be reduced &quot;by at least one sixth,  end since the rationcannot be supplied in quantities less than 1  lb. pots itwould have to be achieved by withdrawing the consumer&apos;sentitlement in two of the twelve months.      There is onadded complication &quot;because jam producers hove been encouraged to &quot;buy plums to the limit with 0 promise thatsugar would &quot;be available and have,  in fact,  large stocks of fruit in hand which will be wasted.(c)      Biscuits and Cake and Flour Confectionery.      Thewithdrawal of sugar will mean a substitution of wheat tomaintain the volume of production - at serious cost toquality and palatability.3. The consequences of the cut in supplies will &quot;be repeated to a greater or less- degree throughout the foodtrades using sugar.      The Annex to this memorandum shows theprincipal users and the amounts by which they will be cutbut it&quot;excludes,  of course,  many smaller industries.      Somewill have to moke drastic cuts in production;    some will ,beable to maintain output at the expense of quality andpalatobility.      Beer will suffer some fall in productionand quality and there will &quot;be a reduction in soft drinks..COPY NO.CP. (1+7) 50029TH OCTOBER,   191+7.CABINET-1-
Syrup and. table jellies will be cut by 25 per cent.      these and other items are important elements in the points scheme,supplies to which will .be cut by at least a further 5 per cent.h* My colleagues are already aware of the effects onthe nutritional standards of the notion of the shortage ofthe staple &quot;fillers&quot; - breed, flour,-potatoes and oatmeal.In 19h1t when we had to face similar conditions, we werereprieved by Lease/Lend which provided both variety andnutrients.      Now we cannot provide the nutrients but we can,at least in part, provide variety.      To fail to do so may take us to the stage where the individual will eat less- thanthe limited supplies available to him through lack ofattractiveness.5* I particularly fear the consequences of the cuts inthe supplies of &quot;bread spreads&quot; - jam,  preserves.and syrup -since these are of great importance in ensuring adequateconsumption of bread and flour.6. The Minister for Economic Affairs did not announce the decision to reduce allocations of manufacturing sugarby 25 per cent, and I fear that the deferred announcement offurther cuts in rations will come as a great shock to thepublic.      I therefore do not wish to ma ice this announcementuntil my colleagues have had this opportunity to study the implications of this cut in allocations of manufacturing sugar,which is to he imposed in order to stock up sugar to the valueof  6.900,000.J.
