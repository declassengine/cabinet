(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY\S GOVERNMENT)62SECRET COPY NO. j^^j&quot;CP. (J4-7) 30129TH OCTOBER,  19U7*CABINETREGISTRATION OF STREET TRADERSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council at their meeting on 25th September (C.M.(h7) 77thConclusions, Minute 5) the Cabinet considered a recommendationof the Man-Power Committee that a Bill should be introducedproviding that any person who engaged in street tradingshould have a certificate that he had registered for employment at an employment exchange   and that he was notrequired for essential work.     The Cabinet&apos;s view was that,it would he undesirable to introduce separate legislation to control street trading on these lines and the Minister ofLabour was asked to consider what steps he might take,        ^&apos;without fresh legislation, to require persons engaged instreet trading to register compulsorily.2. In accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s request theMinister of Labour has submitted to the legislation committee a draft Order under Defence Regulation 58A theeffect of which would be:-(i)    to require any person who engages in streettrading in an urban area to register, whereuponhe would be given a certificate of registration&quot;by the Ministry of Labour as proof that he had.complied with the Order;    and(ii)    to put all street traders under an obligationto produce their certificates of registrationeither on demand by a police officer in uniformor at a time and place specified by the officer and to give their names and addresses to theofficer if so required.A copy of the proposed Order is annexed.3* The Legislation Committee recognise- that inputting forward this Order the Minister of Labour is seeking to implement the assurances given by the Prime Minister inthe House of Commons on 6th August that the Government wouldtake all action open to them against spivs and drones, andthey were informed that- the Trade Union Side of the national joint Advisory Council and the Ministry of Labour&apos;s Women&apos;s-Consultative Committee approved.the Minister&apos;^ proposals.They consider,  hoy/ever,  that if the proposed Order is madethe Government will be exposed to strong criticism and they feel bound to bring to the attention of the Cabinet- theobjections which may be raised.
U, The Order will no doubt be attacked on the groundthat it singles out street traders for specially severetreatment.in that they are put under an obligation toproduce their certificates of registration on request to thepolice, whereas the wholly unoccupied person (e.g.  thedaughter of well-to-do&apos; parents) will be dealt with underanother Order which will merely impose a general duty to register &apos;without any ohligation to produce a registrationcertificate on request.      It will be pointed out that largenumbers of street traders are respectable citizens performinga useful function and the Government will he called on tojustify subjecting these people to police enquiries whichwill not be addressed to other less worthy members of thecommunity.      In particular it will he represented that theimposition of the obligation on established street traderswith fixed stalls in such streets as Strutton Ground is utterlyunreasonable.      This lost objection might,  it is true, be partially avoided by exempting from registration streettraders who are already licensed by the local authority, butthis exemption would have effect only in those districts where licensing by the local authority is provided for bylocal Acts, i.e. London (including some suburbs outside theL.C.C.  area), Edinburgh, Glasgow&apos;and Greenock;    and thegeneral criticism/would remain.5. On the other hand, the proposed Order-may well be criticised on the ground that it will be ineffective.      Thusthere would be nothing to prevent 0 street trader, when asked by a police officer to produce his registrationcertificate, from saying that he had left the certificate athome and giving the officer a fictitious name and address;and the Home Secretary has pointed out that to make the Orderreally effective it would be necessary to confer on police officers the power to arrest on non-production of aregistration certificate.      If any such power were to betaken it would,  of course,  intensify the objections set outin paragraph h above.6. Finally,  it is very doubtful whether even when theOrder is enforced it will result in any appreciable additionto the man-power in productive industry, since the type of person who engages in undesirable street trading is unlikely to stay in any useful occupation.      As against this,however,  the Minister of Labour has pointed out that,  unlesssomething is done to deal with the undesirable type of street trader,  the trade unions will remain dissatisfied.In particular the Trades Union Congress have urged very .strongly that the new controls over the ordinary industrial workers when changing their jobs will not be accepted by them or readily complied with if people who are performing no .useful service are not also subjected to control.7, The Cabinet ore accordingly asked to decide in thelight of the points set out in paragraphs 3 to 6 abovewhether the -Minister of Labour should proceed to make anOrder, under Defence Regulation 58A on the lines of the annexeddraft,  subject to such minor modifications (e.g.  the exemption of street traders already licensed by the local authority) as might make the Order more acceptable.H.M.Office of the. Lord President of theCounci1,  S.W.1.29th October,  191+7.
