(1+7) 28th Meeting,Minute 1+) to seek the approval&apos; of the Cabinet to theacceptance by us of an additional provision in the LocalGovernment Bill which would remove the restriction onCouncillors who are members of Co-operative Societies from .taking part in proceedings of their Councils in which question;;affecting Co-operative Societies are&quot; being discussed.2. The present restriction is in Section 76 of theLocal Government Act, 1933 and Section 73 of the LocalGovernment (Scotland) Act,  191+7, which provide that if amember of a local authority has any pecuniary interest,direct or indirect,  in any contract or proposed contract orother matter,   and is present at a meeting of the localauthority at which the.contract or other matter is the subjectof consideration, he shall disclose the fact and shall.not take part in the consideration or discussion of,  or vote on,any question with respect to the contract or other matter.An important provision from the point of view of Co-operativemembers is that the interest of the member&apos;s spouse is theinterest of the member.      We are empowered to remove thedisability, /but only in the very limited circumstances wherethe number of members.Of the local authority disabled at anyone time vi/ould,be so-great a proportion, of the whole- as toimpede the transaction of business, or where it appears to us that it is in the interests of the inhabitants of the areathat the disability should be removed.3* Co-operative Societies are registered under theIndustrial, and Provident Societies Act,  1&apos;893,  under which the share that a member can hold is limited to  200,  and theinterest on the shares to 5 per cent.      There is no restriction on membership,  and membership of Co-operative societies is in&apos; fact high;    there are at present 9 millionmembers.      A shareholder of a Society can,  therefore, have only a very remote financial.interest in any contract affectinghis Society.      He;is in a position substantially different from a shareholder in an ordinary profit-making Company, where
147the rate&apos; of interest is not restricted under-Statute, -and where the holding of a  200 share might give a shareholdera major interest in the Company.4. We should be prepared to accept a new clause inthe Bill (together with the necessary provision applyingit to Scotland) on the lines indicated in the Annex.A.B.A.W.2nd December, -191+7*Ii
