THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted tor the Cabinet.   December 1947CONFIDENTIALCP. (47) 3218th December, 1947CABINETCROWN PROCEEDINGS ACT, 1947Memorandum by the Prime minister the Crown Proceedings Act will shortly come into force and under its provisions, for the first time, an order for discovery of documents may be made against Government Departments. This means that in any action to which^a department is a party it will have to disclose to the other side, under an orderof the Court, all documents in its possession relevant to the matters in issue inthe action, subject to the very important exception that if the appropriate minister is of opinion that the production of a particular document would be injurious to the public interest, he may withhold production of that document.This right to withhold production of a document is of the greatest importance and I therefore think it right that I should impress upon my colleagues that itshould be exercised only after most careful consideration.2. The documents to be withheld from production in the public interestfall into two classes (i) documents which, by reason of their contents, should not be produced,and(ii) documents which, irrespective of their contents, must, as a class, be withheld from production.Examples of documents falling within the first class are documents containinginformation the disclosure of which would be injurious to national defence, the safety of the State or to good diplomatic relations.The second class comprises all those communications with or within a publicDepartment the production of which would prejudicially affect the candour andcompleteness of such communications and so prejudice the public interest.Examples of these documents are departmental minutes and reports from officials to their Ministers or to their Departments. There are also some communicationsmade by members of the public to Departments upon the footing that their contentswill not be disclosed. It is important to appreciate, in dealing with documents34611Copy No.3
falling within the second class that disclosure or non-disclosure in no way depends upon the contents of the document. The contents of the document may be quiteinnocuous, yet nevertheless, if the document falls within the class, it shouldnot be disclosed. - The sole test is: (a) Would the public interest be injuriously affected if the contents of aparticular document were disclosed?(&amp;) Does the document belong to a class of documents which, in the publicinterest, must be withheld in order to preserve the frank expression ofopinion by. Government officials and others to Ministers and withinGovernment Departments ?3. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that the decision whether or not a document is to be withheld from production is the responsibility of the minister himself. It has been suggested that matters of this kind may properly be left to officials of the Department. This is not so, and the Minister must personallyconsider the document and form his own judgment, with such advice as he thinks fit to take, whether or not the public interest would be injuriously affected by itsdisclosure.It may be that the Minister is not always available. He may be out of thecountry or for other reasons away from his Department. In these exceptional cases the Permanent Head of the Department may give the decision.4. There is one further matter to which I must draw attention. There are some documents which are of such a nature that the public interest might be gravely injured if the mere fact that they existed were disclosed. Por example,documents relating to military secrets or highly confidential communications oragreements with a foreign State. The Act provides that Eules of Court to bemade under the Act shall secure that the existence of a document will not be disclosed if, in the opinion of a Minister of the Crown, it would be injurious to thepublic interest to disclose the existence thereof. This additional right should beexercised only in exceptional cases where the Minister is himself satisfied thatinjury to the public interest would result if the existence of any particular docu-ment were disclosed.5. The considerations to be taken into account in deciding where the publicinterest lies are not considerations of law and for that reason the duty of dealingwith these matters is laid, not upon the Judge, but upon the appropriate Ministerof the Crown, who alone has the necessary information at his disposal for thepurpose. Nevertheless, in any case in which the Minister feels doubt, he should refer the matter to the Law Officers for their advice, as they will be conversantwith the general principles underlying the statutory provisions and the legaldecisions which have from time to time been given relating to the peculiar positionof the Crown in regard to disclosure of documents.C. E. A.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,8th December, 1947.
