REC recommendations(1)    His Majesty&apos;s Government should take note of theUnited Nations recommendation in favour of the partition of Palestine.   They should do nothing to ohstruct the implementation of this recommendation by the United Nations,but British troops and the British administration should inno circumstances become involved in enforcing the decisionor in maintaining law and order while the United nations commission implement it.(2)    The plan of withdrawal of British forces and administration at Annex B should ho adopted, involving thetermination of British civil administration by 15th Mayand the completion of withdrawal by 1st August, 1948.(3)   Since the sharing of authority between thePalestine Government&apos; and the United Nations Commission wouldbe intolerable, and since the arrival of the commission would probably provoke Arab disturbances, thus upsetting our withdrawal plan and endangering our whole position in theMiddle East, we should do all in our power to arrange itsarrival in Palestine at the time when we are ready to handover to it, i.e. 1st May.   Sir Alexander Cadogan should negotiate with the Commission for this purpose.(4) Sir Alexander Cadogan will also have to negotiate with the Commission on various other matters connected withthe handover of authority, including financial matters.(5)    So long as we are administratively responsible,we should make every practical effort to maintain controlover immigration,  even though it may not be possibleeffectively to limit it after 1st February.(6)    If the maintenance of the present quota should prove impracticable the first step should be to move the illegal immigrants now &apos;in Cyprus, who should in any event be trans-        f-ferred to Palestine before pur evacuation is complete.(7)    The necessary sanction should be given for legislation by Act of Parliament and Orders in Council.
2.     Una, tod Nations decision the General Assembly of the United Nations has approved by the requisite two-thirds majority a recommendation to His Majesty&apos;s Government and the other United nations that Palestine should he divided into two independent States,one Jewish and the other Arab, with a Joint Economic board to link the financial and economic systems of the two States.The text of the most important part of the recommendationsis given at Annex A.    Other parts deal with boundaries andthe city of Jerusalem.    The boundaries between the two Statesrepresent on the whole acceptance of Jewish claims.   Eacho-bate consists of -,three separate areas joined with each other by narrow corridors.   The Jewish. State has a very largeArab minority.    The Arab State has a very small Jewish minority.Jerusalem is to be a separate territory under the United&apos;Nations Trusteeship Council.3* One of the most important parts of therecommendations is the establishment of a United nations commission consisting of five representatives (Czechoslovakia,Panama, Bolivia, Bencaark, Philippines).    The Commission will assume authority in Palestine- as we give it up and will beresponsible for setting up provisional councils of Governmentin each state and establishing the boundaries.    If theyare unable to set up the xjFovis:i-onal councils by 1st Aprilthey are to refer back to the Security Council.h.      Jewish and Arab reactionsThe Jews have warmly welcomed the recommendation .and will clearly give their full co-operation to the united nations Commission, in setting up the Jewish State.   The arab states have refusad to recognise the United Nationsrecommendation and are expected not to co-operate in any way with the United Nations Commission.   They have for some time been threatening to take military action in Palestine andto&apos;incite disturbances-there.   They profess not to intend to start any trouble while the British administration isstill in Palestine.    The Mufti will however no doubt do &quot;his best to stir up trouble both in Palestine and outside.5. This being the Arab-attitude, it is difficult tosee hov; an Arab State can be set up as recommended by theUnited Nations.    The Arabs - both Arab Governments andPalestinian Arabs - are themselves divided and there will bevarious claims to the Arab areas of Palestine.    There is verylittle prospect of the Arabs being willing to co-operate in working the Joint Economic Board.   This might have animportant effect on the economy of the whole country.
6.     Attitude of His MajestyTs Government at United. nations the United Kingdom representatives at the united nations, while assisting the respective Committees withfactual information, have consistently taken the line thatwe would not comment on the substance of the partition-proposal or any other proposal v/hich was before the Assembly.Our position as regards the enforcement of this or any other-settlement was, however, made abundantly clear as follows :-(a) We would not be responsible for enforcing asettlement which was not agreed by both Jews and Arabs.(b) If invited to participate&apos; with other united nations in enforcing a settlement which was not agreed byJews and Arabs, wo would decide according to our idea ofthe justice of the settlement and the difficulty of enforcingit.    (Repeated efforts have been made during the discussions at the United Nations to involve us in the implementation ofUnited Nations recommendations.   All such attempts have beenresisted as this would have involved us in assuming the majorrole, and the settlement in fact recommended is manifestly--moat unpopular with one of the parties.)(c) We would in any case, failing Jewish-Arabagreement, withdraw from Palestine by 1st August, 19h-8.(d).   In the course of our withdrawal, our troops and- administration -could not be used to enforce a United Nationssettlement which was not agreed by both Jews and Arabs or tosupport a United Nations Commission in enforcing it.7. This neutral policy is amply justified on two main grounds :-(a) -We have tried on numerous occasions in the pastto put forward solutions for the settlement of Palestine.Each one has been rejected by one side or-the other, or both.We have been suspected of ulterior aims in Palestine. ; If wehad now associated ourselves, with any positive proposal,we should have diverted on to ourselves the opposition andresistance of one or both of the parties.(b) We undertook in the mandate to establish inPalestine a national home for the Jewish people on the clear understanding that nothing should be.done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish -communities in Palestine.    It has proved impossible to reconcile these two objectives and we are therefore justifiedin laying down the mandate, which has proved unworkable.   we did not undertake in the mandate to establish a Jewish orArab State by force or to coerce either party in theinterests of the other.    If we were to undertake it,  or tobe associated in any.way with the enforcement of a settlement as unpopular Y/ith. one of the parties as that now recommendedby the United Nations, the whole responsibility vrould fall- on us, as the only armed forces on the spot are ours.   It would thus clearly be against our interests to become involved inmajor repressive actions in Palestine, Vi/hich would most seriously affect our whole political,  strategical and economicsituation throughout the Middle East and the Moslem world.       -&apos;
8..     YJithdrawal of British, forcesIn this situation the Chiefs of staff were asked to suggest a plan for withdrawing &quot;British, forcesin as short a time as possible and on the basis of with-drawal being complete by 1st August.   They have recommended the plan shown in Annex B,. which is now put &quot;forward for the endorsement of&apos; tho Cabinet.   The plan provides for theevacuation of essential stores and of the greatest possiblequantity of other stores, but some 150,000 tons of less essential stores will have to bo left behind.   Efforts will naturally be made to arrange with the successor authorities that we shall be able to remove or dispose of the storesleft in Palestine after our withdrawal.    This plan has been endorsed by the Defence Committee.9.     Thei interim periodMilitary and administrative necessities make It most desirable that we should maintain administrative responsibility for Palestine until about 15th May;    otherwisewe should be undertaking a precipitate movement1 involving a still greater loss of stores than will in any ease be inevitable.    It would bo-an intolerable situation if ourPalestine Government were asked to share its authority witha United Nations Commission.   Y/e must therefore make everyeffort to prevent the latter trying to set up its authorityuntil wo are ready to hand over, i.e. about 1st May(allowing a fortnight for tho hand-over process).   Moreover,it should be our object,  during the period while we areadministratively responsible, to maintain the status quoso far as possible (though some increase   in immigrationmay be inevitable) and to do everything within our powerto prevent the outbreak of disturbances.   We have receivedassurances from Arab spokesmen that they do not- intend tomake trouble while we are still in charge and we have sentArab Governments a message expressing the hope that these assurances will be fully honoured.    It seems likely,&apos; however,,that the arrival of the United Nations Commission would provoke serious disturbances among the Arabs, even if wewere still in control of the administration.   This is. there-fore another very strong reason for arranging the assumption&apos; of authority by the Commission.and its arrival in Palestine .at a time in conformity with the British withdrawal plan.10.   &apos; Negotiations with the United Nations CommissionIn view of the preceding paragraph,  the primary object of these negotiations must be to arrange for the arrival of the United Nations Commission in Palestine at atime most suitable to our requirements.   Sir alexander cadogan should accordingly be instructed to negotiate with. the United Nations and to make every effort to ensure thatthe plans of the Commission fit in with ours,  i.e. that theyonly arrive in Palestine just before we are ready to handover to them.    (This will involve inter alia a modificationof the recommendation that the commission should, report back to the Security Council if it has not been able to setup provisional councils of government by 1st April).   Allpossible diplomatic action with the countries represented on the Commission,  the U.S.A. and the Dominions will betaken in support.
.11* Sir Alexander Cadogan v/ill also have to undertakenegotiations with the Commission on a number of matters connected with the handing over of authority, includingparticularly a suggestion that a Jewish area should heevacuated at an early stage, -and the disposal of assets.On the latter point, it is clear that Palestine&apos;s liquid assesswill not be sufficient to meet all current liabilities - inparticular, provision of pensions for Government servants.Our attitude should bo that the United Nations Commission andthe successor Governmonts should automatically honour any obligation assumed by the Palestine Government at any time before its termination and that our agreement to surrenderthe assets should bo conditional on this.12.     Illegal ImmigrationThe Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, have statedthat they would be unable to. maintain preventive measures in.Palestine against illegal immigration after 1st February,1948.   The Defence Committee recognised that the Army couldnot be expected to play a part in controlling illegal immigration after that date, but agreed that, s-d long asHis Majesty&apos;s Government remained responsible -for the mandate,it would be right to continue such preventive measures as were possible outside Palestine, including,  if practicable,the interception and diversion of ships Toy the Royal Navy.The Committee also agreecl that no announcement should bemade to suggest that there had been any change of policy.At an earlier meeting- (D*0.(47) 23rd Meeting) Ministers had agreed that it was essential that the illegal immigrants nowdetained in.Cyprus should be removed from British territorybefore completion of the withdrawal.    If the maintenance ofthe present quota up to 1st May should prove impracticablethe first step should be to remove the illegal immigrantsnow in Cyprus.   Recommendations for carrying out this policy will shortly be submitted in the light inter alia of theUnited Nations recommendation that a port should be evacuatedbefore 1st February, 1948, to provide facilities for asubstantial immigration^13.     United Kingdom legislation on the relinquishment of the mandate, the presentPalestine Government should be terminated and all jurisdiction of His Majesty in Palestine should cease.   Legislation whichconfers powero or imposes duties on His Majesty&apos;s government or on the Government of Palestine must be revoked and someadaptation will be required in Acts of Parliament and orders in Council in relation to Palestine,   legislation in theUnited Kingdom, both by Order in Council and by Act efParliament, will be necessary to achieve the above purposes.If the date proposed for the termination of the mandate isadhered to, it may be possible to pass the necessary Actbefore that date.    If this cannot be done, xt will be-.,necessary to deal with such points as are possible by Orderin Council before the termination of the mandate andsubsequently complete the legislation by the passing ofan Act.   We seek authority to instruct the parliamentary counsel to prepare the legislation required in either event.E .B .A*C . J.3rd December, 1947.  .

ANNEXJBPlan for Withdrawal from-Palestine recommendedToy the Chiefs of staff*               We feel that the first principle of thisevacuation is. to treat it&apos; as a normal military withdrawal&quot;based upon, a series of clear -cut backward moves.      Once an area has been evacuated it will not be reoccupied.      In thisway,any likely Arab follow up in-Arab areas has least chance&apos; &apos;.of clashes with our troops.      Bearing in mind long termfuture relations,  this,is very important. .   Naturally it isnot possible for fighting troops to prepare for and conductclear cut backward moves so long as they are employedassisting the civil government to maintain law and order and guarding stores.      Therefore throughout the plan fightingtroops are relieved of these two tasks and then given a short time to poise themselves before withdrawal. .......2. Evacuation of the armed forces will be carried outin accordance with a geographically.phased programme whichi.s broadly:Phase I.-&apos;.    Gaza civil district including R.A.F.A. H.will be evacuated by 29th February.Phase II.      Jerusalem, Lydda and part of Samariaby 31st May. .Phase III. Remainder of Samaria and Galilee by30th June.Phase IV. An enclave around Haifa&apos; which does not entirely conform with the civil district, by 31st. July.3. In Phase I the civil authorities intend- preceding the military by a &quot;short time, but if the situation is sufficiently quiet -they will remain behind.     . In Phase II.the Central Government may have to leave Jerusalem before the&apos;fighting troops,  say mid-May, and in this event would be incapable of fulfilling the functions of Civil Government.If the security situation allows,  it might be possible forthe Civil Government to remain in Jerusalem for a few weekslonger.      Thereafter certain ,civil &quot;administrative -staffs as required will remain in areas still occupied by troops andwill give all assistance constitutionally possible to themilitary authority who will control, occupied areas only to theextent that is required for the efficient conduct of withdrawalk. The military authorities will restrict demands uponrail movement and port facilities to. ovoid disrupting thetrade and economy of the country,  particularly the citrus tradethroughout the periodof evacuation. . -,.5. .     .        Within the limitations of paragraph five the greatestquantity possible of stores of all three services will be evacuated through Haifa and by land to Egypt.     No stores ofmilitary value will be disposed of in Palestine but will be destroyed if&apos; they cannot be evacuated before the fighting troot
withdraw.    &apos;:,Evacuation of stores will start on 1st December.Even so and assuming most favourable conditions this will mean.the complete loss of nearly one hundred and fifty,thousand tons of useful service stores as a rough estimate.6. Evacuation of troops will be conditioned firstlyby the rate at which Palestine can reduce its fighting strength and secondly by the rate and manner in which itwill he possible to dispose of units released.      Troops suchas 6th Airborne Division which are leaving M.E.L.P.  willmove first.      Troops which are going into existingaccommodation in M.E.L.F. will^move second.      Troops suchas 1st Infantry Division which are moving mainly to Libyawhere accommodation will not be ready until June will movethird.      Evacuation of troops in these three phases willstart rather slowly in February and increase gradually untilfinal evacuation.7. The Royal Navy and R.A.P. will conform with thegeneral plan in four to seven above. p.8. H.Q.. Palestine will remain the controlling Landporce Headquarters until the end and after leaving Jerusalemis likely to move straight to Haifa.      H.Q. R.A.F.  willconform. &apos;
