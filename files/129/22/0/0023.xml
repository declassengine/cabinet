THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1947SECRET Copy No.CP. (47) 31324:th November, 1947CABINETEXTINCTION OE HUMAN RIGHTS IN EASTERN europe memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsTOTALITARIAN regimes now rule over the whole of Eastern Europe exceptEinland, Greece and Turkey. They rule over or threaten important parts of central Europe. What should be our attitude to the rapid extinction of human rights and the fundamental freedoms in this area? A decision is required for application in the Statements of Ministers in Parliament and elsewhere, in ourofficial publicity and in the attitude of British representatives in the countries concerned. The question arises in a special form in respect of the three Balkanex-enemy countries. For the Peace Treaties, now in force, impose on their governments an obligation to ensure that the human rights and fundamentalfreedoms are respected, invest His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Russian and united States Governments and their local representatives with a special positionin connexion with the carrying-out of the Treaties, and provide machinery foruse when violations occur.2.   I recommend : (a) That we should continue, in regard to Eastern Europe as elsewhere, tomaintain our stand against totalitarianism in all its manifestationsand particularly against the suppression of human rights and thefundamental freedoms.(b) That in Bulgaria, Roumania and Hungary we should put on record our views in regard to breaches of the human freedoms clauses of thePeace Treaties, as may be necessary to make our attitude clear, butthat for reasons which I shall expose below we should not, in respectof the human freedoms clauses, for the moment bring into play themachinery laid down for dealing with breaches of the Treaty.3. The recent developments in Eastern Europe need little elaboration. the trend is everywhere the same though the precise stage reached varies in thedifferent countries. In Yugoslavia we have a pure and full-fledged Communistregime on the Soviet model, though the original considerable degree of popularityinherited from its war-record is decreasing as a result of the growing suppression of popular liberty, friction with the peasants and measures against the roman catholic Church, and the regime in consequence becomes more brutal. in bulgaria the only legal Opposition party and the Opposition press have now beensuppressed and one of the Government parties (the Zveno) is now under attack;the Social Democrats, after purging, are incorporated in the Fatherland Front-the Communist-controlled Government bloc; the political and economic liberty ofthe individual is well-nigh - extinguished by a brutal police-regime; many who do not undergo like Petkov the travesty of a trial are exiled to remote villagesor sent to forced labour camps. In Roumania, all legal opposition has now beeneliminated, the Government has recently been purged of all but Communists andtheir puppets by the dismissal of the Foreign Minister and his fellow-Liberalsand the fusion of the Government Social Democrats; King Michael has recentlybeen kept in complete isolation in order that the feelings of the mass of the peopleagainst the regime may not, as in the past, vent themselves in demonstrations of14440   34566
loyalty and affection for him; and the police, and strong-arm men, among whommany of Horia Sima&apos;s Iron Guard, the former Nazi spearhead in Roumania,have been enrolled, become ever more efficient and powerful. In PolandMikolajczyk&apos;s Party, which is believed to represent about 80 per cent, of thepeople, has been broken up; the Right-wing Socialists await trial; the Govern-ment Socialists have endorsed the Cominform Declaration; the Roman catholic church is the last, but still formidable, organised opponent of Communist rule,In Hungary matters have not gone so far, but the Communists, by their controlof the Ministry of the Interior and its machinery and police, can terrorise all important opponents into submission, or flight, and the Social Democrats&apos; attempts at resistance are, I fear, rather unlikely to succeed. Even in Czechoslovakia, the communists have recently become much more aggressive, the Russian veto overparticipation in the Marshall discussions has discouraged the anti-Communists.Dr. Benes is no longer the man he was, and the omens are, I fear, not good.4. It is sometimes suggested that for the sake of good day-to-day relationswith these totalitarian regimes we should overlook their internal practices, acting on the theory that they are no concern of ours and that by expressing ourrepugnance for them we do not stem the tide of totalitarianism, but rather make matters worse. There are, I believe, very strong reasons against such a course and it is certainly not true that by refraining from criticising the Soviet orYugoslav internal regimes we have achieved good relations or made internal conditions less severe. I agree that we should not actively intervene where wehave no proper locus standi or obligation to do so. But we cannot, in our public statements and publicity take, a line on human rights in regard to Eastern Europecontradictory to the line we take at the United Nations and apply to the rest ofthe world. Our belief in the human rights and in the liberties of Westerndemocracy is part of our way of life, which must be the basis of all our publicity.This belief represents in foreign countries more than anything else what west and for in the world. Our tacit denial of this cardinal article of faith inregard to Eastern Europe would immediately be remarked in the rest of europe and in the Middle East, with disastrous effects. .We have been scrupulously careful not to encourage subversive movements in Eastern European countries or anti-Russianism, or to lead the anti-Communists to hope for support which we cannotgive. But we should continue, as I recommend in paragraph 2 (a), to maintain our stand against totalitarianism in regard to Eastern Europe as elsewhere. this need not involve official protests through the diplomatic channel, but would be part and parcel of our attitude on this subject as shown in our publicity generally.5. In regard to Poland, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia this policy willmerely entail publicising so far as we can our way of life, through culturalcontacts, exchanges of visits, and our information services and on, also, the B.B.C.overseas broadcasts; and in the case of Czechoslovakia, we may in addition beable to strengthen the faith of the legitimate non-Communist Parties and in poland that of the Government Social Democrats. We should, of course, alsocontinue to make mutually beneficial trading arrangements where possible.6. Bulgaria, Roumania and Hungary, on the other hand, have acceptedPeace Treaties which not only impose limits on their armed forces and commercialnon-discrimination, but also the obligation to secure to all under their jurisdic-tion &quot;the enjoyment of human rights and of the fundamental freedoms includingfreedom of expression, of press and publication, of religious worship, of political opinion and of public meeting.&quot; These treaties also invest the Governments ofthe U.S.S.R., the United States and the United Kingdom with special obligations of enforcement; and in case of disputes about implementation elaborate machinery-is laid down, passing through diplomatic negotiation and a committee of the heads of Mission of the Three Great Powers in each capital, to arbitration bya nominee of the Secretary-General of U.N.O. (See text of Articles 35 and 36-of the Peace Treaty with Bulgaria attached. Similar clauses are included inthe Treaties with Rounmnia and Hungary.) In Bulgaria and Roumania, andit will soon be the case I fear in Hungary too, regimes exist which by theirvery nature violate these treaty obligations.   What course should we follow ?7. In Bulgaria it is doubtful whether there will be clearer violations of the human Rights Article than those which already exist : (a) the continued sup-pression since the end of April of the Opposition Press, (b) the dissolution inAugust of the Opposition Agrarian Party, and perhaps (c) the gradual dis-integration of the remaining opposition elements by the present method of sum-mary exile to villages within the country.   Almost the same position exists in
Roumania. In Hungary the human rights provisions of the Peace Treaty havenot yet been flagrantly violated.8. The arguments for going ahead with the full Treaty procedure may besummarised as follows : (a) We have accepted, in the Treaty itself, a moral obligation towards the populations of these three countries to do what we can to enforce the Treaties, and we would be putting ourselves in the wrong if we did not invoke the machinery provided for enforcement.(b) The procedure laid down in the lreaty might prove the most effective way of arousing world opinion.(c) Even though any arbitrator appointed by M. Trygve Lie might tend to pursue a middle course, recourse to the arbitral procedure stands agood chance of resulting in a useful ruling.(d) We should show Roumanian and Hungarian Governments that we meanbusiness and this may have the effect of slowing up the process ofcommunisation.(e) We may at some stage wish to arraign one of the three countries beforethe United Nations or the International Court and it would be difficultto do this unless we had previously made use of the machineryexpressly provided by the Treaty for its enforcement.9. On the other hand it must be remembered that, even supposing that theneutral arbitrator had the courage to condemn the accused Government outright,there is no means of enforcing upon them a greater respect for the human rightsobligations of the Treaty. To use the Treaty machinery to try to enforce these obligations will serve to this extent merely to demonstrate its ineffectiveness.Again, the immediate use of the enforcement machinery by His Majesty^s Govern-ment (and the United States Government would probably take simultaneousaction) might so anger the Bulgarian and Roumanian Governments and theirRussian masters that they would retaliate by a further and more drastic purgeof Opposition elements. Moreover, they might speed up the process of closing inupon our Legations, thereby diminishing their utility as sources of information and their effectiveness in obtaining results on, for instance, the economic clauses ofthe Treaties.10. My conclusion therefore is that, while we should certainly use the fullTreaty machinery at the right time, it would be premature to do so at this moment.We should certainly await the outcome of the Foreign Ministers Conference andI would not proceed against Roumania while King Michael&apos;s position is inquestion. Our best course at this stage is to keep the matter alive on our side andat the same time keep our hands free. We have sent in a note to the bulgarian government recording that the situation regarding the Opposition Press and theOpposition Agrarian Party, to which we have already drawn attention, stillexists, and that it violates the Treaty which has now entered into force. Wethink it would be unwise to go further at present by calling on the bulgarian government to take specific action to remedy the situation, for. upon their failing to do so, we should have to be prepared to invoke the Treaty machinery straight&quot;away.11. We can when we wish extend to Roumania, and. if necessary, to Hun-gary, the procedure which we have now initiated in the case of Bulgaria.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,2&amp;th November, 1947.ANNEXArticle 351. For a period not to exceed eighteen months from the coming into force ofthe present Treaty, the Heads of the Diplomatic Missions in Sofia of the soviet union, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, acting in concert,will represent the Allied and Associated Powers, in dealing with the bulgarian government in all matters concerning the execution and interpretation of thepresent Treaty.
2. The Three Heads of Mission will give the Bulgarian Government suchguidance, technical advice and clarification as may be necessary to ensure the rapid and efficient execution of the present Treaty, both in letter and in spirit.3. The Bulgarian Government shall afford the said Three Heads of Missionall necessary information and any assistance which they may require in the fulfilment of the tasks devolving on them under the present Treaty.Article 361. Except where another procedure is specifically provided under any article of the present Treaty, any dispute concerning the interpretation or execution ofthe Treaty, which is not settled by direct diplomatic negotiations, shall be referredto the Three Heads of Mission acting under Article 35, except that in this casethe Heads of Mission will not be restricted by the time-limit provided in that article. Any such dispute not resolved by them within a period of two monthsshall, unless the parties to the dispute mutually agree upon another means of settlement, be referred at the request of either party to the dispute to a Corn-mission composed of one representative of each party and a third member selected by mutual agreement of the two parties from nationals of a third country. Shouldthe two parties fail to agree within a period of one month upon the appointmentof the third member, the Secretary-General of the United Nations may be requested by either party to make the appointment.2. The decision of the majority of the Members of the Commission shall be-the decision of the Commission, and shall be accepted by the parties as definitive-and binding.
