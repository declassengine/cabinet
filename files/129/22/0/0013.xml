I think it is generally agreed that a statement on wages policy should be made by the Government in theimmediate future and the Chancellor of the Exchequer is,I understand, in broad agreement with the suggestion madein the memorandum.The matter .is made very urgent for two reasons --(e)    a meeting has been fixed with the Trades UnionCongress on Monday,  17th November,  to&apos;discuss- . wages and connected matters;    and(b)    it is desirable,  in my view,  that if a government statement is issued,  it should be made beforeah; announcement is made on miners&apos; wages.For these reasons I feel that it is essential to bring thematter to the Cabinet at short notice.3. I suggest that our proposals should be put to theTrades Union Congress and the British Employers&apos; Confederationnot for -approval but as a statement which the government propose to make and which -they hope these bodies will not oppose.R. S.C.Office of the Minister for Economic Affairs,S.W. 1.11th November,  1947.
annex draft Statement on Wages policy. The Government&apos;s economic policy depends largelyfor,its success upon our ability to make and sell the exportsnecessary to buy the imports we need to feed our people and keepour industry going.     This calls not only for constantapplication to our job but also for energetic steps- to avoid -the danger of inflation which arises from bur present position.Unless this danger con be kept in check we shall fail in our export tasks;    prices will rise out of control and the wholestability of our economy will be endangered.     We shall allsuffer as a result and it Is therefore the duty of everyone toplay his or her- part in averting the danger.2. Even now there is some inflationary pressure atwork,  and this will grow much worse,  in the absence of measuresto correct it, when the volume of goods,available has beenstill further reduced by our cuts in imports and the removalof many more goods from the home market for export.      If this further reduction of goods at home were to be accompanied by   ^any general increase in the level of individual incomes,without really substantial increases in production, inflationwould inevitably follow.      In these circumstances the-Government must take the exceptional step of setting out certain general considerations os a guide to all those whosedeliberations and actions contribute to the settlement of theamount of individual incomes, whether they arise from profits,investments,  salaries, wages or any other -source.Over the last century particular economic considerations have developed traditional or customaryrelationships between individual incomes in differentoccupations, which hove no relevance whatever to present-dayconditions and necessities. -In conditions of full employment,  such as we nowenjoy,  the relative attractiveness of different occupationsis a potent factor in determining the distribution of ouravailable manpower,  and it is quite impossible for thatdistribution to be regulated in accordance with our urgentneeds if the&apos;less important occupations are allowed to become more attractive by reason of the individual incomes that oreattached to them.It is thus essential that relative income levelsshould encourage the movement of labour to those-industries where it is most needed, and should not, as in some cases they now do, tempt it in a contrary direction.We must therefore abandon the old traditional&quot;hierarchy&quot; of income levels in favour of a new relationship which is more consonant with the national interest.3. , The following are the general considerations towhich the Government draws attention:--1-
(a) It is neither possible nor desirable for theGovernment to interfere directly with the income of individuals, otherwise than by taxation.     To go further  -would mean that the Government would be forced itself to assess and regulate all individual incomes according tosome scale which would have to be determined.      Thiswould be an incursion by the Government into what hashitherto been wholly regarded as a field of free contract between individuals and organisations.(b) In present conditions,  and until more goods and services are available for the home market, there is noreason or justification for any general increase of individual money incomes.      Such an increase cannot make more goods available and so can have only an inflationaryeffect.      Unless related to a substantial increase in production,  it would drive up prices,  adversely affectpensioners, children and other recipients of social servicebenefits,  increase the money cost of our exports and soreduce their saleability and by black market pressure makeit almost impossible to operate the controls necessary inview of the continuing scarcity of supplies and manpower.(c) It does not follow that it would be right to stabilise incomes as they stand .to-day.      Conditions demand that at present there should^be two exceptions to thegeneral considerations under (b) above.First: . Where individual incomes are still belowthe recognised minimum scale which has emerged from the .many recent decisions of the Trade Boards and Wages Councils.These, decisions have brought up the. scale of many hithertolow-paid wage-earners to a figure which is consideredadequate by Trade Boards and Wages Councils in the existingcircumstances and there can be no good argument for retainingany scales lower than those set by such decisions.Second:    Where in the national interest it isnecessary in order to man up essential under-mannedindustries or services that:the wages or salaries should beincreased in order to make the occupations more attractive.This applies not to all undermanned industries but onlyto those which require manning up in the national interest.It is generally recognised which such industries are, butin any case where there is a doubt the Government wouldupon request be prepared to state its opinion.      It shouldbe pointed out that-many of the less nationally important industries and occupations must remain under-manned solong as the present shortage of manpower continues and itis indeed the Government&apos;s policy that, this &quot;should be so, &apos;in order that the labour may be available for other morenationally important industries.It would be directly contrary.to this policy if theless important under-manned industries were to hoveincreases above their present levels.It is of the utmost importance to recognise that any increases negotiated or decided by arbitration in thenationally important under-manned industries should not bemade the reason for demands by other industries which donot fall within that category..     If increases were to be
granted for this reason in other industries thewhole object of improving the attractiveness ofthe under-manned industries would be defeated andthe result would merely be a general inflationaryrise in all incomes, which would benefit no-one and would defeat the objective of manning up theessential industries.(d) If there should be a marked rise in the costof living which renders the existing level of individual incomes inadequate to provide a decentstandard of living then -the case of the&apos; lower andfixed incomes will need reconsideration.(e) It will be observed from the above, principlesthat there is no justification at the present time forany rise in incomes from profits, rent, or other like, -    sources and that rises in wages or salaries should onlybe asked.for and agreed upon in one of the twoexceptional cases mentioned above.U. In order to avoid all necessity for undesirableinterference with the existing methods of free negotiation and contract the Government must press upon all those engagedin negotiations or decisions which might result in an increasein individual incomes to keep these principles firmly beforethem,  and not to depart from them.5&apos; In order to make certain that the national interestin the settlement of individual incomes is taken into, full account it is proposed to set up an impartial Central appeal tribunal to which appeals can be taken from any existing   .arbitral tribunal, wages council or similar body dealing withwages and salaries, whether statutory or not, by either -side and to which decisions arrived at by such bodies can bereferred in cases where, it is considered that the national interest has not been taken into full account.      Suchreferences will be made by the Minister of Labour afterconsultation with the National Joint Advisory Council.It is hoped by this means to develop a national wages.Policy through existing machinery which will take intoaccount both the conditions ...a.nd nature of the work and itsrelative importance in the national economy.During the past few years the share of the salarjrand wage-earners of the national income has markedly-increased and it is not the Government&apos; s intention that there-should be any reversal of this trend.      Their object is toprevent an inflationary rise of total incomes&quot;while at the&apos;same time working towards a distribution of the total amongstthose in different occupations more in accord with thenational needs.6. The relation which different individual incomesbear to one another must no longer be determined by somehistorical development of the past, but by the urgent needsof the moment.
The Government cannot too strongly emphasise thispoint.      It&apos; has hitherto been customary to consider certainoccupations as having the right to a relative superiority of income over other occupations for no other reason thanthat this relation between the incomes has been maintained in the past.Attempts made to bring up the lower income have resulted in an almost automatic increase in the higherincome also and the difference instead of being eliminatedhas instead been perpetuated.In the changed world of.today and with our present economic difficulties these old relationships of incomehave no relevance,. - and must for the very sake of oursurvival be altered the better to conform to the national interest.7. In general and in conclusion,  if rises in prices,which are themselves only the measure of a greater scarcity of goods,  are made the occasion of a succession of generalincreases in individual money incomes, no more goods aremade available thereby and no-one can obtain any realbenefit except the black market operator.      The rest of thecommunity has to endure the dislocation and hardship which_inevitably accompanies inflation..      In short,  the alternativesnow before us are a general agreement by the people to actupon sound lines or economic and social disaster.
