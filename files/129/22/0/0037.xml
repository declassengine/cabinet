J. N.-B.Commonwealth Relations Office,Sth December, 1947.ANNEXURESecretSecretary of State,Talks with Southern Rhodesia ministers annex a note summarising discussions held with Southern RhodesiaMinisters recently.2. The chief points that emerged from the long and detailed talks we had with Southern Rhodesia Ministers and their advisers were :-(a) They are extremely loyal and friendly to this country and will help it inevery possible way, They are suspicious of the Union of South africa and are frightened that it might one day be neutral. They appearedvery satisfied with the talks and with the trouble we took.__________L.(b) They had done practically no detailed thinking on the development ofthe Colony. They had grandiose general ideas and a just sense of the potential wealth of Southern Rhodesia : but practically nothing hasbeen worked out even to the point at which it can be intelligentlydiscussed. We had to spend hours in getting answers to questions that ought to have been made clear on paper before ever they got here.What papers they brought with them (e.g., on the cost of the WalvisBay Railway project) were worthless.It soon became clear that we must concentrate ;on getting issues clarified and intoorder of priority and practicability.3.   The two urgent problems are : (a) To; get a speed-up at Beira, the chief sea-outlet;(&amp;) To get rolling-stock and locomotives on to the railways.We managed, after much talk, to get the Beifa issues clarified. The essentialdecisions are in Portuguese hands.  We are asking Lisbon to accept a Southern34654 copy No. 3 i
/ 2Rhodesian delegation, to which we will attach one or two experts. In the mean-time the Ministry of Transport is sending out one of its best experts (who was present at all the meetings) to try and get things moving quicker at the port.He will then go with the delegation to Lisbon.More rolling-stock is undoubtedly the first urgent necessity.   It will yieldimmediate dollar returns as there are stock-piles of chrome waiting to be moved.It will also get coal to the copper-belt in Northern Rhodesia and enable theQue Que Iron and Steel works and new Cement works in Southern Rhodesia to-start working.Southern Rhodesia Ministers expressed themselves satisfied that everything possible is being done to speed up delivery of rolling-stock from this country.4. Once the Rhodesia Railways are working to capacity (or even before)the problem of a port will become acute. It seems that Beira and the railwayfeeding it will at the best have a limited capacity. This capacity will be taxedas projected agricultural development in the Sabi area gets going.The central problem is that anything like full industrial development in southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia won&apos;t be able to find its way to the sea.A small relief will come from fuller use of the railway to Lobito Bay.Southern Rhodesia Ministers clearly have an objection to using outlets in non-British hands. We urged on them the absolute necessity of making the utmostuse of Lobito Bay. But it seems that only very limited quantities can be carriedthis way.A further small relief might be got over South African lines : but this involves a long and expensive haul and these lines are busy and over-burdened. In thefuture this relief may become more important.5. It seems clear to me that in the end a new outlet will have to be found.Southern Rhodesia Ministers are very keen on the line to Walvis Bay. We foundin discussion (as appears in the report) that they had done no preparatory workwhatever.  We managed to get the difficulties clarified.We insisted that the first thing of all must be talks between SouthernRhodesia and the Union of South Africa and the High Commissioner of Basuto-land, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland through whose territories thelines would run. Once this was settled, we said we would be glad (if invited)to send a mission of experts to help investigate the whole problem of southern rhodesian economic development, including this particular project. We foundthat Southern Rhodesia has started up a number of rather loosely co-ordinatedenquiries.  We offered to fit in with these as well as possible.The Ministry of Defence representative at our meetings said the WalvisBay scheme would have strategic value, but not enough to justify expenditure by the United Kingdom Government. I have the feeling that the strategic valuemay be greater than this if we come to need lateral transport across Africa inBritish territory. But this, like everything else, must depend upon surveys, &amp;o,that establish the practicability of the project. We impressed this on SouthernRhodesia Ministers.  No one has the foggiest idea of costs, probable traffic, &amp;c.6. In the meanwhile Southern Rhodesia will have to get on with existingoutlets. The most optimistic Southern Rhodesian guess (and it was nothing more) was 7-10 years before the Walvis Bay scheme could work.This means that there is no early prospect whatever of coal exports. Coaljust could not be carried; and even if it were, it would crowd out other products of far higher intrinsic and dollar value. The chief products that can earn dollarsare chrome (in Southern Rhodesia) and copper (in Northern Rhodesia). iSouthernRhodesia Ministers agreed that, if chrome exports are maintained at a sufficientlevel to maintain the trade, thereafter ton for ton copper is a more valuable dollarsaver than chrome. Copper production in Northern Rhodesia is at present held up by coal shortage, which is itself almost entirely due to shortage of rolling-stock.Coal will, therefore, have to be developed for a considerable period for internalindustrial use. This could lead to greatly increased output of chrome, iron andsteel, copper and to greater use of the railways. The proposed Kariba or KafueHydro-electric schemes (both still somewhat vague) would also stimulate internalindustrial development.7. The large-scale plans for agricultural development in the Sabi area were discussed between Southern Rhodesia Ministers and the Ministry of Food.Detailed reports and surveys have yet to be made. If everything is satisfactorythere is a possibility of financial aid from the Overseas Food Corporation.
8. Even if all these plans turn out to be as good as hoped (and we should^know a good deal more in a year) an upper limit will be set by the transport and port problem. The more successful and rapid the industrial development ofSouthern Rhodesia, the more urgent will become the problem of a port. A longer-lasting limit may be set by a shortage of native labour.9. In a year or so the Government here may have to face the problem of how far we can permit Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia to raise capitalon the London market. In the talks we said we could not answer this problemtill it arose.P. C. G.-W.3rd December, 1947.Summary of Discussions with Southern Rhodesia Ministers 14th to25th November, 1947General discussions have taken place between a delegation from SouthernRhodesia led by the Prime Minister, Sir Godfrey Huggins (who was accompaniedby the Minister of Finance, the Honourable &quot;F. E. Whitehead and by senior officials), and representatives of the United Kingdom Government under theChairmanship of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, Mr. Gordon &quot;Walker. Discussions on particular topics have also beenheld between Mr.Whitehead and individual United Kingdom GovernmentDepartments.The conversations, which began on the 14th and ended on 26th November,covered a wide field. They can be grouped under the following four heads : (1) Southern Rhodesia&apos;s overall balance of payments position.(2) Internal transport and port facilities.(3) Industrial priorities.(4) Long-term development schemes.A summary of the discussions under each head is as follows : 1. Balance of Payments(a) GeneralThe Southern Rhodesia Ministers said that they were fully alive to the needfor achieving a satisfactory balance of payments position. 1947 had been a difficult year owing to the drought which involved the Colony in heavy andunexpected purchases of maize. This situation was not likely to recur in theimmediate future. To the credit side stood large orders for chrome from theUnited States; the cancellation of all orders for non-essential goods not shipped from hard-currency areas by 19th November; sterling investments from outside and capital transfers made by new settlers.(b) Dollar expenditure the Southern Rhodesia Ministers reported that the colony&apos;s net estimates for the period 1st October, 1947, to 30th June, 1948, were dollar expenditure 4 m., dollar earnings (including total gold production)  4^ m. Before theimposition of strict import control on dollar goods dollar expenditure was estimated at  6^ m.On the United Kingdom side appreciation was expressed of the action takenby the Southern Rhodesian Government to limit dollar expenditure to themaximum possible extent in respect both of direct imports and of imports via theUnion. The Southern Rhodesia Ministers recognised that in . presentcircumstances it is of vital importance that each country, in the sterling area should play its part in safeguarding the reserves of the whole, and thatany sterling area country which is in a position- to do so should make a net contribution to the central gold and dollar reserves of the area. On the aboveestimates Southern Rhodesia should be able to make a small contribution to thosereserves, and the hope was expressed by the United Kingdom representatives thatthe Colony would not only achieve this contribution, but, if possible, increase it.As regards the future expansion of dollar earning output it was agreed that therewould be no question of Southern Rhodesia receiving less favourable treatment34654 b 2
/4because the dollars came through increased Northern Rhodesian exports and notdirect.It was mentioned that the United Kingdom Government were inviting theSouthern Rhodesia Government to join in arrangements which are being made within the Commonwealth for the exchange of progress reports at regular meetings in London, with the object of ensuring that full and up-to-date information on all matters affecting sterling is contiuously available. TheSouthern Rhodesia Ministers said that their Government would be ready toco-operate.(c) Sterling BalancesAs custodian of the ultimate financial reserves of the Sterling area, the UnitedKingdom Government are concerned by the indirect pressure on these reserves which can arise by reductions of balances held in sterling in London by membersof the sterling area and others. To meet this problem it is necessary for the UnitedKingdom Government either to negotiate formal agreements or to request theGovernment concerned to follow a policy designed to ensure the maintenance ofexisting balances. The Southern Rhodesia Ministers were asked to follow thelatter policy.During the first six months of this year, Southern Rhodesia&apos;s overall adverse balance of trade on current account was met by capital investments, funds of immigrants and net tourist traffic receipts.. During the third quarter of the year,however, the balances held, by the Rhodesia-Nyasaland currency union have notreflected an increase corresponding to the amount made available by the raising of the new Railway Loan, and some drawing down of the previously existingbalances is thus indicated. The Southern Rhodesia Ministers said that their government would, for its part, wish to see the size of the balances at leastmaintained, and that they would be prepared to continue to watch the positionclosely with the object of taking corrective action, should, this prove necessary.2. Internal Transport and Port FacilitiesDiscussions covered : (a) supplies of rolling-stock; (b) congestion at Beira;(c) the question of a West Coast port.(a) Rolling-Stock&apos;The Southern Rhodesia Ministers reported that Rhodesia Railways had placed substantial orders in the United Kingdom for locomotives and wagons.1947 shipments were almost complete, but mounting internal production and theneed to move coal to the Northern Rhodesia copper belt were imposing a continuingstrain on the internal transport position. Diversion of rolling-stock to carry maizehad added to the problems. The Southern Rhodesia Ministers added that theyhad been given serious consideration to a suggestion put forward to the canadian minister of Commerce, who had recently visited the Colony, that SouthernRhodesia should accept a loan from Canada for the purchase of railway rolling-stock for which, the Canadian firms concerned would guarantee early delivery.It appeared, however, from discussions which took place between the SouthernRhodesia delegation on the one hand and the Ministry of Supply and supplyfirms on the other, that in fact the prospect of supplies from the United kingdom were more favourable than was previously thought. Wagon deliveries wouldcommence in the first half of 1949 and subject to steel availability, an additional10-20 locomotives could be supplied over the same period. In these circumstances the Southern Rhodesia Ministers said that they did not propose to proceed withthe Canadian suggestion. The High Commissioner for Southern Rhodesia would,however, keep the Commonwealth Relations Office informed of developments as tothe deliveries with a view to seeking assistance if necessary.(b) BeiraThe Southern Rhodesia Ministers made it clear that whilst internal transport was one of their most difficult problems, no increase of rolling-stock, howevergreat, could provide a solution unless and until further port facilities became available. Beira, which was at present the chief port for Northern and SouthernRhodesia and Nyasaland, was hopelessly congested. The United Kingdom repre-sentatives suggested that, as an immediate remedial measure, a Ministry ofTransport officer should proceed to Beira to advise on means of speeding up the turn-round of shipping. The Southern Rhodesia Ministers gladly accepted this offer.
The present position is that a British company, Beira Works Limited, controls the port installations. Another British firm, Beira Railways Limited, owns therailway running between Beira and the Portuguese East African border, but therailway is operated by Rhodesia Railways. The Portuguese Government have since 31st December, 1946, had the right to expropriate Beira Works Limitedon payment of compensation. The Beira Railway Company&apos;s concession stillhad nine years to run. In addition to the difficulties arising out of the aboveposition the need to raise further capital for the development of the port andpossibly the railway is urgent. A mixed commission of Portuguese and Britishengineers had recommended that for port development between  1 million and 2 million would be required immediately and  3 million to  4 million as asecond step in the near future. When the second stage of port development isreached, further capital might be required for improvements on the BeiraRailway.It was agreed with the Southern Rhodesia representatives (a) that BeiraWorks Limited in its present uncertain position could not raise on its own creditthe required capital which, with the sums required for the conversion of thecompany&apos;s debentures, would amount to  7 million in all; (b) that discussionsought to take place at an early date with the Portuguese Government as to thefuture of the concession to Beira Works Limited and as to improvements to theport facilities. With this in view it was agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Lisbon, should ask the Portuguese Government whether they would be preparedto receive a delegation consisting of representatives of the Southern rhodesia government and of the port and railway companies. The United Kingdom fortheir part, would be very willing to lend such technical assistance as might besought. It was felt that before such discussions opened, further talks shouldtake place in London in order that the Government and commercial interestsshould co-ordinate the approach to the Portuguese authorities.ic) West Coast ports the Southern Rhodesia Ministers pointed out that, even with the improve-ments now contemplated, Beira would never fully meet the needs of SouthernRhodesia for port facilities, and their view was that a port on the west coastwould also become essential. They envisaged that with the limited facilities atBeira and the development of the coal, copper and chrome industries the naturaloutlet for &quot;heavy&quot; exports was via the West Coast. On a short-term basisLobito Bay, in Portuguese West Africa, could be used to assist and the general manager of the Rhodesia Railways undertook to look into the possibility of importing United Kingdom railway equipment through this port, and to examinea suggestion by Tanganyika Concessions Limited that they might be able tocarry an additional 2,000 tons of freight per month on this route. But LobitoBay could not offer a permanent solution. What the Southern RhodesiaMinisters had in mind was to secure an outlet to the sea at or near Walvis Bay.The cost of such a project could not, however, be accurately estimated untildetailed investigations had taken place.It was made clear to the Southern Rhodesia Ministers that the UnitedKingdom authorities were in general sympathy with Southern Rhodesia&apos;s desireto find in the long run an alternative outlet to Beira. So far as the WalvisBay project was concerned, it was agreed that, before any other steps were taken,the Southern Rhodesia Government would have to discuss the matter in detail with the Union Government and obtain their agreement in principle, since partof the railway or port would be in South West Africa. They would also haveto discuss with the High Commissioner for the Bechuanaland Protectorate theposition as to that part of the projected line which would pass through theterritory, with special reference to the position as to the Protectorate under theSouth Africa Act of 1909. If these enquiries had a favourable outcome, it wouldbe necessary for the Southern Rhodesia Government to prepare a scheme inoutline dealing with such points as the best route for the line, its possible cost,the method of raising the necessary finance and its financial prospects bearing that mind the interests of the other two Governments participating in the RhodesiaRailway Authority, the approximate amount of materials which would have tobe imported, and the time required for the completion of the work. The UnitedKingdom Government for their part would be happy to examine any such schemesprepared on these lines, and to offer technical and financial advice, in its prepara-tion. In brief the possibilities will call for -the most careful investigation before decisions are taken.
3. Industrial PrioritiesIt was explained to the. Southern Rhodesia Ministers that, ton for ton, copper,chrome and coal ranked in that order as dollar earners. Whilst agreeing to main-tain supplies of coal to the copper belt at the agreed target figure, the SouthernRhodesia Ministers drew attention to the need for maintaining their own chromeexports at a satisfactory level. They pointed out that their chrome exports werehandicapped by lack of adequate port facilities; that large&apos; stock-piles wereaccumulating, and that the Union of South Africa was in the meantime shippinglow grade chrome to the United States. Should the United States alter theirplants to handle low grade chrome the long-term effect would be to create apermanent loss to the dollar pool. Granted, however, that chrome exports weresatisfactorily maintained, Southern Rhodesia Ministers were prepared to recqg-nise the priority of copper as a dollar earner.4. Long-Term Development schemes the Southern Rhodesia Ministers said that, apart from transport schemes,the Colony had three major development projects in view: (a) the WankieCollieries; (b) the Kariba and/or Kafue Hydro-Electric Scheme; (c) the SabiRiver Irrigation Scheme.(a) Wankie CollieriesThe Southern Rhodesia Ministers said that estimated deposits of coal stood at 4,000 million tons. Southern Rhodesia&apos;s competitive position was good. Coalcost 9s. per short ton at the pit head, and the estimated cost f .o.b. at Walvis Bay,if a railway existed, was tentatively estimated at 35s. Over the next six-year.period production could be further increased to 8 million tons per annum. - Inview, however, of the demands arising from the internal industrial developmentof Northern and Southern Rhodesia; of the present port congestion, and of thehigher dollar earning value of copper and chrome, it was agreed that over thenext few years increased coal output could most profitably be absorbed by localindustries.(b) The Kariba scheme the Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia Governments have enteredinto an agreement with Sir Dennis Burney and his associates for an investigation into the possibilities of a hydro-electric scheme at the Kariba Gorge on the ZambeziRiver and of the railway facilities which would be required to service it, as wellas adjacent areas in the two territories carrying coal, iron ore and chrome ore.An alternative scheme on similar lines on the Kafue River in Northern Rhodesiais also under investigation by a joint inter-territorial hydro-electric commission.Should reports show either or both of these schemes to be sound and economicalit would be for the two Governments to consider the construction of a dam, power station and railway, the Company to construct works for the production of pigiron and steel and ferro-chrome and other chrome ore products. The cost of thehydro-electric project and of the iron and steel works has provisionally been estimated at  23 million, of which  5 million would be borne by the associatecompanies. ^ ;The Southern Rhodesia Ministers gave it as their view that the Karibaproject would take something over five years to complete.They had been informed by the Ministry of Supply that, provided firm ordersfor the Electrical Generating plant could be placed during 1948, the orders couldbe carried out in the three years 1953-55.(c) Sabi RiverThe Southern Rhodesia Ministers stated that this project is in its early stages. The first reports were promising, but that the engineers&apos; survey wouldnot be ready until March 1948. The aim was to bring 500,000 acres of land under mixed farming for the production of food-stuffs. The Colony might thus become not only self-supporting in food but in a position to enter the export market. It would take five years to bring this project into operation and thepreliminary estimate of the cost was  6 million. The Southern Rhodesia ministers had discussed the matter with the Ministry of Food, the members designate ofthe Overseas Food Corporation and the Ministry of Supply.   The hope had been
expressed by the Southern Rhodesia Ministers that the Overseas Food Corporationmight be in a position to help as regards finance.In connection with the general agricultural development of the ColonySouthern Rhodesia Ministers stated that they had had a discussion whilst in theUnited Kingdom with the Board of Trade with regard to the provision ofagricultural machinery for which orders had been placed in this country. Theyhad given the Board of Trade a complete list of their requirements and hadreceived an assurance that the Board would do their best to ensure and to expeditedelivery.The Southern Rhodesia Ministers made it plain that they were anxious topress forward with these development projects as soon as practicable, but statedthat Southern Rhodesia alone could not finance them. Including railway and port development schemes, they would cost anything up to  60 million. TheUnited Kingdom authorities pointed out that until receiving (a) firm costestimates; (b) a forecast of the time when capital equipment would be required;(jc) an idea of the sources from which various types of equipment was likely tocome; and (d) a forecast of when and to what extent concrete advantages were likely to accrue from the various schemes were available they could not, particu-larly at this early stage, form any firm views as to how finance might be provided.The United Kingdom Government was, however, most anxious to give allassistance possible to the development of Southern Rhodesia, and the question was discussed whether it would be helpful if at the invitation of the SouthernRhodesia Government, the United Kingdom Government were to make availableexperts to examine the various development schemes and to advise as to possibili-ties and respective priorities. Southern Rhodesia Ministers mentioned that sir Miles Thomas, who had invited certain experts to assist him, was already engaged on a task of this nature. But they gratefully took note of the UnitedKingdom representatives&apos; suggestion, and promised to communicate further withregard to it.Commonwealth Relations Office,2Uh November, 1947.
