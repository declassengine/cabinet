EVELYN WALKDM, M.P.  &apos;Note by the Secretary of the CabinetI circulate herewith s cOpy of a telegram receivedfrom the Attorney General commenting on the proposals putforward by the Lord President of the Council in his memorandum C. P. (1+7) 290.(Signed)    NORMAN BROOKCOPY NO. si-Cabinet Office, S.W.1.,22nd October,  19U7.
annex copy OF TELEGRAM FROM THE ATTORNEY general  -have just received a copy of the Lord President&apos;smemorandum on the report of the Committee of Privileges andhave &quot;been asked to furnish an immediate comment upon it.As the memorandum differs from the majority report of theCommittee (in which the three leading lawyers of the threepolitical parties concurred)  I cannot of course be expectedto agree with it, nor could I, as a member of the Committee,readily acquiesce in the view that Sir Gilbert Campion&apos;sconfidential conclusions should carry more weight than thoseof the Committee itself given after hearing his public testimony.I do not think therefore that I can at this stage usefully offerany detailed comment on the Lord President&apos;s memorandum &quot;beyond those which I expressed on the original draft which he was good enough to shew me.Whilst however I hove a great, respect for Sir, Gilbert&apos;slong experience in -these matters,  I feel bound to soy that drtis difficult to reconcile his present memorandum with some ofhis .oral evidence before the Committee,  quite new though someof his points are.      I shall not attempt to traverse the wholeof Sir Gilbert&apos;s memorandum but.I cannot help feeling that onreflection he would himself wish to resile even from the secondthoughts expressed in it,  if he were further examined by theCommittee.      Thus in paragraph 11  he says that Mr.  Allighan&apos;s&quot;conduct in receiving money for the betrayal of confidential information, though not strictly a breach of privilege could and should be punished&quot;.      But that conduct was either a breach of privilege or it was not.      If it was not, manifestly it shouldnot he punished,  even if the separate and distinct offence(with which Mr.  ^llighan was not charged) of giving misleadingevidence, merited punishment.      As to that,  in paragraph 11,Sir Gilbert says    that &quot;taken in conjunction with his sellingof secrets, I think the House1 would agree that suspension ...would not be too severe Attention has only to bo drawn to the point, for it to be appreciated that it would be whollyimproper for the House to take anything nln conjunction withthe selling of secrets&quot; unless the selling of secrets were a parliamentary offence as the Committee considered,  andSir Gilbert,  as far.as I can understand, does not.      I say sofar as I understand, because when one comes to paragraph 1hof his memorandum,  Sir Gilbert does moke a suggestion which,most unfortunately, he did not, I think, ever-make to theCommittee and does say that Mr. Alllghan should be punishedfor his &quot;corrupt betrayal of confidence&quot;.      But if Mr. Allighandid not accept a bribe in relation to his conduct as a member.-.-his conduct was, as I see it, not corrupt in any proper sense;of that term and I should have thought that it was quite wrong for the House to discipline him for what was on this view merulya breach of party rules.      I cannot believe that this attemptto reach a similar result to the majority of the Committee bya rather devious route would commend itself to the minoritywho if I remember correctly (I write from New York without anypapers by me)  objected to the House enforcing discipline for theparty.      &quot;Selling secrets&quot; seems to me to be as irrelevant,  so
far os Parliament is concerned,  as selling apples unlessParliamentary conduct is involved.These errors, os I conceive them to &quot;be,  in SirGilbert&apos;.s memorandum hove of course &quot;been translated -into theLord President&apos;s paper.      Thus,  in paragraph 10,  it is pointedout that the Committee found Mr.  gllighan guilty of acceptinga bribe and it is said &quot;...  and by selling secrets, Mr.  /,llighonwas undoubtedly guilty of disgraceful conduct likely to bringthe House into contempt11.      But the Parliamentary offence of accepting a bribe only exists and soiling secrets only bringsthe House into contempt, if it is done by the member in his capacity as a member,  as the majority of the Committee thoughtit wes. .    That of course was the whole point of their conclusionas to the bribe.      Similarly the last of the draft motionsin paragraph 13 refers to Mr.  gllighan &quot;corruptly acceptingpayment ....  is guilty of dishonourable conduct ....  tending tobring this House into contempt&quot;.      Again my comment is thaton the authorities this is a non sequitur unless the conductwas conduct in the capacity of a member.      Conduct in a privatecapacity may reflect grave discredit on the member concerned and render him unfit for the service of the House..     It doesnot bring the House into contempt.I do not think it is necessary to be dismayed bythe&apos;various hypothetical consequences which it is feared might follow from the adaption of the Committee&apos;s view.      Those cases would have to be. dealt with when  (if ever) they arose,  and th.House can be trusted.not to extend its decisions to circumstances in which it would be inexpedient to apply them,  and to applycommon sense in the matter.      It is not necessary either tofollow precedents too slavishly in this matter,   or to refrain from finding that the privileges of the House ore involvedbecause there is no exact precedent in point.      But in my view the decision of, the Committee is amply justified bg the principleof the Sandys case which whether concurred in by Sir Gilbert  jvnot was unanimously accepted, by the House.New York,21st October,   1947.
