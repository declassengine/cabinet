-    253gtat:.;ki]nt by sir qiiviir franks on the Marshall planI.      Introductory RemarksSIR OLIVER PRiiNKG said that there were three main phasesin the development. of the Marshall Plan.    The first phase ;consisted of the work that had been done in Paris in getting a picture of what the European countries could do for- themselves and what they needed in the way of American aid.    The second phase was the phase which was now going on in Washington, thepreparation of the draft Bills for presentation to Congressauthorising the aid to be given to Europe;    this stage had nowgot far enough to enable it to be said that the Bill to be presented would bear a recognisable resemblance to the &quot;ParisReport.    The third phase consisted .of the almost endlessdiscussion that would take place in the Foreign Committees andon the Floor of the Senate of the House of Representativesbefore the Bill could finally be adopted.    During this stagealmost everything possible that could be said about Europe&quot;would be said, including some unpleasant things would be writteninto the Bill as &quot;strings&quot; on the use of supplies furnishedthrough the Marshall Plan.    Our objective during this phase wouldbe to try to avoid the more objectionable conditions and make do with the less objectionable conditions, recognising that it was inevitable that some conditions must be attached to any aid that ^would be granted. I-This morning he proposed to deal in. more detail with thesecond phase in the development of the plan.2*      Objectives of the Group sent to WashingtonThe group sent on behalf of the Paris Conference to Washington -Were sent with authority to explain and elucidate the provisions and intentions of the Paris Report.    The group consisted of theChairman and Rapporteur of the Paris Conference plus representativesof various national delegations.    They found an immense organisation in Washington already working on the European recovery programme and centred, in the State Department under the direction ofMr. Lovett, the Assistant Secretary of State, who was Acting   .Secretary during the frequent absences of Mr. Marshall.    Under him the &quot;delegation found an Inter-departmental Steering Committee withMr. Bonesteel in the Chair.    This Committee was well organised and working harmoniously with a sense of common purpose.    Itincluded, representatives of the Treasury,  the Department ofCommerce j, the Department of the Interior, the War Department anathe Navy Department.    Under this there were an enormous number of sub-committees dealing with various special subjects and aspects,but there the organisation was relatively poor and many of thecommittees had a very imperfect appreciation of what had been donein Paris. &apos; j&quot;3.. . First Impressions . .* The first impressions of the European delegation were:-(a) that the administration was very much inearnest and very friendly.;(b) that the Administration was completelyunconvinced that the work done in Paris       ;.had been really useful from their pointof view.
254The Administration realised that a lot of the requirementsstated in the Paris Report would.cause difficulty.    They wereafraid of the Republican majority in. Congress and quite uncertainon what basis they ought to go forward with a Bill.4.     Position of *bhe European GroupThe group included about forty people with representatives,for example, from Prance, Italy, Holland, Norway and Greece aswell as Great Britain, some being general.administrators andothers specialists.    The reasons for the size, of the group were:-(i) in order to carry the confidence of the16 countries represented at Paris, and(ii) to make it clear to the United states administration that this was a european and not a national group and for thispurpose care was taken that no one country, particularly the United Kingdom,should appear to be. too obviously in the lead.5.      Organisation of the discussions the requirements stated in the Paris Report -had been built up.on a double analysis.    In the first instance requirements were stated for four main categories of materials:-(a) Pood, feedingstuffs, fertilisers, agricultural machinery. .  .(b) Goal, oil and electricity. -(c) Iron and steel.(d) Manufactured goods.Secondly,  it was necessary to state the requirements of essential materials not covered under these heads,  such as raw cotton, and no -ferrous metals .. For the purpose of discussing the details the Americansestablished a number of quas i t e c hn ic a 1 committees, each of whichconsidered one of the main commodity sections indicated above.6. .   Harriman CommitteeThe delegation.found the United States Administration-nervousin view of the possible-attitude of the Harriman Committee, whichwas a Committee , of nineteen non-Official members who had been giventhe task of surveying all the resources of the United. States to see,what help the United States authorities could give.    TheAdministration arranged for various, members of the Harriman Committee
to be add&amp;d to the various Official Committees that weredealing with the different, aspects of the Paris Report. Theresult was that in the discussions two or three Europeanrepresentatives would have to face committees of 25 to 40people, some of them officials and others not.7.     Principles of the Paris ReportIn the early stages of the discussion there had beenmany questions about the basic principles of the Paris Report,and about whether it conformed to the original Marshallinitiative, the purpose of which was to see what Europe could do for itself, what help was needed and how that help could bepaid for.    In this part of the discussion the European Groupfound that to begin with the United States representatives had no clear distinction in their minds between a reliefprogramme, intended to keep the people alive with the minimumamount of food, heat and clothing, and a recovery programme,-intended to enable the countries concerned to build up theireconomies so that at the end of the period of assistance theywould be viable economic entities.    The. Paris Report was basedon the second principle of establishing a recovery programme and required, in addition to food and coal, products such assemi-finished steel which was of great importance for example,to the United Kingdom which had a greater finishing capacity for steel than could be supplied from its own sources of semi-finished steel.    This aspect of the Par is Plan brought the americans up against a real problem for the United, States wasitself short of steel.    The chief profits in the&quot;steel trade were at the finishing end and if the United States were tosupply semi-finished steel to Great Britain this would be manufactured into engineering products which might latercompete with American goods in foreign markets, such as ,the Argentine.  ,  Therefore the Group had to work hard inorder to convince the United States representatives thatif the Marshall Plan,was to achi&amp;ve its aim it must be a recovery programme in this, sense, and must involve building up the competitive capacity of the European countries evenagainst the United States.8.      Inter-relation of the sections of the Paris ReportAnother difficulty that the European Group had found at first was that the United States authorities did notappreciate that, the various sections of the Paris report had been related to each other, for example, that the..........steel programme had taken&quot;account of the coal supplies thatwould be needed to achieve it, that the shipbuilding programme had taken account of the amount of steel that would berequired.     It was true that the Paris plan was1not perfect:-
256(a) It involved four years crystal gazing.(b) It had to be completed in eight weeks.(c) It had to be agreed by 16 nations.Neverthelesss with all its faults it was a coherent plan andby much discussion the European Group had finally convinced the United States Administration that this was so.    after about a month this had an almost startling effect on theattitude of the United States Administration and eventuallyMr. Lovett had told the European Group that the administration had now decided.to accept the main linos.of the Paris report as the basis of their proposals to Congress.9..    Possible reference back to Paris..     Tho original invitation to the European Group had. boohto go&apos; to the United States for nine or. ten days.    The ideahad been that after the Group had heard the views of theUnited States on the problem generally arid been given detailsof what the United States were in a position to do,  they should then go back to Europe and that tho Paris Conference shouldbe re-convened to revise the plan.      It had been the ^objectof the delegation to convince tho United States authorities that this was unwise for general political reasons.    It hadbeen no easy task to get all 16 nations to sign the reportwithout reservations, and If another conference wore calledwithout any definite guarantee that United States &quot;assistance would he available at the end. of its  it would be impossibleagain to&apos; get a unanimous agreement.    Some of the countries,like Switzerland and Portugal, had no very acute need for aid from the United States.&apos;   Switzerland was anxious on account ofits historic neutrality not to appear to be favouring theWest against the East,  and the Scandinavian countries were extremely worried about the apparent split in Europe.Therefore another European Conference called in thesecircumstances would almost certainly have failed,    Finally the americans were convinced of this and also realised thattheir, own timetable would hardly permit of a. further conference in Europe.10.    Underlying assumptions in the Paris Report.Certain points had been inherent in the Paris report but not very obviously &quot;brought out and it had been necessary-to explain and expound these principles to the United States...representatives.    The three points concerned were the total amount of aid, the place of third countries in the western hemisphere and the question of local currencies.- 4t&quot;
257The Paris Report put the requirements of the Suropeancountries over a four-year period at an order of magnitude of 22 thousand million dollars.    A certain part of this wasto cover -long-term capital- equipment which might perhaps heprovided through the machinery of the International Bank,leaving just under 20 thousand million dollars to he dealtwith by direct action &quot;by the United States Government.    TheEuropean Group had boon concerned to show that a fullrecovery programme did require assistance of this order of magnitude, including the amount of assistance shown in thereport on difficult items such as oil and steel.,(b)    Third countries in the Western Hemisphere.The plan required imports on a scale especially offood,- which could not he made from the United States alonebut required imports of about the same amount from canada and Latin America, imports for which it would be necessaryto pay mainly in dollars.     A full recovery programme wasnot &quot;possible for Europe unless efforts were made&apos; to financean adequate, volume of trade with these countries as well asdirect with the United States.    This involved a very difficultpolitical problem for the United States authorities.    Tostate it in simple terms, a Kansas farmer might he preparedto devote part of his time to working without payment for europe, in the sense that the value of that labour was taken from him in federal, taxation in order to pay for supplies for.Europe, hut he would&apos; not&apos;he so willing to do this if&apos; the product of his labour was to be used not to buy and sendU.S. goods to Europe, &quot;but, for example, to buy wheat in the     f-Argentine at a hi-/her price than he could get for his ownwheat in the United States.    In the end, the United states administration were convinced that this third party trade had got to be financed, but what form this assistance might take was still obscure and would probably remain obscure forsome time.      It would be most convenient for example if theUnited Kingdom were given a certain amount of dollars.to goshopping with, hut it wa3 probable that the United States&quot; would insist on co-ordinated purchase and there was some talk aboutthe United States Government Imying from, the rest of theWestern Hemisphere and distributing and selling the goodsthus acquired among the European countries *(c)    Local CurrenciesThe large volume of goods coming to Europe under the ^idprogramme would in the main he distributed through commercialchannels under the aegis of the various national governments.The&apos; inhabitants of those countries would pay for the goods&apos; in.local currency and the United States authorities were extremelyconcerned with what was to he done with the large volume oflocal currency which would he.accumulated in this . way.    Onemajor fear of. the Administration was that this local currency might he used to balance local budgets and thuscontribute to inflation.       The United States Government werehound to require an&apos;assurance that the aid they were giving was,not being aiisiused,  and this was perfectly reasonable.    Itwould be easier to get acceptance for the plan in Congressif it- could he represented as a deal and not a gift, and therewas a tendency to think that local currency might be -regardedas a &quot;quid&quot; for the American   &quot;quo&quot;.      There was, however,  therisk that certain interests in the States would presssupervision to a point at which it would greatly complicate the working of the economic machine of the assisted countries.
258For instance, any condition -that semi-finished steed-provided as part of the Aid Programme should not he usedfor the manufacture of exports which competed with Americanproducts would he highly detrimental to our interests.On the other hand from the European point of view it was clear that there might he serious political difficulties.If large sums in local, currency accrued from the sale ofMarshall goods and there was some doubt about the ownership of these sums, political problems might be created for years to come so long as the sums remained and their finaldisposal was not settled.    Such a situation would be very embarrassing to the national government concerned and toits relations with the United States.    The Group found thatthe United States authorities were more concerned about their own political problems in tho way of applying conditionswhich would be sufficiently strict to meet with the approvalof Congress, and tho Group had therefore had to press hard to make, the United States authorities realise the political,problems for Europe, particularly in tho case of countries where there was a strong Communist party.    It was most undesirable that the United States should try to control the use of local currency built up against the sale ofMarshall goods in such a way as to give pilausibility tothe criticisms of &quot;dollar diplomacy&quot;.    Again on this question there was no final answer yet about what the American proposals would be..    Some conditions would clearly be attached to thedisposal of resources arising from Marshall Aid, but it wasimpossible yet to say what these conditions would be.,11.    Power of the United States PressThose had been the main points on which the EuropeanGroup had to expound their position to ; the United states authorities.       In addition in Washington the press was virtually a third organ of government and. it had been necessaryto spend a very, great deal of time giving, press correspondents&apos;the proper background to the Paris Report.&apos;12.    An,n;lo-Europ:aan- merlean Co-operationIt was very important that the British Government shouldremember that the United States attitude to Great Britain wouldbe very much affected by the way Britain carried out its partof the whole Paris Report.    Particularly the United Statesjudges Britain by her output of coal and by her export of coal to the sixteen countries and this&apos;.was to be remembered wheneverproblems of allocation of coa.1 wore under&apos; consideration.Again if,the plan was to be carried out successfully itwould be necessary to keep the confidence of the european nations.    While no doubt Great Britain must base its policy on the fundamental necessities of British recovery,  therewas a marginal area in which for long-run reasons it might benecessary&quot;to place the general interests of Europe in advanceof immediate short-run British interosts.    Translating thoseremarks into a concrete illustration nothing would be morecrucial in the eyes of the United States nor more important to Europe than the achievement in 1948 of Great Britain&apos;spromise to export 6 million tons of coal to Europe.    In a sense this was the most vital figure in the Paris report.13.    Additional points in reply to questions., Sir Oliver Pranks made thefollowing points(a)    The United States Administration were making preparationsin advance so that the delay between the passing of the AidBill and the receipt of supplies by the sixteen countries
\   259shoald be reduced-to-a-minimum. .  Many of the decisionsvrequired, however, were political in character and could notbe anticipated..    It was probable that bilateral negotiations between the United States and each of the participating countries would begin before tho vote was taken.    Some goodssuch as bulk foodstuffs and, coal, which required little&quot;preparation before movement&apos;, would probably flow as early asJuly.      Capital equipment would not be available for a longtime. .(b) It was most likely that there would be an American agencydealing with programmes and possibly with a certain amount ofprocurement.    There was also likely to be a European agency,whose functions were not yet defined,(c) Aid could come in the form of       (i) a Loan;    (ii) a loan which was substantially the same as a gift, or (iii) agift announced as such.It was probable that aid in respect of food, feeding stuffs,, rawmaterial and coal (but not oil) would be a gift, but it was notat all clear what arrangements would be made for other commodities,  especially manufactured goods.    As a condition of receiving goods in this latter category we.might be asked to expand the colonial production of certain raw materials or tomake available strategic minerals for stock piling. -(d) In the Paris Report the United Kingdom had stated whatinternal resources it would like to have for a full recovery programme, and had not made a bid for aid.    The team had gone to Washington to explain the Report and not to negotiate.The united Kingdom would await an American decision to offeraid.(e) Not all the Americans were fully aware of the,political-difficulties which would be involved if conditions affectingthe sovereignty of the sixteen States were attached to theassistance which was offered.    The Administration in generalwere aware of the problem, but. in some cases were doubtfulwhether countries were capable of socuring the necessaryinternal stabilisation without some external pressure.    we need not fear political conditions in. the simple-minded sense,such as a ban on nationalisation.&quot; Prom the American point ofview, however, Communism was a special case and it was reasonably certain that they would not give aid to any country which was dominated by Communists.(f) There were many influences favouring the close co-operationof the sixteen nations concerned for the five-year period during which Marshall Aid might be&quot;received.    Given.goodleadership by the United Kingdom it was probable that they could-be kept together,(g) Relations between the United Kingdom and the United states would remain of a special character.    In general it would notbe necessary for us//to consider a major modification of our policy in order to conciliate American opinion.    We should haveto be able to define our actions in relation to United state said, but also in relation to our own long-term recovery.    Incertain limited, fields, however, wo should have to actdifferently if we got United States aid, and while we shouldrot be expected to&apos; reduce our standards to the lowest level mparticipating countries, we should need to have some regard tothe situation in those countries before, for example, relaxing the rationing of bread or taking any similar measures.&quot;cabinet Office, S.W. 1*15TH DECEMBER,  1947.
