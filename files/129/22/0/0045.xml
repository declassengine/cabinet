Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1947 23dSECRET Copy No.   3JCP. (47) 33517th December, 1947        &apos;   -CABINETPROCEEDINGS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE united nations, 1947Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsP^dt^ of State on theI agree with Mr. McNeil&apos;s views and&apos; recoiniSrSiti^E. B.Foreign Office, 17ik December, 1947PROCEEDINGS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF  THE united nations, 1947Memorandum by the Minister of state the Assembly was in no way a positive success. We spent ten weeks and,leaving aside Palestine upon which I have invited the Colonial Secretary to writeseparately, there were only four decisions of any importance. These were to setup an Interim Committee, to appoint a frontier commission for Greece, to appoint a supervisory Commission for Korea, and a resolution, unanimously accepted,urging all member States to discourage war-mongering. jOf these only the GreekCommission would have seemed to us at the start of the proceedings to have beenin the general interest:. and there is no use in exaggerating the importance even of that body in the absence of the Slav group. On the other hand there werefewer decisions than last year which were embarrassing or hostile to us and our friends. This was the case, for instance, on most of the colonial issues and evenon the India-South Africa dispute. We also managed to avoid any fruitless,discussion on disarmament and on the presence of British troops in foreigncountries, to say nothing of the revision of the Italian Treaty and&apos; Spain. Thus,in a negative sense at any rate, this year&apos;s Assembly was considerably more successful than last year&apos;s.2. One of the problems arising from the Assembly therefore seems to me to bewhat we can do to shorten the length of the next and subsequent Assemblies.Here I do not think that much help can be expected from improved machinery.The actual servicing of the Assembly, i.e., provision of competent secretarial,assistance, the rapid supply of documents, efficient translation and interpretation,,was adequate and showed a marked improvement - oh any of our previousexperiences. Firm leadership from the Secretary-General might shorten debateor even result in some resolutions being withdrawn from the agenda. I do notthink, however, that this can be expected from Trygve Lie. He was as helpfulas he could be and much more forthcoming to us than he hitherto has been. Ourrelations, I expect, will continue to be close, but we cannot expect any more thanthat he would give us his warnings and listen to our wishes. Leadership is notpossible for him as Secretary-General. I imagine he has given too manyhostages.34680
3. There are minor points which we might take care of by consultation&quot;before the Assembly opens, such as the choice of chairmen. &quot;We should particularlyseek to secure agreement of a firm, business-like person as chairman of thePolitical Committee. This post is, if at all, only less important than the presidency of the Assembly. We should lay it down that it cannot be awardedas a consolation prize.4. We have amended the rules of procedure, which may help a little. Butthere will be no substantial improvement until the organisation develops a sense of perspective and of seemliness. To this end I think we should agree, and letour decision be known in good time, that we will not make available a senior, oreven a semi-senior, Minister for such a period as ten weeks. We should insist that the Assembly must put its important political questions at the beginningof the Agenda so that our Minister, with other Ministers, may be withdrawnwithin four or six weeks to normal and essential duties.5. On the credit side, the Assembly disclosed a most cordial spirit between us and the Commonwealth countries. This was remarked upon by almost all ofthem, and we had informal discussions to try and discover what exactly had contributed to this. There seemed agreement particularly with the Australian,South African and Indian delegations that the discussions on the Assemblyagenda which we had managed to conduct at Canberra had been a decisivecontribution. There was among the same Dominions an anxiety to considerwhether we could not find a device which would enable us each year to havesimilar consultation.6. It must be admitted, of course, that there are dangers in this. the canadians might find the position delicate, yet if the cover was good enoughI have no doubt from my conversations with them that they would come in. TheUnited States might not like it, and certainly the Soviet Union would accuseus of forming some sinister bloc. On balance I hold the risks worth while, and perhaps the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations will consider thissubject. Before leaving the Commonwealth part in the Assembly, I should recordhow well Pakistan and India co-operated. Even in the disagreeable SouthAfrican business the Indians behaved with great moderation and kept us informedall the time of what they were going to do.7. The pressure for preliminary consultation before the Assembly attractsme. The two major disadvantages we suffered at the Assembly were that we were on the defensive against the Soviet Union, and, secondly, that the United Statesdisplayed very little political tactical sense and yet expected us to support themwhenever it came to an impasse. They did not consult us before launching theirInterim Committe proposal, before Marshall made his statement on the veto,or before they announced in Committee later that they would forgo their vetoon the admission of members.8. Now it seems to me probable that if we had adequate advance conversa-tions with the Dominions, the Scandinavians and the Western European Powers(more especially France), keeping the United States informed at all times, we might be able to assert our leadership and dictate the pace of the next Assembly.This could be accomplished by joint agreement to put down a limited numberof resolutions on subjects that seemed to us important. By &quot;limited&quot; I meanthree at the most. The exact procedure would take some working out. It would entail that if we agreed upon Commonwealth consultations these should take placenot later than June, and that the subsequent conversations with the european powers should take place in August. I am confident, however, that such effortswould be politically rewarding.9. Weak though our political and strategic situation may at present be ascompared with that of the United States and the U.S.S.R., our leadership in theAssembly and in the Committees is still largely accepted, if only for the reason that the Americans, who would otherwise assume it, cannot produce public figureswho have any aptitude for public speaking. But because we did not haveresolutions down, it was, for example, left to us to contrive amendments to theSoviet resolution on war-mongering, and the leadership was often exerted behinddoors so that we did not get full political credit for our efforts. The behind-doorstage-managing I therefore suggest should, if possible, take place first, and the leadership could be publicly exhibited.
324010. Three other points ought to be mentioned. The only subjects on whichwe were substantially embarrassed arose out of the Trusteeship Committee. Thereis, of course, a prejudice against the Colonial Powers, and I have no doubt thatthe Soviet Union will continue to exploit this prejudice. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that if we did some propaganda about our Colonial administration theposition would be improved. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, for whoseoutstanding help at the Assembly I am greatly indebted, and I have discussed thissubject and had some correspondence upon it. My colleagues can be assured thathe will pursue this point.11. The second subject is the financing of the United Nations Organisationand its specialised agencies. As instructed, I spoke on this subject in the bluntestterms, and Mr. Kenneth Younger for some seven weeks fought vigorously in committee for reduction. The main opposition to his efforts came from theUnited States, and we should in the course of the next year ask them to considerwhere this thoughtless extravagance, more especially in respect of expenditureon &quot; Information,&quot; extravagance which is quite as bad in some of the specialised agencies as in the United Nations, is leading us.12. Lastly, there was repeated speculation as to whether or not the soviet union would walk out. We could find no reasonable evidence that this was apossibility. Indeed, in some negative ways the Soviet delegation showed ananxiety to co-operate with us as it suited their propaganda purposes. Forexample, they were anxious to limit the debate on Spain and to avoid debate on disarmament and atomic energy. I think the evidence is that they will continueto use similar tactics, retaining their membership primarily for political propa-ganda. Moreover, they must surely calculate that, if they abandon the Organisa-tion, collective security will be organised solely against them, and that, so longas they are present, they can largely defeat any effort bn these lines by the exerciseof their veto.13. In conclusion, I should acknowledge my indebtedness to the UnitedKingdom officials who displayed their usual zeal and tirelessness in servicingus. All my Parliamentary colleagues distinguished themselves, but I should liketo pay particular thanks to the Attorney-General, who, for the last three or four weeks of the Assembly, was working very long hours.H.
