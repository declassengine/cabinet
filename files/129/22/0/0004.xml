THIS   DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  1/LftJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1947SECRET Copy No.  3^    G.P. (47) 29421th October, 1947CABINETPRIORITY OF HOUSING FOR MINERS, AGRICULTURAL workers and KEY WORKERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AREASMemorandum by the Minister of health in accordance with the Cabinefs decision on 9th September, 1947 (CM. (47)75th Conclusions, Minute 4), I have discussed with my colleagues on the HousingCommittee the report by the Chairman of the Materials Committee and the ChiefPlanning Officer (annexed to CP. (47) 249) on means (so far as concerns Englandand Wales) of securing priority for the housing of miners, agricultural workers and key workers in development areas. The Chairman of the Materials Com-mittee and the Chief Planning Officer were present at the discussion.2. We were in general agreement that the recommendations contained inthe report were acceptable as far as they concerned miners and key workers.Discussion turned, therefore, on their application to agricultural housing needs,,and agreement was finally reached on the following points: (1) That there was no evidence at present to show that the provision ofhouses needed for agricultural workers could not safely be left withthe local housing authorities. Steps could always be taken tosupersede a negligent authority if occasion arose.(2) That priority in the supply of materials and components should be givenfor the provision of houses in a limited number of rural areas inaccordance with a list to be supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture.(3) That the Ministry of Agriculture should arrange for an estimate ofthe demands for houses for incoming agricultural workers in each area to be supplied to the local authorities concerned, and to bediscussed with them in relation to their present programmes.(4) That houses should be offered to agricultural workers in accordance withthe procedure outlined in the Memorandum referred to in para-graph 14 below.3. My colleagues may find it convenient if I now briefly review the measures taken, or in hand, to give priority to the housing needs of the workers in thetthree special categories.Miners4l. The National Coal Board have indicated 270 districts in which a totalof some 38,000 new houses for miners are required. They have selected 50 ofthese districts, in which some 28,000 houses are needed, as areas of special priority,and arrangements have been made for focusing attention on those areas. Inparticular, arrangements have been made to give priority to the supply ofmaterials and components required for the completion of houses under construc-tion therein. Conferences have been held regionally to settle with the localauthorities the letting of contracts and the allocation of tenancies. It can, Ithink, be claimed that these arrangements are well in hand and are workingsmoothly. J34426
5. In the areas concerned the number of permanent dwellings completed by local authorities since 1st January is 12,008, and the number of temporary houses completed is 5,787. On the basis of the original housing programme for1947, it was estimated that the total number of dwellings that might becompleted in these areas during the period 1st January, 1947, to 30th June,1948, was about 90,000. It is not possible, as yet, to say how this estimate is!affected by the economic changes which have occurred since the programme was drawn up, but the restrictions on the letting of new contracts elsewhere thanin the priority areas should have the effect of concentrating resources on house-building in those areas.6. The proposed provision included about 11,000 aluminium bungalows fromthe 15,000 to be delivered from the factories in 1948. The extent to which it willbe possible to supply these houses will depend primarily on the availability of sites,but first call upon them is being given to local authorities who have a special needfor houses for miners, and who are able to provide suitable prepared sites in time.High pressure will be maintained continuously to speed up the preparation of sites and construction of slabs.7. In the allocation of tenancies to miners, local authorities are respondingreadily to the representations which I have made to them. In particular, they have accepted allocations of aluminium bungalows for 1948 on the clear understandingthat three out of every four will be offered to miners&apos; families.A agricultural Workers8. The housing needs of agriculture, being more widely dispersed, are moredifficult to estimate precisely. The Minister of Agriculture has estimated that atotal of 60,000 houses will be needed in rural areas by the 1948 harvest, but we haveagreed that a more detailed estimate is required, broken down area by area, inorder that needs may be compared with existing housing programmes and special attention paid to those areas where the need for additional houses is speciallyurgent. It has, therefore, been decided that detailed information on the subject should be obtained by County Agricultural Executive Committees in consultationwith local housing authorities, and the Minister of Agriculture asked for this information by 21st October, 1947.9. The total number of new houses provided in rural districts by 31stAugust, 1947, was 34,802 ; 27,249 permanent and 7,553 temporary. In addition,6,306 dwellings had been provided by conversions and adaptations of existing houses. Of the permanent houses, 12,483 had been provided by rural district councils.who had under construction 31,036. 6,912 more were under constructionby private builders. Local authorities also possessed sites for a further 60,000houses, and had the use of sites for 50,000 more agreed.10.   The following figures show how progress by rural housing authorities^compares with progress made by housing authorities of other types :  Proportion Proportion of Total Housingof Total Programme.Population Tenders houses of country. approved. completed.Per cent. Per cent. Per cent.Large towns and cities (over 75,000)      35-3 28 29Medium towns and cities (25,000-75,000)............      22-0 23 25Small towns (under 25,000)        ...      15-4 22 22L.C.C. and Metropolitan Borouerhs       9-7 9 6Rural authorities   ......     &quot;...      17-6 18 2011. These figures do not include houses built under licence. If they did the proportion of houses built in rural districts would be much higher, but asit is it will be seen that progress made by the rural district councils themselvescompares very favourably in relation to comparative population with that of the urban authorities.12. The supply of traditional houses in rural areas is being supplemented by the programme of 20,000 Airey Rural Houses of non-traditional construction.All these have now been allocated and a special drive has been instituted to accelerate the completion of the programme. A series of county meetings is being held in order to overcome the reluctance of builders to tender for a novel formof construction, and the results of the meetings so far held have been most encouraging.   There is evidence that urban builders are becoming worried about
future contracts and are looking to the Airey House programme to provide themwith employment. It is hoped to have 13,000 Airey Houses in approved tendersby the end of the year, and if this is achieved a substantial number of houses of this type should be ready for occupation by the 1948 harvest.13. In rural areas, as in mining areas, the restriction on the letting ofnew contracts elsewhere should help to accelerate progress with house-building.In addition, arrangements will be made to give special priority in the supply ofmaterials to houses under construction in the areas which are selected as areasof special need, on receipt of the information for which County AgriculturalExecutive Committees have been asked.14. As regards the allocation of houses to agricultural workers, a Memo-randum has now been agreed with the Ministry of Agriculture and fisheries in which rural district councils are reminded of the urgent need to give special priority to agricultural workers in the selection of their tenants. Rural district councils will naturally give precedence to agricultural workers with an establishedhousing need who are already living in their districts, but the Memorandumintroduces a special procedure to secure that when this need has been met, housescan be let to agricultural workers from outside the district. In the past thedifficulty has been that a prospective tenant from outside the district could notbe named until the offer of a house had been made. Under the new procedurehousing authorities will indicate to County Agricultural Executive Committeeswell in advance of the completion of houses how many can be made available forletting to incomers, so that they can be put in touch with applicants. The finalresponsibility for the selection of individual tenants remains of course with thelocal housing authorities.Key Workers in Development Areas15. Local authorities have paid careful attention to the representations which I have made to them with regard to the requirements of houses for keyworkers in development areas, and in certain districts have readily acquiesced in allocating a proportion of their new houses to such workers. There seemsevery reason to believe that the administrative efforts which are being made inthis way will secure all that is necessary for the purpose.A. B.Ministry of Health, S.
