Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1947SECRETCP. (47) 33312th December, 1947CABINETELECTORAL legislation memorandum by the Home secretary the Committee on Electoral Legislation were appointed on 6th Marchr1947 (CM. (47) 26th Conclusions, Minute 7) to consider, in the light of the Reportsof. the Committee on Electoral Registration, the Speaker&apos;s Conference and theCommittee on Electoral Law Reform, what should be the scope and form oflegislation on electoral reform to be introduced in the present session.2. In my memorandum of 3rd July (CP. (47) 193) I reported the conclusionsof the Ministerial Committee on the recommendations of the Committee on electoral Registration, the Speaker&apos;s Conference, and the Interim Report of theCommittee on Electoral Law Reform. The Cabinet at their meeting on 15th July(CM. (47) 61st Conclusions, Minute 3) approved the recommendations of the ministerial Committee and invited me to submit a further report dealing withthe recommendations of the Final Report of the Committee on Electoral law reform and other outstanding points, including those raised in discussion at cabinet.Final Report of the Committee on Electoral Reform3. Annexed is a summary of the recommendations of the Committee on electoral Reform. It will be seen that in the main these deal with technical matters /oi electoral procedure and voting. Subject to what is said below aboutsome of them, they appear to be such as can be accepted and implemented by\the forthcoming Bill.Consolidation of the Law of Elections (Recommendation (i))4. The Ministerial Committee agree that the law of parliamentary andlocal government elections should be consolidated. This will necessarily involvemuch research and take a good deal pi time. The proper course appears to be tomake any necessary amendments to the law by the forthcoming Bill and to leaveconsolidation to a later Session.The Number of A ssentors at Elections (Recommendation (v))5. The recommendation that the number of assentors should be the sameat all elections seems to have been made solely for the sake of uniformity. there appears to be no substantial reason why, for example, as many as eight assentorsshould be required in Rural District and Parish Council elections in England.There would also be objections in Scotland to the adoption ,of the recommenda-tion and the Ministerial Committee recommend that it should not be accepted.Postal Voting at University Elections (Recommendation (xvi) )6. This recommendation does not arise in view of the decision to abolish the University franchise (CM. (47) 61st Conclusions, Minute 3).Counting the Votes (Recommendation (xvii))7. This recommendation deals with two points : first it proposes the prepara-tion of a model cpde of instructions for the use of returning officers, and secondly,that the code should deal with the facilities to be afforded to the counting agents of the candidates.Gopy No.31
The issue of a model code of instructions to returning officers should be ofmaterial assistance in achieving a reasonable degree of uniformity of practiceas regards the method of counting votes.The Ministerial Committee recommend that such a coda should be prepared and that, in particular, it should deal with the facilities to be given to countingagents to inspect the process of counting votes.Candidates&apos; Expenses8. The Speaker&apos;s Conference proposed that the legal maximum scale of candidates&apos; expenses should be a basic figure of  450, plus an allowance inrespect of each voter. This recommendation has been accepted by the Cabinet(CM. (47) 61st Conclusions, Minute 3). -While the Committee on Electoral Law Reform make no recommendation onthe point they state that suggestions were made to them that this basic figure may now be too low in view of the increased cost of printing and other services; andthe same point was made in discussions at the Ministerial Committee. Inparticular, it was suggested that the new limit might impose some hardship oncandidates in constituencies covering large areas, e.g., in Scotland.The Ministerial Committee felt that it would be undesirable to insert aprovision in the Bill increasing the limits recommended by the Speaker&apos;conference, but that further consideration shoujdbe given to the point if in debate there is a substantial body of opinion in favour of an upward revision.Enfranchisement of the Returning Officer (Recommendation (xix))9. Under the existing law the returning officer at a Parliamentary electionmay give a casting vote if there is a tie but may not give an original vote. the ministerial Committee were in agreement with the proposal that in future theresult of an election should be determined by lot in the event of a tie. This wouldmean, however, that the returning officer would be entirely deprived of the rightto give a vote and to remedy this the Ministerial Committee recommend that the returning officer should be given an original vote at a Parliamentary election.Failure of a Candidate to appoint an Election A gent (Recommendation (xxx))10. In the view of the Ministerial Committee the proposal that, if a candidate fails to appoint either another person ^or himself as his election agent,he should be deemed to have withdrawn, goes too far; and instead they recommendthat in such an event the candidate should be deemed to act as his own agentand to have accepted the normal responsibilities of an election agent,Costs of Election Petitions (Recommendation (xxxvi))11. This recommendation is designed to relieve the political parties or private individuals of the cost of an election petition (which at present they mustmeet) by requiring a public official, once a prima facie case has been established,to take over the proceedings and conduct them at public expense.The proposals are very tentative, and if effect is to be given to them theywill require detailed examination by the Law Officers, who will no doubt wishto consult the Judiciary.In these circumstances the Ministerial Committee came to the conclusionthat it would be impracticable for a clause dealing with the matter to be incor-porated in the Bill and they recommend accordingly.Free Postal Delivery at Local Elections12. The County Councils Association of England and Wales expressed theopinion to the Committee on Electoral Law Reform that the right of free postageat the expense of the local authority concerned should be granted to candidatesat local government elections on condition that a deposit of  5 was paid. TheCommittee point out, however, in their Report that it is clear from the replies ofother associations that a provision on these lines would not command the general assent of local authorities and, accordingly, they felt themselves unable to makeany recommendation for a change in the law in this respect.Although it may be argued that it is right in principle that the expense ofthe privilege of free postage of candidates in local elections should be borne bythe local authorities concerned, such a provision might involve the smallerauthorities, e.g., parish and rural district councils in relatively heavy expenditure;and moreover, no evidence has been adduced of any general desire for an amend-nient of the law.
232The Ministerial Committee felt that it would be impossible to reach a conclusion on a matter of such complexity in time to enable a clause to be includedin the forthcoming Bill and they recommend that no change should be made inthe existing law in the forthcoming Bill.Treatment of Ballot Papers13. The Committee on Electoral Law Reform draw attention in theirReport to the present unnecessary diversity of practice in matters of detail inEngland and Wales on the one hand and Scotland on the other.   Thus, votingEapers on which an oblique line has been drawn by the voter in the voting spaceave been pronounced valid in England, but the contrary has been held in Scotland.The Committee agree with the view of the Committee on Electoral law reform that the law should leave no room for such uncertainties and I proposeto deal with a number of the more important matters in the Bill.Voting by Peers who are not Members of the House of Lords14. The Cabinet at their meeting on 15th July (CM. (47) 61st Conclusions,Minute 3) invited me to consider what amendments of the law would be requiredto provide that peers who are not entitled to a seat in the House of Lords shouldbe given a parliamentary vote.15. So far as the holders of English, Great Britain or United Kingdompeerages are concerned, no question arises. If men, such peers are Membersof the House of Lords; if women and otherwise qualified, they can vote at an election of a Member to sit in the House of Commons for the constituency con-taining their registered address.16. So far as concerns the holders of Irish peerages who are not also peersof England, Great Britain or the United Kingdom and as such eligible to sit in the House of Lords, there are now no elections of representative peers, thoughthe survivors now eight in number of the Irish representative peers elected for life before 1920 retain their seats in the; House of Lords. It would thereforebe necessary, in order to meet tue point raised by the Cabinet, merely to provide that Irish peers who are not entitled to sit in the House of Lords, if they aremen and otherwise qualified for registration at an address in the United Kingdom,may in future be registered and may vote at an election for the constituencycontaining the address. If they are women they are already eligible to be registered and to vote.17. In the case of the holders of Scottish peerages who are not also peersof England, Great Britain or the United Kingdom and as such eligible to sit in the House of Lords, the position is more complex. If they are women, noquestion arises; they are already eligible to be registered and to vote. If theyare men, they, along with the holders of Scottish peerages who are also peersof England, Great Britain or the United Kingdom, elect at the time of eachGeneral Election by open vote sixteen of their number to sit as representativepeers in the House of Lords. If a vacancy occurs during the life of a Parlia-ment they fill it by a similar open election. The point raised at the cabinet would not, therefore, be met by registering and entitling to vote those Scottishpeers who are not&apos; for the time being Members of the House of Lords. Someof them may be returned to Parliament as representative peers at the nextelection; and some of the representative peers who are in Parliament when theregister is made up may be out of it at the next. General Election.18. In order, therefore, to enfranchise Scottish peers who will not them-selves be in a Parliament which is being elected, it would presumably be necessaryto register all holders of Scottish peerages who do not also hold other peeragesautomatically giving them a seat in the Lords; to require the Scottish peers&quot;toelect their sixteen representatives before the day of the Poll at a General Election;and to provide that a Scottish peer, though registered, shall not vote if he hasbeen elected to serve as a representative peer.19. The question arises whether this course is right in principle. Thepeers in question, though not themselves Members of the House of Lords, are represented there by the sixteen representative peers. That being so, it may be argued that there is no reason why they should have double representation inParliament by having also a representative in the Commons when the majorityof peers who are themselves Members of the House of Lords have no such secondrepresentative in Parliament.
20. Logically there appear to be three possible ways of dealing with thematter. The first is to do nothing for the Scottish peers on the ground that theyare already represented in Parliament by the sixteen representative peers. Thesecond is to let all peers vote at elections of Members of the House of commons on the ground that this is no more anomalous than allowing a man who is, or may be himself, a Member of the House of Commons to vote at an election ofa Member for another constituency. The third course would be to enable allScottish peers to sit in the House of Lords and to enfranchise the Irish peerswho have no representation there either direct or indirect. This would in factmerely add about sixteen members to the House of Lords.21. On balance the Ministerial Committee felt that it would be inexpedientin present circumstances to make any change in the existing law.Speakers&apos; Expenses22. The Speakers Conference (Resolution 4) recommended legalising thepayment of speakers&apos; expenses, such expenses being included in the candidate^return of expenses. The Committee on Electoral Law Reform considered thatauthorised expenses of speakers should be included under a separate headingin the election return (para. 24 of their Interim Report).There appears to be no settled practice at present. In some cases travelling expenses of speakers have been included under the &quot; miscellaneous &quot; heading inthe candidate &apos;s return, and the cost of hospitality under the heading of the candidate&apos;s personal expenses; in others the whole cost has been borne under thelatter heading. On balance, the Ministerial Committee felt that the recommen-dations of the Speaker&apos;s Conference and the Committee on Electoral Law Reformshould be accepted.Polling Facilities in Rural Areas23. In my memorandum to the Cabinet of 3rd July, 1947 (CP. (47) 193),I stated that the Ministerial Committee would report further on the questionof increasing polling facilities in rural areas.In the view of the Ministerial Committee the most satisfactory course Wouldbe to place on county councils in England and Wales and on the returning officer in Scotland a duty, before the first Register under the new Act is published, to review the division of rural areas into polling districts and (i) to make every parish in England and Wales amd every electoral divisionor ward in Scotland a separate polling district and appoint for it aseparate polling place, unless the county council are satisfied that thisis hot practicable or is not reasonably necessary for the convenience of electors in voting; and(ii) to divide parishes and electoral divisions or wards into two or morepolling districts wherever this is practicable and is reasonablynecessarj&apos; for the convenience of electors in voting.The county council or returning officer would be required to publish the resultsof the review locally and to report them to the Secretary of State. The right ofa minor authority or thirty electors to represent to the Secretary of State thatpolling facilities were inadequate would be retained and the Secretary of state would have power to intervene.Initial Reports of the Boundary Commissions24. The Initial Reports of the Boundary Commissions for England,Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have now been published. There appearsto be no ground for any modification of their recommendations and in the view ofthe Ministerial Committee they should be accepted without alteration, subjectto the comments made in the following paragraphs: - 1Single-member Boroughs with large electorates.25. The Boundary Commission for England draw attention in paragraph 15of their report to the cases of eight boroughs* with electorates of between&apos; 80,000and 88,000. They recommend that each of these boroughs should return only one member.It is clear that these eight boroughs must all be treated alike, and the Commis-sion&apos;s recommendation that they should not be divided seems right. To dividethem would involve the addition of eight to the total number of seats in England.* Battersea, Blackburn, Bast Ham, Gateshead, Hammersmith, Norwich, Paddington and Beading.
233The, Commission already propose that the number of English seats should be fivemore than the number indicated in the Act (484), and any further increase would leave little to spare for later reviews. Further, three of these boroughs are inLondon. In proposing a total of 40 seats for the County of London, the Commis-sion have treated the County favourably, and a further 3 seats for London couldnot weir be justified. Moreover, the division of the eight boroughs would havewidespread repercussions. If each of them was allowed two members for a littlemore than 80,000 electors, it would be difficult to resist demands from otherboroughs for representation on the same scale. Bradford, for which the Commis-sion recommend three constituencies with an average electorate of about 71,000is a case in point. If such demands were to be met, a further, increase in thenumber of seats would be necessary, and in addition the balance of the Comrnis-sion&apos;s recommendations would be largely upset. The Commission had the delicatetask of constructing a carefully balanced pattern of representation, and anyattempt to alter it would involve the risk that the whole structure mightdisintegrate.The Ministerial Committee recommend that the Boundary Commission^proposal that each of these eight boroughs should return only one member shouldbe accepted.The City of London Constituency26. The CommissionV recommendations do not cover the City of London,which was excluded by the Act from the scope of their review. In view of thedecision that the City should cease to be a separate constituency and should become part of a new constituency named after it, it is now necessary to decide what the contents of that new constituency should be.Excluding business premises voters, the electorate of the City is 4,585. Ithas a common boundary with five Metropolitan boroughs north of the river,namely, Westminster (electorate, excluding business premises voters, 73,931),Holborh (17,096), Finsbury (25,111) Shoreditch (31,119) and Stepney (62,790).Of these the Commission propose that Westminster should be combined withChelsea to return two members, Holborn with St. Pancras to return two members and Finsbury with Shoreditch to return one member. The simplest plan,therefore, involving, the least disturbance of the Commission^ proposals, wouldbe to combine the City with Finsbury and Shoreditch to form a. constituencyreturning one member with an electorate of 60,815, excluding business premisesvoters. The constituency thus formed would also be satisfactory as regards shape and area.The Ministerial Committee, therefore, recommend that this plan should beadopted and that the new constituency should be known as &quot; The City of london with Finsbury and Shoreditch.&quot; l:London County Council Elections27. The alteration of Parliamentary constituencies in London will affect the electoral divisions for the election of London County Councillors. Section 11 ofthe London Government Act, 1939, provides that each Parliamentary constituencyin the County shall be an electoral division returning two members to the LondonCounty Council, except that the City of London returns four members. Theproposed reduction in the number of London constituencies from 60 to 40 would thus have the result of reducing the number of London County Councillors^excluding the four City of London representatives) from 120 to 80. The LondonCounty Council have pointed out that such a reduction would seriously prejudice the work of the Council, and they accordingly propose that Section 11 of the Act of1939 should be amended to provide that each of the new constituencies shouldelect three Councillors.The Ministerial Committee recommend the adoption of this proposal, totake effect for the L.C.C. elections in 1949. It would, of course, apply equally to the new constituency which will include the City of London..   ,U -: - .s -v.. . .   -     .      J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1,12th December, 1947.
