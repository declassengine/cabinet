Ministre,In reply to your note of the 17th November on thequestion of preparations for the peace settlement with. JapanI have the honour,  on instructions from the Soviet Government,to state the following.As is known, the Four Powers - China, the UnitedStates of America,  the Soviet Union and Great Britain, whobore7the brunt of the war and ensured victory over Japanwith their armed forces,  reached definite agreements between themselves, while the war was still on,  on the questions of .the post-war peace settlement.      This was reflected in the cairo declaration,  the decisions of the Yalta Conference and5in the Potsdam Declaration.    &apos; Moreover, by a decision of the potsdam Conference, the conduct of the necessary preparatory work for the peace^ settlement was entrusted to.the Council.of Foreign Ministers,  the participation of China in whichhod in view precisely the questions of a peace settlement in the Far -East.Atter the end of the war with Japan, the UnitedStates, Great Britain and the Soviet Union,  and also China,who had been associated with them, laid it down in theagreement reached in December 19h7 in Moscow that preciselythese four countries should participate in the Allied Council-1-
for Japan,  and that the Far Eastern Commission in washington should take its decisions subject to the requirement ofthe agreement of the representatives of the four above-,mentioned Powers, the special interest of these States in questions of the post-war position of Japan being thusconfirmed.Basing themselves on these decisions, the SovietGovernment in its notes of the 22nd July and the 29th August,^191+7s  stated that it was necessary to consider in theimmediate future, the question of the peace settlement for japan in the. Council of Foreign Ministers consisting ofrepresentatives of Chine., the U.S.A. , the U.S.S.R.  and GreatBritain.The proposal set out in your note regarding theprocedure for the peace settlement for Japan also basesitself on the recognition of the special interests of the. four above-mentioned Powers,  insofar as it provider- for     :.the.taking of all decisions on questions concerning the peace settlement&quot;for Japan subject to the requirement that therepresentatives of China,  the U.S.A., the U.S.S.R.  andGreat Britain shall give their consent,  although your notecontains a proposal for the convocation to this end of aspecial preliminary conference, which,  however, was not provided for by any previous decisions of the above-mentionedPowers and which is in contradiction with the Potsdam decision regarding the establishment of the Council- of foreign ministers and con only delay the establishment of peace inthe Far East.Therefore,  in the interests of the earliest-possible establishment of peace in the For East and thegrant to Japan and its people-ple of appropriate conditions forpeaceful development,  the Soviet Government proposes theconvocation in January,  19U8? of a special session of theCoun&quot;cil of Foreign Ministers consisting.. of representativesof China, the U.-S., the U.S.S.R.  and Great Britain to.consider the question of preparing the peace settlement for japan.It is proposed that the above-mentioned sessionof the Council of Foreign Ministers should be held in China,if the&quot;Chinese Government consider that desirable.. I should be grateful to you for an early reply from the Chinese Government on this question in.order thatpreparatory measures, may be taken as soon as possible ifthe Chinese Government and the two other interested governments &quot;agree to the proposal set out above.I have sent a similar proposal to the Governmentsof the United States of America and Great Britain.,1 beg you, Monsieur le Ministre,  to accept the assurance of my highest esteem.-(Signed) V.
