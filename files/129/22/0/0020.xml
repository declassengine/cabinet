JHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (47)  510 COPY NO.17TH NOVEMBER. 1947CABINETCRIMINAL JUSTICE BILL:    CAPITAL punishment memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State forScotlandOn an issue so important as that of the death penalty I feel that the House is entitled to expect a leadfrom, the Government;   we fail in our duty unless.we givetbe view of those responsible for maintaining law and security for the citizens.    I have reluctantly come to theconclusion that tho lead should be in favour of retaining the death penalty for the/present.   But I feel that thepolicy practised in the Scottish Courts of accepting adoctrine of diminished or impaired responsibility should be encouraged in order that murders which are clearly partly byaccident,  impulse or temporary madness or passion should botreated differently from those crimes which constitute a deliberate war against society.   This would in effect abolishcapital punishment in most cases though it would remain in reserve in case of need and to prevent fear arising from itscomplete abolition.2. I append to this paper a table showing for theyears from 1920-1946 the number of persons convicted inScotland .on indictment of crimes against the person and against property involving violence.    The numbers for .1945and 1946 are-higher than in any previous year of the period.The average number of persons convicted during each of the twenty-five years from 1920 to 1944 was kk-O&quot;,    the average for the years 1945 and 1946 was 738.    I fear that these numbers might increase still further and the task of thepolice and of the law-abiding citizen in dealing with crimesof violence might be made even more difficult and dangerousif,  at this particular point of time, the deterrent effectof the death penalty were withdrawn.   Police opinion inScotland would, I have reason to believe,  endorse the viewthat &quot;the armed criminal would be much more likely to use alethal-weapon to achieve his end or to escape capture if he knew that in the event of his conviction the worst that could happen would be a rather longer sentence of imprisonmentthan would otherwise have been imposed.   In this connectionI I am informed that in Glasgow the use&apos;of lethal weapons isI particularly, prevalent among boys under eighteen upon whom the death sentence cannot be imposed.    It has also beensuggested to me that if as a result of withdrawing the death penalty the use by criminals of lethal weapons should increasethe question of arming the police would be bound to arise.-1-
3*&apos; I am bound to admit, however, that while I holdthis view, it may be argued against me that Scottishexperience during the years 1929-1944 does not support theconclusion that in the absence of the deterrent effect ofthe death sentence, the number of violent crimes would increase.   During these fifteen years only eight death sentenceswere imposed in Scotland;    only six survived the Court of criminal Appeal;    and none was carried out.   This situation was partly tho result of the acceptance by the Courts inScotland of a doctrine of diminished or impaired responsibility which, if established, reduced the crime from murder toculpable homicide.   The view was widely held in Scotlandduring these years that, by the attitude of the Courts, andthe practice of exercising the prerogative, the death penaltyhad been virtually abolished.   But crimes of violence didnot increase.    On the contrary,  the annual average for thefifteen years in question.was 43.1 compared with an annual average of 1+58 for the nine preceding years.    It must,however, be remembered that the death penalty, though nevercarried out, was always in the background, and I believe thatthe position would be very different if it were to,be definitely abolished.. There is also the danger that, if violent crimedeveloped (such as gang interference v/ith courting couplesor attacks on children),  citizens might take&apos;the law into their own hands, should the law not appear to provide adequate punishment.A.W.Scottish Office, S.W.I.17th November, 1947.
