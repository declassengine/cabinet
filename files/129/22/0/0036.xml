It is issued for the personal use top SECRET \     Copy No.CP. (47) 32610th December, 1947CABINETPOSSIBILITY OF A THREE-POWER TREATY ON GERMANDISARMAMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at the present Conference of Foreign Ministers it is becoming clear thatthe fundamental differences between the Powers occupying Germany persist andare unlikely to be resolved. We must therefore consider the situation whichwill arise in the event of a breakdown.2. It is probable that a failure of the Conference will result in negotiations between ourselves, the United States and France for the fusion of the three western Zones, and in the carrying out of other measures necessary for theorganisation of Western Germany. The French have already told us that theyfear that such action will lead to a serious deterioration in the relations of theWestern Allies with the Soviet Union. Before exposing themselves to the risks which this situation would entail they are therefore anxious to know on whatmilitary support they could count, not, in the first place at any rate, againstGermany, but in the case of a clash involving Western Europe.3. This is a consequence of a breakdown of the present Conference whichmust clearly be faced. We are economic partners in Germany with the UnitedStates, and if four-Power agreement is impossible we must in any case, in co-operation with them, take various measures for the organisation of the CombinedZone from which in the hope of such agreement we have previously held back.In my opinion it is therefore most important that in deciding how to deal withthe situation envisaged by the French we should act in close consultation withthe United States.4. I consider that the wisest solution of the problem is to explore thepossibilities of applying the United States draft treaty for the disarmament anddemilitarisation of Germany, which was originally proposed by Mr. Byrnes, tothe Western Zones in Germany. This would have the advantage nOt only ofanswering the French fears of the Soviet Union, but also both of committing the Americans to Europe and of ensuring that, in Western Germany at least,the Germans would be kept disarmed. Furthermore, by using the present draftfour-Power treaty as a basis, and by drafting it in such a form that it wouldbe open at any time for the Soviet Union to adhere, we should avoid theappearance of a three-Power treaty directed solely against the Russians, whichwould have a very bad effect on public opinion and would dangerously exacerbatea relationship already seriously strained.5. I therefore request the agreement of the Cabinet that I should take actionon.these linesj consulting with the United States before formally suggesting thepossibility of a three-Power treaty to France. I am asking for this authoritynow, as the drafting of such a. treaty is by no means easy. Since there willbe need to act quickly, if the present session of the Council of Foreign Ministersbreaks up, prior approval by my colleagues will enable me to complete the necessarydrafting more quickly.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W.1,10th December, 1947.14466   34658
