7Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1947250CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.    31CP. (47) 33920th December, 1947CABINETNATIONAL WAR MEMORIALMemorandum by the Prime minister the Government have so far taken the line that there is little sign of public feeling on the subject of a National War Memorial; that no scheme has beenput forward which commands a general measure of acceptance, and that, inthese circumstances, any attempt by the Government to push the matter forwardwould probably fail to secure the widespread support which is essential in amatter of this kind.2. Last October, at the request of their President, Lord Chatfield, I receiveda deputation from the War Memorials Advisory Council. The deputation didnot put forward any specific proposals as to the form that a National war memorial might take, but Lord Chatfield urged that a site for a National war memorial should be earmarked and that an influential committee should be set&quot;p, with Government support, to collect subscriptions and decide what form the memorial should take. 1 promised to give Lord Chatfield a reply in writingafter I had had an opportunity of discussing the matter with my colleagues.3. Since then the Minister of Town and Country Planning has had a discussion with the President and the Secretary of the War Memorials AdvisoryCouncil, at which the suggestion was made that a committee should be appointedto consider whether and in what way the spirit of the people in war and the sacrifice of those who gave their lives should be commemorated.4. It is not clear that the procedure proposed by Lord Chatfield would leadto the devising of a scheme which wTOuld capture the imagination of the country;and in any event it is doubtful whether a committee should be given the task of deciding whether a Memorial ought to be erected, as this is a matter on whichthe Government should be quite competent to form an opinion. I am thereforeinclined to think that we should not at the present stage agree either to theproposal made to me when I received the deputation or with the more limitedproposal made to the Minister of Town and Country Planning. I should, however,be glad to have the views of my colleagues.(Initialled) C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,20th December, 1947.34701
