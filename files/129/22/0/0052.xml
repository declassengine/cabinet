THE PREPARATORY ASIAN REGIONAL CONFERENCE OF THEINTERNATIONAL LABOUR organisation memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the Preparatory Asian Regional Conference of the International Labour-Organisation met in New Delhi, India, from 27th October to 8th November, 1947,inclusive.   The delegates from the United Kingdom were as follows : Government delegates Sir Guildhaume Myrddin-Evans, K.C.M.G., C.B., Deputy Secretary,Ministry of Labour and National Service; Chairman of theGoverning Body of the International Labour Office.Mr. J. S. Nicholson, C.B., C.B.E., Former Principal Assistant Secretary,Ministry of National Insurance.Employers&apos; delegate Mr. Robert Gavin, Secretary of the West India Committee, Member ofthe Executive Committee of the Colonial Employers&apos; Federation.Workers&apos; delegate Mr. Alfred Roberts, O.B.E., J.P., Secretary of the AmalgamatedAssociation of Card, Blowing and&apos;King Jioom Operatives; Memberof the General Council of the Trades Union Congress.2. Invitations to the Conference were issued by the Governing Body of theInternational Labour Office to the metropolitan territories with interests in thearea. There was also provision whereby, with the concurrence of the metropolitanterritory concerned, non-metropolitan territories might be represented at theConference by tripartite delegations. Under those arrangements Burma, Ceylon,Singapore and Malaya were represented separately at the Conference. Advisersrepresenting the Hong Kong Government and Hong Kong Employers were included in the United Kingdom Delegation. A full list of the territoriesrepresented at the Conference is given in Appendix A.3. The Conference, being the first Asian Conference of the Organisation tobe held, attracted considerable attention. The opening session was attended bythe Prime Minister, Pandit Nehru, and other Ministers of the Indian Governmentand was addressed by Pandit Nehru in a speech which is reproduced as appendix B to this memorandum. Mention should also be made of the very warmand widespread hospitality offered to members of the Conference. His excellency the Governor-General and the Countess Mountbatten of Burma received allthe members and the staff of the Conference at Government House and entertainedrepresentative delegates to the Conference to dinner to meet members of theIndian Cabinet. The United Kingdom High Commissioner and Lady Shone alsoshowed very generous hospitality to the Conference, and the Prime Minister gave a reception. This hospitality was much, appreciated as was also the continuedinterest of the Governor-General and Lady Mountbatten shown by their attendance at many of the other functions connected with the Conference.4.   The Conference was generally regarded as having been a great successfor a number of reasons. In the first place it adopted a body of resolutions which,34722 bfPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1947CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   3CP. (47) 34229*/i December, 1947CABINET
with some obvious weaknesses and extravagances, broadly represent a sound,practical and progressive programme of action for Asian countries over the nextfew years in the field of labour legislation and social advancement generally.Naturally the progress actually achieved will depend upon the willingness and ability of the individual countries to implement the resolutions which theysupported by their votes, but the foundation has been laid and the way pointed out.Secondly, the Conference aroused great enthusiasm in Asian countries and will undoubtedly have stimulated greatly the interest of those countries in the workof the Organisation. Again the Conference brought together men and women of different interests and different types not merely representatives of Govern-ments from many countries not confined to Asia, who were enabled to exchangeviews and to get to knoAv each other, always a desirable end in itself. One ofthe striking features of the Conference was the marked goodwill and spiritof co-operation which was displayed in all discussions. Although there weredifferences of opinion as to details, in the end all resolutions were passedunanimously. Finally, from a narrower but still important aspect the conference was a success in that it was of great value to India by showing that she was able to stage an important conference of this size so soon after taking up herindependent existence and despite her present heavy and serious preoccupations.5. Some of the questions raised at the Conference opened up political issues of great difficulty and importance which, if not handled wisely, might have led tobitter and acrimonious debate. Thus Pandit Nehru, in his opening speech, referredto the necessity for securing the free and independent representation of all Asianterritories and in particular expressed regret that Indonesia and Viet Nam werenot represented separately but only through the Netherlands and French delega-tions respectively. A similar line was followed in regard to Indonesia by otherspeakers, so that it was thought desirable to ask the Credentials Sub-Committeeof the Selection Committee to report on the matter. The constitutional position was quite clear, namely that, as the Organisation does not have direct relationswith territories whose independence is not generally recognised, the conference had no competence in the matter; but it was equally clear that it was not goingto be easy to get this across to a conference most of whose members were firedto the highest enthusiasm by the slogan &apos;&quot;&apos; Quit Asia.&apos;&apos; The very competentSub-Committee was materially assisted in its difficult task by the frank andsensible attitude of the Netherlands Government representative, who, instead of taking a stand, as he might have done, on the legalistic point that this matter was not within the competence of the Conference, was able to show that, withinthe limits set by the existing political situation, the Netherlands Government had done everything possible to provide adequate representation for Indonesia andhad been very successful in their efforts. As a consequence the Sub-Committeewas able to present a report containing the information given by the netherlands government representative, which enabled the Conference to swallow not withoutdiscussion but at least without acrimonious debate or division the constitutionaldoctrine set out above.6. Another question of difficulty arose in connection with a very longresolution submitted by the Chinese Government on economic development. Itwas impossible to quarrel with the general substance of this involved resolution,but it contained much that was highly controversial and much, indeed, that liesonly partly within the field of the International Labour Organisation and mainlywithin the field of other organisations, including the United Nations, the Inter-national Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The difficulty was got overby the introduction of words to make it clear that the resolution should be regardedas a provisional draft only, which will now be submitted to Governments for their observations.7. Other questions of importance are referred to in the following paragraphs.8.   The subjects on the Agenda of the Conference were as follows : (1) Problems of Social Security.(2) Labour Policy in general, including the enforcement of labour measures.(3) Programme of action for the enforcement of social standards embodied in Conventions and Recommendations not yet ratified or accepted.(4) The general background of social policy, including problems of indus-trialisation.In addition, the Conference, had before it the Report of the Director-General.
9. It was the original intention, as the title indicates, that the work of theConference should be to -prepare the ground for the first full Regional Conference,to be held subsequently in Chin a, * by focussing attention on certain subjects of primary and immediate importance which could form the agenda for that conference. The large number of draft resolutions which was submitted, however,resulted in a far more detailed consideration of certain subjects than had originally been the intention. It is the case, nevertheless, that in the adoptionof certain resolutions the Conference fully achieved its primary purpose. ThoseResolutions embodied an ordered and comprehensive plan of investigation andstudy which, if accepted by the Governing Body, will enable the InternationalLabour Office to engage in the preparation of a series of Reports as a basis forconsideration at the full Regional Conference.10. A number of Resolutions were put forward not directly related to the items on the agenda, and some of these raised matters of great importance to thework of the Organisation.11. Mainly at the instance of the Indian Government favourable considera-tion was urged for a Resolution advocating the establishment within the Inter-national Labour Organisation of a regional organisation for Asia. This proposal is open to serious objection. In particular, it might well give rise to similar demands from other regions which, if granted, might result in a growth of particularismwithin the Organisation beyond what is desirable and healthy, and might evenprejudice the principle of universality which is fundamental to the work of theOrganisation. On the other hand, the Resolution attempted to give form to avery real feeling to which Pandit Nehru gave expression in his speech andwhich was generally shared at the Conference that the Organisation shoulddevote more time and attention to the problems of Asia than had hitherto beenthe case. In the form in which it&apos; was finally adopted, the Resolution on thissubject gave the Asian countries the substance of what they wanted withoutaccepting the principle of a permanent regional organisation. The Resolutionurged the Governing Body to convene sessions of the International LabourConference itself as well as meetings of the Governing Body, of the Joint maritime commission, and of other Committees in Asian countries; it further urged that consideration should be given to the establishment of a special Secretariat withinthe International Labour Office whose function it should be to co-ordinate allthe work being done on Asian questions.12. Allied to this question was that of securing greater participation ofAsian countries in the work of the Organisation. &apos; This took two main forms : (a) That the Asian countries which are members of the Organisation shouldbe helped, e.g.. by special financial measures, to send complete delega-tions to the Conferences and other meetings of the Organisation; and(b) That ways and means should be found for securing the direct participa-tion of more Asian countries in the activities of the Organisation.13. As regards (a), the difficulties are very great, and one result of increasingthe Budget of the Organisation to provide for the expenses of delegates attendingInternational Labour Conferences might well be to curtail the activities of theOrganisation by a corresponding reduction in the budgetary provision for actualOperational work. Such a curtailment would affect particularly those economicallybackward countries which stand to gain most by the activities of the Organisation.It was finally agreed that the best course would be to ask the Governing body to consider how the representation of all countries by full tripartite delegationscould best be facilitated.14. As regards (&amp;), this raised immediately the question of membership inthe Organisation of non-metropolitan territories in the region. With the singleexception of India, herself an original member, it has always been the practice in the Organisation for membership to be confined to States enjoying full and complete competence in the conduct of their external, relations and for the participation of non-metropolitan territories to be provided for through themetropolitan territory concerned. It was recognised that the participation ofAsian countries in the work of the Organisation was increasing. It was announced during the Conference that Pakistan had become a member of theOrganisation. Nepal was represented at the Conference by an Observer. Asregards the non-metropolitan territories, it was noted that Burma and Ceylon* It was decided to recommend to the Governing Body that this Conference should be heldin China in 1949. -34722 b 2
would soon be in a position to apply for independent membership of theOrganisation, and had expressed their intention of doing so. Singapore and malaya were represented by tripartite delegations. The position of certain other territories and, in particular, of Indonesia did, however, give rise to criticism.15. The. action taken in regard to the representation of Indonesia and theway it was disposed of have been described in paragraph 5 above. It must berecognised, however, that the independent representation of all Asian countriesin the work of the Organisation is a principle which will probably continue to be pressed strongly and constantly and not only at Asian regional conferences. Tofurther such claims appears to be part of I&apos;ndia&apos;s foreign policy. Moreover, thereis the practical point, of which India at any rate is not unaware, that the moreAsian countries who have a vote in the affairs of the Organisation, the greater the chance of securing for Asia a decisive voice in its work.16. That India would like to see such a powerful Asian bloc and herself asthe leader of it seems to be cleai. It was as a result of a determined struggle thatthe first Regional Conference (albeit a preparatory conference) was held in India.From the beginning the Indian Government made it clear that in addition to the presidency a post filled with distinction by the Hon. Jagjivan Ram, Ministerof Labour of India, who is only now recovering from a severe accident India&apos;simportance must be adequately recognised in the distribution of other posts ofresponsibility at the Conference. By the introduction, by members of a strong and numerous delegation, of a whole string of draft Resolutions, the Indians alsoshowed their determination that this Conference should achieve far more than might reasonably be expected of a preparatory Conference. The emphasis on the wider issues of I.L.O. policy in so far as they affected Asia also came from India.17. It would be putting it too strongly to suggest that there was at any timean open struggle for leadership between India and China, the other importantAsian country present. In the discussions behind the scenes for posts of respon-sibility at the Conference, China did, however, make it quite clear that she wasnot prepared to take second place and did not do so. There was also a tendencyon China&apos;s part to argue that certain important questions should be left open tothe China Conference. Here, however, the Chinese delegation were in some-thing of a dilemma. On the one hand, they did not want the New Delhi Con-ference to steal all the thunder. On the other hand, it was common knowledge that the Chinese would not be displeased with a suggestion that the full AsianConference should for certain practical reasons be postponed till 1949, and theycould not, therefore, urge the postponement of all important questions till that conference, while if the Conference seemed likely to make real progress, theChinese naturally wished to make their contribution and claim their share of anycredit. The line adopted by the Chinese delegation did, in fact, accord well withthe technical competence of the quite small Chinese delegation. Both in sug-suggesting and in discussing resolutions and in the general work of the conference the tendency of the delegation was to deal in a non-political and practical way with the questions arising.18. Of particular concern to the Chinese was the subject of Japan&apos;industrial future. A Chinese resolution on this subject, sponsored by the Chineseemployers&apos; delegate, but commonly believed to emanate from the Chinese Govern-ment, stressed the undoubted importance to Asia of a right solution being foundto the question of Japan&apos;s economic future; it urged appropriate limitations onthe industrial level to be reached by Japan and the observance of proper labour standards to safeguard the position of Asian workers generally; it further sug-gested that consideration should be given by the Governing Body at the right timeto the possibility of readmitting Japan to the Organisation. &quot;While the resolutionas finally adopted by the Conference did not go so far as the original draft in thedirection of making specific suggestions it does achieve the main object of theChinese- namely, to draw the attention of the appropriate authorities to this very important matter.19. Of the other territories represented at the Conference, Burma, Ceylon,Malaya and Singapore held their share of offices and quite properly were content to concentrate on the practical issues before the Conference. All were wellrepresented and their practical contributions to debate were given due weight.The United Kingdom Delegation itself refrained from taking a too active partin the public discussions, although a considerable amount of work was done in committee and behind the scenes. France and the Netherlands played very littlepart in the proceedings. Pakistan was very much overshadowed by the larger&apos;and more experienced Indian Delegation.
20. As is usual at International Labour Conferences the workers tended to act as a group. There was the usual tendency to press for resolutions going beyond what was realisable in the near future, but the United Kingdom workersled by Mr. Roberts were a sobering influence. It was also useful that several other workers&apos; representatives had had previous, experience., of ^InternationalLabour Conferences.21. The employers were not so united as the workers. The Indian employers in particular were inclined to press the point of view that countries should berepresented at such Conferences by nationals of the territory concerned, a pro-posal which was obviously directed at the European employers present as repre-sentatives of Asian territories. The view did not command general support.The workers, for example, took the line that the employers they wished to seerepresented at the Conference were the effective employers andnot the representa-tiyes of some small minority chosen mainly on grounds. of , nationality.&quot; Therepresentative of the Indian employers also spoke against the prices charged byWestern industrialists for capital,goods and the alleged constant, increases inthe prices of such goods. He also complained at the difficulty of obtaining, delivery of British manufactures. The attitude adopted by the Indian employer on these and similar matters did not make for unity in the Employers&apos; Group.22. Bearing in mind the possible sources of difficulty and conflict it is significant that this, preliminary Conference passed, off without a single majorincident. Bearing in mind, too, the comparative inexperience in internationalprocedure of many members of delegations the actual progress made was quiteremarkable. Such progress and the refusal of delegates to be side-tracked intoless productive but perhaps more attractive political issues, augurs well for thefuture work of the Organisation in Asia. I,t was a great step forward for the delegations merely to meet and exchange their experiences in similar fields. Butthe Conference went further than that. It mapped. out a &quot;fiefdfdf action for theimmediate future, and, provided that there fcotttiiihies5sja1rieu-&apos;willfiiglie8s andeagerness to use the Organisation as a &quot;means of attaining social justice in Asia,the New Delhi Conference may well come to be regarded as a turning point in-the social history of the Far East.G.

APPENDIX BAddress by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, at theOpening Session of the Preparatory Asian Regional Conference of theInternational Labour Organisation, New Delhi, 27th October, 1947.Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru (Prime Minister of India) : Mr. Chairman andDelegates, I have great pleasure in welcoming you on behalf of the Governmentand the people of India. Some months ago there was held in this city of Delhianother Conference called the Asian Relations Conference. That was a historicoccasion when representatives from various countries of Asia gathered here forthe first time and considered all manner of problems, more specially economic,problems. I feel that this Conference is also one of historic significance. TheInternational Labour Office, which was started soon after the First World War,has managed to survive all manner of vicissitudes and even the recent tremendousWorld War. That, I think, is a tremendous achievement, and I should like topay my tribute to this great organisation which has already done so much goodto the world. The League of Nations, which was the parent body of the Inter-national Labour Office, has faded away under special circumstances; but theInternational Labour Organisation survived and it carried on, previous to and during the last great war, and is now I am glad to say-carrying on with even greater vigour. Even before this last war was over it adopted the famousDeclaration of Philadelphia in 1944, and as I read it I feel that if the worldwere governed by the principles laid down in that Declaration, there would hardly be any major problems in this world. So I should like to pay my tribute of appreciation and admiration for the work that this International LabourOrganisation has done.Somewhat inevitably, perhaps, &quot;the attention of this Organisation has been concentrated probably more than the facts of geography warranted on problemsother than Asian problems. I do not wish to minimise the work which is donein Asia; nevertheless, the perspective was largely if I may say so European.Again, political factors also came in, that is to say, a number of Asian countries were under colonial domination, and politics and economics are interlaced sothat one cannot separate them. One effect of this political domination in variousAsian countries was to turn the minds of men in those countries towards the achievement of political freedom. The economic issues were somewhat hiddenby this political struggle for freedom, although the economic issues of course can never be ignored and are apt to produce catastrophic consequences if you seek to ignore them. There was this difficulty in Asia, and. now when most of thecountries in Asia are politically free or, I hope, on the verge of freedom, theseeconomic questions are coming very much to the fore.We are meeting here in Delhi, and many of you may know that we are facedwith very grave problems in India, grave problems of many kinds, more especiallyeconomic problems. Our time is taken up by our own problems at the moment, but,nevertheless, we have welcomed your coming here in spite of our preoccupationsbecause we do think that the problems of the moment will pass. But the essentialproblem which we seek to tackle remains and has to be tackled; and whateverour other preoccupations might be, it will be fatal-for us or for those who have any responsibility in any other country to forget these major economic issues.We talk of world peace, and even now, as we meet here, the United nations general Assembly is meeting in New York to consider major matters of conflict between nations. JMevertheless the essential basis of world peace must be, as Ithink the Declaration of Philadelphia states, social security, liberty, social justicefor all in every country. I think one of the phrases in that Declaration is worthy of remembrance. &quot;Lasting peace,&quot; it is said, &quot; can only be based on social justice.&quot;Again : &quot; Poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere.&quot; Ifwe remember those two statements and work in accordance with them, I think we shall be nearer a solution of world problems than we were on the politicallevel. Again, that Declaration refers to the right of all human beings to materialwell-being and spiritual development, including freedom and dignity andeconomic security.I take it that we who nave met here are not only sympathetic, but are bound by these principles which are laid down by the Declaration of Philadelphia. Ihave no doubt that if this Declaration were applied in its fulness to asian countries, world peace would be achieved fairly rapidly. It is not because I myself am a resident of India and Asia that I want to attach greater importanceto these vast regions though perhaps that might affect my vision.  But&apos; it is true
7269that the problems in Asia have been neglected in the past. It is true that whether it is the impact of history or whether it is considered an economicquestion they are due to the contacts of Europe and America. Other reasons are on the borderline, which come into the picture in so far as they effect europe and America. I need hardly say that no Asian will accept that perspective or thatapproach to this question. Indeed, no citizen of the world can do so if he wants to understand rightly what is happening and to find out a solution for what is happening. It is not a question again of rich and powerful countries beinggenerous, though generosity is always good. It is a question of viewing thewhole context of things in their proper perspective. As the Declaration ofPhiladelphia stated, &quot; Poverty anywhere is a danger to prosperity everywhere,&quot;just as some infectious disease somewhere may be a danger to healthy conditionselsewhere. Even rich and powerful countries may be drawn into some kind ofeconomic world vortex because conditions in Asia and the standards of living in asia are very bad and very low. Therefore it becomes important that there shouldbe a raising of these standards of living in Asia, in other words, that the commonman should go up in the scale of things, and that we should consider all ourproblems in terms of that common aim in Asia.I suppose there are hardly any regions in the world which are more closelyand heavily populated than India, China and Indonesia, not only because of theirvast numbers but also because of various other reasons. The wellbeing of thoseregions and the wellbeing of the people there, and&apos; the raising of their standardsare exceedingly important. How do we view those questions? In the past thewhole mass of these regions were colonial territories. Their representatives in a sense were representatives of the dominating metropolitan Powers and not oftheir country. Gradually this has changed. It has not changed sufficiently yet.Even now parts of Asia are not properly represented in this Conference because etheir metropolitan Powers do not choose that they should be properly represented.I am sorry for that, because it rather lessens the effect of this Conference; itcreates a certain ill-will and ill-feeling, and the influence that this conference should have on the peoples of those countries is not felt there because the method and work is not conducive to it. I hope the time will come soon when every formof colonialism will disappear from Asia, and I hope that this Conference-whichis very representative as it is will be even more representative of the peoples ofAsia than it is to-day.I am glad to welcome here I believe they have come for the first time tosuch a Conference people from Burma, Malaya, Ceylon, and certain parts ofIndo-China, and I understand that representatives of the Philippines will becoming soon. I regret that some nations are not represented here some countries of Asia, like Japan, Korea, the Indonesian Republic, and parts of Indo-China.The Viet-Nam parts of Indo-China. I appreciate the difficulties of this Organisa-tion, which is an intergovernmental organisation. I cannot by-pass governments in approaching peoples direct, though in its original Charter an attempt wasmade to get the co-operation not only of Governments but of workers and employers, which was perfectly right. I hope that this difficulty will be got overand these countries will in future find proper representation, because, if I mayrepeat, if any large part of Asia is sick, that sickness will spread. It is not good enough for political difficulties to be pointed out when a patient is dyingor is likely to infect others. We cannot ignore vast areas of territory because some dominating Power, or metropolitan Power, considers itself the representa-tive of those people and is not prepared to give proper representation to others.Now in India, referring to my own country, we are faced with many graveproblems1-economic in the main. You may read the newspapers and find out some of our present troubles, which have been serious and which continue toburden our mind even now. But may I tell you that, serious as those troublesare in our mind, the most important question in India is, nevertheless, an economicone and if we do not solve it, or better it, our troubles will increase. Essentiallythat is a problem of poverty, of unemployment, of semi-starvation for largenumbers of people of low standards of living of vast numbers. The^ InternationalLabour Office in the past has dealt with industrial questions, the living conditionsof industrial workers, and also to some extent of agricultural conditions and agricultural workers. Nevertheless, if I may say so, it has paid somewhat more attention to industrial labour than to agricultural labour. I do not wish you to pay any less attention to industrial labour, because that is very important, andeven in India it is a very important vital element in the community. NeverthelessIndia, and most countries in Asia are still, and are likely to continue to be,predominantly agricultural countries.  Therefore in India, any approach to these
problems must primarily take into consideration agricultural conditions theirimprovement. We have to-day a major problem-the food problem-which depends on the development of agriculture according to modern methods. Wehave been impeded in the past, owing to many reasons, political and others. Oneof these major reasons has been the land tenure system in this country. We cannot make real progress under semi-feudal land tenure systems. We as a Governmentare committed to remove the whole of the old land tenure system. We are committed to the abolition of the zamindari system or big landlord system, afterpaying adequate compensation. I am sorry that there has been delay in this because of other reasons, but we do wish to proceed in this matter as rapidly as possible because we think that that is the basis and foundation of every formof progress that we envisage. So also, I think, in other countries of Asiaagricultural and land tenure problems will have to be tackled rapidly so as toestablish a basis on which they can build up progress and better and betterliving conditions. I hope that this Conference will pay particular attention tothose agricultural and land problems.As a matter of fact, we have arrived at a stage when we cannot isolateone problem from another. If we seek to improve agriculture, say in India,we have to think in terms of removing the excessive burden on the land. Oneof the principal reasons for the poverty of India has been the overburdening ofland, that is, the lack of other occupations for the people, so that they have to fall back on the land. It is a*long and dismal story, and how unlike that ofother countries. During the last 150 years or so the rural population of india has grown at the expense of the urban population. In most countries in theworld urban populations have grown. In India, leaving out the last ten years or so, the rural population has grown and is becoming a progressively greaterburden on the land in the absence of other occupations. Obviously this canonly be remedied, and should be remedied, by transfer to other occupations of alarge proportion of the agricultural population of India.So even from the point of view of land we want the development of industry big industries, small industries, cottage industries, in fact, every kind ofindustry. Also, of course, from other important points of view the growth ofthe wealth of this country and greater production we want the growth ofindustry. If, therefore, we consider the agricultural aspect, immediately we arethrown back to a consideration of the industrial aspect of the question. you cannot separate them: they have to go together. Again, if we think of theindustrial aspect, we have to think of the development of the social services,sanitation, health, education, &amp;c. We have to think of transport. We haveto think of so many other things. In other words, the whole problem becomesJnter-related and we have to advance on a large number of frontssimultaneously. If you advance on one front, other problems confront uson the way and we have to stop there. Therefore it becomes necessary for ussomehow to plan all this in our minds and in our activities. Without that measureof planning, we cannot make progress all along the line. And when we arriveat a stage, as we have arrived to-day, of imminent crisis, not only in India but all over the world, people have to think rapidly and act quickly, otherwise eventswill overwhelm us.&apos;It is from this point of view that I hope that this Conference will considermatters in some kinds of perspective-the world perspective, the Asian perspective and think in terms not merely of improving the standards of living in this or that country, but that the standards should go up everywhere. The United states is a great, rich and powerful nation, in fact the greatest to-day. I have no doubt at all that the problem of the United States would be tremendously affected ifcountries in Asia deteriorated their standards to a level which would spell disasterin those countries: even the United States wealth and strength will not saveit from the effect of events that happen in Asia. Much more so is this truefor other countries in Europe or elsewhere. So it has become a world problem which cannot be isolated.Again, it is not a question of a country being philanthropic or humanitarianor offering help to this or that country. It is in their own interest to see thatthe standards go up, that disease the worst possible disease of poverty doesnot spread. *In this country we shall try to abide by the decisions of the InternationalLabour Conference to the utmost of our ability. In the past we have tried to doso. I cannot say offhand how far we have completely done so. There has been onedifficulty in our way. In the past the Government of India might have agreed tothese Conventions and Recommendations of the International Labour Organisation,
but parts of India, called the Indian States, were not wholly amenable to our influence. Labour laws like Factory laws,.&amp;c, did not keep pace with labourlaws in the rest of India. That was not only bad for the people in those States,but it was bad for the rest of India, because conditions there affected our people and they tended to keep down standards here in the rest of India. I hope thatall this will be changed in the future : there should be a certain uniformityabout it.It is said, rightly, that many countries in Europe, large numbers of people in Europe, are on the brink of starvation as a result of the last war and what has happened subsequently. That is so. But may I remind you that that stateof affairs has been chronically present here without the war. It is not war alonethat brings about blood, sweat and tears, but the economic conditions which arethe bane in Asian&quot; countries have continually left a trail of blood, sweat and tearsbehind; and the condition of the common man, the peasant and the worker is not good.  That is putting it very mildly.We complain of labour unrest, and labour troubles, and as a member of theGovernment I have felt annoyed and irritated often enough, because of labourtroubles at a time when we want to concentrate on production. If production isessential for all the world, it is certainly so for India. And yet behind thoselabour troubles are not merely a set of agitators but certain conditions whichnecessarily lead to that state of mind which results in labour troubles. I do not wish to blame any particular group, because I do think that that blame can bevery well apportioned in India&quot; to various groups, including, if I may say so, theGovernment of India. Nevertheless, I would tell every representative of everygroup that this question can no longer be considered in an isolated way in orderto protect this or that vested interest. We are facing a serious crisis and unless we meet things half way we will not solve it.I would nave liked at this moment of crisis, when we want greatly acceleratedproduction, some kind of industrial truce not to stop progress, for that wouldbe quite fatal but rather that every trouble and strife should be decided in a judicial way by arbitration, consultation and adjudication. I am myself convincedthat many of these troubles would be decided that way to the advantage of all parties concerned. We have inflation, though not so bad as in some othercountries; nevertheless it is bad enough, with the result that the wages and salarieswe pay seem bigger than they were. Clearly, in terms of price they were notbad. Prices have gone up, wages have gone up, but the gap between the pricesgoing up and wages going up is not covered. And if a self-satisfied employerpoints out that he has doubled the wages, it is not a sufficient answer, becauseprices have gone up three times higher and more. So it must be considered notonly in a humanistic way but in a practical way, by trying to reach a general level.If that is realised, then the problems will solve themselves! If not, all the good-will in the world and pious expressions cannot get over the gap that there is the gap between the income of the person and minimum requirements, and thereis bound to be trouble. I hope, therefore, that the lead that this Conference willgive will bring about industrial peace, that is to say, will lay down conditions forthe progressive improvement of labour and. agricultural conditions which will themselves lead to industrial peace.
