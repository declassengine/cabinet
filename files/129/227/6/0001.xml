I  attach   a   text of

agreement of the Cabinet I

on     the   afternoon   of Monc

The  gravity  of   the  crimes  which   the ,^report  examines, the

quantity of evidence which the Inquiry has already obtained,

and   the   firmness   of   its   recommendation  a ^ legislation to

enable the prosecution of war crimes in this d un^ y are all

greater than might have been expected.    The Inqui^^^ncludes

that   there   is   evidence   to   substantiate   a prosec^

respect of  at  least  three of the cases they have ei

Prosecutions   and   the   former   Crown Agent   are  cautious Cf^^^

derable weight.



In  $^#ace of this strong and clear report it would be

difficttlfe^fcb decide to take no action. Other civilised

countrie have discovered the presence of alleged war



criminals w144rin their jurisdictions have taken the necessary

steps to allow action to be taken against them.



The Inquiry recommfeftdir\kegislation to enable the prosecution

in this country of waE^ai/uries committed during the Second

World War by persons whc^eu?eb&gt;now British citizens or residents

in this country.   The legi^^^on would effectively give the

British courts jurisdiction &lt;^^s^ctivities which were

contrary to the internationally^^r&amp;2d laws and customs of war

at the time they were committed.  &lt; f?t is device the Inquiry

There is scope for argument whether the new

ye formed a view on whether the legislation is desirable in^?J/



.iple:



The ^$6&lt; &amp;1   considered but rejected a number of other options,

of which/ &amp;^radition of the individuals to stand trial in the

Soviet Uni^nS^as the only one which appeared worthy of serious

consideration^ Despite the changes that have taken place in

the Soviet Union in the past few years, however, it remains

questionable wheth r?^the individuals concerned would receive

(or be seen in this-^j^^^try to receive) a fair trial in the

Soviet courts.   The I^jraflfcv questions the Tightness of sending

men to stand trial in tn^^Hriet Union at a time when

allegations of similar atrocrCues under Stalin are still

emerging.   Nor would extradit^^oe certain to avoid either

the need for legislation or thd^m^kibility of lengthy and

uncertain proceedings in the Brit^nVopurts.    For all these

reasons I continue to believe that M^^iould not extradite.

There appears, therefore, to be no prax?fcical alternative to

the Inquiry&apos;s recommendation, other than doing nothing.



The report does not minimise the difficulty of^oj^hting

prosecutions:    there could be no guarantee, eve

legislative effect were given to the proposals, thfcl

would be prosecutions, let alone convictions at the

day.   The report recommends a number of procedural chari

designed to meet some of the problems which would be

encountered in bringing these cases to   trial: in

^^sjticular, the application to war crimes of the facility

gzrakdy available in serious fraud cases to forego committal

proceedings (in order not to put elderly witnesses through

their&lt;^e#1dence twice);    and the implementation, and extension

to ScotlMK^and Northern Ireland, of the provision in the 1988

Criminal dtoetifce Act for taking evidence by live television

link from wrkrasses abroad.    The latter would enable witnesses

too infirm to travel to confront the accused in the presence

of the court, and J^^je cross-examined in front of the

accused.   This prov?id?oh, has not yet been implemented, on

resource grounds.   Cut^iivt-estimates are that general

implementation of the prwiuons would lead to prosecution

costs in England and Wales&lt;  / 2. 5m, plus costs to the Legal

Aid Fund of between  9m and  1   \&gt; Extension to Scotland and

Northern Ireland would extend t&amp;atf^igure further, again

assuming implementation of the prc^v^von applied to all

categories of case.   My provisional^ged is that it would not

be right to implement the provisions in respect of war



crimes - that would give the impression that special

circumstances were being created to enhance Ji e\\likelihood of



th&amp;t&apos;^iese cases

are on all fours with ordinary proceedings, but %z7a&amp;L1 be

important to do as much as possible&apos; in that regar

clear, however, that the cost implications are subst&lt;

public order-type policing activity.   The defence would be

serial could range widely into history.    Each trial

woul&gt;^#abably last for months.   The overall cost would depend

ciniciariy^ob how many cases came to trial:    in addition to the

three cas  3??Sftich the Inquiry recommended as suitable for

prosecution$^ fiey identified a further 124 where more

investigation was required.    If only a small proportion of

these came to trial^we could still be talking of costs in the

tens of millions. ^2&gt;/^



The Inquiry recommended,^fc^&gt;urgent steps be taken to follow

up these further cases, lo not propose acting on that



recommendation at any rate balp^l?^ the report has been debated

by Parliament.   How large an intewfe^gative effort would be

justified would depend on what we ^Jofreluded was a defensible

period of time in which to bring tha^^ercise to conclusion.

No provision has been made either for        costs of

investigations or later proceedings.



The attached statement expresses a preliminary/ztfl^w in favour

\essary precaution.



th^Sfecision is in favour of legislation, it would be hard

to fina ^H^grounds for delay beyond the 1989/90 session.



The legislat^^ provisions themselves would not be complex. I

would propose a short, free standing. Bill (of some half dozen

clauses) to create/ Hfc necessary offence and to effect the

various procedural^eju^n^ps which the Inquiry has recommended.



This will be a difficul^^^l^painful discussion.   Views on the

wisdom and fairness of act&lt; &lt;KWb this distance of time will

cross party lines.    Some of ou^Xo^n supporters have expressed

strong opposition to action, tho^ ^heir attitudes may be

modified by the terms of the Inqui,r^ port, once published.

Colleagues should be aware, too, of tfcKe^Iinistry of Defence

anxiety that directing attention to thf^e^cases may resurrect

calls for the prosecution of British servicemen alleged to

have committed similar offences during the S^tfO^i World War

although any such offences are already within

jurisdiction.   Despite these considerations, I

no option but to state our disposition to accept t

WAR CRIMES INQUIRY



h   permission,   Mr   Speaker,   I   should   like   to   make a



nt about the report of the War Crimes Inquiry.   I set



up th^Xtiteuiry in February 1988 to consider allegations that



persons w^^Sire now British citizens or resident in the

United Kingdom committed war crimes during the Second World



War;    and to ad^&amp;Lwhether the law of the United Kingd



om



should be amended i^t^tder to enable prosecutions for war

crimes to take place in U0ikcountry.

impressive documentY-^It is notable for the breadth of view



which  it  takes,   of historical  context  affecting the

The Inquiry deals with allegations of horrific killings on

The Inquire/reached their recommendation on legislation and



prosecution in this country after examining and rejecting

The   Inquiry&apos;s  recommendations   raise   impo^ 3t^t   issues of

pX^sgizNting  very  old  men   so   long   after   the   events. The



ract^^^Xdifficulties  of  conducting  trials  include the age

and frai^ii^of witnesses; the problems of assembling

evidence whixtfi is  available,   if  at  all,   in the Soviet Union

with all these matters.



On the other hand it will be argued tha &lt; in the words of the



report:



&quot;The crimes committed are so monstrous th

they cannot be condoned ....... To take no

being a haven for war criminals.&quot;

in this r^grrt.    Despite the practical



problems of conducting



a trial the &lt;aiperienced  Inquiry  team,   a former



Director of

view that



there would be suffi/tfSk evidence in three cases to mount a



prosecution if there we(fc^xisdiction.    If and when the t

of   the   day   will   need to

particular   cases.     Our   present  ^pfcf   is   that   we should



follow the Inquiry&apos;s advice and legi^^S on the broad lines

which it proposes.



This



is a matter,  however,   on which the views Parliament

roust   be   paramount.     Before   reaching   a   final vie^^



the

a proper opportunity to study the report and reflect upon it.



In the lighe&lt;?K5f the views expressed, the Government will take
