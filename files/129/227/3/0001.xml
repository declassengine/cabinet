Public expe^jl^re restraint has been a key instrument of our

economic strategy over the past ten years. One of our major

achievements h^^flken to reverse decisively the upward trend in

the share of natiefcaJAincome taken by public expenditure.    We have

The baseline



The plans we agreed last Autumn included very sharp increases

ome key programmes. These plans provide the starting point

Survey, which will be conducted using a new definition

&gt;planning total. The methods of setting the baselines for

those items affected by the change in definition were endorsed by

Cabinet in March. General government expenditure is unaffected by

the change to the planning total.



The bids ^^tfW



5. My minute oe_6 uly to the Prime Minister summarised the bids

received from DeM^%ments. In addition we must take account of

territorial block consequences, the nationalised industries, net

contributions to tfl^tK. and the Revenue Support Grant and non-

domestic rate elements a^Wfcggregate Exchequer Finance for local

authorities. Additions to expenditure financed by local

authorities from their own resources are outside the planning

total, on the new definition, but they will still increase general

government expenditure.



spending   that   would be

and unsustainable in the

rease in   the   share of

e the beginning of the

ersal of   our policy

raing,    and   would be



6. The bids imply a total incr

irresponsible in present circum

future. It would mean the first sha

public expenditure in national inco

decade. This would be seen as a comple

of restraining the growth in public

particularly damaging at a time when private spending is being

held back by the measures needed to reduce inflation. It would

mean that, for the foreseeable future, there would be no chance of

reducing the tax burden as a proportion of naticAS%income, still

less of getting back to the level we inherited ^51^%^ 3 3 a&lt;3 

This would be seen as another significant shift in

financial markets and more generally, on our commitment



fiscal   policies, and the defeat of inflation,

9. We shall also neecf i^^ook closely at the bids for additional

capital spending. The baselines already allow for some very large

increases in public sector investment, much of it on construction.

If we were to agree additions on the scale implied by the bids,

the public sector&apos;s demands 4aK%:he construction industry would

rise by some 25% between this yeSj^^id next. The Chancellor&apos;s

account of the capacity of the supplying industrj^g, as well as

the usual considerations of affordability.

^Community Charges at around this year&apos;s average   per   capita rate

if   they   budget   sensibly.     While respecting the need for

.ic expenditure restraint this year, this decision has added  1

to   the   public   expenditure planning total and therefore

1 pre-empts the room for adding to other expenditure in the

: of the Survey.



Running Costs



11. Running Aests bids exceed  800 million, with many colleagues

seeking to r&lt;%J^fl three year running cost agreements. If the

bids were agrevD^ full, spending on the Civil Service would rise

in 1990-91 by l^^^^nore over this year, with further significant

rises in the late

running costs to absorB^-ypL cost of pay settlements. Further

savings will be needed ir we are to support high priority policies

including &quot;spend to save&quot; initiatives such as relocation, at the

same time as providing realistically for future pay settlements.

I am not yet satisfied with the^^^t improvement proposals for

some areas of the Civil Se^K^L particularly where there are

large executive operations. ,^^X

14.    All    of    the    main    nationalised    industries put in very



large additional bids. In scrutinising their revi^fc^^s, which

are due later this month, we must make substantial ^2^e^.ons and

bring them to realistic levels, taking account of otheimneBor bids

which add to demand on the construction industry. wS(^large

projects are involved, we must be alive to the longer term
