BRITAIN AND  NATO  -  FORTY YEARS  OF SECURITY

NATO ? S ACHIEVEMENT



101. On 4 April,  NATO celebrated its fortieth anniversary in a world

very different from that of 1949.    Then,  in the troubled years

immediately after the Second World War,  it was clear that a collective

security system embracing Western Europe and North America was the

only way to preserve freedom and democracy in the face of overwhelming

Soviet military power  in Europe.    NATO has been more successful than

its founders could have dared hope in ! eeping the peace in Europe at a

time of instability and rapid change in many parts of the world. Now

there is a growing recognition in the Soviet Union that its actions

have created insecurity for others,  and it is beginning to change its

internal and external policies.    But the need to maintain a strong and

cohesive Alliance is undiminished.



102. Cooperation in peace with the East has been the Western aim

throughout the past forty years.    The hope that this would emerge from

the wartime alliance was soon dashed;  by the time of Churchill&apos;s

Fulton speech in March 1946 the Iron Curtain dividing Europe ?as

already in place.    But it took a  series of events between 1945 and

1948  to galvanise  the Western democracies  into founding NATO. These

events and the persistence of the Cold War in the 1950s-and 1960s bred

in the West a wariness of Soviet intentions that could not be quick-ty-

dispelled,   setting a pattern of Western reaction to Soviet actions

that is apparent even today.    As  the history of NATO&apos;s first forty

years makes clear,  the pace of progress  (or lack of it)  in East-West

relations has  inevitably been governed by the willingness (or

otherwise)  of  the Soviet Union to  join the West in peaceful



coope ration.



103.  NATO has consistently set the agenda for constructive measures to

improve East-West  relations;  its dual approach,   encompassing both

strength in defence and readiness for dialogue and cooperation with

the East,  was encapsulated in 1967 in the  report by the Belgian

Foreign Minister Pierre Harmel.    Even before the Harmel Report, NATO

was pressing for agreements to cut both nuclear and conventional

forces in Europe;  it has advocated a global ban on chemical weapons;



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



since 1979  it has unilaterally cut the number of its nuclear warheads

in Europe by 35%;  and its  steadfastness and unity brought success in

the INF talks.    That NATO still leads the way was once again shown

when the Warsaw Pact eventually published in January its version of

the balance of conventional forces - two months after NATO had done

so.



The New Challenge for NATO



104.. The challenge for NATO now is to !respond to the opportunities

created by its own success.    Under President Gorbachev Soviet foreign

policy has acquired new flexibility,  pragmatism and sensitivity to the

security concerns of others,  as shown by the withdrawal of Soviet

forces from Afghanistan.    His announcement,  at the United Nations in

December,  of his intention ho cut the number of Soviet conventional

forces in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was a welcome and

important step in the  right direction.    it has been followed by

statements by other Warsaw Fact leaders that they propose to reduce

their armed forces and defence spending.



105. We welcome the shift in attitudes that these developments

reflect.    We hope  that  the promised arms cuts presage a constructive

Soviet approach in the negotiations on Conventional Armed Forces in

Europe which began in Vienna in March (further details are given in

Chapter 2).    But we should be under no illusion about this new sense

of  realism;   it  is primarily designed to serve Soviet interests, not

those of the West.



106. It is a plain fact,  admitted by the Soviet Union,  that, even

after  the cuts promised by Warsaw Pact leaders,  major imbalances

between the forces of East and West will  remain;    Warsaw Pact hankc

and artillery in the area from the Atlantic to the Urals will

outnumber those of NATO by 2.4:1.    While such imbalances persist, the

Warsaw Pact will,  whatever its stated intentions,   retain its

capability for aggression.    And,  as described in Chapter 6,  the Soviet

Union has continued to modernise its forces; new nuclear missiles

(including short-range systems)  and strategic bombers are being

deployed and production of conventional weapons,  including the most

modern tanks and aircraft,  remains at a high level.

107. The Warsaw Pact can afford to promise unilateral cuts because it

has weapons to spare;  such cuts would not diminish its security. The

West&apos;s forces, by contrast, are kept at the lowest level we need for

our defence;  to reduce them now in response to promised Warsaw Pact

unilateral  reductions would merely lead to a continuing imbalance at a

lower level.    Our aim is to remove the imbalance by negotiated cuts

and thereby genuinely to enhance the security of Europe as a whole at

a lower level of conventional forces.    The Soviet Union appears, for

the first time,  to have accepted this principle.    But we cannot rely

for our security on the public pronouncements of the current Soviet

leadership, welcome as they are; we must be sure that changes in the

Soviet Union are fundamental and irreversible.    For as long as an

objective military threat remains,  we must,  as NATO leaders reaffirmed

in Brussels last year,  maintain the forces necessary for deterrence.



MAINTAINING DETERRENCE



108. NATO can only maintain peace and security through deterrence



Iresting on its members&apos;  collective commitment to resist aggression.

Deterrence needs a full  range of military options;  although strong

conventional forces are an important element, history shows that they

cannot by themselves prevent war.    Only nuclear weapons can do that;

we cannot achieve our aim of preventing all war,  conventional and

nuclear, without them.    As discussed in the essay on page [], NATO&apos;s

strategy of flexible response requires nuclear weapons at the

strategic and non-strategic levels.    For the foreseeable future, there

will still need to be nuclear systems based on land in Europe. And

all nuclear weapons must be kept up to date if they are to provide

effective deterrence.

109. The NATO commitment to resist aggression through common defence

is given practical substance in several ways.    First and foremost,

members make a firm commitment of forces to the Alliance.    Forces from

several members are also based in peacetime on the soil of others, and

there are plans for their rapid reinforcement in time of tension.

NATO has wide-ranging crisis management plans, and an extensive

programme of common funding for infrastructure for military forces.

It thus provides a unique framework for rapid and effective military

cooperation.

110.  The United States provides the largest single contribution to

NATO.    But the continued strength and cohesion of the Alliance also

require a major contribution from the European allies; neither North

America nor Europe alone could maintain the credibility of NATO&apos;s

defence posture.    Stimulated by concern in the United States,  NATO has

in the past year been discussing ways to share responsibilities within

the Alliance more equitably.    This issue is discussed on page [].



Box:  Sharing the Burden in NATO



1. The North American commitment to defend Europe is the foundation

of NATO&apos;s strength.    This commitment is manifest in the nuclear

contribution of the United States;  in its ground forces in the Federal

Republic of Germany;  in its naval forces in the Eastern Atlantic and

the Mediterranean;  in its air forces based on the territory of eight

European members of the Alliance; and in plans for reinforcing these

forces rapidly from the United States.    Canada also has forces in

Europe and would reinforce them in an emergency.    The United States&apos;

vigorous leadership has been crucial in maintaining Alliance cohesion

over the last forty years.    This reflects a consistent recognition by

successive US Administrations that the defence of Europe is vital to

the national interests of the United States.



2. But the health of the Alliance depends on the contributions made

by all of its members.    Their size and value varies from country to

country.    Recently,  growing concern in the United States that it might

be carrying too much of the burden led to the Alliance report

Enhancing Alliance Collective Security,  published in December. We

welcome this report, which analysed the many factors, both

quantifiable and unquantifiable,  that contribute to NATO&apos;s enduring

strength; taken together,  these factors give an indication of each

country&apos;s defence effort.    The report reflects the size of the US

contribution to NATO and to the wider defence of Western interests.



It also recognises the invaluable contribution made by the European

members of NATO, not least the substantial and comprehensive British

contribution.



3. The European allies collectively provide most of NATO&apos;s ready

forces in Europe and the Atlantic,  including 90% of the men,  80% of

the artillery and aircraft,  70% of the tanks,  and 65% of the major

warships.    Many also bear the social and economic cost of maintaining

conscript forces, which enables them to mobilise large numbers of

reserves in the event of conflict; most of NATO&apos;s forces in Europe

would still be European even after transatlantic reinforcements had

arrived.    The European allies also contribute to all NATO&apos;s standing

military and naval forces.



4. All the European members of NATO support the nuclear element of

its strategy of deterrence.    Both the United Kingdom and France have

independent strategic and theatre nuclear forces, while seven European

allies,  including the United Kingdom,  are host to US nuclear forces or

have systems that can deliver US nuclear warheads.    The European



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



allies are also host to the conventional forces of the North American

allies based in Europe in peacetime,  and would provide support for

their reinforcements.    Over 900 bases and other installations are

provided for US forces in Europe,  including 66 in the United Kingdom.

The cost of providing many facilities to support US forces has been

shared through the NATO Infrastructure programme, which is paid for

chiefly by the European allies.



5. Many European nations bear the heavy social cost of military

training on their territory.    Every year the Federal Republic and the

United Kingdom each have around 80,000 jet flights below 1,500 feet to

provide essential low-flying training.    Western Europe is highly

developed and densely populated;  it is very difficult to provide

realistic training without impinging on ordinary civilian life. We

are always looking for ways to cut this burden, but our forces cannot

be effective without practice in the areas where they might need to

fight.



6. European nations also help protect Western interests out of area.

In the Gulf, British warships have successfully patrolled

international waters for nine years.    The United Kingdom has forces

stationed in Cyprus,  the Indian Ocean,  the Far East,  Central America

and the South Atlantic.    France maintains forces in the Indian and

Pacific Oceans,  the Caribbean and Africa, while the Netherlands and

Spain also have a military presence out of area.    The United Kingdom

and France have large programmes of military assistance around the

world.    And Europe promotes global stability in other ways, for

instance by providing large amounts of economic aid to developing

countries.



7. This substantial and diverse European contribution was fully

acknowledged in NATO&apos;s December report.    But looking to the future,

the report identified areas where a number of allies need to make

improvements.    These include the level of resources committed to

defence, better responses to Alliance force goals, and more modern and

sustainable forces.    The report&apos;s conclusions underline clearly that

burdensharing is not primarily a transatlantic issue;  it is for all

members of the Alliance to ensure that the benefits, responsibilities

and risks of Alliance membership are shared fairly among them.



111.  The European organisations concerned with security cooperation

continue to make an important contribution to collective defence. The

United Kingdom currently holds the Presidency of the Western European

Union (WEU), which was strengthened last November by the accession of

Spain and Portugal.    During our Presidency our aims have been to build

on the Platform on European Security Interests, noted in last year&apos;s

Statement;  to encourage the WEU&apos;s role in forging a more coherent

European view on security and arms control issues in support of the

Alliance; to promote practical contributions to common defence; and to

develop the WEU&apos;s part in coordinating, where appropriate, matters

affecting common security outside the NATO area,  as in the Gulf (see

Page [ ] ) .

112. The Eurogroup has played a major part in the discussions on

sharing risks and responsibilities within the Alliance,  and its

working groups study practical ways for the European allies to improve

their contribution to NATO.    In the equipment field, we assumed the

Chairmanship of the the Independent European Programme Group this year

(see paragraph 408).



113. Bilateral cooperation is also important, and we have been

pursuing this actively.    Our relationship with the Federal Republic of

Germany,  among the closest in Europe,  is an especially important

foundation of European security cooperation.    We are seeking to widen

Anglo-German cooperation in several areas including training and

logistics.    We also continue to pursue opportunities for closer

cooperation with France,  for example through joint exercising and

through reciprocal purchasing (see paragraph 411).



BRITISH DEFENCE POLICY



114. The mutual commitments of NATO membership have been fundamental

to the defence of the United Kingdom for forty years and we place the

highest priority on providing effective forces for the Alliance. We

are committed to NATO&apos;s strategy of deterrence based on a mix of

nuclear and conventional forces,  and are the only European nation to

contribute to all three legs of the NATO triad of forces - strategic

nuclear,  theatre nuclear,  and conventional - that underpins flexible

response.    As described in paragraph 323,  the Trident programme, which

will maintain our independent strategic deterrent,  continues to make

good progress.



115. The air,  sea and land defence of this country is critically

important to NATO as a whole.    In war, we would be a forward base for

the Atlantic Command,  a rear base for Europe,  a main operating base

for the Channel,  and a major base for US reinforcements to the

European theatre.    No less important is our commitment to NATO&apos;s

strategy of forward defence.    This is demonstrated by our ground and

air forces based in the Central Region, by our naval and air forces 

committed to the forward defence of the seas northwards of Britain and

by our specialist reinforcement forces  (see page []).

116. [We also play an active part in encouraging dialogue with the

East,  in line with NATO&apos;s dual approach.    The successful visit by Mr

Gorbachev in April this year showed,  once again,  the value of frank

exchanges of views in establishing a better understanding and a firmer

basis for cooperation in relations between the United Kingdom and the

Soviet Union,  and between East and West.]



117. Our concern for preserving peace and stability is not confined to

Europe.    The United Kingdom has important defence commitments outside

the NATO area,  including direct responsibility for defending our

dependent territories.    Crises and conflicts elsewhere may also impair

the Alliance&apos;s security,  either directly or by affecting the global

balance.    British defence activities outside the NATO area, described

in paragraphs 308-312,  contribute at relatively little cost to the

Government&apos;s foreign policy aim of promoting stability in areas

important to our interests,  and to the wider interests of the West as

a whole.    The men and equipment deployed on these tasks could be

quickly returned to the NATO area if needed.



118. In each of the last two Public Expenditure Surveys large cash

increases have been made to previous allocations for defence. The

defence budget will  rise by about  1 billion in each of the years to

1991-92,  and on current inflation projections there will therefore be

real growth in the budget over these years.    This shows our continuing

determination to maintain strong and effective forces for our national

defence.    Moreover,  last year&apos;s Public Expenditure Survey has given us

a firm three-year framework within which the defence programme can be

planned with confidence; more details are given in Chapter 5.



119. NATO will be the keystone of the defence of the United Kingdom

and our Western allies in the future as it has been in the past. We

will keep up our large and highly-valued contribution to the Alliance.

Changing circumstances are setting NATO new challenges;  the Government

will play its part, as it and its predecessors have done,  in ensuring

that NATO tackles them far-sightedly and continues to build on its

unparalleled success over the last forty years.



Essay : Arms Control and War - The Soviet View



CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL



 .      The Soviet Union has always claimed that its military doctrine

(which we discussed in last year&apos;s Statement)  is defensive.    But a

basic tenet of traditional Soviet doctrine is that attack is the best

form of defence.    Since the Second World War,  the Soviet Union has

organised and equipped its forces for swift,  aggressive warfare using

surprise,  to ensure that an enemy is defeated before he can bring his

full military-economic potential to bear and that the fighting takes

place outside Soviet territory.    Although the Soviet Union claims that

its doctrine is defensive,  it has built up massive forces that are

larger than reasonably needed for genuinely defensive purposes, and

its willingness to use them (for example,  in Eastern Europe and

Afghanistan)  has been a fundamental source of instability in Europe.



2.      NATO has consistently sought to lower the level of armaments

through arms control.  But cutting armaments should not be an end in

itself; uncritical enthusiasm for arms cuts can in fact make conflict

more likely,  as in the 1930s.    NATO&apos;s prime aim in arms control is to

maintain the security of its members and,  if possible,  enhance it.

The Soviet Union has similar aims.    Its proposals for arms cuts are

not altruistic;  they aim to improve Soviet security.    We must ensure

that the Soviet Union does not improve its security by impairing ours.

To understand the Soviet approach to arms control, we must also

understand the development of Soviet thinking on the likelihood of war

in Europe since 1945.



33..     Between 1945 and the mid-1950s the Soviet Union believed that a

global war between &quot;capitalism&quot; and &quot;socialism&quot; was inevitable - the

decisive struggle between two irreconcilable systems.    Soviet planners

therefore expected a global war,  but concentrated on massive

conventional campaigns like those on the Eastern Front in the Second

World War.    Stalin refused to allow his planners realistically to

consider global nuclear warfare, which would anyway have been

academic,  as the Soviet Union could not strike targets in North

America with nuclear weapons until well into the 1950s.



4. In the mid-1950s,  Khrushchev concluded that the Soviet Union&apos;s

greater military strength now deterred a Western attack,  and that war,

though still a real and constant danger, was no longer inevitable;

under his doctrine of peaceful coexistence the Soviet Union would seek

to live in &quot;peace&quot; with the West until the inevitable collapse of

capitalism and the triumph of communism.    But Soviet planners argued

that,  if there were a war,  an intensive nuclear exchange would ensue

very quickly,  inflicting great damage on both sides.    If war seemed

inescapable,  the Soviet Union planned to launch a pre-emptive nuclear

strike to minimise the damage that the West could do to the Soviet

Union.    Nuclear forces were therefore given primacy and conventional

forces cut.



5. By the mid-1960s,  Soviet planners,  perhaps influenced by the NATO

policy of flexible response,  concluded that war would not necessarily

begin with an immediate and unrestricted nuclear exchange;  there might

first be a conventional phase,  possibly prolonged.      Soviet planning

now conceived of possibly winning a war in Europe without needing to

use nuclear weapons.    In a swift,  intense conventional campaign, the

Soviet Union might be able to defeat NATO in Europe before the

Alliance could mobilise its greater economic strength. More

important,  NATO&apos;s use of theatre nuclear weapons might also be

pre-empted,  making escalation less likely.    NATO would find it

difficult to use nuclear weapons for several reasons:  units of both

sides would be mingled;  it would be hard to target rapidly moving

forces; NATO command and control systems might be disrupted by Warsaw

Pact strikes;  and NATO would take time to agree to use nuclear



ieapons.

This new approach led to a restructuring of Soviet forces,

onventional forces were enlarged and their equipment improved in the

uild-up that began in the 1970s.    The deployment of strategic nuclear

missiles was judged to have given the Soviet Union nuclear parity with

the United States and attention could be given to other forces. Any

reduction in missiles was best achieved by negotiation (which would

also cut the number of US missiles) and the Soviet Union agreed,

therefore,  to take part in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.

Although it claimed to have renounced the first use of nuclear

weapons, which could only widen the scope of any conflict and threaten

the nuclear devastation of the Soviet Union,  it remained ready to use

them;  their retention would deter their use by NATO but also allow the

Soviet Union to override the  &quot;no first use&quot; declaration if necessary.



7. It was clear to Mr Gorbachev that Soviet interests had not been

best served by the policies of his predecessors. The military build-up

that began in the Brezhnev era  (and continued after Mr Gorbachev came

to power) made international tension worse,  and made the West more

determined to have proper defences against Soviet forces. And it also

severely damaged the Soviet economy,  distorting the distribution of

resources between the civil and military sectors.    Progress on arms

control could meet these Soviet concerns by lowering international

tension and allowing the Soviet economy to develop.    Arms control,

handled subtly,  could even improve the Soviet Union&apos;s military

position.



8. Soviet views on how war with the West might be fought may

influence negotiating goals now being pursued:



The West&apos;s strategic nuclear arsenal could inflict grave

damage on the Soviet Union so it is in the Soviet interest

to secure cuts in Western strategic nuclear weapons. But

while the West retains strategic nuclear weapons we must

expect the Soviet Union to keep similar weapons in its

arsenal.



Soviet use of theatre nuclear forces in a European war would

risk escalation to a strategic nuclear exchange. Western

theatre nuclear forces based in Europe could strike Soviet

territory,  and make escalation to intercontinental use more

likely.    It would,  therefore,  be in the Soviet interest to

have all theatre nuclear weapons removed from Europe,

especially those able to strike Soviet territory.    But this

would still leave Europe vulnerable to Soviet strategic

forces which can be used at less than their maximum

ranges.



Soviet military assessments acknowledge that NATO could put

up a formidable conventional defence despite the Warsaw

Pact&apos;s numerical superiority.    But the density of forces

along the front to be defended matters as much as the

overall balance of forces.    If large cuts in NATO forces

could be secured, even at the cost of larger cuts in Warsaw

Pact forces, NATO&apos;s defensive force density might be much



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



lower, and the Warsaw Pact, with the benefit of surprise,

would still be able to concentrate powerful  forces to break

through Western defences.    By contrast,  no comparable

capability exists on the Western side.



9.      This is not to say that we should not seek arms control accords

or that we cannot reach agreements that make both sides more secure.

But objective military strength must be the yardstick for talks. And

the chances of securing such agreements are better if Western public

opinion (which has so often been the real target of superficially

attractive Soviet proposals)  and those involved in the arms control

process fully appreciate the military rationale that underlies Soviet

arms control strategy.

Chapter Two

ARMS CONTROL



01. Significant progress has been made with the West&apos;s arms control

genda.    The latest milestone occurred on 6 March when new talks on

onventional arms control in Europe opened in Vienna.    The West has



et the pace in these talks;  the mandates are based on Western drafts,

nd NATO countries have developed significant proposals for the talks

hemselves.    Moreover,  in the vital area of data,  the Alliance took

he initiative by publishing &quot;Conventional Forces in Europe: The

acts&quot; in November 1988,  to which the Warsaw Pact responded in January

.989 by,  for the first time,  publishing figures on its own force

evels  (see paragraph 608).



02. Two major arms control achievements - the Stockholm Document of

986 and the Intermediate Nuclear Forces  (INF)  Treaty of 1987 - are



)eing successfully implemented, and more progress has been recorded

owards another Western objective,  an agreement reducing US and Soviet



strategic nuclear weapons by 50%. We continue to support all these

nitiatives and to pursue vigorously a global ban on chemical weapons.



CONVENTIONAL ARMS CONTROL



203.  NATO has long maintained that the major threat to stability in

Europe comes from the Warsaw Pact&apos;s capability for surprise attack and

.arge-scale offensive action,  based on its massive superiority in

equipment such as tanks and artillery that can seize and hold

.erritory,  and compounded by the dominant presence in Europe of the

armed forces of the Soviet Union.    As long ago as June 1968, NATO

proposed East-West talks to reduce conventional forces in Europe.

This initiative led to the talks on Mutual and Balanced Force

Reductions  (MBFR), which began in 1973,  in which the West sought

improved stability in Europe.    Many lessons were learned by both sides

but it proved impossible to reach agreement in the face of Warsaw Pact

unwillingness to provide enough data on force levels or to accept

stringent Western proposals on verification.    MBFR ended in February

after agreement had been reached on the mandates for two new

conventional arms control negotiations - the Negotiation on

Conventional Armed Forces in Europe  (CFE),  and the Vienna negotiations

on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures and Disarmament in



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



Europe.    Both sets of talks began in Vienna in March.    The initiative

to hold them was taken by NATO Foreign Ministers at their meeting in

Brussels in December 1986.



Negotiations on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe



204.  CFE involves 23 nations  (the 16 NATO allies and the seven members

of the Warsaw Pact) and, unlike MBFR,  covers the whole of Europe from

the Atlantic to the Urals.    The agreed objectives, which are

consistent with the draft mandate tabled by the West in July 1987, are

to achieve a stable and secure balance at lower levels of forces, as

well as the elimination of disparities and the capacity for launching

surprise attack and large-scale offensive action.    This will require

not only numerical equality between the two sides,  but changes in

deployment patterns and force structures as well.    Given the Warsaw

Pact&apos;s superiority,   reductions to parity will inevitably mean that it

must cut much more than NATO.    A stringent and thorough-going

verification regime,  including on-site challenge inspections, will



so be needed.    NATO&apos;s proposals,  discussed on page  [],   reflect these

iderlying factors.



?x:  Conventional Arms Control - The Alliance&apos;s Proposal



!&apos;.      The proposals tabled by NATO countries in Vienna would enhance

conventional stability in Europe across the board.    Below we describe

the proposals and the objectives they reflect.



2.      At the heart of our concerns is the Warsaw Pact&apos;s overwhelming

superiority in systems such as tanks,  artillery and armoured troop

carriers,  all of which combine high mobility,  protection and fire

power,  and which together provide a capability for seizing and holding

ground.    The first requirement is to eliminate capabilities for

surprise attack and large-scale offensive action by placing an overall

limit on such systems in the area from the Atlantic to the Urals.

NATO has therefore proposed that the combined total of NATO and Warsaw

Pact in each of the three categories,  split equally between the two

sides,  shall not exceed:



4 0,0 00 tanks;



33,000 artillery pieces; and



56,000 armoured troop carriers.



Overall limits alone will not create stability.    We must also ensure

that no one country can dominate Europe by force of arms.    We have

therefore proposed that no one country shall hold more than 30% of the

weapon systems in each of the three categories.



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



3.      These limits on numbers and nationality will not affect one

country&apos;s right to station its forces on another&apos;s territory. But

deployments of this kind can be threatening and destabilising. We

have therefore proposed that no country shall station in another more

 than:



; 3,200 tanks;



1,700 artillery pieces; and



6,000 armoured troop carriers.



84.      These measures would still not be enough to prevent the

concentration of offensive,  ground-gaining forces in particular areas.

We have therefore proposed a series of geographical sub-limits

designed to achieve equal security for all  from the Atlantic to the

Urals.



5. Armaments alone are not a sufficient indicator of military

capability; we also need to cover structure and personnel,  and have

proposed that information on these, broken down to battalion level, be

exchanged annually.    Other supporting measures would be considered.



6. The measures being discussed at CFE are closely linked to the

1e     wider discussions at Vienna on confidence- and security-building



measures, our proposals for which are discussed in paragraph 207.

Without confidence and openness,  traditional arms control  is but a

hollow and fragile shell.



205. The last year has seen announcements by Mr Gorbachev and other

Warsaw Pact leaders that there would be unilateral cuts in defence

spending and in their forces in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

As explained in Chapter 1, we welcome these announcements. In

practical terms,  the reductions,  if implemented,  lessen the imbalances

that need to be addressed in the new negotiations.    But the impact

they would have will have to be seen in perspective;  as the analysis

in Chapter 6 shows, Warsaw Pact forces will still have a massive

superiority.    Moreover, we cannot predict in detail how the promised



&apos;     withdrawals would affect Warsaw Pact forces in Europe.    For these

reasons,  one of the West&apos;s principal aims at Vienna remains the

elimination of imbalances as part of a fully verifiable conventional

  stability regime.



206. The Warsaw Pact has also presented certain ideas at CFE, albeit

not in as specific a form as NATO.    We welcome its recognition of the

substantial disparities that exist in Europe, and its readiness to see



-hejthem removed,  as NATO has long advocated.    Its proposals will need



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



careful examination;  some raise major difficulties,  and several, such

as those for zones of different levels of security,  are not acceptable

to NATO.



Confidence- and Security-Building Measures



207. The second new set of negotiations,  on Confidence- and

Security-Building Measures  (CSBMs),  involves all 35 nations of the

Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.    The agreed aim,

again based on the Western draft of the mandate,  is to build on the

measures agreed in the Stockholm Document (see paragraph 209). NATO

nations have proposed a comprehensive exchange of data on conventional

forces in Europe,  including their structure,  equipment holdings,

manpower strength and location, and the enhancement of the

arrangements in the Stockholm Document as well as measures aimed at

making military activities more open and predictable.    These include

prior notification of activities and on-site observation, with

provision for challenge inspections where doubt exists over compliance

with the agreement.



208. The Warsaw Pact has also made proposals for CSBMs.    Like NATO&apos;s,

these include strengthening the provisions of the Stockholm Document.

They also include a welcome  recognition of the importance of

exchanging military information and the need to improve arrangements

for notifying and observing military activities.    The Warsaw Pact has

also made detailed proposals for negotiations to cover naval and air

activities and for constraining exercises.    The proposals will need

careful examination;  as put forward some would involve limitations on

NATO training activity that might jeopardise security.



Stockholm Document



209. Progress continues to be made in implementing the provisions of

the Stockholm Document  (agreed in September 1986 by the Stockholm

Conference on Disarmament in Europe).    Participating states have taken

seriously the obligations entailed by the Document, whose provisions

were designed to meet the NATO objective of reducing - through greater

openness about military activity on both sides - the likelihood of an

outbreak of hostilities in Europe, whether planned or not.    Since the

Stockholm Document came into force on 1 January 1987 15 Warsaw Pact

exercises,  17 NATO exercises and two by neutral or non-aligned

countries have been observed.    There have also been 18 on-site

inspections,  including four in the Soviet Union and one in this

country.    In April 1988,  the United Kingdom mounted a challenge

inspection of an exercise in the Odessa region of the Soviet Union;

and in October,  the Soviet Union exercised its challenge inspection

rights in a large area of southern England where we were conducting

Home Defence exercises  (see paragraph 304).    In both cases the

inspectors were satisfied about compliance with the Stockholm

Document.    The establishment of regular and uncontroversial

inspections contributes significantly to confidence and stability in

Europe, and is an encouraging basis for the new talks on CSBMs.



NUCLEAR ARMS CONTROL

Intermediate Forces



;210.  The INF Treaty, with its asymmetric cuts and intrusive

verification regime  (two long-standing NATO principles previously

rejected by the Soviet Union),  came into effect on 1 June 1988. Over

a three year period all US and Soviet intermediate-range

ground-launched nuclear missiles will be eliminated.    By June 1991,

Soviet systems able to carry some 1,700 nuclear warheads will have

been destroyed,  as well as some 400 US ground-launched cruise missiles

(GLCMs)  and Pershing II missiles;  72 Pershing 1A missiles operated by

the Federal Republic of Germany but carrying US-owned warheads will

also be destroyed,  although they are not covered by the treaty.



211. In the United Kingdom,  RAF Molesworth has been closed as a GLCM

forward operating base.    Half the missiles from RAF Greenham Common

will be withdrawn in late 1989;  the rest will  return to the United

States in the first half of 1991.    Until then off-base training will

continue in order to maintain the GLCM force&apos;s effectiveness; we shall

give it our full support.



Strategic Forces



212. Following welcome progress in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks

(START)  between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987, based

on US proposals in 1985 to cut the superpowers&apos;  strategic arsenals by

50%,  the talks moved in 1988 into discussion of the development into a

rigorous and practical  regime of the general verification principles

agreed at the Washington Summit in December 1987. Provisional



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



agreement has now been reached on an overall ceiling on the forces of

each side of 6,000 warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles;  and, within

that,  a limitation of 4,900 warheads on ballistic missiles, including

no more than 1,540 on heavy missiles.



213. Definitions of systems and rules for counting them have also been

agreed for ballistic missiles and for bombers carrying free-fall bombs

and short-range attack missiles.    But several complex issues remain to

be  resolved,  including that of separate sub-limits on land-based

missiles,  submarine-launched missiles and warheads carried by

strategic bombers; the treatment of land-based mobile missiles and

sea-launched cruise missiles;  counting rules and range limitations for

air-launched cruise missiles;  and how verification would work.



214. In 1987,  the United States proposed to the Soviet Union a mutual

undertaking not to withdraw until 1994 from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic

Missile Treaty (ABMT).    At the Washington Summit later that year, they

agreed that a Treaty establishing such a non-withdrawal period should

be addressed separately from START,  although the two subjects will

continue to be inter-related.    There is no agreement yet about how

much testing and development is permitted by the ABMT.    The large

phased-array radar at Krasnoyarsk in Central Asia continues to cause

the United States concern as being a violation of the ABMT. The

United States has stated that this issue must be resolved before a

START agreement can be signed.



215. The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed that the

strategic forces of third parties will not be included in START; the

United Kingdom is not a party to the talks.    Our strategic nuclear

force,  even when updated by the acquisition of Trident,   represents the

minimum capability necessary to maintain effective deterrence. Even

after a START treaty, with its proposed cuts of 50% in the present

arsenals of the superpowers,  our Trident force would still  represent a

smaller proportion of Soviet strategic nuclear warheads than its

predecessor Polaris did on its introduction two decades ago. If

Soviet and US strategic arsenals were to be very substantially reduced

and if no significant changes had occurred in Soviet defensive

capabilities, we would want to consider how we could best contribute

to arms control in the light of the reduced threat.    But US and Soviet



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



reductions would have to go very much further than 50% before we could

consider  including the British deterrent in arms control negotiations.



Nuclear Testing



216. Two treaties were signed by the United States and the Soviet

Union in the 1970s to prohibit underground nuclear explosions with a

yield of more than 150 kilotons.    The Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT)

(1974)  applies to explosions to test weapons,  while the Peaceful

Nuclear Explosions Treaty (PNET)   (1976)  applies to explosions carried

out for peaceful purposes.    Although neither has yet been ratified,

both siuts have agreed to comply with them.    Following their agreement

to a step-by-step approach to nuclear testing constraints,  the United

States and the  Soviet Union have  continued the negotiations opened in

November 1987.    Their  first aim is  to  ratify the TTBT and the PNET.

By the end of 1988 there had been significant progress towards the

completion of effective verification protocols for the two treaties,

including a joint experiment held in the United States and the Soviet

Union to demonstrate, hydrodynamic verification methods.    We hope that

these two treaties can be  ratified soon.



217. We support the United States&apos;  intention to follow up ratification

of the TTBT and the PNET with further negotiations but there remain

serious technical problems of verification,  particularly at lower

thresholds.    Progress will be made only by a step-by-step approach

that takes account of technical advances on verification as well as of

progress elsewhere  in arms control and the attitude of other

countries.    A comprehensive test ban remains a long-term goal. For

the foreseeable  future our security will depend on deterrence based on

nuclear weapons,  which must be  tested to ensure  that  they remain

effective and up-to-date.



CHEMICAL WEAPONS



218. The horrors of chemical weapons  in the First-World War led to the

1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting their use in war.(but not their

production).    The  &quot;importance and continuing validity&quot; of the Protocol



^        was  reaffirmed by all 149 countries taking part in the Paris



Conference held in January 1989 at the instigation of President

Reagan.



CONFIDENTIAL

219. The Soviet Union&apos;s chemical warfare (CW) capability, the world&apos;s

largest and most sophisticated,  poses a major threat to NATO. The

Soviet Union,  however,  did not acknowledge until 1987 that it had any

CW capability at all.    In April 1987 Mr Gorbachev admitted to the

existence of such a capability;  later in 1987,  Soviet spokesmen

admitted to a stockpile of 50,000 tonnes of CW agent (we assess the

size of the stockpile to be several times greater than that).

Although the Soviet Union now claims to be committed to greater

openness on CW, many questions,  such as that of the size of the

stockpile,  still  remain,  and,  as shown by our visit to a Soviet CW

facility (see paragraph 224),  Soviet attitudes towards CW remain

characterised by secrecy.



220. There is also a growing danger of worldwide CW proliferation,

exemplified by the use of chemical weapons in the Iran/Iraq conflict

and by the clear evidence of Libya&apos;s efforts to develop a CW

capability.    Export controls on chemicals and equipment needed to make

CW agents can help restrict CW proliferation.    We and many other

Western nations apply such controls;  in February a European Community

regulation came into force on the export of eight chemicals.



221. The best way to deal with the menace of chemical weapons is a

comprehensive and verifiable global ban on their production,

possession and use.    We therefore attach great importance to the

negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament at Geneva for a global

Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) banning chemical weapons,  and we

play a leading role in those talks.    The framework of a CWC is now

agreed in principle.    It includes the following elements:



a declaration by all signatories of their current CW

stockpiles and production facilities;



the verified destruction of all CW stocks and production

facilities over a ten-year period;



verification of civil chemical industries to ensure that

they are not used for clandestine CW production;



scope for signatories to operate one small production



CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL



facility to make CW agents in order to research and develop

protective measures; and



an international organisation to oversee implementation of

the CWC.



222. Much work nevertheless remains to be done on the important

outstanding issues, especially verification; a CWC will need two

levels of verification - routine on-site inspections and,  as a safety

net,  inspection on challenge.    A particular problem is that CW agents

can easily be produced by a relatively unsophisticated chemical

industry.    A verification regime,  including comprehensive and detailed

arrangements for on-site inspections,  must therefore be devised to

monitor the civil chemical industry effectively without disclosing

commercial secrets to competitors.    We are also working on trial

inspections of both civil and military facilities to test the detailed

verification provisions being discussed at Geneva.



223. If negotiations for a CWC are to succeed,  there must also be a

high degree of openness and mutual confidence.    In 1988 we tabled two

papers at Geneva as an initiative in openness;  one was on past British

production of chemical weapons and their later destruction,  the other

on current British commercial production of chemicals that might be

used to make CW agents.



224. An important opportunity to build mutual confidence arose from

our initiation of an exchange of visits between the Chemical Defence

Establishment  (CDE)  at Porton Down and the Soviet CW facility at

Shikhany.    But the visit to Shikhany was disappointing;  for example,

despite repeated requests,  the British delegation was denied access to

a complex that satellite photography (see  [below])  shows to be clearly

associated with the Shikhany facility.    Moreover,  only munitions and

agents that would have been available in the 1950s and earlier were

displayed,  although it is very hard to believe that the Soviet Union

has not taken advantage of the advances of the last 30 years in

military and chemical technologies.



225. This secrecy and evasiveness was especially disappointing given

our openness during the earlier Soviet visit to CDE.    In particular,



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



we gave the visitors a helicopter flight over the entire site and

invited them to select and visit any points of interest on the CDE

site or adjacent facilities.    The Soviet delegation welcomed our

openness but, as described above,  it was not reciprocated at sfcikhany.

A useful confidence-building opportunity was thus missed.



226. The Soviet Union has announced that it is to begin destroying its

CW stockpile later this year  (the United States had already begun a

unilateral destruction programme),  but without yet saying how much it

will destroy nor in what timescale.    In contrast,  the United States

announced at the opening of the CFE that it would accelerate

withdrawal of its CW stocks from the Federal Republic of Germany,

previously planned to be completed by 1992,  and called on the Soviet

Union to accelerate its destruction of its much larger CW stocks. We

look forward to a positive Soviet response to this initiative,  and to

greater openness on the Soviet Union&apos;s part about its CW stockpile and

capabilities.



THE WAY AHEAD



227. NATO will continue to pursue arms control vigorously as part of

its security policy.    When NATO Ministers reviewed their arms control

aims at Reykjavik in 1987,  they agreed that the INF agreement would be

an important element in a coherent and comprehensive concept of arms

control and disarmament, which, while consistent with NATO&apos;s strategy

of flexible response, would include:



a 50% reduction in the strategic offensive nuclear weapons

of the United States and the Soviet Union,  to be achieved

during the current Geneva negotiations;



the global elimination of chemical weapons;



the establishment of a stable and secure level of

conventional forces, by the elimination of disparities, in

the whole of Europe; and



in conjunction with the establishment of a conventional

balance and the global elimination of chemical weapons,

tangible and verifiable reductions of US and Soviet



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



land-based nuclear missile systems of shorter range, leading

to equal ceilings.



These aims were reaffirmed by the NATO summit meeting^in March 1988,

which recognised the urgency and central importance of addressing the

conventional force imbalances in Europe, and also reaffirmed the need

for nuclear forces based in Europe for the foreseeable future.



228. Thinking on the way ahead is being further developed in the

comprehensive concept of arms control and disarmament commissioned by

Ministers in June 1987.    An interim report on the concept was

presented to Ministers in December;  a complete report will be

submitted later this year.    It will reflect the continuing validity of

the Harmel principles of adequate military strength and constructive

dialogue and cooperation,  take into account developments in East-West

relations and the military realities underlying Alliance security, and

set out the relationship between NATO&apos;s defence and arms control

policies.    The concept will thus seek to establish the principles that

will guide NATO in the pursuit and evolution of its arms control

objectives.



229. No one can be sure that agreements will be reached easily or at

all.    But the clear signs of change in the internal and external

policies of the Soviet Union suggest that new opportunities are

opening up to build on the progress already achieved. NATO&apos;s

ambitious arms control agenda provides a practical setting within

which these opportunities can be sensibly and fully explored,  and the

hope held out of a major step forward in European and world security.



Essay : Deterrence after the INF Treaty



1.      The central aim of the Alliance&apos;s defence effort is clear and

simple:  to remove the option of war permanently from the East/West

scene.    Nuclear weapons have made this aim wholly compelling,  and for

that very reason wholly attainable.    Their virtually infinite

destructive power has made nonsense of the idea of war as a contest of

strength.    That result is irreversible,  since it rests on scientific

knowledge that cannot be forgotten.    The right course is not to

attempt vainly to dissolve it, but to build around it a war-prevention

system that, without surrendering the great stability we have now,

will become progressively less costly and less abrasive.



The goal must be a system giving each side thorough assurance -



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



grounded,  amid the strains of a changing world,  not on beliefs about

attitude or motive but on objective military fact - that the other

neither has nor seeks options for resolving differences by force. If

the East shares that goal,  it can increasingly be attained through

open and well-understood policies cancelling war not through the

brandishing of armaments but through their quiet maintenance at the

lowest level needed to ensure that the utter irrationality of

aggression remains a plain certainty.



3. Much that President Gorbachev has said encourages us to hope that

he may see the central security need increasingly as we do. There

seems ground for optimism that,  both in the extensive arms-control

agenda and elsewhere,  he will be ready to work with us towards a less

tense and costly security system.    The Soviet Union still has much

larger forces in most categories, and its strategic situation is not

the same as the West&apos;s;  its priorities therefore are different. But

with agreement on the central goal, patient and clear-sighted work can

bring both parties steadily closer to it in safety.



4. The 1987 INF Treaty, achieved as growing Soviet realism converged

with NATO steadfastness, was a major advance in easing tension and

building confidence.    Its content was specific and exact - the

strictly-verified abolition of a defined class of missiles. Nothing

in it implies an agreement to abandon operational roles or strategies,

or leave a hole in the middle of NATO&apos;s ability to respond flexibly.



5. Flexible response is the only strategic concept that makes sense

for a defensive alliance in the nuclear age.    Military victory in the

classical sense is not feasible;  the use of force at any level, but

especially the nuclear level,  can have no other aim than to deny an

aggressor swift success and to show him that he has underrated the

defender&apos;s resolve and must,  for his own survival, back off. The

circumstances in which this task arose could vary greatly;  the defence

must therefore have a wide range of options,  enabling it to react to

any military situation promptly and with the least force needed for

the basic political aim of ending the war.      Nothing in the INF Treaty

makes this strategy less apt than before,  or  reduces the need to

ensure,  through the manifest ability to implement it in credible ways,

that aggression can never be attractive.



6. For flexible response NATO has to maintain an effective nuclear

armoury at several levels.    Strategic weapons alone,  for all their

awesome power,  could not be either morally tolerable, practically

feasible or politically credible for every scenario.    Our needs at

non-strategic levels will continue to evolve in line with our

arms-control commitments,  with new technology and with deeper

understanding on both sides of the minimum imperatives of

mutually-assured security.    NATO has made major cuts in its

non-strategic armoury; the number of warheads in Europe is now 35%

less than in 1979,  and will  fall  further by mid-1991.    The INF

Treaty&apos;s abolition of intermediate-range missiles follows past NATO

decisions to abandon successively nuclear infantry weapons, nuclear

anti-aircraft missiles and nuclear land-mines.



7. Cuts in the armoury can go further yet,  and the Alliance is

working on the possibilities.    But the aim for which the armoury as a

whole exists, of surely preventing war,  cannot be served if we attempt

to follow simultaneously both the path of cuts and the path of

obsolescence.    Nuclear weapons are not mere symbols;  like other



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



weapons,  they can deter only by evident capability for effective use.

Modern technology offers major improvements in range,  accuracy and

target-acquisition,  and these can enable us to cut weapon numbers.

But there is no prudent basis for making the cuts without the

improvements.



8. NATO is studying how to keep up-to-date its armoury of warheads

supported by the provision of delivery systems and basing

arrangements in which European nations rightly share the burden.

NATO&apos;s military authorities have reported on this to the Nuclear

Planning Group.    Ministers will consider the steps that need to be

taken,  for example replacing the Lance missile,  to keep the armoury as

a whole at the standard of effectiveness and versatility,  and no

larger than the minimum size,  needed to sustain its purpose.



9. The United Kingdom will continue to play a full part in this

effort, and also to maintain the independent non-strategic

contribution without which the value of our strategic force, which

provides a separate second centre of nuclear decision-making in

support of Alliance strategy, would be seriously incomplete. Our

non-strategic contribution has since the 1960s rested on WE177

free-fall weapons, usable from various aircraft and in various roles.

For technical and operational  reasons these cannot all be  relied upon

beyond the 1990s.    As with the rest of the Western armoury, numbers

and types may not have to be kept at present levels;  that needs

further study.    But,  under the strategy of flexible  response, the

basic need for some non-strategic weapons will  remain,  and procurement

lead-times mean that initial decisions on modernisation - particularly

on the choice of an air-launched missile to which warhead work at

Aldermaston will be geared - must be taken before long.



10. Work like this has its full counterpart on the Soviet side.

Nothing that President Gorbachev has said or done is ground for

imagining that he will  run military risks with his country&apos;s security

on suppositions about Western goodwill.    We must be similarly

objective,   recognising that if there is indeed a Soviet re-assessment

enabling us all to work together more constructively,  it would be

folly to dismantle,  or let decay,  the very structures that have helped

to induce it.    Cool and steady realism of this kind is not an obstacle

but the best guide to strengthening the security system we seek - one

in which the total neutralisation of war,  by agreed

non-confrontational means,  becomes so sure,  accepted and permanent

that,  even when interests may differ widely,  nations of East and West

can conduct their business together by means in which the thought of

armed conflict simply plays no part.

Chapter Three



THE ARMED  FORCES:   ROLES AND EQUIPMENT



301. In Chapter 1, we described the major elements of British defence

policy.    This chapter describes the  roles,  commitments and activities

of the Services,  both in NATO and out of area,  in support of that

policy,  and gives details of the Services&apos;  equipment programmes.



BRITAIN&apos;S MAIN DEFENCE ROLES  IN NATO



302. The vast majority of our forces are committed to four main roles

in NATO and make a major contribution to the Alliance strategies of

flexible response and forward defence:



Nuclear Forces.    For 20 years the Royal Navy&apos;s Polaris

submarines have carried our independent strategic nuclear

deterrent.    In the mid-1990s they will be replaced by

Trident missile-carrying submarines (see paragraph 323).

All three Services contribute towards our theatre nuclear

forces.    The British free-fall nuclear bomb can be delivered

by the RAF&apos;s Tornado GRl and Buccaneer aircraft,  and by the

Royal Navy&apos;s Sea Harriers.    Royal Navy anti-submarine

helicopters and the RAF&apos;s Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft

can deliver nuclear depth-bombs,  provided by the United

States in the case of the Nimrod.    The Army has one regiment

of Lance surface-to-surface missiles and four regiments of

nuclear-capable artillery;  all these have US nuclear

warheads.



Defence of the United Kingdom. The RAF, supported by the

Royal Navy, provides the air defence of the United Kingdom

and the surrounding seas. The Royal Navy and the RAF help

to protect the Atlantic supply routes, and the Navy&apos;s mine

counter-measures vessels combat the threat of mines to our

ports and coastal waters. Over 100,000 personnel (both

Regular and Reserve) of all Services are available for the

ground defence of the United Kingdom.



Defence of the European Mainland. The British Army of the

Rhine  (BAOR), based in the Federal Republic of Germany, is



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



the largest part of our forces on the Continent, and

contributes l(BR)Corps to the Northern Army Group. RAF

Germany,  consisting of 15 squadrons of aircraft, contributes

to the Second Allied Tactical Air Force.    We also have

forces for the rapid reinforcement of NATO&apos;s flanks

(discussed on page  [])  supported as necessary by the RAF&apos;s

transport force.    We have forces in Gibraltar and Berlin not

assigned to NATO.    As part of our drive for

cost-effectiveness, we are considering restructuring the

garrison in Gibraltar,  and we plan to withdraw all or most

of the infantry battalion stationed there within the next

three years.



- Maritime Forces in the Eastern Atlantic and Channel areas.

Ships,  submarines and aircraft of the Royal Navy,  and RAF

aircraft contribute to forward defence through forward

maritime operations in the Atlantic and adjacent seas and to

maritime operations in the shallow seas.    They provide

forces to protect the deployment of the strategic deterrent,

to contain the Soviet Northern Fleet and to ensure the safe

arrival of reinforcement and resupply shipping.



Box  :  Specialist Reinforcement Forces for NATO



1. Besides the forces we already commit to the Central Region

(paragraph 302),  we make available to NATO&apos;s Supreme Allied Commanders

for Europe and the Atlantic highly trained,   ready and mobile forces as

part of NATO&apos;s specialist reinforcements.



2. We contribute national contingents to two NATO reinforcement

formations:



- Allied Command Europe Mobile Force  (AMF).    The AMF is a

multi-national force of about brigade size with air support.

We provide a land element of some 2,300 men equipped for

arctic warfare,  composed of an infantry battalion group, a

logistic support battalion and supporting arms and services,

including four Puma helicopters.



SACEUR&apos;s Strategic Reserve  (Air)  (SSR(A)).    The SSR(A)  is a

force of British and US squadrons.    We provide one Harrier

and two Tornado squadrons,  and Canberras equipped for

electronic warfare and counter-measures operations.



3. We provide most of a bi-national force,  the United Kingdom and

Netherlands Amphibious Force.    Our share consists of 3 Commando

Brigade Royal Marines and amphibious ships and helicopters, while the

Dutch provide a battalion-sized Amphibious Combat Group.    It is

trained for the arctic winter;  its most likely deployment would be to

Northern Norway,  although there are other options.



s



4.      We also provide the United Kingdom Mobile Force (UKMF) and

Regional Air Reinforcement Squadrons (RRS).    The UKMF is an infantry

brigade with supporting arms and services,  including RAF helicopters;

it would reinforce the Baltic Approaches.    The RRS comprise the

equivalent of four squadrons of aircraft;  three are operational Jaguar

 t Hsquadrons that would be deployed in Northern Norway and Denmark to



support in-place NATO forces including the AMF. The fourth comprises

Harriers from the Operational Conversion Unit and would reinforce the

RAF&apos;s Harrier force in the Federal Republic.



(Figure 1 - Deployment of the Armed Forces early 1989)

Training



303.  To remain effective,  the Services must train continuously and

realistically.    But training can have a damaging impact on the

environment and on those who live near airfields and exercise areas,

[and we are always seeking ways to improve safety and reduce

disruption.    One way is to use command post exercises,  which test

command and control procedures without involving forces in the field.

WINTEX-CIMEX,  a large-scale biennial NATO command post exercise, took

place in February and March to test the Alliance&apos;s crisis management

organisation against a setting of rising international tension leading

to war.

304. Defence of the United Kingdom.    We test our air defence system

regularly;  in October,  for example,  seven NATO air forces took part in

Exercise ELDER JOUST.    This three-day exercise involved some 130

aircraft,  and practised interception,  air-to-air refuelling and

electronic warfare;  it ran concurrently with Exercise ARC,  the first

ever jointly-organised Anglo-French air defence exercise.    In the

autumn,  Military Home Defence field training exercises were held

throughout the country.    They involved all three Services, including

Reserve Forces,  some elements of US forces based here and several

civilian agencies.    The Royal Navy and the Royal Naval Reserve

practised mine counter-measures in a number of exercises in the year,

including NORMINEX in May 1988.



305. Defence of the European Mainland.    In April and May 1988, the

British forces assigned to the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force

(AMF)   (see page  [])  deployed to Belgium for Exercise ARDENT GROUND; in

June,  RAF aircraft took part in the Central Region tactical flying

exercise, CENTRAL ENTERPRISE.    The late summer saw two major exercises

in Europe:  the United Kingdom Mobile Force and elements of the RAF

took part in BOLD GROUSE in Denmark,  and British elements of the AMF

eployed to Turkey for ALLY EXPRESS.    BAOR&apos;s main field exercise, IRON

AMMER,   took place  in November;   it  involved 3 Armoured Division and

ome  3,300 Regular Army and TA personnel based in the United Kingdom.

Early this year,  Royal Marines and Army personnel undertook their

annual arctic warfare training in Norway,  and took part in the

!Norwegian joint exercise,  COLD WINTER 89,  with US and Dutch forces.



306. The major NATO maritime exercise,  TEAMWORK 88, was held in August

and September.    This was one of a biennial series of exercises in the

vlorth Atlantic and Norwegian Sea to practise forward maritime defence

and the reinforcement of NATO&apos;s northern flank,  and included

amphibious reinforcement landings in North Norway by 3,600 Royal

Marines,  4,000 US Marines and 800 Royal Netherlands Marines.    Over 200

ships,  500 aircraft and 45,000 personnel from nine NATO nations took

part.    In May 1988,  Exercise OPEN GATE tested the coordination of

maritime forces in the Eastern Atlantic and included the handover of a

convoy to DRAGON HAMMER,  an annual amphibious and air exercise in the

Western Mediterranean.    Exercises TRADE DAGGER and EXPANDED SEA tested

NATO&apos;s ability to protect and control merchant ships carrying

reinforcements and supplies.    During the year,  three Joint Maritime

Courses gave the Royal Navy and the RAF the opportunity to exercise

intensive combined operations with allied forces.    The Royal Navy kept

up its commitments to the three NATO naval formations,  the Standing

Naval Force Atlantic,  the Standing Naval Force Channel and the Naval

On-Call Force Mediterranean.    In May 1988,  HMS Superb and HMS

Turbulent surfaced simultaneously at the North Pole,  the first Royal

Navy submarines to have done so.



307. The exercise programme for the rest of 1989 will  follow the

pattern of previous years,  involving units of all three Services.

Exercises will include SHARP SPEAR,  to test NATO&apos;s ability to maintain

control of the shallow seas off North West Europe through a period of

tension leading to hostilities,  and DRAGON HAMMER 89 in the

Mediterranean.

FOCUS  (reported in last year&apos;s Statement)  proved our ability to

reinforce  the  islands.    We will be  responsible  for  the defence and

security of Hong Kong until 1997; we will consult the Hong Kong

Government over all decisions on the phased withdrawal of the garrison

as 1997 approaches.    In a routine adjustment of force levels 3 Raiding

Squadron Royal Marines and two of the five Hong Kong patrol craft were

withdrawn in 1988.    There has been no change in our forces in Brunei,

Belize and Cyprus.



309.  The Royal Navy&apos;s ARMILLA Patrol has been in the Gulf and Indian

Ocean area since 1980, providing reassurance and protection for

British merchant shipping.    From September 1987 until March this year,

itwas augmented by mine counter-measures vessels  (see page []).

While the threat to merchant ships,was at its greatest,  the Patrol

accompanied 1,026 transits of British merchant ships through the

Straits of Hormuz;  no vessel was ever attacked in its company. After

the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq and the return of confidence among

merchant shipping,  we judged that the threat was low enough for

ARMILLA to revert to independent patrols from 1 November 1988. It

will stay in the area for as long as there is a job for it to do.



Box:  Minesweeping in the Gulf



1. In September 1987 four Royal Navy mine counter-measures (MCM)

vessels arrived in the Gulf to augment our ARMILLA Patrol (see

paragraph 309),  and to counter the threat to shipping from mines in

the Gulf.    With MCM vessels from the United States,  France,  Italy, the

Netherlands and Belgium,  they have cleared several mine danger areas,

and checked hundreds of miles of shipping lanes.    Vessels from the

European navies have successfully carried out mine-clearance

operations coordinated under the auspices of the Western European

Union,  and proved the ability and will of the nations involved to

maintain freedom of navigation in international waters.



2. There was especially close cooperation between the MCM forces of

the Royal Navy and the Dutch and Belgian Navies.    From the start we

gave the Dutch and Belgians some logistic support and, when needed,

protection.    In July 1988 this process culminated in the creation of

an integrated MCM force called CALENDAR (named after the joint

Anglo-Dutch-Belgian operation to clear the Scheldt Estuary of mines in

1944-45)  composed of five MCM vessels - three Royal Navy,  one Dutch

and one Belgian - and two British support ships.



3. In October, CALENDAR and the MCM forces of the other WEU

countries began Operation CLEANSWEEP,  a coordinated check of a

shipping lane 2,000 yards wide and 300 miles into the Gulf from the

Straits of Hormuz.    CLEANSWEEP, which ended successfully in January,

%ras a practical contribution both to the safety of merchant shipping

and to  returning  regional  stability.     It was a good example of

cooperation by European navies beyond the NATO area.



on    4_      Once CLEANSWEEP and other  route  survey work  for Gulf littoral

states was over,   there were no tasks,  outside the politically tense



n9    waters of the Northern Gulf,  needing the sophisticated minesweeping



re    and minehunting equipment of the British MCM vessels.    Floating mines

that break free from their moorings in the Northern Gulf and drift on



?      the surface may well pose a small and unpredictable threat to the



safety of shipping.    But MCM vessels have no special ability to detect

such mines, which can be destroyed without sophisticated equipment.

Our MCM vessels were much needed for high priority NATO tasks, and

therefore returned to home waters in March without being replaced.

But three remain ready to return at short notice if needed.



310. There were two major out-of-area deployments, OUTBACK 88 and

GOLDEN EAGLE,  described on page  [].    Smaller exercises included PURPLE



ENTURE,  a tri-Service command post exercise on Ascension Island

ounted from the United Kingdom,  and a communications exercise, OPAL



MERCURY,  in Malaysia and Singapore.    Exercises in 1989 will include a



ng



deployment by the Royal Navy and a landing force of Royal Marines to

the Caribbean in the early summer,  and a joint communications exercise

by the Army and RAF in the middle of the year.

1. 1988 saw major Royal Navy and RAF deployments to the Far East and

he    Australia.    The Royal Navy&apos;s OUTBACK 88 Task Group,  comprising HM



?      Ships Ark Royal,  Edinburgh,  and Si rius and the RFAs Fort Grange,



Orangeleaf and Olwen,  visited 14 countries in its six-month deployment

to and from Australia.     In the RAF deployment,  GOLDEN EAGLE, four

Tornado F3 air defence aircraft, assisted by tanker and support

aircraft,  took part in exercises and demonstrations in the Far East.

Both deployments took part in major exercises with our partners in the

Five Power Defence Arrangements  (FPDA)  - Malaysia, Singapore,



f     Australia and New Zealand - and in the Australian Bicentennial



celebrations,  and showed that our Armed Forces can fulfil a variety of

out-of-area commitments,  in conditions very different from those of

the NATO area.

2. OUTBACK units contributed to two FPDA exercises:  in July,  Si rius

took part in the maritime exercise,  STARFISH;  in September, Ark Royal

and Edinburgh,  and their aircraft,  played an important role in the

annual air defence exercise LIMA BERSATU.    In the South China Sea,

ships of the Task Group,  together with Gurkhas flown in from Hong Kong

by the RAF,  took part in a tri-service exercise,  SETIA KAWAN, with the

Sultan of Brunei&apos;s armed forces.    The ships arrived in Sydney for the

Australian Bicentennial Naval Review on 1 October,  at which HRH the

Duke of York,  serving in Edinburgh,  took the salute.    Ark Royal&apos;s Sea

Harriers took part  in the Richmond Air Show later  that month.    On its

return journey,  the Task Group visited several Australian ports.



GOLDEN EAGLE



3.      GOLDEN EAGLE&apos;S  four Tornados and a VC10K tanker,  operating from

RMAF Butterworth in Malaysia,  were the largest ever RAF contribution

 o LIMA BERSATU.    Before going to Australia the Tornados carried out

joint air defence training with the Royal Thai Air Force and flew

demonstration flights in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. In

Australia,  the Tornados,  together with Tristar and Nimrod aircraft and

the RAF&apos;s Falcons parachute team,  took part in the Richmond Air Show.

The Tornados and their support aircraft then flew across the Pacific

to the United States.    There they took part in international air shows

before completing their circumnavigation of the globe in returning to

the United Kingdom.



311. Our extensive programme of military assistance overseas

continues;  in 1987-88,  some 560 Service personnel were on loan service

in 33 countries outside NATO, and over 3,000 students from such

countries attended military training courses in the United Kingdom.



312. We continue to provide contingents to the Multinational Force

and Observers Group in Sinai and the United Nations (UN)  forces in

Cyprus;  the Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus give logistic support to UN

forces on the island,  in Lebanon and on the Golan Heights.    Since the

last Statement, UN Security Council Resolution 435, which calls for

the withdrawal of South African troops from Namibia and elections

leading to independence, has been implemented.    A UN Transition

Assistance Group is now in Namibia to monitor the troop withdrawal and

elections; we are contributing a signal squadron to handle the force&apos;s

communications.



]NORTHERN IRELAND



1313. Supporting the Royal Ulster Constabulary in fighting terrorism

 remains the biggest peacetime commitment for the Services as a whole:

? the Army provides ten major Regular units (six resident battalions and

!four on roulement tours) and nine battalions of the Ulster Defence

!Regiment (UDR);  the Royal Navy carries out patrols against arms

 smuggling;  the Royal Marines support both Navy and Army operations;

 and the RAF performs many air-support tasks.

314.  There was a resurgence of terrorist activity in 1988, associated



with the  IRA&apos;s acquisition of unprecedented amounts of modern .



sophisticated munitions,  especially the powerful plastic explosive ^



Semtex.    In Northern Ireland 33 soldiers  (mostly off-duty and unarmed) H.



- including 12 members of the UDR - and one Royal Navy civilian b



recruiting officer were murdered by terrorists,  and 229 were injured. t



Four Servicemen were murdered by the IRA on the Continent,  while the i



explosion at the Inglis barracks in Mill Hill killed one soldier. ,



315:.. We have taken major steps to improve security in Northern ?



Ireland.    In particular,  HQ 3 Infantry Brigade was re-established on 1 L

July to coordinate Service activities along the border with the

Republic of Ireland;  this has allowed the other two brigades to focus



more effectively on other areas of high threat. w



b 



316.  These steps and the professionalism and hard work of the L(



Services,  aided by the careful exploitation of intelligence,  prevented e,



the terrorists from raising their campaign of violence to the level W(

they planned.    Countless lives were thus saved and many successes



achieved.    In 1988 219 people were charged with serious offences, Si



including 23 for murder and 46 for attempted murder;  127 were 3 



convicted of serious terrorist-related offences.    Five admitted p:



terrorists were killed by the security forces in Northern Ireland; a,



three were blown up by their own devices. Three IRA terrorists were 0l

killed by the security forces in Gibraltar,  averting the deaths of



many innocent people.    552 weapons and 105,000 rounds of ammunition 3;



were seized.    Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams responded to oi



1,248 calls;  205 bombs were made safe, more than any year since 1976.  5 



Tragically,  one member of a team was murdered in a bomb attack in he



July.    Nine and a half tonnes of explosives found or neutralised&apos;.    The! |ar



continuing and outstanding dedication and courage of servicemen and ej



women was recognised by 183 awards for gallantry. e 



THE SERVICES AND THE COMMUNITY Di



The Volunteer Reserves 32



317.  The Volunteer Reserves play a vital part in our defence effort, re



as discussed in the essay on page  [].    Since April 1979,  their ca



strength has increased from 73,500 to 90,600.    Although recruiting isl th



healthy,  the level of turnover is disappointingly high.    Several ai



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



measures to cut the turnover  rate are in hand or under study,

including imaginative and flexible training arrangements.    We are also

doing more to enlist the support of employers;  in September we

launched the Volunteer Reserve Forces Campaign,  to remind them of the

benefits of Reserve service both for the nation and for the businesses

that employ Volunteers,  and to raise public awareness of the

importance of the Reserves to our defence.    The  response of employers

has been most encouraging.



Bomb Disposal



318. Service EOD teams received 5,207  requests for help in 1988

outside Northern Ireland  (see paragraph 316).    Of these,  4,399 were

conventional munitions,  and 85 were terrorist devices;  the other 723



ere false alarms or hoaxes.      In November,  clearing a German 5001b

bomb of Second World War vintage near Billingsgate fish market in

London forced the closure of the Docklands Light Railway and the

evacuation of 400 local people.    Other tasks included removing First

orld War chemical munitions found at Bramley in Hampshire.



Search and Rescue



319. The Royal Navy and RAF search and rescue  (SAR)  service exists

primarily for aircrew who have to abandon their aircraft; but it also

assists civilians,  rescuing hundreds each year.    SAR teams were called

out 1,896 times in 1988 and rescued or assisted 1,234 people.



320. In last year&apos;s Statement we reported that we were studying ways

of improving military SAR helicopter coverage.    As a result of this

study, we will shorten the call-out times of the Royal Navy&apos;s Sea King

helicopters at Prestwick and Culdrose, and the number of dedicated RAF

and Royal Navy units equipped with the Sea King will  rise from four to

eight.    Coverage of the country as a whole will be much better,

especially at night and in bad weather.



Disaster Relief



321. Overseas,  the Services continued to be involved in disaster

relief operations.    Hurricane Gilbert hit Jamaica on 12 September,

causing widespread damage.    HMS Active and RFA Oakleaf were soon on

the scene with emergency help, RAF Hercules aircraft took part in an

airlift,  and an Army team from Belize worked on the island from 16

September until 3 October,  conducting many major repairs.    Nepal was

struck by a severe earthquake on 21 August; British military medical

personnel treated over 700 Nepalese casualties and carried out over

300 operations.



322. The Services have also helped the community at home.    After the

tragic air disasters at Lockerbie and at Kegworth on the Ml,  all three

Services gave help:  at Lockerbie,  up to 500 personnel were involved in

such tasks as recovering wreckage and searching for bodies; similar

but.more limited help was given at Kegworth.    Ships from the Standing

Naval Force Atlantic (see paragraph 306)  and RAF aircraft took part in

the.&apos; rescue operation after the Piper Alpha oil  rig disaster,  while RFA

Bayleaf provided refuelling support and a Navy Sea King helicopter

flew a medical team to the support ship Tharos.    For eight months,

following a request from the Home Office,  up to 500 Service personnel

staffed two temporary prisons at Army camps,  one at Rollestone on

Salisbury Plain and the other at Alma-Dettingen in Surrey.



SERVICE EQUIPMENT

The Royal Navy



323. Progress continues on the Trident programme.    The construction of

HMS Vanguard and HMS Victorious is making good progress despite the

strike at the builders last year; we do not expect the date of entry

into service to be affected.    We plan to place the order for the third

of the four submarines later this year.    In the United States, the

Trident D-5 missile programme is on course;  test firings on a land

range have been completed and test firings from the US Navy&apos;s Trident

submarine Tennessee began in March.    Progress continues on the

manufacture of the warhead at the Atomic Weapons Establishments, while

several new support facilities at the Clyde Submarine Base were

completed in 1988.    The latest estimate of the programme&apos;s cost,

announced in January,  is  9,089 million.    As this slight increase over

the previous estimate is well below the level of inflation,  the real

cost continues to fall.



324.  The Royal Navy&apos;s conventional forces continue to be improved,

the five Trafalgar class nuclear-powered Fleet submarines ordered

since May 1979,  three are in service;  the latest,  HMS Trenchant,

entered service in February this year.    The fourth,  HMS Talent, is

?planned to enter service in 1990.    These vessels will greatly

!strengthen the Navy&apos;s anti-submarine warfare  (ASW)  capability. Four

!conventionally-powered submarines are also on order;  the first, HMS



Upholder,  is expected to enter service later this year.    We remain

committed to maintaining a force of about 50 destroyers and frigates,

[within a total fleet,  including submarines and RFAs,  of about 200

;vessels.    Three Type 22 frigates entered service in 1988-89. Another,



the last of the eight ordered since 1979,  is due to enter service



later this year,  as is HMS Norfolk,  the first of the Duke class Type

i23? frigates.    There are six more Type 23 frigates on order,  and the



second of the class,  HMS Marlborough, was launched in January. We

;expect to hold a competition later this year for a further batch of

!Type 23s.    This class will form the backbone of the Navy&apos;s ASW surface

[force beyond 2000.



325. Earlier this year HMS Quorn,  the last of the Hunt class mine

[counter-measures  (MCM) vessels on order,  and HMS Sandown,  the first of

a new class of single role minehunters, were delivered by their

builder.    Four more of the Sandown class are being built.    We have

invited tenders for an Aviation Support Ship to provide dedicated

helicopter lift for amphibious operations.    We are also considering

the results of feasibility studies on replacing the assault ships HMS

Fearless and HMS Intrepid,  in parallel with those of a study on the

option of extending the lives of the existing ships.



326 .  Further orders for -Sea Harriers are planned.    Major programmes

are in hand to upgrade existing naval aircraft,  including a mid-life

update for the Sea Harrier to enhance its weapon systems and

improvements to the Sea King helicopter&apos;s sonar to improve its ASW

capability.    The development of the Anglo-Italian Merlin  (EH101) ASW

helicopter continues.    The air training ship RFA Argus, which replaces

RFA Engadine,  completed her trials early this year;  she provides the

Navy with much improved helicopter training facilities.    Two of a new

class of Auxiliary Oiler Replenishment Vessels are being built. The

Navy&apos;s warstocks generally meet national and NATO requirements.

The Army



327.  In the last year we have strengthened BAOR by introducing a sixth

regiment of Challenger tanks; a seventh is on order.    The conversion

of 24 Brigade to the air-mobile role is well under way;  it will

include an Army Air Corps Regiment,  consisting of anti-tank and

?utility Lynx and Gazelle helicopters,  and will be supported by RAF

Chinook and Puma helicopters.    Deliveries of Warrior continue, with

three battalions&apos; worth now delivered to time and to cost. Deliveries

!of the Saxon armoured personnel carrier are now complete. The

!Chieftain tank must be replaced as soon as practicable,  and Vickers

Defence Systems have been given the opportunity to show that they can

deliver Challenger 2 Mk 2 to specification,  time and cost.    We shall

fund this demonstration phase, which will last until the end of

September 1990.    Precise performance and technical criteria have been

laid down against which we will measure the progress of the

demonstration phase.    Vickers must also show that improved ammunition

for the tank&apos;s main gun can be developed when needed and to the



Istandard needed to defeat future Soviet armour.

collaborative family of third generation anti-tank missile systems

(TRIGAT).    The LAW 80 man-portable anti-tank weapon is now in service;

we continue to introduce the infantry weapon SA 80,  the S10 respirator

and battlefield thermal imaging equipment.    Looking ahead, we will

replace towed Rapier with the advanced Rapier 2000  (Field Standard C),

and we will form a third air defence regiment,  armed with the new High

Velocity Missile.    Also planned to enter service in the next few years

are the Multiple-Launch Rocket System,  the Phoenix remotely-piloted

vehicle,  and the Challenger armoured repair and recovery vehicle. The

Army continues to invest heavily in warstocks to improve the

sustainabi1ity of its operations;  its stockholdings generally meet

NATO and national requirements.

329. We continue to improve the air defence of the United Kingdom; six

out of 12 mobile  radars for the UK Air Defence Ground Environment

ystem are now operational,  and we expect the rest to enter service

oon.    The Lightning air defence aircraft was withdrawn in 1988 after

8 years of excellent service.    Three squadrons of the Tornado F3,

hich replaces the Lightnings and some Phantoms,  are now operational,

nd we have ordered 15 more F3s to counter predicted peacetime losses,

  1988 a Memorandum of Understanding and a development contract were

igned for the European Fighter Aircraft, which will  replace the

emaining Phantoms and Jaguars.



30. The first squadron of Harrier GR5s will be declared operational

ater this year.    We have ordered 26 more Tornado GRls against

jredicted peacetime losses.    We placed a contract on Panavia in March

989 for improvements to the GRl, especially to its night capability,

evelopment of the Air-Launched Anti-Radar Missile for the GRl is

)roceeding satisfactorily under a new contract, and there have been



11]  successful air-launched test firings.    The ability of our

ront-line airfields in RAF Germany to operate in wartime has been

much improved by the redeployment this year of a Royal Engineers

quadron for airfield damage repair.



31. The first of the RAF&apos;s Tristar air-to-air refuelling tankers,

modified to carry freight as well,  is now in service.    The Tucano

)asic training aircraft began to enter service in June 1988. The

:irst Skynet 4 military communications satellite for all three



Services was successfully launched at the end of 1988; more will

Eollow.    RAF warstocks generally meet both national and NATO

HE MERCHANT FLEET



332. In the past year the fall in the number of merchant ships on the

United Kingdom and dependent territory registers suitable for defence

 urposes has slowed.    It remains to be seen if the present  return to



elative stability,  at a level that is still generally above that

eeded to meet the wartime needs of the British armed forces, will

last but the signs are encouraging.    The industry has returned to

Profitability,  orders for new ships have risen sharply and cargo rates

are also rising.



333. Three measures will give the industry a further boost: the

Merchant Shipping Act 1988 enables the Government to provide financial

 ssistance for the training and travel costs of British merchant



eamen and to set up a Merchant Navy Reserve;  the Finance Act 1988

hanged the foreign earnings deduction rules to enable more seamen to

enefit from tax relief available to those who work mainly overseas

nd spend most of the year abroad;  and Business Expansion Scheme

rrangements for shipowners have been expanded to encourage

nvestment.    We also seek agreements with major flags-of-convenience

tates so that we can use British-owned vessels on their  register; an

greement with the Bahamas Government was signed last June.    We are

nderpinning this by arranging for these vessels to be covered by the

omprehensive war risk insurance arrangements already available to

hips on the British register.



34. NATO&apos;s Planning Board for Ocean Shipping has recommended that

lations take similar action to increase the number of merchant ships

:hat would be available for all purposes,  including transatlantic

einforcement for which there is still a shortage of vessels despite

an improvement in numbers in the last year.    A study on NATO&apos;s supply

and demand for merchant shipping in crisis and war,  initiated by a

British proposal,  is well under way.



Essay: The Reserves



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



1. The Reserves are an integral part of the forces that would be

called out in time of emergency;  they are not a follow-up force

separate from the Regular Services.    The Volunteer Reserves -

part-time Servicemen - are generally organised in formed units like

their Regular counterparts.    Each Service can also call on

ex-Regulars,  who retain useful military skills,  including many with a

liability for Reserve Service.    In particular,  Individual Reservists

from a large manpower pool would bring Regular and Territorial Army

(TA)  units up to their wartime strength or replace battle casualties;

the other Services,  whose combat requirements are different,   rely less

on ex-Regulars.



2. All Reservists would play a vital part in defending the European

mainland and the United Kingdom.    The ex-Regular would in most cases

return to the specialty he had as a Regular.    The Volunteer would have

specific roles for which he trains in peacetime.    These roles vary

widely:



The Royal Naval Reserve provides much of the Royal Navy&apos;s

wartime mine counter-measures forces,  manning 11 of the

River class fleet minesweepers as well as 30 ships that

would be taken up for the same  role.    It would also provide

personnel for naval control of reinforcement and resupply

shipping,  as well as medical and dental teams and aircrew.

The members of the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service would help

to defend British ports and anchorages.    Most of the Royal

Marines Reserve would enhance 3 Commando Brigade Royal

Marines in defending NATO&apos;s Northern Flank in North Norway

(see page  []).    The rest would help to defend the United

Kingdom.



The TA (including reinforcements from ex-Regulars) is

planned to provide 58,000 men in formed units as an integral

part of the reinforcement of BAOR, making up more than half

of the infantry,  logistic support and medical support. A

further 29,000 TA soldiers  (including the Home Service

Force) and some 45,000 ex-Regulars would have home defence

roles,  guarding installations, undertaking reconnaissance

and providing communications.



The Royal Auxiliary Air Force would provide personnel to

augment operations,  intelligence and communications staff in

Maritime Headquarters Units and to undertake defence of

front-line airfields.    Other roles would include

responsibility for air movements,  aeromedical evacuation and

guarding of key points.    The RAF Volunteer Reserve would

reinforce Regular units in intelligence, photographic

interpretation,  interrogation and public relations duties,

both at home and on the Continent.



3. The ability of the Reserves to carry out these vital roles is

tested each year in exercises with the Regular Services,  some of which

are described in paragraphs 304-306.



4. Since many of these tasks would put Reservists in the front line

alongside Regular Servicemen,  they have to be just as efficient and

professional.    Training is as varied as the jobs to be done, but for

most Volunteers it entails sessions at training centres in the



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



:venings and at weekends;  all have a two-week period of continuous

;raining each year,  sometimes overseas.    The qualities such training

fosters go beyond military efficiency; Volunteers must have

;elf-discipline,  commitment and perseverance,  an orderly approach to

work, and technical skills.    Officers and NCOs gain leadership,

management and communication skills.    Such qualities are valuable to

the Volunteer in his civilian life,  and benefit his employer as well.



5. Membership of the Volunteer Reserves makes demands not only on

the time of the individuals but also on their families and employers,

?ie believe that the necessary support for their activities is more

Likely to be forthcoming if the public is aware of the central

importance of the Reserves to the defence of NATO.    We have therefore

launched a major campaign,  sponsored by the National Employers Liaison

Committee,  to inform the public of the contribution the Reserves make

to national security,  and to persuade employers that the time needed

for Reserve training is a good investment.



6. We are taking other steps to try to keep people in the Reserves:

we hope to improve the  retention of Reserve officers, which will lead

to better training and stimulate interest and enthusiasm; we are

improving accommodation - 36 of 46 new or rebuilt TA centres required

   expansion plans are now complete,  and improvements are also being

made for the other Services;  and we have taken steps to ensure that

Reservists receive adequate remuneration.    The pay of the Reservist is

kept in step with that of his Regular counterpart, and 1988 saw large

rises in annual training bounty payments for Volunteer Reservists; for

those who have served for at least three years the bounty has risen by

over 30% to  600.



7. All these efforts are designed to make the Volunteer Reserves

more effective,  so that they can fulfil the essential part that they

play in our defence.    For the Volunteers themselves there are the



1 ?rewards of training for a  range of challenging  roles,   the comradeship

fof belonging to a close-knit unit,  and the satisfaction that comes

?from serving alongside the Regular Services in a necessary and

!worthwhile job.    The nation is indebted to them for their efforts;

:without them the Regular Services could not be fully effective in war.

EQUIPPING THE ARMED FORCES



401.  The budget  for equipment  for  the Services  in 1989-90  is  8,258

million.    This is 41% of the total defence budget,  and  1,024 million

more in real terms than was spent in 1978-79.    About 75% of the

equipment budget is spent directly in this country;  another 15%

benefits British industry working on collaborative projects. The

remaining 10% is spent abroad.

omestic Procurement



02. Our procurement policies,  outlined in last year&apos;s Statement, aim

0 obtain for the Armed Forces the equipment they need, when they need

t and with the best value for our money.    Competition is at the heart

f our strategy and it can only succeed if as many companies as

)ossible know about,  and compete for,  our business.    We have taken

teps to inform industry of the opportunities for defence work and at

he end of 1988 there were 9,650 companies on the Defence Contractors

list;  some 700 are added each year.    Two developments deserve

!articular mention:



The New Suppliers&apos;  Service  (NSS) has been set up to develop

the work of the Small Firms Advice Division.    It advises

potential suppliers of all sizes on openings in the defence

market;  a Small Firms Group within the NSS advises smaller

fi rms.



A fourth,  much expanded,  edition of the booklet Selling to

the MOD has been published.



403. Our competitive approach is cutting costs,  but we continue to

press for taut contracts.    We aim for terms that give contractors the

greatest possible incentive to perform efficiently and deliver on time

and to cost.    We prefer firm price contracts  (where the contract price

is what the contractor is paid);  but where this is not possible we

negotiate what we term fixed price contracts,  in which an allowance

for inflation is made.    Where the work needed is less clear, we use

target cost or other incentive arrangements within an overall maximum

price.    Under such contracts efficient contractors can get better

returns,  but those who are inefficient have to fund part or all of any

cost overrun themselves.



404. By adopting a commercial approach to procurement and exposing the

defence industry to market forces, we have encouraged an enterprising

industrial base that actively seeks new ideas and efficiency in the

use of resources.    The rising competitiveness of the British defence

industry has played an important part in its recent export successes

(see paragraph 416).



Box:  Project Management



cor



1.      In last year&apos;s Statement, we outlined our commercial approach to^^he

procurement.    The project manager is vital to that approach.    His roll

is to organise and motivate his team so that projects are clearly

planned,  efficiently run,  and carefully monitored and assessed to

ensure that the equipment meets the operational  requirement and gives

the best value for money; we are therefore determined that project

managers should be properly trained and given the necessary authority

Each project manager&apos;s responsibility and authority will be clearly

defined,  and he will be encouraged to trade off performance, time,

cost and risk, within limits,  in order to achieve value for money.

Project managers will also place more emphasis on improving

reliability and maintainability (see paragraphs 405-406)  to minimise

equipment life-cycle costs.

2.      In response to the recent report Learning From Experience, which

identified best practice in project management and ways of building

this, we are taking the following action:



-        Career management for project managers: more attention is

now paid to their selection,  training, posting and grading.

Potential project managers are being identified and their

training designed for the competitive environment in which

they work.    We also intend that they should spend more time

in each post.



Technical aspects of project management:  a greater

proportion of the development cost will normally be spent

before Full Development begins,  to cut technical risk.



Management organisation of the PE: we intend to cut the

management levels between the managers of major projects and

the Chief of Defence Procurement,  to permit more delegation

of authority and accountability.    Better use of information

technology (see paragraph 510) will aid this process.



Rel iability and Maintainability



1m    405. We  spend a great deal  on spares,   some of which we believe could



fce saved through improved reliability and maintainability (R&amp;M). The

     more  reliable and easily maintained equipment  is,   the more economic it

fes to run and the more use we can make of it.    We thus obtain greater

operational availability as well as better value for money.    It may be

.jje   worth paying more to buy an equipment if it includes features that

?:educe or simplify later repair and maintenance needs,  and thus its

mife-cycle costs,  enough to justify the higher initial cost.



 



.      406. In recent years, we have tested various ways of improving R&amp;M,

fcuch as contracts requiring warranties, or demonstrations of

!compliance with our R&amp;M specifications.    We are to appoint a new

!Director of Reliability to be a focal point within the Department for

ftefining,  developing and monitoring R&amp;M policies.    We are now pursuing



:0    tne recommendations of a study by consultants into ways to make

Spares Price Labelling



We have introduced a range of measures to make our spares

)rocurement more efficient,  including improvements in the size and

frequency of batches to maximise economies in ordering, increasing

opportunities for competition at sub-contract level, seeking

competition for the supply of spares by firms other than the original

nanufacturer and requiring spares to be labelled with their prices.



&apos;      Spares price labelling is an important initiative in defence

:purchasing.    Since July 1987, our contracts for the supply of

equipment spares have required the packages to be labelled with the

aware of the cost of spares,  which encourages more careful use of

Iquipment;  but,  more  importantly,  our users can assess prices and use

their own experience  to judge whether  they give value  for money.



1.      We encourage our users to challenge prices if they seem too high

and welcome suggestions for new or previously unexplored ways to

obtain better value  in spares purchasing.    Price labels also deter

rmaments Cooperation



07. Collaboration with our allies has many benefits.  It reduces for

ach partner the risks and costs of development, introduces

tandardisation and interoperability,  and demonstrates political

ohesion and goodwill.    But it is not an end in itself.    We must

ontinue to apply competition, with its attendant rewards, to

ollaborative as well as national procurement to get the best value

or money.    This is reflected in our contribution to the work of the

ndependent European Programme Group (IEPG),  and NATO&apos;s Conference of

ational Armaments Directors (CNAD).



408. On 1 January,  the United Kingdom succeeded Spain in the chair of

Ihe IEPG.    The main task of our two-year term will be to take forward

the action plan approved by Ministers last November to open the

European defence market up to competition.    The main aims in 1989 are

lor nations to begin publishing regular bulletins of national contract

opportunities and to name focal points with which potential suppliers

can register interest.    Having done this ourselves for the past three

fears,  and with over a year&apos;s experience of the Anglo-French

arrangements described in paragraph 411,  we are sure that these steps

will benefit all the IEPG nations.    We will also work for a more

Coordinated approach to cooperation in research through a European

technology Programme and will seek progress in the IEPG&apos;s efforts to

harmonise operational  requirements and timescales.



409. At our instigation,  the CNAD is addressing strategies to maximise

competition at all levels in collaborative projects;  it has also begun

the trial of a Conventional Armaments Planning System,  aimed at

identifying potential cooperative opportunities at an early stage.

contract opportunities in bulletins available in both countries, and

companies tendering for  requirements in either country are assured of

equal consideration for production contracts valued between  1 million

and  50 million,  and for development contracts valued between  1

million and  10 million.



The Single Market



412. We are considering the implications for defence of the completion

of the internal market by the end of 1992.    Although Community

competence in matters relating to military equipment is circumscribed

by Article 223 of the Treaty of Rome, most of our suppliers also

operate in the civil market and will therefore wish to structure

themselves for the changed environment.    The initiatives described in

paragraphs 408 and 411 above will also stimulate a more international

approach to procurement.    We welcome the opportunities created by the

prospect of these more open markets;  they will help our search for

better value for money.



DEFENCE RESEARCH



413. We plan to spend  428 million on defence research in 1989-90;

this is about 2% of the defence budget and some 5% of planned

procurement spending.    As outlined in previous Statements,  it is our

aim gradually to reduce spending on Government-funded defence research

and development while recognising that there must be enough activity

in this area for our defence needs.    We encourage firms to offer

technologies they have developed themselves,  and we will pursue

collaborative opportunities vigorously.



Box:  The Defence Research Agency



1. There are six defence non-nuclear research establishments - the

Admiralty Research Establishment (ARE), the Royal Armament Research

and Development Establishment (RARDE),  the Royal Aerospace

Establishment (RAE) ,  the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE)!

the Chemical Defence Establishment (CDE) and the Aeroplane and

Armament Experimental Establishment  (A&amp;AEE).    They provide a

scientific and technical service,  spanning the whole of the equipment 4

procurement process,  to support the Department&apos;s role as an t

intelligent customer for defence equipment.    They employ some 14,000

staff, many of them highly skilled, and have capital facilities such



as ship tanks and wind tunnels. e



2. Under the Next Steps philosophy,  those parts of Government that T



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



1 deliver a service should be  run in the way most suited to the special



(r features of their business;  and we  intend that most of the



1 establishments will become an Executive Agency.    There  is no blueprint



or. for Agency status.



3. Four establishments would form the core of the Agency: ARE,

RARDE,  RAE and RSRE.    We are studying whether other research-related

parts of the Ministry should be included.    Our aim is to get best

value for money in spending on research and technical support for

projects by strengthening the establishments&apos;  internal management and

by sharpening the relationship between the Department as customer and



 r   the establishments as suppliers of advice and technical services.



4. At the same time,  we will preserve important existing aspects of

;     the establishments&apos;  work - their part in international research



collaboration and information exchange,  their relationship with

industry,  and the programme of staff exchanges with the Department.



Ln    5.      Detailed planning is now under way,  including the appointment of



a Chief Executive  (Designate)  to head the new organisation and to draw

*     up its forward plans in response to our requirements.    There will be

le    full consultation with trades unions.    Final decisions to proceed and

on the Agency&apos;s status will be taken in the light of this further

work, with the aim of establishing the Agency in the spring of 1991.



114. There were several notable achievements at the defence research

establishments in 1988:



The Royal Aerospace Establishment (RAE),  formerly the Royal

Aircraft Establishment but renamed in April 1988 to reflect

its role in aerospace technology, won two Queen&apos;s Awards for

Technological Achievement:  the first, won with British Alcan

and Alcan International, was for work on aluminium lithium

alloys that will greatly cut the weight of airframes; the

second was for work with British Aerospace on the design of

the wing for the A320 Airbus aircraft.



Research at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE)

into carbon dioxide laser technology has helped British

industry to win contracts to supply systems for overseas and

multi-national projects.



fit 415. We have made progress in linking the work of the establishments

to the needs of the wider economy.    The Civil  Industrial Access



  Scheme, designed to encourage civil industry to make more use of the

*expertise of the establishments,  is now in operation; and Defence



t     Technology Enterprises Ltd has arranged 44 licences and signed options



CONFIDENTIAL

DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



with companies to use our technology.    We expect this to lead to at

least  45 million worth of sales over the next six years.    Among many

examples,   research by the establishments in laser-based sensors has

been regarded as having great commercial potential;  four licences have 1r

been granted in different fields of application and many others are

under discussion.



DEFENCE EXPORTS



416. Our competitive approach towards buying equipment for our own

Services is helping British industry towards many export successes,

the most notable of 1988 being the second phase of the al-Yamamah

project to supply aircraft and other equipment to Saudi Arabia. New

contracts signed in 1988 are expected to be worth some  3,500 million,

and the United Kingdom is now the world&apos;s third largest defence

exporter.    This makes a large contribution both to employment and to

the balance of payments.



417. Export success depends primarily on the efforts of industry, but

the Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO)  plays an important

role in support.    Besides coordinating Government support for major

sales,  it provides market surveys,  analyses the potential market for

new products, and ensures that our specifications for new equipment

take account of export potential.    It also stages exhibitions such as

the British Army Equipment Exhibition at Aldershot, which in 1988

attracted visitors from 84 countries,  and is closely concerned with

the Farnborough Air Show,  organised by the Society of British

Aerospace Companies.    The reputation of the Services, and overseas

deployments  (such as those described on page []) which display British

equipment to international audiences,  also contribute to export

success.



418. This success does not imply any relaxation of the strict controls

needed to prevent weapons or other sensitive equipment falling into

the wrong hands.    The DESO cooperates closely with other Government

Departments to ensure that an informed view is taken of the balance

between the legitimate pursuit of commercial interests and the

necessary application of Government controls.

419. The new US Administration has confirmed that the SDI research

programme will  continue;  we continue  to support the programme and

British industry&apos;s  involvement  in it.    The US/UK SDI technical

information exchange is developing well,  and now includes industrial

experts as well as specialist Government staffs.    By February, some

90 US-funded SDI contracts and sub-contracts, worth some $65 million,

had been placed in the United Kingdom.    An important award was made to

the Culham Laboratory for work on technology for a ground-based

neutral particle beam demonstrator project;  if it goes through to

completion,  Culham&apos;s share will be substantial.



420. In the 1987 Statement  (paragraph 526) we  reported on the European

Architecture Study.    The original programme of work was completed in

May 1988.    A two-phase extension,  on the implications of the INF

Treaty for theatre missile defence architecture, will be completed in

the summer.



Essay:  Competition in Defence Services



1.      In pursuit of efficiency and value for money, we seek to ensure

that defence support functions are carried out by the private sector

unless it is operationally necessary, or more cost-effective,  to keep

the work in-house. This:



improves efficiency and saves money without affecting

standards of service;



allows Service manpower to be redeployed to front line

tasks;



encourages competition; and



frees Departmental managers to concentrate on their

essential business.



The Services have been placing contracts for supplies and

services for centuries,  but the policy has been given more impetus in

jlecent years;  since 1979,  contracting out defence services has made

net savings that now run at some  50 million a year.    In 1987-88 alone

we extended market testing to more than  20 million worth of support

tasks.



3.      Large savings have been made in areas such as cleaning, catering,

grounds maintenance and security guarding.    But contractors also

manage many other support activities for the Services.    The biggest

single example is the introduction of commercial management to the

Royal Dockyards,  described in previous Statements.    We have also

promoted and developed the concept of facilities management, under

which the contractor takes on a range of technical and managerial

 ctivities at a site.    Examples include the Ballistic Missile Early



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



Warning System at RAF Fylingdales, several major stores depots, and 11

weapons testing ranges and Proof and Experimental Establishments.



4. The Royal Navy uses contractors&apos;  aircraft,  aircrew and

maintenance personnel  in target simulation and electronic warfare

training,  and has contracted out many aircraft maintenance tasks. The

RAF has contracted out engineering and supply functions at a number of

stations,  including Linton-on-Ouse,  Shawbury and Church Fenton. The

Army is exposing support services to competition in its Ordnance

Depots,   ranges and training areas,  and has contracted out academic and

support functions at the Royal Military College of Science at

Shrivenham.    Procurement Executive activities that have been put to

contract include range support,  the operation of electro-magnetic

pulse simulators and automotive laboratory work.    In all,  some 120

activities,  from bird control and balloon flying to weapon engineering

and maintenance,  have been let to contract by the Department.



5. Before letting an activity to contract, we must satisfy ourselves

on a number of points.    First,  and most important,  is that moving a

task to the private sector does not affect the Services&apos; operational

capability.    In the past,  contractors have given good service in

wartime,  and there is no reason to think that they would not do so in

the future.    But safeguards are necessary.    Each of the Services has

negotiated arrangements with contractors for use on mobilisation, and

recent contracts have specified,  so far as possible, contractors&apos;

obligations in war and transition to war.    Operational factors are

given full weight in deciding whether to expose an area to

competition.    Decisions on whether to proceed are not taken centrally

but by the management areas of the Service Departments.



6. Another factor is morale, both civilian and Service.    Testing the

market inevitably causes uncertainty,  disruption and extra work.

There has been a perception that the process has been driven solely by

the need to cut manpower.    This is not the case;  the aim is to get

value for money.    Staff have a say in the process and can influence

its outcome,  and the impact on Service personnel is taken fully into

account.    Trades unions are consulted at all stages.    Candidate areas

are examined for efficiency savings before the competition is run; the

resulting &quot;in-house bid&quot;  forms the basis for comparison with tenders

from the private sector.



7. A further concern is that standards are maintained. Contractors

need to maintain quality of service, which depends on high morale and

staff stability, while making savings.    Their approach has been to

increase efficiency by instituting more flexible terms and conditions

and by using the clean break provided by the competitive process to

make better use of the workforce,  while generally keeping salaries at

a level that encourages a high standard of service.    Contractors do

not have to re-employ existing staff but many are indeed re-employed.



8. To ensure that standards are maintained we have issued guidance

on best practice.    This stresses these crucial steps:



the drawing up at the outset of a comprehensive statement 0:

requirements on which the competition is to be based - the

importance of this cannot be exaggerated;



if a contract is awarded,  a clear definition of the channel

of communication between contractor and customer;



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT

regular and thorough monitoring of  the contractors&apos;

performance,  or that of the in-house operation if it wins

the competition; and



re-tendering at appropriate intervals.



I.     Using our previous experience, we are extending market testing.



ometimes we decide not to proceed,  either before the tender stage, or

ifter it if keeping the service in-house is the most cost-effective

iption.    But competition is the stimulus;  bids from tenderers are



lways sought in good faith, with the assurance that value for money



s the yardstick, and where there is a reasonable expectation that the

irivate sector will be competitive.    Even where the task remains



 -house we have seen savings of between 20% and 30%,  in line with

(xperience elsewhere.



0.    Competition in the support area is a valuable adjunct to, and

xtension of,  the management reforms being put in place through the



lew Management Strategy and our response to Next Steps, which are



described in Chapter 5.

RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT

THE DEFENCE BUDGET



B01.  The defence budget  for  1989-90  is  20,143 million.    This  is  928

million more than the original Supply Estimates provision for 1988-89,

and  175 million more than was planned for 1989-90 in the 1988 Public

Expenditure White Paper  (Cm 288).    The planned provision for 1990-91

is, at  21,190 million,   610 million more than that in the 1988 Public

Expenditure White Paper.    Provision for 1991-92 has been set at

 22,100 million.



502. Figure 4 shows a breakdown of the defence budget by main areas of

expenditure, while Figure 5 analyses defence spending by main

programmes.    Figure 6 depicts the costs of our major commitments, and

Figure 7 shows that British defence spending continues to set a good

example in NATO,  both in terms of its share of national wealth and in

absolute terms.



503. In last year&apos;s Statement we said that the defence budget was

planned to hold broadly level in real terms between 1988-89 and

1990-91.    The further cash rises reflected in the 1989 Public

Expenditure White Paper  (Cm 601) mean that,  on current inflation



forecasts,  the defence budget will grow in real terms between 1988-89

estimated outturn and 1991-92.    The cash increases over previous plans

are the biggest for any three-year period since the first cash

planning Survey in 1981,  Falklands additions aside.    They do not imply

 ny change in direction in defence policy.    Their purpose is to

sustain programmes with proper funding and to enable the United

Kingdom to continue to play its full part as one of the leading

members of NATO.    They take full account of plans to improve

efficiency (described in paragraphs 507-511).    The resulting budgetary

plans provide a firm framework for the next three years; this brings

!valuable certainty and confidence to our forward planning.    And it

,pisposes of talk of the need for a defence review.



!504. The increases have not removed the need for decisions to be made

 &gt;etween priorities.    The central instrument for determining the size

5pnd shape of the defence programme and priorities within it remains

the Long-Term Costing  (LTC).    Each year this exercise recosts the :igu

entire defence programme in the light of up-to-date information. The

LTC looks ten years ahead,  and allows us to consider adjustments

needed to match changes to expected resources or to respond to other

developments.



505. Highly effective procedures have been developed for the LTC.

Early each year programme assumptions,   reflecting current defence

policy,  are issued for costing;  alternative assumptions,  dealing with

possible changes to the programme,  are also issued.    After careful

scrutiny,  the projected cost of the programme is compared with the

level of resources for future years indicated by the Public

Expenditure Survey.    Adjustments are then considered and arranged in

priority order,  to assist final decision-making.    The finalised

costing forms the starting point for the next LTC.    The LTC provides a

planning framework for the Department,  but individual projects or

spending proposals must still obtain specific approval;  finding a

place in the LTC in no way assures this.

MANAGEMENT EFFICIENCY



506. 1989 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the creation of an

expanded Ministry of Defence.    In 1964 the three Service Departments ?

were unified with the existing Ministry of Defence, which had

previously had a coordinating role,  to achieve a better balance of

political and military advice in the formulation of defence policy and

planning, and to improve the management of defence resources. The

unification in 1971 of the separate Service procurement organisations

as the Procurement Executive completed this process.    Since then there

have been reorganisations of Ministerial responsibilities (in 1981)

and of the central organisation for defence (in 1985), and we continue

to review our efficiency.

07.  In the  1990s the New Management Strategy,  discussed in the essay

  page  [], will set the pattern for better departmental management,

e shall also improve performance in the shorter term; we have set

urselves an internal target over three years for a cumulative

mprovement in efficiency,  either by achieving the same output from

ess resources or by increasing output,  of 25%? per year. This

*xercise began on 1 April 1988,  and covers almost two-thirds of the

efence budget,  that is over  12 billion annually. Central

oordination of the exercise will enable a better linkage to be made

etween the resources released by greater efficiency and the resulting

Icope for funding programmes.    Other initiatives  (described in Chapter

4) exist to improve value for money in capital equipment expenditure.



508. Service manpower plans are reviewed annually.    Especial emphasis

is placed on improving efficiency in the support area and transferring

Resources to the front line.    Civilians are replacing Service

personnel in support functions where this is operationally sensible

and saves money.    We have thus achieved improvements in fighting

ability without a commensurate rise in Service manpower.



509. We have greatly improved the cost-effectiveness of our use of

civilian manpower.    Since 1979,  the number of UK-based civilians has

 alien by 43%,  from 248,000 to 142,000.    This has been achieved

through a combination of efficiency measures, rationalisation,

privatisation and contracting out  (discussed in the essay on page []);

this drive continues.



$10. Proper use of information technology (IT)  is crucial to our

efficiency initiatives and to management in general.    After a thorough

feview of current practice,  measures are being introduced to improve

*he planning and delivery of IT systems and services.    This will

insure that IT systems are better able to support management

priorities and are more interoperable;  common technical standards will

be introduced;  and more effective use will be made of manpower working

|n it.



111. We are paying close attention to the relocation of functions away

from high cost areas in London and the South East.    The 1979 dispersal

programme,  transferring 1,400 jobs to Glasgow,  was completed in March

this year with the move of the last 70 posts;  over a thousand of these

jobs have been filled locally.    Such moves must,  of course, be

justified both operationally and financially,  and will not happen

until we have consulted widely.    We announced in March that we are

consulting the trades unions about a proposal to move about 1,500 jobs

in the Directorate General of Defence Quality Assurance from Woolwich

and Bromley to Stockton-on-Tees.    We are also looking at other

possible relocations:  detailed studies into relocating both the Land

and Air Systems Controllerates, which would involve over 3,000 jobs,

are in hand;  several smaller moves are also planned or under way,

mostly from London,  and some 1,200 jobs will be transferred over the

next two years;  and outside London,  preliminary studies have been

carried out into the possibility of collocating Sea Systems

Controllerate project staffs;  they indicate that collocation is both

practicable and cost-effective.    Additional work to confirm this is

now in hand,  and a final decision on the best way ahead will be taken

in the light of this further work.



The Next Steps



512. The New Management Strategy will lay the essential foundations

for implementing the Next Steps reforms in defence.  In the meantime,

we have been examining those of our activities that, as largely

self-contained executive operations, might benefit from Agency status,

Last year&apos;s Statement referred to the studies on the non-nuclear

research establishments (the position on which is outlined on page []i

and the Meteorological Office, where work continues with the aim of

achieving Agency status from April 1990; we will seek to delegate the

fullest possible responsibility for the day-to-day running of the

Office to a Chief Executive,  subject to efficiency and performance

targets set by the Department.    We are also studying other areas to

assess their suitability for Agency status.



PERSONNEL

The Services



513. The quality of Service personnel remains excellent; but

recruiting was more difficult in 1988-89 than in earlier years,

reflecting lower numbers of young people and more competition from

other employers.    Retaining trained manpower has also been more



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



ifficult.    The proportion of personnel electing to leave at voluntary

:&gt;reak points  rose  in the year,  as did the proportion of those applying

for premature voluntary release  (PVR).    The annual  rate of PVR

ipplications for officers at December 1988 was 3.7% of trained

strength;  the proportion that actually left was 3.3%.    At the same

point PVR applications from non-commissioned personnel were running at

an annual  rate of 4.3% of trained strength,  with actual  releases at

3.3%.    The combination of larger outflows and shortfalls in recruiting

is a cause for increasing concern,  especially as the number of young

people entering the employment market is set to fall further.



514. This fall,  the so-called demographic trough,  affects almost all



European countries.    In Britain the number of men in the 16-19 age



range,  from which the Services now draw some 75% of their recruits,



lias fallen by 10% since 1983 ;  by 1994 it will have fallen by 23% from

 



:urrent levels.    And continued economic growth is likely to increase

:ompetition for labour,  especially of highly educated and skilled

)eople.



115. We are  already acting to deal with the problems created by these

:rends.    We are spending more on recruiting publicity and intend to

mprove its effectiveness.    We are seeking more ways to retain trained

ervicemen and are intensifying our research into the reasons why they

eave prematurely.    We shall aim to ensure that terms and conditions

f service remain relevant to modern conditions and that they respond

0 changes in attitudes towards careers in the Services.



16. We shall also continue to look for ways to expand opportunities

or women in the Services.    The Royal Navy has introduced a Special

ntry Scheme for members of the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service to read

ngineering at the Royal Naval Engineering College and is conducting a

omprehensive study on the training and employment of women.    The Army

lso has a major study under way into widening the range of jobs

vailable to women.    The RAF is to increase the number of ground

irwomen from 5,000 to about 7,000 over the next five years and is

tudying ways to broaden the opportunities for the employment of women

s aircrew.



17. We also want more recruits from ethnic minorities.    An initial



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



survey of applicants to the Services by ethnic origin done  in 1987-88

shows that ethnic minorities are substantially under-represented; the

results are shown in Tables 7.1 and 7.2 of Volume 2,  accompanied by an

article on page 62.    We already try to direct our recruiting effort at

all ethnic groups and are considering, with the Commission for Racial

Equality,  what more we can do.    As a first step we have commissioned

consultants to help us to show why so few members of ethnic minorities

join the Services and to identify cost-effective means to improve the

si tuation.



518. Pay and conditions of service play an important part in

recruiting and retaining enough personnel of the right quality. We

accepted in full the recommendations of the Armed Forces Pay Review

Body in 1988 and 1989.    Following a comprehensive review, we have made

major changes to the allowances paid to Service personnel,  to create a

package of benefits more in keeping with Service life in the 1990s.

Among other changes, we have greatly increased financial aid for those

who have to move house and we have removed many of the differences in

the treatment of single and married personnel; at the same time, some

benefits,  less appropriate to modern conditions,  have been or will be

removed to pay for these improvements.    We will evaluate the revised

allowances and make adjustments as appropriate.



Civilians



519. Despite the measures outlined in last year&apos;s Statement, shortages

in certain grades continue;  there are growing shortages in executive

grades, where the needs of the New Management Strategy will bear

heavily,  and in the information technology and management accountancy

fields.    We are also acutely short of administrative and secretarial

grades in London and the South East,  and the problem is spreading.

Shortages of specialists,  especially electronic engineers and computet

scientists,  continue to worry us.



520. Several measures have been taken to deal with this problem,

including:



local pay additions for staff in areas hardest-hit by

problems of recruitment and retention, and particular

consideration of the problems in the London area;



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



for industrial grades,  consideration of measures to relate

pay more closely to the local market;  and the prospect, if

talks on a long-term pay agreement go well,  of a pay

settlement in 1989 to be  &quot;guided&quot; by pay movements in the

private sector;



extra pay for specialists in London and in shortage

disciplines such as electronics,  operational research and

computer sciences;



a new long-term pay agreement for middle management, [and

similar arrangements for executive,  clerical and typing

grades,  including higher pay for staff in London,] and

continuing use of incentive pay arrangements linking the pay

of senior Civil Service grades to their performance;



steps to improve recruitment and development of staff in

their formative years,  including the early promotion of

suitable staff in the executive grades:  this has had good

results in the first year of operation; and



greater flexibility in the use of staff,  to make it easier

for women with children to continue their careers,  to allow

more part-time working,  including job-sharing,  more flexible

working patterns and retirement policy, and the use of

agency staff.



he effects of these measures are being closely monitored.



521. We have a major programme - larger than in any other Government

Department - of staff interchange with industry.    Each year,  more than

200 staff exchanges take place with over 60 companies.    This programme

is one of a range of measures to foster a more commercially-minded

approach among our staff.    We continue to recruit experienced

engineers and scientists direct from industry to fill project

management posts.    We are pioneering the introduction of short-term

contracts for scientists who wish to work in Government for a

specified period before returning to industry.    Some of our senior



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



staff are now non-executive directors of major companies.    And we

continue to provide commercially orientated training,  for example in

negotiating skills,  for our procurement staff.    This diverse approach

to staffing allows us  to  respond more  flexibly to the ever-changing

pressures we face.



THE DEFENCE ESTATE



522. After the announcement in May 1988 of changes in the relationship

between the Property Services Agency  (PSA)  and other Government

Departments,  we have  resumed responsibility for managing the defence

estate.    Bringing together  responsibility and accountability within a

single Department will enable us to manage our estate more efficientl

and cost-effectively.    Moreover we will,  from April 1990,  be untied

from the PSA for the supply of works services,  and will be free to

procure works services commercially, with the PSA as one possible

supplier.    The Permanent Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Defence

will take over from the PSA&apos;s Chief Executive as Accounting Officer

for spending on defence works.



523. The size of the defence estate depends on the needs of the

Services and the Procurement Executive,  but we are determined that it

should be no larger than necessary.    It now covers about 240,000

hectares,  80% of which consists of training areas,  ranges and

operational airfields,  some 12,000 hectares less than in 1979. We

continue to pursue opportunities for further rationalisation and

disposal;  receipts from the sale of land and buildings were over  77

million in 1987-88,  and we expect the 1988-89 total to be about  155

million.    At the same time, we continue to buy land to meet the

growing training needs of the Regular and Territorial Armies and to

accommodate the longer ranges and greater safety areas that modern

weapons demand.    Disposing of surplus married quarters also remains a

high priority,  and we have in the last five years reduced our

stockholding by more than 7,000 to 78,000; we plan to dispose of 3,00

more by next March.    Wherever possible quarters that we do not need

immediately but for which we still have a long-term need are offered

for lease to local authorities or housing associations.



524. We attach great importance to good estate management practices

and to conservation.    Largely because the land has not been developed

or intensively farmed,  the defence estate has several unique habitats,

as well as more than 200 designated Sites of Special Scientific

Jnterest, which are monitored by a network of conservation groups.



ssay: The New Management Strategy



The Government&apos;s Financial Management Initiative  (FMI)  is being

ursued vigorously in the Ministry of Defence.     Following successful

xperiments with Executive Responsibility Budgets  (ERBs),  we have now

ecided on a New Management Strategy designed,   in line with the

principles of the FMI,  to allocate budgets and delegate authority to

anagers,  to set managers demanding targets and to develop better

ystems and techniques for performance measurement,  applying as

ppropriate the best private and public sector management techniques.



Underlying this is the basic principle of the  reorganisation of

he Ministry of Defence in 1985 - strong central  resource allocation

ith delegated authority to manage the resources once allocated. The

ew Management Strategy is geared specifically to providing a

atisfactory framework for the latter purpose.    In this respect the

trategy lays the essential foundations for the Government&apos;s Next

teps reforms, which are encouraging the development in the public

ervice of accountable management by creating executive Agencies - to

ake on as much as possible of the Government&apos;s executive functions,

  this context two specific areas of our activity - the non-nuclear

esearch establishments and the Meteorological Office - have been

dentified as potential Agencies  (see paragraph 512).    But the New

Management Strategy is Department- and Service-wide,  and represents a

 undamental change in the way we do our business.    Hitherto, we have

elied on an input-based financial system controlled from the centre,

e are now seeking to ensure that managers throughout the chain of

:ommand have a much better understanding of cost,  so as to get better

alue for money from our operating costs.



There are three main elements in the New Management Strategy:

irst, a Departmental Plan setting out clearly our programme and

erformance objectives,  linked to the Long-Term Costing (LTC) (see



)aragraphs 504-505)  and subsidiary operating cost management plans;



:econd,  a comprehensive system of budgets throughout the Department

nd the Service Commands;  and third,  a continuing cycle of objective

etting and performance review up and down the management chains. All

hese will be supported by a network of management information systems

hroughout the Department and the Commands.



The New Management Strategy is being introduced in stages. 1

pril 1991 is the target date for full implementation of the budgetary

egime.    There will be four major changes from that date:



Budgets held by accountable individual managers will be

extended to cover all the Department&apos;s operating costs -

that is,  all its spending except that on the Procurement

Executive&apos;s equipment programme.



Those who actually manage activity will also manage the

associated resources,  and there will be a shift from control



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT


DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



of resource inputs towards output-orientated management.



The annual process by which budget holders contract to

achieve tasks will be fully integrated with the LTC.



- The objectives and targets set for individual budget holders

will flow from the Departmental Plan and subsidiary

management plans.



5. Before each financial year starts,  the Defence Secretary will

have approved the previous LTC and a Departmental Plan.    This Plan

will lay down our aims and the strategy to achieve them within the

available resources,  and will include objectives for military

effectiveness and efficiency as well as the basic policy outline for

the next LTC.    Flowing from the Departmental Plan and amplifying it

will be operating cost management plans for the major management

areas,  including each Service;  these will set detailed objectives and

targets for the area as a whole and for its Top Level Budget holders

over the next three years.    In turn the Top Level Budget holders will

develop their own plans from these management plans.



6. There will be some 20 &quot;Top Level Budgets&quot;, held by the

Commanders-in-Chief and the officers and officials in charge of major

management areas of the Department,  including the Principal Personnel

Officers and Principal Administrative Officers of the Services and

senior civilians such as the Second Permanent Under-Secretary. Where

practicable and sensible,  these Top Level Budgets will be broken down

into progressively lower level budgets,  each again held by one person;

the lowest level budget will be the ERB allocated to a unit,  such as a

training establishment or stores depot.    Budget holders will have as

much flexibility.as possible in using their cash in order to achieve

agreed tasks and objectives with maximum efficiency.



7. Top Level Budgets will therefore be used both as a basis for

financial planning in the LTC and to manage resources during the year:



Budget holders will each year plan and recost the activitie

for which they are responsible,  in line with the

Departmental Plan and subsidiary management plans and with

the LTC.    These costings will be scrutinised at each level

up the budgetary chain to the Top Level Budget holder, and

then be considered by the Office of Management and Budget

against overall priorities.    Programmes and tasks will be

agreed,  and resources allotted to each Top Level Budget for

the coming year.



- During the year, each budget holder in the hierarchy will b

expected to keep within his budgetary ceiling,  and to fulfi

his tasks as efficiently as possible.    If a budget holder

cannot manage within his budget,  the next budget holder up

the hierarchy will need to make the necessary adjustments.

If a Top Level Budget holder has difficulty in handling a

forecast overspend,  it will then be for the relevant Servic

Executive Committee or the Procurement Executive Management

Board to ensure that this is accommodated within the total

assigned to all the Top Level Budgets in its area.



8. Underpinning management plans and budgets from year to year will

be an annual cycle of objective setting (flowing from the Departmenta



CONFIDENTIAL



DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



lan,  through the subsidiary management plans to the lowest level) and

erformance review (flowing upwards,  as budget holders account for

heir performance against objectives and targets to successively

,igher levels),    information on performance will also be fed into the

,TC and planning processes.



The New Management Strategy will need much better management

nformation to support it.    At the highest level,  there will be an

nterlocking family of information systems  (which we are calling

OPMIS), which will give a strategic overview of output and spending

gainst objectives,  and will be supported by more detailed systems for

anagement at Top Level Budget holder level and below.    Information on

pending in each budgetary area will come from the Department&apos;s

entral Ledger;  the accounting systems supporting the Ledger are being

odified to allow this.    We are working to define the information

eeded to measure performance and the systems needed to provide it.



0.    In advance of full implementation, we have begun a pilot round of

bjective setting and performance review, and a prototype Departmental

lan has been prepared for 1989-90.    Lessons learnt from the pilot

ound will help in the conduct of a further,  and fuller,  trial round,

HE BALANCE

CONVENTIONAL FORCES



601. Any realistic security policy must take full account of the

forces and capabilities actually deployed by the Warsaw Pact.



efinitive judgments about the balance are difficult to make, because

a large number of unquantifiable factors contribute to it (as

explained in the essay &quot;The Conventional Balance&quot; in last year&apos;s

Statement).    But the prime fact for European security remains that the



arsaw Pact retains a large and undeniable numerical superiority in

land and air forces in Europe.

Current Disposition of Forces - Atlantic to Urals - last year&apos;s Figure

The numerical balance



602. Figure 8 shows land and air forces now in place from the Atlantic

to the Urals.    In this area,  the Warsaw Pact now has at least three

times as many tanks and artillery pieces as NATO,  and a fivefold

advantage in Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicles  (AIFVs). This

advantage in land-based systems with a capability to seize and hold

territory is supported by a formidable logistics capability, outlined

on page [].    In the Central Region - that is,  the Benelux countries

and the Federal Republic,  and Poland,  Czechoslovakia,  and the German

Democratic Republic - where the  risk of surprise attack and large

scale offensive action is greatest,  the Warsaw Pact has twice as many

tanks, artillery pieces and combat aircraft as NATO (as shown in

Figure 9 ) .

the current Soviet plan to fight a fast-moving offensive

battle .



Over the last twenty years,  the Soviet Union has built up its

onventional forces to make them capable of operating over a prolonged

jeriod.    Even though the forecast demand for munitions,  fuel and other

terns has grown,  the ability of the Soviet and Warsaw Pact logistic

rganisation to support sustained operations has been greatly improved

1y reorganising supply transport units,  streamlining supply procedures

nd introducing larger cargo vehicles.    Forward-based war stocks in

Eastern Europe should be enough to support a major offensive for at

east two weeks.    Warsaw Pact ammunition stocks in Central Europe

oubled between 1970 and 1984,  and there is enough fuel stored forward

  avoid any constraints on operations.    The present infrastructure

ould meet the demands of high intensity war for about two months,

hereafter,  an extended conventional offensive could only be supported

y wartime production levels in Soviet industry.



Soviet military practice ensures that enough trained manpower is

  hand to replace casualties,  although the forces following the first

ine of attack would be composed largely of reservists.    How effective

hese were would depend on how much training they had received after

obilisation.    But with some nine million ex-conscripts available

lose service would have finished in the last five years, operating

eserve equipment of familiar types,  this problem would be small.



Although the Soviet logistics system still has some weaknesses,

t has, as compared with NATO,  the fundamental advantage that forward

orces are linked to their main arsenal by short overland routes, not

ong transatlantic ones.    Soviet forces in Eastern Europe are,  in any

:ase, largely self-sufficient.    We have no evidence of any cut-backs

  military stockpiles,  despite the public emphasis on &quot;reasonable

sufficiency&quot;.    The logistic capability of the Warsaw Pact, which far

;urpasses that of NATO,  is crucial to its continuing ability to wage a

iustained and large-scale offensive with the minimum of warning.



03. The announcement by the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact

ountries of unilateral cuts in forces and the withdrawal or



lisbandment of some armoured and other offensively oriented units in

astern Europe over the next two years shows a welcome recognition

hat there is a substantial conventional imbalance in Europe.    As part



if these cuts, the Soviet Union intends to reduce its forces by 10,000

anks,  8,500 artillery systems and 800 combat aircraft in the area



)etween the Atlantic and the Urals, as well as reducing by 500,000 the

otal strength of the Soviet armed forces.    The cuts announced by



)ther Warsaw Pact countries complement those of the Soviet Union, but



&gt;n a far smaller scale.



604. Certain types of offensive forces - tanks and river crossing

forces for example - are among those to be withdrawn from Eastern

Europe,  together with some short-range nuclear weapons  (see paragraph

620).    Mr Gorbachev has also indicated that the remaining forces will

be further  restructured to become  &quot;clearly defensive&quot;.    We welcome the

recognition that Soviet forces,  unlike those of NATO,  are not

currently defensively orientated;  but we must wait and see whether the385

measures taken will bring about the genuinely defensive force

structure based on &quot;reasonable sufficiency&quot; promised by Mr Gorbachev, 75|



L



r



605. The proposed cuts will,  in any case,  still leave a large Warsaw 120

Pact conventional superiority in Europe;  and we have yet to see any

slowing down in the rate of procurement and modernisation of Warsaw 300!

Pact equipment.    For instance,  the Soviet army alone acquired more

than 3,000 of the latest types of tank in 1988.    Even after these cuts

have been implemented,  the Warsaw Pact will continue to enjoy a

massive numerical superiority in conventional land and air forces

example,  some 2.4:1  in tanks and artillery,  and 1.8:1 in combat

aircraft).

606. Naval forces can be deployed anywhere in the world, which makes 3E |u

it difficult to assign particular ships to any one region. Figure 10 4ln iuc

shows the principal naval fotces of NATO and the Warsaw Pact normally eari r&lt;

located or based in the North Atlantic and the seas bordering Europe. 5&apos;ndud

Since assured use of sea communications is vital to NATO, we must

assume that in war the Warsaw Pact would try to deny that use. NATO

has never concealed that it has more major surface vessels than the

Warsaw Pact. This reflects our need, in time of war, to protect

sea-borne reinforcements in the Atlantic and other seas. The Warsaw

Pact has a superiority in nuclear-powered attack submarines, posing a

real threat to NATO shipping in the Eastern Atlantic.



(Figure 10 - NATO and Warsaw Pact Principal Naval Forces)



607. Progress in arms control clearly depends on detailed and

verifiable information on the forces in question;  the Warsaw Pact&apos;s

refusal to discuss data issues seriously was a major barrier to

agreement in the MBFR talks (see paragraph 203).    As a practical

initiative to encourage greater openness, NATO published in November

1988 its assessment of the land-based forces of both West and East in

the area from the Atlantic to the Urals (&quot;Conventional Forces in

Europe: The Facts&quot;).    This information was not a substitute for the

ata needed for negotiations, but showed the imbalances in forces that

hey must address.



08. In January 1989 the Warsaw Pact responded by publishing,  for the

irst time,  detailed figures on its own armed forces in Europe and its

issessment of the balance in the European area.    This confirmed NATO&apos;s

concerns about the Warsaw Pact&apos;s very large superiority in land forces

ind equipment  (in the case of Warsaw Pact tanks,  their figure was even

ligher than NATO&apos;s previous estimates).    Moreover,  although inaccurate

&apos;igures and debatable counting rules were used to claim NATO

superiority in some areas and to narrow the Warsaw Pact&apos;s lead in

Ithers (for example,  the United Kingdom was credited with almost twice

as many tanks as we actually have),  the data still does not support

the Warsaw Pact&apos;s contention that there is a so-called &quot;rough parity&quot;

or anything like it  (as shown in Figure 11).    We nonetheless see the

Warsaw Pact&apos;s statement as a useful first step towards the greater

iegree of openness about data necessary if the negotiations on

:onventional Armed Forces in Europe are to lead to a worthwhile and

rerifiable arms control agreement.



(Figure 11 - Comparison of NATO and Warsaw Pact published

lodernisation of Forces: The Qualitative Balance



09. It is sometimes argued that the Warsaw Pact&apos;s massive numerical

uperiority in military equipment is offset by NATO&apos;s qualitative

ead.    NATO countries have continued to deploy a number of advanced

eapon systems including modern main battle tanks,  such as Ml, Leopard



and Challenger,  a new generation of AIFVs,  including the Bradley M2

nd the British Warrior,  and various advanced fighter aircraft, such

s the F-15,  the F-16,  the Tornado and Mirage 2000.    But in several

reas the quality of modern Warsaw Pact equipment is comparable or

even superior to that of the corresponding NATO systems.



it



610. All modern tanks are more powerful than older ones, being

protected by advanced armours and generally having larger calibre

guns, more lethal ammunition,  more sophisticated fire control systems

 nd better mobility.    Overall, modern Warsaw Pact tanks  (the T-64,

T-72 and T-80 introduced in the late 1960s,  early 1970s and late 1970s

!respectively) are as good as modern NATO ones.    More and more Warsaw

Pact tanks are being fitted with explosive  reactive armour, which

gives them much greater protection against anti-tank guided weapons

than their NATO counterparts;  and,  unlike any NATO tanks,  the T-64B

and T-80 can fire anti-tank guided missiles through their guns. The

Warsaw Pact continues to develop and deploy new highly capable models

for example,  a successor to the T-72 tank has  recently entered

production in the Soviet Union.



611. The Warsaw Pact&apos;s numerical superiority in older tanks may be

partly offset by the superior firepower of their Western equivalents.

But the modernisation of older Warsaw Pact tanks is reducing this

qualitative advantage.    Moreover,  the Warsaw Pact has more modern

tanks than NATO&apos;s entire tank fleet,  old or new.



612. To operate effectively,  the tank needs infantry and artillery

support.    AIFVs have enhanced battlefield mobility and firepower. In

terms of quality,  there is little to choose between NATO and Warsaw

Pact AIFVs.    Both the US Bradley M2 and the Warsaw Pact BMP-2, for

example,  are well protected,  very mobile and are armed with a fully

stabilised cannon and an anti-tank guided missile.    In recent years

both sides have improved their artillery systems: weapons have been

modernised;  self-propelled guns have been widely deployed;  the range

and lethality of ammunition have grown; and target-acquisition and

command and control systems have improved.    The Warsaw Pact, by

usually being the first to field improvements and by producing

purpose-built guns for all levels of command,  now has artillery that

generally outranges its NATO counterparts,  has faster rates of fire,

and has more lethal ammunition.    The Soviet Union also has an

undisputed lead in multiple rocket launcher technology.



613. NATO retains a qualitative advantage in airpower.      While the

latest generation of Soviet aircraft,  Fulcrum and Flanker,  are almost

as manoeuvrable as aircraft such as the US F-15,  F-16 and F-18 and

have look down/shoot down radar and improved missiles,  they have less

advanced avionics and are not as capable of multi-role operation. Th

higher quality of NATO aircraft is reinforced by airborne early

warning aircraft and air-to-air  refuelling capabilities.



614. At sea,  new Soviet nuclear-powered attack submarines such as the

DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL



ierra and Akula classes,  which are quieter than their predecessors,

ave improved the Soviet ability to threaten NATO&apos;s  reinforcements in

the Atlantic.    Naval  reconnaissance and strike capabilities are also

eing enhanced through,  for example,  the continued procurement of

ackfire bombers.    NATO probably still has a technological advantage

  many areas of naval warfare,  especially anti-submarine warfare, but

his is being eroded by the introduction of new and better Soviet

hips,  submarines and aircraft.

15. Strategic forces are those that can attack at very long range,

ncluding land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs),

ubmarine-launched ballistic missiles  (SLBMs),  and heavy bombers

arrying bombs,  air-launched cruise missiles  (ALCMs), and

ir-to-surface missiles  (ASMs).    In figure 12, we show the balance of

trategic systems;  the Soviet Union and the United States have roughly

he same number of delivery vehicles.    But we cannot say for sure how

any warheads each delivery vehicle actually carries.



(Figure 12 - The Balance of Nuclear Forces end 1988)



16. New deployments by the Soviet Union continue.    On land,  about 150

obile SS-25s were deployed by the end of 1988,  and,  in all,  more than

50 are expected to be operational within two or three years. The

en-warhead SS-24 ICBM has been deployed silo-based and on rail-mobile

aunchers;  the silo-launched version is nearing full operational

apability.    A modified version of the SS-18 heavy ICBM is entering

ervice.    At sea,  five Typhoon and four Delta IV nuclear-powered

allistic missile submarines  (SSBNs),  carrying the multiple-warhead

S-N-20 and SS-N-23 SLBMs,  are now operational;  a fifth Delta IV began

ea trials in 1988.    The SS-N-21 sea-launched cruise missile  (SLCM) is

ow operational,  and the supersonic SS-NX-24 SLCM could be deployed in

he early 1990s.    In the air,  a new strategic bomber,  the Blackjack,



as entered service;  it can carry the AS-15 ALCM as well as bombs and

SMs.    The AS-15 entered service in 1984 and is already deployed on

he Bear   bomber,  of which 70 are operational.    A supersonic AS-X-19

orces.    On land,  the ten-warhead Peacekeeper  (MX)   ICBM has been

deployed in Minuteman silos,  and 50 were  in place by the end of 1988.

wfhe United States plans eventually to deploy 100 Peacekeepers,

including those initially deployed in silos,  on mobile launchers. At

sea, Trident  (Ohio class)  SSBNs,  each able to carry 24 Trident C-4

SLBMs, are being deployed at the  rate of about one a year;  eight are

Bow operational.    The US SLBM capability will be improved by the

deployment of the Trident D-5.    SLCMs are being deployed on a variety

of platforms.    In the air,  the new B-lB bomber is operational and the

B-2 Advanced Technology Bomber,  using low-observable or &quot;stealth&quot;

technology,  is to enter service in the early 1990s.



Intermediate Forces



618. At the end of 1988,  there were 267 Soviet ground-launched

intermediate-range missiles  (those with ranges of between 500 km and

5500 km)  in Europe;  those deployed by NATO numbered 458.    The Soviet

eorce, however,  deploys more warheads  (741)  than NATO&apos;s (458).

Remaining intermediate-range systems are shown in Figure 12.    When the

MNF Treaty has been fully implemented,  the only remaining US and

Soviet INF systems from the Atlantic to the Urals will be

Sir-launched.    The Warsaw Pact has more aircraft of types known to be

ual-capable than NATO,   in both the longer- and shorter-range

ategories; many of these aircraft can carry ASMs with ranges of

everal hundred kilometres,  and we believe that new ASMs are being

eveloped.    The Warsaw Pact does not,  however,  say how many of these

lircraft are assigned to nuclear operations.    Figure 12 therefore

includes all Warsaw Pact aircraft of types known to be

luclear-capable.    For comparison,  the NATO column shows the total

lumber of aircraft belonging to types with a nuclear-capable variant,

&gt;ut only a portion of these  (as shown in the coloured section) are

issigned for nuclear use.



Short-Range Forces



119. Short-range nuclear forces  (with ranges of less than 500 km)

Consist of short-range ballistic missiles  (SRBMs)  and artillery. The

iarsaw Pact has a big advantage over NATO in short-range missile

Launchers (see Figure 12),  confirmed by the Warsaw Pact&apos;s assessment

&gt;f the balance (see paragraph 608).    The Soviet Union continues to

Jeploy the very accurate SS-21 SRBM.    As with tactical aircraft, many

artillery systems are dual-capable,  and we do not know how many of the

Warsaw Pact&apos;s are intended for nuclear use;  Figure 12 therefore shows

all Warsaw Pact artillery of types known to have a nuclear variant.

For comparison,  we also show the total number of NATO&apos;s dual-capable

artillery systems,  and,   in colour,  the number certified to deliver

nuclear shells.



620. Mr Shevardnadze announced in Vienna in January that the Soviet

troops to be withdrawn from Central Europe would take with them their

tactical nuclear weapons.    The numbers involved are however small; the

Soviet Union has not provided precise details but has admitted that it

is likely that as few as 24 out of 1,450 missile systems based in

Europe will be withdrawn.    Since 1979,  on the other hand,  NATO has

withdrawn more than a third of its nuclear warheads from Europe.



CHEMICAL WEAPONS



621. Technological advances over  recent decades have added a major net

dimension to the threat posed by chemical weapons.    The Soviet Union

possesses  research and development,  production and agent storage

facilities on an unrivalled scale and a comprehensive ability to

conduct warfare in a chemical environment.    It has a wide variety of

chemical agents,  both lethal and incapacitating,  and has a large

stockpile of chemical munitions; we assess that that stockpile is vec]

much larger than the 50,000 tonnes to which the Soviet Union admitted

in December 1987.    The Soviet Union&apos;s recent announcement that it is

to start destroying its stockpile is welcome,  but its overall

significance is unclear.



622. The United Kingdom gave up its offensive chemical warfare

capability in the 1950s.    The United States unilaterally stopped

producing chemical weapons in 1969;  only in December 1987 did it begir

to modernise its obsolescent stockpile with a safer binary form of

existing chemical agents,  because there was no sign at that time that

the Soviet Union was prepared to respond to Western concerns about its

capability for conducting chemical warfare.
