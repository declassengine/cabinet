a limited number of people in both the public and private

ceiling.    By giving passorts,  rather than requiring

people to come here to establish a right of abode

make it more likely that they will in fact stay il

PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY MINISTERS ON ASSURANCES FOR HONG KONG PEOPLE



24   May - Mr Renton during evidence to the Foreign Affairs



Committee:



&quot;If you were .... giving right to settle, right of

abode, to a large number of BDTCs currently in Hong

- we take the view that secondary legislation would

not be acceptable to the House and that, even if it

were technically feasible, it would require primary

legislation&quot;.



8 June - The Prime Minister in Oral Answers:



&quot;We have said that we are prepared to consider ways of

obtaining greater flexibility under the present rules

to allow an increasing number of people to come to

this country under the several different limbs of the

immigration rules and the British Nationality Act

1981.    We shall consider that matter carefully in the

coming days and,  if need be,  come to the House if we

need additional powers&quot;.



20 June - The Prime Minister during Oral Answers:



&quot;We are endeavouring to find increased flexibility,

first in the sections of thee British Nationality Act

1981 and,  secondly, under the broader immigration

rules&quot;.



5 July - Sir Geoffrey Howe in his statement to the House about



his visit to Hong Kong:



&quot;First,  on the question of nationality, we want to

enhance people&apos;s confidence to remain.    We are working

urgently on a scheme which will make some provision

for people in both the private and public sectors on

the basis not simply on connections with Britain but

the value of service to Hong Kong&quot;.


2



13 July - Sir Geoffrey Howe in the Hong Kong debate:



&quot;It is surely right that we should do what we can to

sustain in those people on whom the success and

prosperity of Hong Kong depends the confidence to

remain.    Their continued presence in the territory

benefits everyone living there.    If they lose faith in

the future,  all of Hong Kong will suffer.    That is why

we are working urgently on    a scheme which will make

some provision for people in both the private and

public sectors on the basis of value of service to

Hong Kong as well as connections with Britain. New

legislation may be necessary.    Our response will be as

generous as it can be, within the inevitable

constraints.&quot;



&quot;Our objective will be to devise a scheme which is as

open and fair as possible,  consistent with the

overriding aim of encouraging people whose service is

of value of Hong Kong to remain there.    That applies

to those involved in the Administration on Hong Kong -

and not exclusively at the senior levels,  and to those

whose professional,  technical, entrepreneurial and

managerial skills are essential to helping Hong Kong

to remain prosperous and stable.    It also applies to

those in particularly sensitive posts.    A further,

more detailed announcement will be made as soon as

possible.&quot;



24 October    - Prime Minister&apos;s interview with the BBC World Service

in Kuala Lumpur



&quot;We would hope either by the end of the year or at

the turn of the year to be able to get a package out.

It would,  of course,  require legislation and it is

important that we get it right.    I should think round

about the turn of the year&quot;.

ANNEX  



STATEMENT ON HONG KONG



With permission, Mr Speaker,  I should like to make a

statement about our proposals to improve confidence in

Hong Kong.



The confidence of the people of Hong Kong has been

seriously shaken this year by events in China.    My rt

hon and learned Friend the Lord President told the

House on 6 June about the traumatic effect in Hong Kong

of the tragedy in Peking on 4 June, and reported to the

House on   5 July after he had paid a visit to the

territory.    Many honourable and rt honourable members

have themselves visited Hong Kong since June. The

House Select Committee on Foreign Affairs gave a lucid

account of the problem in Hong Kong in their report of

28 June.



The Government must do all it can to build a secure

future for Hong Kong on the basis of the Sino-British

Joint    Declaration of 1984.    We have a continuing

responsibility which we cannot shrug off and which will

involve us in many difficult decisions between now and

1997.



The problem of confidence is shown by increasing

emigration from the territory, and increasing numbers



SECRET


SECRET

of people who contemplate leaving.    42,000 people have

left Hong Kong this year.    55,000 are expected to leave

next year.    A growing proportion of these people are

those whom Hong Kong can least afford to lose. This

haemorrhage of talent puts at risk the competitiveness

of Hong Kong&apos;s economy,  the efficiency of its public

service,  the effectiveness of its education system, in

short its future.



Many of those who are leaving Hong Kong would not do so

if they could obtain the assurance of right of abode in

the UK.    As hon members will be aware from statements

by the Prime Minister and other rt hon Friends,  we have

been working on a scheme to give such assurances to a

limited number of key people and their dependents in

the public and private sectors.    The Foreign Affairs

Committee recommended such a scheme in their report in

June, and my rt hon and learned Friend the Lord

President told the House on 5 July that we would

provide one.    I can now explain to the House the

conclusions we have reached.



We aim to give such people the confidence to remain in

Hong Kong so that they can continue to make their

contribution to the success and prosperity of the

territory.    We have to weigh in the balance our ability

to accept the individuals concerned for settlement in



SECRET


SECRET

this country,  should that ever be necessary.    We have

had to set this reality against our desire to be as

effective as possible in restoring confidence to Hong

Kong.



If,  as has often been suggested, we gave the right of

abode to all holders of British Dependent Territory

Citizen passports in Hong Kong, we could if that right

was exercised create unacceptable strains here.    If we

kept the scheme too narrow it would fail in its purpose

and at the end of the day we might be faced with a much

more severe problem.



After careful and detailed consideration over several

months, we have concluded that the assurance to be

given should take the form of full British citizenship

which would be awarded to recipients without their

having to leave Hong Kong.    With dependants,  the total

who will receive assurances will not exceed 225,000.

This figure will be an absolute ceiling.    We estimate

that it would cover about 60,000 households. The

scheme would cease by 1997.    It is thus strictly

limited in scope,  numbers and time.



Beneficiaries will be selected on the basis of a points

system.    The scheme will embrace people from a wide

range of walks of life in Hong Kong.    It will cover



SECRET


SECRET

professional and business people and those with

particular technical and managerial skills, as well as

those in the public and disciplined services. The

decisive criteria will be the value of the individual&apos;s

service to Hong Kong and their propensity, without a UK

passport,  to emigrate.



In addition, provision will be made for those who, by

virtue of their position, may find themselves

vulnerable in the years ahead.    Long service with

British institutions in Hong Kong will be taken into

account.



In addition to this scheme but within the total number

I have given,  the Government propose to introduce a

special measure designed to assist companies and

institutions in Hong Kong to retain their key

personnel.    We intend to reduce substantially the

period of residence in this country that employees of

such organisations would have to fulfil in order to

achieve settled status and subsequently citizenship.

For those accepted on the scheme, employment or service

in Hong Kong after the period of residence in the UK

would count towards the total qualifying residence

period.    The companies and institutions concerned would

arrange secondments of key personnel for work or

training purposes for relatively short periods of time,

thereby minimising any disruption to their work in Hong

Kong.



There is already provision under the British

Nationality Act for those in Crown Service to be

registered as British Citizens.    But new powers will

need to be sought in order to grant British Citizenship

to people in the private sector.    Our intention is to

introduce the necessary legislation in this session of

Parliament.    Proposals will be put forward as soon as

poss ible.



I emphasise two points.    First, these proposals will be

restricted to Hong Kong and the unique problem which we

face there.    They will have no relevance to other

people elsewhere, and the principles of the 1981

British Nationality Act will remain intact. Second,

they are designed not to encourage immigration into

this country but to anchor in Hong Kong those whom we

need to retain there if our last substantial colony is

to pass successfully through the final eight years of

British rule.
