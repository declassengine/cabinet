by   any   let-up   on our policy of restraining the growth of public

spending.    The fact that we are currently running a budget surplus

  no way modifies this conclusion; as the economy slows down, the

plus is likely to fall.



ECONOMY



4. ^&apos;   world economy grew much more rapidly than expected in

1988,Wank, in every country within the G7 forecasts of the growth

of GNP and domestic demand were exceeded. GNP growth in the G7 as

a   whole   reached 4*s per cent and world trade in manufactures grew



by 10^ per ce



5.      The indr

buoyant   in th

Germany appears t

signs   of growth s

policy.



s are that the world economy has remained very

t   half   of   this year.    Growth in Japan and

icularly strong, though there are clear

in the US in response to tighter monetary



6.      The strong growth WE the past two years is in large part the



result   of   a   worldwide   investment boom, in response to the more



stable economic environment of the 19808 with lower inflation and

less intervention by government]



7. This dynamism in the wd^n^Jconomy has, however, brought

with it increasing inflationary pr^Kms. Capacity utilisation

is at historically high levels, and nJ&amp;Bkion has risen in all the

major industrial countries. In response, all the major countries

have raised interest rates since the sfH^k of last year. While

in the US interest rates may already^^J^ peaked, European

interest rates were raised further in the last week in June, and a

further increase is also likely in Japan.



8.       Provided that countries   continue   to take

action     to     restrain   inflation   the prospect

satisfactory growth in the world economy, though

lower rate than in 1988.

THE BRITISH ECONOMY



0^ There are now clear signs that growth of GDP and domestic

\rafknd have begun to moderate in response to recent rises in

^Mlest rates. GDP growth in 1989 as a whole is now forecast to

be 0^r cent, just a little below the Budget forecast. But this

is i^r^l^an accounted for by lower North Sea production following

recen^^iccidents.



10.



The growth of   personal   sector   spending   has   slowed down



sharply. Re

Even with continued strong growth of

owth of total domestic demand is likely



to be much lower in 1989^^k 3 per cent, than the 6h per cent

recorded last year. Nevertheless in the circumstances this is

still too rapid, and needs to come down further if inflation and

the current account deficit are to fall significantly. This will

require policy to remain tight ^^^30me time yet



pressure   on   capacity in

half of last year. These

should ease further as

comes on stream as a

output grows more slowly and new

result of the investment boom,

however, has shown more worrying symptoms^^^^pacity constraints,

with serious shortages of labour and evidence that prices are

rising much faster than in the rest of the economy - well into

double figures. The latest DTI and CBI surveys of investment

intentions, together with evidence from the A kstry itself,

suggests continuing growth of construction de ^jiW capacity

constraints are likely to persist for some whimrJ4a  in this

sector.

L2. Underlying inflation has been higher so far in 1989 than

ivisaged at Budget time, having risen throughout the recent

Lod of very strong growth. The RPI excluding mortgage interest

its - the nearest equivalent to the measures of consumer

pr^g^used in nearly all other major countries - was 6 per cent

hig^fl^fcthan a year ago in May. Including mortgage interest

paymCTi^p^PI inflation in May was 8.3 per cent. And pay is

continuing to grow more rapidly than is desirable, especially in

the public sector.



13. I now exigy total RPI inflation to be 6% per cent in the

fourth quarte^e^L this year, above the forecast of 5*5 per cent

published at tK^Sfteof the Budget. By that time, however, other

less distorted m^ls of inflation - such as producer prices and



the RPI less mortg

stabilised   and be

nevertheless be about

with   5h per   cent in

particularly buoyant.



Jterest payments - should also have clearly

fall.     Growth of the GDP deflator may

get forecast, with especially strong

the   investment   sector   where   demand is

in 1988 and a substantial defic

though   in   the   light   of the

accounts the true deficit may well

possible   gradually to reduce this def

finance it, provided we maintain a pol

ccount deficit of  15 billion

ersisted so far this year -

balancing   items in the

stated.     It   should be

and in the meantime to

tance   that severely



15. The public finances remain strong, though there are some

signs that the PSDR in 1989-90 may prove slightly smaller than I

budgeted for in March. Our policies to boost personal pensions

have been more successful than anyone for 

consequential rebates of national insurance contl

reduce government revenues, though in the longer term&quot;

be substantial savings on SERPS spending. And the^

cyclical influences which have boosted the surplus over

two years will tend to unwind as the economy slows do\

fiscal   projections   in   the   MTFS   showed     minimal scope&apos;

liscretionary   tax   reductions   given   present   public expenditure

, even with the budget reverting gradually   to   balance. It

expenditure obliged   us   to   raise   taxes   to   maintain an

jely tight fiscal stance.

16. The policies which we have pursued in the 1980s have greatly

strengthened the British economy. But there are clear risks in

the present ^^kuation. We must not weaken in the fight against

inflation. A^JI^iLme when we are seeking to reduce the growth of

private sectoi^R^tand it is vital not add to our difficulties by

expanding to publq^Hactor&apos; s claims on resources.
