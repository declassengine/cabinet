DOCK LABOUR SCHEME



morandum by the Secretary of State for Employment



Under the HA^i^irs item at Thursday Cabinet 1 shall seek the agreement

of colleagues ^  ?  abolition of the Dock Labour Scheme and the repeal of

the legislatio^kiSAi. which the Scheme was made.



Background



2.    The Scheme provia^6 9k a statutory monopoly on dock work in all of

the ports listed in thq^^ |inal Scheme made in 1947.    These  include forty

of the country&apos;s seventy five main ports and handle seventy per cent of

non-oil port traffic.



3.    The Scheme places control of al1

and severance questions in the

employers and trade unionists,

internationally competitive indus!

labour practices; deters investme

in inner cities;  increases costs; a

the Single European Market in 1992 a

handicaps.



4.    Port employers have campaigned vigoro 

200 of our own back-benchers have signed

the end of the Scheme.    Recent developments

highlighted the case for action (see Annex A)T

of boards having equal numbers of

6.    The Bill provides for abolition of the present statutory

dock work.    It would extend normal employment rights to dock Vol

currently covered by the Scheme.    And it would establish, throu!

regulations made and operated by the Transport Department, specii

payments for such dock workers who were made redundant after aboli&quot;Ei

Payments would be up to  35,000 in the first eighteen months and  20,000

for a further eighteen months and would be shared equally between

Government and employers.    The National Dock Labour Board would be

aintained for a transitional period only,  to wind down its health,

lfare and training activities in an orderly way.    We would aim to secure

passage of the Bill by July,  using normal procedures though we could

:qjeiLder accelerated procedures in the light of strikes and disruption to



?nation&apos;s trade.    The provisions would take effect immediately on

Assent.



7.    The Cabinet Office Assessment stresses the uncertainties of any

predic tionsabout industrial action,  suggests that non-scheme ports are

unlikely A^^B disrupted for long but that some major Scheme ports might



be out f

of the economy will vary both in speed and severity but

e no unacceptable impact on food and oil supplies,

jn page 23 of the White Paper sets out the effect of the

fish landing at Aberdeen and Grimsby.    Since that was

cibout ten days ago there have been a few developments

strengthening the case further.



In Aberdeen atMtapts to establish a new fish landing company have

run into dif^J^^es because too few of the surplus dockers are

prepared to lea^^Q^r  25,000 and because the TGWU is claiming a

substantial pay l^^^ise for those who remain.    The Aberdeen

Harbour Board annorradfl^the closure of the port for the landing of

white fish as from 33^ffiAch.    Subsequently they agreed to keep it

open for a further weeVlo^ee if a conciliated settlement could be

achieved.



In Grimsby the key development has been a series of reports that

many of the 40 registered worker^Kho land fish there think that

the present arrangements restri^Jk&amp;eir earnings and are therefore

preparing a joint approach, with their employers, to have fish



landing at Grimsby removed from th

been made and the TGWU are trying to



No such approach has

CHAPTER 1



Britainss Ports: A Time for Change



1.1 The standard of living of British people has always depended on

our ability to compete as a trading nation. More than most

countries, we depend on the efficiency with which we convert

imports of raw materials into exports of finished products. Trade

accounts for nearly 60% of our national income, twice the

proportion of Japan and equalled only by West Germany. Our 75

principal seaports are our main trading link. In 1987 95% of all

imports and exports passed through our ports accounting for 78%

of the value of our trade. They handled 456 million tonnes of

goods: equivalent to 9 tonnes for each person in the country.



1.2 British jobs depend on the efficiency and reliability of British ports.

Inefficient ports, which charge more than necessary and offer a

poor service, add to the cost of raw materials and to the price of

everything we buy and sell. If British people are to gain from the

extra trade generated by 1992&apos;s Single European Market, then our

ports must play their part. Efficient ports can ensure that our

businesses are supplied, and our goods are delivered, at competitive

rates, on time, all the time. They can add to the attractions of

Britain as a base for American and Japanese investment in the

European Community&apos;s single market. In a market without trade

barriers we will pay for inefficient ports with lost exports, lost

investment and lost jobs.



jrougher 1.3 Our ports stand to gain from the growth of Britain&apos;s economy and



Otnpetition for expanding international trade. Freight traffic through them has



|)Ur Ports grown for six consecutive years. But to benefit in full, they must be



ready to meet an unprecedented range of challenges.



(a) Competition from ports in Belgium, Holland, France and

Germany, which have captured more of our trade with other

continents, will be maintained: the proportion of our trade

with Asia, Africa, North and South America and Australasia

which passed through Dutch or Belgian ports increased from

4% to 11% between 1976 and 1986.



(b) Competition from air freight for compact, high value cargo

will continue to grow: a fifth of our trade is already transported

by this means.



(c) The Single European Market brings the prospect of more trade

between the Community and other continents as well as more

trade between its members, which means more business for

ports which can compete in a market without barriers.


(d)  The Channel Tunnel will provide stiff competition in tn

with the Community and with other continents: for the!

time Britain will have a land link with its trading partner!

which will allow international trade to bypass our ports

completely.



The Challenge

for our Ports



he  

fechen



estri



1.4 These challenges add up to an increasingly tough competitive

climate for our ports. If they can match the best in Europe in

efficiency and quality of service, they will flourish. If they fall

behind, ports in Belgium, France, Germany and Holland will

attract an even bigger share of our trade with other continents,

goal for our ports is to improve their performance so that busin

investment and jobs are attracted to Britain.



1.5 Many of our ports are not ready to make the best of these

challenges. There are wide divergences in their performance,

need the freedom to compete on more equal terms with each 0!

so that overall levels of efficiency match those of the best. Only]

then will British industry get the service it needs at the least

possible cost. Britain&apos;s competitiveness and jobs depend on thai



The Employment

Framework for

Success



1.6 Well-motivated and productive workers are a key element in til

success of any business. Our ports are no different from the restj

industry in this respect. The right framework for industrial

relations is essential to secure this. The new strength of Britain]

economy owes much to the transformation of our industrial

relations encouraged by the Government&apos;s reforms of employn

law since 1980. Attitudes have changed: people at work now

understand that their own pay and jobs depend on the success 01

organisation they work for. That transformation is now attracti:

higher levels of overseas investment in British jobs than ever

before.



1.7 In order to make a success of the challenges they face, ourports|

need a common framework for their industrial relations that

encourages the positive attitudes among port workers and the

effective management essential to produce greater efficiency an

better service. Such a framework does not exist at present. The

Dock Labour Scheme, which applies to a majority of our

ports, sustains attitudes and practices in dock work which

run counter to the needs of an efficient and successful po!

industry, strong enough to face growing competitive

pressures. The Scheme dates from legislation passed in 1946 arj

continues to deny those ports the full benefits of the improved

climate of industrial relations which the changed attitudes of ttj

1980s have brought to British industry as a whole.


;k Labour      1.8 The Scheme gives the National Dock Labour Board, with equal

?S numbers of union and employer members, and its 20 similarly



jons constituted local boards, wide powers to dictate the numbers of



people employed in dock work and influence the way they are

employed. The Scheme and arrangements linked to it provide for:



a legal monopoly over dock work: only employers

registered by the boards can do business in dock work defined

by the Scheme and they face criminal prosecution if without

the Board&apos;s permission, they use anyone other than a docker

registered by the boards to do that work;



a legal definition of what is dock work and where it

takes place: the nature of dock work and the areas subject to

the Scheme&apos;s constraints are largely those defined in the

original 1947 Scheme, subject to court rulings in disputed

cases;



control of numbers by local boards: an employer who

wishes to recruit a dock worker or reduce the number he

employs can do so only with the approval of the local board;



control of discipline by local boards: the Scheme&apos;s

provisions override normal legal requirements and dock

workers can be dismissed from employment under the Scheme

only with the approval of a board;



&quot;a job for life&quot;: in practice, employers, individually or

collectively, are responsible for paying a registered dock

worker until he volunteers for redundancy, whatever the state

of their finances.



1.9 There are no comparable legal constraints on employers&apos; freedom

to manage their work force effectively in any other industry. By

placing key decisions over employment in dock work in the

hands of boards where unions can block vital changes, the

Scheme deprives employers of their responsibility for

effective management. By encouraging the view that their

work and pay is unrelated to the performance of the business

in which they are employed, the Scheme undermines

workers5 incentives to improve efficiency. These handicaps are

continuing to inhibit the majority of our ports from working at

peak efficiency and developing their full business and employment

potential.



3


The Division

between Scheme

and non-scheme

Ports



1.10 Scheme ports are still in the majority though they no longer

monopolise our ports industry, as the map opposite shows. Ofo

75 main ports 40 operate under the restrictions the Scheme can

impose on their performance. They employ about 28,000 peop!

told, 9,400 of whom are registered workers who alone can hair

cargo. The Scheme now divides British ports arbitrarily

distorts competition between them. It also creates two

classes of port employee: a declining minority - register

dock workers - who are covered by its special arrangeme

and a growing majority of other port workers, to whom

normal working conditions and employment rights app]



Scheme Ports:

Realising their

Potential



1.11 Ports outside the Scheme are flourishing. There are now over 3.

which handle nearly 30% of our trade (excluding oil). Most

escaped the Scheme simply because they were insignificant asc

ports when it started. Things have changed. Felixstowe, now

Britain&apos;s fourth ranking port for non-oil cargo, is far larger that

most Scheme ports which compete with it. Free from the Sche

restrictive practices, the share of Britain&apos;s trade handled by port!

outside the Scheme continues to grow. More business attracted

an efficient service, not restrictive practices, has brought more]

These ports now employ nearly 10,000 people and are creating

in dock work while dock work in Scheme ports continues to

decline.



1.12 While the Scheme remains, dock work in most of our major po

will be reserved by law for registered dock workers. Though th?

ports have lost ground, the Scheme cannot wither away natural!

without the permanent closure of all Scheme ports. Many of th

ports have great potential which needs to be realised: letting the

waste away until all were closed would be a perverse cure for the

of the Scheme. The areas surrounding them - many in our inne

cities - are producing fewer new jobs in port related work becau

of the disincentive to invest in areas covered by the Scheme&apos;s

restrictions. To date Scheme ports have also cost the taxpayer ov

; 770 million, at today&apos;s prices, in subsidies and special support

redundancy payments to registered dock workers. To this must

added the cost to British business, and inconvenience to the put

of poor industrial relations. While the Scheme remains, the risk

that local disputes will escalate into national dock strikes is ever

present, as history has shown.

Basis for 1.13 The case for reform to allow Scheme ports to develop their full



Bcessful Ports potential is overwhelming. This White Paper describes the Scheme



and how it has developed, and analyses its practices and their

consequences. It shows that the circumstances in which the Scheme

was conceived and the problems it sought to solve belong to a

bygone age, while the attitudes that thrive under it damage Scheme

ports, their customers, employees, and the economy as a whole.

The White Paper concludes that the Scheme should be abolished

and that the same rights and obligations as apply to workers

generally - including most port workers - should apply to

registered dock workers in Scheme ports.



1.14 This reform will help all our ports to face the challenges of the



1990s on more equal terms and to seize in full the opportunities for

business and jobs which those challenges can provide. Only then

will all our ports be playing their full part in sustaining our

performance as a trading nation and the jobs which depend on our

success.

Origins



CHAPTER 2



The Dock Labour Scheme and today&apos;s ports industry



2.1 Attempts to control casual employment in British ports first four

expression in the creation of a register of dock workers in Liverp

in 1912. During both World Wars the combination of conscript

and the need to ensure there were enough people to carry outdo

work led to the development of more formal and widespread

registration Schemes.



2.2 Since the Second World War there have been three main Acts,?

statutory schemes and an industrial agreement which, taken

together, provide the basis for the regulation of dock work in

Scheme ports today.



The 1940s -

basic legislation



2.3 Theb asic Act was, and remains, the 1946 Dock Workers



(Regulation of Employment) Act. This Act enables Schemes to I

made for ensuring greater regularity of employment for dock

workers and for securing that an adequate number of dock work

is available for the efficient performance of their work. This Act

also provides for criminal law penalties on employers who break

certain requirements of a Scheme.



2.4 Two Schemes have been made under the 1946 Act. The first, the

1947 Dock Labour Scheme, contained three elements which art

features of today&apos;s arrangements. First, it established the Nation

Dock Labour Board (NDLB) with equal numbers of employera

worker representatives to administer the Scheme. Secondly, it

defined the content of dock work and where it takes place

according to wartime and pre-war definitions. Thirdly it listed

some 84 ports to which the Scheme applied. Those ports accoun

for virtually all dock work at that time and employed 80,000 doc

workers who formed the bulk of their workforce.



The 1960s-

end of casual

employment



2.5 In spite of the 1947 Scheme there was little improvement in

industrial relations, efficiency or in the modernisation of British

ports and in the mid 1960s an attempt was made to correct this b]

bringing about a closer relationship between individual employe

and dockers. This was done by the 1966 Docks and Harbours Ac

which provided a system of licensing employers to reduce their

numbers, and by the 1967 Dock Labour Scheme which is the on

currently in operation.



8


2.6 The key feature of the 1967 Scheme, the second introduced under

the 1946 Act, was that it ended casual employment in Scheme

ports. Under the 1947 Scheme registered dock workers had

essentially been employed by the NDLB who paid their wages,

insurance and holiday pay through a combination of a levy on

registered employers and billing of employers for work done by the

dockers. Under the 1967 Scheme each registered dock worker was

to be allocated to a registered employer on a permanent basis.



2.7 In the early 1970s changed cargo handling methods meant that an

empts to                       increasing share of goods was passing through ports in containers



and the Scheme anc^ m a f rm which enabled them to be driven on and off the



vessels carrying them. These developments, &quot;containerisation&quot; and

&quot;roll on roll off&quot;, substantially reduced the number of dock workers

needed to load and unload ships. At the same time, the main

direction of UK trade was switching towards continental Europe

and the east coast, where many new ports were developing to

which the Scheme did not apply. As a result port employers were

requiring fewer and fewer dockers. The 1967 Scheme provided that

employers could, with the consent of the local board, end the

employment of a registered worker subject only to a specified

period of notice. In these circumstances the local board could either

remove the docker&apos;s name from the register or place him on what

became known as the Temporarily Unattached Register (TUR).

With the persistent surpluses of dockers in the late 1960s and early

1970s an increasing number of registered workers were placed on

the TUR and employed by the National Board. The trade unions

saw a large TUR as threatening a return to casual employment

which the 1967 Scheme had been designed to end.



2.8 These developments led to a series of fierce disputes and strikes in

and around many ports over a claim by registered dock workers that

the filling and emptying of containers (&quot;stuffing and stripping&quot;)

should be the job of registered workers.



2.9 Against this background, in 1972, a joint committee chaired by Lord

Aldington (then Chairman of the Port of London Authority) and

Mr Jack Jones (then General Secretary of the Transport and General

Workers Union) recommended a new set of arrangements which,

although non-statutory, effectively eliminated the flexibility

provided by the TUR. Under these arrangements port employers

were to retain, on at least basic pay, any registered dock workers

for whom there was no work and accept additional workers allocated

to them by local boards from employers who went out of business

- including over 1,600 workers then on the TUR. The committee

also recommended more attractive terms for the industry&apos;s National

Voluntary Severance Scheme under which older workers were

encouraged to volunteer for redundancy. These recommendations

were accepted as the price for ending a national dock strike and

the Government paid for the improved redundancy terms.



ington-Jones

mgements



9


2.10 &quot;Stuffing and stripping&quot; and the growth of non-scheme ports als

lay behind the third key post-war Act, the 1976 Dock Work

Regulation Act. This was intended to resolve disputes over the

boundaries of dock work by making an enlarged NDLB, still wit

equal union and employer representation, responsible for

recommending what should be classified as dock work. The Act

also provided for a new Dock Labour Scheme to be extended to

&quot;definable dock areas within half a mile of the nearest harbour

land&quot;. Such a draft Scheme was produced in 1978 but Parliament

rejected it.



The Scheme Today    2.11 Under the statutory Scheme and the non-statutory Aldington-



Jones arrangements, employment in Scheme ports has the

following features.



(i) A statutory monopoly.



Only employers who are on a register maintained by the Dt

Labour Boards may undertake dock work. Only workers w

are on a similar register of dock workers may carry out such

work. If an employer employs anyone else on dock work

without the approval of the local dock labour board he mak

himself liable to prosecution and imprisonment for up to 3

months, a fine or both. When approval is given for other

people to be used (for example, to handle specialised cargo)

registered dock workers will also be allocated to the task an

be paid as if they were doing it.



(ii) A statutory definition of what is dock work a

the areas where the Scheme applies.



What Work is reserved by law for registered dock workers,

and the areas where those restrictions apply, vary from port

port, but the definitions are essentially those which operate

in wartime regulations. This means, for example, that in

many ports dock work is confined to cargo handling, while

others warehouse activities are included. The same historic

considerations dictate the areas which the Scheme covers  

each port, even though dock work in those areas may have

long since ceased. For example the Scheme still extends to

dock work on the Thames as far upstream as Teddingtonan

to much of the Clyde and the Tees. Disputes over the

application of these definitions fall to be settled by Industn

Tribunals.



10


(iii) Control of numbers by national and local dock

labour boards.



The NDLB&apos;s twenty local boards - made up of equal

numbers of employers&apos; and workers&apos; representatives - are

alone responsible for deciding how many, and which, people

are included on the boards&apos; registers. This means that the joint

boards control recruitment and severance. Any employer

wishing to recruit a dock worker or reduce the number he

employs must do so through the local boards.



(iv) Control of discipline by local boards.



The only disciplinary sanctions open to employers are

suspension of an employee for 5 days or dismissal from his

employment. Anyone dismissed will have their case reviewed

by the local board and anyone suspended may appeal to the

board. The board may oblige an employer to withdraw a

suspension or to reinstate an employee. Only the board can

dismiss a dock worker from the Scheme. If the board upholds

an employer&apos;s decision, the employee may take his case to a

local Appeals Tribunal, composed of equal numbers of

employer and employee representatives, occasionally with

independent members.



(v) Involvement of NDLB in other functions.



The Board supervises and contributes funds to medical and

welfare facilities and training for registered dock workers. The

boards also administer severance and pension schemes for the

industry although they have no direct role in determining the

terms on which payments are made. These services and other

activities of the boards are financed by a levy on registered

employers which added 2.75% (jC4.7m) to their wage bill in

1988.



(vi) &quot;Ajob for life&quot;.



The 1967 Scheme clearly envisages the Temporarily

Unattached Register (TUR) as a means of reducing manning

when there is insufficient work and provides for workers to be

dismissed by a board or, with a board&apos;s approval, by employers,

subject only to minimum periods of notice. However, the

restriction on the TUR under Aldington-Jones and the

Board&apos;s unwillingness, ever since its inception, to sanction

redundancies other than through expensive voluntary

severance, means that this has been the only way to reduce

persistent surpluses of registered dock workers. Indeed, once a

dock worker is on the register, employers - individually or

collectively - are in practice responsible for paying him until

such time as he volunteers for redundancy. In that sense the

registered worker has &quot;a job for life&quot;.

The Success of

non-scheme Ports



2.12 Scheme ports remain Britain&apos;s foremost trading link, though

have lost business and jobs to ports which have grown outside

Scheme. Those ports now handle nearly 30% of our non-oil tri

compared with less than 10% of a much smaller tonnage just 2

years ago.

Non-scheme Ports:

2.13 The adaptability of workers in ports outside the Scheme has hel

them to capture around half of the fast-growing container and&quot;

on roll off&quot; trade. Scheme ports, constrained by the Scheme&apos;s

archaic definitions and rigid practices, were less able to maketh

rapid gains in productivity and customer service which these ne

cargo handling technologies allowed. Ports outside the Scheme

have also been more responsive to the shift towards greater trade

with the European Community, which has favoured ports on

east coast. A number of Scheme ports were well placed to ben

but none has matched the performance of non-scheme Felixstoj

now Britain&apos;s 4th ranking port for non-oil cargo. It has achieve!

14 fold increase in cargo handled in 20 years.



2.14 A falling share of business and long delayed improvements in

productivity in Scheme ports is costing them still more jobs, w

employment in dock work in ports outside the Scheme has provj

more stable. Scheme ports have lost 30% of their jobs since 1983

and by 1987 they employed 28,000 people, 9,400 of whom are

registered dock workers. In 1987 ports outside the Scheme empl

10,000 people of whom 3,900 were dock workers, a 10% increi

since 1983. Over a quarter of all dock workers are now

employed in ports to which the Scheme&apos;s constraints don!

apply.

2.15 Despite the absence of the Scheme&apos;s legal restrictions, which aimed

to protect employment conditions, the conditions of dock workers

in ports outside the Scheme compare with those which apply to

industrial workers generally:



- the pay of dock workers in ports outside the Scheme is

competitive. There is no evidence that non-scheme ports are

having difficulty in attracting recruits. Most ports outside the

Scheme negotiate pay and conditions locally with trade unions

- generally the same unions who represent registered dock

workers, whose pay is also locally determined. Pay therefore

varies: in the non-scheme port of Felixstowe in 1987

employees earned on average over ^330 per week, enough to

place them in the top 25% of manual and non-manual earners

for that year.



:



Health and Safety:

ts



|e Scheme:

anachronism



- casual working in ports outside the Scheme is minimal,

and no more widespread than in many other industries.



In 1987 only 6% of all dock workers in those ports were

employed on a casual basis. That proportion has remained

stable over a number of years and is not a threat to the

employment conditions of permanent staff. This shows that

modern cargo handling methods in efficient ports require the

employment of properly trained permanent staff. There is

neither the scope nor the incentive for a return to widespread

casual work in our ports.



2.16 It is also significant that health and safety standards apply

throughout the ports industry whether or not people are covered by

the Scheme. The Dock Regulations, proposed by the Health and

Safety Commission and made by the Government in 1988, provide

an up to date health, safety and welfare framework for the whole

industry. They place clear obligations on all port employers for the

safety of their employees and provide wider powers for the Health

and Safety Executive in all our ports. The Health and Safety at

Work Act 1974 also provides unions with ample opportunity to

contribute to proper provision for health and safety of workers in

ports, in or out of the Scheme.



2.17 The growth and stability of employment in ports outside the

Scheme, and the working conditions they provide, demonstrate

that the general legal framework which now applies to

employment in Britain is sufficient on its own to protect the rights

of dock workers. The Dock Labour Scheme, which has evolved in

the way described in this Chapter, has been shown to be

increasingly irrelevant and unnecessary to secure proper

employment conditions for dock workers. The next Chapter shows

how the Scheme in practice works against the interests of the

economy and the ports industry which provides dock workers with

jobs.



13


CHAPTER 3



The impact of the Scheme and the need for reform



Whatever its merits in dealing with early post-war problems of

dock manpower, the Dock Labour Scheme has proved to be a

serious obstacle to efficiency in Britain&apos;s ports industry and

therefore to our wider economic progress. Although registered

dock workers now account for only one in three of all Scheme po

employees, their work is at the core of the business, and has a

disproportionate effect on overall results.



A Barrier to 3.1

Competition



3.2 The Scheme is flawed fundamentally - both in concept and in th

way it operates. Joint management and union control of

employment and discipline, and the attitudes which that has

encouraged, delay or prevent decisions being taken whenever

interests appear to diverge, as they inevitably sometimes do. Thai

has crucially impeded Scheme ports&apos; ability to adapt and develop

their services to customers, added enormously to costs, held back

modernisation and reduced the productivity of new investment.

The Scheme has led to a loss of business and of jobs.



The Consequences 3.3 The Scheme now applies to only 9,400 registered dock workers,

of the Scheme but it continues to impede the development of the ports to which



applies and has a far wider impact.



Management is shackled by the unions&apos; effective veto over an!

employment changes it does not support. The statutory

monopoly of dock work makes it impossible to use the whole

workforce as productively as possible. The boards undermine

managers&apos; responsibility for discipline and constrain their

freedom to recruit competent, productive workers.



The registered dock workers and their unions have seen a

relentless decline in jobs, which the Scheme has been unable!

prevent and which is still continuing, even while jobs in dock

work in ports outside the Scheme increase.



14


Scheme ports are still hampered by the inefficient use of

manpower sanctioned by damaging restrictive practices.

Industrial relations are soured by the creation of two classes of

employees - registered dock workers and the rest - and union

threats to call for national dock strikes over local issues which

should be resolved according to local needs.



Surrounding areas, many of them in inner cities, have been

deprived of valuable job-creating investment for fear that some

activities would be claimed as dock work, with all the restrictions

implied. Restrictions on recruitment for dock work have also cost

local young people jobs.



Port users and British industry generally are burdened with

unnecessary costs, in time and money, which arise where port

services are less than fully efficient and reliable.



The taxpayer has had to contribute, at today&apos;s prices, over  770

million in subsidies and in payments for voluntary severances -

; 12,400 for every dock worker who has left the industry since

1972 - to maintain some Scheme ports in being and to reduce

registered dock worker surpluses by the only means available.



Above all, Britain as a whole suffers from the defects of this

crucial link in the chain of the nation&apos;s trade.



r Surpluses      3.4 The number of registered dock workers employed in a port may



only be reduced with the agreement of the local dock labour board,

confirmed by the National Board. In practice the union

representatives agree only if reductions are achieved by voluntary

severance. These procedures have been insufficient to secure the

manning levels needed to make Scheme ports competitive. The

costs of unproductive surplus labour simply serve to increase port

charges or reduce investment, leading to a further loss of business

and pressure on jobs. The Scheme underpins this vicious circle.



15


3.5 The National Dock Labour Board publishes estimates of surplus

labour each year, ranging from 6% to 18% since 1967 and standin

at 9.6% in 1987. This addition to labour costs, plus the Scheme&apos;s

restrictions on the tasks of registered dock workers, prevent

competition on equal terms with ports outside the Scheme. They

can avoid surpluses by using dock workers for a wider range of

work. Even where local boards approve, Scheme port employersa

discouraged from doing so for fear that custom and practice migti

bring these tasks within the scope of the Scheme and its

restrictions. They have no real choice but to bear the surplus costs

until they can reduce their labour force through voluntary

severance, mainly at public expense.



3.6 The rigid imposition of the Aldington-Jones recommendations 11 

made matters worse. The average level of surplus labour increased

from the time of their implementation, in 1972. That was

inevitable, as the recommendations required any surplus dock

workers (arising, for example, from the closure of an employer or

the existence of a Temporarily Unattached Register) to be allocate

to remaining employers in a port, threatening still more jobs as

Case 1 demonstrates.



3.7 Unproductive surplus labour can no longer be justified by the

irregularity of dock work. Modern, capital-intensive cargo

handling methods and port traffic control, combined with an

adaptable labour force, enable work to be planned ahead. Paying

large numbers of dock workers to do nothing in Scheme ports

undermines the finances of port employers and threatens thejobs

the majority of their employees who are not covered by the

Scheme.


Case 1: Liverpool - the closure of   andj Harrison

and Bulk Cargo Handling Services.



In 1980 the Port of Liverpool already had a large surplus of labour,

which voluntary severance alone could not resolve, when two cargo

handling firms ceased activity and laid off 180 registered dock

workers. This brought the surplus to 800 men, 18% of the labour

force.



Local employers, who were already employing far more labour than

they needed, refused a request from the local board to take on the

workers who had been laid off. The unions on the board insisted and

threatened an immediate local strike with the possibility of a national

strike, if local employers did not reconsider or if there was any move

to place the men on a Temporarily Unattached Register (TUR) on

basic pay.



The issue went to the National Board where the employers, under

threat of a national dock strike, agreed to give an undertaking

demanded by the unions that the TUR would not be used to reduce

surpluses in any circumstances.



The surplus workers were reallocated to the 10 remaining employers

in Liverpool. Most of these have since gone out of business.


The Cost of 3.8 Voluntary severances on the scale required have only been secure



Severances by inducing registered dock workers to leave the industry with



large cash payments. After an initial grant from the Government

these were financed by levies on registered employers. However,

from the early 1980s onwards the scale of severances became so

great as to require substantial Government loans and grants to the

industry. During 1988-89 the Government has been contributin

50% of severance payments to registered dock workers up to a

maximum of  25,000 per man, depending upon length of servic

Where a port employer ceases operations and de-registers the

Government is prepared to pay the full - 25,000.



3.9 In these ways the restrictive practices of registered dock workers

and their unions are being underwritten by the taxpayer. A total 0

over  420 million of public money has been paid for severances

since 1972, at today&apos;s prices, in addition to more than  125 milli

paid by port employers themselves. The ports of London and

Liverpool have also received  350 million in assistance to help

them survive the critical financial problems they faced in the earl

1980s. Where there is public investment in ports, the publi

has the right to expect every effort to organise employmeti

in a way which encourages an efficient business. The

Scheme acts against this by blocking the fundamental

improvements in efficiency needed to reduce reliance ont

taxpayer.

Effect on

cruitment



3.10Joint control over employment levels has produced fewer and fewer

jobs for local young people and unacceptable recruitment practices.

Port employers are not free to determine the numbers and

organisation of their registered dock workers and, faced with

persistent surpluses, have no incentive to recruit. The result is a

progressively ageing workforce which fails to provide the necessary

balance of experience and new recruitment needed for an efficient,

forward-looking industry. The average age of registered dock

workers rose from 42 years in 1973 to 47.1 years in 1988. In some

ports the average is now over 50. By contrast, in the economy as a

whole 70% of manual workers are under 45 years old.



3.11 When employers do decide to recruit they do not have a free hand

to choose on the basis of merit. First, they need the permission of a

local board and must accept any under-employed registered dock

workers from another port employer. If they are allowed to recruit

from the labour market the signs are that, in practice, their choice is

likely to be restricted. Of the 3,721 registered dock workers

recruited between 1970 and 1986 nearly half were the sons of

existing registered dock workers. In any other context, those

unions who seek to excuse these practices would find them

discriminatory and objectionable. The Scheme allows them to

flourish.



3.12 These recruitment practices can no longer be justified on grounds

of local tradition or unattractive pay levels. The average pay of a

registered dock worker in 1988 was nearly  350 for a 45 hour

week, well above the national average for manual workers and very

high by the standards of pay in the areas where many Scheme ports

are located.



19


Working 3.13 The definitions of work reserved for dockers in Scheme ports ste



Practices from wartime regulations, custom and practice. They often date,



literally, from the days of the horse and cart. In Bristol &quot;the raising

and maintaining of steam in boilers&quot; is still reserved for dockers;!

Hull &quot;the handling of pit wood&quot;. In Ardrossan, dock work is

defined by reference to &quot;horse and capstan movement&quot; and, in the

Medway, by the duties of crews of sailing barges. Those archaic

definitions can have real effect: they provide a means for defendin

overmanning in Scheme ports and preserving outdated organisati

of work. Change cannot take place without the agreement of the

unions. Their blocking vote on boards enables them to set a heav!

price.



3.14The Scheme creates a sheltered environment in which inefficient

and highly wasteful working practices can continue unchecked.

Terms enshrining these practices have passed into our language.

One common practice is known as &quot;bobbing&quot; or &quot;welting&quot;. The

jointly controlled local dock labour board determines the number

of men to be allocated to each employer but, because manning

standards are often too high, some men are able to &quot;bob off&quot; while

others do the work. &quot;Ghosting&quot; or &quot;stand-by&quot; arrangements have

also been well-publicised. They provide for specialised cargoes to

be handled by non-registered workers while registered dock

workers are also employed, at normal rates of pay, whether they

work or not. By requiring the permission of the local board-and

thus the union - before staff other than registered dock workersc

do the work, the Scheme encourages these damaging practices.

Case 2 illustrates how they not only lead to inefficiency - which

has lost Scheme ports business and jobs to their competitors outsid

the Scheme - but add to the costs borne by British industry and the

public alike.



20


Case 2: The Thames Barrier Gates



The gates for the Thames Barrier were built by a company on

Teesside. To get these large structures to London to be in place by

Autumn 1982 they had to be loaded on barges and towed down the

North Sea to the Thames. Weather conditions restricted the times of

the year when this could be done and special floating cranes had to be

hired from Holland to lift the gates from the barges into the barrier.

Loading the gates at the Cleveland Bridge works on Teesside was a

highly skilled job which only specialist staff could carry out. This

was accepted by all concerned. However under the wartime

definitions of dock work on the Tees this work appeared to be dock

work. As had become customary, the company requiring the work to

be done had to pay for a number of registered dock workers, though

they were not needed for the job.



In November 1981, however, the dockers employed by the Tees and

Hartlepool Ports Authority went on strike over a pay claim. That

meant that there were no dockers available to be paid to watch the

specialist employees load the barge. Had the specialists gone ahead,

their employer would have been liable to a criminal prosecution

brought by the National Dock Labour Board and the unions might

well have called national industrial action because of this breach of

the Scheme. The company decided not to move the gates but to

challenge through an Industrial Tribunal whether they were actually

covered by the Dock Labour Scheme. The precedents were not clear.

On 11 February 1982 they appealed for a hearing, and hearings began

in October.



Meanwhile the gates were strike-bound, the weather window was

closing and the crane hire period running out. London was

threatened with a further winter without adequate flood protection

because no dockers were available to be paid for work others were

doing. The installation of the gates had to be rescheduled at great

cost. On 1 March 1982 the strike was settled and loading began the

day after, several months late.



On 6 May 1983 an Industrial Tribunal found that loading the gates

was not after all registered dock work.


3.15 Bad working practices illustrate how the Scheme serves to

undermine a sense of individual responsibility for the success of

each port business. Registered dock workers have little incentive

perform well. Similarly, port employers have little incentive to se

improved working methods if these merely increase their

complement of registered dock workers who have little or nothin

to do.



3.16 Furthermore, employers have no real control over discipline. The

local boards, with their blocking union vote, and the Appeal

Tribunal they establish have the last word on all cases of suspensio

or dismissal for disciplinary reasons. In practice it is very difficult!

dismiss a registered dock worker. Between 1980 and 1986, of 122

workers dismissed by employers in 8 major Scheme ports, nofewei

than 100 were reinstated on appeal. In other words a dismissed

registered dock worker has five chances in six of getting his job

back. There are recorded cases of reinstatement where registered

dock workers have been convicted of criminal offences related to

their employment. If employers refuse to take back a worker

reinstated by the Board, they can be held to be in breach of the

Scheme, struck off the register of employers and prevented from

pursuing their business.



3.17 A combination of poorly-motivated employees and demoralised

management, to which the Scheme&apos;s disciplinary procedures and

manning arrangements give rise, is a recipe for the poor

performance of many Scheme ports. Case 3 shows how, in the

fishing industry, Scheme ports have declined as a direct result of

their failure to compete.


Case 3: Fishing Ports and the Scheme



By historical accident, Aberdeen, Fleetwood and Grimsby - alone

among fishing ports - were required by the 1947 Scheme to employ

registered dock workers in their fish docks.



Definitions of dock work at these ports are inconsistent. At

Aberdeen, all fish landing is covered; at Fleetwood, an Industrial

Tribunal decided in 1983 that inshore fishing vessels - most of the

boats which use the port - were not; at Grimsby, only small inshore

vessels under 60 feet are excluded.



Both Aberdeen and Grimsby have lost business and jobs to their

competitor ports of Peterhead and Hull respectively, where the

Scheme&apos;s restrictions do not apply to the fishing industry.



- Aberdeen lost over 20% of its business between 1977 and 1987

while Peterhead&apos;s increased by 84%, to twice that of Aberdeen.

Since then, Aberdeen&apos;s fish landing company, which once

employed 100 registered dock workers, has ceased trading because

it could not cover its costs, and a new company has proposed to

employ fewer than half that number of dockers;



-- Grimsby&apos;s fish landing company employed 60 registered dockers

until 1987 when it ceased trading because competition from Hull

meant it could not raise its charges to pay all 60 for periods when

there was no income from fish landings. The new company which

took over with 40 dockers, (20 having accepted voluntary

severance) has faced continuing disputes over pay and flexible

working needed to respond efficiently to peak demands. Catches

went to waste when the dock labour board was awarded an

injunction stopping crews from unloading their own vessels. That

injunction was lifted on 3 March 1989, when the Court decided

that the board should balance the needs of port users by allowing

the use of non-registered labour (as it can), against the risk of

escalating strikes by registered dock workers attempting to impose

their monopoly.


Industrial 3.18 Industrial relations in the docks were traditionally among the wq



Relations m British industry. Though they have shared in the greatly



improved record of recent years this cannot be credited to the Do|

Labour Scheme. Lord Devlin, in his first report on the Schemei

1956, observed that the principle of joint control had not led to

peace and satisfaction in the docks. By then there had already bee!

major dock strikes since the Scheme began. Subsequently there

have been several more and countless threats. Some strikes, as in

1972 and 1975 hit the economy as a whole. Others in 1984

threatened to do so. There have also been lengthy strikes at

Southampton, Tilbury and the Tees in the 1980s. The cumulati

effect has been to inflict serious damage on the ports industry,

which relies for its business on its reputation for reliability.



3.19 The Scheme has one especially harmful effect: it encourages the

union to raise the stakes in local disputes by threatening national

strike action. This magnifies the pressure on employers who sec

flexibility in the Scheme&apos;s application to local conditions. The

handling of local surpluses of labour illustrated by Case 1 is typi:

of the way in which disputes can escalate. Current difficulties

affecting the Clyde docks, which have led to a call for a nationa

strike, are described in Case 4.



3.20The guarantee of employment provided by the Scheme, couple

with the Aldington-Jones arrangements, takes away from

registered dock workers the need, which all other workers face,

consider the impact of strikes on their employers and their jobs.

Significantly, no national strike has arisen from a local disputei!

non-scheme ports: problems are resolved locally taking account

the business needs of the port, on which jobs depend. But non

scheme ports have been drawn into national disputes started in

Scheme ports, time and again.



3.21 All these factors have produced an industrial relations system in

Scheme ports which rewards extremism and is grossly out of step

with the needs of an efficient industry in the Britain of the

1990s.



24


Case 4: Dock Work On The Clyde



A dispute arose on the Clyde in May 1988 when the Sheppard Group

Ltd wanted to start exporting scrap metal from a quay at Scotstoun.

The Clyde Port Authority (CPA) considered Scotstoun to be within

the Scheme port of Glasgow, and had therefore made it a condition of

their licence to Sheppards to undertake this operation that Sheppards

should employ registered dock workers whom they (the CPA) would

supply. For operational and safety reasons Sheppards did not want

registered dock workers to undertake this work. They were prepared

to offer a token rate of pay to the registered dock workers who would

be detailed for it but would not actually do it, but agreement could

not be reached on a rate. The company went ahead with the loading

of ships using its own non-registered employees. The CPA and the

National Dock Labour Board unsuccessfully sought interim interdicts

in the Scottish Courts to prevent this action, on the grounds that the

company was in breach of its licence and of the Dock Labour Scheme.



In December, two other longer-established scrap metal dealers on the

Clyde to whom the CPA had regularly supplied registered dock workers

claimed that their operations were being undercut by Sheppards and

refused to accept their allocation of registered dock labour. The

60 or so Glasgow dockers went on strike. The strike was halted when

the CPA obtained an interim interdict against the leaders of the

Glasgow dockers, restraining them from encouraging strike action.

But the TGWU called a national conference of dock delegates on 21

December, who voted in favour of a ballot for a national dock strike.



A few days later the National Dock Labour Board was granted an

interim interdict preventing the two longer-established scrap metal

dealers from using non -registered labour to handle cargo on board

ships in Glasgow docks. No strike ballot has been held.



The situation in the port remains confused: registered dock workers

are working on board ships, but not on the quayside. The National

Dock Labour Board has appealed to the Court of Session against the

refusal to grant them an interdict against Sheppards, and has also

applied to an industrial tribunal to decide whether the Sheppards

operation is or is not dock work within the meaning of the Scheme.


The Impact on 3.22 Excessive labour costs, wasteful working practices and poor



Business and industrial relations all reduce the flow of trade through Schem;



Jobs ports, cutting jobs in dock work and reducing investment,



enterprise and employment in surrounding areas. The Scheme

obstacles to efficiency are manifestly unattractive to port custo

and potential investors.



(a) They add to the costs of port employers, raising port chars

and reducing investment. The National Association ofPo

Employers estimates that the administration of the Schem!

labour surpluses, and the hidden costs of the labour practic

such as &quot;ghosting&quot; may have added over 20% to the total  

bill of Scheme ports in 1986. The ports pay with their bus1

and jobs; the nation pays for higher port charges in the pric

the goods it consumes and exports.



(b) They sustain restrictive labour practices and encourage stri

which damage the reputation of Scheme ports for providin

reliable service. Reliability is central to port work. Case 2

shows how the Scheme allows unions to use their monopo

dock work to penalise employers and customers alike.



(c) They depress investment in port related activities in areas

covered by the Scheme, many of which are in inner city are

notably London, Liverpool, Glasgow, and Hull. The Sche

restrictions apply to thousands of acres of land, parts ofwhi

have long been derelict as loss of business and changing

methods of shipping and handling cargo have reduced the

number of berths needed. Within those areas registered do

workers can claim as theirs any work related to the handlin

goods which pass through the port. Even if it is not dock  

it may take months (as Case 2 shows) for a court to establis

that. Case 5 shows how the bureaucratic delays and disput

caused by the Scheme&apos;s provisions are depriving those areas

investment and jobs. Small businesses - our greatest source

potential employment - are especially reluctant to accepttl

Scheme&apos;s constraints. A study* commissioned by the port

employers estimated that nearly 50,000jobs might be creat

in Scheme areas without its restrictions. Where jobs have!)

created in Scheme port areas - in London&apos;s Docklands for

example - they have been in activities unrelated to port wo

In areas which have the potential to develop as ports, newj

in port related work, drawing on locally available skills, are

being denied to local people because of the Scheme&apos;s

restrictions and their discouragement of investment.



3.23 The growth of business and jobs in ports outside the Scheme,

described in preceding Chapters, illustrates the potential which

exists if ports are free to exploit business opportunities

unconstrained by the Scheme.

Case 5: Southampton Free Trade Zone



Early in 1984 Southampton was designated by the Government as

one of the six experimental freeports to encourage trade and jobs. A

31 acre site was earmarked, covering old dock warehouses in the

port&apos;s Western Docks. The operating company, Southampton Free

Trade Zone Ltd, was set up and the first phase was ready for

operation in August 1984.



The Transport and General Workers Union claimed that the freeport

was part of the normal docks and the registered dock workers should

therefore do recognised work within the freeport area. The operating

company wanted to be free to hire its own choice of labour. The

dispute was not settled until 31 October 1985, a 15 month delay. The

basis of the agreement was that the operating company would employ

its own labour: 50% registered dock workers taken from the port and

50% non-dockers hired from outside the port.



The industrial dispute was an important factor in two decisions since

taken by the operating company - not to develop the original zone

any further, because to do so would involve a further costly dispute

with the registered dock workers, and to relocate the zone altogether

outside the port area.


CHAPTER 4



Proposals for Change



A New Beginning     4.1 Employment and working practices in Dock Labour Scheme po



urgently need reform. Competition for cargo handling business

increasingly intense. At the same time greater opportunities are

opening up with the completion of the Single European Market,

Scheme ports cannot ignore these challenges if they are to remai

viable.



4.2 The present framework of employment law in the docks origina

over 40 years ago. It was designed to meet problems which dated

back to the 19th century and it echoed strongly the compulsory

regulations of the war years.



4.3 The situation today bears no comparison with those times. The

nature of ports business, its technology and working conditions

have each undergone a revolution. A far-reaching system of

employment protection law, guaranteeing employee rights, has

been established over the economy as a whole. The importance 0

flexible management and working arrangements for business

success - on which jobs ultimately depend - is now much better

understood.



4.4 Scheme ports deserve a new beginning to help them face this

demanding future with confidence. Outdated institutions and

attitudes can only hinder their progress.



4.5 The number of registered dock workers has declined steadily fro

a post-war peak of over 82,000 in 1951, to 27,000 in 1979 and

down to 9,400 today. And today&apos;s 140 operational registered port

employers compare with over 1,500 in the 1950s. But those figu

do not imply that the Scheme can be left to wither away of its ow

accord.



28


Iieme Ports:

ital Asset



4.6 For a start, while the Scheme exists, cargo cannot be handled in

Scheme ports by people other than registered dock workers. So the

Scheme cannot wither away unless and until every Scheme port

closes. That is a highly improbable outcome on any reasonable

timescale and also highly undesirable. It would involve abandoning

major deep-water ports, with all their natural advantages of

location and tidal waters, fixed assets, and the linked infrastructure,

like roads and railways, which have been provided at public

expense. Great ports like London, Liverpool, Southampton, Hull,

and Bristol would have to die completely, along with many other

ports in Scotland, South Wales, the North East and the Medway.

The impact on local business, all round the country, would be

devastating, while the nation as a whole would lose some of its

prime assets and the investment of many years. Moreover, these

ports could never re-open without being drawn back into the

Scheme at once.



4.7 Less dramatically, withering away might imply simply a



continuation of the long-term decline in employment in Scheme

ports to a point where the Scheme itself could be regarded as

insignificant. But that too is hard to envisage. The decline in

numbers has occurred largely as a result of the major changes in

cargo handling techniques and in the UK&apos;s trading patterns.

Scheme ports still handle 70% of our trade. Though scope remains

for improvements in manpower productivity, further reductions in

numbers must have some limit so long as the ports continue to

operate. And since 40% of registered dock workers are aged over

50, new recruits will be needed shortly to replace retiring men,

thereby perpetuating the Scheme.



iding the Scheme&apos;s 4 8 Positive action is therefore needed to free Scheme ports from the

iStrictions artificial constraints which bind them and which apply in no other



British industry. The simple aim is to bring all port employers and

dock workers into exactly the same position as other employers and

workers in respect of their rights and duties under employment law

generally.



4.9 The only way in which this can be effectively achieved is through

the abolition of the Dock Labour Scheme. The registered dock

workers&apos; main union, the Transport and General Workers Union

(TGWU), has made clear that it is not prepared to negotiate new

arrangements to replace the Scheme. Its amendment or restriction

would not remedy present defects and would merely create new

problems. The Government therefore proposes to introduce a Bill

at once to repeal all the existing legislation connected with the

Scheme.



29


An Orderly Change 4.10 Abolition of the Scheme will bring to an end the role of the



National Dock Labour Board, including its control of the dock

workers and employers&apos; registers. However, not all the changesc

be made as suddenly as that. The Board is responsible for a range

other tasks, such as the provision of welfare and medical services

and the training of registered dock workers. These are best dealt

with on a port by port basis or by employers individually. Effects

new arrangements cannot all be decided and put in place at once:

they are best left for the employers and workers in the industry to

determine.



4.11 The proposed legislation will therefore keep the Board inbeingi

a limited period for the purposes only of securing an orderly

transfer of its functions and then winding up its affairs, including

the disposal of its various premises. The Government will assist

financially, for example by meeting redundancy payments due to

Board staff and by meeting any deficit outstanding when its assets

are disposed of.



A New Redundancy 4.12 As soon as the Bill is enacted, every dock worker will acquire allt

Compensation normal employment protection rights, such as the right not to be



Scheme unfairly dismissed, which are available to other workers. The



proposals of this White Paper should provide a sound basis for

employment for the vast majority of dock workers. However, any

who are made redundant from former Scheme ports in the 3 years

following abolition will have the right to payments far higher th

those which apply under normal statutory redundancy

arrangements.



4.13 Past practice in Scheme ports, and the expectations this has

generated, justify such a special provision. Because of the

inflexibilities of the Scheme and the Aldington-Jones

recommendations, existing surpluses of registered dock workers

can be reduced only if individual workers volunteer to take

severance. Large financial inducements have been required, at gre

cost to the employers and taxpayer. Given the legal and industrial

circumstances, Governments have thought it right to share those

costs on terms agreed with the National Association of Port

Employers. Under the most recent arrangement the Government

and the individual employer concerned have each contributed 50

of severance payments up to a maximum of  25,000 for each

registered dock worker who volunteers to leave the industry.



30


4.14 Ending these arrangements abruptly and without notice would be

costly to the employers and harsh on dock workers. The

Government therefore proposes to introduce, for a transitional

period of 3 years, statutory severance arrangements for any former

registered dock workers who may be made redundant after the

Scheme is abolished. The details will be set out in regulations.

Under these arrangements dockers will be statutorily entitled to a

maximum payment of  35,000 after 15 years of service, if they are

made redundant in the 18 months following the end of the

Scheme, and  20,000 during the subsequent 18 months.

Thereafter, dock workers, like all other employees, will be covered

by the ordinary statutory redundancy scheme. The cost of statutory

payments under the arrangements will be shared equally between

the Government and the individual employer concerned.



31


CHAPTER 5



Conclusion : An Agenda for Action



5.1 The central concern of this White Paper is with the future of

Britain&apos;s ports industry.



Removing the 5.2 A fresh approach to employment in Scheme ports is now a pre-



Barriers to Change condition for their success in meeting competition from other



in Britain, on the continent and from the Channel Tunnel, andi

grasping opportunities for growth. That success will also contri

to the success of all port users engaged in overseas trade and hen

to the British economy at large. Without major changes in

working practice and attitudes the industry cannot hope to reali

fully the vision that many share of continued growth and

development, particularly as we progress towards completing th

Single European Market in 1992.



5.3 The Government has the duty to remove obstacles to the efficie

working of markets, especially the labour market, on which jobs

ultimately depend. The Dock Labour Scheme represents an

outstanding case of such an obstacle that has now outlived the

circumstances of its birth. It is a damaging anachronism, totally

odds with the Government&apos;s policies for deregulation and

competition that are proving so effective in other areas of the

economy. It is irrelevant for employment conditions and the

prospects of workers in Scheme ports. It is no longer needed to

deal with the former problem of casual working. And it serves to

undermine efficiency and responsible industrial relations. Noth

short of abolition of the Dock Labour Scheme will free the port

employers and their workers to adjust to the demands of today.



5.4 Abolition of the Scheme is also essential if the ports are to take f?

advantage of their new opportunities for growth. It will offer sc

and incentive for the regeneration of inner cities where many 01

ports are located. It will open the way to the modernisation and

expansion of the most favourably located and enterprising ports

the redevelopment of others, with other forms of business, hous

or leisure activities in mind. All that will favour jobs.



5.5 In giving up their uniquely privileged position today&apos;&gt; registered

dock workers will acquire, at the same time, all the employment

rights enjoyed by other port workers and workers in all other

industries. They will additionally qualify for generous redundat

terms for a transitional period of 3 years, while the industry adj

to its new freedoms and responsibilities.



32


5.6 The Government expects these reforms to provide the basis for a

competitive and prosperous ports industry, serving the needs of

Britain&apos;s growing economy and producing, through its success, the

wealth to sustain good employment conditions for its employees.

The Government looks to port employers, dock workers and their

union representatives to respond now by establishing the improved

working practices and encouraging the attitudes which will be

needed if the industry is to rise to the tough challenges of Europe&apos;s

single market of the 1990s and beyond.
