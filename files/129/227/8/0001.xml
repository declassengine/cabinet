1989 RJBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY

Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury



This fSjB^eports the outcome of my bilateral discussions with

collea^^^jgiich have been conducted, within the remit agreed

by Cabinq^umTuly, on the basis of the new definition of the



planning

THE CABINET



2. Cabinet^^Afl that the top priority was to defeat



inflation, and th^|^!  objectives for the Survey should be:



to maintain the downward trend in general government

expenditure (excluding privatisation proceeds) as a

proportion of GDP;



to stick as close l^^^gible to existing plans.

PROGRESS IN BILATERAIS



3. At the start of the bila%^^^ the bids totalled seme

 13 billion for 1990-91, rising to  17 jbillion and  23 billion

for the later two years. Within thq#e totals, we were already

cemmitted to increases in 1990-91 of W^fe4 billion.



4. The table at Annex A records the^^Wlements I have

reached with colleagues.   Annex   provides a brief description

RUNNING COSTS AND MANPOWER



8. Running costs settlements inply increased spending on



the Civil Service of 9^/2 P *&quot; oent in cash (4.3 per cent in real

terms) between this year and next.   Though markedly lcwer than

the bids, this is a higher percentage increase than in recent

years, because rising provision for pay and new initiatives is

not fully offset by efficiency improvements.   The cash increases

for 1951-92 and 1992-93 are 5 per cent and 41/2 cent.



departments have reached three-year settlements

armed efficiency gains averaging 2 per cent a year,

igures for most large executive departments. I

les to ensure that their departments&apos; efficiency

fully monitored and wherever possible exceeded,

we shall need to examine the outcome.



manpower will remain well below 600,000.



1989-90 OUTTURN



11.       The planning total for 1989-90 was set, on the old

definition, at  167.1 billion.   This included a Reserve of  3.5

billion.   The estimated outturn is new  168.2 billion.

Expected claims on the Re^^^total seme  4.6 billion; within

this, additional expenditAe^ulocal authorities looks likely

to account for seme  23/4 billion, lower privatisation proceeds



seme  J/4 billion and pubic

higher than on rate rebates. The net effect of changes in

 ^Particularly in the third year. Ten new measures have already

\4&gt;3jC announced, helping h million sick and disabled people and

^SJrs, costing  100 million in a full year. The longer term

imgtfE^ however, will be to constrain the growth in spending on

the^^Jknefits as a result of the decisions to end the reduced

earnings allowance and to phase out the additional pension paid

with invalidity benefit. These increases are offset in part by

the effects of lower unemployment. Estimating changes in the

first two ya^^ also show savings. In addition, the Secretary of

State has al^|liik?-ded to find savings through not uprating Child
