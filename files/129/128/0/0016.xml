c- oC(67) 16 COPY NO.8th February, 1967CABINETSTATUTORY POWERS FOR PRICES AND INCOMESMemorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic affairs have considered further in the light of our discussion on 2nd February and of consultations with the Trades Union Congress(TUC) and Confederation of British Industry (CBI) the possible nature and form of the further statutory powers which we might seek in orderto ensure that the effectiveness of the prices and incomes policy is notdestroyed by the actions of an unco-operative minority among employersand trade unions.    I attach at Annex A a note discussing the issues involved in devising legislation for this purpose.    I also attach at annex B for information a summary of the existing powers in Parts and IV of the Prices and Incomes Act.2.       There is a fundamental difference between powers of the Part IItype, which are designed solely to delay implementation of a pay or price increase for a short time while it is examined by the Government or theNational Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) and powers which are designed to prevent unco-operative elements on either side of industry from acting in breach of the policy and thereby undermining its generalacceptability and effectiveness,    I see no escape from the fact that powers for this latter purpose would need to be drawn in pretty wideterms and would be closer in their general nature to the present powers in Part IV than to those in Part II.3.       On the other hand, there are various ways in which the Governmentcould alter the form of the powers and so limit the use to which they couldbe put.     The most effective limitation would be to confine the exerciseof the powers to the enforcement of recommendations by the NBPI.     Thiswould have drawbacks as well as advantages, as described in paragraphs9 and 10 of Annex A,    Other safeguards which could be offered aresuggested in paragraph 12 of Annex A,Views of the CBI4,       My discussions with the CBI were no more than provisional since they made it clear that they had themselves reached no firm views andwould need time to give full consideration to the Governments views.The principal objective of the CBI is to minimise Government intervention in industrial matters.     They fear that once the Government had statutory powers going beyond those in Part II it would be obliged to use them onan increasingly wide scale.     The CBI is therefore opposed to further legislation in this field.     On the other hand I formed the view that the document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)
SECRETCBI might not necessarily react violently against proposals to seek freshstatutory powers, if these were hedged around with substantial safeguards.They seem to put greatest importance on the interposition of some independent body between the Government and the exercise of the powers.Views of the TUC5.       If anything the TUC are even more strongly opposed to government intervention in the field of collective bargaining than the CBI.     They havealready circulated a statement to Executives of affiliated unions statingtheir view that when Part IV of the Act lapses in August it should not be renewed or replaced by any similar provisions and that it is neithernecessary nor desirable to implement Part II,    Not surprisingly, there-fore, when I met them, they expressed their opposition to the various proposals I put forward, partly on the grounds that they would not inpractice have the desired effect and partly on the grounds that theywould be unacceptable to the unions.    While they will be giving furtherconsideration to these suggestions, they left me in little doubt that themajority of the General Council will be strongly opposed to proposals to seek further statutory powers.conclusions,       Taking into account the position of the CBI and more particularly of the TUC, I conclude that, although some new powers will be needed,they must be drawn - and exercised - with great care.    We can reasonably hope for a good deal of general public support for powersgoing significantly beyond the present Part II, but we must not go too far ahead of public opinion.7.      Nonetheless, it is clear that the pressures to which the policyof restraint will be exposed after 30th June will be too great for us todeal with effectively if we have to depend only on the simple delayingpowers of Part II for the reasons given in C(67) 13.    Here I v/ould drawmy colleagues attention to the prospective increases in pay in the second half of 1967 summarised in Annex C.    It is not possible, of course, toindicate prospective increases in prices in this way, but we must expectthere to be renewed pressure on prices even allowing for the effects ofthe lower level of demand compared with the period before July, 1966.8.       Neither the TUC nor the CBI have been able to give us realassurance that they would be able to deal effectively by their own arrangements and influence with breaches of the policy.     Much aswe need to involve the CBI and TUC in the operation of the policy, itwould be too great a risk to move into the period after 30th June withnothing more to buttress the policy than a simple delaying power.9.       My conclusion is, therefore, that the right course would befor us to seek the powers described in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Annex Abut to limit their use to enforcement of recommendations by the national board for Prices and Incomes after the latter ls independent examinationof prices and pay cases.M.S.Department of Economic Affairs, S. V/, 1.8th February, 1967
ANNEX ATHE NATUloTl i&apos;J&apos;3) FORK OF ADDITIONAL STATUTORY P0\7BIISThis note discusses the possible forms of statutory powers relatingto prices and incomes which night be taken in notification of or additionto those contained in Parts I and II of the Prices and Incomes Act, 1966.Simple Extension of Delaying Powors2.     Part II in its present form provides a maximum statutory early warningperiod of thirty days (during which a price increase or pay settlement whichhas to be notified nay not be implemented without Government approval) and afurther maximum period of three months delay (making a total maximum delay of four months) in those cases which are referred to the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI) for examination.     It should he noted that -(i)   These powers were not Intended to impose delay for its own sake,hut are related to references to the NBPI.(ii)   Although there is power to refer to NBPI price or pay proposalsof which statutory advance notification is not required, thereis no power to stop their implementation before a reference ismade.     In other words the pe^rties nay he able to &quot;jump the gun&quot;,and cannot he prevented from doing so unless the net of compulsorynotification is spread very wide,(iii)   In cases referred to the NBPI the parties are free to do what theylike after the Board&apos;s report has been published.     The onlysanction is that of public opinion.     There is no power to preventthe parties implementing the original proposals with retrospectiveeffect.3.     It would he possible simply to extend the maximum periods in Part II,for example the early warning period from thirty to sixty days and thetemporary standstill period pending the Board&apos;s examination from three months to say six months.     This could be presented as consistent with the originalconcept of Part II, because the maximum periods at present laid down are notgenerous (even though the CBI and TUC thought them too long).     But Part IIpowers, even in this extended form, could not be presented as enabling theGovernment to deal with the selfish minority.     Although there might be some advantage in providing the Government and the Board more time in which toconsider particular proposals, it seems doubtful whether this would hesufficient to justify the introduction of amending legislation.CDSECRET
Powers to delay and to prevent retrospection4-.     A longer extension of the maximum period of delay - soy to nine ortwelve months - would have three weaknesses -(i)   It could hardly &quot;be presented as consistent with the original purpose of imposing a standstill simply to admit examination&quot;by tho Board, but would be clearly seen as the imposition of delay for its own sake and thus as a departure from the originalprinciples on which Part II was founded,(ii)   The powers would present no effective defence against challengeby a selfish minority if they did not enable the G-overnment toprevent increases from being introduced with retrospectiveeffecto     Admittedly a delay of up to twelve months in the implementation of a price or pay increa.se could be of somepermanent benefit, even without such powers, particularly Inthe case of prices where retrospective increases are not usually possible.     And It might help to support confidenceoverseas but it would be unrealistic to suppose that in allcases the opportunity for unions to demand or employers to concede retrospective payment would be voluntarily foregone(tho electrical contracting industry might well be a case in point).     Moreover, unless retrospective payments were barred,employers would remain liable to legal action for recovery ofarrears of pay where they had entered into contractual obliga-tions to increase pay.      (Difficulties on this score have arisen in relation to the present Part IV and it may be necessary toconsider some form of indemnification of employers who would otherwise bo liable for up to six years after Part IV lapses.)(iii)   As explained in paragraph 2 above the present form of Part IImakes it possible to &quot;jump the gun&quot; unless the net of compulsorynotification is spread very wide.Nature of the powers needed5.     There appears to be no way in which the real recalcitrants who were unwilling voluntarily to observe the requirements of prices and incomes policy could be dealt with unless the powers were of such a nature as to overcome these weaknesses.     It would be unrealistic to expect the majorityto continue to support tho policy if selfish minorities could at the end ofthe day receive pay increases or impose price increases which had beenjudged to be inconsistent with the policy. .   The minimum powers necessaryfor this purpose would seem to be -.Prices(a)   Power to postpone a proposed increase in price, wholly or Inpart, for up to /twelve/7 months.(2)
(b)   Power to require a reduction for up to  twelve/ months of aprice even if no increa.se had been proposed but where thocriteria for price reductions were found to apply.(a) Power to postpone a proposed increase in pay, wholly or in part,for up to /^twelve/ months.(b) Power to prevent retrospective payment of an increase which hadbeen postponed.6.     One further point would be for consideration.     A combination of thepowers in Part II together with those described in paragraph 5 above wouldnot ensure that price or pay increases were subject to a standstill pendingexamination by the NBPI.     Even if the Government had imposed compulsorynotification of proposed increases on a wide scale, some determined groupsnight well put thoir increases into effect.     This situation could be remedied only if the Government had power to require reversion of prices orpay to the previous levels.     Otherwise the NBPI would be put in the difficult position of examining cases for increases Which already applied.The exercise of this power vrould, of course, have to bo available at theGovernment&apos;s own hand but it could be subject to confirmation by the NBPI.&apos; :    &apos;       :    1        &apos; -    &apos;       - &apos;      ... .   . &apos;    -      &apos; - . .........7.     Those are wide-reaching powers.     Indeed, the general power to require a price reduction under paragraph 5(i)(b) above goes wider than Part IV,where there is power only to require reversion of a price which has been increased since 20th July 1966 to the level charged before 20th July.     Butit is central to the price objectives of the policy to seek for price reductions even where prices have not been increased a.nd the lack of such a power would leave the Government wholly dependent on the pressure of publicopinion deriving from the recommendations of thetNBPI or on the MonopoliesLegislation where monopoly conditions applied,Ejaf_ojrcencj.it of NBPI recommendations.    while the powers described in paragraphs 5-6 above would be most effective if they were exercised freely by the Government without the backingof the NBPI, their use could probably be made more acceptable if it were limited by statute to the enforcement of recommendations by the NBPI.     Ananalogy exists in the powers in the Monopolies and Mergers Act, 1965 toenable the President of the Board of Trade to require compliance with the monopolies Commission&apos;s recommendations.(3)SECRET
advantages of this course night bo -Public opinion nay well be influenced considerably by the reportsof an independent body and it nay be easier to got across the issues involved for the national interest.This course would take sone of the sting out of the charge thatthe Government want to be free to &quot;interfere&quot; with a considerable part of the field of collective bargaining.Interposition of the NBPI between the G-overnnent and the exerciseof new statutory powers would represent an inportant practicallimitation on their use.     However large the NBPI became, itwould not be precticablo to refer to it every case which nightraise the cpiestion of using powers, particularly in casesinvolving snail nunbers of employees or of minor economic importance.10.   There would on the other hand be disadvantages -(i)   There would probably be some occasions when the Board&apos;srecommendations were not acceptable to the G-government and insuch cases the Government would have no effective powers at its disposal.(ii)   There would probably bo some occasions when the circumstances ofthe case were so clear cut that examination by the NBPI was not strictly necessary.     The G-overnncnt would nevertheless have torefer the case to the Board if it judged that use of the powers(other than the simple delaying power) would be necessary.     Insome cases, the tine taken by the Board in reporting night Itselfprovoke sone form of industrial action wheroas a swift decision by the G-overnnont to use their po?.ers night prevent this,(iii)   The power to enforce the Board&apos;s recommendations would be boundover tine to alter the character of ,the Board&apos;s work and of itsreports.     Much of Its work so far has deliberately been conducted in a rather informal manner.     It has not, for example,sat in public or published the evidence supplied to it.     Thishas helped the Board to act quickly and to obtain views and information which more formal procedures might not have revealed.Statutory power to enforce the Board&apos;s recommendations would bring pressure for a more judicial approach which might tend to turn the Boar*&amp; into something more like an arbitration tribunal.It would also be likely to undermine the effectiveness of theBoard&apos;s long-term or structural recommendations.(4)SECRET
11,   A suggestion has been nade that sone independent body other than the nbpi and more judicial in character should be interposed between theGovernment and the exercise of powers.     It seems very doubtful -whether thiswould he satisfactory.     The issues which would have to be decided beforeusing powers are basically economic and political and are not appropriate for a judicial or quasi-judicial body to determine.     It is difficult toholieve that there is room for two independent bodies in this field.Certainly the creation of a new body would do great damage to the standingof the NBPI.Safeguards on the exercise of powers12.   Whether or not the Governments exercise of powers was tied toenforcement of NBPI recommendations it would be possible to devise safeguards which would go significantly further than those which were included in thepresent Part IV -(a) The new powers could he made subject to annual renewal byParliament and the Government could he required to consult the cbi and TUC before seeking renewal each year (as it doubtlesswould in practice In any event).(b) The Government could also be required to consult the CBI and TUC(&quot;employers&quot; and &quot;unions&quot;) before exercising the powers in each individual case.     This safeguard was not included in Part IV,although the Government has in practice committed itself to suchprior consultation.     Although this would entail some limitation on the speed with which the Government could act against breaches of the policy, a requirement to consult might help to secure theco-operation of the CBI and TUC and stimulate them to use suchinfluence as they nay have on the parties immediately concerned.(c) As in the case of Part IV, the Government could he required togive the immediate parties concerned proper notice of intentionto exercise the powers and to consider representations.Sanctions13.   Every effort was made in the preparation of the Prices and Incomes Actto limit the risk of union officials or employees being imprisoned for offences under the Act.     The penalties for offences involving pay increases were applied to the employer.     But it was necessary to provide in sectionsection 16(A) of the Act for penalties against industrial action.     This wasnot done simply to be sure that employers breaching the policy would not beahle to plead that they had done so under duress, but because in the absenceof section 16(4-) it would not have been possible to give unions the protectionof section 16(5).     Without this protection, unions and workers would have beeiexposed to the grave consequences of action for criminal conspiracy or action for civil damages without limit on liability.(5)SECRET
14.   The only penalties on unions or workers provided in the Act are fines.Although refusal to pay fines could, of course, lead to imprisonment, the criminal Justice Bill will reduce (but not eliminate) the risk of imprison-ment for non-payment of fines.15.    In connection with the issue of sanctions, it has boon suggested thatif some way could be found of operating the prices and incomes policy onthe prices, side alone, the danger would be reduced of action against unions and workers including the risk of &quot;martyrdom&quot; through imprisonment for refusing to pay a fine.     In theory, this might be done by using the power to preventprice increases to ensure that no employer could implement a pay increaseout of line with the policy.16.   This seems to be a difficult course, not only on economic grounds butalso in terms of the pra.cticability of relating price increases to thegenuine effect on costs of given levels of pay without a considerableapparatus of oversight and inspection.     There would also be problems in preparing legislation on this basis in a form likely to be enforceable.17.   It seems in any case doubtful whether this course would solve theG-overnment&apos;s problems in relation to the unions.     If there were officialor unofficial industrial action to induce or compel an employer to pay anincrease which involved the employer in a price increase which theGovernment had forbidden, the employer could presumably plead in mitigationthat his breach of the order was committed under the duress of industrial action.     It Is true that employers might find it difficult to convince theCourt that their only course was to increase prices rather than to reduceprofits, but there could well be cases where the Court was satisfied on this score.     In this event, the Court might regard the breach as one whichcertainly should not attract a heavy fine on the employer.     In some casesat least the employer might find himself in a position to bring an actionagainst a union or group of workers for criminal conspiracy or civil damages.(6)SECRET
1.PRICES AND INCOMES ACTPowers in Parts II and IVPart II of the Prices and Incomes Act, which has not yet been broughtinto operation; contains reserve powers to give statutory reinforcement,insofar as this should prove necessary, to the voluntary &quot;early 7/arning&quot;system for prices and incomes.   Part IV of the Act, which was brought intooperation on 6th October 1966, contains reserve powers to give statutoryreinforcement, insofar as this should be necessary, to the voluntarystandstill on prices and incomes announced on 20th July.   These powerslapse automatically on 11th August 1967, twelve months after the royal assent,   The powers in each of these two parts of the Act are described below.Part II2,     These powers can only be brought into force by Order in Council fora period not exceeding twelve months, although at the end of the perioda further Order in Council may be made.   The Government is obliged to consult with representatives of management and unions before either a firstor a subsequent Order in Council is made, and the Order has to be approved in draft by both Houses of Parliament.   The Order in Council may bring into operation either the powers relating to prices, charges and dividendsor the powers relating to pay claims, awards and settlements, or both.3.     The main powers in Part II may be summarised briefly as follows -Notification of proposals to increase   prices and charges(a) Section 7 gives power to require advance notification, or&quot;early warning&quot;, of price increases of such goods or service as may be specified by order.   The price of such goods and services may not be increased during a period of thirty days after notification.Temporary stand stills on -prices and charges pending oxaininationby NBPI(b) Section 7 also gives power to delay, for a period of up to three months, the implementation of priee proposals whichhave been notified in accordance with (a) and which theGovernment decide to refer to the NBPI.   In such cases themaximum period of delay could be four months (including the thirty days in (a)).
(c) Section 8 gives power to delay, for a period of up to threemonths, the implementation of price proposals of which advancenotification has not &quot;been required   under section 7, hut whichare referred to the NBPI,Notification of dividend increases(d) Section 12 gives power to require notification of increases in the distributions of such companies as may be specified by order,    (There is no provision for temporary standstillson dividend proposals.)  &quot;&quot;Notification of pay claims(e) Section 13 gives power to require notification of claimspresented on behalf of such groups of employees as may be specified by order.    (There is no provision for temporarystandstills on pay claims.)Notification of pay awards and settlements(f) Section 14 gives power to require advance notification of awardsand settlements covering such groups of employees as may be specified by order.   Such awards and settlements may not be implemented during a period of thirty days after notification.Temporary stand stills on awards and settlements pending examination by NBPI(g) Section 14 also gives power to delay, for a period of up to three months, the implementation of awards and settlementswhich have been notified under this section and which theGovernment decide to refer to the NBPI.   In such cases themaximum period of delay could be four   months (including the thirty days advance notification).(h) Section 15 gives power to delay, for a period of up to threemonths, the implementation of awards and settlements of whichadvance notification has not been required under section 14but which are referred to the NBPI.4.     All these powers relate to references to the NBPI.   The powers torequire advance notification are designed to enable the Government toconsider whether particular proposals to increase prices, pay claims orsettlements should be referred to the Board.   They are not designed toimpose delay for its own sake.   The maximum delay of four months in the implementation of price or pay proposals applies only where advancenotification has been required by order and the case is referred to the nbpi for examination.   A maximum delay of three months may be imposed incases of which advance notification has not been required but which are referred to the NBPI only if the price or pay increase has not been2.
implemented at the time the reference is made.   Thus to he sure of preventing parties from &quot;jumping the gun&quot; and implementing price or payproposals before the G-overnment had been able to decide whether or not they should be examined by the NBPI, it would be necessary to spread thenet of compulsory notification very widely,5.     Finally, it should be noted that the delay of three or four monthsas the case may be in the implementation of a pay award or settlementrelates to the actual payment of the money and not to the date of theincrease,   There is nothing to stop the parties from implementing theaward or settlement from a retrospective date after the NBPI has reported.Nor is there any indemnity   for employers who refuse to implement asettlement from the date originally agreed, In accordance with recommenda-tions of the Board, but who fail to secure the agreement of the union to alater operative date.   Thus the only sanction at the end of the day whenthe Board has reported is the sanction of public opinion.Part IV6,     The powers in Part IV of the Act could only be brought Into force byOrder in Council for the remainder of the period of twelve months after theAct was passed and cannot be renewed.   The Order in Council required theapproval of both Houses of Parliament within thirty days.7.     The main powers in Part IV may be summarised briefly as follows -Power to prevent increases in prices and charges(i)   Section 26 gives power to prevent any increase in the prices ofsuch goods or services as may be specified by order from thedate the order comes into operation.Power to require prices and charges to be no higher than on 20th July(j)    Section 27 gives power to require the price of such goods or services as may be specified by order to be no higher than thelevel prevailing on 20th July 1966, or some intermediate levelbetween that prevailing on 20th July and the date the ordercomes into operation.   A statutory period of notice of at leastfourteen days is required.Power to prevent increases in pay(k)   Section 28 gives povrer to prevent any increase in pay(including an increase following reduction in normal hours ofwork) of such employees as may be specified in the order fromthe date the order comes into operation.3.
Power to require pay to be no higher than on 20th July(l)   Section 29 gives power to require the level of pay of suchemployees as may he specified by order to he no higher thanthe level prevailing on 20th July, or some intermediate level between that prevailing on 20th July and the date theorder comes into operation,   A statutory period of noticeof at least fourteen days is required.Power to defer the operation of statutory wage regulation orders(m)    Sections 31 and 32 give power to defer the effective date oforders embodying statutory minimum wage proposals by wages councils or by Agricultural Wages Boards.8.     All these powers relate to specific increases whioh have occurred since 20th July 1966 or which may occur during the remainder of the periodPart IV is in force.   The powers in (i) and (l) above enable the Governmentboth to require price or pay levels which have been increased since20th July to he put down to the level ruling at that date and to preventfurther increases from the date of the order.    Since the povrers can onlyoperate for a maximum of twelve months (in practice ten months sincePart IV was not activated until 6th October) their effect Is to defernot only the actual payment but the effective date of an increase for thisperiod only.   The repayment of money which has already been paid outbefore an order has been made cannot however be required.Sanctions9.     The sanctions under Part II of the Act are as follows.   Employersfailing to notify increases in dividends or pay awards or settlements areliable to a maximum fine of  50 on summary conviction.   Both trade unions and employers are liable to a similar penalty for failing to notify pay claims.10.   The penalty for employers failing to notify a price increase or for implementing a price increase whilst this is forbidden under Part II of theAct is a maximum fine of  100 on summary conviction, or a maximum fine of 500 on conviction on indictment except in the case of bodies corporatewhere no limit is specified.   Employers who implement a pay award orsettlement whilst this is forbidden under Part II are liable to a similarpenalty.   In addition trade unions or employees who seek to &quot;compel,induce or influence&quot; an employer to implement an award or settlement,eog. hy strike action, whilst this is forbidden are liable to a similarpenalty.   (Since however trade unions are not bodies corporate the effective maximum penalty is a fino of  500 on indictment.)4.
11.   There are similar sanctions under Part IV of the Act against&apos;employers who make a price or charge, or pay remuneration, higher than is permitted under a Part IV order (unless they have received the consentof the appropriate Minister), and against trade unions or employees whoseek to &quot;compel, induce or influence&quot; an employer to breach a Part IVorder.12.   Thus there is no provision for imprisonment for offences underPart II or Part IV of the Act.   An offender could he committed to prisonunder the existing law if he failed to pay a fine imposed under thePrices and Incomes Act, hut the risk of fine defaulters being committed to prison will be very substantially reduced, under the Criminal justice bill now before Parliament.   No prosecution under either Part II or part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act can ho instituted without theconsent of the Attorney-G-oncral.5.
Annex CPay Tncreaaes ,in ,196.7In the course of 1967? and mainly in the months up to july over 6 million workers, including about half a millionnon-manual workers will receive pay increases (or hoursreductions) resulting from commitments prior to July 20th, 1966.Some of these groups, in particular the engineers, builders andthe doctors will get more than one increase in the course ofthe year.    The increases for manual workers under these commit-nients will raise the hourly wage rate index by about 3-zjrfo.2.     Apart from pay increases under existing commitments, pay increases have already been agreed for about 2 million workers(including 1 million covered by Wages Council proposals) tocome into effect either during or after severe restraint, and current claims in the pipe-line cover 2-g- million manual workers and 2 million non-manual workers.    Other groups have reviewsdue or are expected to present claims but have not yet done so.These are expected to cover at least h million workers -possibly many more.3.     Taking into account the pay increases resulting from thedelayed implementation of existing agreements,  the settlementsalready reached and the new agreements in prospect, the index of hourly wage rates is expected to rise by at least 6% over thewhole of 1967.Ii.     The workers due or likely to receive pay increases during1967 fall into four main categories,  of Which the main groupsare:a)
(i) Groups, receiving pay increases (or hoursreductions) under commitments entered into on or before 20th July, 1966 (over 6 million,, including4- mill i on non-manual workers).Engineering,construction, railways, local authoritiesnon-manual, electrical contracting, heating and ventilation,doctors and dentists.(ii) Groups which jjayje,jilre^ady^ agr^d^ increasesi forimplementationduring or after the period of severe restraint (2 millions).Agriculture, food, company busmen, dock labour,retail distribution, cinema theatres, laundries, coal and coke distribution.(iii) Groups which are^pjonsidering claims (2-^ million manual,,2 ...milli,0Ig. non-mj^ual^.Coalmining, brewing,  iron and steel, wool textiles,hosiery (Scotland), paper and paper -box making, printing,electricity sujjply, road haulage, N.H.S. manual employees,government industrial workers, motor vehicle retail and repair trade, Ford and Vauxhall Motor Co., Engineering&quot;white collar&quot;, Civil Service non-industrial, banking,N.H.S. admin, and clerical, Merchant Navy Officers,police, fire service.(iv) Groups where claims are expected or reviews due-Cat least k.. millions)Civil Service non-industrials (central pay claim),teachers, baking (Wages Council), Biscuit manufacture,chemicals, cotton spinning and weaving, catering,hosiery (Midlands and Hawick), wholesale clothing,footwear, furniture and woodworking-, pottery, Londonbusmen, Post Office manual workers, rubber, miscellaneousindustries.
