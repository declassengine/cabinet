DOCUMENT 15 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food at the meeting on 14th February (CC(67) 8th Conclusions, Minute3) the Cabinet approved the proposals put forward by the Minister without portfolio in C(67) 18 on the limits to which the Agriculture ministers should go in negotiations on the current year&apos;s Farm Price Review,The Minister without Portfolio proposed a total award of  25^ million.2.      I am glad to report that I have been able to get an agreed settlement with the Farmers1 Unions at the figure authorised (worked out in detail the figure for the settlement is actually  25. 332 million).Y/ithin this total we have made, in consultation with the Minister without portfolio, some minor adjustments in the proposals for the individual commodities.     By making no change on potatoes and slightly shadingdown the increases on milk, cattle and pigs, we have been able to makea very small award on sugar beet (2s, 6d, per ton), a slight reductionin the cut on eggs (now jfd. a dozen), and - in view of the recommenda-tion by the National Board for Prices and Incomes for increases infertiliser prices - we have brought down the size of the cut in the fertiliser subsidy from  4 million to about  2 million.     I have alsoavoided giving a long-term assurance on pigs,3.       I attach a copy of the Annual Review White Paper which has beenagreed with the Departments primarily concerned.    It will be published on Wednesday, 15th March and I shall, as usual, be making a statement about the Review alter Questions the same day.    Both the White paper and my statement (a copy of which will be circulated later today) willemphasise that, over and above the changes which might other/isebe necessary, we have decided this year to give a special increasein the guarantees for the beef and dairy herds, and for pigs in orderto provide the capital resources needed to finance the selective expansion programme and so save imports.C(67) 26COPY NO.13th March, 1967CABINETFARM PRICE REVIEWT.F.P.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.

ANNUAL BSVIE.W AMD DETEMTJFATION CP (GRANTEES 1[9.6?I.    IKTHODUCTION1,    This is the second Annual Revievj to he held during the period of the selective expansion programme for agriculture.   When the programme was published, in September 1965, as part of the National Plan, the G-overnmentannounced that it would have to be kept under constant review to assess theresources required and to  measure the progress being achieved, and thatthey had agreed with the Farmers1 Unions that the machinery of the annual review should be used for this purpose.   In making their determinations onguaranteed prices and production grants this year   the G-overnment,though they have also taken into account all other relevant factors, have paidparticular attention to the review of the selective expansion programme.2.    Under the selective expansion programme agriculture is expected tocontribute to import saving by increasing its production sufficiently tomeet a major part of the additional demand expected by 1970 for food for human consumption, and also to supply much of the cereals required for theincrease in livestock production.   At the same time, by improving its labour productivity more rapidly than the increase in production, agriculture isexpected to continue to release manpower to other sectors of the economy.While the programme does not lay down precise targets, it envisages anannual rate of expansion in net output broadly comparable to the 3^ per centachieved in the five years preceding the programme.     It also assumes themaintenance of the rate of increase in the industry&apos;s productivity which,&quot;before the programme, had been running at the high rate of about 6 per cent a year.3.    While the economic difficulties of 1966 and the corrective measureswhich the Government were obliged to introduce have invalidated many of thefigures and assumptions in the National ^lan, these difficulties have under-lined how important is the contribution which agriculture can make to thenational economy through import saving, provided that the expansion otproduction is based on increasing productivity.4*    Accordingly, the G-overnrnent have considered what progress has been made towards the objectives of the programme since the base j^ear, I96A.   There arenarked differences between the various sectors of the industry.*  On the arable* Horticulture is not covered by the Annual Review;    but developments i?ithinthe industry are being studied in the cm-rent yoar in consultation with thefarmers1 Unions in the second of the Biennial Examinations, which theGovernment have undei
side progress has been acreage hasexpanded in line with the programme, . although some alteration in the balance between wheat and barley is desirable.    On the livestock side the position is less satisfactory.   Under the programme meat is one of the most importantsectors.   There is particular emphasis on beef which, it is envisaged, shouldbe expanded to the full extent of the technical possibilities.    So far, whilethe beef herd ho.s been expanding, the dairy herd, from which the greater partof our home-produced beef comes, has shown no increase at all.   The sheepbreeding fiock; after a gradual long-term increase, has recently fallen.The pig breeding herd has fallen during the last two years;    in 1966/67 pig production will ho well below the level needed, with departicularly^Mrked &apos;effect on bacon, production. . c&quot; -.5.     Overall, net output is tending to decline.    In 1965/66 the index of net output fell slightly;    the forecast for 1966/67 shows a further slight fall.The industry is releasing labour at a rate higher than is envisaged in the selective expansion programme;   but the effect of the decline in net output in the last two years has been to reduce the average rate of increase in productivity from 6 per cent a year to 4 per cent.   This is disappointing.The Government made clear, in announcing the selective expansion programme in September   ^965, the importance of maintaining a rising level of prcduc-tivity.   They therefore wish to consider whether, within the ambit of presentsupport for agriculture, there are means of further encouraging productivity.It, is proposed that exploratory discussions on this question should take place,,without commitment; between the Agricultural Departments and the Farmers1Unions during the remainder of this year.6.    The Government have considered with the Farmers&apos; Unions the economic condition of the industry;    and it has been particularly useful to have available the additional economic and financial data prepared in agreementwith the Farmers&apos;Unions since the 1966 Annual Review.   For the agricultural industry as a whole, net income has remained static during the last threeyears.   For 1966/67 aggregate net income is forecast to be virtually thesame as in 1965/66, and slightly lower than in 1964/65.   The government recognise that farm income must cover not only the reward to the farmer forhis managerial and manual effort but the return on his capital investment;and that it is the main source of finance for any further investment that be -lecessary.   The Government have therefore had to consider at this Review
whether the industry has the resources required for the further&quot; investmentneeded to ensure sufficiently rapid progress towards the objectives of the selective expansion programme.7,     In doing so the Government have kept fully in mind the requirements of their prices and incomes policy.   The White Paper &quot;Prices and Incomes Standstill:Period of Severe Restraint&quot; (Cmnd. 3^50) sets out the criteria which applyun to 1st July   19^7-   These cover all forms of prices and of incomes,including the incomes of self-employed persons.   The particular criteria toapply from 1st July are still under consideration;   but the Government havemade it clear that the situation thereafter will call for continued restraint on prices and incomes.8.    The Government have also had regard to the assurances they have given tothe industry concerning determinations at Annual Reviews..   When the selective expansion programme was announced the Government stated that they recognisedthat the industry would need to have the physical and financial resourcesrequired to carry out the programme and that this would be taken into account at future Reviews.   At the 1 966 Annual Review the Government gave an assurance about the use to be made of the industry&apos;s annual gaia. fron increasing productivity.Reaffirming this assurance in September 1966, the Minister- of Agriculture,Fisheries and Pood   pointed out that the Government intended, in interpretingthe assurance, to create the conditions in which full-time commercial farmerscan use a reasonable part of their rising productivitj&apos;- to finance any furthernecessary investment and to increase their net incomes and so.their standardof living, although this would naturally need to be carried out within theprinciples of the Governments prices and incomes policy.9.    Against this background, the Government have decided that this year it would be right to give a larger Review award than they v/ould otherwise have considered necessary so as to provide the industry with the capital resources which are clearly needed to finance the selective expansion pro-gramme, particularly on the livestock side.   Had it not been for the exceptional circumstances this year the Government would have considered thattheir right course was to be guided by the assurance on productivity whichthey gave to the industry at the 1966 Annual Review (para. 8 above).   If thisguide line had been followed this year the industry would only have been
permitted, after taking account of costs of  15^Trillion, to have retained apart &amp;f its productivity gain.10.   But because of the ab*ve considerations the Government have decided togi further than this.   The changes in the guaranteed prices and production grants which are being made to give effect to the Government&apos;s decision are discussed below.   Their effect is to add  25 million to the total value ofthe guarantees.   This will not only recoup the industry fully for the assessedcost increases ef  15ijr million, &quot;but will also leave it the benefit of thewhole of its increasing productivity   estimated taking one year with another^ at about  30 million a year   and a further  10 million, which togetherwill provide a substantial further sum for the additional capital investmentrequired for expansion.   The Government believe that this award should givethe industry the confidence and the means needed to make possible a furthersignificant advance towards the achievement of the selective expansion programme.   They are confident that, if farmers respond to this incentive, net output and net income will again resume their upward trend, although both farmincome and production in the coming year can of course also be affected bythe weather and other outside influences.    The Government are satisfied thatthe award is consistent with prices and incomes policy and is essential toenable the industry to continue to make its vital contribution - to the national economy through import saving.4.
II.    ECONOMIC CONDITION OF THE AGRICULTURAL industry the Course of Production11,   The gross output of agriculture in 1966/67 is expected to be virtuallythe same as in 1965/66 while there has been a small increase in the volumeof goods and services purchased by the industry from other sectors.Consequently, the index of agricultural net output is expected to be slightly lovers and is forecast at 135 for 1966/67 compared with 136 for1965/66 and 137 for 1964/65 (average of 1954-/55 to 1956/57 = 100.Appendix I, Table K, page      ) .12.   The barley acreage has again risen considerably, but this was partly offset by a fall in the acreages under wheat and oats.   Yields were below normal for both wheat and barley, and total cereals production was inconsequence only the same as in 1965/66.   The potato acreage fell somewhat,but the yield has continued at only a little below the high level of 1965and, as a result, production at present seems likely to be enough to meetdemand.   Home sugar production is about the same as a year ago.   home production of beef is likely to be higher than in 1965/66.   The beef herdhas continued to increase.   The dairy herd has shown a slight decline, butthe output of milk is about the same.   Home production of mutton and lambis likely to be slightly up but the census returns for December 1966 showed a fall in the number   of breeding ewes. The number of pigs marketed in1966/67 fell substantially and the decline in-the pig breeding herdcontinued throughout the year, but has now been checked.   Home supplies ofeggs over the year are expected to be somewhat higher than in 1965/66.Ino,qriie13.    Actual farming net income in 1966/67 is forecast to be  472 million,about the same a? in 1965/66 for which net income is now estimated at 4-68-g- million.     Adjusted to normal weather conditions, the forecast
becomes  479    million, about 1 per cent more than income on a normal weatherbasis in 1965/06.   Taking the last three years together, there has been little change in the level of aggregate net income.   Since the number of full-time farms is declining, there will have been some improvement in average net income per full-time farm.14.   It was agreed with the Farmers&apos; Unions at the 1966 Review that more comprehensive and up-to-date information should be provided on the valueof occupiers&apos; capital and on the trends of net income and profitability of full-time farm businesses. in total and for the different categoriesand sizes of business.   A comprehensive report on &quot;The Structure ofAgriculture&quot;, published by the Government in September   1966, showed therelative contributions to agricultural output of holdings of different types and sizes and gave some indication of their levels of net income.The classification used in the report has been adopted at this review for summarising the information on farm incomes, output and costscollected for the years 1964/65 and 1965/66 from some 3?500 farms ofdifferent types and sizes throughout the United Kingdom.   A detailed analysis of the information for England and Wales is presented inthis year&apos;s annual report on the Farm Management Survey^ which isbeing published simultaneously with this White Paper.    Similarinformation for Scotland and Northern Ireland vd.ll be publishedlater in the spring,15.   The information shows that following the substantial improvementin net income on all types of farms in 1964/65? there were varyingmovements in 1965/66 according to farm type.   In England and wales the upward trend of net income on dairy farms continued, but on otherlivestock farms net income in general declined appreciably.* &quot;Farm Incomes in England and Wales,&quot; H.M.S.O., 14s. Od.
Smaller reductions took place on cropping and mixed farms.    In Scotlandnet income declined on farms of all types.   While the reduction on dairyfarms was slight, net incomes on other types of farm, particularlycropping and mixed farms, were substantially lower than in 1964/65.In Northern Ireland, dairy farms showed a small further improvement innet income, but there was a. slight decline on mixed farms.   Net incomeon cattle and sheep farms however suffered an appreciable reduction.Examination of the farm accounts throughout the United Kingdom revealsa wide range of net income;   it is apparent that on farms of the same general type and size above-average levels of net income depend on the efficient use of resources as much as, or more than, on the attainment of a high level of output.    (Specimen figures illustrating the changes innet income between 1964/65 and 1965/66 are given in Appendix IV, page       .)Costs and Efficiency16.   The prices of goods and services used in agricultural productionhave continued to rise, but at a slower rate than in recent years.   Theusual calculation made in February showed that, at current levels of use,price changes would add in a full year a net total of  1 rj&apos;  million tothe cost of producing Review commodities.   The main increases are for labour, rent and machinery (Appendix III, page        ).    (The increase inrent reflects higher rents paid in the year up to October 1966, butnegotiated earlier in 1966 or in 1965.)    These increases in costs havebeen taken into account along with the annual gain in efficiency, whichis assessed, taking one year with another, at  30 million for Reviewcommodities.   The figure of  1,5-g- million for the net increase in costs was arrived at before the recent increases in feedingstuffs prices and it doesnot take account of the recommendations made by the National Board for prices and Incomes on the applications by the fertiliser manufacturers for price increases.    The Government have, however, borne in mind the position on feedingstuffs and fertilisers when considering the Review determinations.(Changes in feedingstuffs costs for pigs and eggs are dealt with byautomatic adjustments in the guarantees in accordance with the feed formulae)
17,   The net outflow of workers is expected to be about 30,000 a year in1965/66 and 1966/67 taken together, compared with 23,000 a year between1960/61 and 1964/65.   Because of the slight fall in net output labour productivity over the last two years is expected to rise by about 4 per cent a year on average, as compared with about 6 per cent between 1960 and 1965.nosj^j^lJ^ricifltural Support18.   Exchequer cost in 1966/67 is expected to be  234 million, about thesame as expenditure in 1965/66.   The corresponding estimate figure for1967/68 is  261 million.   In addition, agriculture will benefit from the new investment incentives, which replace the previous investment allowances, andwhich are included in the estimate because they take the form of direct Exchequerpayments instead of&quot; tax concessions.    The estimated figure for investment incentives to agriculture in 1967/68 is  9.6 million, making a total of 271 million for the estimated Exchequer cost in the coming year (seeAppendix V, Table A, page       .)8.
III.      COMMODITIES AND ZIGDUCTICJx GRANTSBeef and jlilk29.   The selective expansion programme stated that beef production would need to be increased to the full extent of the technical possibilitesand recognised that this would require an increase both in the beef herdand in the dairy herd,which is the source of some two-thirds of home-produced beef.   The expansion of the dairy herd would, in turn, entail an expansion in milk production which would meet the growing consumption ofliquid milk and cream and a substantial part of our additional requirementsof milk products.   The Government gave an assurance at the 1966 annual review that, provided there was no significant change in circumstances theywould not reduce   during the period of the selective expansion programmeeither the guaranteed price for fat cattle or the rate of the beef cowsubsidy as determined at that Review.   They also gave an assurance on the pool price of milk which is referred to in paragraph 21;..20.   The beef herd has responded to the incentives that have been given at previous Reviews.    During the period June 1965 to June 1966 itincreased by about 8 per cent., from 1,018,000 to 1,106,000, but therecent decline in the number of beef heifers in calf suggests that therate of expansion may be slowing down.   The dairy herd has been slow to respond to increases in the guarantees.    It was slightly lower in June1966 than in June 1965, and the continued increase in the average size ofherd has not so far been sufficient to do more than roughly offset thereduction in the number of herds.   However, the number of dairy heifers incalf in December 1966 was higher than a year before and some increase inthe total dairy herd is now expected.   Total sales of milk off farms inI966/67 are expected to be about the same as in the previous year.9.

They also gave an assurance on the pool price of milk which is referred to in paragraph 24-.20.   The beef herd has responded to the incentives that have been given at previous Reviews.    During the period June 1965 to June I966 itincreased by about 8 per cent., from 1,018,000 to 1,106,000, but therecent decline in the number of beef heifers in calf suggests that therate of expansion may be slowing down.   The dairy herd has been slow to respond to increases in the guarantees.    It was slightly lower in June1966 than in June 1965, and the continued increase in the average size ofherd has not so far been sufficient to do more than roughly offset thereduction in the number of herds.   However, the number of dairy heifers incalf in December 1966 was higher than a year before and some increase inthe total dairy herd is now expected.   Total sales of milk off farms in1966/67 are expected to be about the same as in the previous year.9.
21.   Home-fed supplies of beef and veal in 1966/67 are estimated to beabout 10 per cent higher than in 1965/66.    Imports are forecast to be at about last year&apos;s level (Appendix I^Table D and Figure   II, page        ).The seasonal fall in market prices for beef last autumn was much more severe than usual, largely because of the closure of the E.E.C. market toexporters and increased imports of fat cattle from the Irish Republic.This fall was reflected In lower returns from store cattle and calves,including calves retained for beef from the dairy herdj and resulted in some loss of confidence throughout the beef producing sector of the industry.22.   The Government consider that, if the objectives of the selective expansion programme are to be achieved, the expansion of the beef herdneeds to be maintained and there must he more dairy cows in orderto ensure an adequate supply of calves for beef rearing.23.   As regards the beef herd, confidence needs to be restored and some further incentive is required if the rate of expansion is to be maintained.This incentive needs to be given at all stages of production.   TheGovernment have therefore decided to increase the hill cow subsidy by 1 5s. and the beef cow subsidy by  1   a   head so as to give more help to rearers, to increase the calf subsidy by  1 a head which will encouragefurther retentions of calves, and to increase the guaranteed price by5s. Od.   a   cwt. to help farmers who take animals both from thebeef and dairy herds for fattening.   The scale of abatements andsupplements under the graduated deficiency payments scheme for beef vd.llbe adjusted in the light of expected market conditions.10.
2J+.   As regards the dairy herd, the expansion in the average size of herdneeds to go ahead faster so that it will more than offset the reductionin the number of herds.   This will require further investment both inanimals and buildings, and the Government have decided that an injectionof capital should be given for this purpose.   The guaranteed price for milkwill therefore be increased by     1.31d.     per gallon which, together withan increase in the standard quantity on account of the rise in liquidconsumption, gives a total increase equivalent to 1-gd. on the guaranteed price.   Dairy farmers will also benefit from the increase in the calfsubsidy.   The arrangements for assisting the Milk Boards&apos; schemes for improving compositional quality will continue in 1967/68.   Since the dairy herd has not yet expanded, no action is called for-under the assurance (given inparagraph 9 of the Annual Review White Paper for 1966) that the Governmentwill take account of any effect on the pool price of extra milk resultingfrom an expansion in the dairy herd to meet the need for increased beef production.25.   Details of the changes in the guarantee arrangements are given inAppendix VI Part II, pageSheep and JJool26.   The aim under the selective expansion programme is that sheep production should increase to meet part of the expected gradual rise in demand formutton and lamb.27.   After a gradual long-term increase, the breeding flock at December1966 was 3 per cent smaller than a year before.   In general, this declinehas been in the lowlands and it is expected that in future an increasing proportion of the breeding flock will need to be found in the hills anduplands.   This will require a more intensive use of grassland in those areas,mere more fattening of lambs should also be possible.    On the other hand,the fattening of sheep In the lowlands will continue to be important as anoutlet for store sheep from the hills.11.
28,   Home-fed supplies of mutton and lamb in 1966/67 are expectedto te a little above the 1965/66 level and total supplies naybe h rjr con&apos;t higher, than in 1965/66     (Appendix I, Table D,rjn,/3      ),   market prices for fat shoop and lambs were generally firmuntil mid-July but there was a temporary sharp drop in the autumn mainlyreflecting the weakness in the beef market.   Prices of store lambs andbreeding ewes, particularly off the hills, also fell, and the Governmenthave recognised the effect which this has had on the incomes of producers.29.   To encourage the development of sheep production in the hills anduplands, the rate of hill sheep subsidy payable on flocks maintained duringthe current year (1966/67) will be increased by 2s. Od. to 21s. Od. for eweseligible in December 1966, and payment of hill sheep subsidy on those ewes atthis higher rate is due to be completed in May.   From now on, the rate of subsidy will be determined for the year ahead.       The new rate of 21s. Od.will apply in 1967/68 to ewes in flocks of the type now qualifying for thestandard rate and which are eligible in December 1967;   payment of subsidy on them at the new rate of 21s*.f d. should be made before the end of March 1968.In addition, to assist the uplands to play their full part in compensating forthe decline in the lowland breeding flocks, the hill sheep subsidy will beextended to include flocks, without restriction on breed, maintained in 1967within the wider area eligible for hill cow subsidy.   This extension to in-clude flocks further dovm the hill   will bring about 2 million more eweswithin the scope of the subsidy;   payment on these flocks will be at a rateof 10s. 6d. per eligible ewe.   There will be a corresponding extension of thewinter keep subsidy arrangements and consequential changes in the arrangements in Scotland.   Finally, the guaranteed price for fat sheep will be increasedby 1d. per lb. to assist fattencrs to maintain an adequate outlet for storesheep.   Details of the changes in the guarantee arrangements are given inAppendix VI Part II, page30.   The criteria for determining the wool guarantee are under discussionwith the Farmers&apos; Unions&quot; and the British &quot;Wool Marketing Board. -Thoguaranteed price fcr wool will remain unchanged.
tion can make a. substantial contribution to our increasing requirements for pigmeat, consistently with our commitments .to our overseas suppliers.It envisages that home production will meet the whole ofthe growth in demand for pork as well as the United Kingdom-&apos;s share ofthe bacon market under the Bacon Market Sharing Understanding.-i      In the fatstock year 1966/67 about 12.4 million pigs will havebeen certified for guarantee, about 1.4 million fewer than in 1965/66,and the current forecast covering the twelve months from December I966is just below .12 million.     Market prices have been much higher than last year, and mainly because of this the Exchequer cost of the pigsguarantee has fallen, from  39lr million to  7 million.     As the forecastlevel of certifications has fallen the effective guaranteed price hasbeen automatically increased under the flexible guarantee arrangements,and is now Is. 6d. abo\re the basic guaranteed price.As announced in September 1966, the middle band in the flexibleguarantee arrangements will be raised by 400,000;    this means that forecastproduction can rise to 13.6 million pigs without any reduction being made,under the flexible guarantee, below the basic guaranteed price.   The Governmenthave also decided that, in order to give a stronger incentive to restoreproduction to the level of the middle band, and to encourage greaterstability of production thereafter, these arrangements should provide for more immediate and effective price correctives when forecasts of productionfall shortsof or exceed ,thc middle band,   Details of the new arrangements are ;*iven in Appendix 71, Part IT, page34,   As was stated in the I966 Annual Review White Paper, the qualitypremium on AA+ bacon pigs will be discontinued, thus completing the pro-cess begun at. the I965 Annual Review of letting the market decide and pay for the quality it requires in the carcase.     The effect of the termina-tipn of the quality premium on the value of the guarantee would be offsetCONF-confidential 
by an increase of 4d. per score in the hasic guaranteed price, hut as afurther measure to bring production up to the desired level, and tomaintain it as close to that level as possible, the G-overnment havedecided to increase the basic guaranteed price by 8d. per score.35.   The effect of these determinations on producers will, apart from theremoval of the quality premium, be as follows. In addition to theincrease in the basic guaranteed price of 8d. per score-, the effectiveguaranteed price to producers will be raised immediately by 9d. per scoreas a result of lifting the middle band.     Furthermore, the other changes in the flexible guarantee arrangements will add immediatelyanother 6d. to the effective guaranteed price.     Hence the effectiveguaranteed price on pigs now coming forward will be raised immediately by Is. lid. per score, and this should enable the industry to invest inthe expansion that is required.     As this expansion takes place, and the forecast levels of production approach the middle band, the additions to the basic guaranteed price for which the flexible guarantee arrange-ments provide will by stages be removed;   but even when the middleband is entered, tho basic guaranteed price then applying to a greatervolume of production will be 8d. higher than before.36.   The fall in production and consequent rise in prices of pigs in1966/67 led to serious difficulties for the bacon curing industry, whichvrere alleviated by a temporary scheme of assistance introduced inDecember I966.     It remains the G-overnment&apos; s wish to see a strong and efficient bacon curing industry, which will continue to offer producersan adequate outlet for bacon pigs of the quality required.     discussions are being held with the industry on what action to that end may benecessary in the longer term.14,
Eggs^y.   The United Kingdom is virtually self-sufficient in eggs and the objectiveunder the selective expansion programme is to meet any increase in demand.This is well within the technical capacity of the industry,jg.   Production in 1966/67 is expected to show some increase over 1965/66;while the trend in egg yields and the size of the laying flockindicate that there will he a further rise in production in 1967/68.     while there is a seasonal decline in the autumn, production remains more thanadequate to meet demand over the year and it is likely that the British EggMarketing Board&apos;s average selling price will be lower than last year and belowthe indicator price of 3s. 1d. - the price which it is expected the board should be able to achieve if supply and demand are in balance.39.   The underlying trend for some years past has been for production to risefaster than demand.     This continues to be the danger and the guaranteed price is therefore being reduced by ^d. a dozen.     The guaranteed price for duckeggs is being reduced by 1.2d. a dozen.     Very few duck eggs are sold underthe guarantee arrangements, and in view of the high cost of administration inrelation to the payments made, the Government believe that the guaranteed price should now be brought towards a level at which guarantee payments arenot normally necessary.h-0.   The Government have agreed with the Farmers&apos; Unions that there should bediscussions with them and the British Egg Marketing Board on marketing arrangements for eggs.Eggs and Pigs - Feed Formulae41,   As foreshadowed in paragraph 45 of the 1966 Annual Review White Paper,consideration has been given to the feed formula arrangements in order toensure that the automatic price adjustments correspond more closely to the changes in feed costs borne by producers.     It has now been agreed with theFarmers1 Unions that an index of compound feed prices, for pigs and forpoultry   respectively^ &quot;will be substituted for the present standard feedprices for an experimental period of three years (Appendix yi, Part II, page     ).15.CONFIDENTIAL
Cereals. g    The selective-expansion programme recognises-that the-expansion of livestock production will increase considerably the demand for cereal feedand that, consistently with our international obligations, a substantial part of this additional requirement should be produced in this country.43.   In 1966 the acreage sown to cereals rose by some 300,000 acres, to- over--9,35 million.   The acreage under barley showed a further substantial increasebut the acreages sown to wheat and to oats and mixed corn fell.   The declinein the wheat acreage ?/as due partly to unfavourable weather.The 1964 Annual Review White Paper (Cmnd. 2315) indicated that there wouldbe some adjustment of the standard quantities as between wheat and barleyin any year when the wheat acreage was abnormally low.   Accordingly for the1966/67 cereal year the standard quantity for wheat as announced after the1966 Review will be reduced and that for barley increased     (see Appendix VI,Part II, page       ) .44.   Yields of wheat and barley from the 1966 crop were below normal   and,despite the overall increase in acreage,total production from the 1966harvest, estimated at about 13.5 million tons, was   only the sane as in1965.   -Yields have been affected by the weather, b\it areexpected to resume their normal upward trend.    Cereals production overall is broadly in line with the requirements of the selective expansion programme.1)5.  The Government have taken account of their obligations under the Agreementsmade with our principal overseas suppliers of cereals.    Imports in 1966/67are expected to fall below the three year average to June 1964 referred toin the Agreements, but the financial incentives to cereal growing,particularly barley, have been reduced by the operation of the standard quantity arrangements.   Moreover, the incentive to plough up grassland for cereals, already reduced by the Government&apos;s decision to lower the rate ofPart I of the ploughing grant at the 1966 Annual Review, will now be further reduced  by the decision to discontinue the grant     (eee para. 55 ).46.   The   Government   undertook when the selective expansion programme was announced that the standard quantities for cereals would not be reduced belowexisting levels over the following three years, but would be related to the expected growth in the market.   Having regard to the overall growth of demand16.
BENTIAL   2 6for cereals the Government have decided to increase the standard quantitiesfor the 19d7 harvest by 600,000 tons in all.     The standard quantity for wheatvail be increased by 100,000 tens and the standard quantity for barley will beincreased by 500,000 tons.     The production of barley, however, has beenexpanding more rapidly than the growth of demand and it is therefore necessaryto change the balance of profitability as between wheat and barley in favour ofwheat.    The guaranteed price of wheat will be increased by 6d. per cwt. andthere vail be a reduction of 7d. per cwt. in the guaranteed price of barley.The effect, after allowing for the increases in the standard quantities on bothcereals, is to leave the cereals guarantee unchanged.Potatoes47.  The objective for main crop potatoes endorsed under the selective expansion programme continues to be that, except in years of unusually low yields, home production should be able fully to meet home demand.kB.  The total United Kingdom acreage planted to potatoes (main crop and earlies)declined by 72,000 in i960 to 669,000 acres.     However, the average yield ofthe crop at 9.7 tons per acre was at a high level, (as in 1965, when the yieldexceeded 10 tons per acre) and the home crop this year at present seems likelyto be sufficient to meet demand.h%  The prices so far realized for the 1966 crop have shown a substantial improvement on 1965 and this could well result in a somewhat higher potatoacreage in 1967.     The Government are leaving the guaranteed price unchanged.They propose, however, to study further with the Unions developments in potatoproduction, including the technical and other factors that have led to therecent increases in average yields, and to consider with them in the autumn, whenthe likely outcome of the 1967 crop is known, the acreage which, in the light,of the trend in yields, will be needed to fulfil the objective in the selective expansion programme, and any implications arising from this.17.
Su arjs.e.e.t50,   The objective under the selective expansion programme is that home production of sugar should supply part of any Increasing demand within theexisting contract acreage and factory capacity and without raising inter-national problems.   The total contract acreage is still being fully taken up;   but the acreage contracted for in some areas has been falling, withthe result that some factories have difficulty in obtaining their require-inents  of sugar beet.   Taking account of this and of the increase in costs,the Government have decided to increase the guaranteed price by 2s. 6d. aton.    The contract acreage will remain unchanged.Field Beans51.   Increasing attention has been paid in recent years to the productionof field beans in this country both as a source of protein for animal feed-ing and as a break crop for cereals, particularly wheat.   The use of the crop in a cereals rotation reduces the incidence of disease and improvesthe fertility of the soil, while at the same time the recent introductionof new varieties of winter beans together with new methods of weed controlmake it possible to grow field beans in a fairly wide range of farming areas.Because beans are important as a break crop, and are   a source of proteinwhich saves imported feedingstuffs, the G-overnment have decided that some financial assistance to encourage an expansion of the acreage under fieldbeans would be justified.    They therefore propose, subject to the necessarylegislative authority, to introduce a grant for field beans at the rate of&amp;5 per acre, starting with the 1968 crop.   The grant would be for an initial period of three years and would then be subject to review in the light ofproduction trends and market conditions.   The cost of this new grant wouldbe taken Into account at the 1968 Annual Review,   further discussions willhe held with the Unions on the details of the proposed new grant, and onthe scope for the development of other break crops.18.
CONFIDENTIAL 228Fertiliser and Lime Subsidies52.   The use of fertilisers and lime is of importance for the growth in production required under the selective expansion programme.   In view ofthe considerable reduction in the rate of the lime subsidy at the 1966Review, the Government have decided to make no change in the lime subsidy.On the other hand, fertiliser consumption in general has risen, indicating that farmers appreciate the economic value of applying fertilisers.   Thecost of the fertiliser subsidy is highf   it is estimated at about  30 million in 1966/67.53.   In considering their determinations at this review the Governmenthave had in mind that the National Board for Prices and Incomes mightrecommend increases in the prices of some fertilisers.   The Board&apos;s pricerecommendations have now been published and the Government.have accepted, them.The fertiliser manufacturers have yet to announce in the light of theBoard&apos;s report what revisions they will be making to their priceschedules.      No increase has been recommended by the Board in the price  ofnitrogenous fertilisers.   Most of the fertilisers required for the cropsto be harvested this year have already been bought by farmers.   Thebulk of purchases still to be made this season will be nitrogenousfertilisers for grassland and for top-dressing cereals.   The mainimpact of any rise in prices will therefore relate to the crops to beharvested in 1968, the guaranteed prices for which will be determined in the light of next year&apos;s Review.   Price increases for fertilisersannounced between now and the 1968 Review will be included in theestimate of aggregate cost changes taken into account at that Review.54.   The Government have also had regard to the fact that grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost of applying fertilisers and lime will beavailable through   the Hill Land Improvement Scheme which the government intend to make under the Agriculture Bill as soon as it becomes law.In the light of all those circumstances the Government have decided toreduce the fertiliser subsidy by just under  2 million per annum. .19.CONFIDENTIAL
Pj^oughirifi Grants Scheme55.   Last year the Government reduced the rate of grant under Part I of thisScheme from  5 to  2   10s. per acre.     Recent developments in methods ofgrassland management and arable husbandry have removed the case for providingthis special incentive for leys of three years or more, and the Governmenthave decided that the grants under Part I of the Scheme should be discontinued.The proposed Hill Land Improvement Scheme will, however, provide 50 per centgrants for the reseeding and regeneration of permanent pasture in the hillsand uplands, including ploughing wherever this is the best method of improving the grass.     No change is proposed in the  12 per acre rate for the Part IIgrants.20.

The &quot;Departmental&quot; estimate is built up fromthe statistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot;national&quot;, farm,whereas the &quot;raised sample&quot; is based on some 3,500 actual farm accounts, whichare expanded or &quot;raised&quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the UnitedKingdom.   There are a number of reasons why the levels of aggregate net incomeshorn in these two series should vary but it is difficult to make a quantita-tive assessment of the individual causes.   Both series are of value inindicating the general trend in the level of income.   The revised series forthe &quot;raised   sample&quot; calculation is based on a new raising method and isprovisional.Note (v)      The &quot;Departmental&quot; estimates for aggregate net income include asprofit in recent years about  8 million on the production of food for consump-tion in the farm household.    In other industries the corresponding sums are nottreated as profit and are relatively much smaller (innany cases non-existent).Note (vi)     Prom the &quot;Departmental&quot; figures for aggregate net income certainsums should have been appropriated by farmers to cover the excess of replace-ment cost over original cost of certain assets (slaughter stock, cultivations,growing crops, etc.) used up in the course of the year&apos;s production and trade.These sums are:-

lictejx).   On the basis cf the original assumptions as to output and market&amp;s, the estimated effect of the determinations set cut in this White paper(other than those mentioned in note (i)), together with the increase to be madeis the retail price cf milk, is a net increase of  16  ra. in the total estimatedccst ( 271 raj of agricultural support by the Exchequer in 1967/68.     This retgrease is the result broadly cf increases of  1 m. on wheat,  6 m. on cattle,2 0, on sheep,  5 m. on pigs and  6 ra. on production grants including  44 m.for earlier payment of subsidy on hill sheep maintained in 1967 and decreasesCf 1^m. on barley and  2 m. on eggs.     The net effect of the determinations onfee Jistioates differs from the effect en the value of the guarantees for several reasons;    the more important are that the price guarantee arrangements for somecoffioaities do not involve Exchequer payments and that the payment periods forsorae items do net correspond with the financial year.A^PENDIiLIFINAL DRAFT

CONFIDENTIAL pr&amp; o 7ANNUAL REVIEW 1967. PARLIAI.^! TAKY STATEMENT1     With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, ishould like to make a statement about this yoar&apos;s Annual AgriculturalReview, the details of which arc in a White Paper available in the vote Office.This year in the Review the Government have looked to see what progress has been made in the selective expansion plan.     This ismore important than ever.     Last yoar&apos;s difficulties make it evenmore necessary to secure all the import savings we can from ourfarmers.3.    Broadly, the arable side, particularly cereals, is expanding inlino with the programme.     The livestock side, particularly meat, isI making loss satisfactory progress.     Overall, net output is tending to decline.     While the labour force is falling rather faster than inthe programme, the decline in output means that the industry &apos;sI productivity is rising more slowly than we had hoped.4.    The Government have kept fully in mind the rcquircnonts of prices and incomes policy.     While the particular criteria to apply from 1st July are still under consideration , it is clear that there will need to be continuing restraint, on prices and incomes.     On the other hand more needs to be done to help agriculture fulfil the programme.5.    We have always recognised that agriculture must have the physical and financial resources required to increase output and productivity inaccordance with the programme.     We have recognised also that farmincome is a main source of the finance for any further investment theindustry may need to make.6-    For the industry as a whole net income has remained virtuallyJpnchangca during the last three years.     The forecast for 1966/67 is;*472m., almost the same as last year and slightly below 1964/65.JC0Sts have increased by   1.5:4m.     This figure does not allow for any:^crease there may now be in fertiliser prices, but we have allowedI 0r &quot;this in our determinations.     Against these cost increases must be/set
set the industry&apos;s rising productivity, estimated - taking one year with another - at about  30m.7,    Our conclusion, after weighing these factors, is that theindustry needs an increase in income to finance further investment,particularly on the livestock side, and it should got this in thenational interest.     If not, the expansion programme will fail.8,    The programme puts particular emphasis on beef.     The beef herdhas been expanding, hut falling market prices last autumn producedsome- loss of confidence.      The dairy herd, from which two-thirds ofhomo-produced beef comes, is static.     Further incentives are needed.Wo shall increase the guaranteed price for cattle by 5s. a cwt.,the calf and the beef cow subsidies by  1 a head, and the hill cowsubsidy by  1. 5s. a head.     These incentives cover all stages ofproduction from rearing to fattening.     To encourage ox-expansion ofthe dairy herd we are increasing the guaranteed price of milk by1-g-d. a gallon, inclusive of the increase in the standard Quantitieson account of the rise in liquid consumption.     The retail price hasto go up to 10d. a pint on April 2nd to pay for increaseddistributive costs and last year &apos; s Price Review award.      This year&apos;saward will mean that it will stay at 10d. until April 1968.9.     The sheep breeding flock has recently fallen.      Since an   .increasing share of th   owes must come from the hills and uplands weare increasing the rate of hill sheep subsidy by 2s. to 21s.      Thishigher rate will apply not only to flocks maintained during thecurrent year, but also for 1967/68.      In addition, the subsidy willoc extended to bring in about 2 million more ewes in flocks furtherdown the hill.     Subsidy on these ewes will be at 10s. 6d.     Winterkeep subsidy payments will be correspondingly extended.      Finally,v&apos;o shall increase tho guaranteed price for fat sheep by 1d. a lb.10.   The pig brooding herd has fallen during the last two years.Thc decline has now been checked, but pigs are well below the level^oded.     Vig are increasing the middle band - in effect, thestandard quantity - by 400,000, as I announced last September, and/increasing
.S0increasing the guaranteed price by 8d. a score.     Wo are alsadjusting the flexible guarantee arrangements to give a strongerincentive &quot;to get production up to the required level, and encouragegreater stability thereafter.     The result of all this is toincrease immediately the effective guaranteed price to producers byIs. 11cL. a score.     Quality premiums will cease to be paid as announced in last year&apos;s White Paper.11.   Production of eggs has over the year as a whole outrundemand.   The guaranteed price will be reduced by fd. a dozen.12.     Cereal production is expanding satisfactorily.     The growth in consumption, justifies an increase in the standard quantities by100,000 tons for wheat and 500,000 tons for barley.      Since barleyis outrunning wheat, we are increasing the guaranteed price of wheatby 6d. a cwt. and reducing barley by 7d.     The net effect is nochange in the cereals guaranty.     We are increasing sugar beetby 2s. 6d. a ton.     There is no change for potatoes.13.    The grant under Part I of the Ploughing Grant Scheme will be discontinued.     The fertiliser subsidy will be reduced by a littleunder  2m. a year.     We do this after considering all thecircumstances, including the recommendations of the National board for Prices and Incomes;    the high cost of the subsidy;    and the factthat special grants for fertilisers will be available in the hillsand uplands after the Agriculture Bi 11 has become law.H.     The net effect of these changes is to increase the value of the guarantees by just over  25m.     This gives full recoupment for the agreed cost increases, together with a further  10m.,    and leaveswith the industry the whole of the estimated  30m.    gain from   &apos; &apos;increasing productivity.     The Government could, consistently withthe assurance on productivity given at the 1966 Review, havepermitted the industry to retain only a part of its productivity gain.&quot;0 have decided that it is right, in the exceptional circumstancesof this year, to go beyond this tc provide the moans for a further/substantial
investment in agriculture.     I firmly believe that, providedfarmers respond to the capital injection given at this Review,output and-income will resume their upward trend and, mostimportant of all, the industry will bo able to make an even greatercontribution to the nation&apos;s needs.
