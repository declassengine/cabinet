DEFENCE EXPENDITURE STUDIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth AffairsThe Foreign and Defence Secretaries in their memorandum c(67) 40 have proposed major changes in our overseas policies in theFar East, involving a rapid run-down of our forces by 1970-71 and their withdrawal from Malaysia/Singapore by 1975-76.2,       The main impact of these changes will fall on the commonwealth countries in the area - Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.A decision to plan on total withdrawal from Malaysia/Singapore represents a major r ever sad of the policy announced just over a year ago afterconsultations with our Commonwealth allies and often reaffirmed since then;  and the speed of run-down goes far beyond anything contemplatedwhen I visited these Commonwealth countries last month.30       In my view the better course would be to adopt as our objectivea reduction of our forces to about half their present level in the nextfew years, to initiate consultations on this basis, and to leave a decisionon the date of eventual withdrawal from Malaysia/Singapore to be takenin the light of developments in what is bound to be a fluid situation in theFar East.4,       If, however, the decision is in favour of the course recommended in C(67) 40, there are certain important principles I would wish to under line:-(a) It should be our clear aim so to handle matters that we do not create a chaotic situation in the Malaysia/Singapore area.     This willbe essential for the carrying out of our policy without disaster.     but very severe strains will be imposed on Malaysia and Singapore both from the need to readjust their own defence arrangements and fromthe impact on their economies.    Malaysia and Singapore are,particularly by South-East Asia standards, successful and progressivecountries due to British rule and friendship in the past, and, as such,assets in the search for peaceful progress in that part of the world,(b) Our negotiations with Malaysia and Singapore can only be realisticif based on acceptance on our part of the need to mitigate the economic consequences of our run-down by malting available civil,&apos; and probablymilitary, aid on a very considerable scale.     The economic problems arising from a run-down of the scale and speed envisaged have not been assessed in detail;  but it is clear that they will be formidable, particularlyin Singapore where there is a real risk of a Communist take-over if thestrains are too great.     There can be no certainty that in Singapore the damage to the economy could be made good by development aid, howeverlarge, and relatively large sums of budgetary aid may be required..(97294)TOP  SECRETTuts DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.... $?r?rr?. f.1^n\..TOP  secret(67) 41 Copy No.31st March, 1967CABINET
(c)    We must be prepared to take fully into account the views expressed by these four Commonwealth Governments in our consultations with them,,    For Australia and New Zealand major readjustments in the disposition and possibly the shape of their own defence forces will be involved.    Gur consultations with them should be full and frank.    Itwill be essential to carry Malaysia and Singapore with us if our run-downis to be orderly and meet our own practical requirements.     Thisunderlines the need for flexibility (paragraph 11 of C(67) 40)o5.       I ask that, if C(67) 40 is approved, my colleagues shouldendorse the three principles outlined above0H,B.Commonwealth Gffice, S. 1/7*1.31st March, 1967
