DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67)1330th January, 1967COPY NO,69CABINETTHE FUTURE OF PRICES AND INCOMES policy memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic affairs in December, 1964, Government, management and unions agreed in the Statement of Intent to co-operate in keeping under review thegeneral movement of prices and money incomes and to examine particularmovements in the light of the national interest.    This recognition that prices and incomes should be the subject of policy, and not just left towork themselves out, was part of a wider economic policy designed topromote efficiency and growth.2,       In the event, the movement of prices, and still more that of wages,showed that intent was not being translated into reality with sufficient speed.Had the economic climate been more favourable the nation might have had time enough to carry into effect a voluntary link-up of productivity, prices and incomes.     The climate was not favourable;  economic growth was not sufficiently speedy;  and in July, 1966, the nation was obliged to embark ona new chapter of prices and incomes policy, involving harsh restraint andbacked by statutory powers,3,       The powers under Part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act, 1966,(which enable the Government to give temporary directives on pay and prices) lapse in August, 1967;  those under Part II (which give statutorybacking to the early warning system and enable the Government to holdup pay and price increases pending investigation by the National board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI)), have not yet been brought into force.When we take into account wage increases caused by the delayedimplementation of existing agreements, those-permissible under the&quot;severe restraint&quot; criteria and new agreements likely to be reachedfor the second half of 1967, we must expect a rise in the index of hourlywage rates of at least 6 per cent over the whole of 1967.    This will affectprices;  and the rigorous holding back of price increases since - and even before - July, 1966, will add to the pressure on prices after mid-1967.Nor can we expect that economic growth will jaroceed at the rate whichwas hoped for when the Statement of Intent v/as drafted;  further,reflationary measures designed to promote growth are likely to increasethe pressure for rises in money incomes and prices.    It is therefore necessary that, after mid-1967, policy on prices and incomes shall bemore speedily successful than in the past in relating both to productivity.We shall, at that time, be out of the emergency - indeed makeshift -chapter of prices and incomes policy in which we have lived since July,1966;  we shall be able, and ought, to present that policy in a more hopeful light and as. part of a policy of growth;  but it must be a hope-fulness which does not outrun reality.    We have had considerable successSECRET
so far with the standstill.    But there may be dangers ahead as thetensions of the severe restraint period develop.     We should not deludeourselves that during 1967-68 we will be successful in reaching all our objectives.     The prices and incomes policy can still offer us a gooddeal but only if it is buttiessed by our other economic policies.Objectives4. The immediate object of policy is to give the maximum possiblestability to the general level of prices.     This is necessary, in the firstplace, to prevent the threat to the balance of payments which drives usback on to &quot;stop-go&quot; policies.    It is also necessary to prevent the socialevils of inflation.    Rapidly rising prices give a relative advantage tothose who receive profits and those wage and salary earners whosebargaining power is strongest;  those whose bargaining power is weakerfare worse, and pensioners worst of all.    In the end, growth - and, with it, everyone&apos;s absolute position - is threatened.    Relative positions arealtered in a manner that is inconsistent both with justice and with economicneeds;  for, in the short or medium term, the strongest bargainers arenot necessarily those whom it is most desirable to encourage.    Amongthe results of &quot;free-for-all&quot; are the imbalance in the pay of skilled andunskilled workers and the low rewards obtained by some of those doing the most essential work,5.      A further object of policy, therefore, is to see that, as realwealth increases, it is shared in a manner which brings the relativepositions of different groups more in line both with justice and witheconomic need.6.       In the presentation of policy there is much to be said formentioning prices, and the reasons for seeking price stability, first.This gives a social and economic purpose to the policy and makes it appear as more than the series of refusals to wage and salary demands which it has, inevitably, appeared to be since July, 1966.Prices7.       It may be said that complete stability of the price-level isunattainable, that a gradual increase of prices is a concomitant of growth;  and that provided our price-level does not rise more than thatof our competitors, we are all right.    Kahn and Berrill* argue that weshould accept, implicitly when we fix a &quot;norm&quot; for wages, a proba.ble2 per cent annual rise in the cost of living:  this, in my view, would be dangerous.    Su.ch an acceptance, even though implicit, would damageconfidence abroad.    Further, policy will never be 100 per centsuccessful and the event will always be somewhat more inflationary thanthe intent;  we shall always get less stability than we aim at.    Without,therefore, taking up the theoretically untenable position that absolutestability is essential, we should declare the maximum possiblestability as our aim.* PI(67) 9, Section III-2-SECFtET
i18.       The view so far presented to me by the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI) is that this aim can be achieved by a simple return to the voluntary system as it was before July, 1966.    They contend that between December, 1964 and July, 1966 the movement of prices was much less than that of wagesj  and that, in so far as it fell short ofwhat was desirable, this was the fault of the Government, through itstaxation policies and its overheating of the economy.    They claim thatif the Government will avoid these errors, competition and thepersuasive influence of the CBI on its members, will look after prices.iI find this view inadequate for the following reasons s-(i) Competition, even with the gradual breakdown of resale price maintenance, and other measures in the restrictive practicesfield, is far from complete.(ii) Consumers are less well^organised than producers and it isdifficult to prevent price-rises unless they are subjected toorganised examination and challenge.(iii) Stability - or near-stability - of the price level requires thatsome prices should be reduced to reflect falling costs.Competition alone is a slow agent in producing this result.(iv) The argument that the Government must refrain from overheatingthe economy is dangerously near to the argument that the wayto prevent inflation is &quot;stop-go&quot;.    How low a level ofunemployment constitutes &quot;overheating&quot; is a debatablequestion.(v)  The persuasive powers of the CBI are limited.(vi)  It might be argued that these objections can be met if industryfaithfully co-operates with &quot;early warning&quot; and recognises theneed for occasional references to the NBPI - as they did in the1965-66 period.    However, the extended early warningarrangements since July, 1966, and the knowledge thatstatutory powers exist, have been powerful influences in securing stability.(vii) Becasue of the considerations mentioned in paragraph 3, moredetermination will be needed in future than was shown before july, 1966.9.       I believe, therefore, that future policy must includ.e a properdegree of notification of prices, and surveillance of them (includingthe scope for price reductions) by the relevant Departments (Board ofTrade, Ministry of Agriculture, etc.);  and that there must bereadiness to refer appropriate cases to the NBPI.    It must be made clear to the public that this cannot mean a complete control of all prices or such a system as prevailed during the war.    It would be for theGovernment to decide which issues were so important as to justifyrepresentations to the industry, and, if necessary, reference to the nbpi concentrating on those prices which are of economic significanceincluding those manufactures of importance in the cost of living.    If,with the passage of time, the CBI becomes increasingly able and willingto exert its own influence on its members, this will be all to the good;and it would be for the Government to encourage such a development.-3-SECRET
10,       The NBPI, when examining any case referred to it, would ofcourse consider, along with other relevant facts, the level of profits in the firm or industry, and this implies a check on profits.    Apartfrom this, however, I do not believe that one should seek to checkprofits as sucho    Indeed, if some firms are able to earn high profitswhile maintaining a satisfactory record on prices, this is something to be encouraged.    The extent to which profits are distributed individends is, I believe, something best dealt with by taxation policy as explained in paragraphs 16 and 17 of Cmnd. 2639.11.        There remains the question whether statutory powers should forma permanent part of prices policy.    If notification and surveillance are maintained voluntarily there would seem to be no case for bringingPart II of the Prices and Incomes Act into force, though it would be wise to keep it on the Statute Book.    Bringing it into force would be unpopular with the CBI and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) if the powers were applied to pay.12.       Part II, however, contains powers for delay only.    The criticalquestion is whether powers should be taken - however rarely used - to restrain prices and to require reductions.    There are already such powers, as part of monopolies legislation, over firms producing one-thirdor more of the total output of a given product;  but they have not yet been used.    Basically, what is involved here is a judgment on whether a voluntary system, worked with greater zeal than before July, 1966, anddrawing on the experience of notification and surveillance since then, canachieve sufficient stability, and whether the influence of the CBI will growto meet the needs of the situation, when there is not, even in the background, any possibility of the use of statutory powers.    Judgmenthas to be based on limited experience;  my own view is that some kindof last resort powers will be needed.    This question is, however,inevitably linked with that of powers over incomes.    Powers over incomeswithout powers over prices would be unjust and politically impossible;powers over prices without powers over incomes could well have such a depressing effect on legitimate profits - or expectation of profits - as to damage the growth on which, in the endB all policy depends.    I thereforereturn to this question in paragraphs 29-32.13.       So far a.s prices and incomes policy is concerned there wouldseem to be no reason for treating publicly owned indvistry differentlyfrom that which is privately owned.    To subsidise public industries -or cause them to starve their own growth - in order to maintain price stability would promote neither their health nor that of the economy.    the pressure we have had to exert on them in recent months is only evidenceof the emergency character of the present chapter of policy.Rents14.      A similar consideration applies to council rents.    The extentto which they should be subsidised., from rates or taxes, is a matter of social policy;  it would be wrong to get ourselves into a position wherethe subsidy had to be increased in order to remedy other defects in theworking of prices and incomes policy.    More efficient and thereforecheaper building would, of course, help to restrain rents; and there isno reason why the efficiency of public house-building should not be as appropriate a subject for comment and scrutiny as the efficiency of anyother branch of production.-4-
15.       Private rents are already subject to control, and the periodicreview of the working of the Rent Act of 1965 should be part of theoperation of prices and incomes policy.Professional Fees16.       These can usually be dealt with most effectively by regardingthem as a form of price.    For example, we are about to refersolicitors&apos; remuneration to the NBPI.Incomes17.       Policy towards incomes involves two essential ideas which have come to be known by the names &quot;norm&quot; and &quot;criteria&quot; though both thesenames have, in the emergency period, collected unhappy associations.However, even if we avoid the names, we cannot avoid the conceptsthey represent.18.       The first idea is that if we are to form any opinion on anyparticular v/age or salary settlement we must have a view a.s to the extentto which, over a given period, the total incomes bill of the country should increase.    K this increase is stated as a percentage of the presentincomes bill, it is a &quot;norm&quot; of so much per cent.    This is, in fact, anaverage;  and if some people get more than the norm others must get less.The difficulty has been that few negotiators will feel that they have done their duty by those they represent if they secure less than the norm, sothat the whole policy can be wrecked through the treatment of the normas the minimum.The &quot;Norm&quot;19.      An alternative method of presentation would be the statement bythe Government, not of a percentage norm, but of a &quot;national dividend&quot; -i.e. a money estimate of the total growth of wealth, which when that required for investment, and pixblic expenditure, was subtracted, would show how much was available for incomes.    The sub-division of thisdividend, however, into the shares for each industry and professionwould, to my mind, present difficulties at least as great as thoseinvolved in arguments over the norm.20.      A realistic norm must be based on reasonable expectation of thegrowth of real wealth.    These expectations, at present, would not supportan optimistic norm;  but a pessimistic one might cause such dismay asto forfeit all hope of support for the policy.    Indeed, the TUG have announced their intention of making - after consultation with management and Government about the whole economic situation - their own annualpronouncement as to what the norm for wages and salaries should be.They reject the view that the percentage increase in the incomes of their members should be no more than the percentage increase in total realincomes.    They are therefore arguing that the proportion of all incomeswhich goes to wa.ges and salaries should increase at the expense of theproportion that goes to profits or to. unearned incomes.    This is, ineffect, to ask for a progressive change in the structure of society.    Thisis referred to, later, in paragraph 33.
21.       Meanwhile, however, we must notice that the rate and extent ofsuch a change is conditioned by the fact that we live in a mixed economy and that the nation could not commit itself to making such a change byprescribed proportions each year.22,      We must also notice that what can be said about norms in theimmediate future is affected by the considerations mentioned inparagraph 3.23.      In this complex situation I believe our right course is on thefollowing lines:-(i) For the 12 months following 30th June, 1967 we must make itclear that no-one can expect an increase through the merepassage of time - i.e. that increases must be justified by reference not to a norm but to criteria.    The first change from &quot;severe restraint&quot; would be to keep a &quot;nil norm&quot; butreturn to the more generous criteria of before 20th Jtily, 1966.(ii) As permanent policy the Government should hold periodically thekind of consultations about the whole economic situation whichare envisaged in the tuc&apos;s memorandum, though we must bearin mind the need to bring into consultation the main interestsnot directly represented by the TUC and CBI.    Every effort would be made to get an agreed &quot;norm&quot; but, in view of the tuc&apos;s approach to the problem, we must recognise that this may well not be achieved.    The Governments estimate ofthe norm should therefore incline towards prudence;   so thatif in the event what was achieved was a compromise between theGovernment^ norm and that of the TUC, nonetheless the policy would have been sufficiently successful.The &quot;Criteria&quot;24.     The second essential idea is &quot;criteria&quot; - i. e. reasons why somegroups should fare better than others.    After much consideration I do notbelieve we can greatly improve on those which were recognised before july, 1966 (in Cmnd. 2639), but I would make the following comments on them:-(i)  Productivity - i.e. the relation of income increases to increases in productivity directly contributed by employees should be certain, assessable and achieved with little delay.    Theapplication of these principles must be one of the subjects ofthat continuous consultation between Government, CBI, tuc and NBPI which is in any case essential to the working of prices and incomes policy as a whole.(ii)  Comparability.    Despite the word&apos;s dreaded association with inflation I see no other principle than fair comparison -whichcan ensure a reasonable chance for those (particularly public servants) whose &quot;productivity&quot; is not readily measurable.
. fun *sin* a % Km aiii)  The special claim of those whose exceptionally low pay iinjurious both to them and to the community.(iv)  The need, in certain cases, to increase or prevent a declinein manpower.25,     The last two are particularly difficult of application; but the exclusion of them (which has been suggested to me) would, I think,produce an unacceptable policy.    We have, throughout, to perform abalancing act between realism and prudence on the one hand and the need to win some measure of support on the other.    Whatever is said,therefore, about norm or criteria must not be so presented as tosuggest that the Government has produced a rule-book in which the answer to all wage-negotiations can be found.    For the longer term, ithas to be considered whether the norm should be stated annually, or for,say, a two-year period with the prospect of variation, up or down, inthe second year in the light of experience in the first.Application26.      Whatever is decided about norm and criteria - or whatever nameis given to these concepts - particular wage negotiations whether atnational or plant level have got to be examined in the light of them;  so far,the policy has concentrated on national negotiations.    For this purpose,advance notification is needed of claims - as it is of prices, and thesame considerations apply here as were mentioned in paragraphs 9*1-1.27.      It will also be necessary for the Government to keep itselfinformed of the progress of negotiations, and to be recognised as havingthe right to express a view as to the consistency of any proposals withthe general tenor of incomes policy,    I do not believe that we should try to make it a rule that the Government should be formally represented atnegotiations since this would provoke resentment and be self-defeating.In practice, the required result will have to be achieved by various types of consultation, more or less informal, in accordance with the traditions of the industry.    Such consultation is necessary since it wouldbe in the highest degree provocative if the Government waited in silencetill negotiations were concluded and then pronounced the resultunacceptable,28.      The Government must clearly make as much use as possible of the voluntary efforts of TUG and CBI to exercise influence on their ownmembers.    Both these bodies take the view that the whole task of fittingparticular claims to the general tenor of policy can be left to them.    1 it could, it would be best left to them; and the time may come when itcan.    I do not believe that time has arrived;  and the Government must therefore interest itself in wage negotiations with the best mixture offirmness and tact which it can contrive.Powers29.      We are now brought again to the question, for incomes as for prices, of last resort statutory powers.    I have considered whether this could be dealt with by activating Part II and increasing the maximumdelaying power therein from four to six or nine months.    But, if thisis done, should such a measure prohibit the retrospective payment ofwages when permission is finally given for an agreement to be implemented?    K it did not, it would be of little help; if it did, then,although it might be part II in appearance, it would be something very different in substance.    We should run the risk of estranging the TUGwithout getting the backing of public opinion which might be won bygreater frankness.-7-SECRET
30.      The question then remains;  does the Government, before Part IVlapses, equip itself with powers, in the last resort, to make certainorders about prices and wages?    The CBI&apos;s views on prices were stated in paragraph 8.    The TUC is opposed to any such power overwages.    Their view is that if the Government approaches the whole problem in a reasonable and not over-legalistic manner;  that if itinvokes and relies upon the genuine desire of the TUC to make a voluntary policy v/ork, then there is a good chance of success;  that ifsuccess is not achieved at first the Government can deal with thesituation by damping down the economy;   and that given time, the nationwould learn the wisdom of making a voluntary policy work.    They say,in effect, &quot;Do not assume that voluntary policy will fail; do not make itsfailure more likely by the provocative introduction of statutory powers;at the worst, if it fails at first, stop-go Is not as bad as compulsion,even if there are failures and further experience of stop-go, in timepeople will  learn&quot;.31.       Against this I set the following considerations:-(i)  We have not all that time to play with.    Another stop-go will produce such depression - economic and spiritual - that itwill be impossible to pick up the pieces of policy thereafter.(ii) Although the TUC, officially, is bound to protest againststatutory powers, public opinion is such that they will notprovoke widespread resentment.(iii) A Government which had to resort again to stop-go because itcould not restrain a limited number of un-public-spiritedpeople would in effect be saying to many workers&quot;We are obliged to subject you to unemployment anddepress your bargaining power because other workers -better-off than you - refuse to have regard to thepublic interest and we have to let them get away with it. &quot;32.      On balance, therefore, and despite the risks involved I believe the weight of argument is for last resort powers over prices and wages,including the power to phase the implementation of pay and price increases.    They might need to be safeguarded, for example, as follows:-(i)  The power to use them should be in a Part of the Act subject to annual renewal.(ii)  They should not be used unless an independent body (NBPI?) had stated that this use would be justified.(iii)  Their use should be preceded by consultation and opportunityto make representations.The nature of these powers will require full consideration by ministers which will have to take into account the difficulties of enforcement ofwhich I arn very conscious.-8-
Voider Considerations33.     I mentioned in paragraph 19 the tuc&apos;s view that prices and incomes policy should be an instrument for social change,    I agree withthis to the extent of saying that if it is to be just or acceptable it mustbe accompanied by measures which promote such change,    I have inmind the following :-(i) We should seek to halt the move towards very large incomeswhich has appeared in recent years.(ii) We should - as we are doing through Capital Gains Tax and theLand Commission - seek to prevent the accumulation of wealthby means which do not add to production.    Restraint by thosewho do produce (whether rich or poor, employees ormanagement) is not consistent with gains by those who do not.(iii) We should give particular attention, in the social services, tothe needs of the poorest - it is here, rather than inside incomes policy itself, that we can best help the &quot;lowest-paid&quot;.(iv) We should emphasise the importance of increased educationalopportunity - and increased opportunity to acquire industrialskills - in promoting a distribution of incomes that is both more efficient and more just.    K we have more people with skill and professional knowledge and fewer people who have to be drudgesbecause they have not acquired the skill for anything else, weshall move at the same time towards a healthier economy and amore equal society.(v) We should strive to remove the remaining prejudice against theemployment of women.    In the main, women are among thelow-paid because the supply of their labour is squeezed into toofew occupations.I am aware that this is all long-term.    But I believe that we must make it clear that we are moving in this direction if we are to makeincomes policy acceptable.    At the same time we must emphasise whatis being and will be done to increase production.    Incomes policy whichshares increasing wealth is more acceptable than one which always triesto re-carve the same sized cake.Immediate Steps34.      The Government will need, in the spring to make its intentionsfirm and clear.    I have, before then, to conduct further consultations;but, particularly in view of the tuc&apos;s Conference of Executives on 2nd March, I shall have to give them a clearer indication of theGovernment^ thinking than I have done so far;  and I must do this in thenext week or two,    I suggest that I should speak on these lines%-(i)  Remind those concerned of the Statement of Intent, and say thatthere must be a prices and incomes policy, more firmlypursued than before July, 1966.-9-
(ii)  State the objectives of this policy as stated in paragraphs 4-t6....... ...    ..       ...... i .. . : . . ..... .     .....    . ;.. . . ..... . &apos;... ........(iii) That, while recognising the need for consultation, theGovernment must state its view of what can be afforded -and that this means stating &quot;norm&quot; and &quot;criteria&quot;,.(iv) That for the period immediately after 30th June, 1967, allincreases must be justified and regard must be had to whichworkers have, and which have not, obtained increases in the twelve months ended 30th June, 1967.(v)  That subsequent judgments on the norm must be governed byreasonable expectations of growth.(vi)  Criteria to be stated tentatively as in paragraphs 24 and 25jthey are clearly matters for discussion.(vii)  On powers, to say that Part IV will lapse;  that Part II willremain on the Statute Book, but that I am not at present mindedto bring it into force.    As to the taking of new powers, I would explain that the Government has not yet taken a final decisionbut that the decision will be influenced by the ability of the   TUGand CBI to convince us that by their own efforts they can dealwith the &quot;selfish minority&quot;.    (I do not think they can; but, atthis stage, they must be faced with the task. )(viii)  That the Government sees prices and incomes policy in the widercontext described in paragraph 53.35.      As a precaution, we should now consider the form and terms offurther legislation and its place in the timetable.    It would need to bein force before Part IV lapses on 11th August.M.S.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.1,31st January, 1967-10-SECKET
