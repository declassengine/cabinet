DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT))(67) 18 COPY NO.   U10th February, 1967CABINETFARM PRICE review memorandum by the Minister without PortfolioI ask the Cabinet to resolve a disagreement in the ministerial committee on Agricultural Policy on the limits to which agricultural ministers should go in negotiations on this year&apos;s Farm Price Review.2.       The Committee reached agreement on a large number of the commodities included in the Review and I need not trouble my colleagues with these.    We could not however reach agreement on two matters:beef/milk and pigs.    Appendix A sets out the respective positions onthese two issues.    Appendix B summarises in tabular form from thetotal effect (over all the Review commodities) of the alternative proposals.    It may help my colleagues if I set out my own viewson how the differences might be resolved.General3,       We are committed to the selective expansion programme set outin the National Plan and recently endorsed by the Ministerial steering committee on Economic Policy.    While the programme did not settargets for particular commodities, I am satisfied that we shall notachieve it unless we secure a substantial increase in beef &apos; two-thirds of which comes from the dairy herd) and in pig production.    For this,additional incentives are needed.4.       We must, however, have regard to the total size of the award inrelation to Exchequer costs and the prices and incomes policy.     TheAgricultural Ministers suggest a total award of  35 million, which represents 7 per cent of total farm income.    This would allow farmers to meet all of this year&apos;s cost increases, leave them  20 million toimprove income and invest, and permit them to retain the whole ofthe benefits of increased efficiency (currently assessed at  30 million per annum).    In my view, this would be over-generous.     The Treasury,DEA and Board of Trade, on the other hand, following discussions in theCommittee, would support recommendations implying a total award in the range of  15-18 million.    While this would cover cost increases, leaving the farmer the whole benefit of increased efficiency, I do not feel it wouldbe adequate if we are to achieve our expansion objectives.    In my view,an award in the region of  25 million would be justified.
Beef/ Milk5.       The main issue here is the increase in the guaranteed price for milk.    Any increase falls on the consumer.    The retain price at present is 9jd, a pint.    Under present arrangements, this will rise to lOd. a pinton 1st April, 1967, stay at that level till the end of the year, then fall to^-d. for the remainder of the milk year (i. e. up to 1st April, 1968),    Ifthe price were kept at 10d, till 1st April, 1968, this would permit anincrease in the guaranteed price to the farmer of approximately jjd.per gallon.     The economic Departments feel we should not go beyond this.    The agricultural Departments want an increase to the farmer of2d, a gallon, which would mean increasing the retail price from 10do tolO^d. a pint from December, 1967, to the end of the milk year (1st April,1968).6.       In my view, the smallest increase consistent with attaining our objectives v/ould be 1-^d. a gallon in the guaranteed price to the farmer.This would mean holding the retail price at lOd, a pint until the end ofJanuary, 1968, then increasing it to lO^-d. for the remaining two monthsof the milk year.    I do not think this would be unacceptable from the pointof view of prices and incomes policy.    I also consider that the other proposals put forward by the Agricultural Ministers in this complex -increased calf, beef cow, and hill cow subsidies and a 5s, Od. increasein the guaranteed price for beef - are justified.    This wd uld mean thatthe award on beef/milk would be  24-1 million, compared with  11-13million recommended by the economic Departments and  29j millionrecommended by the agricultural Departments.Pigs7,       The Ministerial Committee agreed that the &quot;middle band&quot; shouldbe increased as already announced (equivalent to an increase of 9d, ascore in the guaranteed price) and that the guaranteed price should beincreased by 4d, a score to offset the former quality premiums.    Thenet effect of these changes would be an increase of  jr. million.    It wasalso agreed as part of the general arrangements for pigs that the guaranteemechanism should be altered so that the progressive fall in the guaranteed price as the number of forecast certifications rises beyond the &quot;middleband&quot; should be made steeper, and conversely the progressive rise inthe guarantee as certifications fall below the &quot;middle band&quot; should alsobe made steeper.     The effect of this will be to increase returns to pigproducers over the present levels so long as certifications remain (asthey are now) below the &quot;middle band&quot;:  the increase would total some 2 million, but this would not technically be included in the total valueof the Review award,8,       In this situation, the Treasury do not feel we should go beyondan increase of 4d, in the guaranteed price.    The agricultural Depart-rnents, supported by the DEA and the Board of Trade, think the priceshould be increased by 9d,9,       An increase of 9d, would allow pig producers to retain the wholevalue of increased efficiency, and from this point of view an increase of6d, would be more justifiable.     But an increase of this amount would bear hardly on Northern Ireland farmers who depend to a great extent-2-
on pig production;  and in these circumstances I think that the full increa(9d, a score) is justified.    I do not, however, consider it necessary (asproposed by the Agricultural Ministers) to give an assurance regardingguaranteed price levels extending over three years in a commodity asliable to fluctuation in supply as pigmeat:  I think an assurance coveringonly the 1968 Review would be adequate.Other Commodities10.       In order to keep the total value of the award within the limit of 25 million which I have suggested, I propose that the guaranteed priceof potatoes should be raised by only 5s. Od, a ton as against the 10s. Od.which Departments have agreed:  this will save just over  1 million.The fertiliser subsidy is currently running at the rate of some  30million per annum:  there is general agreement that some reduction could be made without loss of farming efficiency,    I propose that thisshould be set at  4 million and should stand irrespective of whether theNational Board for Prices and Incomes recommend an increase in theprice of fertilisers following their examination of the case currentlybefore them.Conclusion11,       On the basis of my proposals, the award for the 1967 Review woulamount to  25,25 million.    In addition there would be a  2 millionaddition to the income of farmers as a result of the change in thearrangements for guarantees for pigmeat;  but this cannot be reckoned as part of the award.    Of this total sum of  27. 25 million,   13f- million would fall upon the Exchequer and  13j million v/ould fall upon the consumers of milk,     The figures are summarised in Appendix C,P, G, W.70, Whitehall, S.W.1.10th February, 1967
ISSUES IN DISPUTEBeef/MilkThe Agricultural Departments proposed to further stimulate theproduction of beef, with the aim of achieving the selective expansiontarget of a total saving on imports of beef and milk products of 54 million by 1970, at a cost of some  30 million to the Exchequer andthe consumer of liquid milk combined, through(a) increasing the guaranteed price of milk by 2d a gallon (plus 18.25 million);(b) increasing the calf, beef cow and hill cow subsidies (plus 4. 75 million);(c) raising the guaranteed price for be^f by 5s a cwt (plus  6.25 million).The Treasury considered that the Agricultural Departments hadunderestimated the effects on production of the present economic situationand that if necessary some shortfall in the expansion target must beaccepted owing to the disproportionately high cost of achieving the fullobjective.    They proposed, at a total cost of  9 million(a) increasing the guaranteed price of milk by fd a gallon to offset the rise in costs (plus  4.5 million);(b) increasing the calf and hill cow subsidies (but not the beef cowsubsidy which was introduced only last year) as proposed by theAgricultural Departments (plus  4. 5 million).The Department of Economic Affairs did not accept that further expansion could not be achieved except at the cost proposed by theAgricultural Departments and did not wish to see a further increase inthe retail price of milk in 1967-68.The Board of Trade supported the Treasury proposal on milk,together with an increase in subsidies and the guaranteed price of beefon the lines proposed by the Agricultural Departments.    This v/ould cost 15. 5 million.After discussion in the Committee, the Chief Secretary, Treasury,accepted an increase of fd a gallon in the guaranteed price of milk(plus  6-f million) and the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary,Department of Economic Affairs, indicated that he would be prepared toaccept a total increase of  9 million on the value of the guarantees inrespect of the guaranteed prices of milk and beef and of the hill cow andbeef cow subsidies, the allocation of the sum to be left to the discretion of the Agricultural Ministers, subject to a maximum of -fd a gallon on milk.    The President of the Board of Trade agreed to some advance onan increase of fd a gallon.    He considered that a limit of  111&quot; million should be imposed on the total additional financial incentive in thebeef/milk complex.-4-
4XPigsA rise in the &quot;middle band&quot; for pigs (above which the rate of subsidy begins to fall) was announced last September to take effect inthe current Review; Departments agreed that this must stand.The Agricultural Departments, the Department of economic affairs and the Board of Trade proposed to increase the guaranteed price of pigs by 9d a score to take account of increased production costs (5d) and the abolition of a special premium (4d): the latter was generally accepted.    At the same time they wished to give ah assurance that there would be no reduction in either the guaranteed price of pigmeator the upper limit of the &quot;middle band&quot; at the next two Annual Reviews.As part of these arrangements, the Agricultural Departments would accept the proposed alterations in the guarantee mechanism as a safe guard to the Exchequer if pig numbers should, over the next fewyears, rise unduly.The Treasury view was that any increase in the guaranteed price(apart from the 4d increase to offset abolition of the quality premium)and any long-term assurance would be unacceptable.The Foreign Office were generally opposed to giving any longer term assurances.It was generally agreed, subject to the views of the agricultural departments referred to above, that the guarantee arrangements shouldbe altered so as to increase the incentive to produce up to the level ofthe middle band and to deter subsequent over-production.    This would add to producers1 returns for the time being  2 million, which howeverthey would lose as soon as the middle band was reached.    This would,for technical reasons, not count as part of the formal award.-5
