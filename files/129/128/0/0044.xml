PART IThe Common Agricultural Policy of the EECBasis of Community policy,     The Treaty of Rome-provides that the Common Market shall extend to agriculture and to trade in agricultural products;    and that a common agricultural policy shall be developed and fully implemented by the endof the transitional period, i.e. by end 1969.     The Treaty defines the objectives of the policy as being to increase agricultural productivity,to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, to stabilise markets, to guarantee supplies, and to ensure their delivery to consumers at reasonable prices.     It also provides that in order to achieve these objectives a common organisation for agricultural marketsshould be established, excluding discrimination between producers orconsumers anywhere within the Community, and that one or more agriculturalguidance and guarantee funds may be set up to finance the agriculturalsystem.2.     The Treaty does not prescribe the actual form which the common agricultural policy should take, nor the measures for establishing and operating the common organisation of agricultural markets in the variousproducts.     But, under the Treaty, the Community has since 1962 beenadopting a series of detailed.regulations and decisions to lead to the eventual establishment of a common market for agriculture and to giveeffect to a common agricultural policy.     Some of the regulations have yet to be made, and in no case (except for some horticultural products) hasthe stage of full implementation of the common market organisation beenreached.     It will not be possible to assess the effects of the common agricultural policy by reference to practical experience of its full operation until some time after both commodity regulations and commonprices have been in force.     But sufficient detail has been settled fora meaningful summary to be made of its main elements -(i)   the common organisation of markets for particular commodities;(ii)    common price aims throughout the Community for particular commodities;(iii)   arrangements for financing the policy;(iv)   rules governing State aids to agriculture.-1-m RET

SECRETCommon Organisation of Markets3.     In negotiating and applying the Common Agricultural Policy the&apos; Community has adopted a pragmatic approach.     The condition of agreement among member countries, which on the essential elements of commodity pricesend Community financing has &quot;been reached only with extreme difficulty, hasoften &quot;been provision for exceptions to the general rules.     The presentmembers, however, have been able to press for such exceptions as the priceof their agreement to the arrangements in question.     Our position wouldbe much less favourable in this respect.4,     In detail the separate regulations for the various oomtcditioB differquite widely, but they are all based on the samo- underlying principles.These are that the protection of national markets against supplies fromother Member States should be progressively eliminated and a common market -freely open to all Community producers - established;    that producers areto look to this common market for their returns, and not to price guarantees or subsidies;    and that the common market shall be &quot;managed&quot;with the object of securing that it yields the appropriate level ofreturns to producers and in other respects serves the objectives of thecommon agricultural policy (see paragraph 2 above).5.     The common market is to be managed through various devices designed tosupport prices in the market.     The operation of these devices can best be illustrated by reference to the cereals regulation.     This defines theam of the common organisation for cereals in terms of target prices,that is the prices at which the Community is aiming in operating its support system.     The regulation provides for a target price for each ofthe various grains on the wholesale market at Duisburg (where localsupplies are shortest in the Community).     Erom the Duisberg target price,a deduction is made for cost of transport from Rotterdam (the main entry-point for supplies from outside the Community - i.e. from &quot;third countries&quot; -to the Duisburg market) to arrive at a threshold price i.e. the lowestprice at which imports csxi cross the Community&apos;s threshold (frontier)without undermining the target price.     The Community market is thenprotected against lower-priced imports by the imposition of levies, on allconsignments entering the Community, representing the difference betweenthe threshold price and the lowest price at which imports are being offered(c.i.f. Rotterdam) from any source.     The levies are varied from time totime to reflect changes in the offer prices of cereals in the world market.Thus, once the target price has been determined the Community market isinsulated from the effects of fluctuation in world market prices,6.     As a converse of the levies, export subsidies are payable to enableCommunity exporters to compensate for the higher internal prices and socompete in world markets.     The common market organisation for cereals also includes arrangements for support-buying (e.g. for disposal as stock-feed)by official agencies at prescribed intervention prices set somewhat belowthe target prices. SECRET-2-A
7,    The nain features of the arrangements for other principal commodities are set out in Annex A.     The dommodity regulations themselves do notprescribe the levels of the various forms of common prices (see paragraph 9&quot;below) j nor do they lay down the manner in which finance is to he providedfor ex port subsidies and market intervention (see paragraph 10).Common Prices8.     The Community arrangements envisage the gradual adjustment of price levels for each commodity to a common Community level.     For some commodities this is to he effected through the fixing of a communitytarget (or comparable) price;    for others the common producer price isexpected to result from the establishment of a common market in the commodity in question.     Common prices are being introduced for the majorcommodities in the Community at various dates up to July I968.     As ageneral rule, each commodity regulation provides for the separate fixingeach year of the relevant common prices, though in practice the Six have tended to reach their decisions on prices and related matters in a seriesof &quot;package deals&quot;, and are moving towards a single set of price decisionsannually.Financing the Common Agricultural Policy9.     The Community has, by regulation, created an Agricultural guidance and Guarantee Fund.     The Guidance Section subsidises improvements of astructural kind in agricultural production and marketing;    the GuaranteeSection finances market intervention and export subsidies.     under arrangements agreed by the Six for the period July I967 - December 19^9,Member States are to make Exchequer payments to the Guarantee Sectionequivalent to 90 per cent of the proceeds of levies on imports, and willmeet the rest of the Fund&apos;s needs - that is, any balance required by theGuarantee Section as well as the requirements of the Guidance Section - by national contributions on a scale of fixed percentages.     No decision has yet been taken on financial arrangements from 1970 onwards.     In I962the Council decided that in the common market stage, receipts from the levies should go to the Conmunity and be appropriated to Communityexpenses, but this decision has not been ratified by Member States.10.   Based on predictions of the levels of Community production, consump-tion, imports and exports of the various commodities, and of community and world prices, the Commission have estimated annual expenditure fromthe Guarantee Section in 1970 at over  480 million.     Under the present arrangements, applying up to the end of i969, annual expenditure from the guidance Section is United to  100 million.     Thus the estimate of total annual requirements for the Fund on which the Community is working amountsto some  580 million.-3-secret
State Aids to iW^iguLt^-lg11,  The e.c. s policy on state aids to agriculture - which v/ould governtheir attitude towards our production grants and other forciB of assistance -has not yet been defined in detail.     Article 92, in effect, prohibits stateaids that distort competition between.Member States (but what constitutesdistortion of competition is a matter which the Council can decide underArticle 94);   Article 93 provides for a comprehensive review of aids inMember States and empowers the Commission (subject to any unanimous overridingdecision by the Council) to require the abolition or modification of any thatit deems to be incompatible with the Common Market,     Generally, the marketregulation for each commodity has included a provision applying Articles 92to 94 to that commodity, and the Commission has subsequently examined andpronounced upon aids granted by Member States to the pi*oduction of thecoamodity in question.     So far this has been done on an ad hoc basis, but aCommission proposal for a regulation laying down criteria for judging whetherparticular aids are admissible is now under consideration.     Under thisproposal any aid specifically related to the price of or return for aparticular product would be deemed incompatible with the Common Market.Exceptionally, however, member countries have in practice been allowed tobreach this principle.Comparison of e.c. and United Kingdom Systems12,   The general objectives of the Community*s agricultural policy(paragraph 2 above) are practically identical to those of our own, as setout in the Agriculture Act, 1947;   but their methods for achieving the objectives are fundamentally different,,     The e.c. is largely self-sufficientm temperate foodstuffs, whereas we import about a third of our requirements and have a complex network of international trading relations.     In 19^4about one in seven of their total working population were engaged inagriculture, compared with about one in twenty-five in the United Kingdom,(Before 19^4 both agricultural working populations were declining, theirs byabout 5 per cent per annum0)     And structurally, the Community&apos;s agriculture in general is far behind ours.     These disparities largely account for thefollowing essential defferences between the eec&apos;s regime for agriculture andour own,13.   Under the Community system producers&apos; returns depend largely on howsuccessfully market price levels can be sustained by the levies and tariffs on imports from third countries, by export subsidies and by market interventionfor some commodities.     If the management of the market fails to yieldthe desired result, the effect is felt by the producer.     Under our-4-SECEET
system, producers collectively are assured, in respect of each product, thattheir collective receipts from the market will be supplemented by deficiency round to yield the guaranteed price determined by the G-overnment forthe product.     Moreover, the individual commodity regulations in the Community,in general, separately provide for the fixing of relevant common prices eachyear;   whereas under our system guaranteed prices are determined in thelight of a comprehensive re vie v.&apos; of the industry&apos;s costs and incomes,production and consumption trends and not only commodity by commodity, andthe industry has assurances about the minimum levels of the guarantees fora period of years ahead.14.   The second essential difference lies in the method by which support for agriculture is financed.     Under the e.c. system the main cost of supportis borne directly by the consumer in the market prices paid for agricultural products and direct G-overnment aid is largely channelled to improvements ofa regional or structural kind.     Under the United Kingdom system, broadly speaking, the consumer buys at the world market price, and farmers&apos; returns are brought to the determined level by deficiency payments and direct grantsat Exchequer cost.15.   The third main difference is in the regime applied to imports.     the eec system depends largely on raising the price of imports to a level whichsafeguards the essential interests of Community producers by preventing theirmarket from being undermined.     The United Kingdom system does not seek toraise the price of imports (except in the cs.se of cereals, and then to prices far lower than SEC price levels), but guarantees to home producerson average a minimum return through the deficiency payments system.      (hedo however adopt other methods of regulating imports, primarily in order toensure market stability and so avoid inflating the cost of deficiency payments to the Exchequer, as well as damage to the market of our suppliers, e.g.New Zealand.     Bacon and butter are the best examples).16.   These diff erences find reflection in the generally higher level of market prices which the Community system seeks to maintain.     The Community1scommon price structure also reflects the fact that most of the Six are high cost producers of cereals and that, historically, their cereals prices have been generally far higher in relation to livestock prices than has been thecase in the United Kingdom.     Producer prices for wheat in the Common Marketare expected to be about 1+0 per cent higher than our own and for barleyabout 20 per cent higher.     The common prices envisaged for other products inthe e.c. are in general nearer to the level of our own prices, but on the otherhand higher cereal feed prices would put up costs for our livestock producers.4 table comparing e.c. and United Kingdom producer prices for the maincommodities is appended at Annex B.
Implications of Adoption by; the United Kingdom of theEECs Agricultural Arrangements As They StandBritish Agriculture17,   The differences between the two support systems make direct comparison of producer prices very difficult.   But on the basis of prosent UnitedKingdom prices and those so far fixed for the Community in the Common Marketstage, adoption by the United Kingdom of the Community arrangements as they stand would have these results.   Cereals (which account for 12 per cent oftotal farm sales) would be more profitable than now, and this combined withreduced profitability for some other commodities would lead to a substantialfurther expansion in cereals production from under 18 million tons in 1973under National Plan assumptions to some 20 million tons.   Beyond this,various physical and climatic factors increasingly limit the expansion ofproduction.   The higher beef prices in the e.c. should provide some incentive to expand beef production (now 15 per cent of total sales).   Higher feedcosts would reduce profit margins on pigs, poultry, eggs and milk (which now account for about 50 per cent of total farm sales).   In the absence of intervention arrangements for pigs (proposed by the Commission but not yetadopted), and given the risk of cyclical over-supply in a Community embracingthe bulk of our overseas suppliers, our producers would face greater instability-bility of returns than at present.   Some sections of the horticulturalindustry would be severely affected by removal of their existing protection against favourably-placed competitors in the Community.18,   The changes in profitability for different commodities would lead tothe need for a substantial redeployment of resources, especially capital.Broadly, northern and western parts of the United Kingdom, where farmers are largely dependent on livestock products, would be particularly affected.The degree to which they were affected would depend in part on whether wehad to discontinue some of our direct grants (e.g. hill cow, calf and hillsheep subsidies) which are of special benefit to large numbers of farmers in those areas.   It might be, however, that these could be replaced byregional and other grants approved and perhaps in part financed by theCommunity.19.   Our producers would no longer have the relative security provided bythe price guarantees and long-term assurances, coupled with comprehensiveannual reviews, under the Agriculture Acts.   But because of the boost tocereals in particular, net farm income in total might be at least as goodunder the Community&apos;s arrangements as it is now.   It would, however, bedifferently distributed between commodities, types of farm and regions -except, in the latter case, to the extent that changes in production couldbe brought about by methods approved by the Community.
Agricultural Imports from the Commonwealth20.   If we were to adopt the Community8s agricultural arrangements as they stand our agricultural imports from the Commonwealth would be affected by three main factors - the levy system, which would raise the price of commonwealth supplies sharply and institute a small preference against themin favour of Community supplies;    the reduction in our import needs following the stimulus to increased United Kingdom production (particularly of cereals);and the effect on consumption (e.g. of butter) of higher retail prices.21.   A serious problem would arise over New Zealand, whose agriculturalexports to the United Kingdom ( I76 million in 1 964-65) account for nearly50 per cent of her total exports.   We take 85 per cent of her better exports(170,000 tons in 1964-65, worth  55 million) and 80 per cent of her cheeseexports (80,000 tons, worth  17 million).   There is no prospect of herfinding alternative markets for anything like these quantities.   Her position on butter would be further complicated if Denmark and the Irish Republic,both important producers, also joined the Community.   New Zealand&apos;s exportsof wool to the United Kingdom and the e.c. are worth about  25 million and 45 million respectively, and these exports also would be at risk to theextent that exports of mutton and lamb were adversely affected.   We take80 per cent of her mutton and lamb exports (300,000 tons, worth  60 million).The Community have not yet made a market regulation for mutton and lamb,but New Zealand&apos;s exports to the United Kingdom would face the common external tariff of 20 per cent.22.   The Community8s proposed arrangements for sugar provide for individualnational production quotas until 1975, and for levies on imports.    (TheTFrench Overseas Departments share In France&apos;s national production quotaand imports into the Community from one Associate - Surinam, a smallexporter - enter the Community free of levies.)   About 70 per cent ofUnited Kingdom sugar consumption comes from Commonwealth countries underthe Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, which runs until 1974, at prices much higher than the world price.   A major problem would arise in reconciling the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement with the sugar regime of the e.c..   three off the Commonwealth countries involved (Barbados, St. Kitts and Mauritius)depend on sales of sugar and sugar products for over 85 per cent of theirvisible exports;   Eiji for over 50 per cent;    Guyana, Jamaica, Swazilandand British Honduras for at least a third.   The Community is already a surplus producer of sugar, and e.c. prices would stimulate production in the enlarged Community.    The prospects are uncertain for the early negotiationcf an International Sugar Agreement providing for the control of productionand exports in the interests of more remunerative world market prices.-71SECRET
SECRET;48723,   Among other significant Commonwealth supplies that would he affected arecereals from Australia and Canada and dairy produce from Australia.     Apartfrom their concern over sugar, the Caribbean countries would also faceserious problems if they were to lose their present highly protected marketsin the United Kingdom for citrus, bananas, cigars and rum.Balance of J^ygents24,   Acceptance of the Community1s agricultural arrangements would adversely affect our balance of payments because of (a) the increased volume and highercost of imports from the rest of the Community, and (b) the net cost of theUnited Kingdom^ contribution, including the transfer of levy proceeds on imports from other sources, to the Guidance and Guarantee Fund.25.   Calculations made by officials have been based on a hypotheticalcomparison, at 1964-65 import prices, between what our situation would balfour we were operating fully   the Community&apos;s present arrangements by 1972-73and the projected situation at that time under the conditions of our ownselective expansion programme.     Under the present financial arrangements weshould he required to pay into the Fund 90 per cent of our levy receipts,and a fixed contribucion.     On the other hand we could probably expect to benefit from the Fund for market intervention (e.g. on wheat and barley),export subsidies, and aids for structural Improvements.     To allow for possible underestimate of the Fundls total requirements or our receipts from it, and for the wide margin or error inevitably involved in this highlyspeculative exercise, the net cost to our balance of payments has been putin the range of  175 million to  250 million.     This estimate is based on thelevel of import prices in 1964-65 compared with the price levels adopted forthe Common Agricultural Policy by the e.c., making due allowance for changes inthe volume of domestic production up to 1972-73 and changes in the level ofUnited Kingdom demand resulting from the higher,e.c. prices.26.   Changes in world prices before entry vrould affect the net cost to thebalance of payments of adopting the c.a.p.     In broad terms, a 5 per cent increase in import prices across the board would reduce the balance ofpayments cost of entry by some  50 million because we should in any event bealready bearing this additional cost at the time of entry.     On the otherhand, insofar as world prices fell, as for some commodities they might,we should be foregoing the gain which would accrue to our balance wf payments under our present system and the cost of entry would thus be correspondinglygreater.-8-
27.   If world food prices should rise while we were operating ourpresent agricultural support system of deficiency payments, the cost of thesupport system to the Exchequer would fall while the balance of paymentsburden of our food imports v/ould rise;    and the higher import prices would be reflected in the cost of living.     If world food prices were to rise, and wewere a member of the Community, the higher cost of imports from third countries would be offset by the lower cost of levy payments to the Community1sAgricultural Fund, since the variable levies would fall pari passu with therise in import prices - so long as the Community&apos;s price arrangements remained unchanged.     And there would be no cost-of-living effect, nor any greaterstimulus to domestic food production.     The Community&apos;s agricultural system is,in fact, insulated against outside change as ours is noti28.   The Community might in such a situation be disposed to raise its ownproducer prices;    and this may vie 11 happen anyway if the movement of prices ingeneral and of wages should continue to be upwards with the inevitableconsequences for agricultural costs.     As to world food prices, there arefactors which could make for higher levels in the 1970s for cereals and beef,though such factors are not in evidence for dairy products, sheep-meat andpigmeat and fruit;   while the outlook for world sugar prices is quiteuncertain, depending as it does upon the possibility of negotiating aninternational agreement for the control of production and sales.     Thosecommodities (including tropical foods) for which prices might increasecomprise rather less than half our total import bill.     Therefore an increaseof rather more than 10 per cent in the prices of these commodities would benecessary to achieve the same impact of  50 million on the balance of payments as would be achieved by a 5 per cent increase in food import prices generally.Cost of Living;29.   If we were to apply as they stand the Community&apos;s present arrangements andthe prices envisaged thereunder, retail food prices in the United kingdom would rise because (a) consumers would have to meet the full cost of home-produced food (now carried in part by the taxpayer under the deficiency round system) and (b) the prices of imported food would be raised to thehigher Community levels (for third country supplies this would be by means oflevy).    After allowing for changes in the pattern of consumption induced bythe adoption of Community arrangements and prices, it is estimated that our food costs might rise by some  400-4-50 million at the wholesale stage.     Giventhe uncertainty about the extent of any consequential addition for processors&apos;and distributors&apos; margins (e.g. on account of the higher inventory value oftheir stocks) the total increase at the retail stage could be anything from about  550 million to  770 million - equivalent to some 10 to 14 per cent onretail food costs of about  5500 million, or 2-g- to 3z Per cent on the cost ofliving.
PART IIPossibilities of Easement of our Agricultural Difficulties30.   It became clear on the Prime minister&apos;s tour of Community capitals,as the Cabinet were informed, that we could not hope to alter the basicelements of the common agricultural policy.     The following paragraphsexamine what might be done, short of this, to safeguard essential interests the Situation on Prices31.   Tne main problem our farming industry would face within the community is not tnat overall production would fall, but that our pattern ofproduction would be disrupted because the Community&apos;s pattern of prices is so different from our own.     For the United Kingdom the Communityfs prices for cereals are much too high and its livestock prices (beef excepted) too low.     Cereals are capital-intensive and livestock generallylabour-intensive - though the small livestock, especially fowls, whichcan be kept in very large units are becoming the former rather than thelatter.     The United Kingdom has a more mechanised farming industry, theCommunity has much more farm manpower and even today a largely peasanteconomy.     These conditions may well change with improved farm structure in the Community;   but within the period that we should have to adjust tothe common agricultural policy they cannot be expected to change enoughto ease our problem significantly.32. The Six are committed to re-negotiation, by the end of 1969* Qf theirinterim arrangements for the Guidance and Guarantee Eund but this does not imply a re-negotiation of their commodity arrangements. Price levels are fixed every year but early major changes in the, price relationships of the major commodities are not to be expected. Any alterations we were ableto secure would have to be piecemeal over a period.Transitional Period33.   The United Kingdom&apos;s farm problem would therefore remain.     So, too,would the balance of payments and the cost-of-living problems.     We couldslow their impact by negotiating an adequate transitional period for moving from our farm support system and our price levels to the Community^
This would anyway be essential.     We could not scrap our system and increase our wheat price, for instance, by 40.per cent overnight.     The Six arcevidently ready to agree to a transitional period.     The question is how long it should be and what we could negotiate.     The Six will effectivelyhave had a period of some seven years to make ready for the full impact of the c.a.p.     YYith our very different system of farm support, and withmajor price changes to make, we could reasonably aim to secure no less aperiod.     We do not think it appropriate to consider in this paper what our negotiating position should be.     It is clear that the longer the transitional period the more manageable would be the cost-of-livingimpact of the ca-p.  (estimated at 2^- to 3^ per cent);    the full balanceof payments cost would likewise be incurred more gradually;   and if thesame transitional period were to apply to Commonwealth food imports forwhich special arrangements were not to be made, this v/ould ease thatproblem.Commodity Regulations34.   Community farm prices are not, however, the whole of the agriculturalproblem.     There are also the commodity regulations for the organisationof the markets for farm produce, and these too the Six would expect usto accept.     For some commodities we should be faced with problems whichare not related, or directly related, to the prices set for thosecommodities.     We would refer particularly to these commodities.(a)   Milk and Milk Products35.   Our system of market organisation is very different from that ofthe Community.     Yfe have a guaranteed price for liquid milk but not for milk products such as butter and cheese, which yield only theworld price to our dairy producers.     There is consequently every incentive to the Milk Marketing Boards, which market the milk for producers, tosupply the liquid market in preference to others;    and the returns to producers are seasonally varied so as to encourage the production of milkin the winter months, when it is more expensive to produce, sufficiently to ensure an adequate liquid supply.-11-
36,   The Community system does not give primacy to the liquid milk market,,Only one-third of their output, against two-thirds in the United Kingdom, goesto that market.     The remaining two-thirds goes for butter and cheese andother milk products, and their producers receive much the same prices for milk for those products as they do for liquid milk for the home.     Three other points are pertinent.     Firstly, the Community might question the retention ofthe collective marketing system of the Milk Marketing Boards as being contraryto the strict letter of Community doctrine;    and milk producers would then have to sell to local dairies, who would have little or no incentive to supply the liquid market in preference to others.     Secondly, the Community milkprice for producers is now&quot; somewhat lower than our own, while our producerswould have higher feed costs - because of the higher cereals prices - in theCommunity;    so the maintenance of our present volume, of produccion would bein jeopardy.     Thirdly, the Community&apos;s system would foster summer ratherthan winter milk production.37,   Clearly we should be likely to face a winter shortage of liquid milk forthe housewife.     Nor could we be at all sure that the shortage could be met from elsewhere in the Community.     This vrould create social and political difficulties, and there would at the least have to be some understanding that acceptance of the Community&apos;s milk regulation and milk price should not beallowed to bring about an insufficient supply of liquid milk for the Britishconsumer.     The rational solution vrould be for us to maintain our existing arrangements for liquid milk including the present powers of the milk marketing Boards, while accepting the Community1 s regime for milk products.We would hope that the Community&apos; s new-found pragmatism would be helpful in finding a solution.38.   The special arrangement required for the continued supply of New Zealandbutter and cheese would also bear upon the operation of the Community&apos;s milk and milk products regulation;   but the meeting of New Zealand&apos;s needs wouldnot remove the United Kingdom&apos;s liquid milk problem.(b) Sugar39.   The Community&apos;s sugar regulation provides for national sugar quotas for members, and a quota would fall to be fixed for the United Kingdom.     TheCommunity&apos;s sugar price is higher than the present United Kingdom price.United Kingdom beet production should therefore be able to expand in some measure and we should seek to provide for this.     At the same time we shouldwant to arrange for supplies from the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement (CSA)countries to be continued to the United Kingdom market, for which they atpresent have assurances up to the end of 1974-     Present CSA supplies and united Kingdom production together meet almost the whole of the United
Kingdom&apos;s consumption.     In the interests of other members the Communitymight therefore prove willing to meet our C3A request, if at all, only at theexpense of the United Kingdom quota.     Accordingly we should need to establishgenerally before entry not only the C8A position but also that of theUnited Kingdom.     The position on sugar is exceedingly complex and would necessarily be the subject of extensive detailed negotiations after entry.(c) Pij^meattft.   As stated in paragraph 18 above, in an enlarged Community our producerswould face greater instability of returns if there were no interventionarrangements.     The Community are thinking of introducing such arrangements,and this would accord with our needs.The Problem of Adjustment41.   Assuming a lengthy transitional period of moving to the c.a.p., and the safeguarding of our position under the commodity regulations where this was essential, considerable numbers of our present farm enterprises would stillbecome uneconomic over the transitional period, particularly in dairying, pigand poultry keeping and horticulture - and hill and upland farming if thespecial forms of help they now receive should not prove admissible in theCommunity.     The West and Worth would in general be hit harder than the Southand East.     These farmers would either have to go out or svri-tch to other types of production, and this would require fresh capital investment for which thesmaller farmers at least would not have the resources.     There would be aserious problem of replanning much of our farming, and this could not be done under the existing support system at the Annual Reviews since that system wouldbe being phased out.     Special assistance for readjustment to the c.a.p. wouldbe necessary through some scheme of production replanning grants.     Me should require recognition of this need by the Six and ^should also seek their acceptance that the cost of the production replanning grants could properlyfall as a charge upon the Community&apos;s Agricultural Fund.     If this could be negotiated the balance of payments cost of the c.a.p. would be lessenedover the transitional period, during which the production replanning grantswould need to be payable.-13-
The Balance of Payments Problemifi.   At        en(^ of        transitional period, however, we should still he left with the full burden of the balance of payments cost of the c.a.p. which hasbeen tentatively estimated as being between  1 75 million and  250 million ayear.    A way would need to be found of reducing the balance of payments costvdthout running full tilt against Community doctrine.     This night be done bypressing the Six to accept an arrangement under which the cost of our production grants would be met without limit of tine from the Community&apos;s AgriculturalFund,    These production grants are an integral part of our support system and at present amount to some  115 million a year - over and above the deficiency payments which account for the other  140 million of the cost ofagricultural support.     Some of these production grants would be likely to prove consonant with the c.a.pw and others not.     vie night have to accept that we should be reimbursed only for those production grants which were allowed to be continued;    but we should bid for the reimbursement of ourpresent expenditure, with the idea, that any production grants which provedincompatible with the c.a.p, would be replaced by others.     If this could be negotiated the balance of payments cost of the c.a.p. would be permanentlydiminished;    and there would also be substantial savings to the Exchequer,over and above what was being saved on the deficiency payments, which would thus have the means of meeting the cost of the production replanning grants ifthe Community were net willing to take them on charge as well as the existingproduction grants.     It should however be borne in mind that since in principlelevy payments are to be made after the transitional period not to theAgricultural Fund but &quot;to the Community for Community purposes&quot;, there nayhe possibilities of alleviating the balance of payments problemelsewhere than in the agricultural field   (e.g. possible recoupmentsfor scientific research or aid to the less developed countries).     In view ofher interest as prime beneficiary froig. the Community Fund, and the potentialmagnitude of the United Kingdom contribution, Prance, for her part, can beexpected to insist that the financial arrangements for the single market stage(ise, after 1969) should be defined before our entry, thus covering the UnitedKingdom&apos;s position.Annual Review43.   Lastly, there would be need to persuade the Six to agree to theintroduction of a form of Annual Review for the better guidance a.nd directionof the c.a.p.     The National Earners&apos; Unions attach great importance to this;the previous G-overnnent pushed it hard in the 1962-3 negotiation;    there areclear signs that the Commission (and the French farmers&apos; organisations) are well disposed;    and a Review arrangement would make good sense.     By an annual review is meant an annual study of the economic condition and prospects ofagriculture which would serve as a guide for any necessary adjustments of farm prices for the different commodities.     This v/ould need to be conducted at
at Community level with appropriate participation on the part of famorganisations.     The Community Review night well he preceded by reviewsconducted by the Member States at national level, which should assist the overall Review.     This could be a most valuable means not only of associatingthe farm organisations of the Community with the development of the common agricultural policy but also of making the operation of the c,a.p. more flexible and responsive to changes of circumstance.
ANNEX AMain Features of e.c. Arrangements for Commodities other than Cereals1,.     The regulation for &quot;beef and live cattle provides for common guideprices (v/hich it is considered farmers on average should receive in a normal year) supported by a common external tariff and variable importlevies, by support buying at the discretion of Member States - withinprescribed price limits - and by export subsidies.2. The regulation for milk and milk products reflects the fact that the dairy industry in the Community, unlike that in the United Kingdom, isorientated primarily to the manufacturing rather than the liquid consump-tion market. There is a target price, which the system aims to yieldto Community producers, for all milk sold during the year, through theoperation of levies on imported dairy products, market intervention on certain products and export subsidies.3.     For pigs and pig products, poultry and, eggs, there are no targetprices.     Imports from third countries are subject to levies comprisingan element of protective duty plus a variable amount representing the prevailing difference between feed grain prices inside and outside theConmunity.     Supplementary levies are imposed if frontier prices ofimports fall below prescribed minimum levels (sluice-gate prices) basedon reasonable costs of production.     A proposal for market interventionarrangements is being considered for pigs, but not apparently for poultryor eggs.4.     The Community has not yet made a regulation governing the common market organisation for sugar, but it has agreed on the main features ofthe arrangements, which are basically similar to those for cereals.There are to be target and intervention prices for refined sugar, athreshold price and a variable levy on imports from non-Community sources(the French Overseas Departments counting as part of the Community forthis purpose).     In addition, there is to be a minimum beet price for community growers and, between 1968-69 and 1975-76, production quotas on both a national and a factory basis.     Limits are placed on theCommunity&apos;s financial responsibility for market intervention and export subsidies.5.     Under the Community&apos;s regulations for horticultural produce, tariffsbetween Member States have to be eliminated and a common external tariffintroduced.     For fruit and vegetables connon standards of quality arebeing applied to produce sold within the Community;    support-buying and
export subsidisation, at Community expense, is provided for in respect ofsome commodities;    there are minimum import prices, enforced by counter-vailing duties and on occasions suspension of imports, for produce from third countries;    and financial assistance for the formation of growers&apos;co-operatives to operate schemes for compensating growers holding produceoff the market to sustain reserve prices.     A market regulation fornon-edible horticultural produce is due to be introduced by July i968.6.     So far, there is no common market regulation for potatoes; protection from third-country imports is afforded by the common external tariff.Nor is there yet any regulation for mutton and lamb (on which there is acommon external tariff of 20 per cent):    the Community treats wool as an industrial product, and there is a nil duty on raw wool.
