THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1967C(6V23 Copy No.    Cfi9th March, 1967 00CABINETFAMILY endowment memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer as my colleagues know, when we discussed family endowmentin Cabinet on 23rd February (CC (67) 9th Conclusions, Minute 4),I indicated that while, whatever my personal views, I could not dissent from the view of the majority in favour of an increase in family allowances, I must reserve my position on the method bywhich it should be financed.2. I think I should now make clear to my colleagues the reasonsfor my reservation, so that they may understand the consequences of going forward with a decision.3. To increase family allowances by. 10s. a week for each child except the first for every family in the country from 1st April1968 would be to increase total Exchequer expenditure by  160million. The method of financing put forward is to cover the bulkof the increase by raising Income Tax by reducing the child allowances -and to meet the rest by increasing other forms oftaxation. This is the reality extra expenditure of  160 millionrequiring extra taxation of the same amount \which should not beobscured in our discussions, and cannot be obscured publicly, bylooking only at the net difference between the amount to be spent in total and the amount to be raised from Income Tax.4. On the expenditure side we are saying in effect that in considering the pattern of our public expenditure as a whole we wishto give further priority to social security benefits over other formsof expenditure. We should not overlook the extent to which wehave already moved in this direction with the improvements we havemade in the system in spite of the difficulties of the last two years-improvements which, with the uprating proposed for later this year,will have added over  700 million to the annual bill.5. Before we finally decide to add another  160 million it seemsto me only sensible that we should consider the effect of this ontotal public expenditure over the next few years, and on the relativepriorities we shall be attaching to this form of expenditure as against further expenditure to support our economic policy, education, health,7710
2SECREThousing, roads, defence and. the,other programmes. Indeed, we have authorised a special review of all public, sector expenditure with justthis in mind-recognising first that, with the slower growth in our total national resources that we now foresee, there must be some reduction in the growth of total public expenditure, and secondlythat there is a need for a conscious deliberate reshaping of ourpriorities. The results of the official work we have authorised willbe coming to us in a few months&apos; time and by mid-summer we shallbe in a position to take comprehensive and carefully-thought-outdecisions. At that time I should be sympathetic to a further increase in social security benefits, especially if it can be directed to those in greatest need, provided the balance of argument showsthat it can be done without too much detriment to our other programmes, or to the growth of the rest of the economy. Butto decide it finally now, before we can see the consequences, wouldbe to take a leap in the dark which we might well regret when theconsequences for other programmes become clear.6. I see the problem this way because I hold to twopropositions:(a) the maximum increase in taxation rates which would betolerable between now and 1970 is about  300 million;(b) to limit the increase to this figure requires a reduction ofabout  500 million in the total public expenditure programmes by 1970.These are the hypotheses which have been accepted by my colleagues for the review of expenditure to which I have referred. While i recognise that they may be modified in detail when we come to take our final decisions, it is as clear as it can be that we cannot accommodatean additional increase in taxation of  160 million. For this reason the only hypothesis on which I could accept an increase in family allowances of  160 million is that there will be an equivalentreduction in other programmes. This is the only method of financingwhich seems to me compatible with maintaining, in a period ofslower growth than we had hoped for, a tolerable balance betweenthe public and private sectors. In short and this is what I wantmy colleagues to understand I am not prepared to finance thisextra expenditure by an increase in taxation, over and above the increases that are already likely to be necessary in later years.7. Even so, the result would not be wholly satisfactory. Weshould have accepted a reduction in some of our programmes schools, housing or whatever it might be in order to make room for an increase in family allowances, the bulk of which would goto families who do not need it, and have not asked for it. It wouldalso be elector ally unpopular. This would be the result of accepting the views of those of my colleagues who are opposed to income-testedbenefits in this field and who maintain their opposition in spite ofthe fact that income tests have been devised and accepted in other fields, for example, rate rebates and the encouragement of localauthorities to introduce rent rebate schemes. My own view is thatif our social programmes are to go forward, and help is to be given
where it is really needed while keeping taxation within tolerablelimits, the Cabinet will have to face the issue of income-testing andcome to an agreed conclusion on it.8. I must also stress that there is every sign that 1968-69 willbe a very difficult year. We can accommodate a steep rise in public expenditure in this coming financial year, mainly because we areexpecting private investment to be falling and private consumptionto be restrained. In 1968-69, however, we shall hope to see private investment at least ceasing to fall, if not actually rising. We must make room for this; but even if we are successful in slowing down the rate of increase in our public expenditure programmes to theextent I have indicated, to do this by 1968-69 will not be easy andwe may have to face making the whole of the tolerable increase in taxation in that one year perhaps even, if the economy recoversquickly enough, more than the whole, as a temporary measure. Weshall not see the pattern of 1968-69 at all precisely until the autumn of this year, but it is already clear that the Budgetary problem is going to be a difficult one. This is another reason for not taking this decision now.L. J. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,8th March, 1967.
