DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)66C(67) 34 COPY NO._21st March, 1967CABINETTHE AIRBUSMemorandum by the Minister without PortfolioFollowing the discussion of the airbus by the Cabinet on16th March, 1967 (CC(67) 13th Conclusions, Minute 4), I have discussed the issues which require clarification with my colleagues.     One of thenew factors which emerged was the influence the size and number of engines could have on the future of the airbus project.     The UnitedStates airbus, now under consideration by Lockheed, could be poweredeither by two engines, each of more than 40,000 lb. thrust, or by three engines, each with a thrust of about 30,000 lb.    In the formercase, either the Pratt and Whitney JT9D or the new Rolls-RoyceRB 207 would be suitable;  in the latter case, the only suitable enginewould be the projected Rolls-Royce RB 211 (which is also the enginewhich has been proposed for the BAG 211).    Lockheed are expectedto decide whether to adopt two or three engines for their airbus inApril, 1967, but they will not decide for or against a Rolls-Royceengine until some time between July and October.2.       The three main possibilities and their consequences are:(i)   That Lockheed should choose two RB 207 engines.    In this casethe European airbus would similarly be powered by two RB 207s, andthe demands which these orders would place on Rolls-Royce would makeit impossible for them to develop the RB 211 in the same period.(ii) That Lockheed should choose two Pratt and Whitney JT9D engines.In this case the European airbus v/ould be powered by two RB 207engines, but Rolls-Royce would also be capable of developing the rb 211.(iii) That Lockheed should choose three RB 211 engines.     TheEuropean airbus would then be powered by three RB 211s, and the rb 211 would also be available for use in other European aircraft,including the BAG 211.3,       If the RB 207 were adopted for the European airbus, the costof developing the RB 211 ( 55 million) v/ould have to be borne on the bac 211 project, making a total of  105 million for the launching costof the BAC 211.    If on the other hand the RB 211 were to be used in both the European and United States airbuses, only a small part ofthe cost of its development would have to be borne on the BAC 211project.COM FIDE INITIAL
4.       Before deciding whether or not British European Airv/ays (BEA)should be authorised to order the BAG 211, we consider that studies shouldbe put in hand as a matter of urgency in order that the BAG 211, theTrident 3B and the stretched VC 10 can be compared in terms of exportprospects, launching costs, operating costs, profitability to BSA, and total cost to the Exchequer.    It should be noted that if BEA were allowedto purchase the BAC 211 there might be a consequential reduction in their demand for airbuses.5.       Turning to the airbus, it was the general view that, at the tripartite meeting of Ministers on 30th March, the United kingdom should proceed to the project definition stage on the clear understandingby our French and German partners that eventual production could onlybe contemplated if the five following prerequisites were met:(i)  If there is an assured market for 75 airbuses in the three nationalairlines, and if as a result of further market reoearch there isa reasonable expectation of at least 50 sales to other airlines.(ii)  If the present estimate of launching costs is re-examined to see whether a significant reduction can be obtained, and if in anycase it does not exceed  130 million at the conclusion of trieproject definition stage.(iii) If the PvOlls-Royce engine is adopted.(iv) If there is assurance that the target operating costs of 30 percent below current types, and the in-service date of 1972-73,will be achieved.(v)  If the manufacturers will take a proper financial participation,i, e. normal production costs and, say, some 20 per cent ofdevelopment costs.In addition, it was agreed that the following sixth prerequisite should beadded:(vi)  If the capacity of the airbus as first developed does not exceed250 seats.6.       Our negotiators at the Ministerial meeting should be given firminstructions to insist on the acceptance of these conditions, and the adop-tion of a Rolls-Royce engine should be an absolute condition forparticipation by the United Kingdom.    If our prospective partners should propose some modification of the other conditions, where a little flexibilitymight perhaps be acceptable, our negotiators should refer the question backto Ministers.7.      I invite my colleagues to agree that, subject to the acceptance ofthese six conditions, we should proceed to the project definition stage.P.C.G.W.70, Whitehall, S.W.I.21st March, 1967
