Draft White Paper on the Third London Airport1.     The report of the Inspector on the Stansted Public Inquiry andthe Government&apos;s decision on the report have now been made public.This White Paper explains the reasons for the Government1s decision.I - Introduction2.     The Interdepartmental Committee on the Third London Airport, which reported in 1963, found that a third airport would be needed for London,probably in the early 1970s.     They recommended that the new airportshould be suitable for all kinds of traffic and should be capable ofdevelopment to a large capacity without restricting the capacity ofLondon&apos;s present airports.      They found that the area in which such an airport could be sited was severely limited by considerations of air traffic routeing and of ground access.     A large number of sites v/ereconsidered by the Committee, over a dozen of them in some detail;    and ofthese they concluded that Stansted, though not ideal, was by far the mostsuitable for a third major airport for London.     Stansted&apos;s mainadvantages were, they considered, that -(a) its choice would permit the development of a satisfactory airrouteing system for both Heathrow and the new airport,(b) part of the site was already in use as an airport and the surrounding terrain was suitable for airport development,and   (c)    in comparison with the principal alternatives it was near to London and had the promise of satisfactory access.3.     In publishing the report on the Interdepartmental Committee in 1964,the previous administration endorsed their conclusion that Stansted wasthe right site for London&quot;s third airport.     Full public discussion ofthe report was expected and welcomed.     As part of this process ofdiscussion, the present Government appointed an independent Inspector,Mr. G. D. Blake, M.A., F.R.I.C.S., F.A.I., to hold a public local inquiry to hear and report upon local objections to the proposal.     On aviationmatters of a technical nature the Inspector had the assistance of a technical Assessor, Mr. J. W. S. Branclcer.4.     The Inquiry opened on 6th December 1965 and ended on 11thFebruary 1966, after sitting for 31 days in all.     Its purpose was
defined as follows:-&quot;To hear and report on local objections relating to the suitability of the choice o  Stansted for an airport and theeffect of the proposed development on local interests.     Itwill be open to objectors to suggest modifications to the out-lined scheme of development or to propose alternative sites,but not to question the need to provide a third major airport toserve London.&quot;5.     The Inspector submitted his report at the end o  May 1966.     he did not give a firm recommendation either for or against developmentof Stansted as London&apos;s third airport, but considered that a further review should be undertaken of the whole problem.     In the ensuingmonths the Government accordingly carried out, in the light of the inspector&apos;s suggestion, a comprehensive and searching re-examinationthe many complex issues.     The results are set out in the Sectionsthat follow.
H - Need for a third London airportTraffic forecasts and capacity at the London airports6.     The need for a third London airport depends fundamentally on two considerations - the capacity of the existing major London airports(Heathrow and Gatwick) and the likely growth of the traffic wishing touse them.7.     The capacity of an airport, measured in terms of aircraft movements(i.e.  landings and take-offs) per hour, depends, first, on the number and layout of its runways and their dimensions;    secondly on the air traffic control procedures in operation (which are governed in turn byprevailing weather conditions, by the state of navigational technology and by considerations of safety);     thirdly, on local factors, such asthe existence of other active aerodromes nearby and the sensitivity ofthe surrounding area to noise.     When credit is taken for the improvementsthat can be expected in ATC and piloting procedures and technology,these considerations point to maximum sustainable hourly capacities inall weathers at the existing two London airports of 64 movements an hour at Heathrow and 45 movements an hour at Gatwick in the early yearsof the next decade.     Higher rates of movement than this will be achievedfrom time to time, but if a higher sustainable capacity is used forairport planning an unacceptably high incidence of delay and diversionwill result.8.     The figures of capacity given above, however, presuppose a numberof projected developments;    but it is not yet certain that all of them will materialise.     They assume, for instance, the lengthening of theNo. 1 runway at Heathrow and the constructions of a second runway atGatwick, both of which may be the subject of public inquiries;    theyassume the extension westwards of the controlled airspace of the LondonTerminal Area, and the successful operation of new air traffic controlprocedures that have yet to be fully proved, notably the scheme for theindependent use of parallel runways    at Heathrow;    and they assume no significant change in the degree of restriction on the capacity of either airport arising from noise control measures.     Thus, the figures given above represent the highest rate of movements it will be possible
to sustain;    in practice any one of several factors may cause actualcapacity to fall short of this.9.     The next step in assessing the need for the third London airportis to produce forecasts of the growth of London&apos;s air traffic over thenext 15 years.10.     The forecasts contained in the Report of the interdepartmental committee on the Third London Airport (which were prepared in 1962-63)have accordingly been reviewed and new forecasts produced.     These newforecasts are based in the first place on an analysis of the growth ofUnited Kingdom air traffic in the pasty taking into accoimt actualtraffic figures in the years since the preparation of the previouslypublished forecasts.     An examination has also been made of the totalmarket in the United Kingdom for international travel and the share that air transport has occupied, and might in future occupy;    and account hasbeen taken of the likely effect of the Channel Tunnel.     On that basisthree forecasts of air passengers using the London airports have been devised - forecasts almost certain to be exceeded (the &quot;lower limit&quot;),forecasts unlikely to be exceeded (the &quot;upper limit&quot;),  \nd most likelyforecasts.     The future size and average loading of aircraft have been estimated, including the use of &quot;jumbo&quot; jets, and this data has been used to convert the forecasts of passenger traffic into forecasts of aircraft movements.11.     The tables in Appendix 1 show the traffic figures for London overthe past six years and the forecast of London&apos;s traffic from now until1980.     They also provide an indication of the present division oftraffic between London and Gatwick and a forecast of how Heathrow&apos;straffic will develop in the next few years.12.     Table 2 of Appendix 1 shows that on.the most likely forecast ofthe traffic growth Heathrow traffic will exceed airport capacity in1970.     By further spreading of peaks and by transferring movementsto Gatwick, this date can be put back;    but in the absence of such measures, the third airport would have to be in operation by 1969, sinceat least one year is needed for the orderly transfer of movements to it.
The question therefore is:    how far can the growth of Heathrow&apos;s trafficafter 1969 be absorbed by   further peak spreading at Heathrow or by theuse of spare capacity at Gatwick?13.     For many years now there has been some peak spreading at Heathrow,and the problem is to assess how far it is possible to continue theprocess of peak spreading and yet offer an adequate service to airlinesand their passengers.     It is clearly impracticable to expect traffic tomove from the summer peak to the winter trough, or to expect passengerswho are seeking a speedy mode of transport to change their chosen day oftravel to any significant extent,14.     There remains therefore the possibility of spreading peaks throughthe hours of the day.     This depends first on the amount of sparecapacity in the non-peak periods (the &quot;troughs&quot;) of the day - Heathrow&apos;capacity during the night hours,  11.30 p.m. to 6.00 a.m., is alreadystrictly limited by the Government in the interest of noise control;secondly on the extent to which airlines can spread their schedules;    and thirdly on the ability of the air traffic control system to handle the resultant pattern of demand.     There are obviously uncertainties in theevaluation of these factors;    but after a careful study the government considers that, against the rate of traffic increase foreshadowed by the&quot;most likely&quot; forecasts in Table 1 of Appendix 1, enforced peak-spreadingat Heathrow could postpone the need for new airport facilities by up to three years.15.     The scope for the transfer of services to Gatwick after Heathrowhas reached saturation will depend on the capacity available at Gatwick,and this will depend on whether a second runway can be provided.     with one runway Gatwick has, in theory, the potential to accept three yearsgrowth from Heathrow.     With two runways Gatwick would, at most, have a five-year potential.    How far this potential cound in fact be realisedcannot be precisely determined at. present, but it will hinge upon howfar airlines have scope for moving individual services, or blocks of services, to Gatwick.     This in turn would be affected by the likelihood that in future years these (or other services) would again be moved toa third airport.     Taking these considerations into account the
Government believes that transfers of traffic from Heathrow to Gatwickmight put off the need for a third London airport by two to four years,depending on the availability of a second runway at Gatwick.16.     By applying those estimated postponements to the date by whicha new London airport would otherwise have been required - 1969 - wearrive at a new date of 1974 or 1976.     This date cannot, however, beregarded as a reliable estimate of when a third London airport will berequired:    it assumes not only that it will prove possible to expand bothHeathrow and Gatwick to their full planned capacities - and this, as explained above in para. 8, is by no means certain - but also that itproves possible to achieve the degree of peak-spreading contemplated inparagraph 14 above.     The assumptions made here about movement rate,peak-spreading, and transfers to Gatwick point to the mid-1970s as thetime by which a third London airport would be required for a substantial volume of traffic.     Were any of the assumptions invalidated, the interdepartmental Committee&apos;s forecast of &quot;the early 1970s&quot; would be themost likely estimate.17.     The Government is therefore convinced that there are no grounds forexpecting that the need for a new airport to serve London can be post-poned beyond the middle years of the next decade, and believes that inpractice the requirement for the airport, may come rather earlier than this development of regional airports and air services18.     The question of the need for a third London airport was explicitlyexcluded from the scope of the Public Inquiry (see para. 4 above).Nevertheless it is often suggested - and the Inspector himself hinted atthe possibility in his report, paragraphs 46 and 47 - that the need fora third London airport could be avoided, or at any rate indefinitelypostponed, by the further, and possibly induced, development of regionalairports and air services.     Superficially, this is an attractiveproposition from the point of view both of London and of the mainprovincial centres.     It conflicts, however, with the weight of available evidence.19.     First, it is clear that most of the problems the regions may have
in respect of civil aviation are connected with air services rather thanairports.     Nearly every part of the country is already provided with good aerodrome facilities, which are, except in the case of London&apos;s mainairports, generally under-utilised and uneconomic, while Prestwiclc and manchester (as developed) afford good facilities for intercontinentalservices.20.     The argument must be, therefore, that provincial air services should be promoted and developed in order to avoid the need for a third london airport and this in turn relies on the assumption that much ofLondon&apos;s present traffic is, in fact, potential provincial trafficcompelled to pass through the London airports because London is the onlycentre with the required spread and frequency of services.    This does not correspond with the realities of the situation.     Air services at Londonand at the provincial centres are complementary.     The- Government seeks to encourage the development and growth of air services both in the regions and in the growing market in London and the South-East.    Subjectto the obtaining of traffic rights from other countries where necessary,it is for the airlines to mount and operate air services whenever theyforesee a demand that can be met economically.    Experience has shown thatthe airlines are in fact prepared to run commercial risks by starting upunprofitable services where there is a reasonable hope that the trafficwill before too long build up to a profitable level.21.     Furthermore, a survey conducted for.,,the Board of Trade by the social survey in 1965, of the origin and destination in the United Kingdom ofinternational passengers passing through Heathrow and Gatwick, indicated that as much as 80 per cent of London&apos;s international traffic isgenerated by the London conurbation and South-East England.*     This survey was not conducted on such a scale that its results can be accepted as ofgreat precision but it gives sound indications of the broad orders of magnitude.     In addition, the continuing International Passenger survey of the Board of Trade provides some evidence in confirmation:    it*In this context the expression &quot;South-East England&quot; means the areacovered by the South-East and East Anglia Economic Planning Regions.
shows that two thirds of the holiday visits and three quarters of thebusiness and other visits by overseas residents arc spent in one locationin the United Kingdom.     London is the most popular place for all suchvisits.     Of visitors travelling by air about 60% stay at London only.      (doubt that London is the main attraction for the substantial number of overseas residents travelling on international flights into and out of theLondon area airports.,22.     If? then, say 20 per cent of London&apos;s international passenger traffic is generated by regions outside South-East England this might amount to a demand for direct services between the regions and abroaof a little over one million one-way seats a year at present trafficlevels, or about 3 million one-way seats a year by 1975.     In fact, ofcourse, some of the international travellers generated by the regionswill always wish to pass through London for personal or business reasons.It is, therefore, only the residue that represent the true frustrateddemand for direct air services between regional airports and abroad.But these passengers do not represent demand at any one regional airport;they are spread throughout all parts of the United Kingdom.     Moreover,the potential demand at any one regional airport is further greatlyfragmented because of the very many different destinations to whichpassengers wish to travel.     Thus, the potential demand for new directservices between regional airports and overseas is split up into fragmentsmost of which are so small as not in the foreseeable future economicallyto justify a direct air service.     It is likely that, at most, a fifth of the total potential demand - say 250,000 one-way passengers now,rising to 600,000 in 1975 - represents demand that it may be practicable,by one means or another, to divert from London to regional airports.Passenger traffic of this order, however, corresponds to no more than half of one year&apos;s growth of traffic through London, so that its diversion to regional airports could only defer the requirement for a third london airport for, at the most, one year.23.     There is no doubt that the number of services operating directlybetween regional airports and overseas will continue to increase, as ithas in the past.     The Government welcomes this trend, and has taken full the remainder, half include London in their itinerary.There is not
account of it in the traffic forecasts given earlier in this Section;but it is nevertheless forced to the conclusion that this factor v/illnot significantly affect the need for a third London airport or thedate by which it will be required.The significance of freight traffic24.     The current fast growth of air freight has lately received publicity,and has provoked the suggestion that the right way to handle freight traffic in the long-term may be to build an airport, not necessarily close-to London, that would be devoted entirely, or almost entirely, to the handling of air freight and would serve as an air freight centre for thewhole country.   Whatever the merits   of this idea, it is unlikely for thereasons given below to affect the dates when the London airport will berequired, set out in paragraph 16.25.     In the first place the recent fast growth of air freight has onlytaken place at the London airports;    it has not been reflected in otherparts of the country.     Secondly, it is noteworthy that more:han half     Df air freight is carried on passenger flights:    not only doesthis immediately tie a large proportion of freight handling to passengerairports, but it also creates a bias in favour of the handling of all-cargo aircraft at the same airports because of the need, which the airlines recognise, for a fully integrated freight service includingexpeditious interchange arrangements.     Moreover, whether or not thegrowth of all-cargo operations at the London airports continues, thegrowth of London&apos;s passenger traffic forecast   in Appendix 1will by itself necessitate the provision of a third London airport bythe mid-1970s.
III - Role of the third London airport26.   In Appendix 1 to the report on the Public Inquiry (paragraph 47) itis suggested that no thought has been given to the possibility of using the projected airport for short haul traffic only.     As the report says,this possibility, if accepted, would mean that there could be a limita-tion on the length of runways required and, therefore, other sites thanthose mentioned at the Inquiry could come into consideration.     Thisview is not entirely consistent with the suggestion in paragraph 45 ofthe same Appendix that the site for the third London airport should be capable *f being enlarged.     In fact much thought has been given to the role of the proposed airport.Nature of traffic at the third airport27.   Apart from Heathrow the United Kingdom possesses only two airportsplanned to cater for all kinds of long haul operations - Prestwick and manchester.     For London and the South East generally there is anothermajor airport at Gatwick, but apart from diversions it is suitable only for short and medium haul traffic.     Gatwiclcfs present runway is considerably shorter than the two main runways at Heathrow and, thoughit can be extended, the topographical features of the site will neverallow it - or the projected second runway - to accept all kinds of longhaul traffic without restrictions.     This means that the role of&apos; Gatwickwill continue to be that of an airport for short and medium haul servicesand for diversions.     Its position south of London makes it eminentlysuitable to cater for the numerous services of this type between Londonand western Europe.28.   The density of development around Heathrow and the noise problemarising from its particular situation make it almost impossible todevelop Heathrow further by the construction of additional parallelrunways.     Thus, when Heathrow becomes saturated, more and more of itsgrowing traffic will have to be transferred to Gatwick and (later) to thethird London airport.     If neither Gatwick nor the third airport were able to take long-haul aircraft, the whole of the transfer would consistof short and medium   haul services.     This would progressively upset thebalance of services that continue to be provided at Heathrow, turning
it increasingly into an exclusively long haul airport.     The effects ofthis would be that:(a) interchange facilities at Heathrow would be progressively reduced;(b) the inevitable moves from Heathrow to one of the other Londonairports by foreign, as well as British, airlines operatingshort-haul services would be even more unpopular than other-wise, and in that situation retaliation must be expectedagainst our national airlines in foreign countries;(c) traffic growth at the London airports would be stuntedbecause long and short-haul services act as feeders to one another and some passengers would prefer to change services at, say, Paris and Amsterdam rather than suffer the inconven-ience of long journeys between London&apos;s airports;(d) the revenues of airlines using London - notably of course,British airlines - would suffer, and so, consequently, would the revenues of the British Airports Authority;(e) passengers having no other choice open to them would have to travel between the London airports, thereby addingunnecessarily to traffic on the ground;(f) all this would reduce London1s attractiveness as an inter-national air traffic centre and interchange point, with long-term adverse effects on our tourist trade.29.   For all these reasons, and to provide the greatest flexibility forthe organisation of London&apos;s air traffic as far ahead as possible, thethird London airport should be multi-purpose (i.e. it should cater forlong, medium and short haul services, both passenger and freight).   a multi-purpose airport also needs to be able to cater efficiently fortraffic to all points of the compass, or as near that ideal as practicablCapacity of the third airport30.   It has been suggested that the new airport should be big enough tomeet all London&apos;s future air traffic needs, so as to release the groundoccupied by existing airports for other purposes and to remove the disturbance created by air traffic to an area where it would be of
little importance. The Government has investigated the practicability of providing such an airports31.   To meet London&apos;s forecast traffic demand in the 1980s, an airportincorporating three pairs of parallel runways would be needed.      (Thenumber of runways would be greater if they were not all parallel.)Such an airport would have to be at least four miles in width, in orderto ensure safe separation in the air for three parallel traffic streams.This compares with one and a half miles for an airport with two pairsof parallel runways.     Moreover, in order to achieve a simple groundmovement pattern, the airport might well extend in length to sevenmiles.     An airport with not all its runways parallel would require an even larger area, as the runways would have to be sited so as not to cross, nor to be crossed by, taxiways.32.   Thus a single London airport would require a very large site.The search for a suitable site for the third London airport has shownthat no area of the size required for an airport at which more than two pairs of parallel runways could be in use at any one time existswithin convenient reach of London.     In consequence it will not bepossible to build an airport capable of taking all London&apos;s traffic inthe 1980s.     It may also be undesirable, since a very large airportwould give rise to considerable difficulties in the ground handling of aircraft and in the transfer of passengers to and from the city centre.33.   Nevertheless, the great difficulties experienced in providing andagreeing a site for a third London airport make it desirable that thisthird airport should ultimately be capable of development to thelargest practicable capacity - namely to that of two pairs of parallelrunways.
IV - Consideration of the Inspector&apos;s Report34,   There is, then, in the Government&apos;s view no doubt about the need to establish by the mid-1970s a new large and multipurpose internationalairport to serve London-     The question to be decided is whether, in thelight of the Inspector&apos;s report and subsequent investigations, there is any acceptable alternative to Stansted   as the site for such an airport.35.   The Inspector&apos;s terms of reference requested him to &quot;hear andreport on local objections&quot;.     Objections were raised mainly on thegrounds of noise, the effects of the possible level of road traffic,town and country planning including the loss of the district&apos;s ruralcharacter, loss of farmland, and decline in house values.36.   The Inspector came to the conclusion that to place a major airportat Stansted  &quot;v/ould be a calamity for the neighbourhood&quot; and &quot;couldonly be justified by national necessity&quot;.     In his view the proposal&quot;succeeded on the viability of air traffic&quot; but there were strong arguments against it for other reasons.     He concluded that &quot;a reviewof the whole problem should be undertaken by a committee equallyinterested in traffic in the air, traffic on the ground, regional planning and national planning&quot;.     The review, he said, should covermilitary as well as civil aviation.37*.   A full summary of the Inspector&apos;s findings is set out in Appendix under the headings of air traffic control, road and rail access, noise,loss of agricultural land, house values,&apos; regional planning, and national planning.     The Government&apos;s conclusions on these findings are set out point by point in Appendix 3.38.   Apart from the difficulties of noise, access and loss of agricul-tural land, which would for the most part apply to any site withinrange of London, the Government was particularly concerned to give full weight to the regional planning objections.     Although Stansted  was mentioned in the South East Study as a possible site for a new town,the Government would not have chosen without the airport to put a major growth point in this relatively unspoilt part of north Essex,but would have preferred a site for the airport on the Thames estuaryor somewhere to the north-west of London between London and Birmingham&apos;.
39.   The Government therefore decided that it ought to go verythoroughly into all the possibilities before reaching a decision. :,There were two ways in which this might be done - by an independentcommission, to whom evidence would need to be submitted by all theparties concerned, or by a review carried out by the Government itself.40.    The Government decided against an independent commission.     Inthe first place, a decision either for or against Stansted was becomingurgent.     Furthermore the Interdepartmental Committee on the third london Airport had already made a thorough examination of the question in 1962 and 1963;    the subsequent publication of their report and thePublic Inquiry itself gave an ample and well-used opportunity to allinterests outside the Government to put forward their own points ofview.     Accordingly, nothing useful seemed likely to be achieved byinitiating a further round of public discussion of the same material.Not only would such a procedure inevitably have been very time-consuming, but it would also have involved both the Government and allthe other interested parties in renewed work and expense in preparingand submitting evidence;    and at the end of the day the decision would still have been for the Government to make.41.   Nevertheless, the Government thought it right to accept the inspectors recommendation and decided therefore to carry out thefurther review itself.     The review brought in the branches ofGovernment representing all the interests mentioned by the Inspectorin his recommendation - civil and military aviation, surface transport,national and local planning - and covered in addition economics,agriculture, and the military requirement for the Shoeburyness firingrange.     The review has now been completed and its findings are setout in this White Paper.
V - Alternatives to StanstedAir traffic control implications \42.   Before going on to discuss the alternative sites it would be aswell to draw attention once more to the implications that air traffic control problems hold for the siting of a third London Airport.   Asthe Interdepartmental Committee earlier pointed out in their Report,the siting of an airport that will eventually be at least the size ofHeathrow presents air traffic control problems of such complexity thatthe choice of areas around London is severely limited.   An account ofthe principal difficulties is given in Appendix 4.   The working outof the various factors described in this Appendix, in combination with the route requirements of the London area, points to a third london airport site somewhere in the sector between the Heathrow -Birmingham and the Heathrow - Margate axes; and in order to avoidreducing the capacity of Heathrow it should be sited outside a line which runs broadly through Brackley - Northampton - Bedford - BishopfsStortford - Chelmsford - Chatham - Folkestone.43.   The effects of the third London airport on military flying havealso to be considered; these will depend on the extent to which the traffic patterns associated with any particular site impose restrictionson the use of hitherto uncontrolled airspace to the northeast ornorthwest of London.Alternatives to Stansted put forward at the Public Inquiry44.   The sites mentioned at the Public Inquiry, apart from Stansted, wereCastle Donington (about 8 miles South East of Derby)Ferrybridge (near Pontefract, Yorkshire)Gunfleet Sands (in the North Sea, 5 miles off Clacton)Dengie Flats (Essex coast)Foulness (Essex coast, near Southend)Isle of Sheppey (Kent)Cliffe Marshes (Thames Estuary, Kent)Plumstead Marshes (South East London)Padworth (about 8 miles South West of Reading)The relation of these sites to London can be seen on the map at Appendix5.Castle Donington and Ferrybridge45.   These two proposals were not put forward during the Inquiry asserious possibilities for a third &quot;London&quot; airport but to develop the argument that the need for the third London airport should be avoidedby building up the air services serving the main provincial cities.As Section II explains, however, this is not possible because even withthe growth of regional air services - and they will grow - London&apos;s owntraffic will have outgrown the existing London airports by the mid-1970&apos;s
It is clear, as the Inspector recognised (paragraphs 28 and77 of his report),  that both Castle Donington and Ferrybridge are much too far from London to serve as &quot;London&quot; airports and,  therefore,  theymust be rejected..Gunfleet Sands46.     The Government agrees with the Inspector&apos;s technical assessor thatit would be impracticable to site a third London airport at Gunfleet Sands.The site is five miles out to sea;    construction would be very costly and present enormous and possibly insuperable problems.    The shore in thevicinity is also more than 60 miles from central London and access acrossthe inshore shipping channel would be difficult.DOngie Flats, Foulness, Sheppey and Cliffe - (These sites can be groupedtogether conveniently as the &quot;Thames Estuary&quot; sites.)47.     The fact that the proposed sites at Foulness, Sheppey and Cliffeare situated on low lying, marshy ground near the Thames Estuary means,on the one hand, that the land is of less value for agriculture or other alternative purposes, but on the other, that the construction of an airport would be more difficult and more expensive (to the extent probablyof at least  15m.) than on a dry inland site.   Much of the proposed site at Dengie Flats is in the sea, and the same problems of cost and difficultyof construction would arise as at Gunfleet Sands.    Use of Dengie Flats,Foulness, Cliffe, and Sheppey would entail the removal of the firing rangeat Shoeburyness.    (The question of the range is discussed in more detail in para.53 below).   The selection of Foulness would also mean the completeclosure of Southend Airport while the selection of the other three would very severely restrict its use by passenger services.   The site at Cliffeis too restricted to accommodate an airport of more than two parallelrunways of the separation necessary to achieve maximum capacity.    Cliffeis also too far west to be able to function completely independently ofHeathrow from the air traffic control point of view with the effect thatthe combined capacity of the two airports would be less than theirpotential separate capacities.48.     The Government are satisfied that, of these Thames Estuary sites,Sheppey is the. most promising. It would not cause any significantinterference with military flying.    Enough flat land would be availablefor the construction of three or four well-spaced parallel runways (thoughthe marshy and low-lying nature of the ground would make the workconsiderably more expensive than at Stansted).    The noise problem would &apos;be relatively small.   The agricultural land on the island is not of high quality (though if - as might well be necessary - new housing and other services associated with the airport had to spill over to the North Kentmainland, where the quality of the land is exceptionally high, the cost .to agriculture would be more serious).   Again, the loss of rural amenitymight not be so grave as with some other sites.    Finally, there seem tobe no serious objections to a modest expansion of population in the area.
49.     There are, nevertheless, serious drawbacks.   The journey by road to Sheppey from central London in the mid-1970&apos;s would take, on anecessarily tentative estimate, about 100 minutes even in off-peakperiods;    and a fairly long link road would be required between the M.2and the airport.    It would also be difficult to provide rail access from central London:    it would only be possible to provide a journey timeof 70-75 minutes,  and that only at great cost.   Moreover, Sheppey&apos;sgeographical position makes it relatively difficult of access from all parts of the country but S.E. London and Kent.   An airport at Sheppeywould also, as mentioned in para. 47, have the disadvantage of severelyrestricting the use of Southend Airport by regular passenger services,most of which would have to be accommodated elsewhere (in terms of air transport landings and take-offs Southend is the country&apos;s third busiestairport), and it would lead to the closure and reprovision elsewhere ofthe Ministry of Defence firing range at Shoeburyness.   The cumulative effect of these difficulties would be to make Sheppey a very expensivesite indeed to develop as the third London airport, as the followingtable shows:Approximate cost of developing internationalairport with two parallel runways at Sheppey M.Ultimate cost of basic airport facilities (land,terminal buildings, runways, taxiways, aprons, etc.) say,        45Additional construction costs arising from marshyand low-lying nature of site: 15Provision of access by -road: 2rail: 40Re-location of Ministry of Defence facilities at Shoeburyness: 25Cost of interference with Southend Airport:    say, 5Total       132m.Note: These do not purport to be precise estimates;    in particular,the first item - the basic cost of building a new airport - issimply a rough indication of the order of cost for purposes ofbroad comparison.50.     The Government have consequently decided that for as long as itis possible to envisage better alternatives Sheppey*s grave defects inaccessibility and high costs must rule it out as a site for a third london airport.Plumstead Marshes51.     Plumstead Marshes suffers from the same drawbacks as Cliffe, but toa much greater degree.    It is also in the Governments view, as in thatof the Inspector, too near London.    It is very close to densely populated areas and a major airport there would encounter an acute noise problem from the very beginning.
Padworth52.   This site received a good deal of attention at the Inquiry.     its position in relation to Heathrov/ however is such that on more than 40per cent of occasions (governed by strength and direction of winds)operations on parallel runways would to an -unacceptable extent come close to or overlap with those of Heathrow.     In addition, a civil airport atPadworth v/ould have a serious effect upon military flying in centralsouthern England, and v/ould necessitate the reprovision of a wide range of facilities at a very large cost.     The choice of Padworth wouldalso mean the closure and replacement of the Atomic Weapons research establishment at Aldermaston and the cessation of flying operations atthe Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough.     The noise problemv/ould be likely to be worse than st Stansted.     For all these reasons,the Government concludes that Padworth must be ruled out as a site for a third London airport.Shoeburyness firing range53.     In carrying out this review of the alternatives to Stansteddiscussed in the Inspectors report the Government has not approached the problem of the Shoeburyness firing range v/ith a closed mind.     However,the facts are these:    the Ministry of Defence will require the facilities at the range for as long as they can foresee;    it is far from certainthat the peculiarly suitable conditions at Shoeburyness for the work carried out at the range would be repeated anywhere else in the UnitedKingdom;    lastly, if it were to prove possible to reprovide thefacilities elsewhere/here this v/ould cost approximately  25m.     Since, then,there is no likelihood of the removal of the range making available anythird London airport site more attractive than Stansted, the government does not for the present propose to pursue further the practicability ofresiting the range.Alternatives to Stansted not discussed at the Inquiry54.   The Government has also re-examined the area to the northwest ofLondon, tov/ards Birmingham, because of its particular attractiveness froma regional planning aspect.     Two representative sites were examinedalthough they had not been put forward for discussion at the Public Inquiry.These were Bedford (Thurleigh), a Ministry of Technology airfield, 8 miles north of Bedford, and a hypothetical site midv/ay between London and birmingham in the area of Silverstone, about 13 miles south-west ofNorthampton.     Bedford is at present required by the Government forpurposes of aeronautical research, but this did not seem an adequatereason for ruling it out of consideration;    and &quot;Silverstone&quot; (as theother site will be called) was chosen as an illustrative example of a siteon the London - Birmingham axis.     It must be emphasised, however, thatin the absence of a full study there is no certainty that a suitable sitefor a large airport can be found in the area.
55,     The principal advantage of &quot;Silverstone&quot; is on grounds of regional planning:    it would fit in with the general sweep of planning for the region if a site could be found near enough to the plannedexpansions in the North Buckinghamshire and Northampton area for theemployment generated by the airport to be geared to these expansions.A site here could have good surface communication northwards andwestwards both by road and by rail.    It is likely to be rather betterthan Stansted from the point of view of noise.    It would also be betterin the loss of agricultural land it would entail.56.     The most serious disadvantage of &quot;Silverstone&quot; is the effect itwould have on military flying.    By necessitating a wide extension of controlled airspace over Oxfordshire and East Anglia, it would rendereight important R.A.F. and U.S.A.F. airfields effectively unusable formilitary flying and vrould place restrictions of varying severity onthirteen others.    One of the eight is at present held in reserve, butthe rest are well-equipped airfields with a long-term future.   As the performance of modern military aircraft improves, and as the concentration of forces in this country grows as a result of withdrawal from overseas theatres, the problem of finding suitable bases becomesincreasingly acute.   The eight mentioned are all good airfields on whichsubstantial money has already been spent, and it would be virtually impossible to find suitable replacements for them.    On the hypothesis,however, that suitable alternatives could be found and the consequentdisruption to military plans accepted, the cost of replacement vrouldbe very substantial and might reach  lOOm.57.     &quot;Silverstone&quot; also has other drawbacks.   Access from London wouldnot be as good as for Stansted:    the road journey, via the M.l. and aspecial link road, would on a tentative estimate take about 100 minutes,,even in off-peak periods:    a site here could perhaps be brought within75 minutes rail journey of Victoria or 60 minutes of Euston by a spurfrom the site to the London Midland Region&apos;S electrified main line.It vrould not be a good choice from the point of view of civil air traffic control, because it would complicate and lengthen air traffic routes between the other London airports and the north and would probablyrestrict the capacity of Birmingham Airport.58.     The Government, therefore, after giving very careful considerationto the possibility of siting the third London airport in the Silverstonedistrict, has concluded that the drawbacks of such an airport - andparticularly its very severe effect on military deployments - must ruleit out so long as alternatives exist.59.    a similarly detrimental effect on military aviation is a feature of almost any site in this part of the country, including Bedford.Moreover, Bedford, while exhibiting all the drawbacks of a site relativelydistant from London, does not offer the Silverstone districts considerableattractions from the regional planning viewpoint.   The Government hasdecided therefore that this area does not merit further consideration.
VI - The case for Stansted60.   Before a decision can be taken on Stansted, its advantages and draw-backs must be compared with those of the other possible sites.    TheGovernment&apos;s comments on the Inspector&apos;s criticisms of Stansted are largely set out in Appendix 3*Air Traffic Control61.    Stansted is satisfactory from the point of view of air traffic con-trol, as the Inspector recognised;    and the Government sees no prospectof any changes in the existing control pattern that would alterStansted&apos;s advantage on this score.    It would not seriously restrictoperations at any other existing civil aerodrome, nor would it interferewith the Shoeburyness range.    Stansted&apos;s effect on military flying wouldbe tolerable, even though its development to full planned capacity would eventually render unusable the neighbouring U.S.A.F. base at Wethersfield(which would have to be reprovided if the military requirement continues)and would place certain limitations on other military airfields.Terrain62.   The terrain at Stansted is suitable for the development of a largeairport and is free of abnormal cost factors.Noise63.   The Government does not believe that the nuisance from noise at stansted would be as bad as the Inspector&apos;s report suggest;    its reasonsfor believing this are set out at length in paragraphs 12-22 of appendix 3 to this Paper.    It is true that the noise problem at Stanstedwould be rather worse than at Sheppey, but it does not compare badlywith other inland sites in this respect;    estimates suggest that with both Heathrow and Stansted operating to the full capacity of two parallelrunways the number of people around Stansted subjected to very high noiseexposure would be only one twentieth of the number around Heathrow.Road and rail access64.   The road route to Stansted would be by the M.11 (the section inquestion is likely to be completed by the early 1970&apos;s) and the off-peakjourney time to central London would be about 20 minutes;    a short linkroad would be necessary to- connect the airport with the motorway.    By
Total         47 million//Plus the possible cost of replacingfacilities at Wethersfield.(See footnote to Table in paragraph 49).Agricultural land66.   The area around Stansted consists of land of particularly highagricultural quality and the Government agrees Vith the Inspector thatthe loss of many thousands of acres at Stansted is a substantial argument against this location for a third London airport.    Nevertheless theirexhaustive study has not revealed an alternative site in an area oflesser agricultural importance which does not suffer from otherdisadvantages even more severe than the agricultural disadvantages ofStansted.   The loss of land would be part of the high price to be paid for the benefits of the airport to the nation.Regional planning^7.    In the Government&apos;s view the strongest of the objections toStansted is on regional planning grounds.    The Inspector points out inhis report that the airport would attract a considerable increase inthe provision of a spur between the airport and the main line atBishop&apos;s Stortford and by other minor works Stansted could be brought(though admittedly by a circutious route by way of Kings Cross andBrixton) within about an hour&apos;s journey by train from Victoria5   and in thesame way it could be made accessible to Kings Cross itself in less than an hour.Cost65.   The cost of the proposal is estimated in very broad terms asfollowss-Approximate cost of developing international airportwith two parallel runways at Stansted m.Ultimate cost of basic airport facilities(land, terminal buildings, runways, taxiways,aprons,  etc.),  say 45 millionDeduct;    Value of existing runway 441Provision of access by - road 1rail 5
population which would have to be housed and serviced.    He thought thatif full value was to be obtained from the cost of creating a new majortraffic focus suitable industries would also have to be accommodated.He concluded that the whole character of a large tract of land - atpresent predominantly rural and agricultural - would be completelyaltered and that on the evidence submitted to him development of thiskind in this area would be bad regional planning.   The evidence onplanning is summarised m Appendix 4 of the Inspectors report.68.   The Inspector^ argument that a third London airport would attractmore economic activity to the South East   is beside the point in thelight of the evidence in Section II of this White Paper of the need fora third London airport.    Leaving aside this argument, then, and the argument from the loss of agricultural land, the essence of the planningcase is that the wedge of open country between the trunk roads toCambridge and Colchester ought to be preserved as a natural lung for london and that large-scale development near Stansted might merge withthe existing straggle of development up the Lea Valley to form, a limbof the continuous built-up area of London.69.   The Government agrees that it would be desirable to keep thisattractive stretch of open countryside unspoilt, but its value must beconsidered in relation to the airport needs and the availability ofother practicable sites.   A third international airport must be reasonably close to London.   At the same time it must be sited where itwill cause as little nuisance as possible to built-up areas.   All opensites near London are potentially valuable and worth preserving as greenlungs.    It has not been shown, however, that the Stansted area is somuch more valuable by its nature than any other area within range ofLondon that it must be excluded from consideration for that reasonalone.Balance of advantage70.   Stansted has indisputable advantages over the main alternative onthe scores of air traffic control, surface access, and cost;    it is acceptable on grounds of noise;    its terrain is good for airportdevelopment.    Its acknowledged drawbacks are that the development would
entail the loss of good agricultural land and disadvantages in local and regional planning.   After a careful consideration of all thepossibilities, however, the Government believes that there is no alter-native site for a third London airport that is superior to Stansted inits implications for agriculture and planning and is at the same timeboth technically suitable and capable of development at an acceptablecost. .
VII - The Governmenfs Conclusions and their ImplementationSummary and main conclusion to;71.   This White Paper,  in Section I, has traced the history of theStansted proposal since the publication of the report of the interdepartmental Committee on the Third London Airport.    In Section IIit argues that the need for a new major airport to serve London isinescapable and probably cannot be deferred beyond the early years ofthe next decade.    Section III has shown why London&apos;s new airport shouldbe able to accept all kinds of  traffic  and should be capable ofdevelopment to a large capacity.    Section IV gives the Governmenfsreaction to the Inspector *s report and explains how the Government hasimplemented the Inspector&apos;s principal recommendations, that the problem should be further reviewed.    In Section V all the alternatives toStansted as the site for the third London airport that were discussed at the Public Inquiry, together with two other alternatives, have beendiscussed.    Finally, Section VI has reviewed the case for Stansteditself and found that it still compares favourably with other possiblesites. *72.   Having, then, carefully considered the Inspector&apos;s findings andhaving completed the further review recommended by him, the Governmenthas reached the conclusion that a new major airport to serve london should be developed at Stansted.Proposals for Implementation &quot;73.   The present Stansted Airport (along with Heathrow and GatwickAirports) is already owned and managed by the British Airports Authority,and the Government will look to the Authority to develop and manage thenew airport within the same statutory framework of-the airports authority Act 1965.   Thus, the Government will, still retain an importantrole in the development.    It will, for example, continue to provide thenavigation services at Stansted, as it already does at the Authority&apos;sother airports.    It will also, under Section 3(2) of the Act, havepower to approve, or withhold approval from, the broad lines and timing of the Authority&apos;s investment programme.   Another important controlthat the Government will have over the operation of the new airport is
the power in Section 14 of the Act to direct the BAA to take measures for &quot;limiting noise and vibration or mitigating their effect&quot;.    Neverthe-less, subject to important public safeguards such as these, theGovernment will give the Authority the widest scope for imagination and enterprise in this important new development;    it has full confidence in the Authority&apos;s ability and intention to respond to this challenge.74.   The development of a major airport at Stansted is bound to meanchanges in the character of the surrounding area.   An airport and theactivities associated with it are likely to provide employment directlyfor upwards of 20,000 people and indirectly for many more in theservice trades.    A substantial influx, of population can thereforebe expected.     Careful planning will&apos;:be &quot;heededto mitigate the impact of population growth on the surrounding area andto provide tolerable living conditions for those who will need to livenear the airport.    The Government will be consulting the local planning authorities on whether the incoming population would be betteraccommodated in a new town or in expansion of existing towns.   Therewill also be consultation with the local authorities, with the british airports Authority, and with other organisations concerned on what canbe done to mitigate hardship that development of the airport may &apos;causeto the existing population of the area.75.   The Government is, of course, aware that its conclusions on thethird London airport question will be controversial and will cause deepdisappointment in some quarters.    Nevertheless, it must now be clearthat all the many and complex issues have been thoroughly scrutinisedboth within the Government and in public.   Now that it has reviewed thevarious arguments for and against the Stansted proposal, the government believes that the time has come when a decision must be taken and thatthe decision should be to go ahead with Stansted, as the best of all &apos;the alternatives.
VIII - The Next Steps76.   This final section sets out the Governmenfs proposals for obtaining, through Parliament, public endorsement of its conclusions.77.   To develop Stansted into a major airport the British airports authority will need much more land than they at present own.    They will therefore both require formal planning permission and need to purchase &apos;the additional land either by agreement or compulsorily.78.   The Government does not intend to propose any special measures fordealing with the purchase of the additional land.    If the BAA needs to resort to compulsory purchase, it will have to follow the normalprocedures already approved by Parliament.79.   The Authority will require planning permission for thedevelopment of Stansted.     In the light of the full consideration which will have been given to this proposal both at the Public inquiry and subsequently by the Government itself, the Government proposeto confer the necessary planning permission on the Authority by meansof a Special Development Order under the Town and Country planning act 1962.     This Order will shortly be laid before Parliament andthe Government intend to afford an opportunity for a debate on theOrder and on this White Paper.

APPjNMX J?(see paragraph 37)Summmary of the Insp&amp;ctjor&apos; s-a^^S^ents..(This appendix merely presents the Inspector&apos;s views and in no waycomments on them)1,    The Inspector followed two lines of -approach towards the problem.     On theone hand he outlined the main criteria that in his view a new major airportshould ideally meet and on the other he considered Stansted and the alternativesthat were put to him in the light of these criteria and of the local objections.2.   The Inspector&apos;s ideal criteria for a major airport were:-(i)   Viability from the point of view of air traffic control.(ii)   Convenient ground access for passengers and airline operators.(iii)   A situation in respect of noise which would not inhibit operations.(iv)   Conformity with regional planning and a national transport plan.(v)   Sufficient land to allow for expansion.3,   The Inspector&apos;s views on the suitability of Stansted and other sites from each of the major aspects on which evidence was given were:-(a) Air Traffic ControlStansted was the best site so far as routeing. the flow of additionalair traffic was concerned with maximum margins of safety and inconformity with existing routes and airports.     Cliffe, Sheppey andPadworth might not be unworkable,   but loss of capacity would haveto be accepted at times.     Foulness, Dengie Flats and Gunfleet Sandswould not be possible in co-existence with the Shoeburyness firingrange, and Sheppey would also be affected by it to some extent.Plumstead Marshes was too near London and Castle Donnington too faraway to be a &quot;London&quot; airport,     Stansted would interfere less withthe existing pattern of traffic from Heathrow and Gatwick than Padworthor Cliffe.     It would interfere less with Southend Airport than Cliffe,Sheppey or the flats in the Foulness area.     It might, however, benecessary to review the present pattern of air traffic control toobtain an ideal solution.(b) Ground Access - Road :j*It was difficult to assess the impact of the potential airport traffic on existing ground links to the various sites because no origin anddestination survey had so far been made of the passengers usingHeathrow and Gatwick.     The assumption throughout the Inquiry was thatall passengers not using their own means of transport to the newairport would travel via the West End of London.     With three LondonAirports operating, as many as 6,250 people could be delivered toLondon every hour - many only to go straight out again.     Thispresented a frightening traffic problem.     If the additional road traffic forecast for the new airport was superimposed on normal traffic,road access would not be reasonable, or even feasible, at any of the sites suggested, including Stansted.     Thus a new and exclusive road traffic route was required.     The estimates made by the Ministry ofTransport of travelling times from London to the several suggestedsites did not carry conviction because (a)   they did not allow forvarying volumes of traffic at different times and (b)    they did not allow for the extra traffic which would be generated by the airportitself.     The Ministry of Transport said that the traffic generatedwould saturate a dual two-lane motorway in twenty years time while an expert for the Essex County Council said that the traffic would saturatea dual three-lane motorway.1
Ground. Access - RailApart from road access both Stansted and Padworth could be given raillinks with London.     The Padworth proposal was the neater of the two.In both cases British Railways would only be prepared to undertake the work if it would pay to do so, and it seemed that it would not pay in at least the earlier years of traffic growth.     It was not sufficiently demonstrated that there was enough spare capacity atthe existing London termini for either site for the additionaltraffic.NjoiseThe amount of noise generated by an aircraft was likely to stay fairlyconstant in the foreseeable futtire and supersonic aircraft v/ouldprobably not aggrevate the problem.     Noise would affect more peopleat Stansted (where a hospital a\nd some twenty schools would have tobe closed) than at any of the alternative sites.     Padworth would,however, be little better.     Sheppey would be the best site from the noise point of view.     The approach route to Cliffe would be overwater, but take-off noise would affect the Medway towns and Thurrock,though not intolerably in either case.All the land likely to be required at Stansted was in one of thehighest agricultural land classifications for fertility.     many thousands of acres of good farmland would be lost by siting the airport and associated housing and industrial development at and near Stansted,House ValuesThe value of houses, near an airport in the lower price bracket, atleast, was as high as in a quiet country area.     However, a speedydecision v/as desirable for those wishing to sell their houses.Regional Planning (called by the Inspector &quot;town and country planning&quot;)The airport would inevitably attract a considerable increase in population and, if full value was to be obtained from the total pro-ject, industries must be accommodated.     Stansted was not the rightplace for a focus of this kind and the whole rural character of thedistrict would be altered.     A development of this nature at Stanstedwould be bad regional planning.National Planning (called &quot;regional planning&quot; by the Inspector)A third London airport of high capacity would increase the magnetismof the South East 10, all sorts of activities.     Many long journeyswould have to be made to London,merely to reach the airport, thusincreasing its traffic problems.     This should be avoided if possible.
APPENDIX 3(see paragraph 37 of the paper)The Government1s detailed comments on the Inspector&apos;sreport(reference in this Appendix are to the Inspector&apos;s report unless otherwisestated)1, The following paragraphs contain the Governmenfs main comments on the inspector &apos;s report, arranged un der the same headings as the summary of the inspector&apos;s arguments in Appendix 2.(a) Air Traffic Control2,    Although the Inspector accepted that the case for Stansted on air traffic control grounds was proved, paragraph 48(l) of the report contains the implication that the Ministry of Aviation witnesses considered Stansted (andits alternatives) solely in relation to an existing route structure.     Thisview would appear to be influenced by paragraph 13 of - the Assessor &apos;s report,which suggests that there was a tendency on the part of the Ministry of aviation to treat the existing airways and sequencing areas as virtuallyimmutable.     This is not a correct statement of the evidence presented by theMinistry of Aviation witnesses.     The local airport approach and departurepatterns, including holding areas, depicted on the maps which were presentedat the Inquiry, assumed the use of simultaneous parallel landing techniques,which are still on trial.     The structure shown for Heathrow was not thepresent one, but that which it is planned to introduce when these proceduresare brought into operation.     The overall terminal area route structureadumbrated in the same maps was built up around these necessary local patterns,and the precise routes were mostly different from those that now exist.Such similarities as there were arose because our geographical situation inrelation to Europe and the Americas means that the main traffic streams will want to proceed in the same directions as in the past.     The broad directionof a route \\rhich v/as already optimum was not changed.(b) and (c) Ground access - road and railGeneral3.     The Inspector was clearly right to be concerned about the problem of surface access to the third London airport.     The problem is, of course, but one aspect of the general problem of how to cope in the future with thegrowth of travel desires in the London area.     It would be   idle to pretend that easy solutions are in sight.     Certainly, heavy investment in roadswill continue to be needed, public transport facilities will have to be improved and extended and in some areas restraint of road traffic by one method or another may very probably be necessary.     As for the specific problem of access to airports it is clear that facilities for mass transit will have to beprovided between the airport and London by coach, surface rail or underground(or a combination of them) or, conceivably, by some less conventional formof transport,4.     Thus the Government acknowledges the problems associated with surfaceaccess to the third airport - any third airport.     But it is neverthelessconvinced that, of all the sites which appear to be possibilities, Stanstedis the one at which the difficulties would almost certainly be at their least.Amount of road traffic generated by a third London airport - Paragraph 145.     The road traffic generated by the airport will certainly pose problems.This would, of course, be so at any site.     But the total number of vehiclesentering and leaving the airport is relevant only to the consideration of thelayout and capacity of the road providing the immediate access to the airport.Moreover, the traffic estimate quoted in this paragraph is based on theassumption that the proportions of people entering or leaving the airport by1
private and by public transport would be the same as at Heathrow currently.Whether this will in fact be so depends among other things on the policiest0 be adopted by the British Airports Authority in relation to passengerprocessing, car parking space and so on.     It is possible however that, if an attractive mass transit link to the third airport were provided, a substantial proportion of travellers would use it.     Any measures of restraint of road traffic which were introduced in London might also tend to increase theproportion of people using a mass transit facility.Access to Stansted compared with access to Heathrow -Paragraphs 23(2)(b) and 48(2) &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;6,    Throughout the Inquiry there was an understandable tendency to compare thepossible sites for a third London airport with Heathrow.     In terms ofproximity and accessibility to central London, Heathrow is unique, and, short of the clearance of thousands of acres of surburbia to make way for a newairport, must remain so.     It is against this background that the question of road access to a third London airport must be considered.     Airlines operatingat any of the possible third airport sites would be worse off than at Heathrow.This is inevitable.     But surface access to Stansted appears in fact to bebetter than to any other possible site.Estimates of journey times by road to Stansted - Paragraph 367.    The estimates of journey time cannot of course be firm, relating as they do to a time some years ahead when we cannot predict precisely what roadimprovements will have been made, what traffic policies will be in force, or what volumes of traffic there will be.     The estimates were simply the best that could be made at the time.     The Inspector &apos;s criticism that the time taken for the in-town sector could &quot;vary enormously according to the stateof the traffic&quot; must again apply equally to traffic by road to central london from any &quot;third airport&quot; site.     The volume of traffic generated by the airportitself would be relatively less significant the further the distance from the airport, and would not be likely to affect greatly the journey time to central london.Effect of airport traffic on road congestion - Paragraphs 37 and 388,    Use of the word &quot;saturated&quot; may be misleading.     The lower and higherestimates of peak hour traffic referred to by the Inspector would correspondroughly to the &quot;design capacity&quot; of dual two-lane and dual three-lane motorwaysrespectively - the capacity at which no vehicle travelling on the road impedesany other.     &quot;Saturation&quot; implies the inability to carry additional traffic;this condition would not set in until flows substantially exceeded designcapacity.9.    As already stated in paragraph 5 above,  the total number of arrivals anddepartures is only relevant to the consideration of the road layout on the airport itself.     It is true that in the case of Stansted a high proportion ofthis traffic might be expected to use the length of M.11  immediately to thesouth of Bishop&apos;s Stortford.     But    the traffic would &quot;fan out&quot; as itapproached London.     Any airport terminal in London would be essentially acollecting point for passengers using coaches or other mass transit facilities which might be provided and not for passengers by car.     The chances are thatif the mass transit facility were good enough it would be used by the greatmajority whose origin and destination were reasonably near the terminal.Feasibility of rail link between Stansted and Victoria - Paragraphs 39-4110.   British Rail have recently confirmed that in their view a rail service couldbe provided between Stansted and Victoria with a journey time of an hour, andthat Victoria could accommodate the extra traffic.     It is not clear on whatevidence the Inspector challenged this.     Whether such a link would pay overtime would depend on many things - not least on the level of fares.     Thepresent coach service to Heathrow demonstrates that people are prepared topay well above standard prices for a specialised service.2
v^nme. of traffic passing-through a central town terminal at Victoria -paragraphs 44 and 4511.   The comments made here by the Inspector would again apply to any airportlink with a town centre terminal.    But airport traffic will form only a verysmall proportion of the total traffic in Inner London.    In anycase there isno certainty that existing air terminal policy will operate in the future.    Itis possible, for example, that passengers for central London using public transport might be delivered to several terminals, sited to suit variousneeds.(d)   NoiseGeneral12.   In his report the Inspector appears to dismiss the case for Stansted onnoise grounds.   However, the reasoning that led him to this conclusion is opento question.    In the first place it is clear that wherever a third london airport is sited it is bound to cause some noise nuisance.   The crucial question is whether Stansted is likely to produce more noise nuisance thanthe practicable alternatives, and, if so, how much more.   As the Inspector didnot form a view on how much noise nuisance from a third London airport,wherever placed, would be inescapable, there is no means of assessing fromhis report the strength of the arguments against Stansted on noise grounds.Secondly, the Inspector&apos;s presentation of the Ministry of Aviation&apos;s evidence is to some extent distorted and open to misinterpretation.   For these two principle reasons the Government believes that the Inspector&apos;s objections toStansted on noise grounds are by no means fully justified.13.   On the first point, there are two obstacles to assessing and comparing the degree of noise nuisance likely to be experienced in areas surroundingpossible sites for the third London airport.   Firstly, no one knows,precisely, how noisy aircraft will be in ten or twenty years time, or how farair traffic control procedures will have changed.   The pessimistic case is assumed here, as it was at the Inquiry;    that the aircraft operating in twenty years time will be as noisy but no more so, than long and medium haul jets inoperation today.    It is also assumed that their technical characteristics andthe air traffic control procedures in force will not make the noise of these aircraft, at similar positions in relation to the airport, less audible on theground than they are today.    Secondly, it is not easy to measure objectivelythe effect of noise on people.    The most scientific method available is thatdeveloped by the V/ilson Committee on Noise in its examination of the noisearound Heathrow.14.   On this basis estimates were submitted at the Inquiry about the population in areas around Stansted and a number of the alternative sites where futurenoise disturbance would be at a level classed by the Wilson Committee as unacceptable   or nearly so.    Comparable estimates were also made for Heathrowand, since the Inquiry, for Silverstone.    The situation considered in each case was jet aircraft operating in numbers equivalent to nearly the full capacity oftwo parallel runways.   This would not be before the late 1980s at any of the sites except Heathrow, where it would be some time after 1970.   The populationsm the areas were the present ones, since the people who will be attracted bythe employment offered by the airport and associated developments need not add to the total number of people that will be affected by a high degree of noisenuisance.   This is because the area around an airport which is subject to thisdegree of noise has the shape of an elongated oval aligned in the direction ofthe take off and landing areas.    Thus any new development associated with an airport can be so situated as to be largely free of noise.15.   At Stansted it was estimated that about 3,000 houses or 9,000 people laywithin the area that would eventually be subject to a high degree of noisenuisance.    It is simplest to present the data for the most important sites inthe form of indices related to the populations affected.3
Relative Extent of Noise Nuisance at Various SitesAll jet traffic at a standard 1busy rate of 64 movements an hour (not before the late 1980s japart from Heathrow where itwill be some time after 1970) \about 20Thus from the point of view of noise nuisance Sheppey and Silverstone are relatively better than Stansted, but Stansted is very much better thanHeathrow.16.   In paragraph 23(2)(c) the Inspector expresses the opinion that at stansted &quot;restrictions would have to be imposed which would materiallyrestrict capacity operation&quot; (it seems from paragraph 48(5) that the principalrestriction he has in mind is one on night flying).   However, he recognisesin paragraph 29 that &quot;severe nuisance from noise is unavoidable at any loca-tion which could be considered a London airport&quot;, and the same potentialrestriction therefore attends sites other than Stansted;    but at this pointin time it is difficult to quantify the relative incidence of any suchrestriction at the various sites.17.   On the second point mentioned in paragraph 12 above - the interpretation of the detailed evidence given by the Ministry of Aviation on the aircraftnoise problem - the following paragraphs offer comment on points made by the inspector.Criterion for measuring noisenuisance - Paragraph 1318.   The Inspector said that he found it difficult to relate the Noise and number Index figures to human reactions to noise (Appendix 2 para. 79);    andin paragraph 13 he prefers to give &quot;some indication of the nuisance to whichhouses, shops and other buildings will be subject&quot; by quoting from theevidence of the expert witness on noise for the then Ministry of Aviation onthe probable situation in nearby schools and hospitals as they are at presentconstructed.   However, the evidence of witnesses for two of the main objectors(Professor Richards and Mr. Fleming), as well as the evidence of the Ministrywitness, was that the position in schools, and to a lesser extent in hospitals, was rather special in that it depended on the degree of interferencewith speech rather than on more generalised feelings of annoyance.    It istherefore not possible to relate the effect of a major airport on schools andhospitals in the vicinity to its effect on houses, shops and other buildings.19.   It is noteworthy that, as the Inspector records in Appendix 2 to thereport (paragraph 78), all four expert witnesses on noise adopted the Noiseand Number Index technique of the Wilson Committee,    The Inspector also makesincidental use himself of a criterion of 45 N.N.I. in that the 7,000 houses givenin paragraph 13 of the main report as being &quot;subject to grave nuisance by noise&quot;at Stansted are the number within the 45 N.N.I. contour.Noise disturbance^to homes around Stansted - Paragraph 1320.   The statement just mentioned about the number of houses that would be&quot;subject to grave nuisance by noise&quot; at Stansted results in fact from amisinterpretation of the Ministry of Aviation:s evidence.    In Appendix 2,paragraph 85, the Inspector quotes the Ministry of Aviation witness as sayingthat 45 N.N.I. should be the &quot;datum&quot; in both rural and urban areas.   This is correct to the extent that the witness suggested that an area bounded by aline one mile outside the 45 N.N.I. contour was one where the extent of inter-terence with speech could be profitably examined.    But the Inspector isincorrect if he is attributing to the witness any statement that NNIs greaterthan 45 represent an exposure to noise that is intolerable from the point ofview of the annoyance caused;    at no time did the witness depart from theWilson Committee&apos;s criterion of 50-60 N.N.I. for this.4Stansted       ))Sheppey )Silverstone jHeathrow       )
5.     CONFIDENTIALNoise disturbance to schools around Stansted. - Paragraph 1321.   The Inspector gives some prominence to the number o  schools that wouldbe affected by noise in paragraph 13.   There was however, at the Inquiry a conflict of evidence on the levels of noise that would cause trouble in schools - a conflict which the Inspector himself recognised (see paragraph 85-86 of Appendix 2).   Furthermore, in paragraph 13 of his report the Inspectorquotes the Ministry of Aviation witness as saying that, of the schools withinthe area of the 45 N.N.I. contour and up to a mile beyond, one half would have tobe closed on noise grounds and others &quot;would have to be examined individuallyto see if remedial measures were possible&quot;.    The Ministry of Aviation&apos;s sub-mission was in fact, that the majority of schools under consideration wouldhave to close unless they were adequately soundproofed, but that the remainderwould have to be examined individually to see if remedial measures were necessary.Noise disturbance to Herts, and Essex Hospital at Bishop&apos;s Stortford -Paragraph 1322. In the same paragraph the Inspector records the view of the Ministry of aviation witness that the Herts * and Essex Hospital at Bishop&apos;s Storford wouldhave to close down if a third London airport were built at Stansted. On theother hand there is the evidence of the Senior Consultant Pathologist at theHospital, that there were long-term plans for rebuilding the entire Hospital(which at the moment consists largely of temporary buildings).(e)    Loss of agricultural land23.   Since no large-scale residential and industrial development is at present planned in the vicinity of Stansted, it must be accepted that there will be aconsiderable loss of agricultural land if the airport and its associateddevelopment are situated at Stansted, where the land is of good quality.However, there will be some loss of land wherever the development takes place,and the question is therefore whether any reasonable alternative site is availablewhich would minimise the less of agricultural acreage for ancillary development or permit   the airport and essential associated developments to be located on land of lower agricultural quality.    In fact, the government has examined allthe alternative sites in some detail, and it is evident that each of themsuffers from defects such as to outweigh   whatever purely agriculturaladvantages it may possess over Stansted.(f)    House Values24.   The Inspector accepted the evidence that the value of &quot;houses near an airport, in the lower price brackets,  in short supply&quot;, was at least as high as in a quiet country area (paragraph 19).    He goes on to say,  in paragraph 20,that people v/Fishing to sell houses near Stansted Airport   are experiencinghardship because of uncertainty about the future development of the airport,and adds that a speedy decision is important to such people.    The Governmenthas taken note of this point and has conducted its review of the problem as quickly as was consistent with thoroughness.(g)   Regional planning and local amenity25.   The Inspector&apos;s conclusions on regional planning are dealt with inparagraphs 67-69 of this White Paper.(h)    National Planning26.   The Inspector&apos;s suggestion that a new London airport might be unnecessary and undesirable in its effect on national planning has been discussed indetail in Section II of.the body of the White Paper.
(see paragraph 42)Air traffic control factors affecting the siting of a third London airport1.     The third London airport should be located in relation to theother London airports and other major civil airports, so that they canall operate to their designed capacity and a viable pattern of air routes can be created.     At the same time, the third London airport mustbe located so that the demand it makes for additional controlled airspacecauses the minimum conflict with the operational requirements of themilitary and other users of uncontrolled airspace.2.     In order that take-offs and landings at the new airport can be madeindependently of take-offs and landings at other major airports, the newairport must be separated from these by some 30 to 40 miles, depending on their relative positions.3. The airspace around the airport must be fully controlled, so that other traffic does not interfere with the free flow of aircraft takingoff and landing.4.     Outside this immediate airspace, areas have to be provided in whichaircraft can be &quot;held&quot; - that is, can fly around in a race-track patternwhenever airport congestion causes landing delays.     These areas have tobe clear of all routes and are some 20 miles across.     For a major air-port several holding areas have to be provided.5.     Extending from the vicinity of the airport, routes have to beprovided joining the runways to the main air routes.     These link routesmust be one-way, because separate routes are required for arriving anddeparting aircraft;    they have to be provided for both directions of useof a runway;    and have to be planned so that changes in direction canreadily be made.     A sufficient number of routes has to be provided to accommodate the planned flow, with a lateral separation between any tworoutes of some seven miles.6.     The inbound and outbound routes from a number of airports to the many destinations they serve must inevitably cross;    and the crossingmust, so far as is possible, be engineered so that aircraft will naturally be at&apos; different heights.     Where this is not possible,crossings must be so located that control can effectively be exercised.7.     The need to provide routes for through traffic and for traffic forthe less important airports which are situated close to the main air-ports also complicates the problem.8.     The amount of controlled airspace devoted to any single airport hasto be limited in view of the needs of other users, including military aircraft.     The military ATC requirement varies considerably accordingto the type of aircraft and their operational role.     Common to allOperational Commands is the.need to be able to move many aircraft in avery short time and at short notice.     Training aircraft presentadditional problems since once away from airfields they are not ingeneral susceptible to close control.9.     In common with civil airfields, all important military airfieldsrequire airspace in which approaches and departures can be made withoutconflict from traffic using other airfields or following air routes.The precise areas required vary with the role.     Transport aircraft requirements are similar to those of airline aircraft;   while fighters,with their very high rates of climb, require freedom of movement to much greater heights close to airfields.
10.   There are, in fact, about one hundred active military airfields in the United Kingdom.     On any given weekday the ratio of military aircraft to civil aircraft airborne over the United Kingdom is about:1.     Thus, whatever the site chosen for the new airport outside thesouth-east corner of England (where military activity has beengradually moved out as a result of the growth of civil air traffic)there is almost bound to be some impact on the pattern of military flying and the deployment of squadrons.     The further north and west of London is the site chosen, the greater the degree of interferencewith military flying.
