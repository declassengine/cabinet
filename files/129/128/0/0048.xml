SO9IMPLICATIONS OF ENTRY INTO EUROPE FOR mobility of LABOUR AND IMMIGRATION policy note bythe Chairman of the Official Committee on Approach to europe the attached report, based on a study by a Ministry of Labourstudy group on mobility of labour and social policy, explains the provisionsof the Treaty of Rome dealing with the free employment of workers withinthe European Economic Community (e.c.) and examines their possibleimplications for the United Kingdom, especially for employment and immigration policy.2.       The report states that it is not yet known whether the next Regulationto be implemented under the Treaty, in the summer or winter of 1967, will complete the transition to free movement of labour, or whether it willprovide for a final stage of the transitional period in which labour permitswill still be required.     The draft Regulation at present being prepared bythe Commission does not provide for the abolition of any requirement thatworkers of other Community states should have a permit (in Belgium thispermit is already given automatically on sole proof of nationality;  inother countries the permit is given automatically if the immigrant hasa job to go to), but the proposed new Regulation is only at a verypreliminary stage.3,       Nor is it clear whether ultimately e.c. citizens will merelybe free to take up firm offers of jobs in member states, or whetherthey would have a right to obtain admission to any member country,including the United Kingdom, in search of work, provided that theycan show that suitable vacancies exist.     This point and the one inparagraph 2 above v/ill need further clarification.4.       It should be borne in mind that right of free movement within theCommunity is based on nationality, not on residence or previousemployment, and applies only to nationals of the European territories of the Community,     Thus, Algerian citizens, or citizens of associatedstates, resident in or employed in one Community country do not andwill not have the right to move freely to other Community countries.Even workers from French overseas Departments (such as Reunionand Martinique) do not qualify.     The only exception, in the case ofassociated states, is Greece, where the Treaty of Association providesfor free movement by the end of a transitional period (i0 e. not earlier than 1973).
5.       This means that we should not be required to allow entry tocitizens of non-European territories or associated states, even after they had been admitted to another Community country a.nd had workedthere for a period.     This means, in turn, mat we could continue to give priority to citizens of Commonwealth countries, if we so wished overcitizens of any of the Community1 s non-European territories or associates.It also means that citizens of Commonwealth countries would not, purelyby virtue of their having been employed or resident in the United Kingdom,be entitled to move freely thereafter to other Community countries.     Forthe position regarding the preference of Commonwealth citizens overCommunity nationals see paragraph 19.6.       A further point which the report brings out is that, at the moment,there is no surplus labour in the Community.    Available Italian manpoweris substantially less than the unfilled vacancies in other community countries.    In general it may be expected that such factors as languageand climate would militate against any large influx of Italian labour intothis country.     In this connection it should be remembered that one of thegreatest obstacles to growth is the shortage of labour - of the right kind and in the right places - and that on purely economic grounds an influx oflabour is to be v/elcorned.7.       The member countries themselves have shown a pragmatic approach to the obligations of the Treaty relating to the free movement of labour andhave paid special attention to the problem of achieving a balance betweensupply and demand in the Community labour market.     They can be expectedto recognise problems which the United Kingdom may experience in this field, particularly in the event of economic recession.8,       The report concludes that -(i)   The requirements by the Treaty of Rome on mobility of labour would not be likely to lead to any substantial additional influx of labour from the Continent to this country (paragraph 19).     The availability ofsupplementary benefit without any conditions of nationality or residence(which has no parallel in the e.c. countries) is unlikely to have anysubstantial effect (paragraph 20(a)).(ii)   Trade unions may be expected to see difficulties about abandoning the present arrangements for controlling the admission of foreign workers,and especially the ending of the system of consultation with the unionsbefore permits for certain types of work are granted.    This concernmay be greater&quot; at local than at national level.    There&quot; could also be difficulties if unions were faced with threatened or actual unemploymentas a result of competition from e.c. workers;  the Trades Union Congresshas expressed concern about the problem of the unemployed immigrantworker (paragraphs 20(b) and 21).     To meet these anxieties we should wish to maintain for a transitional period, as other members of theCommunity did in joining, some safeguard to provide priority for national workers in particular areas or occupations and to retain some discretion on the timing of our giving it up.
(iii) In the United Kingdom we discriminate very little against business-men and professional workers on grounds of nationality and we do notthink that acceptance of the Treaty provisions on establishment and services is likely to have much effect on the mobility of these classesof people.     The more difficult aims of this part of the Treaty, likemutual recognition of professional qualifications, are not likely to be implemented for some years (paragraphs 29-33).(iv) Entry to the e.c. might lead to pressure for the adoption of asystem of immigration control more on Continental lines, with the emphasis on internal controls rather than at the point of entry;  andin any event in time it might prove impracticable to maintain our presentmethods (paragraph 18).(v)  The principal difficulty about accepting the provisions of theTreaty of Rome on mobility of labour lies in its implications forimmigration from the Commonwealth.     Our Commonwealth policyis to control immigration from both the Old and New Commonwealthbecause we wish, for sound reasons, to limit the numbers enteringfrom the New Commonwealth and do not wish to be seen to discriminatein favour of the Old Commonwealth.    If this Commonwealth policy remains unchanged, the provisions of the Treaty of Rome will result in preferencebeing given to e.c. citizens over immigrants from the Old as well as theNew Commonwealth.     This will give rise to pressure to alter our commonwealth policy,  e. g. by returning  to unrestricted commonwealth immigration or by discriminating between immigrants from.the Old andNew Commonwealth.(Signed)   W.A.

NOTE ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF ENTRY INTO EUROPE FORMOBILITY OF LABOUR. MI&amp;RATION AND employment the Treaty of Rome1.    Article 3(c) of the Treaty of Rome sets out as one of the Treaty&apos;saims the abolition of obstacles to the free movement of persons, servicesand capital within the European Economic Community (E0EoC0).   The provisions dealing with the free movement of workers are contained in Articles 48-51of the Treaty.2.     Article 48 provides for the free movement of labour to be secured by the end of the transitional period i.e. not later than 1970.   Subject tolimitations justified by reasons of public order, public safety and publichealth, workers will have the right to accept offers of employment actuallymade and will have freedom of movement and residence for this purpose, anda conditional right to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that territory.   All discrimination based onnationality affecting employment, remuneration and other working conditions is in consequence to be abolished.   The Article does not apply to employmentin public administration.3.     Article 49 empowers the Council of E.E0C. to lay down regulations which will progressively give effect to the intentions of Article 48 by 1970.These regulations are to cover such matters as (a) collaboration betweennational employment services, (b) the establishment of appropriate machineryfor matching offers of and requests for employment and for balancing labour supply and demand in conditions which will avoid serious threats to thestandard of living and employment in the various regions and industries and(c) breaking down obstacles to the freeing of the movement of workers orany which involve discrimination by nationality in the choice of employment.-1-.   CONFIDENTIAL
4.     Article 50 is concerned with the exchange of young workers andJirticle 51 with social service benefits.Progress made by E.E0Co - Regulation 38/645. The Regulation currently in force and made under Article 49 of theTreaty is Regulation 38/64. It superseded Regulations 15 and 18 on 1st May,1964 and is due to last until 31st December, 1967.6.     After that date the present Regulation is due to be replaced by afurther Regulation, which is now being prepared.   It is not known whetherthe new Regulation will represent the final implementation of Article 48of the Treaty or whether it will be the final stago 0f the transitional period under which labour permits will still be required.7.     The present Regulation 38/64 applies to seasonal and frontierworkers, as well as to those who move permanently.   It includes thefollowing provisions:(a) the priority of the national labour market Is abolished:   E.E.C.nationals may take up employment on equal terms with &quot;home&quot;nationals in any member state, though permits are still required.(b) Member states may, however, give priority, for a period of two weeks only, to &quot;home&quot; nationals in any occupation or region wherethere is a considerable labour surplus, except that under Article of the Regulation this does not apply to foreign workers who havebeen employed for a minimum of one year.(c) The rights of workers from other member states are defined.They include:-(i)     equal treatment with &quot;home&quot;nationals as regards theirapplications for vacancies;(ii)     the right to the same conditions of employment, pay and termsof dismissal as &quot;home&quot; nationals;(iii)     the right to housing on the same terms as &quot;home&quot; nationals,(iv)     the right to bring in dependants, including his or her spousechildren up to the age of 21 and dependent relatives in theascending or descending line and also those of his or herspouse.-2-
Moreover member states must encourage workers to bring in alldependants who live with them, subject to the worker&apos;s ability to provide suitable housing for them,(v)     after a period of employment of 2 years in a member state theright to a permanent labour permit enabling the worker to take up any employment on the same conditions as &quot;home&quot; nationals,(vi)     the right to benefit from instruction in vocational training schools and rehabilitation centres.(d) Employment Exchanges must give equal treatment to their own nationals and those of other member states.(e) Legislation discriminating against the employment of foreign workersmust not apply to E.E.C. nationals.(f) Obligations of member states arising out of special relationshipsthey may have with non-European territories are not affected by the regulation.   (Article 53 (3)).   On the other hand, workers from such territories do not benefit from the Regulation in the territory of other member states.8.     The Regulations also provide for co-operation between Member Statesand the Commission in the operation of a vacancy clearance service.   it provides for an annual report on the position of the labour market and that member States should take account of this in giving priority to E.E.C.Nationals.9.     The Regulations provide for a tripartite Consultative Committeeand a Technical Committee of officials from Member States to advise theCommission.Experience in implementing Regulation 38/64 in E.E.C. countries10.     Under the terms of the Regulation, an annual report has to be issued.The report dated February, 1966 contained statistics relating to the firstnine months of 1965 together with some estimates for the whole year and agraphical comparison with previous years.   The statistics showed that between january and September, 1965, E.E.C. countries issued 688,000 permits to foreigners taking up first jobs in their countries. Of these, 220,000 went to E0E.C0 nationals, the majority (198,000) to Italians, mostly for work in-3-
flest Germany and France.   The remaining 468,000 permits were issued to nationals of countries outside E.E.C, mainly to Spaniards, Greeks, Portugueseand Turks.   Many of the permits issued to Spaniards were for seasonal workin Prance.11.     The estimates show that the total number of permits issued has been increasing yearly since 1959.   In 1959, about 220,000 permits were issued,some 140,000 (63%) of them to E.E.C. nationals.   In 1965, about 950,000permits were issued, some 300,000 (31%) to E.E.C. nationals.   In both casesthe majority of permits issued to EoEoC0 nationals went to Italians.   Thus,within E.E.C., the picture is of a drift from Italy to the Worth and West,but it is noteworthy that, despite the priority given to the E.ECC. labour market, member countries are making increasing use of workers from outsideE.E.C, to meet their labour shortages.   However, the total number of permitsissued in the first 6 months of 1966 was about 339,000 compared with391,000 in the same period in I965, i.e. a decrease of 52,000 or about13$.   The figures for E.E.C. nationals alone for the same periods were about 129,000 and 151,000 respectively, showing a decrease of 22,000 or about 15%.   Although community demand for labour fell, in August 1966there were about 725,000 unfilled vacancies of which some 530,000 were inGermany.   Italian manpower available was estimated at 160,000.Present conditions for the issue of permits to aliens for employment in U.K.12.   Foreign workers are controlled under Article 4(i)(b) of the Aliens Order,1953.   This provides that a foreigner who wishes to enter the U.K. to take up employment must produce to the Immigration Officer a permit issued by theMinistry of Labour or the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance inNorthern Ireland.   No formal rules are laid down for the issue of permitsand each application is treated on Its meirits.   The issue of permits is subject to the foreigner not being under 18 years of age and to threegeneral conditions:-(a) the proposed employment of a foreigner is reasonable and necessaryin the circumstances;(b) the employer has made adequate efforts to find suitable labour from among British subjects, citizens of the Irish Republic and-4-
foreigners who are regarded as permanent U.K. residents;(c)   the wages and other conditions offered are not less favourable thanthose commonly accorded to British employees for similar work inthe same trade and district,permit holders may not change their job without permission and their permitsare valid for a maximum of one year in the first instance, although they canbe extended.   After 4 years in approved employment, the worker may be grantedleave to settle permanently free from restrictions.^3,   During the past three years, 1964-66 an average of 24,800 permits ayear (representing 39% of the total of all permits issued to foreigners) havebeen issued to E.E.C. nationals for work in Great Britain.   Of these, anaverage of 9*650 went to Italians, and this figure is rising.Aliens&apos; Immigration Control14.   Our present system of immigration control is based on a full examinationat the port of arrival of all aliens who, under the Aliens Order, 1953frequire leave to land from an immigration officer.   The Order provides forthe refusal of leave to land and removal without appeal of any alien who hasinsufficient means, who is coming to take specific employment without priorpermission from the Ministry of Labour, who has been convicted of anextradition crime abroad or who is undesirable on mental or medical grounds.In addition, current policy allows for the refusal of leave to land on other grounds, e.g. the intention to take up unauthorised permanent residence erto look for work.The consequences of entry into E.E.C. on immigration control15.   Entry into the E0E0C. and consequent compliance with the requirementsof the Treaty of Rome would mean that the provisions of the Aliens Order andour accepted policy on the admission of aliens outlined above could not beapplied to nationals of the E0E.Co countries who would be subject toRegulation 38/64 and its successor, and to Council directives No. 221 and240.   Directive No. 221 regulates the circumstances in which E.E.C. nationalsmay be refused admission on grounds of public policy or law and order,public safety and health, and makes provisions relating to appeals againstrefusal before removal.   Directive No. 240 provides for the abolition of
restric-kiona on -fch** movement ax*&amp; x^aideaoe within. K*EUG.* of woadeers whooonie within the terms of Regulation 38 and of their families.16.     It is considered that the obligations which would devolve on thiscountry to admit E.E0C0 workers in accordance with Regulation 38 and theseDirectives could be provided for by administrative action under the AliensOrder.   A particular problem arises, however, in.relation to NorthernIreland where, by the Safeguarding of Employment Act (Northern Ireland) 1947,the employment of persons who are not Northern Ireland workers is prohibitedwithout an employment permit except in certain cases;    this will have to befurther considered in consultation with the Northern Ireland authorities.17.     But it will be necessary to consider how far it would bo practicable to maintain our system of immigration control in its present form.Provisional admission to this country pending appeal against refusal of entryis basically inconsistent with our present control arrangements, but thisquestion is at present being examined by the Committee on immigration appeals, which is due to report within the next few months.   Any appealssystem that might be established following this report would almost certainly suffice to meet E.E0C. requirements.18.     The provisions of the Treaty of Rome reflect the present controlarrangements in the member States, with the emphasis on an internal systemof control rather than a control on immigration.   Entry into E.E.C. might lead to pressure for us to alter our arrangements, to come more into line.It is not possible at this stage to be more specific about this aspect.-6-
Economic and political aspects of the migration problems arising from joining EEC19,    Abolition of the priority of the national labour market removes the safeguards afforded, to British workers by our present rules governing theissue of permits.   The effect of this on the possible movement of workers mustbe conjectural.   Unskilled labour has not generally been accepted herehitherto except for hotel seasonal work and for certain less attractive jobsand uncontrolled movements of surplus manpower from abroad could be embarrassing;but on the whole in present circumstances it does not seem likely that anyinflux would reach unmanageable proportions.   It seems likely however that itwill be possible to negotiate temporary safeguards for the protection of thenational labour market in particular occupations and regions.   As was pointedout in paragraph 11, e.c. experience is that the number of workers coming intothe Community from outside has increased more rapidly over recent years thanthe number of migrants from within e.c..  Prom the estimates referred to at paragraph 10 above, relating to 19&amp;5, it would appear that while we issuedfewer   permits        to e.c. nationals than West Germany and France, the numberof permits issued even by these two countries fell short of the numbers issuedby us if permits issued to Italians are excluded.   This would tend to confirm the impression that entry into e.c. would not give rise to any special problems in terms of the volume of migration for employment from the rest of the e.c..20,    Political and other factors may present more serious difficulties.Points which need to be considered are:-(-a)   Whether the full implementation of the Treaty of Rome will confer onEEC nationals the freedom to look for work in the territory of other member states.   Yvhen we were previously contemplating entering e.c. in19623 representatives of the Commission took the view that there wouldbe no question of this.   They envisaged that the vacancy clearing machinery would be retained and that in practice most workers who went to another member state to take up employment vrould do so through this machinery.-7-
On the other hand they did not contemplate that movement would takeplace exclusively through this machinery or even that workers would heobliged to have a firm offer of a particular job before being admitted to amember state.     They would have the right to be admitted if they could produce some evidence (including for instance a press advertisement) of avacant job for which they were not prima facie unsuitable.     In fact a recent report from our Labour Attache, Brussels, says that in Belgium althoughEEC citizens need a work permit they receive one automatically and do nothave to be recruited officially or have a job to go to.     If this practice is common and had to be adopted by the United Kingdom there would be some alarmin trade union and other circles.     The Commissions representatives considered in 1962 that in practice any unregulated influx of foreign workers was not likely to be a large-scale problem since, in their experience, most workers were unwilling to move to another country without the firm offer of a job.But, whereas in the six Common Market countries migrant workers cannot qualify for social security benefit or assistance until they have actually started work, those who came to the United Kingdom could qualify Immediately for supplementary benefit, even if they had never lived or worked in this country.This might possibly encourage a worker to choose the United Kingdom ratherthan any of the Six if he was leaving his own country in search of employment and was free to enter the other countries of the Community without an offer of employment.     But it is unlikely that the Community would require its members to admit migrant workers who had no offers of employment or that anysubstantial number of workers from the Six would undertake a journey to theUnited Kingdom without any prospect of finding employment here.-8-
Those who failed to keep their employment (having come here under Communityrules) and who became a charge on public funds could not, it seems, bedeported since the power to deport cannot be used for economic ends -Directive 64-221 - Article 2(2).(b)   Despite agreement with the trade unions at national level, there couldbe local difficulties if unions were faced with threatened or actualunemployment as a result of competition from e.c. workers.     Many trade unions are accustomed to consultation before permits are granted and night resentit if permits were granted automatically.     In particular, unions in theentertainment field might have objections.Anxieties expressed by the TUC21.   The implications of the Community^ Labour Policy were raised by the tuc Economic Committee at a recent meeting with the First Secretary of State,Their main concern appeared to be the effect that the presence of unemployedimmigrant workers from the Community, resident in the United Kingdom under theCommunity arrangements, might have on the employment prospects of Britishworkers, particularly in the event of a recession.     In this connection, the tuc Economic Committee raised the question of the rights of workers fromthe Community, who had lost their jobs after holding employment in thiscountry, to stay here in search of further work.     As indicated inparagraph 22 we expect to be able to make use of certain safeguards for national workers when there is a surplus of labour.     These however wouldnot necessarily apply (see paragraph 7b) to workers from e.c. countries whohad been employed in this country for a minimum of one year.     We would nevertheless expect that the provisions in the Treatyof Rome for consultation between members would enable us to arrange for
suitable measures to be taken to control the flow of labour between countriesin the event of an economic recession.     T/e know that there was some anxiety particularly in Germany at the end of 1 966 about the position of&quot;foreign&quot; workers vis-a-vis nationals but we understand that this referredto workers from non-member states e.g. Turkey, Greece and Spain.     TheEuropean Commission recently, in reaffirming the principle of equalitybetween Community nationals has also stressed the principle of priority for the Community labour market in view of the fall in the total demandfor workers from other countries in the traditional &quot;immigration&quot; countries of the Community.     It seems therefore that problems of the kind described by the TUC have arisen in the Community because of the presence oflarge numbers of workers from countries other than the Six rather than as a result of the movement of labour between, the Six.Safeguards for the national labour market22.   There are at present three types of safeguards to ensure that the equilibrium of labour supply and demand should not be upset :-(i)   During the transitional period, Member States may give priority to national workers for a period of two weeks in any occupationor region where there is a considerable labour surplus;(ii)   Under Article 29 of Regulations 38-64 the Commission producesan annual report on the position of the labour markets withinthe Community and Member States must take account of this whenmaking their estimates for the following year in order to achieve a balance between offers of, and applications for, employment;(iii)   There is a general safeguard under Article 103 of the Treaty of Romewhich provides for consultation between Member States and theCommission on measures to be taken in the light of prevailingeconomic circumstances.-10-
It would help to overcome the initial misgivings mentioned, above in tradeunion and other quarters if we were able to maintain a safeguard of the kindmentioned in (1 ) above, providing priority for national workers in particular areas or occupations for a transitional period as the other members of theCommunity did on joining.   Presumably we could not maintain such safeguardsindefinitely when they had been given up by all our e.c. partners but wewould wish to retain some discretion on the timing of our giving them up.The problems of Commonwealth immigration23.    The Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 applies to citizens of other independent Commonwealth countries, to citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies who derive their citizenship through a connection with an overseasterritory, and to citizens of the Irish Republic.   As the Republic forms acommon travel area with the United Kingdom, Irish citizens are in practicefree to come and go;   but otherwise the control under the Act, including theprovisions relating to deportation, applies equally to the citizens of all commonwealth territories and the Irish Republic,   Those who wish to come for employment are expected to obtain Ministry of Labour vouchers before coming.Voucher holders are entitled to remain here permanently and may change theirjob at will and vouchers are issued at a rate fixed from time to time by theGovernment.   This is necessary because of the social problems that would be created by the large numbers of people of Asian or African race who would otherwise come here with their families in search of work, but it has been extended as a matter of principle to citizens of Canada, Australia andNew Zealand on whom, however, there is no other need to impose an immigration control.-11-C0M FIDE NTS At
24,    When it was decided to control immigration from the Commonwealth itwas envisaged that vouchers would be issued at a rate which would enable notonly specially qualified Commonwealth citizens to enter freely but also thosevdth jobs to come to, and that there would be some vouchers available forwould-be migrants who did not come within these two categories.   On this assumption and on the assumption that the entry of an e.c. worker into amember country would be contingent on there being a job available for him,our posts in Commonwealth countries were authorised in October, 1961 to saythat it might be assumed that a scheme for control of commonwealth immigrants would be no less liberal than the provision for e.c. workersunder the Treaty of Rome.25.    The rate at which vouchers are issued has however never met the demand,and has been progressively reduced in an effort to keep the inward flow ofworkers and their dependants within bounds.   Since August, 1965, the ratehas been 7,500 a year (excluding a special issue of 1,000 a year to citizens of Malta until the end of July, 1967 - by which time the position will havebeen reviewed).   Vouchers are at present issued only to applicants with certain specified qualifications (doctors, dentists, trained nurses, qualified teachers,science graduates, etc. - Category B) and to those, whatever their qualifications, who have specific jobs to come to - Category a.   Applicationsare so numerous that new applicants without the special qualifications listedmay now have to wait for a matter of years before,, their applications are considered.26.    Commonwealth citizens are allowed to bring in a much narrower range of dependants than e.c. nationals would be able (and encouraged) to do.   children of e.c. nationals would, for example, be admitted up to the age of 21, comparedwith 16 for Commonwealth citizens&apos; children.   Grandfathers and grandsons ofEEC nationals might also qualify.   The stricter controls upon commonwealth immigration introduced in 1965 were partly due to the fact that Commonwealthdependants were arriving in substantial and increasing numbers, and the issue is still very much a live one.
p^gR-ible effects on the present voucher scheme27, How far accession to the e.c. would he affected by the interpretation ofArticle 53(3) of Regulation 38/64 about the nature of special relationships with non-European territories (see paragraph 7(f) above) is not clear.     Provision (a)for uniformity of operation for vacancy clearance within the Community;    (b) theestablishment of a priority system to clear vacancies as far as possible by a labour force of nationals of Member States and (c) the channelling of the efforts of Members States to the finding of adequate offers of, and requests for, employmentsuch as those at present contained in certain Articles of Regulation 38/64 couldaffect our present practice of issuing vouchers to Commonwealth immigrants to fillparticular jobs (Category A) if a surplus of manpower from e.c. Member Countriesexisted in respect of that kind of employment.     In practice, the issue of vouchersto Commonwealth citizens &quot;with special qualifications and skills who seek work inthe United Kingdom (Category B) would probably not be affected since the qualifications now required before a voucher can be issued are in universally short supply.Contrast between control of the Commonwealth citizen and freedom of movement forSEC citizens28, Even if accession to the European Community did not directly affect theadministration of the Commonwealth immigration control, nevertheless, the contrastbetween the strict control over Commonwealth citizens and the freedom of movement&apos;re would have to accord to nationals of other Members States of the Community (andthe wider range of dependants those nationals would be free to bring into theUnited Kingdom) would be very marked.     Although it will have to be seriouslyexamined, the middle course of lifting the control for citizens of the old commonwealth countries (to which there would be no practical objection) wouldoffend against the principle that the control should apply equally to the citizens of all overseas Commonwealth territories.     It would seem mostimportant that entry into the e.c. should not restrict our freedom to seek the best solution of these difficult problems and to modify the CommonwealthMigration control from time to time in any way which may seem desirable.-13-
Mobility Among Professional Workers and Businessmen29.   Articles 52 to 66 of the Treaty require the progressive abolitionwithin the Community of restrictions on the right of nationals of a member state   (whether physical persons or companies) to engage in non-wage-earning activities in the territory of another member state, whether ornot the activity involves setting up an establishment in the other state&quot;sterritory.30.   In 1961, the Council approved a programme to be completed by 1969for the issue of directives aiming at the removal of discrimination inalmost the whole of industry, in wholesale and retail trade, in publicworks contracts, in insurance and in certain liberal professions.    So faronly 18 of these directives have been approved and the Community havelagged far behind their time-table.31 .   At present we discriminate against foreigners as such in certain limited respects e.g. not allowing them to be employed as masters andother certificated officers of certain British ships (or to hold suchcertificates).     But in general our legislation and practice does notdiscriminate against foreigners as such.    It does not seem therefore that the relevant provisions should present insurmountable problems for theUnited Kingdom or that in general they would have a marked effect on themovement of Community personnel into the industrial and commercial fieldshere.Mutual recognition of professional qualifications32.   In the professions, the need to obtain the appropriate British (or british recognised) qualification is a practical deterrent to aliens who might wish to practise here.   Article 57 of the Treaty, however, requires the Council (in order to facilitate access to non-wage-earning activities)to issue directives for mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates andother evidence of qualifications.   The implementation of this Article,coupled with the removal of barriers to immigration from other member states, might well have an effect on mobility of personnel both ways inparticular professions and activities.   But mutual recognition of
qualifications particularly in the medical, para-medical and legal fields,and harmonisation of legislation as a corollary, may give rise to acutedifficulties in the Six (as it would no doubt in the United Kingdom) and progress in the issue of directives is likely to be slow.     It istherefore quite possible that at the time United Kingdom joined theCommunity (if she does) these difficulties   would still be unresolvedand the United Kingdom would be able to  take  part in the formulation of directives.33.   It should be noted that nothing in the Articles of the Treatyreferred to above or in measures taken under them is to invalidatenational rules prescribing special treatment for foreign nationals on grounds of public policy (ordre public), public security or public health.Nor do activities involving the exercise of government action come withinthe scope of the Articles.     The Treaty has no requirement for discrimina-tion in favour of Community nationals;    it is assumed that the UnitedKingdom would be able to offer to Commonwealth citizens or citizens ofnon e.c. countries the same treatment as would be required for Communitynationals.Conclusion34.   To sum up, it seems unlikely that United Kingdom membership of the eec would lead to a substantial additional influx of labour from theContinent to this country (paragraph 19).     The availability ofsupplementary benefit without any conditions of nationality or residence(which has no parallel in the e.c. countries) is unlikely to have anysubstantial effect0     (paragraph 20(a)).     The trade unions may seedifficulties about changing the present arrangements for control and consultation (see paragraphs 20(b) and 21 ).   .,,The provisions on mobilityamong professional workers and businessmen should not have much effect in the United Kingdom (paragraphs 29-33)o     Accession to e.c. might leadto our present form of immigration control having to be modified(paragraph 17) and would create major difficulties in relation to our control of immigrants from the Commonwealth (paragraphs 27 and 28) andpossibly from the US and from efta countries.-15-
