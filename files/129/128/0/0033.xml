This memorandum is circulated as the basis for the first partof our discussions : it is a factual summary of our talks in the capitalsof the Six. We are circulating, as an Annex to it, the detailed records of these talks. The report starts from the basis for the talks whichthe Cabinet agreed in their last full discussions on European policyin October and November (CC (66) 55th Conclusions, Minute 2).This basis was that the object of our talks was &quot; for the purpose ofestablishing whether it appears likely that essential British and commonwealth interests could be safeguarded if Britain were toaccept the Treaty of Rome and join the e.c. &quot;; and with this in view,that we should focus our discussions in the main upon the areas wherethe Cabinet foresaw the most difficulty, namely the effects of theCommon Agricultural Policy on our cost of living, on the pattern ofBritish agriculture, on Commonwealth trade and agricultural products and on our balance of payments; the other problems of commonwealth trade; the effects of Community policy on capital movements, and on regional economic policies.
3. In all our discussions in the capitals of the Community wehave stressed that it was the intention and firm determination of her majesty&apos;s Government to enter the European Economic Communityif this could be done on terms which would safeguard essential Britishand Commonwealth interests. We have said that we would beprepared to accept the Treaty of Rome, subject to the necessary adjustments consequent upon the accession of a new member and provided that we received satisfaction on the points about which we see difficulty. We have explained to the Six and sought their viewson the principal difficulties which we expected to arise, in the fields of agriculture, capital movements, regional policies, and commonwealth trade; and we have made it clear to them that therewere other questions which would need to be settled in anynegotiation but which were not of the same order of difficulty as thoseupon which we were concentrating. We made it clear that we should need further consultation with Commonwealth countries. We also stated that, although we were not speaking on behalf of our EFTApartners, we were pledged to remain in the closest consultation withthem, and it was our belief that if we applied for membershipourselves, many of them would wish to apply for membership ofor association with the Community.4. We emphasised on all our visits that we did not regard our interest in membership of the Community as making a successful outcome to the Kennedy Round any less important. We stressed thatthe deadline for the conclusion of the negotiations was coming fastupon us. We said where necessary, that we believed our own offersin the Kennedy Round to have been generous by comparison withthose of the Community, and that we hoped that the community would be able to see its way to improving its offers in order that weshould not be forced to implement our withdrawals.5. In paragraphs 6-11 below we set out briefly our generalimpressions of the attitudes of individual Community countriestowards British accession, as they emerged during the course of ourtalks. In paragraphs 12-22 we summarise what we learnt about thepossibility of dealing satisfactorily with&apos; the main difficulties we sawas hindering our entry. In paragraphs 23-34 we outline the resultsof our talks with the Community on the main points which proved to be of particular interest or concern to them.Our reception in the six capitals6. In Rome, we made a very good start, given that exploratorytalks were a new experience, the Italian Government insecure, andthe Paris visit next in line. Italian Ministers said that they were entirely favourable towards British entry to the Community, andwould do all they could to facilitate it. They said that they believedmany of the problems that had been discussed were easy to solve,others were more difficult, but none were insuperable. The Italiansthought, however, that any negotiations which we undertook wouldhave to be fairly short and should concentrate on a relatively small
number of major issues. But there was some disposition on the partof the Italian. Ministers to think that further &quot; pre-negotiations&quot;would be desirable in order to pave the way for a rapid negotiation.7. We believe that in Paris, we convinced General de gaulle and his Ministers not only that we were entirely serious in our determination to enter the Community, but also that the stock Frenchexcuses for obstructing our entry would no longer serve their purpose. There is indeed some evidence that French Ministers mayhave been somewhat disconcerted by the determination and noveltyof our approach. There has been some evidence of this in that,whilst General de Gaulle did not of course commit himself, he recognised that a considerable change had taken place in Britishthinking over the last few years, and, in his own words, that britain was now ready to &quot;moor herself alongside the Continent&quot;.Changing the ground he took up in 1963, he said that the questionof British entry raised the problem of a change in the fundamentalcharacter of the Community. He suggested, as possible alternatives to British membership, given that that seemed difficult if not impossible, either a form of association or &quot; something new anddifferent&quot;. We rejected both of these suggestions on the grounds that only membership of the Community seemed to provide asufficient basis for the wider political unity inside Europe and between Europe and the outside world which we felt must be the aim.8. In Brussels, Belgian Ministers reaffirmed their full support for British entry into the Community. Britain needed Europe and europe needed Britain. They also favoured the admission of otherEFTA countries. Their attitude was helpful throughout, thoughslightly complicated by their wish to promote ideas for european co-operation in the political and technological fields at the proposeddecennial celebrations in Rome in April 1967. We also had a usefuldiscussion with the Commission and the e.c. in which Dr. Mansholtsupported, -with figures, our claim for adjustment of the financialregulations of the Common Agricultural Policy.9. The visit to Bonn was the subject of a great deal ofdiscouraging Press comment, both before and afterwards. This aroseless from what was said in the discussions on Community membershipthan from some of the circumstances surrounding the trip and thejuxtaposition of such other issues as the Kosygin visit, the german attitude on non-proliferation and the difficulties of the offsetnegotiations. We had never expected that, given the importance which the present German Government attaches to mendingFranco-German fences, they would be prepared to exert any intensepressure on the French in favour of British membership. But theyreaffirmed that, for political and economic reasons very similar toour own (they too have over 50 million people earning a living byexports), they were in favour of Community membership for Britainand other EFTA countries, and the German Chancellor undertook that they would certainly do what they could to facilitate british entry and hoped there would be a positive outcome to our presentinitiative. There have been some suggestions since (at second-hand)
that the Germans prefer to think in terms of an extended period of pre-negotiation before Britain should apply for membership of theCommunity. Certainly, in Bonn, they suggested further bilateral discussions, but there was no suggestion that these should take any considerable length of time.10. At The Hague we found the expected enthusiasm forBritish entry. The Dutch have always been the principal supporters of British entry within the Community, and they showed that therehad been no change in their position. They recognised the difficulties that various aspects of Community policy raised for us but firmlyadvocated that in the interests of maintaining momentum and so asto give the least possible opportunity to the French for delayingdevices we should make an early application to join the community and that it should be as simple as possible. Their advice was thatthe application should be based on an acceptance of the Treaty of rome and, to the greatest extent possible, should envisage onlytransitional periods to overcome the difficulties that we foresaw.There would then, in their view, be no basis on which to reject ordelay our application: but they did not deny it was another questionif the General did make it a choice between Britain and theCommunity.11. In Luxembourg, their Ministers said that their positiveattitude towards British membership of the Community had not changed over the years since the question was first discussed. they made a number of references, on social occasions, to the role which britain had played during the war and said they believed that theCommunity could only stand to gain, both economically and politically, from Britain&apos;s entry. Their advice was very similar tothat of the Dutch, that we should go ahead with a view to earlynegotiations for membership; and they did not favour any further exploration of the position, bilateral or otherwise. They too werein favour of our making a simple application. In Luxembourg we also had the opportunity of an informal meeting with the actingPresident and members of the High Authority of the european coal and Steel Community who suggested that although there were certainly problems connected with British entry into the ECSC, none of these seemed likely to be incapable of being overcome within the framework of the Treaty of Paris, which, in their experience, had proved to be a highly flexible instrument.Main problems accession would raise for the United Kingdom12. We now turn to the individual subjects that we discussed at varying lengths in each of the capitals of the Six. First, ourhosts wished to hear us expound our problems, and what solutionswe wanted to see for them: indeed, the latter was the best way toelicit advice as to what we could hope for. In one order or another,the four main problems agriculture, capital movements,Commonwealth trade and regional policy were the standardsubjects of discussion in all capitals. We summarise below thesubstance of our reiterated statements on these subjects, bringing out
comments of particular interest to the Six as these were made in onecapital or another. Since our discussions in each capital of the six were closely and accurately reported to the other capitals both by our hosts and through our own diplomatic channels, the discussionsacquired a continuity and a sense of movement, of increasingclarification of the issues, which it is difficult to bring out in thenecessarily subject-by-subject summary which follows.Common Agricultural Policy13. In all six capitals we stressed the difficulties that would arise for the United Kingdom if we were required to accept theCommon Agricultural Policy as it stood, with no material changes,e.g., in price levels or in the financing arrangements. We describedthese difficulties under four principal headings: effects on the cost ofliving in the United Kingdom; on our farmers and on the pattern of agricultural production in the United Kingdom; on commonwealth trade; and on our balance of payments. Westressed throughout that an adequate transitional period would be needed to deal with the cost-of-living problem; that we should needboth a transitional period and some financial assistance to deal withthe disturbance to the balance of our agriculture, and that in ourview the changes in the pattern of production likely to take placemight result in an irrational use of agricultural resources in theUnited Kingdom; that there were difficult problems arising on commonwealth trade, especially those for Commonwealth sugarproducers and New Zealand; we emphasised that for New Zealanda transitional period would not be enough unless it were for ageneration, e.g., that arrangements would need to be if notpermanent, at least equal in effect to a permanent change; and westressed the importance of the balance of payments problem and theinequitable burden which would be placed on the United Kingdomif, as we calculated, we would be required to pay as under thepresent arrangements something over 35 per cent of the cost of financing the Community&apos;s agricultural policy and about twice whatany other country would have to pay.14. The French commented that the areas in which we were asking for changes were precisely those sensitive areas in which theCommunity had had such difficulty in reaching agreement. Boththey and the Dutch thought it unrealistic to expect that price levelswithin the Community would be reduced; and we knew already thatthe Germans are attached to the present level of prices. But thepoint was frequently made to us that world prices might be expectedto rise, so that the adverse consequences which we expect from joining the Community would to that extent be diminished. Therewas general agreement that the balance of payments burden falling on the United Kingdom as a result of accepting the common agricultural Policy would be inequitable. The Dutch commentedthat opinion among all six States of the Community ranged fromthe view that effects would be &quot; somewhat excessive &quot; to the viewthat they would be &quot; very excessive &quot;.
15. We found that the calculations made by Commission andGerman experts were very similar to our own, at least as regardsthe order of magnitude of the balance of payments burden whichwe should be assuming and on the probable effect on the retail costof food and thus on the cost of living. The French, however, thought we might have under-estimated the amounts we should recoup insubsidies for market support and export purposes; and fainter echoesof this were raised but not pursued in Rome and Bonn.16. The Italians asked us whether the agricultural problemscould be left until 1969, when the Community had to renegotiatethe financial regulations. We said that if mutual understanding couldbe reached as to how matters could be dealt with it might be possibleto leave certain agricultural questions for later settlement; but itwould be most imprudent, both from the point of view of the UnitedKingdom and that of the Community, to leave fundamental issuesin doubt. The Dutch were much firmer on the desirability of leavingagricultural problems until the renegotiation in 1969. They said they thought that most of our problems could be overcome byadequate transitional periods. They agreed that the effect on thecost of living could be serious if changes had to be made all atonce, but pointed out that price adjustments could take place every year under Common Market regulations and that might make theproblem easier to deal with. They asserted that from 1962-66 retailfood prices in the United Kingdom had risen by 15-1 per cent andthey thought a 3 per cent rise in the cost of living, suitably spread,should occasion no great difficulty. They pointed out also, on thebalance of payments problem, that in May 1966, the Five had agreedthat the principle of equitable sharing of burdens within theCommunity should apply and that the Germans had negotiated a ceiling on their total contribution to the Common Agricultural Policy.Although they thought that we had a fair point in arguing that theeffect upon our balance of payments would be inequitable they werefirm in reminding us that the only point agreed for application from1969 onwards was that levies should be transferred to the Communityfor Community (not only agricultural) purposes. And they thoughtthat if we were in the Community by &quot;1969 we should be able toplay a major role in determining the new financial arrangementsapplicable to agriculture.17. Luxembourg Ministers said that although they realised thedifficulties which the Common Agricultural Policy would raise forthe United Kingdom, they did not think it was possible to overturnwhat they called the &quot; basic philosophy&quot; of the policy. They did,however, suggest both that price levels would be open to negotiationonce we were in the Community, and that the Community&apos;s policyprovided for payments out of the Agricultural Fund to assist members in adapting themselves to the common policies that they would berequired to follow.18. There was little comment from Community Ministers aboutCommonwealth problems falling within the agricultural sector. we did not pursue this, since the main commodity problems, notablycereals, could not be discussed without trenching on matters now in
the final stage of negotiation in the Kennedy Round, where our interests and those of the Commonwealth are sharply opposed. Inall capitals we pointed out the importance of the Common sugar agreement and the need to overcome the problems our entry would raise; this was nowhere contested. Most of the discussion wastherefore on the most difficult question, i.e., New Zealand. Therewas general acceptance, of the view that something special needed tobe done for New Zealand, and the following comments are all subjectto that. The Belgians seemed to have some doubts whether apermanent arrangement was desirable or possible. The Germansdid not comment on our proposal that the New Zealand problemmight be dealt with, e.g., by a Morocco-type protocol, by association,or by a special quota arrangement providing for access to theCommunity for New Zealand products, beyond enquiring whether we thought that all New Zealand produce needed to be covered in thisway the implication was that they thought it would be possible todeal in one of these ways with at least some commodities. The Dutchsaid that for their part any one of the types of solution which hadbeen mentioned was acceptable to the Netherlands Government,though they seemed to prefer that we should not insist upon makinga permanent arrangement. It is our strong impression that if british entry were conceded, a reasonable settlement for New Zealand would follow so long as we insisted on it.Capital movements19. We have throughout expressed our disquiet at thepossibility that freedom of portfolio investment within theCommunity might result in British investment being channelledthrough the Community to other highly developed areas such as theUnited States, as an organised traffic. We thought that it was in theinterests neither of Britain nor the rest of the Community that much needed Community capital should be able to move overseas withoutrestriction. We said that we would wish for a transitional period todeal with direct investment, but that the problem on portfolio investment was more serious and would need a longer transitional period pending some new Community arrangements to controloutward flows of investment.20. The Italians seemed receptive to the idea that British (andother Community) capital should not move freely to highly developed countries. The French did not comment. The Belgians agreed thatportfolio investment presented a more difficult problem than direct investment, but Belgian experience had not so far assessed the riskas a particularly serious one. The Germans made no significantcomment probably because the new Government had not had timeto look into this specialised subject. The Dutch much the mostexpert on this-agreed that if a serious outflow of capital from theCommunity a new phenomenon were to appear some newCommunity arrangement would be necessary; in the meantime, they thought that if there were a significant effect on the British balanceof payments resulting from traffic of this kind, then we would beentitled to operate the safeguard clause provided in Article 70 (2) of
the Treaty. They advised us not to make it a condition of our entry to deal with this question beforehand. The Luxembourgers also recommended us to consider Article 70 (2) of the Treaty as the meansof overcoming our difficulties in this field.Regional policies21. We nowhere found any disposition to question the acceptability of the regional policies which we at present operate.The Dutch specifically declared that they would present no difficulty;the Italians have also confirmed to us that in their view there is nothing in our policies, either positive incentives or negative controlssuch as the ability to refuse industrial development certificates, whichwould be incompatible with the Treaty or subsequent policies. the belgians gave a practical example just before our visit of how laxthe Commission^ control over politically sensitive schemes is boundto be by announcing the Commission^ approval of a new schemefavouring both a needy area with one language and a less deservingarea with a different language. Our. impression is that providedschemes are non-discriminatory and do not excessively and directlydistort competition as between members of the Community, there is little to be feared.Commonwealth issues22. In addition to the Commonwealth problems, dealt with under the heading of agriculture, we said that in the last round of negotiations, those conducted by the previous Administration in1961-63, a variety of arrangements had been provisionally agreedupon or envisaged, which would have provided the offer of association for some Commonwealth countries (in particular thosein Africa and the Caribbean) and different opportunities for others(in particular comprehensive trade agreements for certain asian countries). We said that we assumed that these arrangements to theextent that they were still relevant and useful, could be carried overand the problem of African, Caribbean and Asian commonwealth countries dealt with in this fashion. We have heard nothing whichwould suggest that the Community countries would see any difficultyin maintaining arrangements of this kind: they probably feel that,sooner or later, if they do not negotiate such arrangements asconcomitants of our entry, they will have to do so on the applicationof the same Commonwealth countries motivated by reasons ofcommercial self-interest Nigeria has set a precedent which EastAfrica is following.Problems British accession raises for the Community23. A number of other questions have been discussed besides the principal ones listed above. Some of these were raised in orderto deal in advance with the known preoccupations of CommunityMinisters; some were raised specifically by them. It is in this field of community reactions to our approach that our discussions have been most informative.
The British economic position, the international role oit sterling arid the sterling balances24. This question has been a prominent feature in thediscussions. It first arose as a major issue in Paris, though we hadalready discussed it briefly in Rome. Throughout our discussions with the Community we emphasised the favourable development ofour balance of payments, our intention to maintain a strongbalance, and our belief that the sterling balances would not andshould not become a drag on the Community if we entered. In Pariswe made a long and frank expose on the position of sterling and offered to discuss constructively any anxieties they might have. Thediscussion elicited from the French the useful statement that theFrench believed the devaluation of sterling would have been of no benefit to Britain and would probably have damaged France also;otherwise MM. Pompidou and Couve de Murville were content topoint to the extent of our total debts and to sterling&apos;s world widerole as a trading and reserve currency as an example of the difficultieswhich the import of extra-European interests would bring into theCommunity.25. We made clear in all capitals that the sterling balanceswere not instruments of prestige, but bankers&apos; obligations which hadto be covered by assets, and that ours were so covered. We stoodready to discuss these obligations with other countries before entry into the Community and, if that was what they wished, to discuss with them such possibilities as funding balances against specificassets, e.g., as one aspect of the wider question of the extent to whichthe e.c. might develop a distinctive monetary policy of its own.This is of course an esoteric subject, and it was not until our Dutchfriends (who are also the most expert in these matters) for the first time responded to our statements that We were able to separate outthe two main aspects of this question.26. The Dutch, no doubt partly for their own reassurance andpartly in order that they could use this reassurance with othermembers of the Community in our favour, suggested that theCommunity should be protected from any obligation to &quot; bail usout&quot; if difficulties arose from sterling^ role as an internationalcurrency, and were not related to our own balance of payments.They clearly agreed with us that disequilibria involving any majorWestern currency should be dealt with in the framework of widerinternational monetary arrangements notably the IMF and the Baslearrangements rather than by the Community as such, whose roleunder Article 108 should be limited to assistance related to anystrains arising from the need to comply with policy requirements Ofthe Community. We confirmed that we did not regard Article 108of the Treaty of Rome as obliging the Community as such to underwrite difficulties that we might encounter in Consequence of theworld wide uses of sterling, and We would consider, if they wished,giving them a derogation to this effect. The Dutch said that thiswould cut the ground from under what the French Were saying on
the risks sterling involved for the Community. The Luxembourgersalso welcomed our statement that it would not seem appropriate to invoke Article 108 in the event of difficulties arising from the sterling balances and the wider international role of sterling. They thoughtthat it might be desirable for a document interpreting Article 108in this sense to be worked out during the course of any eventualnegotiations for British entry.27. We cannot claim that we have heard the last of this difficultyas a French objection to membership. But we are convinced that wehave gone a long way to reassure those who are prepared to bereassured on this point. The other main doubt which is held withvarying degrees of clarity in all six capitals arises from the fact thatthe strength of sterling depends on the strength of the British economy. We recited the impressive figures of recovery of our balance of payments; but some doubts clearly remain.Change in the nature of the Community28. The French placed considerable emphasis on the change which, they claimed, would take place in the nature of the Communityif the United Kingdom and other EFT A countries were admitted to membership. Clearly, what the French are worried about is that, ifwe are admitted, and if other countries come in too, then they cannot longer be in so strong a position within the Community and cannot longer expect the Community to serve as a backing for Frenchpolicy. This is not, of course, the argument the French use with us,or with the Five who relayed it to us.29. Whilst the same doubts about the results of extending theCommunity were expressed to us by all the other members of the six, with varying degrees of seriousness, their concern is very different from that of the French. It is that if the Community is expanded toinclude 10 or 12 members, it may be more difficult to develop theCommunity further. Moreover, there is a genuine fear, shared also by the Commission, that a Community expanded in this way would,unless majority voting and constructive central institutions werepreserved, be reduced to an ineffective organisation incapable ofmaking greater positive progress than for instance the present OECD.We said that it was not our wish or intention to change or to dilutethe nature of the Community any more than was inevitable upon the accession of other members. Some change there would inevitably be,but the alternative to change was stagnation, and, in any case, theTreaty itself provided for the accession of new members. Nor wasthe wider Community in fact likely to be more difficult to operate,either mathematically or politically, than the present one had proved to be. In an analogy based upon the concept of the Community&apos;shaving built a railway line towards its objective, we suggested that what we were trying to do was not only to put additional coacheson the train, but also to put a more powerful engine on it; it was no part of our plan to rip up the track or change the signals.
30. Despite the doubts expressed, all the members of theCommunity, with the exception of France, said not only that it was their firm wish to see Britain in the Community, but that they wanted to admit other members as well. Whilst there can be little doubtthat we reassured the members of the Community as to our ownintentions to help in making a success of the Community, their own experience with the intransigence of France makes the Five vulnerable to suggestions that with the Community enlarged to 10 or 12 or more the problems will be at least twice as great. The French will presumably continue to play on these fears of the Five for their ownreasons; and the Five will be looking for assurances that in an expanded Community, not only will we be concerned to play our full role in operating the institutions of the Community, but also thatthe enlarged Community itself will not be too cumbersome to functioneffectively.Institutions31. In the light of the foregoing discussions, which were somewhat delicate as we were speaking neither as members nor ascandidates for membership, we were non-committal about our attitude to majority voting within the Community (in the sense thatwe said we could accept majority voting to the same extent as theother members), and on the future role of the European Parliament-a point to which the Dutch, who believe in greater democraticParliamentary control within the Community itself, attach importance.It was a weakness of our exploratory position that we had to baseourselves on saying that we would be concerned, within an expandedCommunity, to ensure the effectiveness of the Community&apos;s operation,when it was clear that the Five are looking to us, inter alia, to makethe Community live and work again, while France is not.Technology32. One of the most impressive cards which we had available during the visits to the Community is the advanced technological development of the United Kingdom by comparison with development in Europe, the relatively large-amounts of expenditure on research and development in the United Kingdom, and the widespreadconcern in Europe about the technological gap between Europe andthe United States. We have, with, we believe, very considerable effect, made clear that greater technological collaboration can onlybe expected to take place if the economic and market base is provided in the shape of an expanded economic Community. We have saidthat we thought it necessary to achieve a strong and independentindustrial structure in Europe. This is one of the most telling ways of saying that Europe will not be big enough without us. Only inParis did there seem to be any disposition on the part of CommunityMinisters to argue that technological collaboration could be pursuedon a continuing bilateral basis, whether or not we belonged to theCommunity. We emphasised that although it was certainly truethat in the field of military co-operation the impulse and orders weregiven by Governments, in the wider field of civil technological
collaboration, projects could not be imposed by Governments; andthat it would be a mistake to assume too lightly that technologicalcollaboration with Europe could continue unimpaired if we remainedoutside the Community.ECSC, EURATOM and non-proliferation33. We have said that, if the United Kingdom joined the eec she would wish at the same time to join EURATOM and theECSC, if the separate Communities were still in existence at thetime that we came to join. If in the meantime the Communitieshad merged then, of course, we would wish to join the one, mergedCommunity. We would want to give added impetus to what mightbe regarded as the technological component of an expandedCommunity and thought that we were in a good position to do so.These assurances were in themselves well received, but a shadowwas cast over the later discussions by the reactions of Communitymembers in particular Germany and the EURATOM Commissionto the draft Non-Proliferation Treaty. We have done our best toremove anxieties arising on this score; and, as the Cabinet will know,discussions have taken place with both the Federal GermanGovernment and the EURATOM Commission on this subject outsidethe framework of our exploratory discussions concerning membership of the Community. But it would certainly be premature to say thatdoubts had been set at rest.Political unity34. In all the capitals we were asked, in one form or another,for our views on the political development of Europe. We were able to reply that for many years now we had made clear our wishto participate to the full in any discussions with that objective, thatthis was still our position. In confirmation of this, we also made itclear that we would regard it as tragic if any moves which might betaken by the Six in the near future to bring about closer politicalco-operation, e.g., at the proposed Rome Summit, should serve as a pretext for deferring consideration of the possibility of our ownmembership, and we were given assurances that this would not beallowed to happen. These replies were well received, as evidencethat our interest in the Community was not solely a calculation ofeconomic and technological advantage, but also a politicalrealisation of the necessity for a Europe strong enough and unitedenough to speak with the Super Powers on equal terms. But we made it clear that we were concerned that an enlarged community should both preserve close relations with other North AtlanticPowers and play its full role in the relaxation of East-Westtensions; that is to say, that our concept of European unity was designed both to break down the present barriers between eastern and Western Europe and to result in Europe exerting a more powerful and effective influence in world affairs. In this connection,we would draw attention to the concluding section of the openingstatement made by the Prime Minister in Paris to General de Gaulle(see page 30 of the Annex).
General impressions35. We would conclude this survey of our discussions with what are perhaps the three major impressions of a general characterit has left with us, and which are perhaps not sufficiently brought out by the foregoing account of our discussions on specific subjects.First, there can be no doubt whatsoever that, with the exception ofthe French, all members of the Community retain a strong interestin and desire for British membership. But it would be unrealistic to imagine that any of the present members could be prepared to risk the break-up, or at best the further frustration of the existingCommunity, in an effort to overbear French opposition to british membership. Some members would be prepared to exert morepressure than others on France; but certainly none would beprepared to confront the General, with all the risks that entails.36. Second, as the discussion of our major difficulties hascontinued, with a certain continuity as noted in paragraph 12 from capital to capital, the areas of real difficulty have become increasinglyclear and have been substantially reduced; the same is true of thematters which the Six said were of concern to them. It was notpossible without crossing the no-man&apos;s land between explorationand negotiation to reduce to specific terms the possibilities ofagreement on the items of major difficulty for us; but we have nodoubt that acceptable solutions to our problems could rapidly be negotiated if France did not act as saboteur.37. Third, one of our strongest impressions is of the commanding position which is waiting for us in the Community ifthe difficulties which at present stand in the way of our membership can be overcome. In our discussions we had a generally warm response to what we have said about the potentialities for good of an enlarged European Community,potentialities which are however beyond the separate capacities ofthe European countries or organisations as they exist to-day. Theexploratory character of our mission, however, naturally obligedus to respond very cautiously to the sincerity of the welcome whichso clearly awaits us if we can get in. The fact is that there is, withinmost of the Community, a clear recognition that, with the entry of britain, they will be taking into partnership a major european power, with the economic and technological capacity, the politicalwill and the kind of associates to ensure that the enlarged community will at last have the strength and the balance to playthe role in the world which the importance of Europe warrants.H.

Carlo MarchioriOpening remarksSignor Moro welcomed the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary in thename of the Italian Government. He was happy that their series of visits to thecapitals of the Six should begin in Rome. He took this as a mark of respect to theplace where the Treaty was signed and as a recognition of Italy&apos;s favourable attitude to British aspirations. Europe was not Europe without Great Britain. Italianexperience and advice would be placed fully at our disposal. Though Europe wouldbe the main theme of the discussions there might be other questions of a politicalnature which could be discussed. He would be interested to hear the PrimeMinisters explanations of the reasons which had prompted him to start on thepresent round of discussions which the Italian Government genuinely welcomed.Mr. Wilson thanked Signor Moro for his warm welcome. The purpose of themeeting was principally to discuss the possibility of British entry into theCommunity, though if time permitted other questions might also be discussed. Hewas glad that the Italian Government had agreed to make it convenient for thefirst visit to be paid to Rome. The Italian Government had always been sympathetictowards our membership of the Community. He had been very much alive tothe help constantly given to us by the Italian Government and was grateful forthe opportunity of discussing our problems with them at an early stage.He was not in Rome to begin a negotiation, but to establish whether, as we hoped, conditions might be favourable for a negotiation; he would wish to discussour problems, and to hear from Signor Moro something about Italy&apos;s experienceof dealing whilst in the Community with problems similar to our own. We were all interested to see how the Treaty of Rome was working in practice rather than to examine its theory in detail. He did not regard the Treaty of Rome in itself asan inevitable obstacle but would wish to hear something of Italian experience ofits implementation.7719
Background to the United Kingdom initiativeMr. Wilson then ran briefly over the background to the initiative, wreminded Signor Moro of his statement in the House of Commons on10th November and the purpose of the present round of visits as then explainedAfter the series of discussions with the Six was complete Her majesty&apos;sGovernment would take its decision whether or not to activate the arrangementsfor negotiating for entry and would decide, in consultation with the Six, what theappropriate time for such negotiations would be. Briefly, we took the view that britain and the Commonwealth could only be strengthened if Britain joinedEurope, and that Europe would be strengthened too. These considerations appliedboth in economic and in political terms.&apos; \AA A&quot; -  -The meetings on which he and the Foreign Secretary were engaged were inone sense, a logical extension of the discussions we had embarked upon last year.But we had now changed from low gear into top gear. Neither Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment nor, we were sure, any of our friends in the Six, wanted a repetition of the events of early 1963. Mr. Wilson reminded Signor Moro of his remarks inthe House of Commons on 10th November that we were approaching these discussions with a clear intention and determination to enter the Community if,as we hoped, our essential British and Commonwealth interests could be safeguarded; and that we meant business. Mr. Wilson said that that was exactly what he did mean. So in the talks to-day and in other capitals of the Six, whilst the form of our approach would be based on questions and analysis, its inspirationand content would be based on our determination to enter if we could find the wayto enter.He had been encouraged after his statement of 10th November not only by what Signor Fanfani had said in response but by the speed with which he had said it. We had been very happy to see his remarks, which provided confirmation thatwe could look to the Italian Government for a helpful and constructive approach to the problems.The debate which had taken place in the House of Commons on 16th and17th November was principally remarkable for the wide agreement, from all political parties, that membership of the Community was a desirable objective,and that the decision the Government had taken was the right one. The debatehad been remarkable also for its progressive tone. It was a forward-looking,not a backward-looking, debate. There was no question that the Government,in its present approach to the Six, enjoyed a very wide measure of support, bothin Parliament and the country at large. He referred to the recent study by aCommittee of the CBI, and to the results of recent public opinion polls.Another development since his announcement of the British initiative was themeeting of EFTA Heads of Government at the beginning of December. All theEFTA countries had welcomed the British move as an important step along theroad of determining the prospects for a solution of the question of economic integration in which they could all participate in an appropriate manner. Whilstwe were not, of course, empowered to speak on behalf of our EFTA partners, itwas the Prime Minister^ impression that EFTA countries all would wish toparticipate in the Community either as members or associates. This was animportant positive development by comparison with the situation of 1961-63.It had been agreed that EFTA countries would keep in the closest consultationwith each other on the development of their relations with the Community and onany discussions with the members of the Community.Treaty of RomeMr. Wilson said he thought it important to make clear again our positiontowards the Treaty of Rome. The Treaty was the centre of the matter. It wassometimes suggested that Britain was not prepared to accept the Treaty or thatwe would wish to negotiate such revisions of it as would fundamentally alter its nature as the basis of the contract between its original members. He described the British attitude in the words he used in Parliament in November. The Treatyof Rome was not in itself or necessarily an impediment; it need not be an obstacleif our problems could be dealt with satisfactorily, whether through adaptations
0f the arrangements made under the Treaty or in any other acceptable manner.In the House of Commons he had summarised this very important point by sayingthat we would be prepared to accept the Treaty of Rome subject to the necessary adjustments consequent upon the accession of a new member, and provided thatwe received satisfaction on the points of difficulty we saw. Some commentatorssuggested that our decision was based on a desire to see conditions of entry whichwould weaken the Community or lessen the ties which bound the countries ofthe Community together. But, as he would hope to say in his speech at Strasbourgnext week, our attitude was that widening the Communitv would not weaken butstrengthen it.The United Kingdom economyMr. Wilson said that the Governments present decision, unlike that takenin 1961, was not being made from a position of economic weakness but fromone of strength. We had had our balance of payments problems, in the same way as Italy. The Government had inherited from its predecessors a deficit of 800 million per annum. In 1965 this had been more than halved, and further reduced in 1966. In 1967 we would be in surplus. This situation was achieved by an improvement in our trade. In 1964 our monthly trade deficit was  45million; in 1965 this had been halved to  23 million; and in 1966 it was  12 million.The progress was quickening, to judge from the results of the latest months in1966. The Governments July measures had not yet had their full effect on exports and trade. The measures which Italy had taken had led to the possibility ofsustained expansion; we believed that our own drastic measures would do thesame for us.So our decision had been taken from a basis of strength and confidence.We, and Italy, could look forward to a surplus in the balance of payments thisyear. There were perhaps some in Europe and elsewhere who would be glad if they could look forward with the same confidence.Points of difficulty in British membership of the EECMr. Wilson then mentioned briefly what he believed to be the major points of difficulty either for us or for the Six, in British membership of the Community.Briefly, they were the problems arising from the Common Agricultural policy as it had emerged over the last few years; Commonwealth questions; problemsrelated to freedom of capital movements; and problems of regional policy. he mentioned regional policies not because he thought they constituted a majordifficulty but because we should be grateful to hear of Italian experience in this field they had problems in their south as we had in our north. The fact thathe had mentioned certain questions did not mean that there would not be others to be covered in any negotiation. Such questions might include some agriculturalproblems not directly arising out of the Common Agricultural Policy; the timetableby which we should expect to adopt the Common External Tariff and abolishinternal tariffs with an expanded Community; and so forth. He did not thinkthat these questions needed to be explored in any detail at this stage. They, andothers like them, could be dealt with satisfactorily at the appropriate stage. Theywere problems for negotiations. On the question of negotiations Mr. Wilson said it was our hope that they would not involve all the details of 1961-63. We hadembarked on a great effort and would not like to see the great issues bogged downin discussions of such questions as kangaroo meat.Mr. Wilson therefore thought that the main questions to which the discussionmight be devoted were, the Treaty of Rome; questions arising directly out of theCommon Agricultural Policy; questions arising from the Community&apos;s provisions and directives on freedom of capital movements; some principal Commonwealthissues, including New Zealand; and the effects on our regional policy of membership of the Community. He would be prepared to expand on these questions duringthe course of the discussion, and would be happy to learn what the Italians thought of the possibility of overcoming the difficulties. He would also wish to hearwhether there were any other major problems or difficulties which Signor Morothought we should discuss.
Kennedy RoundMr. Wilson then turned to the timing of the British initiative in relation tothe Kennedy Round. Our present initiative did not imply in any way any reduction of interest in the Kennedy Round. We had always believed, as hadItaly, in the vital importance of making a success of the Kennedy Roundnegotiations. We all stood to gain from a successful outcome of them; and weall stood to lose from failure. The Kennedy Round presented the best opportunitythere had been to reduce trade barriers, not only within Europe, but throughoutthe world. We ourselves had never regarded our hopes of joining the community in due course as making the Kennedy Round any less important.Mr. Wilson added that he thought the present series of discussions could be 1of the most far-reaching and historical importance for Europe. He did not 1think that the United Kingdom would be asking for anything which itwas impossible to negotiate. We should be seeking to safeguard our essential interests in the same way in which the Six countries themselves had, in the courseof the negotiations which led to the establishment of the Community. If thedifficulties could be overcome, a major new opportunity would open out for usall. We should have the potential afforded by a community of nearly 300 million people in Europe, bigger than the American community, with all that that meantas regards economic development and technological potential; and we shouldthereby have begun a major step towards enabling Europe to play an ever fullerrole in the world.TechnologyMr. Wilson said that two years ago he had discussed with the Italians, atItalian initiative, the question of technological development; and since then wehad had an opportunity of studying Signor Fanfani&apos;s initiative. In his ownGuildhall speech he had said that he would like to see a drive to create a neweffort to pool within Europe the enormous technological inventiveness of Britainand other European countries, in order to enable Europe, on a competitive basis,to become more self-reliant, neither depending on imports nor dominated from outside, but basing itself on the creation of competitive indigenous Europeanindustries. He could think of nothing that would make a greater reality of thewhole European concept; and in this field of technological co-operation no one had more to contribute than Britain.Political unityMr. Wilson said that, as regards political unity, we were ready to play our full part. In Strasbourg he would be speaking on the thought that, if the 19thcentury was an age of heroic European nationalism, the 20th century would godown to history as an age in which man had had the vision to create, out ofthese nation States, and out of the destruction caused by two world wars, a newunity, which, so far from rejecting the diversity of nation States, would be thegreater and more real because it built on that diversity; so that nationalcharacteristics would be enriched by their association in a wider outward-lookingunity.Italy&apos;s attitudeSignor Mow thanked Mr. Wilson for his frank and detailed exposition, whichhad allowed him to see the development of our thought and the prospects as wemoved towards the objective. He was impressed by the seriousness and sincerity of the British interest in joining Europe. This impression was not lessened byMr. Wilson&apos;s having said that the present meetings must have an exploratorycharacter; the Italians fully understood this.Our intentions corresponded to Italy&apos;s own attitude. They shared the Britishvision in Europe of a united Community of 300 million people with the resources,material and intellectual, which could free Europe from &quot;the danger of fallingunder external domination.He was glad also that the British Government shared the Italian attitudetowards political unity. In the Italian view there were two essentials that theCommunity should be democratic and that it should offer a genuine prospectof economic and political integration. He was glad to see the United Kingdomworking in the same direction, even though the prospect might still be furtheraway than the Italians would wish.
He was glad also to note what Mr. Wilson had said about accepting the aims and fundamental structure of the Treaty of Rome, as they had developedover the years. If his understanding was right, the United Kingdom requirementsmight be limited to the adaptations which would be necessary to enable theUnited Kingdom to make an easy transition to membership of the Community.He believed that essential British interests could be safeguarded and that it couldso be arranged that no harmful effect to the British economy would result.He agreed that the present discussions should not go into detail but should seek to establish agreement on the main issues and to show how suitable arrangements could be made to deal with them.Signor Moro said also that he was glad to hear of the favourable developmentof the economic situation in Great Britain, both for its own sake and because itwould help to ease British entry into the Community. He was also pleased to hear Mr. Wilson&apos;s reference to technology and interested in what he had said on the Kennedy Round. The Kennedy Round was important not only in theinterests of world trade but also because a successful conclusion would eliminatecertain of the difficulties which had prejudiced our entry in 1961-63. Mr. Wilsonwould appreciate that in the Kennedy Round a sympathetic attitude betweenthe United Kingdom and the Six would be a significant mark of the understanding between us.Signor Fanfani confirmed the Italian Governments favourable attitude tothe question of British entry. Four years ago, after the failure of the previous negotiations, he had discussed with the then British Government what should bedone next. The conclusion was that nothing should be done to increase the gap between the Community and the United Kingdom, in order that thenegotiations might be resumed, when the time was ripe, without difficulty. TheItalian Governments conscience was clear on this point. They had doneeverything possible to bring nearer the resumption. He noted with gratitudewhat Mr. Wilson had said about his own reaction to the announcement of theBritish initiative. Mr. Wilson had said that this initiative was in the interestsof the United Kingdom; but it was in those of the Community too. It was saidthat some of the Six were less interested in British membership than Italy; theItalians believed that, if they examined their interests properly, these othercountries should also be in favour. He was therefore comparatively optimisticabout the outcome of the present round of talks.Mr. Wilson had rightly said that Great Britain had a large fund of technologicalknowledge which could be made available within the Community. greater co-operation between the United Kingdom and the Community, and indeed withinEurope as a whole, in this field would make a very considerable contribution tothe well-being of the world. Technology was a new card by comparison with the1961-63 negotiations; it must be played as skilfully as possible. The Italians wouldbe pleased to make their advice available in order that.,we might reach our objective.Signor Fanfani said he hoped that at the end of the soundings we wouldconclude that the time had come to embark upon negotiations. Italy wouldapproach these negotiations in a positive spirit. They were glad to hear that we did not necessarily see any insuperable obstacles in the Treaty of Rome; but it was quite understandable that our attitude should be subject to certain conditionsaffecting the modifications and arrangements necessary to allow Great Britain toenter. They believed it right that we should take soundings on our own requirements and those of the Community. The Italians had some points which mr. Wilson had not mentioned. Others would come up elsewhere in the Six; buthe hoped that we would not find these insuperable and that we should be able tomove forward into negotiations on timings and modalities.After the signature of the Treaty of Rome the members of the community had set out to discover how they could reconcile their own respective requirements.It was understandable that a new country coming in after the Community had beenestablished for 10 years should try to find out about the processes which had takenplace within the Community. There had been difficulties in reconciling theeconomic problems of the Six member countries. We had mentioned the questionoi depressed areas and would therefore appreciate the problems of the ItalianGovernment when the whole of Italy had been virtually a depressed area by
comparison with the rest of the Community. Often Italy had had to exert pressure on the other members. But they had always raised the question not as one ofcharity but in order to insist on homogeneity within the Six. The problem hadbeen one of attaining a satisfactory balance between developed and less developedareas within the Community. His own recommendation to Great Britain wasthat, when faced with problems of securing the right balance of interests for the sake of homogeneity within the Community, great patience and determination were necessary. Even now, of course, not all the problems had been solved.Turning to the Common Agricultural Policy in which we saw difficulties, italy had been along the same road before us. Italy&apos;s whole position had changed, largelyduring the negotiations, from that of a net food exporter to a net food importer.Italy therefore understood very well British concern at the prospect of having topay something like  200 million to the agricultural fund.Signor Fanfani stated the problems not in order to discourage us. but although there would be thorns on the way, there would be roses at the end of the path.Signor Fanfani said that it was natural that, as a result of our entry, conditionsin the Community would change. The Six would be faced with the prospect of modifying regulations which had been drawn up with great difficulty and, on one occasion, had nearly led to the break up of the Community. It was natural,therefore, that we should seek to reach mutual understanding in the present dialoguebefore the stage of negotiations. But the fact that, knowing all the difficulties, wenevertheless were making our present attempt to join the Community and that thepresent initiative had been accepted by the Six, disposed of the argument that britain was not sincere or that the Six were not animated by goodwill.Signor Fanfani said that Mr. Wilson had dealt frankly with the British economic position. There were, of course, differences between market and structuralproblems. He was sure that the former could be satisfactorily reduced, if noteliminated; the experience of ten years within the Community showed that these could be dealt with, including monetary problems, in the spirit of Communitysolidarity. The question was more complicated with regard to structural problems;and it was necessary to decide what modifications could be adopted.The modifications which the United Kingdom required seemed to be related to four problems the common agricultural policy; the Commonwealth; capital movements; and regional policies. Such problems certainly existed and he was glad that they had been so clearly stated. Before adding to the list from theItalian side, however, he would like to say a word on the Kennedy Round. Herethere was a delicate position arising out of the British orientation in relation tothe United States. He thought that, if we proceeded carefully, especially at this juncture, it should be possible to achieve the success within the Kennedy Roundwhich would help to provide the basis for some of the modifications necessarybetween the United Kingdom and the Community. He thought it would bedesirable to go into some detail on this point, perhaps with experts, later in thediscussions.Italian questionsSignor Fanfani said that he had a number of questions which he thought heshould put in order to make the soundings useful. They were as follows:(1) As regards the British economic situation he would like to have our forecast of the length of time needed to eliminate the problems; he needed to be able tomeet this objection, if and when it was put forward as a pretext for hindering british entry. What relation in time was there likely to be between our solving our economic problems and the beginning of negotiations, or even the end of oursoundings? If our acute economic difficulties continued, and the present round of soundings proved promising, how would this affect the decision to startnegotiations?(2) What was the relation in time between the Kennedy Round and the possibleopening of negotiations?(3) What were the probable scope, extent and duration of the adaptationswhich the United Kingdom might ask for?   Would they apply only to the
Common Agricultural Policy or to other sectors as well? And as regards theCommon Agricultural Policy, would we be asking for temporary or permanentchanges? Must the question be dealt with now; or could it wait until 1969, whenagricultural questions would come up again for review within the Community?Would we require general adjustments to the regulations; or could our problemsbe dealt with by protocols; or would we ask for amendments to the Treaty itself?(4) How far could we accept the results of the negotiations in J961-63 as astarting point?(5) As regards Commonwealth interests what should be the scope of the adjustments needed?(6) What was our position on the question of adjustments in the social field,affecting such problems as social insurance? This was not an urgent problem.The Community still had two to three years before it had to be solved. But itwould become more important as the movement of workers became greater.It ought to be settled by 1st July, 1968, because there should by then, in line with the completion of the Common Market, be completely free movement oflabour within the Community.(7) There was also the question of EFTA. In the event of a successfulBritish negotiation what attitude should we expect our EFTA partners to take?Would they act individually or collectively to obtain membership? Would theEFTA countries be divided into two groups, those seeking actual membership and those, probably the neutrals, seeking only association or special arrangements?He stressed that Italy was very keen to see other EFTA countries join theCommunity in one way or another.(8) He turned then to the question of scientific and technical co-operation.He shared the British view that this was a central problem for the survival ofour economies. But there were problems of timing involved. If it should prove possible for Britain to join the Community, did we think these technologicalquestions should be deferred until the fusion of the Executives and untilEUR ATOM had been converted into a serious organ of technological research?Had we in fact considered the questions that would arise as the result of fusion?Since the issue of fusion had not been settled, it would be useful to have our views now. Two very important areas were involved, namely energy policy and scientific research. Did we envisage making our technological collaborationavailable to Europe before we had joined the e.c.? Was it our intention topromote discussion on technological co-operation in EFTA in parallel with thediscussions which would take place in the e.c.? This was a vital questionbecause it was important to get work started in NATO when the next meetingof the NATO Council took place in May or June; and there would be great advantage in e.c. and EFTA countries being able to present a combined solution.Any move towards solving these technological questions would be very helpful to the objective of United Kingdom entry into the Community.(9) Political Unity. The problem was the nature and timing of any contribution by the United Kingdom to discussions on political questions whichwould affect the vital shape of the Treaties. How could these questions be dealtwith without hindering British entry? He thought it fair to say that he did not expect the United Kingdom to be among the fanatical supporters of asupranational political union. For their part the Italian Government hoped thatthe day would come when a supranational Europe became possible. But they recognised that it should come gradually and quietly; and they certainly did not want to make Britain&apos;s negotiations for entry into the Community more difficulton this account.Answers to Italian questionsMr. Wilson said that Signor Fanfani&apos;s statement had been extremely helpful.He had pointed out the questions that we should be facing over the next fewmonths. Signor Fanfani had listed a large number of questions, but he would try to answer most of them, leaving the rest to the afternoon meeting.As regards the British economic position he had indicated that we were confident about our balance of payments. We expected a balance, moving towards an increasing surplus, this year; and we should be able to deal withthe problems of the international borrowing that we had incurred in order to
pay for the inherited deficit. One factor in the present improvement in our situation was admittedly the restriction of domestic demand and thus of our economic growth. But we were tackling with great urgency the underlyingproblems which had meant that, for years, expansion in the United kingdom had been followed by a balance of payments deficit. This question would be solved partly by rapid technological advance and partly by structural alterationsThis governed the answer to Signor Fanfani&apos;s question about the timing of our negotiations. In Parliament Mr. Wilson had said that we would join theCommunity only from a position of economic strength. The answer to signor Fanfani&apos;s question was, therefore, that there should be no need, so far as our economic prospects were concerned, to delay our entry into negotiationsonce the Six were ready.On the Kennedy Round he agreed that it was necessary to decide the kennedy Round discussions in the next few weeks; and he agreed further thatsuccess in the negotiations could well help with the solution of other problemssuch as agricultural, and agricultural trading, questions, which would be centralin any negotiations.On transitional periods he said that they would need to vary according tothe characteristics of each problem, and they would need to be carefully negotiated by agreement with the Six. But this question also raised wider issues ofagricultural policy, which Mr. Brown would deal with later.This brought him to Signor Fanfani&apos;s questions whether we could wait until1969 when the Community was due to review its agricultural policy; how far our interests could be safeguarded by adjustments and protocols, or whether therewould need to be amendments to the actual Treaty of Rome. Signor Fanfani had asked which problems could be dealt with by transitional periods and which required structural adjustments; and he had asked whether, if the latter were required, they would be adjustments to the Treaty or merely to the common agricultural Policy. He would leave the agricultural question to Mr. Brown.But he would like to say that, outside the agricultural field, we were more concerned with the way in which the Treaty worked in practice than with the precise wording. The Community was a living organisation with 10 years&apos;experience behind it; and, although intensive and legalistic study of the text of the Treaty might raise certain doubts, we were more concerned with the spiritin which the Treaty had been operated. He would deal in the afternoon withthe question of the Treaty of Rome generally.As regards the question of starting any negotiations at the point where theywere broken off in 1963, we should wish to hear the views of the ItalianGovernment and of the other members of the Six. We did not wish to get boggeddown in detail and so lose sight of the wider vision. Some of the earlier problemsnow seemed easier, as a result of the passage of time. Some, for example thosearising from the Common Agricultural Policy,. ,rnight have become more difficult.Some could, we believed, be better settled after our entry; but not all, and the initial discussions and negotiations should be therefore concentrated mainly upon this limited number of major issues. Some problems affected the Commonwealth,and we should need to consult with other Commonwealth countries.The question of social insurance involved a major problem of harmonisation;but we saw no fundamental difficulties in this field. The question of free movementof labour would be dealt with by Mr. Brown later.The question of EFTA, and how individual EFTA countries would proceed,was one for each EFTA country. He was not empowered to speak on their behalf.But he thought that EFTA countries recognised that it would be necessary tofollow the rules set by the Community in any application for closer relationships.The general agreement reached at the meeting in December was that efta countries should consult with each other; but he thought that negotiations wouldbe separate.On scientific and technological collaboration he thought it essential that the timing of any discussions should be speedy in this context (because of thefundamental importance of this question to our conception of what the community should look like in the years ahead) and simultaneous with our main negotiationsfor entry into the e.c. (because Britain would be less interested in discussion of
technology whilst outside the Community than as members of it). An essential feature of the question was the widening of market opportunities for Britishindustries with a high technological content a process which should go hand inhand with increased exchanges of technological information, just as wideningopportunities in the British market for Community industries with a hightechnological content should proceed pari passu with the same process. He wouldgive two examples. In the field of nuclear power for electricity generation, theUnited Kingdom could claim to be ahead of the United States and Europe. Inknow-how on chemical engineering, Italy led most other countries of the world,if not all. In either case, if know-how was to be made available it would be essential to be sure that one was not just handing over blueprints but wideningmarket opportunities at the same time.Mr. Wilson said that we had considered the problems involved in fusion ofthe Communities and saw no fundamental difficulty. He agreed in particular thatit was necessary to make more of a reality of the work of EURATOM. We had thought that this question of the merger of the Communities was not a problem in which Britain should intervene whilst still outside the Communities; but weshould, of course, hope to participate in the process once we were members.Signor Funfani interjected that within the Community there were many whothought that fusion should not be unduly delayed. If that was right, it would be helpful if we could say that we were not thinking of a long delay before this process could come to pass.Mr. Wilson said that he believed the worst of all possible positions wouldresult if the Community said, either on this issue, or on the question of politicalunity, that they wanted to complete their final structure before negotiations withthe United Kingdom. But this did not mean that we wanted to hold the processup until we became members. His view would be that the Community should go ahead, while we were still not members, but that the two processes could proceedsimultaneously and that it would be realistic, in planning mergers within the communities, to take account of the possibility that, quite early on, we might be members. We should therefore want to keep closely in touch with the communities during this period. If the fusion of the Communities were a longdrawn-out operation, we should, of course, be negotiating for entry to the threeexisting Communities. We should certainly not wish either process to delay theother. He very much agreed with Signor Fanfani&apos;s remark about the institutionalchanges being dictated by advances in the fields of technology, engineering andparticularly nuclear power. Things which seemed clear only two years ago inthe fuel and energy field had in fact changed rapidly. Our own National plan of 1965 included a chapter on fuel and energy; but this chapter was now out of date, not only because of the discovery of North Sea Gas but also because of fundamental reappraisals caused by the realisation that attomic power could begenerated almost as cheaply as, if not more cheaply than, hydro-electric power in areas where the latter had hitherto been the main source. What was true nationallywas equally likely to be true internationally; and this could well mean that theexisting division between the ECSC and EURATOM was increasingly unreal.There were no discussions proceeding within EFTA for the creation of anEFTA Technological Community. But we were having useful bilateral discussions on several technological questions. This week there would be discussions with france on advanced developments in the aircraft field. The previous week theMinister of Technology, Mr. Wedgwood Benn, had had three days&apos; discussionwith his colleague in Germany. He thought it was better to proceed bilaterally inthis way until it was possible to generalise the discussion of such questions within an enlarged Community.Mr. Wilson said that it had always been our desire to discuss questions ofpolitical unity with the countries of the Community even while we ourselves werenot members. We should certainly be ready to play our full part once we were members. The sooner we were in the Community the sooner we could begin toPlay our part.. We had thought, whilst outside the Community, that we should not intervenejn Community affairs. We had not intervened, nor had we had any status forintervening, in discussions on quasi-political questions within the Six. But, if and when we became members we should be involved in these questions too.  In
view of our new initiative, we thought it would be well to be associated with the six as closely as possible in their discussions on political unity. We believed very strongly that it would be a tragedy if there were any suggestion within the Sixthat this question must be got out of the way in discussions within the Communitybefore there could be any question of negotiating British entry. There were favourable tides at work in favour of European economic and political unity; itwould be a tragedy if we had to wait for the problems to be settled on a restrictedbasis.Signor Fanfani commented that discussion on political unity had gone veryslowly within the Community. It would be very difficult to get any real movementin this sector. The Italians had never tried to make very rapid progress in this field. The Saragat Plan had been intended merely to open up a dialogue; andthe recent initiative taken by Italy aimed not at setting up barriers but at creating a favourable atmosphere for some form of political unity.It was agreed that nothing of substance should be said to the Press at thisstage in the discussions.RECORD OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND THEFOREIGN SECRETARY AND THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER ATPALAZZO CHIGI, ROME, ON 16th JANUARY, 1967, AT 4.30 p.m.Present:The Right Hon.

Walter GardiniDott. Corrado GuerzoniAmb. Gastone GuidottiCslr. Vieri TraxlerDott. Gianfranco PompeiMin. Carlo MarchioriTreaty of Rome and majority votingSignor Moro said that he understood before the meeting had adjourned forlunch that Mr. Wilson wished to refer to the Treaty of Rome.Mr. Wilson said that the United Kingdom position on the Treaty of Rome was,he hoped, perfectly clear. He summarised at this point the statement made in theHouse of Commons in November 1966 by saying that the Government would beprepared to accept the Treaty of Rome subject to the necessary adjustmentsconsequent upon the admission of a new member and provided that we receivedsatisfaction on the points about which we saw difficulty.What he had in mind in saying this was that the Treaty provided in Article 237that the conditions of admission and the adjustments to the Treaty necessitated by it should be the subject of an agreement between the existing member Statesand the new applicant. Clearly there had to be adjustments to the Treaty to coversuch questions as British membership of the institutions, with appropriaterepresentation; provision for an appropriate number of British votes in the Councilof Ministers; and other changes, such as the percentage contribution to theCommunity budget and funds. Various consequential matters would have to bediscussed as regards the timetable on which we should be applying the various
provisions of the Treaty; and this was bound to differ from the timetable laiddown in the Treaty because of the lapse of time since its signature. But the pointhe wanted to emphasise was that, provided our problems could be dealt withsatisfactorily, either through adaptations of the arrangements made under theTreaty or in any other acceptable manner, the Treaty itself would not be an obstacle-Turning to majority voting Mr. Wilson said that he was aware that there weredifferences of view within the Community on this matter. The United kingdom would be prepared to accept majority voting to the same extent as the Sixthemselves. But so long as the differences of opinion were not completely overcomewithin the existing members of the Community and so long as we remained outside,it would be inappropriate for us to express a view and thereby take sides in what we had always regarded as a question to be settled within the Community.Signor Moro said that, if he understood the situation aright, the UnitedKingdom accepted the Treaty of Rome in respect of its structure and aims, except as regards such changes as were provided for by the text of the Treaty itself (forexample, in relation to participation in the work of the Council of Ministers and inthe organs of the Community). There was a question whether additional protocolsand clauses to the Treaty would be necessary and whether they should be temporaryor not. Majority voting was embodied in the Treaty; although there had beendifferences of view within the Community, no member state had yet asked for theTreaty to be altered on that account. There should be no objection to acceptanceof the necessary adjustments to the Treaty; but the safeguarding clauses might present a difficulty. They might be discussed later on.Signor Moro then invited Mr. Brown to discuss the Common agricultural policy.Kennedy RoundMr. Brown recalled that Signor Fanfani had referred to the Kennedy Roundduring the morning&apos;s discussion. The timetable was now so advanced that thecompletion of the Kennedy Round was in sight. The United Kingdom was facedwith problems in relation to the Kennedy Round somewhat different from thosedescribed by Signor Fanfani. There was a marked imbalance between our offersand those made by the Community. Since it was in the common interest of theCommunity and of the United Kingdom to reach agreement at the highest possible level on the offers to be made in the Kennedy Round, he proposed that experts on both sides should discuss how the offers already tabled might be adjusted in orderto achieve the best possible outcome. The United Kingdom had made substantialoffers, markedly to her disadvantage, by comparison with the offers made by theCommunity. Experts on both sides should try to harmonise the differences in theseoffers.Common Agricultural Policy: Problems for the United KingdomTurning to the questions posed by Signor Fanfani about, the common agricultural Policy Mr. Brown said that the different aspects of the policy presentedproblems which were not always of the same gravity; nor did they all call forthe same answer. One question which had been asked dealt with our general attitude to the policy. It was not of itself an impediment to negotiations; butto adjust our agricultural support system to the existing Common agricultural policy would create substantial difficulties for the United Kingdom; unlessadjustments could be made, it would distort our present agricultural pattern andaffect our prices considerably and worsen our trade and balance of payments.Mr. Brown suggested that he should take the four main points of theagricultural problem in ascending order of difficulty.(1) The effect on the cost of livingIf the present level of. prices were maintained in the Community after 1970,we estimated that the effect would be to increase the cost of our food by between10 and 14 per cent. This would obviously have an adverse effect on our policy for prices and incomes and on the cost of living. We would therefore hope fora reduction in the present Community price levels; and this raised the question
of the transitional period over which our economy would be phased into theCommon Agricultural Policy. This was not the most serious problem concerningus, though it was clearly important.(2) The results for our own farmersThe effect on our domestic agricultural system was more serious. It waspossible indeed, some would say it was probable that, as prices stood in theCommunity, the net income of our farmers as a whole would be the same as, oreven greater than, at present. But the real problem was the premium on cerealsproduction which the present arrangements involved. Our farmers would beaffected in two ways under the Community&apos;s cereals policy; they depended uponbuying cheap cereals for feedingstuffs (and the high price of cereals in theCommunity would therefore hit them hard); and they would be affected by importsfrom the Community. The result would be to cause a serious disturbance in theagricultural and ancillary industries of the United Kingdom. The northern and western areas of the country had more rain, contained a larger proportion of land of poor quality, and included most of our small agricultural holdings devoted tothe rearing of livestock and the production of pigmeat and dairy and egg products.The effect of the Community prices would therefore be to depress the conditionof these farmers, while by contrast there would be a considerable accretion of income in the eastern half of the country. Our conclusion was therefore twofold:first, a substantial transitional period would be needed in order to solve theproblems which would be created; and, second, since we should have to changesubstantially the pattern of our agriculture for example in relation to the size of farm units and the methods of marketing we should want schemes to facilitatethese adjustments, including some of our support grants, to qualify for benefit under the provisions of the Community&apos;s Guarantee Fund dealing with &quot; structuralimprovement&quot;.This problem was a more difficult one than the first; but it would not be insuperable if the present members of the Community were willing to help.(3) The impact of Commonwealth and third country trade in foodstuffsIn relation to Commonwealth trade it was well known that there were problems affecting Australia and Canada; but the really difficult case was that of New Zealand.New Zealand was almost wholly dependent upon her agricultural exports, over half of which came to the United Kingdom and amounted to nearly half of NewZealand&apos;s total exports. It was not necessary at this stage for him to rehearsethe figures of dairy produce, mutton, lamb and wool, since they were known tothe experts. New Zealand was one area in which he doubted whether a transitional period would suffice as a final answer to our problems. It seemed likely that a permanent arrangement or derogation would have to be achieved in order to cover New Zealand&apos;s interests in respect of access to her traditionalmarkets at reasonable prices. He hoped that it would be fairly generally accepted that a special arrangement of this sort would^ have to be made; but he would welcome the Italian Government^ views.(4) The consequences for our balance of paymentsWhen Signor Fanfani had referred to this aspect of the Common agricultural policy in the morning&apos;s discussions he had given a figure (which was probablyan under-estimate) of  200 million as the extra burden which would fall upon our balance of payments, if prices remained at their present level in the community and if under the present arrangements we were obliged to make over to the guidance and Guarantee Fund 90 per cent of the proceeds of levies on all food imports from third countries. It was comforting to have heard Signor Fanfaniexpressing how clearly he understood our difficulties. It would be altogetherinequitable for there to be no change in the present arrangements when the UnitedKingdom joined the Community. At present the member country of theCommunity which was the largest importer was Germany, which imported  640million of leviable products, of which  270 million were drawn from sources outsidean enlarged Community (i.e., including Denmark). By contrast we imported 970 million of leviable products, of which  640 million came from third countries.Moreover, acceptance of the present price level would involve us in far greaterprice increases on our imports than any other member country had had to face.As a result we should be expected not only to pay our national contribution tothe Guarantee Fund but also to make from the proceeds of the levies a substantial
payment more than twice what Germany was paying and approximately equalto what was paid by all the other members of the present Community. And yet,because the United Kingdom had a soundly based agricultural economy, whichemployed a very small percentage of our labour force whose productivity had increased yearly, it did not seem likely that we should be able to make morethan a relatively modest call on the Fund. The problem therefore was to consider,first, what was likely to happen to the level of Community prices after 1969;second, what could be done to alter the level of contribution to the Fund in orderto make them fairer on the accession of a new member or members; and, third,to what extent the United Kingdom might be able to retain or have returned toher. a part of the levy proceeds in order to finance &quot; structural &quot; improvements to her domestic agricultural industry.In raising these points he wished to emphasise that we did not reject theCommon Agricultural Policy. The problems which it raised could be met,provided that the other members of the Community accepted that, unless changes were made, the burden imposed on the United Kingdom as a new member wouldbe so unfair as to be politically unmanageable.When Signor Fanfani asked why the United Kingdom had not accepted theCommon Agricultural Policy at an earlier date, Mr. Brown replied that Mr. Wilsonand he were not responsible for United Kingdom policy at that time.Mr. Brown then turned to the particular questions which had been raised.(1) How long a transitional period was envisaged ?The answer would be different according to the aspect of agricultural policyin question. The period might need to be of one length from the point of viewof the increased cost of living, of another length as regards the impact on domesticagricultural policy and different again in relation to the consequences for our balance of payments.(2) Did adjustment to the policy require only transitional periods or did it require a modification to the Common Agricultural Policy ?He considered that the full statement he had just made had answered thesequestions adequately.(3) Could we wait until 1969 when the financial arrangements under the common agricultural Policy would have to be re-negotiated or could our needs bemet during negotiations for entry now ?At this point, Signor Fanfani said that the revision envisaged in 1969 might affect only some, not all, of the problems in question.Mr. Brown said that nevertheless, these were likely to be the most importantproblems so far as we were concerned. In particular as regards the impact onour balance of payments it would be imprudent for us and unwise for the membersof the Community not to try to get a clear understanding, now of the changesenvisaged in 1969 when the present arrangements would fall to be re-negotiated.If mutual understanding could be reached in the present talks, it might be possibleto leave certain problems for solution during the 1969 re-negotiations; but itwould be foolish to leave the whole critical matter unsettled until then.(4) Did the United Kingdom seek only adjustment to the regulations made underthe Treaty of Rome; or a special protocol; or amendments of the actualTreaty ?He understood that a new protocol would in any case be required on our accession; and this might be the most convenient way of settling matters. an amendment of the Treaty itself should not be necessary.(5) What effect would Commonwealth interests have on any negotiations ?He had already mentioned the particular issues arising in connection with australia and Canada. The Commonwealth Sugar Agreement would raiseanother problem.  It might be possible for some Commonwealth countries toconsidered for association with the Community, if Britain were to join, byanalogy with the former French colonial territories in Africa. But New Zealandwould continue to present the gravest obstacle, which could probably not be surmounted by transitional arrangements alone.
(6) Free movement of labourWe saw no fundamental difficulty under this head, provided that there was an adequate transitional period for orderly phasing-in of the free movement ofworkers in order to counter the difficulties which we were bound to meet overimmigration from the Commonwealth.In conclusion, Mr. Brown expressed the view that all these problems couldbe faced and met without necessarily undermining the basis or disrupting theworking of the Common Agricultural Policy. While there would certainly bedomestic difficulties in the United Kingdom, these would be worth facing, Weshould welcome the advice of the Italian Government and the other membersof the Community on how best to arrange our affairs in order to adjust to theCommon Agricultural Policy; and we would ask that it should not be transformedinto a barrier preventing our entry into the Community.Signor Moro said that he understood from Signor Fanfani that some ofthe matters which were rightly causing concern to the United Kingdom had inthe past presented difficulties to the Italian Government. Since he and hiscolleagues had been invited to give advice on the basis of their experience, hethought it might be useful to outline the problems that had arisen and the solutionswhich had been found for them.Signor Fanfani then offered some comments on remarks made by Mr. Brownbefore calling upon Signor Guazzaroni to give a brief account of Italian experience in negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy.As regards the effect on the prices and incomes policy of accepting theCommon Agricultural Policy on its present basis, he suggested that it shouldbe remembered that the present price levels within the Community represented the harmonisation of the various demands made by its members. It would therefore be likely to be a matter of substantial difficulty to meet the UnitedKingdom&apos;s request in full, since the present price levels were the result of a systemof checks and balances which had involved lengthy and detailed discussions.Nevertheless, once a country had become a member of the Community, it dealtwith the other members in a spirit of mutual co-operation and after theexpenditure of great effort, agreement was somehow reached. It was important to remember this in relation to Mr. Brown&apos;s account of the changes in the structure of British agriculture which would be needed in order to adjust to theCommunity&apos;s policy. Italy understood the problems facing the United Kingdomand appreciated the reasons for the British request for varying transitional periods for adjustments to the Common Agricultural Policy. But the United kingdom was perhaps two centuries ahead of Italy in the reform of agricultural land use;and Italy, with its greater area, had still many changes to make. Acceptanceof the Community&apos;s agricultural policy had therefore required far greateradjustments by Italy than by other members of the Community.As regards the Guidance and Guarantee Fund, it was necessary to keep clearly in mind the purposes for which the Fund had beep created. The United Kingdom&apos;sdeficiency payments system would have to be changed in order to conform withthose objectives. The agricultural problems in connection with the commonwealth in general and New Zealand in particular were probably less important now thanthey had been six or seven years earlier. In particular, butter and mutton wouldnot interest Italy greatly, although they might raise more important issues forother member countries of the Community.The size of the levies on imported products was a substantial problem; and, ifItalian experience proved anything, it was the solution would be very difficultto find. It was a great pity that the United Kingdom had been unable toparticipate in the critical discussions of July 1965. What the Community had endeavoured to do was to keep the policy in this field sufficiently flexible to enableunder-developed areas to benefit without at the same time creating conditionswhich would make it impossible for them to make improvements. Italy had notbeen very successful in the 1965 negotiations; and he considered that the ratio ofcontributions to and benefits from the Fund would be one of the most difficultissues to face the United Kingdom.The question of modifying the United Kingdom agricultural structure shouldbe less difficult, including the issues arising from the regional policies to which
Mr Wilson had referred in the morning. But we should not allow ourselves to be too optimistic about the possibility of achieving lower price levels, since the ItalianGovernment themselves had experienced some disappointment in this direction.Mr. Brown had referred to several factors which would affect adjustments to the Common Agricultural Policy in relation to the period of transition. Heaoreed with those views; but the question of the financing of agricultural policy was of prime importance, since the more intensively it was discussed, the moreinevitably it raised questions of the balance of payments and related issues of monetary policy. It was therefore a matter to be treated with some care.What Mr. Brown had said about the timetable for adjusting to the common agricultural Policy was a clear indication of the seriousness of purpose with whichthe United Kingdom had begun their series of talks with the Governments of the six. He had been convinced that the United Kingdom Government would nothave embarked on their present course without considering all the consequences;and he was very glad to have this confirmation of his conviction. He had gainedthe impression that the talks had begun on a good basis and with a real sense of purpose.As regards the question of a special protocol this was envisaged in paragraph 2of Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome, which covered the admission of new members to the Community.The question of relations with the Commonwealth was one which appearedcapable of solution on the analogy of the arrangements which had been made forthe former French colonies in Africa and the successful negotiations which hadbeen undertaken by Nigeria for associate membership.So far as social policies and mobility of labour were concerned, the ItalianGovernment were satisfied with what Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown had said.In conclusion he felt that he was expressing the views of his colleagues whenhe said that in raising with Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown the various issues that hadbeen mentioned their aim was not to discourage their British colleagues but tomake them aware of likely problems. The Italian Government had experiencedproblems themselves and hoped to assist the United Kingdom in preparingthemselves psychologically for the rest of their visits to the capitals of the Six. Ifthere were questions which Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown now wished to address tothe Italian Government, they would be happy to try to answer them.Common Agricultural Policy: The Guidance and Guarantee FundMr. Wilson said that he wished to ask one purely factual question. One ofthe main purposes of the Guidance and Guarantee Fund was to subsidise exports;but the Fund was also used to make grants to assist structural improvement. was there any restriction on the availability of such grants? For example, if Italywished to undertake a new planting programme in an agriculturally backwardarea or wished to improve a strain of livestock or develop land reclamation ordrainage, could grants be made available for such schemes if they were particularlyassociated with regional development? Would it be possible by analogy to apply for grants for similar purposes in, e.g., Scotland or Wales where there was moreland in need of development than in the rest of the United Kingdom?Signor Fanfani said that it was possible to apply for grants for such purposeswithin certain limits. A country making a request for such assistance had toprovide a definite development plan and to contribute itself towards the cost of the improvements, as well as receiving contributions from the Fund. The percentagesvaried between 25 and 35 in such cases.Mr. Wilson said that, while he did not want to go into the detail of percentages,he would like to know whether it would be possible to apply for assistance as partof a development plan, the effect of which would be to safeguard the inhabitants of a depressed area from having to leave agricultural employment and to move toanother part of the country to seek industrial employment. Were there any rulesto prevent the recovery from the Fund of an appropriate percentage for purposesof this kind? &apos;Signor Fanfani explained that finance could be made available for industrialre-training in a case where workers moved from one activity to another, whetherln agricultural or manufacturing industry.   But the new employment had, on the
whole, to be of a higher or more developed character than the old; and he was not sure whether the rules permitted the use of the Fund merely to enable workers tocontinue in the same employment, e.g., in the case of agricultural workers indepressed areas to protect them from the need to transfer to more productiveemployment elsewhere.Common Agricultural Policy: Italy&apos;s experienceSignor Moro then asked Signor Guazzaroni to give a brief account of thenegotiations involved in establishing the Common Agricultural Policy, a matter with which he had been associated for over 10 years.Signor Guazzaroni said that a brief account of the negotiations relating to theCommon Agricultural Policy would demonstrate that Italy had experienced much the same difficulties as those which would now confront the United Kingdom if she decided to apply for membership of the Community. The common agricultural Policy reflected certain contradictions inherent in the Treaty of Rome.Thus, Article 39 of the Treaty emphasised the importance of stabilising markets and ensuring a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, whereasArticle 110 was concerned with the need to abolish restrictions on international trade. Other examples of contradictions were the fact that Germany favouredlow priced imports but asked for the highest grain prices. Italy herself wantedhigh cereal prices for social reasons but sought low prices for feedingstuffs. TheCommon Agricultural Policy had therefore been achieved only by compromiseand by efforts to reconcile different, and even conflicting, interests. The Treatyof Rome laid down that for certain products marketing organisations should beset up. These were designed to ensure specialisation and higher incomes forfarmers based on single commodity prices combined with a common external tariff designed to give protection against imports from outside the Community.Because of the need to reconcile the economies of the various member countriesprices were at present admittedly rather high. There was provision for an annual review of cereals prices starting in July 1967 and of other prices (for exampleolive oil) from July 1968. But it would be liable to be difficult to secure any more extensive arrangements for price reviews because of the difficulty of satisfying the interests of the various members of the Community. These had not provedeasy to reconcile.As regards the financial regulations of the Common Agricultural Policy, these had occupied a month and a half of day and night consultations in 1962, duringwhich conflicting interests had soon become apparent and the Italian Governmenthad had to express their concern in much the same way as the United KingdomGovernment were now expressing theirs.As the financial regulations had originally been envisaged the proceeds of the levies were to be paid over to the Commission at the end of the transitional period and payments out of the Fund were to be confined to the subsidisation ofagricultural export from the Community to third countries. This arrangement would have been in accordance with French policy in so far as it would havereflected the concept that the levies should represent an additional source ofrevenue for the member States and that the extent to which they benefited from itshould depend on the degree to which they co-operated in implementing the newCommon Agricultural Policy or, alternatively, continued import products from third countries in a manner which was not in the interests of the Community.The Italian Government, however, had not been in agreement with this proposalbecause it would have run counter to their efforts to raise the standard of living.They had therefore insisted that, in addition to subsidising exports, the fund should also be used to some extent for effecting structural agricultural improvementswithin the Community. As a result the Fund was used partly for subsidisingexports and partly (to the extent of about one-third) for structural amelioration.It had been decided that for the transitional period up to 1969 the amount devotedto structural amelioration should not exceed 280 million units of account (dollars).The Italian Government had agreed to accept this arrangement because of their desire to achieve a political objective, although they realised that economically and agriculturally it did not fully serve their interests. Indeed, during the first three years of the Common Agricultural Policy Italy had paid out more to the Fundthan she had received from it; and in order to establish equilibrium the ItalianGovernment had sought and obtained a reduction in their budgetary contribution.
As regards Mr. Brown&apos;s suggestion that it was necessary to be satisfied aboutthe financial regulations after the end of 1969, he wished to underline two aspectsof the problem, one positive and one negative. The positive aspect was as follows -when the possibility arose of making over the levies to the Fund, as was envisaged in the transitional period, reference had also been made to making over the proceeds from the Common External Tariff. These joint proceeds taken togetherwould be so enormous (more than $3,000 million) that consideration had beengiven to restoring to member countries any surplus not needed to finance theCommon Agricultural Policy. The negative aspect was that this situation involved the resources of the Community itself (as distinct from those of the member States),and this had raised the problem of democratic control over the Commission^ useof these resources and so of elections to a European Parliament which wouldoversee the very wide economic authority of the Commission.At this point Mr. Wilson said that, while he would welcome further discussion on the Common Agricultural Policy, it might be appropriate to adjourn thediscussions until the following morning. At that point the discussions might alsodeal with the movement of capital and the question of regional development.Signor Moro suggested that the discussions should be resumed at 10 a.m thefollowing morning; and that the Press might be told, in answer to enquiries, thatthe two sides had been discussing agricultural problems, without, however, being given any details of the course of the discussions.This was agreed and the meeting adjourned at 6.45 p.m.RECORD OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND THEFOREIGN SECRETARY AND THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER ATPALAZZO CHIGI, ROME, ON 17th JANUARY, 1967, AT 10 a.m.The Right Hon.

Carlo MarchioriSignor Moro recalled that on the previous day the discussion had centred onadjustments of the Treaty of Rome and on the Common Agricultural Policy, tieinvited Mr. Wilson to say what other issues he wished to discuss.Mr. Wilson agreed that a lot of ground had been covered in the discussions on16th January and that these had dealt effectively with a number of problems. he considered that after the helpful and exhaustive account of the development of the  common agricultural policy it would be useful if Mr. Brown drew together our conclusions. Capital movements and regional problems might then be discussed.
Common Agricultural PolicyMr. Brown said that the previous day&apos;s discussion had shown that there was clear understanding between the two Governments about the problems which would fall to be dealt with in relation to agricultural policy if the United Kingdom acceded to the Treaty of Rome. He was encouraged by the sympathetic understandingmanifested by his Italian colleagues. The United Kingdom did not reject thecommon agricultural policy; nor did she maintain that her own agricultural policy could not be adjusted to it. For their part the Italian Government understood thatthere were areas of difficulty which would have to be faced; and he thought it wouldbe convenient to restate them.(1) Our internal cost of living would be affected by the increase in our food prices. This was the least of the areas of difficulty; but it was still an important onebecause of our attempt to stabilise our own prices and incomes.(2) The pattern of prices in the Community would have a distorting effect onour pattern of agricultural production. Great efforts would be required to solvethis problem which would call for consideration of the extent to which we could use some of the levy payments for the purpose of reshaping our agriculture.(3) The problem of the effect on Commonwealth food trade of the common agricultural policy did not appear to be insuperable; but he wished to re-emphasiseour concern for New Zealand for which we had particular responsibility. he hoped that it would be agreed that something more than transitional arrangements would be needed to cope with New Zealand&apos;s problems. This could possibly bedone by a multilateral arrangement analogous to the informal butter agreement we already had.(4) The effect on our balance of payments of the higher prices of imported food and of our contributions to the Guarantee Fund would be the most important ofthe problems; and the substantial amounts which would fall to be paid by usacross the exchanges if the present arrangements for levy payments were not changed would have very serious consequences for us. When Signor Fanfani had mentioned a figure the previous day of  200 million this had appeared to be anunder-estimate. Further examination of the problem confirmed that our payments would probably be in excess of  200 million. When we joined the common market, we would substantially increase its size and thus the interests of its presentmembers. It was therefore not unreasonable to ask the member States to consider how, within a larger Community, our interests and those of the present members might be reconciled. This was not a matter as was sometimes suggested in otherquarters of asking the existing members to alter the structure of the Community.We merely asked that what had been done already for the Six should be done for new members of the Community in other words to make such modifications aomight be needed to take care of the interests of the acceding members. Theexisting members of the Community had taken account of their own interests inthe earlier negotiations; it was not unreasonable to ask them to take account of our interests now.Signor Moro said that he had noted which issues were considered important and where adjustments were likely to be needed under the Treaty of Rome. HisBritish friends now understood the difficulties with which the Italian Governmenthad been faced and had heard an account of Italian experience in surmountingvarious problems. The Italian Government knew what the essential Britishinterests were and hoped they would be taken into account, if and whennegotiations for accession took place. Mr. Brown had mentioned adjustments whichhad been made in the past and had suggested that similar adjustments would now be required to meet Britain&apos;s position. The Italian Government agreed thatadjustments were required both because their interests were similar to those ofthe United Kingdom and because they favoured United Kingdom accession for political reasons. But it was essential to be realistic. He was sure that Mr.Wilson and Mr. Brown would approach the problem of accession realistically-They would find that they would receive different treatment in each of the countries of the Six they listed. The Italian attitude was a very open one; but other member countries for various political reasons might express different shades of view.It was only realistic for Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown to bear this in mind in their further travels. He noted that it had been suggested by Mr. Brown that the six and the United Kingdom should draw nearer together in the final negotiations in
the Kennedy Round and that the United Kingdom had tabled more generousoffers than had the European Economic Community. The suggestion that expertsshould discuss these matters together was a delicate matter which he would preferSignor Fanfani to deal with.Signor Fanfani said that, if certain special problems could be adequatelysolved, they could contribute favourably to the success of the negotiations, whichhe hoped would take place. Certain conditions would have to be fulfilled if thewishes shared by the United Kingdom and Italian Governments were to become a reality. He found it entirely natural that the United Kingdom should state thedifficulties she foresaw as she approached each of the members of the Community.No doubt the United Kingdom would take advantage of their soundings to find out the individual difficulties which each of the countries of the Six foresaw inreceiving the United Kingdom into the Community. If these difficulties were tobe overcome, they must be clearly understood. It was not for him to suggestwhat difficulties other countries would mention, since he was not briefed to speak on matters which were the concern of the other members.On the previous day there had been a discussion of certain concreterequirements which would have a psychological importance in negotiations for entry into the Community. He noted that the United Kingdom Government wereprepared to take account of the implications for manpower and mobility oflabour. He need not therefore stress how important such problems were to theItalian Government, although the question of manpower might become somewhat less important because of certain developments taking place in Italy.While he would not mention the details of what had been termed &quot; the battle of the oranges &quot;, Italy had to safeguard her interests in fruit and vegetables. Itwould be wrong to upset the present balance of interests of the Six (which hadbeen achieved only after considerable negotiation) in order to accommodate theUnited Kingdom&apos;s entry. On the previous day Mr. Brown had mentioned theposition of farmers in his own constituency. The Italian Minister of Agriculture,who was a Sicilian, would be present at any negotiations for entry and wouldcertainly re-state the Italian Government^ difficulties at that stage, especially since there was no intention of adding to the United Kingdom&apos;s problems afternegotiations had taken place.The problem of fruit and vegetables had been discussed in the previous negotiations in 1962. He had been reminded that the Italians had not been entirelysatisfied with the outcome at that time. He mentioned this not with any intentionof raking over the old ground again but merely in order to remind the UnitedKingdom of the attitude of Italy in future negotiations. The United KingdomGovernment should consider carefully the agreement reached by the Six as regardscertain areas and zones, since it provided certain opportunities which they mightinvestigate and exploit in the interests of those areas in the United Kingdom whichmight be adversely affected.The previous day a reference had been made to happy co-operation betweenItalian patriots and the British during the 19th century. It he might echo a 19thcentury saying, he did not remain insensitive to the cry of pain uttered by Mr.Brown on the subject of the prospective additional charge of  200 million on theBritish balance of payments. The Italians knew from their own experience whatexpenditure was involved in contributions to the Guarantee Fund. The UnitedKingdom had made some calculations of the sums involved; so had the ItalianGovernment. Although they were not in possession of all the facts, they consideredthat it might be possible for the British Government to obtain some compensationfor their payments to the Fund in savings on deficiency payments to British farmers.Mr. Brown interjected that, while the domestic agricultural policy of the UnitedKingdom would be changed in such a way as to transfer agricultural supportcosts from deficiency payments paid out of the Exchequer to payments made bythe consumers, that would not offset the extra charge on the balance of payments.Signor Fanfani said that he realised this. But it was necessary to think of anew equilibrium within the economy as a whole; and Italy&apos;s own experienceconfirmed that the determining consideration must be the overall balance ofadvantage in terms of resources. Italy had been the guinea-pig in operating theGuarantee Fund and to use a medical metaphor, whereas wounds might beinflicted by the Common Agricultural Policy, there was a salve to be found for
them. The Fund was very much a matter of give and take among the members ofthe Community.Finally, with a view to widening the membership of the Community, hesuggested that a way should be sought of finding such adjustments of time andsuch transitional periods as might be necessary to cover the agricultural problemsof the Commonwealth and, in particular, of New Zealand. Although NewZealand certainly presented a special case, he hoped that it could be dealt with.In mentioning these problems, he was inspired not by pessimism but by realism.The problems he had mentioned could be solved; and he thought it possible forthe United Kingdom to become a member of the Community.Mr. Wilson suggested that the discussion of agricultural matters might nowend. But he assured Signor Fanfani that we had made the calculations whichhe had mentioned. Our conception of the Common Market went beyond merecalculations, although we had obviously to balance the gains and losses whichwe would experience under the Common Agricultural Policy. Signor Fanfanihad mentioned the use of salves; but it was essential to get the right salve forthe right wound. A salve for a sore foot was not of much value if the woundwas in the jugular vein.Capital movementsTurning to capital movements, Mr. Wilson said that his Government had attempted to evaluate the effect of joining the Community on capital movementswhich were likely to occupy an important place in the negotiations. the distinction inside the Community between direct investment and portfolio investment had a particular bearing on the United Kingdom&apos;s problem. given  an adequate period of adjustment, we wanted our businessmen to be able to invest in the Community and the Community&apos;s businessmen to be able to investin the United Kingdom. Indeed, this was an essential corollary of technologicalco-operation. But the question of portfolio investment was a separate matter,which affected Britain rather differently from the other members of the Community.We were traditionally a major capital market, which currently enforced a fairlystrict control over portfolio investment. But the liberalisation of such investment as prescribed within the Community, would be liable to expose Britain to therisk of a capital drain via the Community to third countries, not excluding theUnited States. Whereas we could see advantage in using our capital for developing the industries of Europe, it was less clear that it would be in our interests to provide capital by portfolio investment in Europe which might thenbe used to finance the growth of American industry through the purchase of dollar securities. It was possible that his own lack of enthusiasm for thedevelopment by British capital of United States industry might be shared in oneor two other capitals of the Community. He would rather see British and community capital and technology pooled in order to develop, e.g., a strongEuropean computer industry than have our capital flowing through portfolio investment via the Community to the United States and being used to build upthe United States computer industry which might then dominate that of theCommunity. This was a problem for technical experts to examine if and when we embarked on negotiations for entry into the Community on the basis ofthe necessary distinction between direct and portfolio investment which he had outlined.Signor Fanfani then suggested that Signor Ortona might say something atthis stage, since he had consulted Signor Colombo, the Italian Minister of theTreasury, and had both political and technical knowledge of the subject.Signor Ortona said that the relevant Community Directives distinguishedbetween portfolio and direct investment but did not deal fully with the exchange control implications. Under Articles 63 and 74, the Treaty of Rome providedultimately for the complete mobility of capital. But in the same Articles werecontained certain reservations which had led to moderate control of both portfolioand direct investment. Since no definitive regulations had yet been approved,it was all the more useful to know at this stage the views of the United Kingdom.The members of the Community were naturally concerned to take account of theUnited kingdom&apos;s monetary position, since, over the next two or three years-there would presumably have to be continuing co-operation between the United
Kingdom and those Governments in support of sterling. He could thereforesay on behalf of the Italian Minister of the Treasury, that very sympathetic consideration would be given to the United Kingdom&apos;s proposals in this field.Moreover, while the need for co-operation in the short-term was understood, theItalian Governments experts considered the long-term prospects for sterling tobe more favourable. If, as they hoped, negotiations took place for the UnitedKingdonfs entry to the Community, the Italian Government would await astatement of our requirements. He considered that the way in which Mr. wilson had approached the matter was the correct one and would prevent certain countries from trying to turn the investment argument against Britain and touse it as a reason for opposing British entry to the Community on the groundthat the United Kingdom was asking for exceptional treatment in this respect.Italy was ready to co-operate over the details of our proposals on theunderstanding that the Community would probably have made definitiveregulations by the date of Britain&apos;s entry.Mr. Wilson asked whether that meant that the definitive regulations wouldhave been concluded before our negotiations began.Signor Ortona said that a lot of work had been done in preparation fordrawing up the regulations and it was possible that the work would be concludedbefore British entry. But he could not be definite at the moment; it might bebefore or after.Mr. Wilson said that the situation was in some respects akin to the situationin relation to EURATOM as Signor Fanfani had described it the previous day.It was important that we should understand each others&apos; problems in this as inother matters.Mr. Wilson said that it might follow that, in the event of British entry intothe Community, or even perhaps independently of it, a useful subject for studymight be the question of restrictions on Community portfolio investment in third countries. He thought that the present system might lead, to use a medicalmetaphor, to a permanent bleeding in that we might all be unnecessarily financing the economic development of rich countries.The problem was difficult to assess at this stage until it was finally known,for instance, what the Swiss attitude to association with the Community might be.Switzerland, a world capital market, could in this respect be a considerable force for good or ill.Mr. Wilson added that while the broader questions of monetary policy were also proper for discussion in the e.c. it was of course right that they should bediscussed in a wider context e.g., at the forthcoming meeting between theChancellor of the Exchequer and certain other finance Ministers (including SignorColombo and the Secretary of the United States Treasury) and in the continuingdiscussions between the Group of Ten and the IMF.Signor Fanfani said that he found Mr. Wilson&apos;s remarks of great interest, for two reasons. Mr. Wilson had put his finger on the problem of financing richcountries at the possible expense of lesser developed countries. The Italians were also interested because of the position of Milan which had greatly developed asa centre of capital movement.Mr. Wilson concluded that there was a good prospect of Community andBritish positions being close together on this question.Regional policiesMr. Wilson then turned to the question of regional policies. The Italians had10 years&apos; experience within the e.c. and he would be grateful to hear something of it. Our own development areas were largely industrial, not agricultural innature, though there were some relatively depressed farming areas also. He would ask Mr. Brown to set out the questions on which we sought information.Mr. Brown said that there were two major economic areas in which we hadbeen able to make great use of Italian experience. They were those of regional policy and industrial reorganisation as exemplified in Italy by the operations ofIRI. When Secretary of State for Economic Affairs he had himself visited rome and, following discussions with Italian Ministers had been able to import a good
deal of Italian experience into our own development policy and the 1958-59. he wanted to enquire what the effects of Community membership had been on Italianhandling of these regional questions. In the United Kingdom we had more thanone problem. There were regions based on old-style heavy industry, which weredeclining relatively and needed to be refashioned. There were other areas wherethe agricultural pattern needed changing to prevent de-population. And, finally,as in other countries, there was an enormous &quot; pull &quot; of activity and populationtowards a &quot; rich triangle &quot;, which in our case was in the South East. When wejoined the Community the third of these problems would be accentuated&apos;communications and other factors would increase the attraction of the South Eastfor industry.We employed a number of measures to counteract this situation. The positiveinducements which we offered should, he thought, cause no trouble to theCommunity since they should be valid under their rules. But we also had onenegative control to serve as a backing for the positive inducements. This was our ability to refuse industrial development certificates the right to set up a new business or expand an existing one in over-developed areas. It was important toknow whether, after entry, we could maintain such a negative control, which wasa strong part of our present armoury. If and when we joined the Community,however, a particular problem might arise from industry&apos;s ability to circumventthe negative control by moving to other countries. He raised these questions notto suggest that they were obstacles to our joining the Community but to enquirewhat Italian experience might have been in these or similar respects.Signor Fanfani said that it was one of the fundamental requirements of theCommunity to harmonise the development of its different parts and different countries. The Community therefore sought to eliminate the existence of relatively backward areas both in the industrial and agricultural field; and theysupported retraining of labour forces for this purpose. Until very recently theCommunity had set its face against direct subsidisation of agriculture; the general feeling was that agriculture should be made competitive. He mentioned an exception made in the case of olive oil because it had some relation to the questionof deficiency payments made to British farmers. But he stressed that this was an exception. It remained the Community&apos;s intention and purpose to consider anddeal with the question of individual regions and sectors within the community in the light of the general intention that they should not constitute parasiticalelements within the Community. An outstanding example was the Italianshipbuilding industry. This had been not only an economic but a political andelectoral question. 10,000 blank votes had been cast in Trieste in the last electionbecause of the measures they had had to take. But, faced with a virtual ultimatumfrom the Community to eliminate non-profit-making shipyards they were carrying through a four-year reorganisation plan. As a result Leghorn had virtually lostits shipyards; La Spezia was going the same way; there was reduced activity at genoa and concentration in Monfalconi. There had been some delay andpostponement of this programme; and there would be a law permitting some temporary support. But it would be only temporary. Other examples werereorganisations in the coal mines at Carbona and the question of the Siciliansulphur mines. The Community did not catch up with everything that washappening within its borders. But their policy was opposed to the continued existence of depressed areas and sought to promote the elimination of dead woodwherever possible.But there was also a positive aspect in Community action. They took actionneeded to bring about changes both in the agricultural and industrial fields. Hehad mentioned yesterday the loans made from the Community Guidance fund to assist structural alteration in agriculture. In the industrial field the Communityintervened in the question of industrial polarisation. The Community had madeinvestigations on the subject in the Italian south (at Brindisi, Bari, etc.) and wastrying to support the development of these areas. He had already mentioned the eec policy of retraining to deal with unemployment and to facilitate movementof labour from one country to another. He should also mention the operations of the European Investment Bank, the use of whose funds followed a priordetermination of the possibility for development. The Investment Bank was opennot only to the Six but to associated countries such as Greece and Turkey.
Mr. Wilson enquired to what extent the regional development policies of theItalian Government were ruled out or circumscribed by the Community. he mentioned that in the United Kingdom there was a differential system of investment grants for development areas, justified on purely regional grounds.Signor Fanfani said it was the general rule that incentives were excluded;but it was not difficult to justify exceptions. The Community did not intervenesurgically but hoped to achieve gradual change from one situation to another. Hequoted the prohibition on State aids in Article 92 (1) of the Treaty of Rome; butthere were several exceptions provided for by Articles 92 (2) and 92 (3) inparticular the Italian Southern Development Fund was compatible with Article92(3) which provided for aid for the economic development of regions wherethere was serious poverty or under-employment.Mr. Brown said he thought that Article 92 (3) (a), (b) and (c) covered the positive measures undertaken in the United Kingdom but he wondered what thesituation would be as regards our negative control. Could the Italians say whetherthey had any experience in these questions? Mr. Wilson said he took it that,e.g, measures to discourage investment in Birmingham would be acceptable underthe Treaty if there was no discrimination on national grounds. But was it thecase that controls of this sort designed to achieve balance within an economy would be compatible with the Treaty?Signor Moro replied that logic suggested that measures of this kind wouldbe compatible with the Treaty. But Italy had no experience of the question, since they had no disincentives of their own. Signor Fanfani added that the ItalianConstitution limited the Italian Government to taking positive action.ConclusionMr. Wilson then summed up. He thanked the Italian Ministers for givingtheir time and said he was much encouraged by the discussion which had takenplace. He thought that the problems which we saw could be overcome by suchmeans as those which had been examined on the previous day either after our entryor by goodwill and co-operation on both sides during the negotiations preceding it.There was a general feeling on both sides that those negotiations, if we undertookthem, should be fairly short and should concentrate mainly on a relatively small number of major issues, so as to avoid the risk of getting bogged down in detail.Finally it would be seen that some problems such as our attitude to the Treatyof Rome and some other questions which outside commentators had thoughtwould divide Britain from the Community were not likely to do so; the bigoutstanding problem was the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy,particularly so far as its financial provisions were concerned. The Communityregulations had been drawn up for countries which as a whole were food exporters;and this fact must inevitably create a serious problem for a country which, like theUnited Kingdom, was a food importer on a large scale. The maximum ingenuityand goodwill would be needed to solve this problem.Signor Moro thanked Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown for the friendly and constructive conversations, conducted with great frankness and cordiality. Hethought it had been possible to subject the problems involved in British entry toa realistic examination. He concluded that many were easy to solve, that others were more difficult, but that none were insuperable. His hope and trust were that the way was open for further progress. He confirmed the great political importance which the Italian Government attached to British membership of a community which provided the basis for a potentially united Europe. Theywould do all they could to facilitate British entry.A Press statement was agreed.
RECORDS OF CONVERSATIONS IN PARISRECORD OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND THEFOREIGN SECRETARY AND THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE ANDTHE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER AT THE ELYSEE PALACE INPARIS ON TUESDAY. 24th JANUARY, 1967, AT 10 a.m.Present:The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, m p General de GaulleThe Right Hon. George Brown, mp M. Couve de MurvilleMr. A. M. Palliser M. AndronikovBackground to the United Kingdom initiativeAfter General de Gaulle had welcomed the Prime Minister, he assented toMr. Wilson&apos;s suggestion that it might be useful if he set out quite fully the purposes and intentions of the British initiative towards Europe.The Prime Minister said that, as he had told the House of Commons on10th November, Her Majesty&apos;s Government had decided on a new high levelapproach in which they would be meeting the Heads of Government of the member countries of e.c. to see whether the conditions existed- or did not exist for negotiations about possible British entry into the Community. After these sixvisits were over the British Government would decide whether or not to activate thearrangements for negotiating for entry and the timing of such negotiations.The Prime Minister wished General de Gaulle to understand that, as he had said in his original statement, &quot; we are approaching these discussions with the clearintention and determination to enter the Community if, as we hope, our essentialBritish and Commonwealth interests can be safeguarded.  We mean business.&quot;As the French President knew, the Prime Minister had asked that a copy ofhis speech the previous day in Strasbourg should be conveyed before delivery toGeneral de Gaulle. He would not, therefore, cover the same ground.The Prime Minister said that there were five main points about the Britishapproach to Europe:(1) The Treaty of Rome. Her Majesty&apos;s Government believed that this neednot be an obstacle provided that their problems could be dealt with satisfactorily,whether through adaptations of the arrangements made under the Treaty or inany other acceptable manner. Her Majesty&apos;s Government were therefore preparedto accept the Treaty.(2) If the negotiations resulted in Her Majesty&apos;s Governments entry, theywould fully carry out all the obligations they would assume on entering theCommunity.(3) In addition to carrying out all the obligations entailed by membership ofthe Community, Her Majesty&apos;s Government wanted to go further. They would hope to strengthen the Community by what they could contribute, not only in thedevelopment of existing arrangements for co-operation under the Treaty, but alsohy doing anything further in their power to develop much closer co-operation, forexample, in the field of European technology.(4) Her Majesty&apos;s Government did not see British entry, therefore, as in anyway likely to weaken the Community: they believed that it would strengthen it.And that was what they meant to see that their entry achieved.
(5) Her Majesty&apos;s Government further believed that, from now on, not only inthese six visits but still more in the subsequent negotiations if these proved possiblethey should concentrate on the big issues raised by the question of their entry, both those within the Treaty of Rome and existing arrangements under it, and other issues which, though not related directly to the Treaty or indeed to decisions taken under the Treaty, might be regarded by any member of the Community as being raised by their entry. Many of the detailed issues could best be settled after british entry through the usual processes and working arrangements which the six countries had developed over the past 10 years. Moreover many of these issues,the discussion of which had taken so much time during the previous negotiation,had changed-some of them fundamentally-since then.Indeed, the passage of time had frankly made some of the problems a gooddeal easier for Her Majesty&apos;s Government. In the very full study they had made ofthe whole question before the Prime Ministers announcement to Parliament inNovember, they had given their attention not only to the actual provisions of theTreaty of Rome, but, no less, to the actual way in which it was working. her majesty&apos;s Government were conscious of the problems vitally affecting their national interests, as other members of the Six had been throughout. They were impressed by the way in which whatever the pressures for a legalistic approach-there hadbeen a growing spirit of realism in the actual operation of the Community and much more desire to treat it as a living and growing organism-reflecting the needs and interests of its members-rather than as the formalistic and rigid institutionwhich some people had hoped it would become, and other people-including theBritish-had feared it might become. They had studied with interest, for example,the issues which had come to a head and the way those issues had been resolvedthe previous year at the Luxembourg meeting.United Kingdom economic situationHer Majesty&apos;s Government knew that the entry of a country like Britain raisedbig problems for France as well as for other members of the Community; but some of the Press comment on this in several countries had been a little beside thepoint. There had been widespread concern about Britain&apos;s economic position. Hewas glad to say that this was now very much stronger than before. But there hadbeen two major changes in the British situation over the past two years. First,politically. When the Labour Government came to power in 1964 they had a tinymajority which could have been imperilled at any time by a few deaths or accidentsto individual members. But now they had a very substantial majority and thecountry could look forward to a long period of firm and stable government. Thiswould certainly continue for the next four years and he was confident that it wouldlast well beyond that. Indeed certain commentators talked of Labour rule for thenext 10 to 15 years. He thought that many of their allies and partners, whether inthe Six Common Market countries or in EFTA, Would like to enjoy the political stability now enjoyed by France and Britain, but by few other countries in theworld.Secondly, there had been an equally marked change in the British economicsituation. Two years earlier the Labour Government had inherited a balanceof payments deficit running at an annual rate of  800 million and a big tradingdeficit as well. But the payments deficit had now already been cut to a fraction of the one the Government had inherited. They should be in balance in thepresent year and indeed moving into surplus. There was a similar situation inthe trading position which could most effectively be illustrated by comparison of the situation in the past three years. In 1964 we had an average monthlytrading deficit of  45 million, in 1965 this had been cut to  23 million and in 1966reduced again to  12 million. Indeed, in the past three months Britain had been running a trade surplus such as had rarely been seen in our history.Many of the difficulties we had had for example the weakness of sterling,where the French Government and the Bank of France as well as other countries had given valuable assistance were the direct result of the fact that Her Majesty sGovernment had not been paying their way abroad. But now they were: andthey intended to keep it that way.
(5) Her Majesty&apos;s Government further believed that, from now on, not only inthese six visits but still more in the subsequent negotiations if these proved possiblethey should concentrate on the big issues raised by the question of their entry, both those within the Treaty of Rome and existing arrangements under it, and other issues which, though not related directly to the Treaty or indeed to decisions taken under the Treaty, might be regarded by any member of the Community as being raised by their entry.

Two years earlier the Labour Government had inherited a balanceof payments deficit running at an annual rate of  800 million and a big tradingdeficit as well. But the payments deficit had now already been cut to a fraction of the one the Government had inherited. They should be in balance in thepresent year and indeed moving into surplus.

But now they were: andthey intended to keep it that way.
The Prime Minister recalled that at their last meeting he and Generalje Gaulle had recognised that they disagreed about certain things but agreedabout many others; and in particular they were agreed on the need, in a very real sense of the word, to achieve independence for their countries of a kind that was impossible if they were not paying their way. That had been her majesty&apos;s Governments first objective all other considerations had beensubordinated to it and some very tough and unpopular measures had been necessary to achieve it.All the monetary and financial problems including those which he knewwere in the GeneraFs mind fell into a very different perspective once britain had a balance of payments surplus, compared with a debilitating deficit. Andthey took on a different aspect as well, when looked at from the point of viewof a country such as Britain which was determined to stand on its own feeteconomically and be neither dependent nor a drag on any others. Of coursethere were problems, financial and monetary, and they were ready to discuss them with France and with her colleagues in the Community. The PrimeMinister said he had been into this very deeply. He did not believe there wasa problem here that could not be solved.As regards national economic problems, the Prime Minister recalled that france had been facing these problems too and General de Gaulle had dealtwith them. In fact they were still unsolved when France had signed the Treatyof Rome and very tough, stern action had had to be taken shortly afterwards.General de Gaulle had inherited, as the world knew, a problem of internalinflation and a problem of an over-valued currency at that time. Britain for herpart had internal problems to tackle and had tackled them. The Prime ministers aid that in his statement in the House he had insisted that Britain&apos;s economymust be strong as Her Majesty&apos;s Government were making it strong beforeentry into the Community and that the pound sterling should be standing no lessfirm and high than it was on that day. The pound was now standing firm and high. Britain&apos;s balance of payments was strong; sterling was strong. britain was fully competitive in world markets in some of the toughest of these she had increased her exports by some 25 per cent per annum over the years.The Prime Minister said that two years earlier he had told General de Gaullethat his aim was to ensure the integrity and independence of British industry from the outside domination that inevitably resulted from dependence on others forthe technological processes that determined future industrial advance. He had told the General that the Governments first action had been to prevent atakeover of the British computer industry by the Americans. These had beenbrave words; but they had meant what was said and had now achieved a viablecomputer industry. Not only had an American takeover in,this field thus been prevented but the British computer industry was now going into the european market in competition with that of the United States. But these problems couldonly be solved, as the Prime Minister had always argued, on the basis of a larger;market than that in a single country with 50 million; or indeed in any other european country.TechnologyTwo years earlier the Prime Minister had told the General of his hopes that britain and France could work together, not only for Britain and France butfor Europe as a whole, if they were to achieve a strong and independent industrial structure in Europe. Much useful work had since been done in the aircraftfield and in civil technology. He emphasised that, if we did not make this connection-operative effort, however much we built up our military defences in Europe,all this would be barring the front door and leaving the back door open.Industrial independence was the pre-requisite of political and, even more, ofmilitary independence. Both France and Britain had to pay the price of notbuilding up that rugged industrial independence which could make them proofagainst humiliating industrial takeovers.Problems of United Kingdom entry of course British entry involved certain problems for us, for France and theother members of the Six. First, the Treaty of Rome itself. He had studiedthe Treaty and could say that it did not appear to present any major problems,
as far as Britain was concerned. There were problems about agriculture-particularly some of the financial arrangements which would need in any caseconsequential changes on the entry of a new member, especially one which wasa large food importer. But he was not at all sure that Britain could not workout some agricultural arrangements which, while helping to solve some of herdifficulties, could be of possible advantage to France. He saw no need for Franceand Britain to be opposed on this issue. As he had said in his Strasbourg speechhe thought that in certain respects, especially in cereals, agreement betweenthem should be perfectly possible. But that was a matter for discussion andultimate negotiation. So was the question of capital movements, which wasdealt with under the Treaty but where great realism had been shown in practice to meet the special needs of the existing members. There were problems arisingout of our Commonwealth trade arrangements, some of which he thought couldbe dealt with under the heading of agriculture.The Prime Minister repeated that he believed that these were problems to besettled by discussion; and, again, he expressed the hope that, if Britain and the six were subsequently to have negotiations, they would be able to keep themshort, clear and based on the big issues and not on the morass of detail which hadbogged them down before. He hoped that, during the two days of talks in Paris,Britain and France could get to grips with the main problems though clearly notin a final or negotiating sense and also that, both in the talks with the french ministers and in the final talks together on the following day, they should be ableto deal not only with the questions arising out of the Treaty of Rome and decisions taken under it, but also with those broader questions which obviously both he andthe General had in mind as being raised by British entry into the Community.France and Britain&apos;s role in europe the Prime Minister apologised for the length of his opening remarks but saidthat he felt it had been the President^ wish that there should be this full explanation of the British position. (General de Gaulle indicated assent.) What he wassuggesting was that the whole issue could not just be considered in bilateral termsor in terms of the detailed economic issues that dominated the discussions four or five years ago. There were far bigger issues at stake. The essential one was whether we could hope to build up Europe, as the General and he understoodEurope, with the purpose of breaking down tension between East and West. BothFrance and Britain had a vital role to play a slightly different role perhaps-butthey had to be able to play it together. France and Britain had very specialrelations not only with their Western European partners but unlike some of thosein the West with the Soviet Union. The French Government had had close contact with the Soviet leadership and so had Her Majesty&apos;s Government. TheGeneral and he knew what problems had to be solved if the Soviet Union was tohave the reassurance she needed if the wider European unity that they both believedin was to be achieved. General de Gaulle&apos;s two meetings with Mr. Kosygin in theprevious year in Moscow and in Paris; the Prime Ministers own two meetings in moscow; and M. Couve de Murville&apos;s talks and those of Mr. George Brown withthe Soviet Government had also, he thought, underlined for both of them what this essential reassurance must be, and he had no doubt that Mr. Kosygin&apos;forthcoming visit to London would again re-emphasise this. The President andhe were both committed to doing everything they could to make a reality of the unity of Western Europe. But they both knew that this would be an emptyachievement unless it led first to an easing of tension and then to an honourableand lasting settlement of the outstanding problems that still divided Europe, Westfrom East. This was something for which they had both hoped and striven for20 years; and in the case of General de Gaulle, even longer than that. As membersof a united European Community they both should be better able to achieve.it.But he did not think that this would be possible unless together they pulled their full weight, in the most complete sense of that word, and did so not only withinthe alliance but also more generally. Europe had an even wider role to play in theworld at large; but she would not be able to play it unless she were powerful andthat meant economically powerful. The task of the great European Powers-ofFrance and of Britain was not to be mere messenger boys between the two great powers. They had a bigger role to play and other nations wished them to playit than merely waiting in the ante-rooms while the two Great Powers settledeverything direct between themselves. That was why France and Britain had to
make effective their enormous potential industrial strength by giving that strengtha chance to operate on a European and not a national scale, or series of nationalscales. Only if France and Britain did this could they exert all that went with industrial strength and independence in terms of Europe&apos;s influence in world affairs.General de Gaulle thanked the Prime Minister for his statement. He hadbeen greatly interested by it and by the way in which it was expressed. First, hewas particularly struck by the great difference in what the Prime Minister was now saying about Europe in general and the Common Market in particular,compared with the British attitude throughout the years since he had had the honour of directing French affairs. He remembered Britain&apos;s refusal to participatewhen the Common Market was being negotiated. He recalled Mr. Macmillanspeaking about &quot; economic warfare &quot; and making clear his hope that the common market would fail. He remembered Mr. Heath involving the european governments in interminable negotiations in Brussels which had inevitablyproduced no result. He also remembered the Prime Ministers own statementsbefore he came to office and, indeed, thereafter. He had understood that theBritish Government were not then favourable to the possibility of economic integration within the Common Market. But now he took note of the very substantial change in the British position and he had listened with great attentionto the Prime Minister^ exposition of it. He took note with interest of the great difference between the past and what was apparently the present British attitude-General de Gaulle said that he had also been greatly struck by what the PrimeMinister had said and had implied in his remarks about independence. Formany years and particularly during the war, when he supposed that it had been an inescapable fact of life he had observed that Britain appeared to wish atalmost any cost to maintain a special role with the United States. This had evenbeen true in regard to Britain&apos;s relations with continental Europe; Sir winston churchill had expounded the doctrine of European unity but had made it clearthat such unity was all right for the Europeans but not for the British. The british attitude had been similar within NATO and particularly in the way that the Britishnuclear force had been integrated with the nuclear force of NATO which meantin effect the nuclear force of the United States. For many years this had apparently been a clearly defined British policy and general attitude. Now, as he understoodit, the Prime Minister was saying that things had changed and that Britain soughtindependence in the same way as France sought it and was beginning to practiseit; and that this was especially true in the economic field, in regard to industrialdevelopment and in the field of capital investment. He had not found the PrimeMinister too explicit about the future role he envisaged for the pound sterling,though Mr. Wilson had expressed full confidence in the strength of sterling. Francepaid tribute to the great effort made by the British Government to restore thenation&apos;s economic strength during the past two years. But they were not clearabout the British attitude in the financial field. British policy towards sterlingstill seemed to be very closely linked with United States financial policy.Nevertheless he wished to re-emphasise the great difference that struck him in thePrime Ministers remarks about Britain&apos;s attitude towards her own independence;and he warmly welcomed this.Expansion of the CommunityGeneral de Gaulle said that during the years since the concept of european unity had been developed, and particularly since the signature of the Rome Treaty,certain realities, as the&quot; Prime Minister would know, had been created. The Treatyitself was not such a reality-it was simply a Treaty. But its application had created certain realities, difficult as that application had been, both in the industrial and economic field and also-and here the difficulties had been very great indeed-in agriculture. But the consequence of this was that a method of working had developed between the six partners in the Common Market which took accountof their different economic interests and sought to achieve a process of mutualcompensation in respect of those interests. This was a very slow process; it wasnot yet finished and might never be finished. But the machinery had begun to work.Of course this was the situation as it had developed at present amongst the six and without taking account of the possibility of British entry.  Such entry was
clearly a matter of major significance, both economically and industrially; itsconsequence would be profoundly to change, if not the text of the Treaty, certainlyits practical application as indeed the Prime Minister had himself recognisedMoreover, if Britain joined the e.c. then clearly others would wish to do the sameparticularly members of EFTA. In consequence, it would no longer be a community of six countries but of anything between seven and 13; and its wholenature would be quite different. Naturally, the Prime Minister realised this andhe (General de Gaulle) was not suggesting that it was an inconceivable proposition&apos;indeed he did not regard it as such. But it would be very difficult.General de Gaulle said that this disposed of the problems that british membership would pose for the machinery and the operation of the e.c.. But inaddition there were a number of practical problems. It was difficult fully to definethese at present and would in any case take too much time. Clearly agriculturewas one; and coal and steel would be others, since the Community wished tocontrol these too. But perhaps the most important of all would be the financial problem and the problem of currencies. It was undeniable that these were commonproblems, and that the difficulties of sterling had an impact on the currencies ofall European countries. They all hoped that sterling was becoming stronger andwelcomed the Prime Ministers statement to that effect. But it could not be denied that sterling was in a different international position from the other Europeancurrencies in that it was a reserve currency and, because of the vast size of the sterling balances, presented certain very special difficulties which placed it in adifferent situation from the currencies of the Six. This was a serious problem; andthere were others as well.General de Gaulle said that the Prime Minister had explained Britishintentions. He had listened with the utmost consideration and respect. france had no doubt of the great economic and technological capacity of Britain; and it seemed clear that, whether or not Britain joined the Common Market, France and Britain could do much useful work together in a number of fields. The PrimeMinister had referred to aircraft: there was also co-operation in the field of space-Britain and France were co-operating with Germany and Italy to produce a spacerocket which they hoped would be of considerable value in the future. they recognised that Britain was extremely advanced in the computer field; and in this and in other fields there was great scope for co-operation between France and Britain and also between the two of them and Germany and Italy.In regard to East I West relations, General de Gaulle agreed that the Frenchand British approaches were very similar and that they were in effect working in parallel though he hoped that he might be allowed to say that France had playedthe hand rather more independently of the United States, for example, in regard tosuch problems as Vietnam, than Britain had seen fit to do. But there was no real disagreement between them on the East/West problem, a subject of capitalimportance. However, whether or not they achieved economic unity withinWestern Europe, nothing could be expected to come of this unless they could achieve the complete unity of Europe and the total independence that he soughtfrom the United States. He wished to make it clear that, in speaking in this way ofthe United States, he did not do so in any spirit of hostility or animosity towardsthe Americans. But Europe could only achieve something effective in the world ifthe European countries were completely independent themselves.General de Gaulle said that he would reflect very carefully over what thePrime Minister had said, over what he had heard about Mr. Wilson&apos;s andMr. Brown&apos;s talks in Rome and the account of those that the French Governmenthad received from the British Government-and he would look forward to hearingfrom the Prime Minister in due course how his talks in the other capitals of the six had gone. The French Government would then wish to reflect very carefullyon the outcome and to weigh the various considerations involved.Defence questions the Prime Minister thanked the General and suggested that he shouldcomment on some of the main issues raised. On certain of them, he thought thatcomplete understanding could be reached; on others there were perhaps at presentsome misunderstandings which he would try to dispel. General de Gaulle had referred to the difference in the British attitude three to four years ago and that
which now prevailed. He himself had not of course been involved in the previousdiscussions but he had the clear impression that the Nassau Agreement perhapsjess because of its content than as a symbol had had a serious effect onAnelo-French relations. The Foreign Secretary and he had then been in Oppositionancfhad attacked and voted against the Nassau Agreement; and they had declared their intention to re-negotiate or &quot; de-negotiate&quot; it on coming to power. Inpractice, so far as Nassau was concerned, within a month of coming to power theyhad killed the MLF project which had appeared at that time the main object ofUnited States policy in NATO; the multilateral fleet had been torpedoed by aBritish finger pressing the switch. We had then put forward our proposal for an atlantic Nuclear Force. But increasingly from that time onwards we had beenseeking a solution within NATO, but equally of a nature that would not imperil the prospects of understanding with the East. The British Government had consistently worked for an agreement on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.It was neither a secret nor a surprise for him to say that there were big differences between France and Britain in their approach to NATO, just as there were between france and some of her partners in the Six on the same subject. General de Gaulleagreed.But the Prime Minister said that we should examine more closely this argumentabout defence and the nuclear force. It was true that, because of the NassauAgreement, British nuclear forces took the form of Polaris submarines. His party had criticised that Agreement. But the Agreement existed and it had been impossible to put the clock back and start again, for example with a Blue Streakmissile. What mattered was that once we had the Polaris missiles, as we should do shortly, they would belong to us and there would be no question of dependence on the United States for this particular form of nuclear power. The French position was similar. They had bought aircraft from the United States for refuelling theForce de Frappe: but once these had been acquired they belonged to France.Now, however, a further defence question arose in relation to the purchase ofmilitary aircraft. As he himself had told General de Gaulle two years ago and before it had been announced publicly in Britain, the Labour Government hadinherited from their predecessors and this was not a critical comment but afactual one an aircraft that would have been exceptionally costly and wouldnot have been ready in time to meet the needs of the RAF. When they had been obliged to cancel if, the only plane adequate to fulfil British needs was the F-lll,and this we should be using in the late 60s and early 70s. But he would ask theGeneral to note the difference in their current planning situation. The majoraircraft for the RAF for the middle and late 70s would now be the Anglo-Frenchplane.  General de Gaulle assented.The Prime Minister said that the principle here was of sharing the cost anddoubling the market. But the implications went even deeper. By entering this project Britain and France were effectively integrating their aircraft industries.This would be particularly so in the case of aero engines. Shortly we should bejointly producing the most advanced aero engine in &quot;the world and the rolls-Royce SNECMA combination could hope to force Pratt and Whitney outof the European market. General de Gaulle agreed. The Prime Minister saidthat this did, as the General said, make sense whether or not Britain was in theCommon Market: it was a useful bilateral development. But what a differentsituation it reflected from the days when the Nassau Agreement and all itsymbolised had been said to poison Anglo-French relations. We could now hope for a greater development of joint arms production leading in due course to a process of Anglo-French co-operation which could make the two countries intothe arsenal of Europe.General de Gaulle said that all this was very true and he recalled his last conversation with the Prime Minister. Anglo-French co-operation was undoubtedly important; but it could be effective irrespective of British membership of the Common Market. The Prime Minister said that what they had been sayingwas indeed of historic importance and effectively turned the Nassau agreement on its head But it should not be forgotten that, in the field of civil production over a wide range of technological industries (e.g., computers), effective and competitive production required not only integration of production and designbut also integration of the market. We could not possibly develop effective co-operation with a continuation of high tariffs between the two countries (general de Gaulle made sceptical motions of the head).
SterlingReverting to the question of sterling, the Prime Minister recalled his talksduring his last visit with Messieurs Pompidou, Couve de Murville and RueffBritain and France did not agree on all these questions but many of the so-calledproblems of sterling disappeared now that Britain was moving into balance ofpayments surplus; and some of the other problems of sterling were rather different from the way General de Gaulle appeared to conceive them.As regards the sterling balances the Prime Minister said he would like todiscuss this very fully with France and her partners in the Six; he wondered ifa European solution could be found to the problem. The sterling balances werein no way linked to the dollar. There seemed no reason why the problems arising,out of them could not be solved on a European basis; if we brought into sucha settlement the debts involved, we should not forget that we equally had enormousassets within the sterling area including large investments in the United States.Most of our sterling balances in a sense represented a banker&apos;s debt to sterlingdepositors which could not be drawn on because they represented a reserve forcurrencies or covered a matching debt to us. But for every pound sterling of debt, we held counter-balancing assets throughout the world. There was therefore no danger whatever to Europe of a run on the sterling balances, because we hadthe capital to offset it. But while Her Majesty&apos;s Government took a differentview from the French Government on the liquidity question or the gold problem,he believed that there was room for much greater financial co-operation withinEurope. He wished to emphasise the word &quot; co-operation &quot; he did not believethat in the foreseeable future a single European currency would emerge or thatthere would be a supra-national authority telling us all what to do in financial matters. However, the European Payments Union (EPU) had been of considerablevalue until it was in effect destroyed by the huge German surplus. Again, heand his colleagues did not feel that the well-known differences between Franceand Britain on monetary and sterling affairs were any fatal obstacle to british membership of the Common Market because equally deep differences dividedFrance and her other partners in the Common Market. Finally, he much agreed with what General de Gaulle had said about industrial co-operation and independence; and the British approach to this certainly involved no form ofanimosity towards the United States. The plain fact was that without industrialindependence there could be no real independence for the countries of Europe.East/West relations.   AfricaTurning to East I West relations, the Prime Minister said that the expressionused by General de Gaulle was exactly right our policies were &quot; parallel&quot; in the sense that we were moving in the same direction but on a different track;a track that he considered appropriate to the contribution each of the two countries could make to this problem. He thought this was equally true in regard to another important area, namely Africa. Here too, British and French policies were working in parallel and both countries had important contributions to make, though itwas no doubt preferable that they should not seek to compete too much with eachother in individual African countries. Both had created a number of independent countries; both still retained substantial influence in Africa and there was a good prospect of co-operation in the development of the area.In reply to a question from the Prime Minister the Foreign Secretary said thathe did not wish to add anything at that stage; and M. Couve de Murville equallyresponded negatively when asked by General de Gaulle whether he wished to comment.General de Gaulle said that he was extremely interested in what the PrimeMinister had said. It was true that British and French policies were in parallelin the field of East/West relations and equally in Africa where they were no longer in opposition to each other.Anglo-French co-operation the two countries were equally now involved in a number of joint industrialprojects Concord, the eventual development of the variable geometry aircraft and the current development of the Jaguar; and in the European launcher development Organisation (ELDO) they were co-operating also with other
countries. On the whole, France found herself far less engaged in bilateralco-operation of the Anglo-French kind with such other European countries as germany and Italy, even though the latter were members with her of the common market. It was clear that membership or otherwise of e.c. was irrelevant tothe development of this kind of co-operation. The Foreign Secretary said that itmight be irrelevant but that was certainly not an argument against British entry.General de Gaulle assented. The Prime Minister said that, whereas in the field of military co-operation the impulse and the orders were given by governments,in civilian technology co-operative projects could be encouraged by governmentsbut could not be imposed by them; and the firms involved were bound to runinto substantial difficulties unless the two countries were members of the samemarket. Where Britain and France were jointly developing a military aircraft,we could be confident that both countries would buy it. But if we entered a jointdevelopment project, for example in the field of computers, where Britain hadsomething to offer to France, or equally in the field of chemical engineering whereBritain might gain from more advanced French expertise, the successfuldevelopment of such projects required a guaranteed market for the eventualproduct. But if we tried to sell the British product of a joint computer project inthe French market, we should face there the same tariffs as our Americancompetitors; equally the product of a joint scientific project which might be primarily of benefit to France would face competition in the British market becausethe tariffs would be the same as those levied against the United States. Really close co-operation in the field of civil technology was impossible without an integratedmarket.conclusion the Prime Minister said that he was grateful to General de Gaulle for thecourtesy and patience with which he had heard the statement of the British position.It had seemed useful to develop this in depth and at some length. The foreign secretary and he noted that the General would wish to study all the issues involvedafter their visits to all Six capitals had been completed. They looked forward to a discussion that afternoon with some of his Ministers at which they might be ableto go in greater detail into some of the more technical questions involved inBritish membership.The meeting ended at 11.50 a.m.MINUTES OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND THEFOREIGN SECRETARY AND THE FRENCH PRIME MINISTER ANDFRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER AT THE HOTEL MATIGNON,PARIS, ON 24th JANUARY, 1967, AT 3.30 p.m.   ,Present:The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, m pThe Right Hon. George Brown, m pHE Sir Patrick ReillySir Burke trend . W. A. NieldSir Con 0&apos;neill mr. A. M. PalliserM. Georges PompidouM. Maurice Couve de MurvilleM. Geoffroy de CourcelM. JobertM. MontjoieM. GaucherM. BrunetM. La veryM. Andronikov (Interpreter)Opening remarksM. Pompidou extended a warm welcome to the Prime Minister, the foreign secretary and their colleagues. He suggested that the meeting should proceedstraight to business and should discuss in detail some of the more important aspectsof British entry into the e.c.. .
The Prime Minister thanked M. Pompidou for the welcome which the FrenchGovernment had extended to himself and his colleagues. In his discussions withGeneral de Gaulle in the morning he had attempted to deal with the main points,both political and economic, arising from the fresh British approach to the e.c.;and he had tried to relate this approach to the wider question of the part which an enlarged Community might play in world affairs, with particular reference tothe contribution which Britain and France, acting in parallel, could make not onlyto easing tension within Europe itself but also to making Europe a force in its own right in the wider international context.M. Couve de Murville observed that the morning&apos;s discussion had been in very general terms. It had been essentially a political discussion, in the broadestsense of that term. Now it would be profitable to try to consider in greater detail the financial, monetary and agricultural problems which would arise from british entry to the e.c..United Kingdom economic situation.   SterlingThe Prime Minister said that it was essential to define the nature of thefinancial and economic problem which was in question. In so far as it related to the strength of the British economy a great change had taken place since his first visit to Paris. At that time Britain had faced a deficit of  800 million on her balance of payments; now she was in prospective surplus. Similarly, the deficit on the balance of visible trade had fallen from a monthly average of  45 million in 1964 to  23 million in 1965 and had fallen again to  12 million in 1966. Therewas therefore no longer any question of sterling^ being in danger or of our being unable to maintain the parity of the pound. As he saw it, then, the problem a tissue was essentially a problem not of the strength or parity of sterling but of the threat which, it was commonly assumed, the sterling balances and the link betweensterling and the dollar would create for the Community if Britain joined it. Wasthat the right way of defining the issue?M. Pompidou replied that the question had two aspects. First, did theprospect for the British balance of payments, as the Prime Minister saw it, reallyjustify his assumption that the problems of the British economy could be regardedas finally overcome? And, if so, what reasons had Britain for believing this to bethe case? Second, there was the question of sterling balances and the variousclaims which still pressed on sterling particularly Britain&apos;s indebtedness to theIMF and the balance of payments problems of the sterling area as a whole.The Prime Minister said that the answer to the first question was clear, giventhe improvement in the British balance of payments from 1964 to 1966 which hehad just described. As regards the longer term future it was important to realise that ever since they had assumed office in October 1964 the British Governmenthad put the balance of payments first, before all other economic and socialobjectives; and, although they might feel able to &quot;ease the current economicrestrictions as time went on, they had no intention of carrying this process to thepoint at which the balance of payments would once more be in danger. one had to remember also that some of the measures which they had taken in Julyhad not yet made their full impact on the balance of payments, while the technological reorganisation of industry which the Government were activelyundertaking would take still longer to bear fruit.Then there were our debts, especially to the IMF. They amounted to between 900 and  1,000 million sterling, in two tranches. This year&apos;s repayment wouldbe met without difficulty ever since last August we had been paying backshort term debt. As for the tranche due in 1970, there was no reason to see anyspecial difficulty. These debts to the IMF were gold-guaranteed; this was an extrareason for our not being enthusiastic about raising the price of gold, which inany case was not really a practical possibility.As regards the sterling balances, these were admittedly liabilities in the bankingsense. They had been contracted during the war and they had remained at much the same total level ever since. Their composition, however, had changed fromtime to time-e.g., at the end of the war Egypt and India had been very largeholders of sterling balances, whereas now their holdings were minimal. On theother hand as our investment overseas had grown so the balances had risen pan
nossu. Variations in commodity prices e.g., Australian wool and Ghana cocoa could also affect them considerably. But a large part of them consisted of the currency reserves of other countries, which those countries would have no incentive to run down unless they ran into very serious currency difficulties indeed. Thiswas one of the reasons for the stability of the balances even when sterling was weak.Another element represented provision against maturing debt; and this elementalso was a factor making for stability in the balances, especially as the relevantredemption dates approached.In a rather separate category were the working balances of the many categories of traders who financed their operations through the London market the largeinternational companies, especially the oil companies, who financed their royaltypayments in sterling. The same was true of the international banks. It was theseworking balances which were liable to fall under the pressure of speculation ashad probably happened in the previous July. The holdings of the national central banks, on the other hand, were more closely regulated by co-operative arrangementssuch as the recent Basle Agreement, so as to neutralise speculative movements. in short, though the balances were large in total, they contained many mutuallyoffsetting factors and the volatile element in the total of the balances was relativelyvery small.Moreover, the assets which were held against the balances, in the form of ourinvestments overseas (which we should have mobilised if pressure on the pound had become more severe), were larger than the balances themselves. So faras we were concerned, sterling was not an instrument of prestige in any sense.As a banker M. Pompidou would realise that obligations did not confer prestige!On the other hand they had to be covered by assets; and ours were so covered.If we entered the e.c. we would be ready to share these obligations (and the prestige which they were alleged to confer) with its other members. But whatwas it that they really feared? Did they fear that, if new pressures against sterlingdeveloped subsequently, Europe would then be forced into deflation in order toprotect sterling? But, if Europe were to share these prestigious obligations theywould need to share also the assets which backed them. The important thingwas that the assets exceeded the obligations in question. There could thereforebe no question of sterling^ being a drag on Europe; nor did we seek any special position for ourselves in the Community by virtue of having these sterlingobligations. We would therefore be quite ready to discuss M. Debre&apos;s proposalsfor funding them, although there were certain difficulties in this suggestion.The commercial sterling balances which derived from the simple fact that many traders all over the world had the habit of settling their debts in sterling were a rather different matter. To some extent they were a function of the availability of capital markets and the facilities which those markets provided.One of the problems which had emerged since the war was the fact that the dollarhad developed as a trading currency without having a really adequate capitalmarket to sustain it. To some extent the same was true of the Deutschmark inrelation to Frankfurt. We welcomed the French intention to develop aninternational capital market in Paris; but the French authorities would recognise, ofcourse, that, in so far as they succeeded, the franc would be exposed to new strainsand dangers. On balance, however, France could only gain. She had developednew techniques in the management of capital, particularly as regards financing therequirements of the Commissariat du Plan; and we could learn from her. In factwe should like to co-operate with France in this field; and our own experience of managing a major international capital market would be freely contributed. Butit was essential to realise that the vulnerability of any currency which was used as a means of international payment depended, basically, on the balance of payments ofthe country concerned. We had learned this lesson. So would the French. But on balance they should benefit the more their currency was, as it were, &quot; extroverted &quot;.The Prime Minister repeated that, if Britain entered the e.c., she would seekno privileged position for sterling. We stood ready to discuss in more detail thePossibility of internationalising the sterling balances as one aspect of the widerquestion of the extent to which the e.c. might develop, as a Community, adistinctive monetary policy of its own. This did not mean that we foresaw any immediate prospect of creating an institutionalised European monetary policy,
which would be binding on all member countries. This would imply acorresponding institutionalisation of their budgetary policies; and it was unlikelythat they would be prepared to surrender to this extent the right to manage theirown economies. On the other hand there was plenty of scope for greater co-operation, e.g., in relation to the concept of a European Payments Union, which as originally conceived, had had much to be said for it. It might be desirable to resumestudy of a European Payments Union if only in order to reduce the extent to whichintra-European payments were now settled in dollars. This was something whichwe would be very willing to discuss bilaterally with the French authorities-preferably, perhaps, by contacts between the two central banks if the negotiationsfor our entry to the e.c. got under way.In short, there was no question in our minds of seeking to maintain someunique prestige for sterling; and we had no thought of seeking any special position for Britain or for sterling within the Community. Nor did we see any necessaryconnection between the part which sterling might play in the Community and theinternational role of the dollar. Sterling and the dollar were not linked to-day;and there would be still less need for any link between them in the circumstances which he had tried to describe. Indeed, so far as Britain and France were ableto work together, the stronger sterling became the more problems the dollar wouldbe liable to encounter. But that was inevitable.M. Pompidou thanked the Prime Minister for his detailed exposition. TheFrench Government had been very conscious of the political difficulties which theBritish Government had faced when they had taken their measures of the previousJuly to restore the British economy. They congratulated the British Prime minister on the courage which had made those measures possible; and they were themore pleased to hear about the favourable prospects for the United kingdom balance of payments in that they had always opposed a devaluation of sterling,which would have&apos;been of no benefit to Britain and would probably have damagedFrance also.He also wished to make it clear that French monetary policy even if it wasnot endorsed by Britain in every respect did not require an alteration in the priceof gold. What it did require was a recognition that the international monetary system was at present working unfairly. It was therefore essential to try tore-establish one common standard of payment for all countries; and this shouldobviously be gold. As a result some countries might face problems which couldonly be solved by an increase in the price of gold; but the increase itself wouldbe only a subsidiary and consequential aspect of the problem.He had been greatly struck by the emphasis which the Prime Minister had placed on the world role played by sterling at the centre of a system of international trade and capital finance. It was clear that, as a result, Britain was invloved in heavy extra-European commitments. He could understand very well that inthese circumstances Britain was only too ready to share the so-called prestige of sterling. For their part the French Government were certainly anxious to developParis as an international capital market. But they proposed to proceed verycautiously, since they were well aware that, despite the &quot; prestige &quot; which theymight acquire, the disadvantages might prove to be greater than the advantages inthe long run. Notwithstanding the predominance of the dollar, Britain still carrieda great weight of inheritance from the past, which inevitably coloured her imagein the eyes of the rest of the world. The French Government were well aware ofthis and of what it meant.As regards Britain&apos;s entry into the e.c., it had to be recognised that the member &quot;countries had now created within the Community a highly complexmachine, which determined their individual policies to a considerable extent andmight well be unacceptable to Britain. Thus, the Common Agricultural Policy had certain clear implications as regards the monetary and budgetary policies of the member countries. This might not be a very attractive prospect for the UnitedKingdom; but it was so. The result was a certain solidarity among the currenciesof the Six; and they would therefore have to consider very carefully the probableresult if the United Kingdom and sterling were injected into the system. among other things they would welcome some clarification of the British views on the free movement of capital.
M. Couve de Murville said that here, as elsewhere, one must begin with theTreaty of Rome. This entailed, indeed prescribed, freedom of payments, bothcommercial and other, within the Community, together with free movement ofcapital. On the other hand it also made provision for certain mutual guarantees of temporary assistance if member countries encountered difficulties on theirexternal payments. In fact, the member countries had no external commitments of the kind, and on the scale, -which Britain carried with the possible but trivial,exception of the link between the French franc and the currency of certain african countries. By contrast the financial implications of Britain&apos;s entry into theCommunity could be very serious indeed, given the international character of sterling and the extent of the sterling area. In these circumstances what would bethe commitments which Britain would have to undertake to her partners in the eec, if she entered it; and what would be the commitments which they wouldhave to undertake to her? The recent troubles on the British balance of payments were a British affair and could be left out of account. But there would still remain,if Britain entered the Community, the problem of the nature of the sterling area and the engagements it entailed. There was the problem of the sterling balances,whether they were currency reserves or the working balances of traders. Thelatter were less important, since they were completely free, were constantlychanging and therefore adjusted themselves more or less automatically to theneeds of the situation at any given time. But the sterling reserves were a more permanent problem; and they were a political problem as well.These questions were practical problems, which had nothing to do withsterling^ alleged prestige or its link with the dollar, which, despite the necessaryinteraction between those two currencies from time to time, had no particularrelevance to the e.c.. Nobody in the Community wanted to share the prestige of sterling; but they were all concerned about the commitments which sterlingcarried with it. That was what would have to be considered very carefully.The Prime Minister said that he welcomed M. Pompidou&apos;s realistic remarksabout sterling devaluation. Sterling was not an over-valued currency, as the franchad been some 10 years ago. Our recent export record alone sufficed to provethis, since it was clear that, although our exports were still handicapped to someextent by long delivery dates and lack of capacity (both of which we were urgentlyremedying), they were not impeded by uncompetitive prices. M. Pompidou would realise, of course, that, if Britain sought an easy way out of her difficulties bydevaluing sterling, other countries would follow and this would touch off the familiar sequence of events leading to a contraction of world trade from whicheverybody would suffer.He had also noted M. Pompidou&apos;s remarks about gold. The european payments Union had in fact involved settlements in gold; and this would be oneof the things which would have to be considered if we were to embark on anyre-examination of the EPU concept. But nobody should be under any illusionthat, if the United States moved into surplus, European problems would be eased;on the contrary, they would be aggravated by the Euro-dollar squeeze which wouldthen develop.As regards the obligations which were represented by the sterling balances,he noted the French reluctance to share sterling^ prestige in this context.Nevertheless, we should remain ready to discuss the problem which these balanceswere said to create and we would be very ready to examine any means of preventing the balances from becoming a drag on Europe, if we entered theCommunity. It would not greatly matter whether we found the solution by leaving the balances outside the e.c. and dealing with them ourselves as a wholly separateproblem or by funding them within the Community against the assets, which wouldsimilarly be brought within the Community&apos;s scope. The main point was that the assets exceeded the liabilities.Capital movements the main financial problems of Britain&apos;s entry into the Community, therefore,were not the questions of sterling and the sterling balances but the problems ofagricultural finance and capital movements. Even these, however, could be solved.As regards capital movements both the Treaty of Rome and the practice of theCommunity itself distinguished between direct investment and portfolio investment.
It was in the latter case that a problem arose for us m so far as, it we relaxed ourexchange control to permit the movement of capital within an enlarged Community,some means would have to be found to prevent it from leaking, via the Community,to eg the United States. It was one thing for us to help Europe to find capital for the under-developed countries; it was a very different thing for us to helpEurope to find capital for the United States.The question of agriculture could perhaps be pursued on the following day.RECORD OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER ANDFOREIGN SECRETARY AND THE FRENCH PRIME MINISTERAND THE FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER AT THE HOTELMATIGNON, PARIS, ON WEDNESDAY, 25th JANUARY, 1967, at p.m.Present:The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, m p	M.	PompidouThe Right Hon. George Brown, m p	M.	Couve de MurvilleSir Burke Trend	M.	de CourcelSir Con 0&apos;Neill	M.	J. P. BrunetMr. W. A. Nield	M.	AlphandMr. A. M. Palliser		M. Andronikov (Interpreter)M. Pompidou said it had been agreed the previous day that there should be a discussion of the agricultural problems in the first part of the afternoon and thatthe two sides should then adjourn to the Elysee Palace for a final meeting withGeneral de Gaulle.Other problems of United Kingdom entryThe Foreign Secretary said that before turning to the problems of agriculturehe would like to mention certain other problems which, though less serious, would need to be considered at a later stage. The first of these concerned the provisionof aid to the less-developed economic regions. France had a similar problem toours, but our methods of dealing with it were rather different, and it would benecessary to discuss later how far we could continue to use our present methods.Then there were certain agricultural problems not arising directly from the common agricultural Policy itself which would have to be resolved, but should not constitute a barrier to British membership of the Community. Third, there was the questionof the timetable which we should follow in introducing the common external tariffand in abolishing our tariffs against other members of the Community. Here again,the problem would need to be considered later, but it did not warrant consideration on that very day. Fourth, he felt he should make clear that the United Kingdomdid not see the initiative we were taking towards the Community as an alternative to achievement of success for the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations. we considered success in that venture to be essential whether we joined the community or not, and in one respect, namely the negotiation of a new International CerealsAgreement, the success of the Kennedy Round might make it easier for the UnitedKingdom to join the Community.Common Agricultural PolicyTurning to the problem of agriculture, the Foreign Secretary said that, as withthe Treaty of Rome, the Common Agricultural Policy was not in itself necessarilyan impediment to our membership, and the comments he would be making shouldnot therefore be construed as a rejection of the system itself. Adapting our agricultural system to that of the Community would indeed raise problems for us,bue we should be prepared to fit in with the Community system if we were assistedto meet the four main difficulties it raised for us.
The first, and in a way the least serious, of these difficulties was the effect whichthe Common Agricultural Policy would have on the cost of living and so on theorices and incomes stabilisation policy of the United Kingdom. Adjustment ofour present internal prices to those of the Community would raise the cost of food in the United Kingdom by between 10 and 14 per cent, and the period over whichthis had to be done was therefore very important, especially as a significant numberof our wage and salary agreements were statistically related to the cost-of-living index. Provided, however, a sufficient transitional period was allowed, this difficultydid not constitute a barrier to our entry, and especially so if Community prices didnot remain at their present high level.Our second difficulty arose out of the distorting effect which the present price levels of the Common Agricultural Policy would have on our own domesticagriculture. Whilst the income of our farming community as a whole wouldprobably be at least as high on Community prices as on our present prices, thebalance of our agriculture would be significantly distorted. The high Communitycereals prices would, in broad terms, benefit the larger farmers east of a line drawnnorth to south down the United Kingdom. In the wetter areas to the west of this line our smaller livestock farmers currently concentrating upon the production of milk, pigs and eggs would have a strong incentive to increase their cereal production,not only because of the relatively high prices for cereals, but also because they atpresent depended on feedingstuffs bought at the lower world market prices of theUnited Kingdom. Again, this was not an insuperable difficulty, but if by 1969 or1970 the Community&apos;s prices remained as high as they were now, we should need a considerable transitional period for our farmers to adjust to the new structure of prices, and it would also be necessary that grants for structural change in ouragriculture should be accepted and assisted within the Common Agricultural Policy.It seemed to us that the Community&apos;s Guidance and Guarantee Fund could be usedfor this purpose, especially (as he would make clear later) as we should be a majorcontributor to this Fund. We were not, therefore, asking for assistance at theexpense of others, but only that we should be allowed to use some of the funds we ourselves should be contributing, to facilitate the necessary structural adjustments in British agriculture.The third of the problems with which acceptance of the Common agricultural policy would face us was its effect on Commonwealth trade with the UnitedKingdom. We had considered this problem carefully as it was to-day, as againstwhat it was in the 1961-63 negotiations. As the Community knew from those negotiations, the application of the Common Agricultural Policy would createspecial problems for our trade with Australia and Canada, and also for our tradewith other countries, and for the future of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.All these problems would have to be resolved when making arrangements for theUnited Kingdom to join the Community. But much the most difficult problem inthis field was undoubtedly that of New Zealand&apos;s trade with the United Kingdom,and it seemed unlikely that a transitional period would be adequate in this case.Whilst we accepted the necessity of keeping derogations from the Treaty to aminimum, it seemed that a derogation would be necessary to give New Zealandreasonable access to the market on which she was so dependent, and to enable her to live in the new circumstances which British entry to the Community would create. He would emphasise what had been said earlier in the discussions &quot; soyezgentille a la Nouvelle Zelande &quot;.The fourth and most formidable of the problems with which the common agricultural Policy confronted us, however, concerned the additional burden which would be placed on our balance of payments if Community prices remained at their present levels and if the financial arrangements for the common agricultural Policy remained unchanged after our entry. It was not merely that theburden would be so great, but that our contribution to the levy payments, if wehad to surrender 90 per cent of the levies, would be so high as to be quite inequitable.This situation would arise because we imported half as much again in terms ofleviable food and feedingstuffs as did Germany, at present by far the largest foodimporter in the Community, and more than twice as much in leviable imports from outside the Community. We should, therefore, if no adjustments were made, bepaying in levies more than twice as much as Germany and getting on for as much as the rest of the Community put together. But, because our agricultural
industry was relatively efficient in its structure and cost levels, we should have lessoccasion to call on the Guidance and Guarantee Fund for financial assistance for ourselves.He was not challenging in these observations the structure and form of theCommon Agricultural Policy but pointing out that, if it was decided that theUnited Kingdom should become a member of the Community, it would benecessary to discuss pricing and financial arrangements which would make thefinancial burden which the Common Agricultural Policy would impose on us lessonerous and less inequitable. As a new member bringing considerable advantages to the Community we were entitled to ask for such adjustments to be made onaccession, as the other members had done. On that basis, and given goodwill, hewas sure our problems could be solved.The Prime Minister said he would like to point out as a supplement to what mr. Brown had said that the Community&apos;s cereals prices were high by both Frenchand United Kingdom standards. Their adoption by us would give a great incentive to our farmers to turn over from livestock to cereals production, for whichespecially in the West we were not climatically suited. A lower Community cerealsprice would avoid this distortion of our production patterns and afford more scope for exports of French cereals to the United Kingdom.M. Couve de Murville asked what would be our estimate of the effect of community prices on the volume of production of cereals in the United Kingdom?The Foreign Secretary in reply said that we estimated that our current productionof some 13 million tons per annum would increase in about five years to over20 million tons, mainly wheat and barley. Beef production might also be encouraged by higher Community prices, but that of milk, pigs, and eggs would be discouraged by higher feed prices hence the distorting effect of Community prices to which he had referred.M. Pompidou said he would like to make some general points arising out ofMr. Brown&apos;s clear exposition of the difficulties which the Common agricultural policy raised for the United Kingdom. First he was bound to say that thosedifficulties were not secondary ones, but went to the heart of the common agricultural Policy and concerned precisely those points on which it has been most difficult to reach agreement between the Six partners in the Common Market.France would have liked to see a lower and more competitive Community pricefixed for those products like cereals and sugar for the production of which hersoil and climate were most favourable. But it had been necessary to constructthe Common Agricultural Policy on a basis which would enable the community to become self-sufficient, and to impose penalties on imports of food from outsidethe Community. Hence the high prices and the system of protecting the leastcompetitive elements in the Community. The farmers&apos; organisations of the six countries were now so united that any general reduction of Community price levelscould be considered unrealistic; indeed at present there were strong demands from them for the attainment of the final price level to be brought forward in time.While noting what Mr. Brown had said about the United Kingdom&apos;s difficultiesnot being insuperable, he was bound to point out that it was precisely the three points he had mentioned, i.e., imports from third countries (e.g., from theCommonwealth), the level of prices, and the financial regulations, on which theCommunity had found it most difficult to reach agreement. If these issues werereopened, major problems would arise for the Six. To say this was merely to analyse the facts he would not dispute that the Common Agricultural Policy wasnot in economic terms a sound policy.M. Couve de Murville said that he wished to make two points about what mr. Brown had said. First, the world supply and price situation was very different from what it was when the prices of the Common Agricultural Policy had been fixed; the big agricultural surpluses of the post-war period were now disappearingand prices generally could be expected to be higher. Second, the Community wasone of agricultural protectionists and if the United Kingdom were to join, it wouldnot change character, but the economy of the United Kingdom would develop on different lines from those of the last 100 years. Agricultural production would develop to an important extent, the United Kingdom might even find herself anexporter of cereals, and her imports of food would fall.  He therefore felt that
the estimates of the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy to the United kingdom might be excessive and that the higher price levels of the Community might inthe end pay for the developments he had indicated.The Prime Minister, in conclusion, said that the discussion had been a useful01ie and had brought out in particular the need for the financial regulations to be reviewed if the United Kingdom joined the Community as a new member,Those present then adjourned to the Elysee for the final meeting there.RECORD OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTERAND THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF france at THE ELYSEE PALACE IN PARIS ON WEDNESDAY,25th JANUARY, 1967, AT 4.15 p.m.Present:The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, m p    General de GaulleMr. A. M. Palliser M. PompidouM. Andronikov (Interpreter)Common Agricultural PolicyGeneral de Gaulle said that he hoped the Prime Minister was satisfied withthe talks he and Mr. Brown had had in Paris. The Prime Minister said thatthe talks had been most useful. He had just come from an interesting exchangeof views with M. Pompidou about agriculture. He thought that during the two days of meetings all the arguments and the problems involved had been broadlycovered. General de Gaulle said that he had seen an account of discussions theprevious day of the problems of the sterling area. He asked how the discussion on agriculture had gone. The Prime Minister said that Mr. Brown had fully explained our position and that we would of course be having further exchangesabout this with other members of the e.c.. One of the main points of difficulty was the question of the financial arrangements. They had also discussed thepossible effect on the British position of the price structure under.the common agricultural Policy and likely future developments in the field of price levels.General de Gaulle said he assumed they had also discussed the system oflevies.The Prime Minister said that, as they had told French Ministers that afternoon,the difficulties for Britain under the Common Agricultural Policy included not only those of the financial levies themselves but the whole complex of the financial arrangements. It was clear that if Britain were to join the Common Marketthere would have to be changes in these arrangements, as would in any event be necessary on the entry of a new member particularly a major food importersuch as Britain. Unless such changes were made, the burden of payments thatwould fall on Britain would be both inequitable and also excessive in relationto the requirements of the Community&apos;s agricultural fund itself.CommonwealthGeneral de Gaulle said that he assumed that Britain&apos;s obligations to theCommonwealth would also be affected. The Prime Minister said that these problems were largely subsumed under the general heading of agriculture. TheFrench Ministers shared with himself and the Foreign Secretary the recognition that world food prices and particularly cereal prices were likely to rise overthe next few years, especially if (as seemed probable) China continued to be atarge importer of grain and American surpluses diminished. To that extent theproblems presented by the Community&apos;s price levels might not be as great as hadbeen thought.
Common Agricultural Policy CerealsThe Prime Minister said that, in general, he had found the talks useful and constructive. He wished the General to know how much he and the foreign secretary appreciated the time and attention which General de Gaulle and his ministers had devoted to them. General de Gaulle said that M. Pompidou had told him of something that had greatly surprised and impressed him; namely,the large amount of cereals produced in Britain. He had never realised that weproduced as much as 13 million tons a year; and he repeated how surprised hehad been by this. The Prime Minister said that we produced 13 million tonsand imported about 7 million tons of cereals. Our present estimate was that,if we succeeded in joining the Common Market, if the Common Market price levels remained unchanged over the next few years and if world price levelsrose in roughly the way we expected, we should soon be producing about20 million tons of cereals and importing a further 3-4 million tons. general de Gaulle assented; these were the figures that had been mentioned to him. ThePrime Minister said that we were nevertheless not satisfied that such a development would make economic sense for Britain; it was arguable that, inthe longer term, it would be preferable for us to import a larger proportion ofour cereals from France and ourselves to concentrate more on livestockproduction. But all these calculations and the consequences to be drawn from them would depend on internal studies being made about the likely consequenceof the Common Agricultural Policy for the member countries and also on whateveradjustments might be made in Common Market prices when the financial arrangements came up for discussion again in 1969. In general, however, hethought that it would make good economic sense both for France and Britain,and for Europe as a whole, if the level of cereal prices were to fall and livestockprices to rise within the Community.At that point General de Gaulle asked M. Andronikov to see if the other ministers were ready in the Conference Room. He and the Prime Ministeradjourned there for the plenary meeting at 4.25 p.m.RECORD OF A MEETING AT THE ELYSEE PALACE ONWEDNESDAY, 25th JANUARY, 1967, AT 4.25 p.m.The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, m pThe Right Hon. George Brown, m pH E Sir Patrick ReillySir Burke trend sir Con 0&apos;neill mr. W. A. nield mr. A. M. PalliserPresent:President de GaulleM. PompidouM. Couve de MurvilleM. DebreM. AlphandM. de CourcelM. Burin des RoziersM. BrunetM. Andronikov (Interpreter)Problems of United Kingdom entryPresident de Gaulle opened the discussion by thanking the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary for devoting so much time and trouble to their visit to Paris. He had now been informed of their discussions with M. Pompidou andM. Couve de Murville on the previous day on economic and financial issues andof the resumed discussion on agricultural problems that afternoon. The latter were of special importance to the French Government; and it had been very helpful to them to have the British case presented and analysed with such clarityand thoroughness. The exchange of views between the two Governments hadnecessarily been rapid and concentrated; but it had been of great value. It was accepted that the discussions had been in the nature of preliminary soundings,not negotiations. On this basis was there anything further which the PrimeMinister wished to add?
The Prime Ad mister said, in reply, that he wished to thank the President mostwarmly for the hospitality which had been extended by the French Governmentto himself and his colleagues and for the time which French Ministers had devotedto the discussions of the last two days.He was sure that the President would have judged for himself that our new approach to the e.c. was more in earnest and that, as he himself had said inthe House of Commons, we meant business. He agreed that the discussions werenot in the nature of negotiations; they were rather an initial approach, designedto show that, provided our essential interests could be safeguarded, we were anxiousto enter the Community and that we were willing to contemplate thoseadjustments of policy which membership would undoubtedly entail. Butthe Treaty of Rome itself need not be a decisive obstacle to our entry, on thebasis which he had described; nor need the Common Agricultural policy as such. It undoubtedly created serious problems for us; nevertheless, theymight be less serious than we had hitherto supposed. As regards theCommonwealth, the most important issues were those arising in connection with new Zealand and, possibly, the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. As regardsthe price levels prescribed by the Common Agricultural Policy, some were certainlyhigher than either economic sense warranted or the French authorities themselvesdesired. But, even here, there might be reasons for cautious optimism. Thegeneral tendency of world prices of cereals was to rise, as the United Statessurpluses ran down and the import requirements of countries such as India and china continued to escalate. On the other hand, there was no doubt that the adjustments which we should be compelled to make in our own agricultural policiesif we entered the e.c. would be very considerable. The most serious burden which we should have to face would be the payment to the Guidance and guarantee fund under the financial regulations a payment which would entail both budgetaryand balance of payments problems for us. On the other hand, it was surelybeyond dispute that the entry of a new member into the Community would make certain changes in this respect inevitable, if only because a British subscriptionto the Fund calculated on the basis of the existing formula would raise the Fund&apos;income above its legitimate requirements.  Some adjustment would be necessary.The other basic issue which confronted us was the international characterof sterling and the related problem of the sterling balances though not the sterlingparity. He understood that the President had had an opportunity to study the record of his discussion with M. Pompidou on the previous afternoon; and thePresident would therefore be able to appreciate the reasons why we were convincedthat, if we entered the Community, the sterling balances would not be a drag on it.Expansion of the community the accession of a new member perhaps several new members to theCommunity would admittedly involve change. But the Community itself had changed over the last 10 years, even over the last 2 years. The French Governmentshould therefore consider what changes of a different kind might become necessary if, for whatever reason, Britain did not succeed in entering theCommunity. World affairs never remained static; and we lived in a time of rapidchange as was demonstrated by the evolution of the Community itself betweenthe 1950s and the 1960s. But how would it stand in the 1970s if Britain had been unable to enter fully into membership? Clearly, there would be less scope forthe kind of intensified technological collaboration between Britain and the member countries which he had outlined on the previous day; and we should all be weakened in this respect by being compelled to be more dependent on the technological resources of third countries. The effects would be felt not only interms of the relative standards of living of our individual countries but also interms of the independence of Europe as a whole and the part which she could play in world affairs. In fact, the strength of Europe&apos;s voice in international councilswould depend on her technological vigour and independence more than on anyother single factor. Moreover, technology apart, the cdntinued exclusion of Britainfrom the Community would be bound to have far-reaching political results. BecauseEurope would be divided economically, her political unity would be proportionatelydiminished; and the world role which she could play would be far less effective than if France and Britain pursued a common policy, as he believed they could. It wouldoe neither wise nor proper for him to speculate on the steps which Britain mighthave to take in defence of her own interests if her present approach to the
Community ended in failure. But, whatever these steps might be, they wouldbe taken faule de mieux they would represent very much a second best course for us, indeed, for the Six also. Even more, they would be a second best as faras the whole world was concerned, bearing in mind the contribution which a unitedEurope could make to a world which needed all the help and counsel whichEurope could give from her resources of historical experience, political principle and innate qualities of vision and leadership, which Britain and France had shownso often in the past.He and his colleagues would return to London in a spirit of deep gratitude to the French Government for the reception which they had been given. he hoped that in the course of their discussions they had dealt with all the majorimplications of the British approach to the e.c.. It was reasonable that the FrenchGovernment should now need time for consideration and for discussion with their colleagues among the Six. We, for our part, had another four visits to make.Nevertheless, we should leave Paris in the confidence that we had made it clear to the French Government why we felt that our approach was in the interests ofboth Britain and Europe and that the French Government, for their part, would recognise the strength of the case which we had deployed and would support theconclusions which we ourselves had drawn from the arguments and discussions ofthe last days. The decision which faced us all was a vital and historic decision;and it was reasonable that all parties should need further time in which to considerit. At the same time it was an urgent decision in the sense that, although timemight wait for a little, the tide in the affairs of men would not; and that tide was now approaching its critical point.The Foreign Secretary said that there had been a great sense of history aboutthe discussions of the last two days. British accession to the Community wouldcertainly involve change; but it should be possible to face the need for changeprovided that it did not alter and we were convinced that it would not alter-the fundamental character of the Community. Our associates in EFTA understoodthis point as clearly as we did ourselves.At the same time we must also face, as the Prime Minister had suggested, theconsequences if Britain did not succeed in joining the e.c.. And we must beprepared to strike a final balance between those results and the results if we didjoin. It was the more important that we should take this decision seriously in thatthe monolithic character of the history of the last two decades particularly the concept of two Power blocs, locked in rigid opposition was fast disappearing.We were entering a new period of fluidity; and this was the moment at whichEurope had a fresh chance to make its influence felt on a global scale, provided thatit was not economically divided and provided that Britain and France adopted acommon viewpoint from which to consider the great political problems ahead,whether these related to intra-European problems of East-West tension or wereworld-wide in their scope.M. Pompidou observed that there had not been time during the two days&apos;discussions to deal with all the problems which arose from the British approach tothe e.c.; and there was room for further discussion on several issues-e.g.,problems of regional development; the question of the common external tariff;the length of the transitional period or periods which Britain might require indifferent contexts; the need for further clarification of the problem of the sterling area and the sterling balances together with their implications which were politicalno less than economic; the complicated issue of the link between the common agricultural Policy, Britain&apos;s Commonwealth commitments and the balance ofpayments implications for Britain if she endorsed the policy; and so forth. he must emphasise that the Common Agricultural Policy had given rise to veryserious problems within the Community itself before the Six finally succeeded in reaching agreement on it; and it would be very unwise, therefore, to underrate thedifficulties which would arise if it now had to accommodate British entry into theCommunity.In addition, he had been greatly impressed by the Foreign Secretary&apos;sdescription on the previous day of the extent of British interests outside theCommunity. This suggested that there might be great difficulty in absorbing those interests within a Community which was both more restricted in terms of itsgeographical horizons and more protectionist in terms of its economic policies.
Monetary co-operationM. Debre said that some five or six years ago the members of the community had begun to develop a policy of monetary solidarity and freedom of monetarymovements. This was now leading to a common attitude towards international monetary arrangements. This was something which would have to be taken upalso in the context of possible United Kingdom entry into the Community.The Prime Minister agreed that there had been great developments in the monetary field. Yesterday he had dealt only briefly with the problem of capital movements, distinguishing between direct and portfolio investment. In recentyears there had been a good deal of United Kingdom investment in the Community;this was, indeed, part of the key to a common technological advance. He hopedthat it would continue, and that there would be just as much investment fromCommunity countries in the United Kingdom. He then recapitulated briefly the arguments which he had used in distinguishing between direct and portfolio investment in the meeting with M. Pompidou and M. Couve de Murville theprevious afternoon. He concluded that from our point of view time would be needed for adjustment, just as the Six had given themselves time. As to theproblems of the sterling area and sterling balances, we were prepared to discuss these fully with members of the Community who wished to learn our point of view.Here, too, the Prime Minister briefly recapitulated the principal points of the argument which he had developed on the previous day.M. Couve de Murville said that he agreed with Mr. Brown that the political importance of the question posed by the British approach overshadowed theeconomic problems which it involved, in relation both to Europe and to the world as a whole.General de Gaulle&apos;s conclusionsGeneral de Gaulle said he now wished to express the impressions which hehad received from the meeting. These were impressions not, of course, of resultsfor there could be none at this stage, but of the exchange of views that had takenplace.First of all, he had the impression of a British Government which, as alwaysin his past experience, was acting with the greatest solidity and dignity. He hadthe impression of an England which had evolved much from the position it usedto take, which he personally had known so well in the past. He had the impression of an England which now really wished to moor itself alongside the Continent andwas prepared in principle to pledge itself to rules in the formulation of which it had had no part, and which would involve it in definite links with the system which had grown up on the Continent. He had the impression of an England which seemeddisposed to detach itself to some extent from the special relationship which it had,or had had, with the United States, thus enabling it to be a European country:for the basic element of his idea of Europe was that it must be an enfranchisedContinent (affranchi), as indeed it must be to play its proper part in the world.If these impressions were correct (and another important aspect of them related to French and British relations with Eastern Europe) then he welcomed this development.  But what practical conclusions should be drawn?The Common Market existed. It was a reality. It had been constructed withthe utmost difficulty. Its six members, although their economic interests differed,were countries of the same nature. They were countries whose industry, commerce,finance, currency arrangements, agriculture and technology were, not indeedidentical, but very similar. It was this similarity which had made the constructionof the Community possible.  And now it had been constructed.; But the participation of Britain in the Community presented great problems,given the differences of its economic interests, its monetary arrangements, itscontacts with the outside world. To solve all these would be a political as well asan economic problem. Would the presence of the United Kingdom in theCommunity enable it to remain what it now was? This was the question he askedhimself.
If it were to be accepted that Britain could not enter the Community withoutchanging its fundamental character, could some other means of British participationbe found? By this he meant some means other than membership, to attain which appeared extremely difficult, if not impossible.  What alternatives were available?Could there be an arrangement? An association? An agreement between britain and the Six? He asked himself; and the British should know that this wasthe question the French asked themselves.He came to no conclusion, except that he noted the evolution of the british position; it corresponded to his own wishes. He was disposed to study fully thequestion the British had put to themselves-namely, did the conditions exist, ornot exist, for Britain to join the Community.He invited the British to study for their part two alternatives. Eithersomething entirely new; or an agreement for association between Britain and theCommunity to cover their interests and their exchanges.[General de Gaulle did not elucidate what he meant by &quot; something entirely new &quot;. But after the meeting Sir Patrick Reilly asked M. Alphand what the general had meant. M. Alphand replied that he understood the General to mean anentirely fresh start ah initio, which would involve dismantling the european economic Community, and making a new agreement to include Britain.1The Prime Ministers commentsThe Prime Minister observed that General de Gaulle had made a statement of historic importance. He thought the General had correctly understood the determination of the United Kingdom not only to move closer to Europe but tobecome fully involved in her affairs. He appreciated the GeneraEs image of Britainmooring itself alongside the Continent. But perhaps this went too far in implyingmovement by Britain only. He felt that the countries of the mainland were movingtoo. The General had foreseen formidable difficulties in British membership ofthe Community. For their part, the British saw less political significance thandid General de Gaulle in their links, financial and other, with overseas countries.But they remained ready to discuss this aspect of the matter fully, with othermembers of the Community as well as with the French.As for what the General had said of Britain and the United States, britain had never claimed a relationship of a unique character. Certainly she had close relations with the United States; but so had France. The United States, for their part, needed both Britain and France. And, in his experience, the most effectivekind of relationship with the United States was based on strength, not weakness.This went for other relationships too; he thought it applied to relations with theSoviet Union. Britain and France did, indeed, have differences of opinion aboutthe Atlantic Alliance; but he felt they could agree that both of them should be strong in their attitude towards transatlantic relationships.At this point, after interpretation, General cle Gaulle seemed to be about to close the meeting; but the Prime Minister continued. He said he had two morepoints to make.First, he wished to remind the General of the importance which both Britainand France attached to developing their relations with the Soviet Union. their approach was in some respects different; but it was parallel, moving to the sameend. And he would like to remind the General that Britain had taken a leading part in preserving the option of closer relations with the Soviet Union by rejecting the Multilateral Force.The second point related to what General de Gaulle had said about thepossibility of some new form of relationship between Britain and the countries ofthe Community, or a relationship of association, presumably under Article 238 ofthe Treaty of Rome. He did not believe that these provided an answer to theproblems which they had been discussing. In particular such solutions would be unable to mobilise the aspirations of all for closer political involvement. under such a system, the British ship would not be moored alongside the Continent, but would come and go. It would be a commuter relationship, an offshore relationship.M. Couve de Murville had said a few minutes before that the political element in
the process on which the British had embarked was more important than theeconomic element. With this the Prime Minister agreed. He did not think any form of limited economic association could ever generate the political unity whichlay at the heart of the decision he was seeking.ConclusionGeneral cle Gaulle repeated his pleasure at having had these discussions withthe Prime Minister and Mr. Brown. His appreciation of Britain had been enhanced by them; he could only hope that our regard for France had been in no waydiminished. The Prune Minister assured the General that he could indeed beconfident on this point. He thanked him for his courtesy and the time and attentionwhich he and his Ministers had devoted to the discussions.

Palliser M. A. Camus&quot;Building Europe&quot;M. Vanden Boeynants opened the meeting with some words of welcome, andstressed the importance of the visit to both Belgium and Britain. After going overthe programme for the following day, he said he wished to use this restricted andinformal meeting to talk about the problem of Britain&apos;s entry into the e.c. seen in the wider framework of how to &quot; build Europe &quot;.First, he thought progress should be made in building Europe whenever anopportunity to do so occurred. It was necessary to distinguish between economic/political Europe, and scientific or military Europe. The Belgian objective remainedan integrated political Europe, and he hoped that those present would live to seethe day when such a wider comprehensive Europe was achieved. But we had tobe realistic and accept that this was not for to-day. Meanwhile, no opportunityfor building Europe should be missed. Whenever it was possible we should beready to take a step forward, whether in the economic, scientific, political or military field. We might find ourselves doing this sometimes with six partners,sometimes with seven partners or sometimes with twelve. There was nothingextraordinary in this. For instance in NATO, Belgium and Britain were playing afull part, while France was only a partial participant. Complete militaryintegration in peace time was only practised by five out of the six common market countries. If all potential applications to the e.c. were granted, in theeconomic field there would be 10 to 12. There was still no scientific Europeat all. The partners thus need not always be the same for all purposes.In developing his second theme, M. Vanden Boeynants referred to M. HarmeEsidea of the &quot; Tripod &quot;. In essence this was that Europe could only develophealthily if there were a balance between the three Great European Powers, Britain,rrance and Germany, on a basis of equality between the three of them. provided this balance was maintained between the three, the smaller Powers like BelgiumWere prepared to accept a larger measure of influence in the Community for theweat Powers.It followed from this that Europe must include France. It would do no oneanY good for France to isolate herself or be isolated, though one could not. ignoreSECRET&quot;19 g 2
the tendency on the part of France to wish to be the dominant partner. It aisofollowed that Europe must include Germany. Germany was one of the founder-!of Europe, and it was now evident that she had preferred the idea of Europe tothat of nationalism. But she could only resist nationalism so long as visibleprogress towards building Europe was being made, otherwise there was a real risk that she would be affected by French nationalism.Finally, Europe must include Britain. It was inconceivable for belgium to be associated with Germany in Europe while Britain remained outside. Likewiseit was inconceivable for Europe to develop a policy towards the East except inconjunction with Britain. Western Europe could not succeed in any approach to Eastern Europe without first having consolidated the links between its owndemocratic members. Moreover, in the Belgian view, it was essential that thecountry with the greatest democratic and parliamentary tradition should be inEurope so as to ensure that tradition was maintained. In short, the three great powers should all be in. If only two of them were there, things would run smoothlyduring the periods when France and Germany got on together, but when theywere at odds, Europe would suffer.M. Vanden Boeynants&apos; third theme was concerned with whether it waspossible for any progress to be made in building political Europe. M. Harmel had suggested that European States might take up common positions on inter-continental or world questions. Some progress had already been made on this and Belgium would do what it could to keep this idea alive. But M. VandenBoeynants thought that the best immediate prospect of achieving anything wouldbe at the decennial celebrations of the Six in Rome. This was a situation in whicheveryone present would want to show some result, and it was most important that what came out of the meeting should be right and should succeed. In thecircumstances there was a danger that proposals would be made for the sake ofappearances only. In strict confidence and with the request that this shouldnot be recorded M. Vanden Boeynants then disclosed that Belgium had been working on some proposals which he had reason to believe were acceptable to theNetherlands and Luxembourg, but had not yet been broached with anyone else.Before they were taken any further, the Belgian Government wished to haveBritish reactions because, if these were unfavourable, he would wish to reconsider.In putting the proposals forward, he had much in mind recent politicaldevelopments in Germany. He found these disturbing and thought the situation might be improved if some modest step were taken towards political unity inEurope. In this case his idea was that the German Government should itself be induced to propose such a step at Rome. This would be that the Six shouldchoose a short list of subjects, which would be outside the field of defence, and invite Britain, and such other potential applicants for membership of the e.c. as were willing, to join in an informal agreement not to take any external actionin these defined fields without prior consultation with the other parties to theagreement. The subjects he had in mind were:     *European technologyEconomic detente with the east the formation of a solid European front at international conferences. -His proposal was that, as soon as the Six had agreed that a step of this sort was desirable in principle, Britain and other potentially interested countries would beinvited to join at once in the discussion. He thought this would appeal to allconcerned as a limited experiment in the political field, involving no derogationof sovereignty, which would be capable of extension and which included Britain.In concluding his description of his proposal M. Vanden Boeynants emphasisedagain that he would wish to reconsider if Mr. Wilson saw any objection fromthe British point of view. He further emphasised that since the proposal hadnot even been mentioned to the Italians, the Germans or the French, it was extremely important that his confidence should be respected.Mr. Wilson thanked the Belgian Prime Minister for his remarks whichconstituted a historic contribution to the debate on the long-term future olEurope.  He intended to explain in more detail on the following day the Bntisn
position as regards entry into the e.c. and the other communities; tonight, however,he would confine himself to commenting on M. Vanden Boeynants&apos; analysis ofEuropean affairs in the world context. He wished in particular to make three points:(1) M. Vanden Boeynants appeared to be thinking in terms of a european community or communities which might consist of 6, 7, 9, 12 or 13 membersaccording to the function and purpose in question. But it was not possible to solve the main problems of Europe by means of disparate communities withmemberships which differed from time to time. Those problems could only be solved-and even then only by considerable sacrifices on the part of allconcerned, including Britain on the basis of a single community. Its members might have different problems, which would need to be examined on the basisof, as it were, different terms of reference and from different points of view;but they would not be a mere collection of separate countries they would constitute a genuinely united Community. A half-hearted membership of europe would be easy for Britain; but, as he had said in Parliament, the BritishGovernment meant business. And, if this phrase was virtually untranslatableinto French, an alternative way of expressing the thought behind it was to saythat to think in terms of being a member of Europe for some purposes but not for others was far too easy a way out.It had been agreed that defence was a separate issue, which would not figure in the present discussion. But it should not be forgotten that both Britain andBelgium were loyal members of NATO; and their present exchanges must do nothing to weaken its cohesion. It might be possible in due course to work towards an even greater solidarity of our common defence interests; but for thetime being NATO must continue to be the main focus of our combined defenceefforts. By contrast, communities which would differ in membership andsolidarity according to whether it was industry, agriculture or technology whichwas in question would imply that we had failed in our purpose at the very outset.(2) It was true that some existing communities were established on differingbases of membership. But they should not set the pattern for the future. our purpose henceforward was the realisation of a Europe whose solidarity andmomentum would enable it to play a more effective part in world affairs than hitherto. If so, however, there must be change. No institution could exist ona basis of stagnation except perhaps a cemetery, as he had said in hisStrasbourg speech. Moreover, in the great efforts which both the Belgian and theBritish Governments were making to ensure the economic development of their countries they had to fight against vested interests. The same would be true of their joint attempt to create a united Europe; and a mere refusal to acceptchange must be regarded as unacceptable in this context. That did not mean thatwe wanted to change the Treaty of Rome or the e.c. itself. What it did meanwas that we wanted to join the Community in order to widen it and to strengthenit and so to strengthen Europe as a whole. But this would be impossible if wewere only a half-hearted member of Europe a member of some communitiesbut not of others or half in some but half out of the rest. All of us were committed to change. In NATO it was universally recognised that the posture of the 1940s,even of the 1950s, was already out of date. Indeed, it was this realisation whichhad prompted M. HarmeFs proposal that NATO should now subject itself to asearching re-examination in terms of the functions which it ought henceforwardto try to fulfil. But, if this approach was valid in relation to NATO, it was validin relation to Europe&apos;s other problems. The next step in the evolution of the eec, therefore, should be Britain&apos;s entry, which, so far as we were concerned,would be designed to strengthen a Community which we were ready to accept inits essentials.Turning to the question of the political development of Europe, Mr. Wilsonnoted M. Vanden Boeynants&apos; suggestion for the initiative which might be taken on the occasion of the 10th Anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome.We would wish the Belgian Government well in this enterprise. But we must make it clear that, as regards the fundamental question of the political unity ofEurope, we had not so far intervened in any of the discussions on this subject(including the Fouchet Plan) because we were still outside the Community. Forthe same reason we had studied the exchanges last year at Luxembourg with
interest but, here again, had refrained from taking any part so long as we werenot members of the Community. But as soon as we achieved membership-ashe hoped we should we intended to play our full part; and from inside theCommunity we should have a good deal to say. He hoped very much, therefore,that the momentum deriving from the new British approach to the community would not be choked or diverted while the Six discussed the problems of european unity among themselves and Britain continued to remain outside. The processof discussion among the Six could be a lengthy one; and the result might well bethat we should all miss the tide for British entry into the e.c., with all thedamaging consequences, both political and economic, which would then ensue.(3) His third point followed from the first two and was of particular importance.An expanded and strengthened e.c. of the kind which we envisaged was the only means by which the technological potential of Europe could be released in sucha way that it could match the potential of the other Common Market on the other side of the Atlantic and so prevent American technology from dominatingEuropean industry. The resources which the United States commanded in termsof research and development were so great and the American market was so largethat its mere overspill could swamp Europe. The differing histories of the computer industries in France (where they had capitulated to American penetration)and in Britain (where they had defeated it) were an example of this phenomenon.Another was nuclear energy where Belgium led the world in its application tomarine propulsion and Britain in its application to the generation of electricity.(At this point, Mr. Wilson commented on the important practical decisions whichthe Belgian Government would shortly have to take in this context. In one ofthem Electricite de France, in competition with a cheaper and more economicalBritish project, had made it a condition of their offer that an American reactorshould be built. Surely General de Gaulle could hardly approve of that!) It was for these reasons that we must seek to mobilise the technological resources ofEurope to meet the American challenge. But there could not be one Europe,including Britain, for purposes of technological development and another Europe,excluding Britain, for purposes of trade and industry. The Belgian Government,if offered this kind of bargain for themselves, would certainly reject it; and so would we. If we were to share our technological resources, we would do so onlyon the basis of a shared market also. Otherwise, we should find ourselves competing with the United States in the European market from a position outside that market and on the basis that we should both be facing the same level of tariffs. When hehad spoken of the fourth technological community, it was on the basis that britain would already be a member of the other three communities indeed, of all four ofthem, whether they were merged into a single community or not.Recapitulating, Mr. Wilson emphasised that he was concerned to make three points:(a) There must be one European Communityior all purposes.(b) This Community, as we saw it, would take the form of an enlargement anda strengthening of the integration which had already been developedunder the Treaty of Rome, an&apos; integration which.we wished to shareand to carry forward as part of the inevitable process of change.(c) As regards the technological development of Europe, technology and trademust go hand in hand as part of the same Community, the sameCommon Market.He trusted that his Belgian friends would forgive him for speaking franklyand freely; but he had judged this to be right since, to repeat what he had already said, we meant business.M. Vanden Boeynants thanked Mr. Wilson for his remarks. He wished tomake one point clear in case Mr. Wilson had not fully understood his originalstatement. When he had distinguished, in his opening remarks, between thedifferent functional aspects of Europe and the different senses in which one couldconceive of a European Community, he had not been describing the objective ofpolicy he had merely been stating what was no more than a fact of life. europe in the military sense was not the same as Europe in the economic sense; and europe in the political sense, in so far as it existed at all, was different again. Both
Belgium and Britain wanted one Europe and one Community. But not everybodyshared their views; and, until Belgium and Britain could realise all their commonobjectives, they must be realistic and be content to proceed one step at a time, evenif successive steps were not always taken with the same partners. He must repeat,however, that the Belgian Governments basic purpose was the same as that of theBritish Government-it was one Community, including Britain, in which thepolitical, economic and scientific functions would coincide perhaps even eventually the military function as well, though this was beset with difficulties.At this point, M. Harmel intervened to re-emphasise the point made earlier byM. Vanden Boeynants that the European Community thus outlined by Mr. Wilsonmust include all three Great European Powers France, Germany and Britain.Mr. Wilson thanked M. Vanden Boeynants for clarifying his original remarks.But, even if we had to be content with one step at a time, that step must leadtowards, not away from, our basic objectives.M. Vanden Boeynants agreed. He said that perhaps the discussion might nowbe adjourned until the following morning. The Belgian Government welcomed the enthusiastic determination of Britain to enter the Community. Perhaps it wasparadoxical that it should be the Belgian Government who were now sounding anote of caution. But they were doing so only because they wished to be realisticin their approach to the problem. Fundamentally, they were on the samewavelength as the British Government-certainly as regards Europe&apos;s technological development, as he would seek to demonstrate on the following day. It was essential that Belgium and Britain should agree on this subject, which was vital to both of them in terms particularly of their relationship with the United StatesBelgium, like Britain, was a friend of the United States-but not an unconditionalfriend. Belgium, like Britain, preferred to leave unconditional attitudes toGeneral de Gaulle.RECORD OF A MEETING HELD BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTERAND THE FOREIGN SECRETARY AND THE BELGIAN PRIMEMINISTER AND THE BELGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AT THEMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, BRUSSELS, ON 1st FEBRUARY,1967, AT 9.30 a.m.Present:The Right Hon.

Background to the United Kingdom initiativeMr. Wilson thanked M. Vanden Boeynants very warmly for his welcome theprevious evening. The Embassy Press Services were efficient but he had so faronly read accounts in the British Press of matters which had not even been mentioned in their discussions the previous evening. The Belgian Governmentwould already have had a full account from Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador of the talks which had taken place in Rome and Paris; but it might be useful if he wentbriefly over the background to the present visit and those to the other capitals ofthe Six. Their purpose was to ascertain the likely attitude of the community to our accession to the Treaty of Rome. After the visits to the Six Heads ofGovernment if would be necessary for us to decide whether to begin negotiationsfor entry into the Community and at what time entry should be made. He neednot amplify what he had said in the House of Commons on 10th November sinceM. Vanden Boeynants had quoted &quot; we mean business &quot; on the previous evening.He was clearly fully apprised of the purpose of the visit.Since the British Governments decision to undertake these visits two events had occurred. The first had been a two-day debate in the House of commons in which strong support had been expressed by members of all parties for british entry into the Community. He did not think that recent publicity emanating from London altered the views which had been expressed on that occasion or the emphasis Her Majesty&apos;s Government laid on their approach to Europe.The second event had been the meeting of Heads of EFTA Governments inLondon at which the initiative being taken by Britain had been warmly welcomed.The visits which were now being undertaken were thus a logical extension of theprocess begun in the previous summer of determining whether conditions existed for negotiation and whether, if we embarked on a negotiation, if could be broughtto a successful conclusion.A recent study by the Confederation of British Industry had come out instrong support of Britain joining the Community, provided that certain problemscould be overcome. He was not empowered to speak on behalf of the otherEFTA Governments, who would have to conduct individual negotiations if they wanted to become full or associate members of the Community: but there wasno doubt of the goodwill extended to Britain in her present talks by the othermembers of EFTA.Treaty of RomeBefore dealing with the questions which would form the substance of that day&apos;s discussions, he wanted to make clear again the British position towardsthe Treaty of Rome. He had said both in Rome and in Paris that the Treatyof Rome was not in itself an impediment to British entry. It need not be an obstacle if our problems could be dealt with satisfactorily whether throughadaptations of arrangements made under the Treaty or in any other acceptablemanner, As he had said the previous evening, Britain would be prepared toaccept the Treaty of Rome subject to the necessary adjustments consequent uponthe accession of a new member and provided that we received satisfaction on thepoints of difficulties we foresaw. We did not believe that the widening of theCommunity, implicit in the entry of Britain and other countries and the processof change that must inevitably follow, need imply any weakening of theCommunity or of its economic or political purposes. Rather we believed thatthe consequence of our entry would be the strengthening of the Community.Certain difficulties had been suggested as impediments to our entry, for example,that our economy was weak. It was true that, when the present Government had come to office in 1964, they had inherited serious balance of payments difficulties.But since then our balance of payments deficit had been reduced. We were nowin balance and would be moving into surplus in the present year.So far as trade was concerned, we had had a monthly trade deficit in 1964running at a figure of  45 million; in 1965 this had been reduced to  23 million;in 1966 it had been halved again to  12 million. If one recalled that over the last half century Britain had hardly even been in direct trading surplus, the BelgianGovernment would realise the importance of the fact that over the last six monthsour trading balance, seasonally adjusted, had been in surplus and this had been achieved even before the measures taken in July 1966 had worked through fully
and made an impact on our trading figures. Nevertheless, he would not disguisethe fact that there were problems of a monetary nature which he would be happy to deal with during the discussions.Points of difficulty in British membership of the EECIn order to provide a factual basis for these discussions, it might be helpful ifhe were to mention briefly what we believed to be the major points of difficulty,either for Britain or for the Six, in our becoming a member of the Community!They were the problems arising from the Common Agricultural Policy as it had emerged over the last few years; Commonwealth questions; problems related to thefreedom of capital movements; and problems of encouraging particular regions-a problem with which the Belgian Government would be familiar and on whichBelgium had made substantial progress.The first two were essentially different aspects of the same problem. Most ofthe difficulties would arise over agriculture on which he would not expatiate, since it would be dealt with in more detail later. He had commented on the problemof capital movements during the visits to Rome and Paris and he would beprepared to deal briefly with the matter later in the day.Kennedy RoundAs he had said on the previous evening, it was important to link the timing of the present talks with the negotiations in the Kennedy Round. Our presentinitiative and our interest in the membership of the Community did not in anyway imply a reduction of interest or a diminution in our sense of urgency in thesuccessful outcome of the Kennedy Round. If anything, the talks highlightedthe importance of a successful outcome in the near future of the Kennedy Round.In conclusion he considered that in the series of visits to the Six Heads ofGovernment the British Government would not be asking for anything which itwas impossible to negotiate. We would be seeking to safeguard our essential interests in the same way as the Six themselves had done in the course of thenegotiations which had led to the establishment of the Community. Over thelast 10 years, with a great deal of give and take and mutual understanding, thepresent members had built up their own Community. There were challengingproblems to be faced but they could be dealt with. The Community had a greatfuture in Europe with all it meant for technological development, the freeing oftrade, the ending of economic divisions in Europe and in the context of the growth and development of Europe as a political unity of which the first stage only hadbeen reached and the future of which it was impossible yet to forecast. In conclusionhe thanked M. Vanden Boeynants for his hospitable welcome and for listening tothe exposition of the British case.Belgiuin&apos;s attitudeM. Vanden Boeynants thanked Mr. Wilson for putting the British case sosuccinctly and so positively. He had told him the previous evening of Belgium&apos;sdeclared views about British entry into Europe. He had now heard a furtherexposition of Britain&apos;s intentions and he could say at once that, although problemsconfronted Britain in connection with entry into the Common Market, the BelgianGovernment believed that they could be overcome and that Britain&apos;s desire toenter was sincere and incontestable. What was the Belgian Governments positionin relation to this desire? He need not repeat what he had said the previous evening. The Belgian Government were in favour of Britain&apos;s accession and considered that for the future of Europe and especially for its political unity (the aim for which they all strove) the entry of Britain into the Community wasindispensable.Several months previously the Belgian Government, together with theNetherlands Government, had proposed that no more decisions should be takenin the Community which might have the effect of widening the gap between theCommunity and Britain and thus of making Britain&apos;s entry more difficult. Belgiumwanted to see Britain in the Community and welcomed her present initiative inundertaking talks.
BelgiunTs questionsHe was sure that Mr. Wilson would want him to speak directly and franklvGiven the fact that Belgium ardently desired Britain&apos;s entry, he felt it right to discusspossible obstacles to her entry. For this purpose he would raise a number of questions or preoccupations which were troubling his Government.(1) Mr. Wilson had said that Britain accepted the Treaty of Rome, subject tocertain adjustments to the arrangements which had been devised under the treaty the Belgian Government would like to know what the scope of those adjustmentsmight be and which questions the British Government envisaged as the most difficult to resolve. M(2) The entry of Britain into the Community would pose the problem ofthe accession of other countries. Mr. Wilson had already said that he was notempowered to speak on behalf of other EFTA Governments; but did Britainconsider that her entry would lead inevitably to the entry of one, two, three or perhaps six other countries? It was evident that the entry of other countries would profoundly change the Community as it at present existed. This change the Belgian Government were ready to accept but they would like to know whatlimits would be placed on such change, since they wanted a real Common market to continue as it had been created. He had heard it suggested from other capitalsof the Six that other formulae had been put forward for the future pattern of theCommunity if it were to admit new members. What were the British governments views.on this?(3) The Belgian Government did not want the enlargement of the community to compromise its dynamism and efficiency. He would like therefore to know the British Governments views on (a) The future of the Commission which had played a dynamic role infashioning the Community.(b) The Council of Ministers whose workings the Belgian Government wouldnot wish to be jeopardised. (He recalled that a year previously in luxembourg five out of the six partners in the Community had voted in favour of majority voting.)(c) The political purpose of the Treaty of Rome which remained theCommunity&apos;s final objective and which should not be jeopardised.(d) If Britain entered the Community, the possibility that she would alsoaccede to EURATOM and the European Coal and Steel Community.(4) Mr. Wilson had referred to adjustments which Britain would wish todiscuss in the arrangements which had been worked out under the Treaty of Rome.How did Britain see the discussion of this problem and would these adjustmentsbe dealt with before or after Britain&apos;s entry into the Community? Were the adjustments permanent or merely transitional? If the latter, how long wouldthey last? Finally, if Britain were admitted to the Community, would she seek to make other additional adjustments once she had gained membership?These were points on which the Belgian Government would be glad to haveelucidation. His questions had been formulated in the hope that a positivesolution could be found both in bilateral discussions between the Belgian andBritish Governments and also in common discussions among the Six.He suggested that the rest of the day might be devoted to the discussion inthe morning of the Common Agricultural Policy, Commonwealth problems, andthe entry of other EFTA countries; and in the afternoon of institutional problems,the functions and operation of the Common Market and monetary questions.Treaty of Rome: Adaptations of the Treaty; Community Institutions; EFTAMr. Brown said that there appeared to be some misunderstanding over thequestion of adaptations. The Treaty of Rome already contained provision for amending the Community&apos;s arrangements upon the entry of a new member, andin these circumstances Britain would be able to accept the Treaty as it stood: therewould be no question of seeking to rewrite the Treaty of Rome. On the questionof accession to the Treaty by other countries, it was the general view both inside and outside the Community that this should take place in the interests of thepolitical and economic strength of Europe. The fewer the divisions that existed in Europe the better it would be for the Continent as a whole.   Europe could
not be strong, dynamic and influential whilst economic divisions remained; andit was the hope of the British Government that there would be a greater measureof unification in Western Europe and eventually a further rapprochement betweengastern and Western Europe. It was possible that some other members of EFTAwould be ready for full membership of the Community while others for political reasons might prefer association. It was for individual members of EFTA todecide on this point and to determine the terms of their own applications.M. Vanden Boeynants had asked what were the limits which we envisaged forthe expansion of the Community. This was difficult to say since it was not atpresent clear which countries would wish to join; but the objective must be a western Europe in which economic divisions no longer existed.Reference had been made to a dislike of upsetting the existing dynamism ofthe Commission and of the Council of Ministers through the entry of Britain.But if we were admitted, we would not wish to disturb this dynamism and we saw no reason why this should happen. Britain with her external links and influence would constitute an addition to the power, dynamism and influence of theCommunity and would in no way seek to change its basic institutions. Ratherwe would wish to play our full part but no more than our full part in theworking of the Community&apos;s institutions on the basis set out in the Treaty of rome and consistent with the general aims of the Treaty. We would wish tojoin the ECSC and EURATOM separately, should they continue as at present or if they fused into one, the new organisation.The question had been raised which adaptations to the existing arrangements under the Treaty would be transitional and which would be permanent upon the entry of Britain into the Community as also had the extent to which we might seek to secure further adaptations after accession. He doubted whether theindividual members of the Community at the time of their signature of the Treatyof Rome had given binding undertakings not to raise further matters of this character after accession. Likewise a new member today could not be expectedto give any such binding assurance before entry. Experience had shown that themembers of the Community had found it necessary to raise a number of issuesduring the course of the Community&apos;s existence; but he could say frankly that britain had no intention of entering the Community with the clear intention of raising issues subsequently.Mr. Brown indicated that there were two major issues which raised problems not insurmountable where something more than purely transitional arrangements might be required. First, there was the effect on Britain of the common agricultural Policy. Acceptance of this policy would raise a number of differentproblems for which, amongst other things, transitional periods of differing lengthswould be necessary. In general, however, if commodity prices were to remain attheir current levels and the arrangements for financing the Guidance and guarantee fund were to be unaltered, Britain would need to pay in to the Fund 90 per cent of the levies on her imported food; this would constitute., a very substantial andinequitable financial burden. Secondly, the problems raised by our membership ofthe Commonwealth were difficult; but it had been generally accepted that they couldall be overcome through transitional arrangements with the exception of our tradewith New Zealand for which some form of permanent arrangement would almost certainly be required. He believed that the Community recognised that NewZealand constituted a special problem tp be tackled. There were, of course,other problems for us, notably the question of capital movements; but this wasa question not for ourselves alone but also for the Community whose members would surely be anxious to ensure that capital arising from savings within theCommunity was not used to build up the economies of countries outside Europe.Only by building up the European economy could the challenge of the two greatworld Powers be met, in particular the challenge presented by United Statestechnology.(At this point M. Vanden Boeynants left in order to attend a meeting of theBelgian Parliament.)M. Harmel said that he had noted what Mr. Brown had said about solvingproblems in advance of Britaiirs accession to the Community, about the heavy burden which agricultural levies would impose and about exceptional treatment for New Zealand alone among other Commonwealth countries. Were there anyfurther qualifications he wished to make?
Mr. Brown emphasised that it was adaptations under Article 237 of theTreaty of Rome which we had in mind. Such problems as those presented by the Community&apos;s Common Agricultural Policy, our relations with other membersof the Commonwealth, notably those in Africa and New Zealand, theCommonwealth Sugar Agreement, and the regional policies which we were pursuingin Britain, could be met by adaptations to the arrangements made under theTreaty of Rome and did not presuppose a change in the Treaty itself. britain was in no way seeking to change the provisions of the Treaty of Rome.Expansion of the CommunityM. Harmel said the expansion of the Community as it currently existed or might exist in future raised certain difficulties of principle. Even though britain were ready to accept the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, certain countries feltthat with the extension and widening of the Community the problems of the Sixwould be accentuated to such an extent that the Community might prove difficultto govern and indeed might become non-viable. This was however not the viewheld by the Belgian Government who agreed that as many countries as possible should join. The e.c. had started out as an economic Community but its aimwas ultimately to become a political entity. Should a number of countries follow the lead of Britain in trying to enter the Community difficulties would certainlyarise; and it might be helpful if the British Government were to give some indication of what in their view these might be.Mr. Brown replied that the British Government accepted the idea of a politicalCommunity implicit in the Treaty of Rome. But there were different views in belgium, in Britain and elsewhere in Europe about the form which this politicalunity might take: it might for example be federal or national. On entering theCommunity we would expect to play our part in working out an answer to theproblem of real political unity and securing a form which would be universallyacceptable. We were not however taking part in the discussion of this issue yetsince it seemed improper for us to do so whilst outside the e.c.; once in, we would wish to play our part in giving political reality to the concept of a united Europe.On the question of further countries wishing to join the e.c. in the wake of Britain,he was pleased to learn that Belgium did not see this is a problem; he would indeed be surprised if many others saw it in&apos;this light. One could not favour dynamismand at the same time be against change. Countries joining the Community would raise new challenges and present new opportunities and this was the answer tothose who wished to remain undisturbed in their &quot; cosy little nest &quot;. The Treaty of rome provided for the accession of other European countries and so envisaged the dynamism and progress to which M. Vanden Boeynants had referred.M. Harmel said that a preoccupation with the possibility of &quot; something new&quot;to replace the existing Community did not exist in Belgium but arose from theinformation which they had received regarding earlier visits by Mr. Wilson andMr. Brown to the Heads of Government of the e.c.. The Belgian and the british attitude in this respect seemed to be similar and he was grateful to have receivedthe assurance that, despite the problems presented for Britain in acceding to theTreaty of Rome, there would be no question of seeking to alter the fundamentalnature of the Community.Mr. Wilson endorsed what Mr. Brown had said about resistance to changebeing inconsistent with the concept of dynamism. While metaphors and analogiescould be dangerous, he liked to regard the Community as having built a railway line towards their objective on which had been set a train. An extension of theCommunity meant more coaches and a more powerful engine. It did not meandisturbing either the track which had been laid down or altering the signals.M. Harmel welcomed Mr. Wilson&apos;s analogy as demonstrating the closeness ofthe British and Belgian positions. He saw the entry of Britain into the e.c. as providing the Community with a more powerful engine. But any enlargement ofthe Community would necessitate a further examination of its rules in order tosee whether they were appropriate to a larger Community.Common Agricultural PolicyMr. Brown said our attitude to the Common Agricultural Policy was similarto the view we took of the Treaty of Rome. It was not an obstacle in itself. Wepreferred our own system of agricultural support but we could adjust to the
Community&apos;s system. We were not therefore making an issue of principle out ofthe Common Agricultural Policy.But four consequential problems arose, all serious though of differing degrees of seriousness. And we would need the help of the members of the community to meet them.  He would take them in ascending order of gravity.(1) The first difficulty arose from the effect of the present Communityagricultural price levels on the cost of living in Britain. We had said several timespublicly that we estimated the retail price of food would rise by between 10 and14 per cent. Whether or not it did so depended of course on what price levelsmight obtain within the Community after intra-Community negotiations in 1969.Moreover the degree to which the rises in British price levels would have damagingeffects on our prices and incomes and stabilisation policies would be greatlyaffected by the period over which the new prices had to be introduced. If theyhad to come all at once then the effect would probably be intolerable. If theywere approached over a long transitional period then the effect might be almostunnoticeable. A transitional period would be needed; perhaps it would be between these two extremes.(2) The second area of difficulty was the distorting effect of Community price levels on the present pattern of agricultural production in Britain. There wouldbe a tendency to greater production of cereals; and the smaller producers of livestock would tend to be damaged. These producers were very numerous andthere would be a difficult social problem of readjustment, which might need to becarried out over a considerable period. We should require understanding from our future partners in the Community upon the transitional period necessary tobring this adjustment about. We should also require their understanding in orderthat we might retain monies for the reconstruction necessary to effect the adjustment. He thought that what we should seek in this field would be well within the terms of the Common Agricultural Policy.(3) The third area of difficulty consisted of the consequences for commonwealth trade. Transitional arrangements might be made to cover theproblems of Australia and Canada. The Commonwealth Sugar Agreement also raised a problem. But New Zealand was, he thought, the only real and continuingdifficulty in this field. He thought that all members of the Community would need to face the fact and he thought they all did that a permanent and continuingarrangement might be necessary in order to assure New Zealand of continuedoutlets for her agricultural produce.(4) Finally the most grave difficulty arose from the effects on Britain&apos;s balanceof payments. There was a problem if we had to pay higher prices for importedfood. We were after all the largest importer of agricultural produce, much larger than any of the present members of the Community. If in addition we had topay across the exchanges 90 per cent of the levies imposed on agricultural importsthis constituted a very serious problem and would produce an exceedinglyinequitable position. Germany was the largest importer of leviable imports atpresent  640 million. We imported  970 million of agricultural produce of which 640 million came from sources outside an expanded Community. If thereforeprice levels remained as at present and the financial arrangements were not changed, we should be paying more than all the other members of the Communityadded together. He repeated that this would constitute a very serious burdenand would be seen by everyone to produce an inequitable result.The difficulty was compounded by the fact that we had a soundly based and efficient agriculture; and productivity was rising year by year at a high rate. this meant that we would have no substantial claim on Community funds.He therefore suggested that on the basis of equity and because of the serious effect on the British balance of payments some changes would have to be initiatedm order to produce a different result. To some extent the question might be met by transitional periods, but something more fundamental was also required.Mr. Brown&apos;s conclusion was that none of the agricultural problems that hehad mentioned was unsurmountable and that none suggested that we were notjn a position to accept the Common Agricultural Policy, but some changes wouldbe required.
M. Harmel thanked Mr. Brown for his precise exposition of the British positionOf course to consider agriculture entirely separately meant that one was looking atan incomplete and rather inexact picture. There was an industrial counterpart ofthe agricultural question. Whenever a decision had needed to be taken withinthe Community upon agricultural problems it had been necessary for the members to bear in mind not only the agricultural burdens but the advantages in other industrial sectors. He was sure that the British Government had this wider picturein mind.He added that the Community&apos;s Agricultural Policy had been further developedthan it was in 1963. A philosophy had been built up based on three main ideas-Community preferences, the free movement of goods, and Communityresponsibility for the marketing of surplus agricultural produce. It was on these three principles that the Community regulations had been built. He thought itwould be difficult to fit new ideas into a framework which had already been sofully elaborated.He turned to the four points which Mr. Brown had raised.(1) His understanding was that the question of the cost of living in theUnited Kingdom was one capable of solution by a transitional period. This was for negotiation.(2) He understood also that the distortions in the pattern of British agricultural production might require some structural conversion. As he understood it, wewere merely asking for the understanding of our prospective Community partners,and for a transitional period.(3) As regards the Commonwealth problem he understood that the onlyproblem of a persistent nature was that of New Zealand. He would like to askfor some clarification on this point. Did we intend to ask for special treatment for New Zealand, and if so how long would it be expected to last? Any mention of permanency was a frightening concept to the Belgian Minister of Agriculture.(4) Finally, Mr. Brown had said that the most important area of difficulty was that involving the balance of payments. In our calculations we had basedourselves upon a continuation of the present trends and currents of trade. If weproduced more cereals we should import less and fewer levies would fall to be paid.He understood that we would require a transitional arrangement and someadaptation. He would ask M. van Elslande to put further questions on thispoint. It was his understanding however that we would want a modification of the key by which national contributions were paid for agricultural purposes. If we wanted more fundamental modification he would be grateful if we could elaborateour position further.Mr. Brown said he had two comments at this stage. First, as regardsreconstruction of British agriculture, he had mentioned more than just a transitional period. He would like the Community to consider the question of the special grants to farmers in certain regions which we made at present; they might be a pattern for the wider changes that would be needed upon our entry to theCommunity. He felt sure that this concept was within the scope of the common agricultural Policy; he would like to use for this purpose some of the levieswe should otherwise leave with the Community.His second point wus that we had not consulted New Zealand at this stage.In theory there were however a number of ways in which the New Zealand problem could be overcome perhaps by a Morocco-type protocol, perhaps by an association agreement with an enlarged Community under Article 238, perhaps bylevy-free or reduced levy quotas. It was not necessary to use the word permanentto describe whatever was done. He felt sure however that it was possible to produce a satisfactory result which would in practice permanently take care of the NewZealand problem without prejudice to the Community&apos;s Common agricultural policy.Mr. Wilson said, in expansion of Mr. Brown&apos;s remarks about the adaptationswhich would be needed in British agriculture, that at present we had a programmeof assistance to remoter areas of the country to grow beef and mutton, of which wewere large importers. We paid substantial grants for this purpose. To the extent that the Agricultural Fund could be called on to support such operations thebalance of payments problem would be limited.
On the broader question it was, as M. Harmel had said, true up to a point that more attractive prices would result in greater production and smaller imports into Britain and this would reduce levy payments, but the danger was that, ifCommunity prices stayed as at present, we would secure a wrong use ofagricultural resources both in Britain and in the Community. We were alreadylarge producers of cereals. If there were an incentive to produce more cerealsin Britain one result might be that we should actually export cereals. we certainly had no ambition to be the granary of Europe. He thought that resourcesmight be better used in concentrating on livestock production, but this would bedifficult because of the present price relationships within the Community.On the financial regulation M. Harmel had said that there were industrialgains to be set against the agricultural disadvantages. We had indeed tried toconsider the pluses and minuses together. There would of course be changes in trade in industrial products. It would be easier for us to sell to the Community.But equally it would be easier for the Community to sell to Britain. these changes would certainly be very healthy. Most industrial experts believed thatthere would be increased trade in both directions but it was impossible to sayquite how the balance would lie. But if we had to pay over  200 million as aresult of the Common Agricultural Policy this would involve the acceptance ofa crippling burden to make possible the changes in industrial trade. The way welooked at this question was that in the difficult and protracted negotiations withinthe Community the present members had produced a system of providing thenecessary income to the Guarantee Fund to meet calls upon it. British entry,together with the entry of some other EFTA countries, would double the income of the Fund. But Britain, as a major importer of food, would have to pay leviesequivalent to those paid by the existing members of the Community. There wastherefore a case for a change resulting from the entry of a major food importer;but it would still be inequitable if the contributions to the Fund were merelyscaled down proportionately, leaving Britain still to meet half the cost.M. Van Elslande said that there were two points which he would like toraise in connection with what had just been said by Mr. Wilson. The first wasthe question of levies and the second the reconstruction of British agriculture.He considered that levies should be looked at as part of the whole complex of financing the Common Agricultural Policy, although he could appreciate the concern which Britain felt about the impact of the levy system. At present only40 per cent of the Agricultural Fund came from levies, the other 60 per centcoming from contributions from the member States of the Community. the key or breakdown of the 60 per cent was as follows:8 -1 Belgium32 - 0 France31-2 Germany20-3 italy -2 Luxembourg8-2 NetherlandsThis apportionment would remain effective until 31st December, 1969, but the assessment thereafter would be open to negotiation.If he understood the position aright, Britain expended in all  250 million indeficiency payments and in subsidies for structural changes in British agriculture.The  100 million which was spent on the latter would be eliminated as soon asBritain entered the Common Market; she would also have access to the guarantee fund. This meant that the Community would be helping to pay for thereconstruction of agriculture in Britain. He thought this was a point to be keptm mind. It was not possible to say at present that the financial burden onBritain of adopting the Common Agricultural Policy would amount to  x. Theadoption of the Common Agricultural Policy had to be seen in a global contextm relation to the 40 per cent levies and the 60 per cent contributions. If britain were to join the Community, the apportionment of the 60 per cent would haveto be reviewed and discussed; and since Britain would save  100 million per.annum on reconstruction grants and would have the benefit of access to therund she stood to gain rather than to lose by acceding.. Mr. Brown said that he would like to think that what M. Van Elslande had just said was the case. It did not, however, follow that all our production grants
to farmers would lapse if we adopted the Common Agricultural Policy. It wasnot necessarily the case that the present members of the Community did not payproduction grants to their own farmers. Moreover, even if there were anydomestic budgetary saving, this would not help the balance of payments sincepayments would still have to be made across the exchanges into the guarantee fund. It was the question of exchange payments rather than the amount of thepayments which was inequitable. Although the percentages were at present 40and 60, if Britain entered the Community and the system remained unchangedthe 40 per cent in levy payments would be likely to increase and the 60 per centin contributions from members would come down. Britain would be preparedto pay her fair share but would still have to pay over the exchanges an amountequivalent to the contributions of all the other present members of the Community.His conclusion was that, despite the encouraging words spoken byM. Van Elslande, further examination of the problem was required.Mr. Wilson said that, although M. Van Elslande had said that there was no guarantee that Britain would have to pay substantial amounts across the exchangesto the detriment of our balance of payments, there was equally no guarantee thatwe would not have to pay such amounts.M. Harmel said that the question of the figures had better be left in view ofthe need to bring the morning session to a close. The questions his Governmenthad raised were not intended to complicate the problems facing Britain. He notedthat the effect on the balance of payments of adopting the Common agricultural policy was the most important of the difficulties envisaged in Britain&apos;s accession to the Community. Study of the problems involved should continue and understanding of them should continue to be shown on both sides of the table.Mr. Brown said that he also wanted to put on record the question of arranginga form of association for Commonwealth countries in the Caribbean and in Africaif Britain joined the Community. He did not think that associated status for them would present a real difficulty.Mr. Wilson said that the discussion on the Common Agricultural Policy hadbeen useful; further aspects of agricultural policy might be discussed in the afternoon, although most of the ground had been covered and it would not benecessary to go into details over the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.The meeting adjourned at 11.45 a.m.RECORD OF A MEETING HELD BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTERAND THE FOREIGN SECRETARY AND THE BELGIAN PRIMEMINISTER AND THE BELGIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AT THEMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, BRUSSELS, ON WEDNESDAY,1st FEBRUARY, 1967, AT 4 p.m.Mr. T.

Community institutionsU, Harmel said that the greater the number of members of the community the more perfect its institutions must be. It would be inadvisable in thesecircumstances to regard the Commission as no longer possessing activeresponsibility it must be allowed to function both de facto and de jure and know what its mandate was. With an increase in the number of states represented inthe Council of Ministers, the proceedings for the conduct of their deliberationsbecame more important. This was a question which had been considered atLuxembourg where the importance of the principle of majority voting had emerged. It was essential that this form of procedure should continue since, withthe greater the representation on the Council, the greater would be the difficulty ofsecuring unanimity in a vote. On the other hand, questions which had alreadybeen decided on the basis of unanimity could not be changed by a majority vote.For the future it should be the aim for all decisions to be taken unanimously, but where this was not possible, there would have to be a strict application of theprovisions of the Treaty of Rome. The entry of a great State into the e.c.,followed possibly by a number of others, would make it even more important to specify the institutional procedures which should govern discussions within theCommunity.Mr. Brown said that it must be recognised that the accession of new members to the e.c. presented not a problem but a challenge to the rest of the Communityeven though the mechanics of its operation might become more difficult. Britainfully appreciated the argument for majority voting, although we considered itwrong for us to express a view on the subject while still outside the Community.If we entered the Community, we would be willing to operate any system of majorityvoting which was acceptable to the Community as a whole.M. Vanden Boeynants thanked Mr. Brown for his important statement of attitude and proposed that the discussion should now turn to monetary problems,capital movements and technology.Capital movementsMr. Wilson said that on the matters discussed in the morning relating to theCommon Agricultural Policy and the position of our partners in the Commonwealthhe had nothing to add. He now proposed to turn to the question of capital movements which raised certain difficulties for Britain if one looked at the precise terms of the Treaty of Rome. But we were more interested in what had happened in practice in the past than in the strict letter of the Treaty.The Treaty of Rome drew a distinction between direct and portfolio investment.As an example of direct investment, Mr. Wilson cited the example of a Germanfirm setting up a subsidiary to carry out manufacturing on its behalf in France,Italy or possibly in Britain after entry into the e.c. and providing the necessarycapital. This was a situation which it was a corollary of the existence of theCommunity to permit and encourage. Upon entry into the e.c. Britain might need a little time to operate the system as had some of the,Six at the outset of theCommunity: but we saw no real problem here. Freedom of portfolio investment,on the other hand, constituted a different question. At the present time Britainexercised a tight control over portfolio investment by its citizens in non-scheduledterritories, i.e., those outside the sterling area; some countries in the e.c. had nocontrols whatsoever over investment moving outside the Community and there wasno general control such as that currently exercised by ourselves. Many people in britain wished to invest in the United States and Latin America and were unableto do so now except under stringent rules. Freedom for British investors ofportfolio investment in the e.c. countries would enable money to go outside theCommunity, for example, to the United States. He did not regard it as a Europeantask to provide investment capital for property deals in America a country whichcould hardly be regarded as under-developed. Complete freedom from controls inthis context could result in a very substantial drain of funds from Europe acrossthe exchanges with a particularly adverse effect on Britain&apos;s balance of payments.There was a clear distinction between direct investment which encouragedtrade and exports and portfolio investment which was of a purely financialcharacter and sometimes highly speculative in nature. In his view the whole problem was capable of solution but only if the distinction between direct andportfolio investment were maintained.SECRET7719 i
M. Vanden Boeynants replied that Mr. Wilson&apos;s outline of the position wentsome way towards meeting many of the anxieties which had been felt in Belgiumon this score and which had aroused considerable interest. He proposed to askM. Harmel, who had already had some discussions with the Belgian Minister ofFinance and other specialists, to explain how the Belgian Government saw theproblem and what were their ideas regarding possible solutions.M. Harmel said that reports had been received from the Belgian Embassies in rome and Paris on the economic situation in Britain with particular reference tothe balance of payments as these subjects had been developed during the visitsof Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown to those capitals. The Belgian Government greatlyadmired the energy of the British Government in tackling these problems andthey welcomed the prospect of Britain achieving equilibrium on its external account in the near future.The problem which had been raised by Mr. Wilson and which had now been passed to him by his own Prime Minister related to the question of investment.On this the Belgian Minister of Finance would wish to consider the matter further;but in the meantime he proposed to put forward some views which would reflectthose of his financial colleague. He welcomed the distinction which the BritishGovernment made between direct and portfolio investment. He welcomedespecially the fact that we saw little difficulty over the question of direct investmentsince this was vital for the expansion of engineering and technology, particularlyin relation to the computer industry where Britain was currently in the lead. he appreciated that portfolio investment presented a more difficult problem in which both the Belgian Government and others were particularly interested since theTreaty of Rome provided certain specific safeguards. In his experience, however,such activities tended to be rather limited and not likely to produce effects injurious to national economies. Admittedly there was a risk in this for all, but Belgianexperience so far had not assessed the risk as particularly serious. This was alsoa two-sided question: in addition to the situation which Mr. Wilson had described,there was the possibility of e.c. monies being invested through Britain in the restof the sterling area. He was, however, confident that a solution to the problem could be found.Mr. Wilson echoed M. Harmel&apos;s confidence that a solution could be foundbut noted that the problem existed despite the very clear exposition of the belgian governments view. He had already provided figures of Britain&apos;s current trade balance and the financial columns of reputable newspapers showed the present state of sterling and the general confidence in it. He expressed our appreciation of the help given by the Belgian Central Bank (which he was sure reflected the goodwill of the Belgian Government) during the first two years of his administration.The Labour Government had inherited in 1964 a balance of payments deficit of 800 million; this had been reduced to  320 million in 1965 and had been cutsubstantially again in 1966. The prospect for 1967 was that the British economy would be moving into surplus on external account. Any pressure on sterlingnormally arose from weakness in the balance of payments and for that reason it had been his Governments first priority to correct Britain&apos;s foreign exchange position. With this objective they had accorded priority to exports, had sought to avoid inflation by adopting a firm prices and incomes policy, and had imposed a control over excessive capital movements.The provisions of the Treaty of Rome, and the e.c. arrangements generally,indicated that the Community were aware of the difficulty originally encounteredby the Six in the liberalisation of capital movements. M. Harmel had suggestedthat that was a two-sided question and that investors in the Community wouldnot want their thrift dissipated in third countries; but there was not really a parallel,since Britain controlled portfolio investment. It would be necessary for britain to maintain controls over direct capital movements to countries outside theCommunity but only over a transitional period.Portfolio investment presented a more intractable problem. Our presentcontrols meant that a British citizen who wished to sell his sterling shares and transfer the proceeds across the exchanges for the purchase of non-sterling securitiescould do so only by acquiring such shares already held by another British citizenthrough the investment currency market which operated at a discount against
SterlingM. Harmel then invited Mr. Wilson to discuss the question of sterling as areserve currency, as he had apparently done during the talks with General de gaulle in Paris. In the opinion of the Belgian Government there were bothadvantages and disadvantages in introducing a reserve currency into the monetaryarrangements of the Community. Although they did not in any way feel theneed for a reserve currency in the Community they considered the two mainadvantages of introducing sterling lay in (a) the international role of sterling withits monetary, trading and commercial emanations, and (b) the sophisticated financialtechniques of London together with London itself as a great financial centre.These constituted the two positive aspects of sterling as a reserve currency.He then said that Mr. Wilson had been reported as having said in Paris thatthere could be burdens and charges as well as privileges and honours in having a reserve currency. Could Mr. Wilson amplify what he meant by burdens? Forhis own part M. Harmel regarded a reserve currency as also imposing a dual burden,one aspect serious and one less troublesome. Article 108 of the Treaty of Romeprovided a remedy for a national currency in difficulty; but the Article was notdrafted with a reserve currency in mind since none of the members of theCommunity maintained a reserve currency in the full sense of that term. Shoulddifficulties in relation to sterling arise either in a Commonwealth country or in the sterling area generally, if Britain were a member of the e.c., it would bepresumably incumbent upon the other members of the Community to help toshoulder the burden. It was therefore important for the British Government toindicate at the present stage how they envisaged that such a situation might develop.Secondly, if in the long term a single currency were to become a desirable featurefor an integrated Community, the existence of sterling as a reserve currency withinthe Community might be a factor complicating this development. There appearedtherefore to be a basic difficulty about introducing a reserve currency into theCommunity on which the views of Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be welcome.normal exchange rates. The discount served as a deterrent. To free the movementof portfolio investment would create a channel for British investment via theCommunity to third countries and Belgian experience did not provide a completeanswer to the potential difficulty which he foresaw. Britain possessed awell-developed capital market; France was currently developing one and to thisend had recently liberalised her capital movements. Mr. Wilson gave as an example of the kind of difficulty he had in mind the position of a British financier,linked with a United States company and with connections in the various monetarycentres of Europe. Without strict controls money could flow out quickly from london via the e.c. to the United States by virtue of the normal bankingarrangements. This was a problem which the Community had not yet tackled.A solution might be found by providing, in agreement with the Community, thatinvestment currency should be obtainable at a lower rate of discount or through control of portfolio investment in e.c. countries. But these were problems fordiscussion by experts in financial matters.M. Vanden Boeynants recognised that a real problem existed here both forBelgium and for many other members of the Community, although not on thesame scale as for Britain. It was too technical to discuss in further detail at thepresent meeting although it was clearly necessary for it to be looked at by theCommunity whether Britain were to join or not. In his view the problem wouldbe no more difficult to solve if Britain were a member than if she were not. Itwas a matter for experts and should be left to be dealt with accordingly.Mr. Wilson, in agreeing with M. Vanden Boeynants, added that the risk hereto Britain was open-ended; at the same time, however, it must be recognised thatthere could well be an inflow of funds from the Community into Britain as wascurrently the case although the continuance of this situation could not be relied upon. Article 70, sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of the Treaty of Rome provided forthe Council of Ministers to co-ordinate action to prevent undue capital movementsbetween members of the Community and third countries. In view of these provisions the question would be one for discussion between the British and belgian Governments and other Governments in the Community; the commission should also be associated with the discussion.
Mr. Wilson said that his remarks on sterling should not be treated as the viewsof an expert. To say that sterling was a privilege and an honour which had to bepaid for was an incorrect report of what he had said in Paris. He had said thatthere might be some members of the Community who would think that there wouldbe prestige in having a reserve currency. Britain did not think so. We looked on it as a banking problem with assets and liabilities. Bankers found themselves in difficulties if their liabilities had all to be met at one time. He did not think that hewas betraying any confidence (since the series of talks was a continuing one) insaying that President de Gaulle had not taken a stand on the prestige argument.It might be useful if he said something about the role of sterling and sterling balances. In the first place, sterling was the currency of Britain and of her trade as the franc was of Belgium. Sterling was liable to be weak if the United kingdom balance of payments was weak, and it was to the balance of payments of member countries that Article 108 of the Treaty of Rome referred.Sterling was also a reserve currency but that was not a matter of prestigeor honour. Sterling had acted as a reserve currency for members of theCommonwealth just as, in a similar way, the French franc had been a kind of reserve currency for former French territories in Africa. He supposed though he did not know that the Belgian franc had played a similar role in relation to thecurrencies of Belgian former colonies. The fact that a currency was a reservecurrency was usually a stabilising factor. Several countries still kept in Londonsubstantial sterling balances for the purpose of guaranteeing their own currencies.Sterling was also a trading currency. When confidence in sterling had beenlow, some international financial and trading organisations, firms and currencyspeculators had run their sterling balances as low as possible but, with the renewedconfidence in the pound, they had been increasing their sterling balances. Somespeculators who had sold sterling in the summer of 1966 were now obliged to buy it back at a higher price. Sterling was used not only by those who needed workingbalances in order to settle their trade accounts but also by those who acceptedsterling for settling third country transactions in which neither Britain nor sterling area countries were involved. For example, an enterprise in an Eastern Europeancountry might buy goods from South Africa and settle its account in sterling.Sterling was used in this way as a trading currency like the dollar and like certain other European currencies which were coining to be used more regularly as tradingcurrencies. It was no secret that the French franc was being developed as aninternational trading currency.It might be suggested that, if sterling balances were reduced because tradingcountries and large enterprises ran down their working balances of sterling, thiswould create dangers for the Community, if britain had been admitted as a member,since, under Article 108 of the Treaty of Rome, something might have to be done to support sterling. There might be a fear that Britain would have to deflate and,as a member of the Community, drag the other member countries into deflation.But an analogy with the case of Italy when the lira had suffered from Italy&apos;s weakbalance of payments-was inexact for the following reason.Even in periods of currency crises, sterling balances remained remarkablystable. Since the last war they had remained at a figure of around  4,000 million.It did not suit the convenience of countries with large sterling balances to run them down; indeed, in July 1966 sterling balances had risen instead of fallen. Moreover,protections were afforded by the Central Banks who worked together in order to avert sterling crises. In 1966, the Central Banks of Europe, including the BelgianCentral Bank, had helped to keep the sterling balances very steady.Under the Basle Agreement, to which Belgium subscribed, pressure on sterling could be dealt with by pooling arrangements. This was a matter of regular monetary co-operation which was quite distinct from the Common Market.Furthermore, if sterling area countries reduced their sterling balances, we still hadsubstantial assets; our overseas assets substantially exceeded the level of sterling balances.
TechnologyIn Belgium the Prime Minister was responsible for the co-ordination of scientific and technological development. He had therefore been glad to read the statements on technology made by Mr. Wilson a few months earlier and afew days before the present meeting. In technological and nuclear matters the structure of European development was disappointing. There was greatdifficulty in doing things in common because of the individual interests of France,Britain and Germany, who preferred bilateral to multilateral co-operation. Atpresent, a number of separate initiatives were under discussion. For example,President Johnson had established a commission charged with the task of looking at the reasons for the backwardness of technological development in Europe by comparison with the United States. A second initiative had been provided bySignor Fanfani&apos;s proposals for European or NATO collaboration in technology.The third initiative came from Belgium. He proposed that there should be ameeting at the end of February or in March of European Ministers of Scienceto discuss the problems of disparity in technological development andknow-how &quot;. The lag between the United States and Europe was becoming more and more disquieting. In 1966, M. Harmel had proposed in Paris theestablishment of European co-operation, separate from the United States, intechnology and space research. But Mr. Mulley, who had then been the british minister of Aviation, had not given the proposal a very warm welcome. InJuly 1966 he had himself proposed the establishment of a European group for the exploitation of space satellites; again the British reply in November 1966 had notbeen very encouraging.   Britain had a great contribution to make to EuropeanIt was impossible for him to forecast the nature of any arrangement that mightbe reached with the Community on the future of the sterling balance system. he saw no cause for anxiety on the part of the Community in view of the substantialoverseas assets we held. But if our friends in the Community invited us to join,we could discuss the matter of sterling balances with them, although no problemarose because our assets exceeded our liabilities.Various proposals had been made to fund the sterling balances and pay themoff over a period of perhaps 50 years. That was a proposition which could befurther considered although there were some inherent defects in M. Debre&apos;suggestions. Other suggestions included one that the International monetary fund (IMF) should take over liability for the sterling balances. This was a questionwhich could not be examined at the present meeting but might be looked at bythe Group of Ten and the IMF. If the question of assets and liabilities could beput in a European context, the British Government would be prepared to discussthe matter with the Community.As regards the question what would happen if, in the longer term, theCommunity were to create a single European currency, the answer was that this wasnot ruled out by the British Government. Indeed, it might be more acceptable to Britain than to certain of the present members of the Community. It waspossible that a way could be found of combining a single European currency withfunding the sterling balances which might put an end to anxiety about their future for the rest of the 20th century. The fundamental point, however, was that the sterling balances could not be said to be a threat to the stability of the Communityif Britain were to join it.M. Vanden Boeynants said that Mr. Wilson had given a very clear expositionon sterling. The Belgian Government had noted the explanations he had given and the stand he had taken on matters of principle. It should now be easy torefer the matter of sterling balances to the experts for further consideration if need be. M. Harmel had mentioned certain questions but he should add thatthere were other possibilities and other arguments being deployed in Belgiumabout the place of sterling in the world which had not been touched on in thepresent discussions. Mr. Wilson had given clear answers and the result hadbeen substantial progress towards understanding. Unless there were expertspresent who wished to comment on sterling, he proposed that the discussion should now turn to questions of technology and Europe&apos;s lag behind the UnitedStates in technological development.
technological development and it could only reinforce the position of those whowanted to see her in the Common Market. He would like to know what theBritish view would be of the proposition Belgium would make at the meeting inFebruary. If the Six had agreed on a co-ordinated policy, they would inviteBritain to join them in developing this initiative. He would therefore like toknow whether Britain would regard a technological community as distinct from,or the same as, the Economic Community.Mr. Wilson said that he had noted with interest that M. Vanden Boeynantswas personally responsible for the co-ordination of science and technology.When he himself had formed his Administration in October 1964 he had established a new Ministry of Technology. Its task was to be responsible not for pure science but for the application of science to industry. It controlledthe Atomic Energy Authority and was responsible for such industries asengineering, electronics, machine tools, motor cars and, most recently, aircraft.Its direct employment of industrial scientists and technologists was about thelargest in the free world outside the American Department of Defense. As PrimeMinister, he himself chaired a committee of Ministers concerned with science and technology.Turning to the initiatives which had been mentioned, he said that Britainwelcomed Signor Fanfani&apos;s initiative because, like M. Harmel&apos;s it put the questionof technology on the European map; technology had been neglected for too longin our international arrangements. But Britain doubted whether NATO wasthe right place for this initiative for reasons which it was not necessary to go intoat the present meeting.As regards M. Vanden Boeynants&apos; own initiative, he thought that it wouldbe a good thing and that Britain would like to participate in it if it bore fruit and if it led to further scientific and technological discussions between the six and Britain. Co-operation on space research and satellites must, like all otherexpensive projects, be properly evaluated for cost effectiveness. Britain played a full part in ELDO and ESRO, but in satellite technology Europe could only hope to limp a long way behind the United States and the Soviet Union.Expenditure on such costly projects must necessarily be a matter of priorities.European backwardness had been mentioned. If there was one area inwhich Europe was backward in relation to the United States, it was in theapplication of science to industry. He believed that, in pure science, Europe had as fine a record as any country in the world but fell behind in applying it to industry. He had often referred in his speeches to the tragedy of discoveriesworked out in British laboratories (and he had no doubt that the same appliedto European laboratories) being applied to practical use in the United States.As a result, Britain and Europe had to pay the United States royalties for thedevelopment of their own ideas. With this in mind he had established theMinistry of Technology in order to modernise -British industry and to applyscience to industrial processes.Both in his speech at Strasbourg and at their morning discussion, he had referred to the computer and aircraft industries which were costly in research and development; if the results of the research and development could be soldonly in a small national market the expenditure involved would not be worthwhile. Two years earlier, the British computer industry faced destruction at thehands of the United States computer industry. He had therefore asked theMinister of Technology to ensure that the British industry should be saved. Ithad now become viable and was indeed launching itself into Europe in competition with the American computer industry. By contrast, France, as he had mentionedin Paris the previous week, now had no independent computer industry. Thesame would be true of many other industries. Co-operation between europe and Britain would be needed if we were to be competitive with the United States,If we did not co-operate, we should be second-class producers turning toconventional out-dated tools and machines and depending increasingly on theUnited States for the modern tools of industrial advance which it would beimpossible for us to develop independently in our limited market. 180 millionconsumers in the Common Market could become 280 million if Britain andcertain other countries joined the Community.  These greater figures would
allow us to compete on equal, indeed on more than equal, terms with the UnitedStates. Britain for her part was ready to engage in talks on technologicalco-operation but at the end of the day technological co-operation would not succeed if the countries involved remained economically independent.Co-operation could only be effective if we had a joint market without tariff barriers.During their discussions in Paris, Mr. Brown and he had been told thatbilateral collaboration would still be feasible even if Britain did not join theCommunity. The costs of research and development would be halved and the markets would be doubled but in respect of collaborative projects on aircraftthere was an assured market in the French and British armed forces. The samedid not apply in the civil field. Willingness to co-operate in bilateral technologicalprojects would lead to very little, unless there was an enlarged market for theresults of collaboration. In other words, technological advance and thedevelopment of the Community went hand in hand.The question posed by M. Vanden Boeynants whether there could be a fourthcommunity devoted to technology was a matter for those charged with the directionof the three existing Communities. There might be a case for superimposing it onEURATOM, which had been a slight disappointment. If the three Communitiesbecame fused into one, it would probably not be sensible to have a separatetechnological commmunity: instead there could be a technological arm of thefused community. Just as in Britain the Ministry of Technology aimed to integratetechnological development and industry, so in a Community that included Britain there would be advantage in technology being integrated with the rest of the workof the Community.M. Vanden Boeynants said that he was particularly happy at what Mr. wilson had just said because it coincided with his own policy on technology. He agreedthat, if technology were to be applied profitably to industry, a market bigger thana national one was essential. For this reason, technological co-operation was avery live issue in Europe. He agreed that a market of 280 million consumerswould give Europe a chance to compete with the United States and the soviet union. If Britain gave a favourable answer to the proposal that she should examine, together with the Six, the problem of the technological lag behindAmerica, the discussion would not necessarily be limited to a mere exchange of views but could include the possibility of integrating markets. If Britain were amember of the Community, much of the preliminary work in creating atechnological community would have been done in advance.Mr. Wilson observed that Britain and the United States worked together fortechnological advance, and the American Presidents and his own Chief ScientificAdvisers collaborated closely. Nevertheless, our interests differed from those ofAmerica in building up European technology.ConclusionM. Vanden Boeynants observed that God helped those who helped themselves.Before adjourning to a more restricted session in order to continue the talks heldafter dinner on the previous evening, he wished to say how grateful the BelgianGovernment were to Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown for visiting Brussels andexchanging views so frankly; he thanked all those who had taken part in such a positive, if brief, discussion. It had been a pleasure to welcome Mr. Wilson toBrussels for the first time and he hoped it would not be for the last time.Mr. Wilson thanked all those who had helped the progress of the talks and expressed his gratitude to the Belgian Government for their hospitality and for making so much time available for discussions. The talks had been brief but very thorough and represented an important stage in the series of talks with the heads of Government of members of the Community. At the end of the tour,Britain and the Six would have important decisions to take. Britain would haveto consider the experience of the present members of the Community and when,as he hoped, negotiations for entry to the Community took place, Britain would bewell prepared and many of her problems would have been eased as a result ofthese informal talks.The meeting adjourned at 6 p.m.
RECORD OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER ANDFOREIGN SECRETARY AND BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER and belgian FOREIGN MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGNAFFAIRS ON WEDNESDAY, 1st FEBRUARY, 1967, AT 6 p.ni. &apos;Present:The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, mp        M. P. Vanden BoeynantsThe Right Hon. George Brown, mp        M. P. HarmelH E Sir Roderick Barclay Baron J. van den BoschSir Burke trend sir Con 0&apos;neill mr. A. N. HallsMr. A. M. Palliser&quot; Building Europe &quot;: Further discussionM. Harmel said that he would like to pursue a little further the suggestion which M. Vanden Boeynants had mentioned to Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown intheir private discussion on the previous evening. The feeling which had promptedthis proposal was that, if there was mere stagnation so far as the developmentof European political &quot; construction&quot; was concerned, this might create, oraggravate, an internal problem in Germany. This was something to be prevented,if possible; and the Belgian Government therefore wanted to be assured that anystep which they took to advance the development of some kind of politicalstructure in Europe would not be in a direction of which the British Governmentwould disapprove. It was for this reason that M. Vanden Boeynants had askedwhether the British Government would see any objection if the BelgianGovernment ventilated with the rest of the Six the idea that, as regards a limitedlist of subjects (which would exclude military questions), it might be possible topromote between all the countries with a European &quot; vocation&quot; someunderstanding or agreement that they would take no action as regards subjects in this list without prior discussion and, if possible, agreement between themselves.The possibility of economic collaboration with Eastern Europe was one example of the type of subject which might figure in a list of this kind.If this idea was to be launched, however, it must be a serious idea, in the sense that the understanding or agreement which it envisaged must be serious inintention and the subjects on the list must be serious in nature. Subject to thisproviso, however, the proposal could be a valuable test of the goodwill of thoseinvited to take part whether they were members of the e.c. or not towards the concept of a further move towards political unity in Europe. But, if the BritishGovernment had doubts about the whole project, the Belgian Government would think very carefully before they took any action. Meanwhile they had consultedHolland and Luxembourg; but they had said nothing to the Italians or in Bonnor in Paris.Mr. Wilson said that he noted and appreciated the confidential nature ofM. HarmeFs remarks. He would like to ask two questions:(a) Would the subjects on the list be exclusively European in nature; or would some of them extend beyond Europe, to include issues arising in, e.g., Africa or the Middle East?(b) Had the Belgian Government any inkling of the probable French reaction to their proposal?M. Harmel replied that, as regards Mr. Wilson&apos;s first question, the BelgianGovernment had not yet defined the list of subjects with any precision. All thatthey knew was that it must be short the whole enterprise would be an experiment and must therefore not be too ambitious at the outset. But anotherexample of the type of subject in mind would, be the preparation of a Europeanposition on some issue to be discussed at an international conference. In this sense the subject matter need not be exclusively European.
Mr. Wilson intervened at this point to add a third question. Would thecountries who would be associated with the e.c. in this enterprise include, orPYrlude those European countries which were politically neutral and were not members of NATO ?M. Harmel replied that he could perhaps answer Mr. Wilson&apos;s second andtnjrd questions together. So far as the French attitude was concerned, theBelgian Government had long since stopped consulting the crystal ball. Hecould say, however, that on a recent occasion in Paris an idea of this general character that he had put forward had been reasonably well received byM. Couve de Murville. That was the only olive branch to which he could point;he could not forecast the final French attitude.He continued that all progress towards greater European political unity mustbe on a coherent basis aiming at a total result. Because it must be coherent, itcould to-day include only Western, and not Eastern, Europe. But, if it was tobe total it must to some extent cover defence. It followed that all taking part inprogress towards such unity must be prepared to play their part in the common defence. This meant in turn that neutral States, if they wanted to play their part,must give up their neutrality. The conclusion he reached was that the processwould have to be started more or less on the basis of the European members of nato.Mr. Brown said we would like to think about the Belgian proposal. Hisimmediate feeling was that the kind of project M. Harmel was contemplating mightoffer too many people too much opportunity for delay. But he would like to thinkit over.Mr. Wilson remarked that to some extent what M. Harmel was proposingwas, in spirit, like the Belgian Prime Ministers recent proposal on technology.Part of the purpose, it seemed, would be that not only the Six but others too should begin working together to prepare for the day when they could all act togetherfrom within a single organisation. This seemed in principle a good idea.Meanwhile he would be grateful if the Belgian Foreign Minister could give himsome idea of what he expected the results of the meeting of the Six in Rome to be.He himself had said the night before that he hoped this meeting in Rome wouldnot lead to an agreement to embark on a search for political union which mightdelay our entry, perhaps for a long period. For some people might want delay.Mr. Wilson concluded that the British Government must think over what. Harmel had proposed. They would no doubt meanwhile want to go ahead;and he hoped they would keep us in touch.Mr. Brown enquired whether M. Harmel thought his rather limited plan wouldreally have much appeal to the German Government. But yet, if a more ambitiousplan were evolved which might appeal to them, would it not risk opening up too many complications?M. Vanclen Boeynants summed up with three points. First, whether theseproposals would appeal to the Germans only they could say., Second, it would be most unwise to put forward such an initiative unless it was sure of success. It was for this reason that the Belgians thought of trying to persuade the Germans to put the idea forward, since they thought it would have a better chance of success ifthe Germans did so. Therefore, all Six, including the French, must be agreedbefore the meeting in Rome to move ahead on this basis. Third, Mr. Wilson&apos;sanalogy with his proposal on technology, was not quite exact, though pretty close.The Belgian Governmenfs objective with this political proposal was to give both germany and Europe a psychological shock. But the motive underlying histechnological proposal was present, too; for, if the Six passed on their proposalto Britain, and Britain accepted it, then this would constitute a large positive factor in favour of British accession to the Community. He could in any case assureMr. Wilson that the Belgian Government were determined not to allow an enterprise of this kind to develop in such a way as to threaten delay to the possibilityof British entry to the Community.   ;M. Vanden Boeynants concluded that it was natural that the BritishGovernment should wish to think over the Belgian Governmenfs proposal. Buthe hoped that they would be able to give a reaction very soon. For he did notthink it was likely that the Belgian Government would wish to go ahead withoutBritish approval. That was why they had not yet mentioned their ideas to theGermans, Italians or French, but only to their Benelux colleagues, the netherlands and Luxembourg.SECRET7719 k
RECORD OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTERAND THE FOREIGN SECRETARY AND MEMBERS OF THE e.c. and EURATOM COMMISSIONS, AT 21 AVENUE HENRI PIRENNEBRUSSELS, ON WEDNESDAY, 1st FEBRUARY, 1967, AT 2.30 p.m &apos;Mr. C. M. MacLehoseMr. A. M. palliser mr. N. StathamForm of negotiationMr. Wilson said he would welcome the opportunity of a more general discussion to follow up the separate discussions which he and Mr. Brown had had with the Commissioners during lunch. He wished to enquire what theCommissioners thought of the desirability of an eventual resumption of our formernegotiations as opposed to our making a.new application. Mr. Brown added thatif, when Her Majesty&apos;s Government came to decide their next move in the lightof the discussions currently taking place, they took a decision to go ahead, thetabling of a new application would be a matter of some considerable importance.We would not wish to risk a second veto. To resume the suspended negotiations might be an alternative. He did not say that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would wish to do this but merely enquired whether they could do so. Dr. Mansholt saidthat this was a juridical rather than a political question but, in his view, speakingpolitically, he thought it would be difficult merely to resume negotiations. Hepersonally would be against a resumption; the political decision taken by her majesty&apos;s Government in these circumstances would, he thought require a new start.Mr. Wilson agreed that a major political decision would be involved but hewould like to know what the juridical position would be. If we were to join theCommunity we should carry out our obligations to the full. We would not thereforewish to start off in a bad juridical position. But he thought that Mr. Brown was right in that, if a new formal application were made and we were rebuffed once again, it would be very difficult to contemplate a third attempt. Would it not therefore be better to resume the suspended negotiations?M. Marjolin agreed with Dr. Mansholt. If we said we wished to resume negotiations he was not sure that the psychological reaction would be good on thepart of all the Six. Each of the Six would wish to have a say in the decision.Mr. Wilson suggested that perhaps his purpose in raising the question had beenmisunderstood. Certainly we would only negotiate if we thought there was agood prospect of getting in. But we would like to be able to start the negotiationwithout stumbling over the juridical objection that we had taken the wrongdecision as to resumption or a new negotiation. Mr. Brown said that much would depend upon what we knew of the real intentions of the Six by the end of thecurrent round of discussions. We knew generally the attitude of the Five. Wewere less certain of the French attitude. If we could be certain of that, then her majesty&apos;s Government could take their decision and it would perhaps not mattergreatly whether a resumption or a new negotiation were asked for. If there were however a large area of uncertainty, then we might have to choose between a formof pre-negotiation, which he personally would not like, and risking an applicationwhich might be turned down. The point was that if we made a new application and were turned down, we might be driven into other courses.Present:The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, m pThe Right Hon. George Brown, mpSir James MarjoribanksSir Burke TrendThe Hon. Sir Con 0&apos;neill mr. A. N. HallsM. Pierre ChatenetDr. Sicco MansholtM. Robert MarjolinM. Jean ReyM. van der GrooteDr. Axel Herbst
Dr. Mansholt repeated his view that a fresh start would be better since hethought that to resume negotiations would bring out all the old files and dossiers,even though, he agreed, not everything in them still had to be regarded asapplicable.Mr. Brown agreed that perhaps, since we did not wish to go into the samedetail as in the 1961-63 negotiations, there might be some advantage in startingafresh; much would however still depend upon what one knew of the probableoutcome. Mr. Wilson enquired whether the Community had any legal adviceindicating whether a resumed or a new negotiation was more appropriate.Mr. Chatenet said that both possibilities were open from a juridical standpoint.It was quite clear that in 1963 the negotiations had merely been suspended. Thedecision was therefore a political one. M. Rey added that certainly the 1961-63conference had pnly been adjourned, and could be resumed. If resumed, it wouldprobably have to begin immediately at varying levels, both of experts and Ministers.But he wondered whether at the end of the present round of discussions, if it seemed that a reasonably satisfactory solution could be expected, we would findeveryone ready to negotiate immediately. There might still be some problemsrequiring further discussion before a proper negotiation could start. Mr. Wilsonsaid that this brought us back to the question of a pre-negotiation. We wouldcertainly not wish to embark on a formal negotiation if the spirit of any of the six suggested that at the end of the day we would still not be able to enter theCommunity. We had made clear that we wanted to treat this question as a matterof high political importance. His own and Mr. Brown&apos;s visits to Communitycapitals showed that we had it in mind to deal with the question on a politicallevel without becoming involved in minor technical detail. We wished to maintainthe political momentum and did not want long technical negotiations at any level.If some things still remained to be overcome, he and Mr. Brown might need to renew their approach. He was sure that General de Gaulle recognised thatwe were treating the question as a political one.M. Marjolin said that he could see no significant difference between a resumption and a new negotiation. In either case, if we failed, there would beextreme discouragement. If we resumed and failed it would be difficult to envisagea second resumption. The big question was whether after Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had evaluated the present round of discussions we could apply fora negotiation or whether further conversations might be required. Dr. Mansholtadded that, even though Her Majesty&apos;s Government might say that they wishedto resume negotiations, the Community might prefer new negotiations. Thisquestion could conceivably be discussed in a pre-negotiation.General problemsMr. Wilson said that we were still not half way through the round of visits to community capitals. The problems however seemed to be (a) agriculture and the Commonwealth, which had many aspects, but thecentral difficulty in which was the financial regulation. AmongCommonwealth aspects New Zealand was perhaps the most important;(6) capital movements;(c) problems which we ourselves did not see as difficulties but which werein the minds of other members of the Community, such as the sterling balances and the role of sterling as a reserve currency. He felt sure that the difficuties here resulted from a misunderstanding of the realposition; and Id) possibly, regional policies.But in addition to all these he thought there was a feeling among some of the six that the Community was now a cosy, nicely arranged organisation, the serenityof which could only be disturbed by the advent of ourselves and some other efta countries. Their thought was that to widen the Community would be to weaken it.We contested this view. If the Community were regarded as a train, it was our intention to add more coaches and provide a more powerful locomotive. we certainly did not intend to tear up the tracks or change the signals. He wondered whether the Commissioners would care to comment on this aspect.Mr. Brown added that the issues were clearly narrowing. He agreed that the sterling problem still required to be fully understood and that, as understanding
grew, it would be seen to be less of a barrier. Finance arrangements under theCommon Agricultural Policy were also a difficulty. But the problem which mr. Wilson had mentioned was perhaps beginning to bulk largest in importanceSome in the Community perhaps felt that the accession of new members would only present fresh difficulties. The question was really whether the community should be open to new accessions or whether the Community was frightened ofadditional members.Dr. Mansholt commented that there were different points of view within the six, The Six had had plenty of difficulties in the past but they were now boundtogether. But his opinion was that if the Community were not expanded then the only alternatives open to it were to make association arrangements with othercountries or to establish a kind of free trade area. These alternatives seemedto him to present a greater danger than the expansion of the Community.Certainly the accession of new members would bring with it the need for a newrunning-in period. After that the political development of the Community might perhaps proceed. His own attitude was therefore that the Community shouldexpand; he thought there was no real choice.Mr. Wilson enquired whether Dr. Mansholt implied that perhaps a periodof associate membership might be necessary as a transition to full membership.We ourselves thought this would be totally wrong. But he judged rather that dr. Mansholt felt that the Community would be weakened by a number of looseassociations not by a number of additional countries becoming full members.Dr. Mansholt confirmed his view that a series of associations would be extremely dangerous to the Community, thought there, were some cases whereassociation would be necessary, e.g., Switzerland and Sweden.M. Rey added that the Community had faced the same problem in 1961; theCouncil of Ministers had taken a favourable decision to negotiate, not only with ourselves but with Norway, Denmark and Ireland, for full membership. But hethought the most important&apos;aspect was the strength of the Community&apos;s institutions.If a community of ten members or more worked on the basis of unanimous voting,then the Community must become like the OECD. If, on the other hand, theCommission were able to continue the exercise of the power provided to it underthe Treaty of Rome, and majority voting were the rule, then the Community could continue to develop...... Mr. Wilson commented that whatever obligations we undertook we should certainly carry out within the Community.M. Rey repeated that, compared with all the other European organisations-OECD, Council of Europe, WEU, even Benelux the Community was only one&apos; able to carry our strong policies; this was because of their strong institutions. Itwas necessary to maintain the dynamism of the Community.M. Marjolin said he thought that if Britain established links with theCommunity it should certainly be in the form of full membership and notassociation. The Community would certainly be&apos;strengthened by our accession.He was sure his colleagues would agree. But there was a problem arising fromthe mechanical difficulties of running a larger Community including not onlyourselves but Ireland, Norway and Denmark. These difficulties increased in ageometrical progression as the number of members grew. On top of this therewould be the difficulties of making arrangements for the association of all other european countries. Once Britain was in it would be impossible for theCommunity to discriminate against anyone in Europe. Arrangements would haveto be made for Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Portugal and Spain. Any association in turn limited one&apos;s freedom of movement, and he thought the danger of theCommunity&apos;s degenerating into something like the OECD which had been ableto deal only with trade and commercial problems, but to make no further significantprogress was a real one.AgricultureMr. Wilson said he thought that, as time was drawing on, it would be as well to discuss the agricultural question.Dr. Mansholt said that, although the Commission had had definite views in1964 on the shape of a definitive arrangement for Community agricultural financing,

an agreement had only been made to the end of 1969. This was the arrangement under which 90 per cent of the levies were transferred by member States to theCommunity, and the short-fall made up according to a fixed key. From 1970onwards the only thing decided as regards the financing of the Common agricultural policy was that the levies would be part of Community funds to be used for community purposes (Community regulation No. 25). There was nothing decidedabout charges on member countries. All that was firm was that levies had to goto Community funds and member countries could not retain them themselves.This was partly because it was obviously impossible for example for the dutch government to retain levies on imports into Rotterdam destined for consumption in Germany. The Community would have to negotiate In 1969 (perhaps startingin 1968) the post-1969 regulation. He hoped that the Community would in anycase bring Britain into any negotiation. It would not be wise of the Six to makea further regulation and then have a subsequent negotiation with Britain.He would give some figures based on a Community expanded to include notonly Britain but Denmark, Norway and the Irish Republic. He calculated thaton the basis of contributing 90 per cent of levies our payments would amount to$685 million. But the 90 per cent limit had been agreed only up to 1969. If alllevies were transferred our contribution would be $760 million. The Commissioncalculated for a budget of $1,800 million for the Guarantee Fund. To this would need to be added about $100 million for interventions in Denmark, Norway, etc.,$285 million for the Guidance element of the Fund, and some expenditure in thearea at present covered by the European Coal and Steel Community say a totalbudget of $2,200 million.He calculated that Britain would pay 35 per cent of the total budget, Germany20 per cent, France 20 per cent, Italy 12 per cent, others smaller amounts. [It isnot possible to build up a coherent picture on the basis of the figures Dr. Mansholtquoted, but his figure of 35 per cent for the British share of the total fund seemsto relate to levy payments alone, and to exclude any additional payment under a fixed key; though this is hard to square with what follows.] His own calculationalso showed that if 90 per cent of levies were transferred and we paid nothing underthe fixed key we would still be paying 34 per cent. He did not want to draw anyconclusion from these figures; but anyone could easily draw their own.Mr. Wilson said that we would not be likely to get much back from theCommunity&apos;s Agricultural Fund, so that there would be little compensation in thefield of balance of payments. He would be interested to know how far we might expect to get help from the Community for production grants for hill farmers.But surely a split of 35 per cent, 20 per cent and 20 per cent between the three main contributors produced an intolerable situation.Dr. Mansholt nodded his assent and commented that the arrangement of 90 percent transfer of levies plus a fixed key was suitable only for the Community of Six.M. Marjolin enquired what would be the proceeds from the levies once Britainand the other EFTA countries were inside the Community.Dr. Mansholt replied that at present levy income from the Six was calculated to amount to $590 million. Because some of their present imports came from denmark, Britain and Ireland, and these would not be leviable after the entry of these three countries into the Community, there would be a reduction of around$70 million in the amount raised in levies by the Six. Britain would produce about$760 million in levies, Denmark and Norway each about $20 million. This produced a total of $1,300 million towards the estimated budget which he had mentionedearlier of $2,200 million. The figure of $760 million which he had quoted for britain took into account the fact that some imports which Britain currently tookfrom third countries would be switched to Community sources.Mr. Wilson said that we already produced 13 million tons of cereals and imported 7 million tons to cover our consumption of around 20 million tons. Wecalculated that by 1971-72, as members of the Community, with prices at theirpresent levels, we would need about 23 to 24 million tons of cereals (some of theaddition attributable to increased requirements for feeding stuffs) of which wewould produce about 20 million tons, importing only 3 to 4 million tons.The meeting concluded at 3.20 p.m.

He considered it agood omen that Mr. Wilson should be the first head of Government to visit Bonnsince he had taken office as Federal Chancellor.Mr. Wilson expressed his thanks and suggested that there were one or two questions other than the Common Market in particular his conversations withthe Russians the previous week which could be discussed perhaps after dinner.Herr Brandt suggested that representatives of both sides might meet and discuss two other matters at some point during the day: (1) non-proliferation and(2) tripartite talks between the Federal Government, Britain and the United states on the offset problem.Mr. Wilson agreed. The main object of the talks would of course be theCommon Market issue, and on this he wished to raise a question of procedure.Should he first give an expose of the problems as he saw them and talk about theprevious visits which Mr. Brown and he had made and should there then bequestions and comments on the German side, particularly on the more importantproblems and on the likely reactions of Germany&apos;s partners in the e.c.? Hewould like to have the advice of the Federal Government on tactics, particularly as regards timing and method of approach.Mr. Wilson then rehearsed his view of the issue. With the full authority ofthe Cabinet, he had set out the British position in the House of Commons on10th November, and he had said that we meant business in, our approach to theCommunity. This statement had been very quickly welcomed by the federal government. There were some difficulties, but these could be overcome; he feltthat the first three visits which had taken place had reduced these difficulties. Somestill existed, but these were not as formidable as they had seemed previously.Some of the biggest problems to which answers would have to be found were inthe agricultural field; the Common Agricultural Policy&apos;s financial regulations would probably present the greatest difficulty. Regional policies in Britainprovided another but less worrying problem. There were still big Commonwealthproblems, but there was a will to solve them and there was a great deal of understanding on the part of the Commonwealth countries. Public opinion in britain backed the Governmenfs policy and the EFTA countries were also at one with the British Government, although he was, of course, not speaking for theother EFTA countries. There were admittedly some reservations on the part ofsome EFTA countries, but in general they were in full agreement with the Britishinitiative. Over the past three or four months the emphasis in Britain had shiftedfrom the economic to the political aspect of joining the Community, which hehad stressed in his Strasbourg speech and which could be summed up in threewords: unity, strength and independence. The order of these words was of no particular importance because they all went together. If Britain joined theCommunity, she would not weaken it but would strengthen it. If she proved able
to join, Britain intended to carry out the obligations of the Treaty of Rome; theTreaty of Rome as such offered no obstacle to us. The British Government feltthat their own adhesion to the Treaty of Rome and that of at any rate some ofthe other EFTA countries would deepen and widen the cohesion of Europe; itwould certainly not weaken Europe either economically or politically. On thecontrary it would be a source of strength, by creating a larger market and wideningtechnological knowledge. This was something which Britain could contributeand which Germany also contributed. Mr. Wilson instanced the scope for thedevelopment of technological co-operation in the field of civil and military aircraft, which would also make Europe economically more independent of theUnited States. Politically Britain had the same feelings towards the United states as the German Government had. We were just as attached to the Atlantic Allianceas the German Government, but we drew a distinction between the United StatesGovernment on the one hand and American business on the other.We believed that, if we could build up Europe,.this would help to reduceEast-West tension. The German Government had recently taken importantinitiatives in this direction. If we could achieve this detente, Europe would be ableto play a bigger role in world affairs and in the United Nations.The British Government had not yet taken a decision whether to negotiateto join the Community nor would they until the visits to European capitals were completed. We knew that there were various difficulties in the minds of someGovernments of the Six. But so far he and Mr. Brown had been encouraged bythe results of their visits, including the one to Paris. They had not hoped to open the door there but they felt that they had managed to dispel some of the difficulties and misunderstandings that had existed there previously.Mr. Brown said that there had emerged a few areas in which Britain would need to ask for more than a transitional arrangement. One case was New Zealandwhere some permanent arrangement would have to be made; another was theamount of the agriculture levies. The transitional periods would differ in lengthaccording to the issues involved. We should feel easier if we could be assured that there would not be a veto on our application for membership of theCommunity.Germany&apos;s attitudeDr. Kiesinger said&apos; that his Governments attitude was well known. Theyhad made it quite clear in Paris that they desired British adherence to the EECfor a variety of reasons. But they felt obliged to ask the question which all thosemust ask who wanted full European union, in economic, social, agricultural andother fields, namely whether Britain had the same will as the others to advance the European Economic Community to full economic union and to all that thatimplied. Matters had developed beyond the letter of the Treaty of Rome andit was the firm intention of the Six to move on from the stage of a customs union to that of an economic union and finally, although this was not a matter of activediscussion at the moment, to political union. If was still open whether such a union would take on a federal or confederal character. The question thereforewas whether Britain was as fully determined as the members of the community to reach this goal. He repeated that Germany wanted Britain to join the eec and wanted her to join with the will to reach a full implementation ofEuropean economic union.Mr. Wilson said that the answer to that question was clear. He had said inParis that we envisaged joining a developing Community. Nothing was staticand he believed that General de Gaulle recognised that a static Communityimplied death and decay. Therefore we must go forward. Our position was thatwe wanted to join the Community as it was and to go forward with it. TheCommunity was still in a transitional stage, being in effect a free trade area with many aspects of a Common Market, but it was not yet complete. As regardsthe merger of the three Communities, our position was that, if by the time wenegotiated to join there were still three Communities, we would join the three;but if the three Communities merged at an early stage, we would join the mergedCommunity.We would contribute to it our technological knowledge. By this he did not mean that a separate technological Community should be set up. , A case might
be made for adding a fourth Community or perhaps modifying EUR ATOMaccordingly; but it would obviously be more sensible to have one Community witha technological bias. The Communities must move forward and Britain wouldnot be amongst those who would be trying to hold them back. Logic and historytaught us to recognise that, wherever there had been close economic union, ithad led on eventually to political union of one form or another. Just as the speed of a naval convoy was regulated by the slowest ship, so the progress of theEuropean Economic Community would depend on the slowest member. We didnot propose to be the slowest member. However it was too early to envisagewhat the situation would be in 10 years&apos; time. By then the tension in Europemight have eased. Both Britain and Germany had recently made strenuous efforts to reduce tension. If their efforts bore fruit, it would make people more politicallyconscious of the European idea. Britain wanted to get on to the Communitytrain, wanted to make sure that it was going in the right direction and wanted to help to drive it.The French attitudeMr. Wilson said that, speaking very frankly, he could say that, at the half-waymark in the tour of Community capitals, much would depend on the german governments influence in Paris. Britain did not want to put any strain onFranco-German relations (to which she attached great importance). We all hadtoo many memories of the past to forget the importance of those relations. he believed that France was now anxious to have Britain close to Europe but was probably not yet ready to go all the way. Germany&apos;s influence could be decisive.In Paris President de Gaulle had said that he had been much impressed with theearnestness of our desire and he felt that we were now ready to moor the british ship alongside the European quay. This was an important move forward from1963 when General de Gaulle had said that Mr. Macmillan&apos;s Government wasnot ready to do so. At any rate there seemed to have been a development inGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s conception of our thinking. The idea of mooring a ship toa quayside did not convey the idea of full integration but at any rate it seemedto be a step in the right direction.All those to whom Mr. Brown and he had talked so far, including theEuropean Commission, had been very helpful. But they felt that perhaps in theCommission and in one or two of the Member Governments there might be a feeling that after 10 years of development the Community had turned into a cosyfamily home which newcomers might upset and which, if they were admitted to it, might never be the same again. Perhaps that was why General de Gaulletalked of a new house. Some of the difficulties over Britain&apos;s admittance mightbe due to a resistance to change rather than to anything else.Mr. Brown intervened to say that the Federal Government could help usin discouraging any search for some new solution. General de Gaulle had suggested association, but we had clearly rejected that idea and we felt that, ifwe could enter the Community during the present flexible world situation, this might enable Europe to have a greater impact on world events.Dr. Kiesinger said that his Government had had long discussions with theFrench about Britain&apos;s desire to join the e.c.. He had himself raised the subject,had drawn General de Gaulle&apos;s attention, to our declaration of policy, and had informed him that he had received a letter from the leaders of German industryurging him to support Britain in her initiative. He had also told general de Gaulle that it had always been Germany&apos;s objective to include Britain in the eec. General de Gaulle had then put forward his point of view firmly andenergetically and had repeated all his arguments against Britain&apos;s entry at thepresent moment. He had spoken with great friendship and with respect of Britainbut had said that Britain and some of the countries she would bring in her wakemight well destroy the essence of the Community which might be reduced to no more than a free trade area. This was admittedly possible but France, like herrlVe Partners&apos; wanted a real Community, and General de Gaulle did not believehA ,tain would accept all. the implications of that. Since then Dr. Kiesingernad learned with great interest that, as a result of Mr. Wilson&apos;s visit to Paris,general de Gaulle was now convinced of Britain&apos;s serious will to join Europe,inis was decidedly a step forward.  As to the possibilities of the influence which
Germany might bring to bear on French policy, and especially on general de Gaulle, he had explained German opinion on these matters to the General. Ithad been his intention from the beginning that nothing should be left vaguebetween France and Germany as had unfortunately been the case in the past.There were differences of opinion between the French and German Governmentsover NATO, the stationing of troops on German territory, and the entry of britain into the Common Market. On these three issues the French and german governments had noted that they were not in accord in the communique issued at the end of their talks. Nevertheless the French and German peoples couldwork together politically despite these differences of opinion. This was a significant development because, since the conclusion of the Franco-Germantreaty of friendship, a great deal of misunderstanding had arisen because their relative positions had not been made sufficiently clear. Revived Franco-Germanfriendship was a tender plant which had to be treated with great care, not only because of the importance of their relationship to the two countries themselves,but also because these relations were of importance to the whole of Europe&apos;.It remained to be seen how the French and Germans could set about the questions on which they did not agree. The issue of British entry into the e.c. was onewhich he hoped would not last for ever.How could the Germans exert an influence in Paris? He did not believe thatthey could impress General de Gaulle by attempting to bring pressure to bear on him, for they knew his personality and how strongly he felt about certain things.Nor did he think that it would be good for Germany to exert much pressure so soon after overcoming the unpleasantness which had existed between France andGermany. But his Government could try to convince the General by producinggood arguments in support of the British initiative, and by examining with theFrench whether their genuine anxieties were justified or whether they could bedispelled; and whether a way could be found for Britain&apos;s accession withoutdestroying the Community (as the General seemed to fear that it might). The moreGermany could fulfil the hopes which the French placed in improved co-operationwith her, the better would be the chance of her arguments succeeding.On the other two points of difference with France, namely NATO and the stationing of troops on German territory, there was no need to negotiate becausethe facts had been established and there was no more to be said. But this thirdproblem of Britain and the e.c. would be more difficult because a genuineagreement with France must be achieved. Nevertheless the German Governmentwere ready to do all they could in this direction with the necessary insistence and patience.Mr. Wilson agreed that an attempt to exert pressure either in publicdeclarations or in private contact might prove counter-productive. The important thing was to convince General de Gaulle on the points about which he was concerned. We had found him to be receptive to new facts. The fact that Britainproduced 13 million tons of cereals per year and imported only 7 million tons hadimpressed him, since he had thought that our production was far smaller. he realised that, if Britain joined the Community with prices at their present level, wewould probably produce 20 million tons by 1971; but we would still import about million tons because of livestock development.On technological co-operation General de Gaulle hoped that bilateralarrangements such as we had in the field of military aircraft would continue; but mr. Wilson had told him that there was a difference between military co-operation(when Governments agreed to buy certain equipment) and civil technologicalco-operation where private business came into play. The General had seemedimpressed when Mr. Wilson had explained to him that technical co-operation and market integration must go hand in hand, and that there must be no barrierbetween markets. General de Gaulle did not seem to feel that our military situation was as difficult a problem as it had been in 1963. He still had some reservationson this score but there was a big difference between his present and his formerattitude largely due to the fact that in the next few years the Royal Air force would be using Anglo-French aircraft and helicopters. The present situation was thus very different from what it had been at the time of the Nassau Agreement.Dr. Kiesinger said that the position was clear but it worried him a little. TheGerman impression in Paris had been that French resistance to British entry had
been very strong; since Germany was only now beginning to get back to normalityin her relations with France, it would be difficult to get deeply involved incontroversial matters. On the other hand he realised that Mr. Wilson andMr. Brown had started their round of visits with a great deal of energy and thatBritish public opinion would expect to see some results. Therefore they musttogether try to devise some means of filling any gap which might arise betweenthe end of the visits and any further development, in case French resistance wereto continue. Perhaps some sort of European committee could be set up to ensurethat there would be no hiatus. It would be intolerable, not only for as great and important a country as Britain but &quot; for all of us, and I repeat all of us &quot;, if theexperience of 1963 were to be repeated. Something should therefore be devised for the period after the end of the visits to the Six which would give the impression that things were being kept on the move.Mr. Wilson agreed that it was very important to consider seriously what todo after March. The ideal would be to begin negotiations for entry. Eut if this did not prove possible, the momentum must be kept up. Britain must certainly not be barred again, because to be barred twice might well have fatal consequences.At present public opinion in Britain was very largely in favour of our going into europe; but, if we were to find the door barred&quot;again, great pressure might bebrought to bear on us for some alternative solution, perhaps the Javits Plan or some Atlantic and Pacific Community. We had naturally considered all these possibilities but had come to the conclusion that we preferred the Europeansolution. If we were now made to abandon it. it might well be difficult ever to launch the idea again.Mr. Wilson said that even worse might happen. The existence at the presentmoment of the e.c. and EFTA side by side meant that there was a certain divisionor barrier in Europe but there was no hostility. It might be that a spirit ofcompetitiveness he would not use the term &quot; trade war &quot; might enter into therelations between the two groups. Some of the EFTA countries were alreadysuffering to a certain extent from the Common Agricultural Policy which was not strictly in accord with GATT; but because it was understood that a wider, fullereconomic union was the ultimate aim nobody had so far raised any objection.&apos; this situation, however, might change.Proposed &quot; Summit&quot; meeting of the Six FusionHerr Brandt said that Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown should know about twoevents which might cause some anxiety in London. The first was the meeting to be held in Rome to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the e.c.. It had beensuggested that this might give rise to certain developments which might rendermore difficult the present British initiative. He did not think that that would be so.The most that was likely to result was a series of inter-gqvernmental meetings which would not prejudice anything. The second was the proposed merger of thethree European Executives which would probably take place in 1967, even beforethe summer. If it did, two more years would be needed to bring about the fusionof the Treaties, even leaving aside the problem of British entry. Therefore in preparation for German talks with the French and for the talks of the Five withthe French it would be important to get as many points as possible cleared that afternoon in order to produce a sound basis for further talks especially on agriculture.Dr. Kiesinger said that General de Gaulle had told him that he was not anxiousto attend the impending meeting in Rome simply to participate in a birthday party.Something of real political substance would be needed to justify his attendance.Later he had said, on a suggestion from M. Couve de Murville, that it might bepossible to discuss various matters informally and without an agenda, perhaps witha view to Foreign Ministers continuing these talks later. General de Gaulle had agreed to a rapid merger of the Executives either as a result of the meeting in rome or soon after. This merger, and the timing of the British negotiations, wereimportant because even outside France there were those who said that it mightbe better not to allow this merger and the British negotiations to overlap. If itwere a question of the Communities merging, rather than the Executives, thatwould take much longer.SECRET7719 L 2
Mr. Wilson said that it was important not to expect all the final details ofdecoration of the house to be completed before we moved in. We could do much of it together and, if we were in the Community, we could help in manyways, especially in the technological field.Kosygin&apos;s visit to the United kingdom mr. Wilson then asked how the Federal Government felt that his talks withMr. Kosygin affected the common purpose i.e., entry into the Community whichhad brought them together in Bonn that day. It was his impression that theGerman Government desired to bring about a detente in their relations with eastern europe, provided that none of Germany&apos;s vital interests were impeded. that being so, relations with the Soviet Union were all important. France had good relations with the Soviet Union, different but parallel to our own. Both possesseda special nature and British-Soviet relations could be helpful to Germany. on several points Mr. Kosygin had been rather more flexible in private than in his public statements, although perhaps not so much on Germany. Britain had now established extremely good relations with the Soviet Union but in so doing hadnot given away one single German interest: and in achieving this the foreign secretary had played a great part. How far did German Ministers think thatAnglo-Soviet rapprochement could be either an obstacle or a help in our approach to the Common Market? We had established ourselves as a kind of intermediary between the United States and the Soviet Union on certain matters on which itwas difficult for them to talk directly (e.g., on Vietnam). We therefore felt that onthe German question we might be able to explain the Federal Governments attitude to the Soviet Union. This might not impress them the first time but perhapsby the twentieth it would have made a certain impression on them. He had talkedat length to Mr. Kosygin about our Common Market problems and had foundhim most relaxed about them, by contrast with the Soviet attitude in 1962 whenthe Common Market was regarded in Moscow as an invention of the devil.Mr. Kosygin had not indicated that he had any grave misgivings about our accession,although he had said that on the whole he was against the Common Market. Hehad hinted that the Soviet Union might encourage Finland to establish closer relations with the e.c., but on Austria his attitude had been different.Dr. Kiesinger said that he had not had time to study reports on Mr. Wilson&apos;stalks with Mr. Kosygin in this respect. Any step towards a relaxation of tension between the West and the Soviet Union accorded with the Federal Governmentswishes, provided that the German problem was not lost. He was not sure whetherthe Soviet Union&apos;s previous hostility to the Common Market might not havebeen based on misgivings about the future stage of a political union and possibly a defence community. The advent of the non-proliferation treaty might haveremoved some of the Soviet Union&apos;s anxieties, because they felt that, once sucha treaty existed, the Community would be only a Common Market or an economic unit and would never become a military or political entity, constituting a threat to the interests of the Soviet Union. It was possible that the Soviet attitude to the Common Market would be different if there were no non-proliferation treaty.The meeting ended at 11.35 a.m.
RECORD OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTERAND FOREIGN SECRETARY AND THE FEDERAL german chancellor AND FOREIGN MINISTER HELD IN THE PALAISSCHAUMBURG, BONN, ON WEDNESDAY, 15th FEBRUARY, 1967,AT 3.30 p.m.Present:The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, m p,      Dr. Kurt Georg KiesingerThe Right Hon. George Brown, m p,      Herr Willy BrandtH E Sir Frank Roberts Dr. Werner KnieperSir Burke Trend Herr Rolf LahrThe Hon.

ReidMr. R. Lederer (Interpreter)Dr. Kiesinger welcomed the Prime Minister and his party. Ministers had had a full and fruitful exchange of views in the morning, and would now continue their discussions with experts present.Background to the United Kingdom initiativeMr. Wilson agreed that the morning discussion had been fruitful; severalquestions had been discussed which might now be examined rather more fully.It might perhaps be helpful if he were to put on record some of the points he had made in the morning and then to amplify what he had said about the british governments intentions in making the current series of visits to the capitals ofthe Six and about the problems which they foresaw in considering applying for entry into the e.c..The German Government were already aware of the statement he had madein the House of Commons on 10th November, 1966, since they had made a friendly and speedy reply. They would have had reports of the discussions during the visits Mr. Brown and he had paid to Rome, Paris and Brussels. Their purpose invisiting Bonn was threefold:(1) they wanted to enquire whether Britain&apos;s essential interests could be safeguarded if she joined the Community;(2) the British Government would have to decide whether to activatenegotiations and, if so, what timing should be adopted for their approach to the Community; and(3) the British Government looked to the German Government for advice on how to overcome the problems which existed in the minds of theGerman Government and of the other Governments which were members of the Community.Behind all these enquiries was a firm intention to enter the Community if our essential interests could be safeguarded.Mr. Brown and he spoke for the British Government, for the great majorityof those in Parliament, in industry and in Britain as a whole.   Although they
naturally did not base their views merely on public opinion polls, it was a fact that recent polls showed a substantial majority in Britain in favour of entry into theCommunity. A recent study made by the Confederation of British Industry had reached the same conclusion.Although he was not empowered to speak for other EFTA governments and would certainly not wish to give the impression of speaking on their behalf, theBritish intention to undertake soundings had been welcomed at the Decembermeeting of EFTA Governments in London.As he had made clear in previous speeches both in Strasbourg and on othervisits to Community capitals, Britain&apos;s motives were both political and economic.There was no doubt that it would be to our advantage economically for us tojoin the Community. He thought there would be little doubt that it was to theeconomic advantage of Europe to have Britain in the Community. Both sideswould wish to see the deep division of Europe healed.He wanted to set out the main reasons why the problems of entry confrontingBritain, the Six and Europe had to be overcome. Their common objective was the unity, strength and independence of Europe. These were all closely linked and hewould not give them in any order of priority. Independence did not mean cuttingEurope off from other parts of the world. If the Community admitted Britain andother members of EFTA, Europe would have strength to assert herself in suchinternational groupings as NATO or the United Nations or in any other international forum. Like Germany, Britain was a strong believer in the atlantic alliance. If Britain joined the Community, the European side of the atlantic alliance would, in economic terms, become more independent. A strongereconomic Community would be created, since the membership of the presentCommunity of 180 million would become 280 million if Britain and the othermembers of EFTA were to join. This would provide the biggest single market in thefree world indeed, China apart, it would be the biggest single market in the world.An enlarged Community would provide opportunity for the industries of all its members. If Britain entered, she would bring not only consumers, but alsoproducers with a wide range of expertise in science and technology. But the opportunities for technical progress this would open up would only be fully realised if there were a single market. It was possible that some governments might suggest enlarging the number of bilateral co-operative projects withoutbringing Britain into the Community. But in the view of the British Governmenttechnological co-operation implied having an integrated market in which the technological achievements of all the member countries would be pooled and through which their products could be marketed.The unity, strength and independence of an enlarged Community wouldmoreover be of great political advantage in easing international tension. He haddeployed this argument the previous week during his discussions withMr. Kosygin. Mr. Wilson added that Dr. Kiesinger and his Government had ina few weeks made strides towards achieving a. detente in Europe. It was truethat the German Governmenfs overtures had not always been received in thespirit in which they had been made, but they should not worry about beingrebuffed in certain quarters since real progress had been achieved. France hadfriendly links with the East; so had Britain with the Soviet Union. Mr. Kosyginhad told him that he regarded the previous week&apos;s discussions as a high watermark in Anglo-Soviet relations. Detente must be a prerequisite of the solutionof many of the problems which had been created for Europe as a result of thelast war. Political strength would promote the political unity of Europe and increase the power of all the countries of Europe to speak together in internationalmeetings on matters of world concern. As he had said in Strasbourg, and as mr. Brown and he had said on all their visits, important though the economic consequences of any negotiation for entry to the Common Market might be, thepolitical consequences transcended them. He wished to stress the need to maintainthe momentum of the last few months. If Britain were denied admission to the eec and if long negotiations had taken place before she were told of that decision,a grim prospect would face Europe and the Community would be the poorerfor Britain&apos;s absence. Such a decision would set in motion forces which couldnot easily be arrested and which would put into reverse the process of unificationwhich had been started by the Community.   Among the results might be the
necessity for Britain to consider the possibility of some other grouping such as an atlantic Free Trade Area, or alternatively of maintaining our own positionregardless of the Community which had rejected us. Either of these solutionswould be less satisfactory than Britain&apos;s entry to the Community, or rather to thethree Communities. The proposal to merge the three Communities was far advanced and Britain would be prepared to join either one merged community or three separate Communities. If one merged Community were to be created,Britain would be glad to join in helping the other members develop it. Britainconsidered that an enlarged Community would be a source of strength, not of weakness and the admission of new members might help to solve some of theproblems already confronting the existing members. For example the problem of majority voting would become easier both mathematically and politically ifBritain and some other members of EFTA had joined the Community. Theiraccession would also help the Community to be outward-looking, as he understood the German Government wished it to be.The reasons for choosing the present time for a renewal of our approach to europe were over-riding, and for both sides. It was necessary not to losemomentum, because there were important decisions to be taken about thefuture of the Community which it would be advantageous both for Britain andthe Six to take with Britain as a member of the Community. It remained to beseen how, when the British Government had decided formally to activatenegotiations for entry, she should go about it and at what time. Britain soughtentry to the Community, provided that her interests could be dealt withsatisfactorily. In his speech to the House of Commons on 10th November hehad said that, having examined in depth every aspect of the Treaty of Romeitself, of decisions taken subsequent to its signature, and all the implications andconsequences which might be expected to flow from British entry, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment took the view that, while there were anxieties on the point, theTreaty need not be an obstacle if our problems could be dealt with satisfactorily,whether through adaptations of the arrangements made under the Treaty or inany other acceptable manner.Problems of United Kingdom membershipThe main problems which would confront Britain arose from:(i) the Common Agricultural Policy and especially the financial regulations made under it;(ii) the Community&apos;s directives and rules dealing with the freedom of capital movements;(iii) relations with the Commonwealth, chiefly in connection with agricultural policy and trade;(iv) the effect on Britain&apos;s regional policy of the rules and conventionsformulated under the Treaty of Rome.There would of course be other problems as well as the four he had just listed;but these appeared of a lesser order of difficulties and on their previous visitsMr. Brown and he had learned enough to enable them to think that these problems were not as formidable as they might once have appeared to be.It might now be helpful to discuss the four specific problems in rather more detail; and he would welcome any comments which the German Government hadto make. The present discussions formed part of a series of six which should beof far-reaching importance for the future of Europe. He did not think that britain was asking for anything which would weaken the Community or the rules whichhad been drawn up under it. Indeed, Britain&apos;s entry and that of her partners, whilstaltering the structural features of the Treaty of Rome would indeed strengthen theCommunity. Britain was only seeking to safeguard her own interests in the same way as the founder members of the Community had safeguarded theirs during theperiod of the Community&apos;s formation. He had mentioned in the morning the high cost of technological innovation which was an argument for enlarging the size ofthe Community. The economic strength which the accession of Britain and othermembers of EFTA would bring would contribute to the political unity of Europe.Dr. Kiesinger thanked Mr. Wilson for what he had said in the morning andtor his impressive statement of the will of the British Government and people that
their country should become a member of the European Communities. Whenhe, Dr. Kiesinger, had observed that the development of the Community had gonebeyond the text of the Treaty of Rome, Mr. Wilson had answered his question bydeclaring that it was the British Governmenfs intention if admitted to theCommunity, to join with other members in the development of Community policiesleading towards economic union through for example, common trade, socialtransport and monetary policies. Mr. Wilson had left him and his colleagues in nodoubt that Britain would follow this road once she had become a full member ofthe Community. This had been the most important of the German questions andit had been clearly answered. Herr Brandt would deal with more specific problems in order to clarify for the German and other Governments the difficulties which britain might meet, and to help her over them.Treaty of Rome TechnologyHerr Brandt said that it would help Germany and the other members of theCommunity if Britain could confirm that, in her desire to enter the Community asa full member, she proposed to do so on the basis of the Treaty of Rome and of allthe decisions taken under the Treaty since it had come into operation. Was Britain,in speaking of adaptations of the Treaty and of protocols to it, referring to changesother than the essential institutional ones arising from, e.g., the need to provide thenew member with voting rights? Had she any views on the question of majorityvoting? He understood that this question had been raised in visits to other capitals.Would Britain accept the view of other Community Governments on this matter?As regards protocols, it was well known that some of the present membersof the Community had asked for special treatment at the time of their joining theCommunity. For example, France had wanted special arrangements made forAlgeria and Morocco. Did Britain envisage that it would be necessary to have special protocols for Commonwealth countries other than New Zealand? In the morning Mr. Brown had said that transitional arrangements of varying lengthswould be needed for different items. Could he now indicate the length of someof the transitional arrangements he had in mind?If he understood Mr. Wilson correctly, the technological Community wouldnot be a fourth Community but rather an adaptation of EURATOM or else aspecial limb of an enlarged Community.  Could this be amplified?Mr. Wilson said that, although in November 1966 he had used the term &quot;a fourth Community&quot; and technology was sufficiently important to merit thecreation of an independent Community, it could nevertheless be assimilated toEURATOM in order to improve the performance of that body (which had so far been somewhat disappointing) and promote the further peaceful uses of nuclear energy. But if the three executives were likely to merge soon, it would beinopportune to create a separate technological Community, and the technological development he had in mind could be carried out within a single Community.But he must emphasise that technological co-operation on the scale we envisagedwould not be possible if the United Kingdom was not a member of the Community,because of the need to be able to market technologically advanced projects on asufficient scale to justify the development and production costs involved.Mr. Brown said that the only adaptation to the Treaty of Rome which Britainenvisaged as being necessary was already provided for in the terms of the treaty on the accession of a new member, for example, affecting formal voting rightsand the allocation of contributions. But no other change or adaptation need bemade, provided that the problems which would confront Britain on entry couldbe treated equitably.Similarly we could observe all the rules deriving from the Treaty of Romeprovided that our special difficulties could be given sympathetic consideration.These might best be discussed in relation to the special problems such as capital movements and the common agricultural policy on which they arose.On voting, Britain would conform to whatever decision was acceptable to themembers of the Community. The German Governmenfs view on majority votingmight differ from that of other members of the Community; but it would be wrongand unwise for Britain, so long as she remained outside the Community, to interfere in what was essentially an internal matter.The question of transitional periods should be dealt with under each particularheading in respect of which a transitional period was required.   For example,
capital movements would require a transitional period which might be short or longdepending upon the common consideration of the probabilities of capital movements after our entry. If the consequence was a tendency for portfolio investment to be made from Britain through the Community to third countries such as the United States a longer transitional period would be required; but ifthe tendency were in the other direction, a shorter period might suffice. the transitional period required for the Common Agricultural Policy would have to take account of the development of our agricultural production; the consequences forour balance of payments; and the increase in Britain&apos;s cost of living. AMorocco-type protocol was one of the possibilities for providing a special arrangement to meet the case of New Zealand: but there were others, such as aspecial form of association or of access to European markets.Common Agricultural PolicyDr. Kiesinger said that he hesitated to deal with the problems of the common agricultural Policy since only a small elite understood them well. He had, however,a few questions of special importance:(1) What impact would Britain&apos;s entry into the Community have on the costof living in Britain ?(2) What problems would accession raise for Britain&apos;s agricultural production?He had noted that Mr. Wilson had said that he expected Britain&apos;scereal production to rise from its present figure of 13 million tons tosome 20 million tons in the not too distant future. The problem ofagricultural prices was a delicate one especially in Germany where any suggestion of lowering the prices paid to farmers would be repugnantto farming opinion.(3) What arrangements were envisaged to deal with the effect on commonwealth agriculture of Britain&apos;s entry into the Community?(4) Did the British Government envisage any review of the Communityagricultural policy arrangements, including the financial arrangements,in order to mitigate their effect on Britain&apos;s balance of payments andthe cost of imports?Mr. Brown said that he wanted to make it clear that the Common agricultural policy in itself, like the Treaty of Rome, did not constitute in the view of the BritishGovernment a necessary impediment to entry into the Community, provided thatthe four problems which had just been mentioned were capable of solution. Hewould try to answer the four questions in their ascending order of difficulty.(1) The effect on the British cost of livingThe British Government had introduced a policy of stabilising prices and incomes, and any notable increase in the prices of agricultural produce would tend to damage that policy. If the position did not change when the Communityreviewed their agricultural prices in 1969 and if world prices remained at theirpresent level, it had been calculated that there would be an increase in the priceof food in Britain of between 10 and 14 per cent. If however food prices went downin Britain, or if world prices went up, the situation would be different. Either way,it was clear that much would depend upon the length of the transitional period.If it were short, the policy on prices and incomes could be seriously damaged; if itwere long, the change would hardly be noticed. Something in between wastherefore desirable. He saw the difficulty for the German Government and theCommunity over the level of agricultural prices; but if Britain&apos;s friends recognisedthat she would need a sufficiently long transitional period, all would be well.(2) Distortion of British agricultural productionThis would be a considerable problem. Adaptation to the common agricultural Policy would stimulate the production of cereals and would increasethe already high income of cereal growers in the Eastern part of Britain.Conversely it would reduce the returns of smaller farmers in the West and centre of the country: they presented the largest political problem. They would doubtless try to turn to cereal production but in less favourable climatic conditions.They had less chance of getting a good return from cereals growing, and with
increased feed costs they would tend to lose on their production of milk and beefA social problem would thus be created for small farmers in areas from whichthe Government would not wish them to move; the ensuing structural problem would call for a transitional period during which for example small farmers wouldre-group themselves into larger units by one means or another. The problems raised by this distortion could be solved, first, if Britain were allowed to use someof her large payments of levies to the Agricultural Fund for the making of grants to those farmers who had to adapt their farming to the new conditions. we already had schemes for making such grants, which would have to be regularisedunder the Treaty of Rome. He believed that they could be so regularised; thiswould make this whole problem easier of solution. Second, it would clearly benecessary to have a transitional period in which farmers could make the necessary adjustments.(3) Commonwealth problems in this field there was one problem of real difficulty which could not be solved by a transitional period that of New Zealand. The trading problems presented by Australia and Canada and by the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement could he considered be solved, as could the problems of other Commonwealth countries,possibly in the same way as the problems of former French territories had beensolved. But because of the extent to which New Zealand&apos;s export income and agricultural production depended on access to the British market, the problem ofNew Zealand would have to be solved by a more permanent arrangement such asa Morocco-type protocol, or by a form of association, or by a derogation providingspecial access for New Zealand to the Common Market.(4) Balance of payments the problem which was most difficult of solution was. the charge which levieswould impose on Britain&apos;s balance of payments. If these levies continued to bebased on 90 per cent of the cost of our substantial imports, they would amount atthe lowest estimate to  175 million and at the highest to  250 million. They wouldbe a direct charge on our balance of payments. Figures which we had exchangedwith the Commission of the e.c. led us to believe that these estimates were probably on the right lines. Because our agricultural industry was on the wholeefficient, with rising productivity and a reduced labour force, we were unlikely to recoup from the Fund much of what we paid by way of levies. This meant that we would have to pay in levies a very substantial sum which might be as muchas the combined contributions of all the other existing members of the Community.At present Germany paid a disproportionate share in levies, but Britain would payan even more disproportionate share. This would be manifestly inequitable.Britain would be prepared to pay her fair share, (and he did not wish to arguewhether this should be 90 per cent or some other figure) in 1969 if the size of theCommunity were to increase, but the present arrangements would apply soinequitably to us that it was reasonable to ask that the discussions which theCommunity would be having about their agricultural arrangements in 1969 shouldtake account of the entry of new members, and the size of the Fund and the basis on which it was financed should perhaps be re-examined then. Unless this was done we estimated that we should have to pay, both in levy payments and ingovernmental contributions under the &quot; key &quot; apportionment, some 35 per cent of the total Agricultural Fund equivalent to roughly twice what Germany wouldbe paying.He had stated the problems in ascending order of difficulty; but he consideredthat given goodwill, they could all be solved and that none need be a barrier to britain&apos;s entry into the Community. The solution of each would need goodwill onthe part of our partners and each would require a different solution or solutions-but solutions could be found. After a short discussion on the statistics of the likelycost to Britain of accepting the Common Agricultural Policy, it was agreed thatthese should be explained in a smaller group meeting, and the plenary passed toa discussion of economic problems.Dr. Kiesinger thanked Mr. Brown for the answers to his questions. He askedwhether Herr Lahr had any supplementary points.
Herr Lahr said that a great deal could be said upon the subject of agriculture,but he would limit himself to a few points. First, on the question of the cost ofliving and the price of food. The British calculation that food prices would rise by between 10 and 14 per cent was almost exactly the same as the calculationmade by German experts. But, if this increase were related to the cost of living, itwould be much smaller, because food prices were only a part of the cost of living.Their experts thought that on this basis the figure would be around 3 per cent.If say, a transitional period of six years were allowed, this would mean anincrease of \ per cent per annum and the problem would obviously be greatly reduced. He had no comment on what had been said about the structuralproblem of British agriculture.Mr. Brown agreed that British figures were very similar to German figures and that the problem was manageable if the right transitional period could beobtained, though it might be unmanageable if there were an inadequatetransitional period. It was for this reason that he had said that the problemappeared to be the least difficult of those concerned with agriculture. Mr. Wilsonadded that in the House of Commons on 10th November he had given figures of10 to 14 per cent as the probable increase in retail food prices, and 3 to 3J percent as those for the increase in the cost of living.Herr Lahr said that in connection with the Commonwealth agriculturalproblems we had mentioned various possibilities transitional periods and permanent arrangements which might for instance involve association or a protocol. Transitional periods would of course be easier to agree, and it would greatly simplify any negotiations if requests for permanent arrangements couldbe limited to a minimum. He asked whether we intended that all New Zealand&apos;strade should be covered by permanent arrangements; or could such arrangementsbe limited to specific products such as butter? Mr. Brown replied that of coursehe was not negotiating at the moment, but so long as it was possible to arriveat a situation in which permanent arrangements could be made to cover the bulkof New Zealand requirements perhaps different arrangements for differentsectors-the question could be satisfactorily dealt with. In general he agreed with herr Lahr that the more limited was the area to which permanent arrangementsneeded to apply, the easier it should be to reach an agreement.Herr Lahr said that we had mentioned a range of  175 to  250 million in connection with our balance of payments problem. This figure was again,perhaps by chance, the same as that arrived at by their own experts; but theirown experts calculated that this would be the cost arising not only from theagricultural financing arrangements but from the whole agricultural arrangements of the Community, including the consequential effect of higher import prices. 175 to  250 million for agricultural financing alone seemed to be on the highside. Mr. Brown said that we should be willing to show him the figures uponwhich our estimate had been made. But the point with which he was concerned at the moment was that it should be understood that the problem was an important one. Mr. Wilson added that Herr Lahr&apos;s figures appeared to be identical withthose he had quoted in the House of Commons last year. More calculations hadbeen made since. The figure of  175 to  250 million which he had quoted was our then estimate of the total effect on the balance of payments of accepting theCommon Agricultural Policy. Since then the figures had been further examined,and we had exchanged figures with members of the Commission in Brussels.He certainly thought that in the range of  175 to  250 million the higher figure was likely to be more nearly right, and could be even higher than that.&apos; Dr. Kiesinger said that there would be plenty of opportunity to exchangefigures related to the agricultural costs. It was agreed that the discussion on agriculture could now be concluded.Financial and monetary questionsHerr Brandt said that before Mr. Wilson spoke on the financial and monetaryproblems involved in British membership he would like to make three points:(a) He knew that in other capitals Mr. Wilson had spoken about the recovery of the British balance of payments. He would like to hear about the recovery in more detail.
(b) In connection with the role of sterling as a reserve currency he wouldlike to enquire what Her Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude was towardsArticle 108 of the Treaty of Rome which made provision for assistancein balance of payments difficulties.(c) He knew that Britain had reservations about the freedom of capital movements in the expanded Community. He would be grateful if mr. Wilson could explain them.Mr. Wilson said that the German Government would be aware of the balanceof payments deficit with which the Government had been confronted in 1964amounting to about  800 million. The figure would, in fact, have been ratherlarger if we had not sought relief on the annual payment due on the United Statesloan ( 60 million). The actual deficit in 1964 had been  770 million. This hadbeen reduced in 1965 to  320 million. No final figure was yet available for 1966but the deficit had certainly been considerably reduced. Again, even though wehad gone through a difficult period during the summer partly owing to the seamen&apos;strike, we would in 1967 be in fact in balance and then moving into surplus. Thefinal figures were not yet available for the fourth quarter of 1966 but all the indications were that we should be in balance. We intended to pay off later inthe year the first tranche of the large borrowings which we had had to incur in1964-65. In the past two months the reserves had risen considerably; in additionto published figures there had been substantial repayments of the swap and other arrangements undertaken during the summer of 1966.The trade figures alone showed a considerable improvement. The tradedeficit had been running at  45 million per month in 1964; this had been halvedto  23 million in 1965 and to  12 million per month in 1966. The Germans wouldrecall that, on our trade figures alone, we had been in deficit in every quarter ofevery year this century, but of course figures of invisible earnings needed to betaken into account to correct the picture. Moreover, although he had given annualfigures, there had been a very strong improvement in the second half of 1966,especially in exports. This had been maintained into January. The figure for exports in January was an all-time record. The imports figure was, however, alsohigh because of the effect of the abolition of the temporary import charge at theend of November.To sum up, we expected a strong surplus in 1967 on the balance of payments, asdid Germany; like the Germans we had had to pay the price in terms of a reducedlevel of activity in the domestic economy. Part of the expected recovery in thebalance of payments was dependent upon the policies for reduction of government expenditure overseas, at present running at over  500 million per year, a gooddeal of it in the military sector. He would not enlarge upon this question becauseone aspect of it was to be discussed on the morrow between German and british representatives.Mr. Wilson then turned to Herr Brandfs question about Article 108 of theTreaty. Of course if we became members of the Community we should be inthe same position with regard to Article 108 as the present members, of whomfor example the Italians had had to have recourse to this Article in the past. but so long as one&apos;s balance of payments remained healthy, Article 108 merelyconstituted a form of insurance to which recourse would not be needed. were recognised that it might be in the minds of German Ministers that our position was not only that of a trading country, and that they might have some fear that,since we had a form of banker&apos;s liability in the shape of the sterling balances a run on these balances would place a burden upon the Community as a whole.Even though it was theoretically possible that the position arising from the transactions of the rest of the sterling area might be different at any time fromthose on United Kingdom account he nevertheless thought that in practice the overall effect would depend on confidence in Britain&apos;s own position and in theBritish balance of payments. If this confidence existed there was no problem, andas confidence in the pound grew the effect on the position of sterling mightrepresent a plus rather than a minus factor. He would not say more about sterlingunless there were detailed questions, e.g., about the sterling balances; if there were,he would be happy to elaborate on them, as he had done in Paris and in Brussels.
Capital movements the question of capital movements had been mentioned briefly by Mr. Brownin answering a question upon transitional periods, and Mr. Brown had made theimportant distinction between direct investment and portfolio investment. we saw more immediate danger arising from the Community&apos;s policies under Article67 on portfolio investment than on direct investment. We recognised that thedirectives under Article 67, whilst making a distinction between direct investment and portfolio investment, had provided for similar treatment for both, and asregards both methods and timing. Mr. Wilson explained that by direct investmenthe meant the establishment or purchase of a subsidiary in, e.g., Germany by aBritish parent company; or the purchase by a German company of a Britishsubsidiary. And it was more guesswork than estimation what the immediateconsequences would be of freeing direct investment. He thought that, net, theresult might not be to place too great a burden on the capital account; the results could even be positive; and against any fears of a deficit might be set the expectation that there would be higher investment in Britain from the UnitedStates. The question of direct investment would be a subject to be dealt with inthe negotiations but, by and large, we did not see it as a major problem.Portfolio investment on the other hand would create greater difficulties interms of the potential burden on the capital account, especially in the early yearsof our membership of the Community. At present in the United Kingdom foreign currency was not obtainable at the official exchange rate for portfolio investment in the Community or indeed anywhere outside the sterling area. Investmentcurrency was permitted, but at a premium over the official exchange rate.Investment currency represented the foreign currency proceeds of disinvestment by united Kingdom residents from non-sterling area securities (he would not wishthis simplification to be quoted as the legal position). There was a pool ofEuropean and American securities in which British residents could invest only by buying from a British resident who wanted to disinyest. The present premiumfor investment currency over the official rate was considerably higher than that envisaged in Article 67 and the regulations made under it. Present practice in britain was thus a considerable way from what would be required by theCommunity&apos;s policies. If we had to liberalise our arrangements this would impose a serious burden upon our overseas capital account.A further problem had been referred to in passing by Mr. Brown.Liberalisation of portfolio investment would not only facilitate a substantialfinancial investment at or near the official rate of exchange, from Great britain to, e.g., Germany or France. Because there were no tight controls on investmentsby Community residents in the dollar area or other third countries there wouldbe a strong temptation to use the freedom provided in order to channel fundsthrough to New York or some other centre. This would be an organised traffic;a merchant banker in London would be able to organise in 10 minutes a substantialinvestment in New York through a contact in, e.g., Frankfurt, merely using thecontact as a channel. While he accepted the case for facilitating investmentbetween the United Kingdom and the Community and vice versa he did not seethere was any case for facilitating investment in, e.g., Manhattan which was notonly part of the economic community to which we would all belong but certainlycould not be regarded as under-developed.Mr. Wilson concluded that we saw the question of portfolio investment asa serious problem which would have to be dealt with in the negotiations.Voting procedures AssociationHerr Brandt thanked the Prime Minister for his answers. He had two further points to make. The first was not really a question and he scarcely expected an answer. But, to revert to the question of majority voting---and he had fully understood what Mr. Brown had said on this point the question did not arise from a dogmatic attitude on the part of the Germans; if the Community wasenlarged not only by one but by several additional members then the problem of voting procedures became one of considerable importance for the efficient workingof the Community.Second, the question of association had been mentioned as a possible solution to the problems of New Zealand.   He himself did not think it was the most
practicable one. There were probably better ones. But were we able to say whetherBritain would support association for other countries, bearing in mind thatassociation had been provided for former French territories? He recalled thatNigeria had already obtained association with the Community and that other commonwealth countries were negotiating for it.Mr. Wilson said he would deal with Herr Brandt&apos;s question about the problemthat might arise if not only Britain, but other EFTA countries and there wasthe Irish Republic as well joined in the Community. Clearly changes would need to be made in order to provide voting quotas for new members, and a newfigure for a blocking minority would have to be established. This was exactly the sort of thing we had had in mind in talking about the adaptations to the Treatyof Rome which would have to be made. We did not envisage or expect that the entry of a block of EFTA members would lead to block voting within theCommunity. This was not only very unlikely, but it would certainly be unhealthyand Mr. Wilson foresaw a situation in which, when majority voting was invoked&apos;there would be a rapid change of existing alliances. He could see for exampleDenmark and the Netherlands, or Denmark and Germany, or Germany and theUnited Kingdom voting together according to the subject in question.Mr. Brown in replying to Herr Brandfs question on association, said that inthe last round of negotiations a variety of arrangements had been provisionallyagreed upon, which would have provided for association for some commonwealth countries and differing arrangements for others. We would assume that these arrangements could be carried over, and the problem of African, Caribbean andAsian Commonwealth countries could be dealt with in this way.Credits for the Soviet ZoneHerr Brandt said he wished to raise the only purely national question whichwould come up. His British colleagues would know the Federal government&apos;s policy on improving the living conditions in the part of Germany on the other sideof the Eastern frontier, by developing trade and cultural relations, etc. TheGovernment in East Berlin was not co-operative at the moment. But, in this difficult time, inter-zonal trade had great importance as an instrument for achieving better living conditions in Germany, and in order to help the federal republic in their policy, their partners in the Community had made arrangementsinvolving the volume of State-guaranteed credit to the Zone Government.Denmark had also said that she was prepared to co-operate in an arrangement ofthis kind. The German Government would be grateful for Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s sympathetic consideration of this point.Mr. Wilson said that he was aware of the problem and understood the FederalGovernmenfs concern with this matter on both human and economic grounds.He understood that the problem related to the length of credits accorded to the zone Government?Herr Lahr here interposed that the volume of State-guaranteed credit ratherthan its length or period, was the particular point of concern.Mr. Wilson said we would like to hear more of the German position before being able to comment. It would be desirable to exchange figures in order to giveproper consideration to the question and we should be ready to do this. Heassured Herr Brandt that we wished to be co-operative, and that we entirelyunderstood the problem of the German Government. But the British Government,for its part, was under heavy attack from industrialists, not only from those whothought that East German trade was an easy way to make money, but fromhighly responsible industrialists who did a great volume of trade in the world asa whole. They tended to argue that the British Government stopped their undertaking business with the Soviet Zone, and that West German businessmengained the trade for themselves. He again assured Herr Brandt that we recognised the problem and repeated that he thought figures should be exchanged concerningthe volume of credits extended.Procedure for following dayDr. Kiesinger said that he would have a few more general questions to raise,which he thought might be dealt with on the following morning.  He proposed
therefore that there might be a further restricted meeting at 9.30 with a plenarylater if time permitted. Were there any further questions which should be dealtwith in the present meeting?Mr. Wilson said he agreed with Dr. Kiesinger&apos;s suggestions on procedure.He thought it desirable that there should be at least a short plenary on the following morning, in order to put on record those things which needed to be recorded. but before concluding the present meeting he would like to mention briefly two other points.Regional policies the first concerned regional policies. Our position was that we had dealtwith this question exhaustively in discussions in other capitals. We had wanted to hear from some of Germany&apos;s Common Market partners who had similar problems to ours, what their experiences had been of operating regional policieswithin the Community. We had no problem to raise with the Germans on this score unless they wished to have it discussed.Kennedy round the second point was the Kennedy Round. We attached the greatest importance to the successful outcome of the Kennedy Round, and had been at great pains in other capitals to make clear that the United Kingdom governments position on membership of the Community did not imply that they attributed anyreduced priority to the Kennedy Round or that they believed anybody shouldslacken their efforts. On the contrary we believed that the need for progress inthe Kennedy Round was reinforced. Since the round of talks with the Communitybegan the final deadline on the Kennedy Round had come one month nearer, andwe were more and more concerned whether the urgency of coining to a settlement on the Kennedy Round was generally understood.Herr Brandt said that the Federal Government was determined to do everything possible in Brussels, Geneva and elsewhere to bring the Kennedy round to a successful conclusion. He personally was very much impressed by the talkshe had had in Washington with the President and others during the previous weekwhich had shown him the nature of the difficulties which could arise if the deadlinewere not adhered to. But in practice the position was that because Britain thought the Community&apos;s offer insufficient, she was threatening to withdraw some of her own offers. He appealed to the Prime Minister for a reconsideration of this position. He thought that the outcome of discussions with the scandinavian countries might lead to a general improvement in the situation. He shared theBritish view that it would be a very unhappy situation if no agreement were reached.Mr. Wilson said he thought the discussion might be continued on the morrow.But he wished to make two points. First we had gone to the limit in our originaloffers and had been disappointed by the results. We had in fact gone to the limitmore than might appear on the surface, in that the figures of trade volume onwhich the offers had been based were figures for 1962, which had been a year of depression in the United Kingdom when imports had been unusually low. Therehad been increases of 30 per cent in our imports of manufactured goods in theperiod from 1964-65 and 1965-66. Although therefore we felt that even on the1962 basis we had gone further than anyone else the 1962 figures under-represented the value of the offer that we had made.Second, there were many countries who, if not satisfied with the outcome,would start attacking some established arrangements which might not be in strictconformity with GATT. Unless there were for instance a satisfactory arrangement on cereals there might be difficulties within GATT. Arrangements which hadbeen allowed to pass in GATT hitherto might be challenged if the concern ofcertain countries were not satisfied; this was a point which needed no enlargement.ConclusionDr. Kiesinger suggested that the meeting might be adjourned at this point andthanked Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown for their great patience and for thethoroughness of the answers which they had given to the questions asked. Themeeting concluded at 6.35 p.m.
RECORD OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTERAND FOREIGN SECRETARY AND THE FEDERAL german chancellor AND FOREIGN MINISTER IN THE PALAISSCHAUMBURG, BONN, ON THURSDAY, 16th FEBRUARY, 1967AT 10 a.m.Present:The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, M p        Dr. Kurt Georg KiesingerThe Right Hon. George Brown, m p        Herr Willy BrandtMr. Lederer (Interpreter) Herr Weber (Interpreter)Non-proliferationMr. Brown said that he had asked the Federal German Minister of Finance,Herr Strauss, to have breakfast with him because he had not been sure whether on the previous night he had fully understood Herr Strauss&apos;s views on aNon-proliferation Treaty; but he had found that the same views seemed to prevailthat morning.Mr. Wilson said that he attached great importance to securing this Treaty.The two officials who had been charged with discussing non-proliferation had made some progress. Sir Solly Zuckerman might visit Bonn to discuss these matters with the German Government. He was very wejl informed on the problem ofnon-proliferation as well as on scientific aspects of the matter and was an experton the problem of &quot; spin-off&quot;. He would not talk about such matters as a european Defence Community but could advise the Germans how far their fearsabout civil technologicl progress were justified or not. Dr. Kiesinger considered this a helpful suggestion. Mr. Wilson suggested that Herr Brandt and Mr. Brownand perhaps also Lord Chalfont might discuss these matters further.Dr. Kiesinger said that Herr Strauss&apos;s attitude on non-proliferation wassymptomatic of a widespread feeling of unease in Germany at the moment whichwas reflected in the German Press. There was a feeling that Germany was tobe downgraded to the status of a tenth-rate Power, not only because of the content of the Non-proliferation Treaty but to a large measure because of the manner inwhich the Treaty had been prepared and then put to Germany. It was generally felt that the ground was being cut from beneath her feet, that alliances were nolonger reliable and that NATO was no longer a coherent entity and was becomingan anachronism. The United States and Britain seemed to be following a differentpolicy from the rest of NATO and it was felt that the German problem wasbeing written off by their allies. This mood was the result of a sequence of eventsover the past years and he did not want to dramatise it.In this context a few words should also be said about the NDP. Only very few of its members were real neo-Nazis. The great majority were no more thanold-fashioned nationalists. If this uneasy mood was now reflected by a man suchas Herr Strauss, who certainly could not be accused of Nazi sympathies, thatwas a sign that the matter must be taken seriously. The German Governmentwould be grateful for any help, especially psychological help, that Britain could give in this respect. It would be very useful if Britain could say that she realised that a great deal was being asked of the non-nuclear Powers and that everything possible should be done to assure them that their interests would be effectivelysafeguarded. When he had referred the previous day to&apos; Mr. Kosygin&apos;s statement,he had done so because he was shocked at the brutal way in which Mr. Kosyginhad expressed himself. When the Soviet Embassy had been asked for the exactform of words used, they had taken some time and trouble and had obviouslyreferred the matter home before giving an answer. Indeed he had begun to hope that the explanation might be found in a mis-translation; and had thusbeen all the more surprised when the Soviet Embassy confirmed the harsh wordsused by Mr. Kosygin, namely that the Federal Republic would have to sign thenon-proliferation Treaty whether it wanted to or not. It did not seem that thosewords had been used without full reflection.Turning to the German Governmenfs policy statement, Dr. Kiesinger saidthat it made quite clear that the Federal Government were determined to pursue
a policy of peace and understanding and would do what they could to reducetension in Europe. True, the first impression of their recent action might havebeen one of aggressiveness, when looked at from the Soviet Zone of occupation and it had caused a certain amount of nervousness in the Warsaw Pact countries;but this was inevitable so long as the Soviet Zone authorities insisted that, before any of the Warsaw Pact countries established diplomatic relations with Bonn,Bonn must renounce its claim exclusively to represent the German nation. Infact their action was not at all intended to be aggressive; on the contrary it wouldsurely contribute to peace. The Federal Governmenfs policy was backed by thetwo large parties in the Bundestag. It had been initiated during the present stage of ferment in the country and no doubt the Government would have some difficulties. He had wanted to give this account, to Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brownafter the talks with Herr Strauss. Nevertheless he himself and Herr Brandt werefirmly resolved to carry the policy through. He was sure that they would succeed;but they needed support, especially psychological support. Germany had had&quot; to take &quot; rather a lot in recent months.Mr. Wilson said that he appreciated what Dr. Kiesinger had said and was grateful for it. If Germany felt that she was sometimes being pushed arounda little, so did Britain. We were being pushed around even by our best friends,who were also Germany&apos;s best friends. It was important that the psychologicalproblem should be stressed. The NDP question gave rise to a certain amountof concern in Britain and to very deep anxieties in the Soviet Union. It wouldbe useful if the British Government could be kept informed of developments inthis direction; Mr. Brown had had to answer questions in the House of Commonsabout this matter, and had done so in a very relaxed manner. It would however be important to educate the Russians on this point and to that end we should welcome all the information we could get. From what Dr. Kiesinger had justsaid and from what Herr Brandt had said briefly on the previous day, the NDPseemed to be a kind of Poujadiste movement. There was something rather similar in the Welsh Nationalist Party which also was a repository for all kinds ofdiscontented persons.As to the philosophy of the Non-proliferation Treaty, Dr. Kiesinger&apos;s remarkswere fully understood and were very much in line with what Lord Chalfont hadbeen told by India, Sweden and other non-nuclear Governments. There was astrong feeling that there should not be a group of &quot; haves &quot; and a group of&quot;have-nots&quot; especially if to be a military &quot;have-not&quot; affected one&apos;s industrial position. In discussion with Mr. Kosygin in the previous year and again theprevious week he had told him that the non-nuclear neutrals felt that, if theywere to remain non-nuclear Powers, the nuclear Powers must scale down theirown armaments and give some kind of military guarantee. Mr. Kosygin had suggested that no nuclear Power would ever use nuclear arms against anon-nuclear Power. This sounded good, but nobody really believed that such anarrangement would be adhered to in war where every side&apos;s only concern was notto be beaten. Mr. Wilson said that he had suggested a kind of collective guarantee to the effect that no nuclear Power would ever attack a non-nuclear one, butthis was difficult for India to accept because of her fear of an attack by China,which would in any case be unlikely to subscribe to such a guarantee. In allthese matters he and Mr. Brown had spoken to Mr. Kosygin in the same way asto Dr. Kiesinger and Herr Brandt there was no question of saying differentthings to different Governments. On the so-called &quot; European option &quot; they had suggested a form of words to the effect that there would be no handover to any european country or group of countries, but that, if at any time a genuine newsovereign State in Europe were to emerge which included in its component Statesan existing nuclear Power this new State would inherit the rights of that existingnuclear Power. In the unlikely event that Canada and the United States becamesomething like the United States of North America, that new unity would inheritthe present nuclear rights of the United States of America.Mr. Brown said that his conclusion from all these talks was that BritainTfould best encourage those who were worried on this count by entering the e.c..If Britain did so, people&apos;s belief in the ability of Europe to stand up for itself would be strengthened. That was why our present initiative was so important and could not be allowed to fail or to suffer long delay. If the Press askedwhether this matter had been raised, he suggested that the answer might be that
it had been raised, but not in the Common Market context; that the expertswere examining it and would continue to do so, with special emphasis on the implications of the treaty for civil technological development in Europe.Dr. Kiesinger suggested that, if the Press put questions on this matter,Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown might indicate that they understood the anxieties ofthe non-nuclear Powers.   Such a statement would have a beneficial effect.Mr. Wilson agreed, so far as the effect on the peaceful development of industry were concerned.German support for United Kingdom entryDr. Kiesinger then recalled that Mr. Wilson, in his speech at dinner theprevious evening, had appealed to the German Government to do more thanjust support Britain&apos;s initiative; he had asked them to do all in their power tobring about Britain&apos;s entry into the e.c.. As Dr. Kiesinger had said, Germanywanted her support to be effective; she genuinely wanted to help, and to be firmin doing so, but she must manoeuvre with caution. It would be necessary for theGerman Government to discuss these matters very thoroughly with their Frenchfriends, to whom they would certainly convey their impressions of the presenttalks, and would try to dispel the anxieties felt by the French about the entry of britain and other countries into the e.c.. But they must set about this carefully,not weakly but with wisdom and prudence. Dr. Kiesinger still hadGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s remarks on this problem ringing in his ears: he had usedvery firm language. Although the task would not be easy, he could give an assurance that as a result of the two days of talks in Bonn the GermanGovernment would faithfully try as honest brokers to overcome the difficultiesin Paris. In the light of this he felt obliged to ask Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto show understanding if the Germans did not make any solemn public declaration.  But they could be relied on to do all in their power in Paris.He was however concerned about what would happen after the tour of the six capitals had ended. He doubted whether the Five would have succeeded in overcoming French resistance by that time. The problem would then arise andit was a worrying one how to fill the gap with reasonable action. The first step might be to await the French reaction to the talks which Germany wouldpromptly begin with France.Mr. Wilson said that he appreciated these assurances and agreed that results were more important than declarations. But he must stress the importance ofmaintaining the present momentum. The British Government were underpressure in the House of Commons both from those who favoured and from thosewho opposed British entry. There was a danger that, if Britain were to make asecond formal application and were to be answered with a second rebuff, this might prove fatal. But there was also the danger of doing nothing, or of standing by thewater&apos;s edge and dipping in a toe but not daring to take the plunge. We must try to keep up momentum while the German Government and others did what theycould to reassure General de Gaulle. There seemed to be two main problems inthe General&apos;s mind. One was the problem of sterling, on which we would let theGerman Government have a note. The second was the feeling that he did not want the present cosy, comfortable little Community disturbed by strangers.Herr Brandt said that he doubted whether it was wise to have multilateraldiscussions on British entry at this stage before some further progress had beenmade in various bilateral talks. In the first place the German Government would consult with Paris. A high official would be going there the next day, he himself would meet M. Couve de Murville in Brussels shortly and the Federal chancellor would be going to Paris again. Secondly the Anglo-German economic commission might be upgraded and carry forward the discussion of this point.All this would enable the German Government to give Britain useful advice.Moreover, even if big words were not used, the German Government wouldunderline where it stood on the European issue in the Bundestag debate thefollowing week.   One difficulty was that he would be meeting several of his
colleagues on subjects not immediately connected with the present talks, first in brussels and then in Rome in April where Mr. Brown and he would be inconnection with WEU.Mr. Brown said that most of the British Press that morning said that theFederal Government had been discouraging towards Britain. This would not help to maintain momentum.Dr. Kiesinger in reply said that there had been three courses open to hisGovernment:(1) They could have said that they were in favour of Britain&apos;s entry whilethe French were against it. This they could not say because theyhonestly wanted to help Britain.(2) They could have used very strong words of support and assurance. This,he was absolutely certain, would have spoilt things in Paris. He knewthis from his talks with General de Gaulle.(3) There therefore only remained the attitude which in fact they were taking,namely: they were impressed by the British arguments which had confirmed them in their intention to support Britain&apos;s endeavours; andthey would talk to the French in this spirit.This was the best the German Government could do in the circumstances and Britain should realise this.Mr. Wilson said that in this connection he had instructed his own PressSecretary who wanted to publish his speech after dinner on the previous eveningto omit the sentence in which he had appealed to the German Government because he felt that, if this were publicised, it could be counter-productive. The sentencemight get out none the less because there had been very many persons present.If asked, he would say that in private talks German Ministers had clearly stood bytheir previous public declarations. If asked whether he had appealed for help inParis, he would say that what one Common Market Government said to another was none of Britain&apos;s business.Kennedy RoundThere was one small point he wished to add in connection with the kennedy round. The list of exceptions to our offer amounted to 5 per cent of industrialimports eligible for most favoured nation rates. The Community list amountedto 18 per cent. This gap needed to be closed. Britain would much prefer to closeit through further Community offers than to withdraw her offers. What Herr Brandthad said the previous day about Scandinavia might be useful in this context.Herr Brandt said that the Anglo-German Economic Commission should meetto consider what the two countries could do to get things moving.OffsetMr. Wilson said that he also wished to mention the offset question. Therewere bipartite talks about it in Washington that day and tripartite talks wouldtake place the following week. It was a very grave problem for Britain as well as for Germany and he hoped that it would not lead to any loss of friendship. Britainmight have to take serious steps if Germany could not help her (which germany might not be able to do). Those who had an interest in sowing discord betweenthe two countries must not be allowed to benefit from this opportunity. We mightbe forced to carry out a surgical operation and should approach it with the properdetachment and not bludgeon each other in the process. Among various ideasbeing suggested the Foreign Secretary had one which involved a forward look atGermany&apos;s aircraft purchase programme.Mr. Brown said that Herr Brandt had been right in saying that the time might come when we would have to make certain reductions and that these should bemade for rational and not for irrational reasons such as money. We must try tofind a solution on those lines.Mr. Wilson said that Mr. Kosygin had been less encouraging in the recenttalks on the mutual reduction of forces. Possibly he had read so much about our unilateral plans for reduction that he felt that there was no need for him todo his part; possibly also he was trying not to upset the Soviet Zone authorities.
Visit to London by Herr BrandtMr. Brown said that it would be good if Herr Brandt could visit London a:soon as possible after Mr. Kosygin&apos;s visit and certainly before Mr. Brown&apos;s visito Moscow in May.Herr Brandt suggested April.The Ministers then went into plenary session.RECORD OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTERAND FOREIGN SECRETARY AND THE FEDERAL german chancellor AND FOREIGN MINISTER HELD IN THE PALAISSCHAUMBURG, BONN, ON THURSDAY, 16th FEBRUARY, 1967,AT 10.35 a.m.Mr. T. Lloyd-hughes mr. D. J. D. maitland mr. N. StathamMr. J. E. D. StreetMr. W. K. ReidMr. R. Lederer (Interpreter)Prime Ministers summing-upMr. Wilson said that he and Mr. Brown had just concluded a useful discussionwith Dr. Kiesinger and Herr Brandt and they had agreed that a short plenary session would be desirable in order to set down the points which they had discussed.They had briefly discussed non-proliferation&apos; on a bilateral basis. He had suggested that a British scientific authority, qualified to discuss the relation between atomic research for military use and the &quot; spin-off &quot; for other uses, should visit Germany and talk to some of the Federal Chancellor^ advisers; he thoughtthat. Sir Solly Zuckerman might be the adviser in question. Dr. Kiesinger andhe had agreed what should be said to the Press if this question were raised at thefinal Press conference.As regards the importance his visit to Bonn might have for the discussions between the members of the Six about Britain&apos;s possible application for entry,he was grateful for Dr. Kiesinger&apos;s excellent words in response to the appeal for support which he (Mr. Wilson) had made in his speech at dinner on the previous evening. He accepted the importance of avoiding prejudice to the supportDr. Kiesinger could give us by not making that support a public issue, and the relevant sentence of his own speech at dinner had not been in the text issued tothe Press. At his Press conference shortly, he would say that Dr. Kiesinger had spoken warmly in support of British entry and, if the Press asked him whatPresent:The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, m.p the Right Hon.

action Dr. Kiesinger would take with General de Gaulle, he would reply that anyexchanges between the Heads of other Governments were a confidential matter for the two Governments concerned.Their discussion on the Kennedy Round in the restricted session would be written into the record of their conversations and he would not, at this stage,repeat what they had said in that session.For a number of reasons Dr. Kiesinger and he had felt that it would bedesirable for the Anglo-German Economic Mission to meet soon at different levels;this might be a means of continuing the momentum of the approach to theCommunity once the series of visits by Mr. Brown and himself to the capitals ofthe Six Governments had been completed.On German offset costs there had been a brief discussion which was to becontinued through the other channels available to the two Governments.Ministers of both Governments had appreciated each othefs difficulties and if,in the last resort, certain actions had to be taken, they should be taken swiftlyin a detached and scientific way like a surgical operation, and not like an attackwith bludgeons. If such action had to be taken over offset costs, it wouldprovide certain persons, both in Germany and in Britain and in other countriestoo with the opportunity of sowing discord, and he would do his utmost to stopirresponsible comment.He understood that a grave matter of protocol was involved in deciding whether he had been in Bonn on a distinct bilateral visit or whether his presentvisit was regarded as part of the series of bilateral talks between the Heads ofGerman and British Governments. If the experts on protocol decided that hehad paid a distinct bilateral visit, he hoped that Dr. Kiesinger would, in turn, visitLondon. He recognised the commitments which Dr. Kiesinger had, and the timing of the visit would be a matter for Dr. Kiesinger to decide. Alternativelyif the experts decided that he (Mr. Wilson) had not paid a distinct bilateral visit,he hoped that he might be allowed to come to Bonn to do so some time in thefuture. Herr Brandt would be visiting London in April and would be meetingMr. Brown on various other occasions on which they could continue the dialoguebetween the two Governments.Finally, in furtherance of their discussion of the question of sterling he would arrange to convey to Dr. Kiesinger two notes, about the sterling balances and the overall position of sterling.ConclusionDr. Kiesinger said that Mr. Wilson had correctly summed up their discussions in restricted session. As regards protocol he considered that Mr Wilson had visited Bonn and visited it most impressively; but in saying this he would behappy to see Mr. Wilson in Bonn again as soon as possible. The talks had been extremely useful to the German Government, and had confirmed their conviction that they should support British entry into the Community. He hoped that thefurther talks Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown would have would be crowned with success, and he looked forward to hearing further from Mr. Wilson, and tovisiting London in due course.Mr. Wilson said that he too looked forward to their next meeting, and againexpressed thanks for the German Governmenfs warm hospitality.The meeting ended at 10.45 a.m.
RECORDS OF CONVERSATIONS IN THE HAGUERECORD OF CONVERSATION AT THE BRITISH EMBASSY, THE HAGUE.ON SUNDAY, 26th FEBRUARY, 1967, AFTER DINNERPresent:The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, m.p the Right Hon. George Brown, mpH E Sir Peter GarranSir Burke trend sir Con 0&apos;neill mr. W. A. NieldProfessor Dr. J. ZijlstraDr. J. M. A. H. LunsMr. L. de BlockDr. J. H. van RoijenMr. Wilson, after a general introduction, turned to the choices which wouldconfront the United Kingdom after the tour of the Six was over. There would be three possibilities open: to do nothing, which meant deciding that the conditionsof joining the Community did not exist; to apply for negotiations; or to do something in between. He emphasised the importance he attached to maintaining the momentum which the tour of the Community capitals had engendered.Mr. Brown suggested that before the Dutch commented on these possibilitiesit would be useful to hear their view of an argument that seemed to be gatheringstrength on the Community side, namely, that the entry of Britain and some members of EFTA would fundamentally change the Community&apos;s nature.Dr. Luns said that, although there was some truth in this, as far as the Dutchwere concerned they were perfectly happy to see the Community expanded to amembership of 10 or 11 and Professor Zijlstra added that there was probably anoptimum number of members, but he seemed prepared to go up as far as Dr. Luns.Mr. Brown remarked that the present members of the Community need notfear that an expanded Community would exhibit rigid patterns of alliance orvoting. There would be shifting patterns of interest according to varying interests on varying topics; and he thought this would give new flexibility and life to theexpanded Community. Dr. Luns accepted this concept; and went on to say thathe assumed that Mr. Wilson&apos;s first alternative choice of doing nothing was purelytheoretical and could be discarded; to which Mr. Wilson agreed.The remainder of the discussion can be summarised under the following headings.The next steps after the probeThe Dutch Ministers strongly urged the British Ministers to submit anapplication for membership of the Community as soon as possible, in order tomaintain the momentum of their approach. They strongly emphasised the needfor the simplest possible application and for the United Kingdom to be content with seeking solutions to all its problems by means of transitional periods only.They gave the impression they felt any other course would give the Frenchopportunity for infinite delay. The only exception to transitional periods as thesolution to all problems appeared when Professor Zijlstra admitted that there mightbe justification for &quot; a footnote on New Zealand butter &quot;.AgricultureThere was a good deal of discussion on agricultural finance. ProfessorZijlstra insisted that the burdens the British foresaw on their balance of payments as a result of the agricultural policy of the Community were likely to be muchalleviated through a probable rise in world prices. From the British side it was argued that the possibility that world prices might fall, after the end of the Vietnamwar, was not to be excluded: Dr. Zijlstra accepted this was possible.
The Dutch argued the case for the British giving up any hope of changing the Community&apos;s Agricultural Policy including the Financial Regulations duringnegotiations to enter the Community, and urged that instead they should rely onmodifying them in their favour through entering the Community in time to take part in their re-negotiation in 1969. The Dutch expressed their confidence thatthis could be achieved, but argued all the same that the new 1969 agriculturalfinance settlement would be bound to preserve the main lines of the existing system.In the course of argument on agriculture Dr. Luns mentioned a transitional period of five years as an indication of what he had in mind. He also said he regarded it as quite unrealistic to suppose that agricultural prices in the community would fall.The French attitudeDr. Luns said he was convinced that General de Gaulle had not yet finallymade up his mind as to what course he would pursue. Dr. Luns believed thatM. Couve de Murville would loyally implement whatever policy General de Gaullesought to follow.Mr. Wilson gave some account of his discussions with General de Gaulle inParis, the purport of which was to reinforce Dr. Luns&apos; view that the General hadby no means yet made up his mind, and to emphasise to the Dutch Ministers theextent to which his attitude seemed to have changed since 1963.Dr. Luns remarked that he personally was convinced that the French veto hadbeen cast in January 1963 only because the negotiations had then been on thebrink of success.Main British problemsMr. Wilson defined the main British problems as existing in the field ofagriculture (especially the Financial Regulation and New Zealand); capital movements (and especially the problem of portfolio investment), and commonwealth trade (New Zealand again and Commonwealth Sugar Agreement).He added that our regional policy, which had at one time looked as though it mightbe a serious problem, now seemed less difficult.Dealing with capital movements, Mr. Wilson said that Britain might beprepared to take her chance (subject to a transitional period) on direct investment.He explained the special difficulties of portfolio investment.Professor Zijlstra replied that here too Britain must be prepared to take theplunge and accept Community arrangements. The Dutch had had the sameproblem, and had found it soluble. He remarked that the Netherlands had largerinvestments in the United States than the United States had in the Netherlands.The CommissionThroughout the discussion the Dutch Ministers laid much emphasis on theimportance and usefulness of the role of the Commission. Mr. Wilson told themhow helpful the contacts he and Mr. Brown had had with the Commission in brussels had been, and he remarked that Dr. Mansholt had been specially helpful.Non-proliferationA reference by Dr. Luns to the need for Britain to tailor its general policies tothe aim of entering the Community led him to speak at some length on theNon-proliferation Agreement. He hoped that Britain would be prepared to accept some delay in which to join with European States in the search for a solution whichwould not cause difficulties in Europe. Dr. Luns emphasised that the threateneddifficulties were real. It was even possible that member States of the community would be unable to sign a Non-proliferation Treaty without breaching theEURATOM Treaty. If this seemed to be so they might have to refer the point to the European Court at Luxembourg before they could make up their minds;and the Court might well find the obligations of the two Agreements incompatible.Mr. Wilson acknowledged the reality of these difficulties, but reminded theDutch Ministers that what the Non-proliferation Agreement really aimed at
averting was not dangers in Europe, but dangers in, e.g., India and Pakistan orIsrael and Egypt. He went on to remark that it was unfortunate that EURATOMwas in a somewhat moribund condition, and he hoped that British entry into theCommunity could contribute to reviving it.Dutch actionMr. Brown made several attempts during the evening to persuade the DutchMinisters to indicate what help they would be able to give Britain should she apply for membership in the Community; but their response was confined to repeatingthat we must make the simplest possible application with the very minimum of conditions and rely exclusively on transitional periods to solve our problems, onthe grounds that there would then be, in their view, no basis on which to veto ordelay our entry.Throughout the evening the question of the sterling area and the sterling balances was never mentioned, nor was the condition of the United kingdom economy.RECORD OF MEETING BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND THESECRETARY OF STATE AND THE NETHERLANDS PRIMEMINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER AT THE ROLZAAL, THEHAGUE, ON 27th FEBRUARY, 1967, AT 10 a.m.The Right Hon.

Posthumus MeyjesDr. Zijlstra repeated his welcome of the previous evening. He hoped that thediscussions upon British entry into the Community would be fruitful. He asked mr. Wilson to introduce the discussion.Background to the United Kingdom initiativeMr. Wilson thanked Dr. Zijlstra for his welcome, and for the frank talkwhich had taken place on the previous evening. They would be aware of thepurpose of the present visit from the statement which he had made in the Houseof Commons on 10th November of which a copy had been given to the netherlands government at the time. The Netherlands Government would also have receivedfull reports on the previous four visits which he and Mr. Brown had paid to community capitals.
He and Mr. Brown were in The Hague to discuss how British and Commonwealthessential interests could be safeguarded if Britain were to accept the Treaty 0fRome and join the European Economic Community. In the light of their discussions with Community Governments, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would consider whether and when to activate the arrangements for negotiation for community membership. Behind all this there was a firm intention on the part ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government to join the Community if British essential interestscould be protected and to do so unreservedly, in the sense that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be prepared to play their full part in the development of theCommunity.Mr. Wilson said he had not embarked upon his round of visits to Communitycapitals in the expectation of getting or taking &quot; no &quot; for an answer. community countries had expressed their wish for British membership, and Article 237 of theTreaty of Rome said specifically that the Community was open to the accession ofadditional members.In return members of the Community were entitled to ask Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment how far they accepted the Treaty of Rome, which was the foundationstone of the Community. Mr. Wilson here quoted the words of his answer toMr. Grimond in the House of Commons on 10th November. He added that hehad enlarged in Strasbourg on the theme of our preparedness to accept the basicrules of the Community.As his talks with the Community countries had proceeded it had become clearthat the main difficulties were those arising out of the Common Agricultural Policy,the Community&apos;s policies on capital movements, and questions of commonwealth trade. During some of his earlier talks in the present series of visits to Communitycapitals, he had also discussed questions of regional policy but he was now less concerned with such issues.This did not mean to say that no other questions would arise in negotiation.There would be for example some agricultural questions not arising directly outof the Common Agricultural Policy, and there would need to be discussion of the timetable by which the common external tariff would be applied and the internaltariffs within the expanded Community abolished. But these were not questions of major difficulty. In addition there were certain subjects where we ourselves saw no difficulty but which members of the Community might regard as problems.To conclude, he did not think that we were proposing or asking for anything which it would be impossible to negotiate. We were not seeking to weaken theCommunity&apos;s sense of purpose or its institutions. If it were possible to overcome the difficulties, as he was sure that it would be, given goodwill on both sides,major new opportunities would open up. The Community would have an enormous potential represented by a population approaching 300 million; thisconstituted the biggest market in the world, with the exception of India and china which were not relevant to the present context. There would be a greatimpetus towards economic and technical development and thus towards thepolitical development of Europe. Europe would be enabled to play a bigger role in the world than at any recent time.Netherlands attitudeDr. Luns said that the Netherlands Government was not only sympatheticbut most favourably inclined towards British entry, for many reasons, botheconomic and political. Since the last war the Netherlands Government had beenabsolutely committed to the idea of greater cohesion and unity within europe and finally to the concept of a united Europe. Great Britain could and should play a very great role. This was not only because of the values which GreatBritain could contribute to the expanded Community; the Netherlands Governmentsaw in our accession the possibility of further harmonised development and close co-operation with North America. They had not forgotten President Kennedy&apos;sidea of an Atlantic partnership. They would feel a great loss if the Europeancontinent, without the United Kingdom, should develop in a way which wouldseparate her from her destiny. Netherlands exports to the outside world were very considerable, so that the Netherlands Government also had a strong economic interest in maintaining outside connections. It was true that, at the time of the signature of Rome 70 per cent of Netherlands exports were sent to third countries
outside the Community, and that now the proportion was little over half. Butthe Netherlands still had wide external interests.The Netherlands had been greatly disappointed when, for political reasons,the way to British membership had been blocked in 1963. Since then a crisishad been overcome within the Commuirty, but the scars were still present.Co-operation within the Common Market had lost some of its idealism and impetus.The Netherlands Government were confident that British membership wouldareatly contribute to inspiring the Community with new life.They recognised that some very important adjustments needed to be madeto allow the United Kingdom and the Community to adapt themselves to the new situation created by British membership. The Community had undergoneconsiderable development in 10 years; the pattern of development of the UnitedKingdom had not been the same as in the Common Market. But they felt thatthe main problems, in particular the agricultural problems, could be solved byformulae which would be reasonably acceptable to all.Mr. Wilson suggested the meeting might now turn to discussion of specificquestions raised by the entry of the United Kingdom to the e.c., and invitedMr. Brown to outline the major problems arising on agriculture.Common Agricultural PolicyMr. Brown said he was sorry that he would have to return to London beforevery long to deal with questions in Parliament. Mr. Mulley, the Minister of state in the Foreign Office, would replace him and speak on his behalf.Mr. Brown said that our attitude to the Common Agricultural Policy wascomparable to our attitude to the Treaty of Rome neither need raise questionsof principle. The policy did not constitute an impediment to British membershipprovided that the difficulties which would arise for us could be satisfactorilyhandled. These were of differing degrees of importance and differing solutionsmight be required.The first problem was the effect on the cost of living in the United Kingdom,and consequently on the prices and incomes stabilisation policy, which was important both to the United Kingdom and other countries. We estimated and experts in other Community capitals and the Commission seemed to agree broadlyon the figures that the retail cost of food would increase by between 10 and 14per cent, if there were no changes in world and Community prices by the time we joined the Community. It was of course impossible to be sure what the realposition would be. A rise in food prices of the size he had mentioned meantan increase on the cost of living of around 3 to 34- per cent. This would be aserious matter if all the increases took place at one time, but not if they werespread over a longer period. The severity of the problem depended on the lengthof the transitional period.The second problem was the effect on our own farmers and on the pattern of agricultural production in the United Kingdom. Cereal producers would gainadditional income. Livestock producers, principally in the western part of thecountry where climatic conditions were more difficult, would see their incomereduced. They would attempt to switch to cereals production, for which theirclimate and terrain were less favourable. It would therefore be necessary to take appropriate measures to deal with consequential problems of structuralreorganisation.  For this time would be needed, and financial assistance.Mr. Brown said that he understood that, in other capitals, it had been suggestedthat in asking whether some part of the very large sum the United Kingdom wouldbe paying in levies could not be used to finance this structural reorganisation, hewas insisting upon the retention by the United Kingdom of some part of the levyincome which would accrue. For the purpose of his question it was immaterialwhether the United Kingdom retained the funds or recovered them; he was notsuggesting that the money should not pass through the Community&apos;s AgriculturalFund.The third area of difficulty was the effect on Commonwealth trade. Sugarproducers in the Commonwealth enjoyed the benefit of the Commonwealth sugar agreement; and means would have to be found of overcoming their problems.
There would be some effect on Canada and Australia and the problems this raisedwere not without difficulty; but they were not of an order that could not. withgoodwill, be resolved. There would be very serious effects indeed on the NewZealand economy, and it was difficult to see how transitional periods couldovercome this problem, unless they were of such length that they would in effectbe equivalent to a material change in the existing arrangements. Various wayshad been suggested of overcoming this difficulty, among them, special guarantees of access to traditional markets, and association with the Community. Theproblem could certainly be solved, but it was a formidable one.The fourth question was the most difficult, namely the effect on the Britishbalance of payments if Community prices and financing arrangements remained unchanged. We calculated that the net adverse effect would be between 175 million and  250 million a year. The higher figure was likely to be the more realistic. This would not only represent an enormous burden on the British balanceof payments but would, in his view, be altogether inequitable. We were sure to beby far the largest importer in the expanded Community, and we calculated that weshould pay in levies virtually the same as the whole of the rest of the Communityput together. Taking contributions and levies together we might be payingsomething over 35 per cent of the Community budget. It seemed reasonabletherefore to ask that new arrangements should be made in order to reduce theburden on the United Kingdom to a tolerable level. His view was that, on the entry of a new member such as ourselves, there would need to be a review of thefinancial requirements of the Fund, and of the way in which the burden should be shared.He had described the problems in what he believed to be an ascending orderof difficulty. The answer lay partly in transitional periods, partly in adjustments of Community arrangements. We were convinced that none of these questionsneed raise insuperable difficulties or that their solutions need destroy the characterof the Community or of Community policies. He added that he had sometimesbeen reminded that there would be some savings to the Exchequer. He did notthink that he needed to remind an economist like Professor Zijlstra that in the one case internal finance was involved, in the other transfers across the exchanges.Professor Zijlstra thanked Mr. Brown for his exposition. As he understood the problem there would be two main elements affecting our balance of payments:(a) payments to the Agricultural Fund, which could be sub-divided as between theneed to transfer levies and the internal contribution to the Fund; and (b) theincrease in food prices which would arise in so far as imports were shifted from third country sources to Community sources.Mr. Brown said that the figures he had given made allowances for increases in United Kingdom production and shifts in import patterns. Figures quoted byDr. Mansholt in Brussels suggested that we would be making even higher levypayments than we calculated, but he thought that Dr. Mansholt might be basinghis calculations on the existing&apos; pattern of trade rather than allowing for shifts in import patterns. Mr. Brown said that we had made as good an allowance as wecould for shifts in import patterns and in production. We estimated that cerealsproduction might increase from 13 million to 20 million tons per year;Dr. Mansholfs figures for our levy contribution had in fact been something like 80 million above our own.Dr. Luns acknowledged the four problems mentioned by Mr. Brown, andthat a just solution to them must be found. The Netherlands Government thoughtthat most of them could be overcome by adequate transitional periods. He agreedthat the effect on the cost of living would be serious if the changes had to be madeall at once. But price adjustments took place every year under the common market regulations, and a transitional period would make the problem easier todeal with. The increase in the cost of living would be around 3 per cent. From1962-66 retail food prices in the United Kingdom had risen by 15-1 per cent. he did not therefore think that a 3 per cent rise, suitably spread, should occasion any great difficulty.Dr. Luns said that Professor Zijlstra and he had been struck by Mr. Brown&apos;smention of a possibility that levies might be retained by the United Kingdom todeal with problems of structural reorganisation. He thought this was dangerouspolitically, in that such a device might be used by some to justify an assertion that
Ihe United Kingdom was not ready to accept the Community system. TheCommunity&apos;s Regulation 25 required that from 1st January, 1970, all levies mustbe transferred to the Community for Community purposes. He would suggesttherefore that we should not advocate retention of the levies for British purposes.New Zealand was, in his view, by far the most important question. TheNetherlands Government thought there were several possibilities for dealing with it. He thought that in Bonn three different ideas had been put to us*: (a) aMorocco-type protocol the new arrangements for dealing with Morocco had notyet been worked out within the Community; (b) association with the Community;(c) some form of quota system. He believed that the length of a transitional periodmight be crucial in this case. The Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture believedthat the French were reluctant to accept quotas without any limitation on theirduration. But, for his part, he believed that the Netherlands could accept any ofthe three solutions that he had mentioned.As regards the balance of payments aspect of the agricultural question, hewould not be surprised if not only the United Kingdom, but France also, would wish to have this problem settled in advance of British entry. In May 1966 theFive had agreed that the principle of equitable sharing of burdens within theCommunity should apply. He thought that we had a fair point in arguing that theeffect upon our balance of payments would be inequitable. But he remindedMr. Brown that at the end of 1969 the present agricultural financing system withinthe Community would come to an end; if we were members by that time then weshould be able to play a major role in determining the future arrangements. Hethought that there should be a gradual transition from the present lower Britishprices to the higher prices applicable within the Community.Summing up, he said he shared our view that the problems were difficult butnot insurmountable.Mr. Wilson enquired exactly how much of the Community&apos;s present agriculturalarrangement had to be renegotiated in 1969. He understood that from 1970onwards all levies had to be paid into Community funds. What then could be changed? Dr. Luns said that, supposing the Community had been expanded to10 members by 1970, their calculation was that payments under the fund would amount to around  700 million plus  100 million for the guidance element.Netherlands experts calculated that the United Kingdom would get back something like  35 million out of the  175- 200 million which she might be expected to pay.But the whole of the agricultural financing arrangement was open to revision before1970, apart from the principle that all levies would be payable to Community funds.Mr. Franke added that of course price levels applicable in 1970 could not before seen at the moment. Changes in prices depended partly upon what wouldhave happened in the Kennedy Round. But he felt bound to say that he thought the chance of price increases was greater than the possibility of their decreasing.Professor Zijlstra asked whether we foresaw the changes which we needed beingmade before or after our entry to the Community. Would if be sufficient, in any agreement made, to state it as our reasonable expectation that such changes wouldbe made?Mr. Wilson asked for clarification of Dr. Luns&apos; view that the French might also be interested in changes. Dr. Luns said that the point arose on the balanceof payments effect. He merely thought that it was possible that the French might wish to raise this question in order to provide them with an opportunity of discussing many other questions as well. He had only brought the point up as anafter-thought. He agreed with Mr. Wilson that French motives in raising thequestion were likely to be very different from our own. He added that he doubted whether there could be any question of restricting in advance the liberty of individual countries to adopt particular positions in the 1969 renegotiation. but all Community countries thought that the burden upon the United kingdom balance of payments would range between &quot; somewhat excessive &quot; and &quot; veryexcessive &quot;. He had yet to hear anyone argue that this burden was a naturalconsequence of the British position.Professor Zijlstra explained the philosophy behind the requirement that leviesshould be paid over to the Community.*Note: Dr. Luns apparently thought that the Germans had proposed these ideas: in. factthey were tentatively mentioned in Bonn by Mr. Brown as possibilities.
Mr. Wilson said he was interested in the calculation that we might get back 35 million annually from the Community. At present we spent considerable sumsto assist British farmers. He thought there was some doubt about how far our existing production grants would qualify for Community assistance; one of the objectives of the Common Market was, he understood, to reduce production inhigh-cost areas. He was given to understand that some of our production grantsmight not be permitted to continue.Dr. Luns thought that changes in United Kingdom production might be tothe advantage of the United Kingdom. He would expect that production ofboth cereals and vegetables would increase. Mr. Wilson agreed that there wouldcertainly be a change in the pattern of production. But he thought that this wouldresult in an incorrect use of British resources. We were far better equipped for livestock than cereal production. We might finish up by being a major exporterof cereals. This he thought would be an irrational agricultural policy for theUnited Kingdom. Professor Zijlstra agreed that the Community&apos;s agricultural policy was not the most satisfactory one when seen in terms of the rationaldistribution of world resources; but the system was there and he feared that itsprinciples could not be substantially changed.Dr. Luns hoped that the four problems outlined by Mr. Brown could be solved,given goodwill, mostly by transitional periods.ProceduresProfessor Zijlstra asked if it would now be the wish of the British ministers to turn to questions of procedure; after signifying that this was so, Mr. Brown saidthat the guidance of the Netherlands Government would be welcome on the bestprocedure for the United Kingdom Government to follow after the present round of visits was completed.Dr. Luns said that there were three possibilities which could be considered.The first was to abandon the idea of applying for entry: he assumed this couldbe dismissed. The second was not to press too strongly for entry at present, but to wait for a more auspicious time later in 1967. The third was not to lose the presentimpetus but to follow up firmly the visits to the Six capitals. He favoured thethird, which might be essayed in various ways. The first might be to make adeclaration of intent, to which would be annexed the reasons why Britain wanted toenter the Common Market. The second might be to apply for membership andto specify the length of the transitional periods which would be required, in Britain&apos;view, to meet specific difficulties which she envisaged. The third would be to apply for membership and refer to the need for transitional periods, but then to indicateBritain&apos;s willingness to enter into negotiations within a given period, should theCommunity wish this. This third possibility would enable Britain to avoid thecharge that she did not really accept the Treaty of Rome and the regulations madeunder it. Britain should be ready to undertake preliminary talks with theCommunity if that were desired. The various positive approaches had advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand if Britain applied for entry immediately the visits were concluded she might risk being rebuffed. On the other hand delay insubmitting an application would enable the Community to discuss other matters and thus lose the momentum which had been gathering since November 1966. Tobe too specific about the length of transitional periods might give the impression that Britain had too many caveats about the Treaty of Rome; not to specify the transitional periods might incur the charge of vagueness or unreadiness to negotiate.Mr. Wilson said that Dr. Luns had summed up the dilemma confrontingBritain. On the one hand Her Majesty&apos;s Government wanted to avoid a loss ofmomentum and the prospect of long and arid talks about entry before realnegotiations began. On the other hand they wanted to avoid a rebuff which mightwell be taken in Britain as a final rejection and would have serious effects on thepolitical unity of Europe. Such a rebuff would call for the examination of alternative schemes to bridge the gap between the various groupings in the western world. The fact that the visits to the capitals of the Six had been carried outquickly with little interval between each had maintained the momentum. Oneproposal which had been made was that a further round of bilateral talks mightbe undertaken in which he and Mr. Brown might or might not participate but we ought to get into a position where exploration could merge into negotiation, perhaps
on a multilateral basis, although there were certain aspects which could profitablybe discussed at varying levels on a bilateral basis. Visits would not solve theproblem of France&apos;s policy, which remained enigmatic. At an appropriate momentfurther talks would be needed, but if they were to be with the Community assuch, rather than with its individual members, the talks should be with the Councilof Ministers of the Community.Dr. Luns said that discussions with the Community should be preceded bya definite application by Britain to join in some form or other. This would counter the French argument that the Council could make no move, because Britain had made no definite application.Mr. Wilson reminded him that Britain had made an application in January1963 and said that he had asked the Commission whether they regarded it as amatter which had been adjourned. If Her Majesty&apos;s Government asked for the adjournment to be lifted was it conceivable that France at that stage could decline to have it lifted, or would the French ask for Britain, e.g., to declare her attitudetowards the Treaty of Rome before the request could be considered?Dr. Luns said that he thought that, despite some difficulty and the allegationthat the British Government had been ruminating for too long, the adjournmentcould be lifted and that the French would not try to block such a course.Mr. Brown said that once there was a multilateral meeting between Britainand the members of the Community its only purpose could be to begin negotiations.The real difficulty was when to start negotiations. Mr. Wilson and he had not finally decided what to recommend to their Cabinet colleagues. In their discussions in the capitals of the Six they had indicated the likely problems confrontingBritain and the kind of solutions which might be found, but they had had no indication from the French of the kind of solutions which would commendthemselves. If negotiations could not begin that would be tantamount to a breakdown.Dr. Luns advised that Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Communities should ask the Commission to lift the adjournment. He was glad that during their visit to Brussels Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown had held a discussion with the Commissionsince this was bound to create goodwill towards Britain. Although the commission had no say in procedural questions it had the power to offer legal advice.Mr. Wilson said that although the talks in Brussels might have createdgoodwill in the Commission it did not necessarily follow that it had createdgoodwill in France. When he had asked the Commission informally at lunchabout Britain&apos;s earlier application the members of the Commission had said thatthey understood that the British application of 1963 stood adjourned. But theyhad not been giving a considered view and some members had suggested thatpsychologically it would be preferable for Britain to submit a fresh application.Dr. Zijlstra said that a fresh application might be simpler to deal with.Dr. Luns said that if the adjourned application were revived there was a danger that all the old files would be brought out with the attendant risk of arousing oldanimosities and renewing detailed and profitless discussions which was notgermane to the new situation. He suggested that it might be prudent to ask theFrench Government and the other member Governments what their views were on procedure.Mr. Wilson said that the French Government were likely to say that, whetherHer Majesty&apos;s Government resuscitated the earlier application or put in a new one,the only point of interest was whether Britain accepted the Treaty of Rome.Dr. Zijlstra said that Her Majesty&apos;s Governments position seemed now fairlyclose to accepting the Treaty of Rome, which contained arrangements fortransitional periods. To resuscitate the earlier application would complicatematters seriously; a new application should be made accepting the Treaty of rome and its consequences. If Britain raised all the important problems which had been mentioned by Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown such as changing the system of payments to the Agricultural Fund, and asked for these problems to be discussed beforeentry in the Common Market that would create a new stumbling block. But ifthe United Kingdom accepted the Treaty of Rome subject only to transitionalperiods, she could expect solutions to be found after she had entered.   It was
certainly possible for Britain to express her expectation that a reasonable solution would be found to the various problems but to make pre-conditions as distinct from transitional periods would create new stumbling blocks. The applicationfor entry should therefore be couched in as simple terms as possible.Mr. Wilson asked whether Dr. Zijlstra would agree with Britain saying thatshe would seek to join the Community, provided that means could be found of safeguarding essential British and Commonwealth interests.Dr. Luns said that Britain would then be asked what those essential interests were.Mr. Wilson said that we could answer that question. The onus of sayingthat there should be no negotiations on the basis of that formula would fall noton Britain but on the Community or a member of the Community. If her majesty&apos;s Government were asked what the essential problems were she would reply on the lines indicated in the discussions in the capitals of the Six. But whatwould happen once Britain had given these answers? What would the Councilof Ministers and the Commission do then?Dr. Luns said that he was not too optimistic about the next step. What theCouncil of Ministers did would be affected by political bias. The simplerBritain&apos;s application was, the better. If it mentioned safeguarding commonwealth interests it would provide those who did not want Britain in the Community witha pretext for saying that Britain did not accept the Treaty of Rome in its entirety.It would be better to concentrate on transitional arrangements and make anapplication with as few conditions as possible.Mr. Wilson said that if the advice meant that Britain should put in an entirelyunconditional application it would not be accepted by the British Parliament unless it was backed by a clear understanding of what would happen in relation to Britishand Commonwealth interests, what would be covered in the negotiations and whatwould be left for later settlement, and so on.Mr. Brown said that Britain was in the difficult position of answering all thequestions put by the French but receiving no answer from the French to thequestions Britain herself put. Would it be possible for the netherlands government to apply any pressure in Paris?Dr. Luns said that the Netherlands Government would exert what influencethey could among the Five in order to provide Britain with the best possibleplatform but the main problem was to avoid receiving a downright refusal andto avoid unnecessary procrastination.Dr. Zijlstra said that if Britain&apos;s application did not specify exactly whatHer Majesty&apos;s Government wanted, and did not deal with timing, it would giveFrance and the Five a chance to object.Mr. Wilson said that if however our application was exact, that would surelyinvite either a rejection or procrastination?Dr. Luns agreed but said that a firm application would at least get thingsmoving.Mr. Brown said that Mr. Wilson and he had now received almost as muchadvice as they could hope to get in their visits. They knew the various courses open to the British Government and would be able to decide what to recommend to their Cabinet colleagues. He agreed that it would only be a matter of weeks before a decision had to be taken on the next steps, in order to avoid a loss ofmomentum or a charge of procrastination. When Dr. Luns said he assumed thatno definite decision would be taken until after the French elections on 15th March,Mr. Brown agreed and reminded Dr. Luns of the forthcoming visits toLuxembourg and to the EFTA meeting in Stockholm.Kennedy RoundMr. Wilson said that his colleagues would want to know what progress wasbeing made in the Kennedy Round to harmonise the different offers made byBritain and by the Community.
pDr. Luns said that it was important politically for Britain not to give theimpression that she did not take the views of the Six into account in the kennedy round negotiations.Non-proliferationDr. Luns said the same applied to the Non-proliferation Treaty which wasalso a delicate matter, and could create prejudice as a result of the attitude of theEURATOM Commission to the proposed controls under the Non-proliferationTreaty as now put forward. The unsatisfactory development of EURATOMstemmed partly from the French attitude in 1963. But he must stress that theNetherlands Government did not want EURATOM to be further weakened. TheEURATOM Commission^ objections were levelled only at the system of controlsof the Non-proliferation Treaty but they were very powerful as they regardedsignature of the Treaty with its control clause as incompatible with the Treatyof Rome. The Netherlands Governments legal experts were less pessimistic thanthose of EURATOM, but their views had to be taken into account, and he hopedthat it would not be necessary to refer the matter to the Court in Luxembourgwhich could take a long time to reach a decision. The Federal GermanGovernment had expressed a fear which the Netherlands Government sharedto a lesser extent that the United States and the United Kingdom might get an unfair advantage over other countries as a result of their nuclear development in the peaceful uses of atomic energy and in the civil &quot; spin-off &quot; which flowedfrom it.Mr. Wilson suggested that it might be helpful if a Minister of State in theForeign Office perhaps Mr. Mulley and Lord Chalfont together with an experton control procedures were to visit EURATOM and the Commission for further discussions on this point. ITe believed that there was very little civil &quot; spin-off &quot;from military atomic energy, and our experts could be made available to discuss this too.Dr. Luns said that it was important to talk to EURATOM, which had itsown machinery. But if the &quot; Vienna &quot; non-proliferation controls were acceptedFrance would boycott EURATOM, and this would further reduce its effectiveness.The Netherlands Parliament was anxious to maintain EURATOM as an instrument of European co-operation.Mr. Brown said it would be intolerable if France kept Britain out of europe and at the same time nullified EURATOM. He hoped both that EURATOMwould survive and that the Non-proliferation Treaty would succeed.Kennedy RoundDr. Zijlstra said that the Netherlands Government were not over-optimisticabout the outcome of the Kennedy Round negotiations. He asked what the british governments forecast was.Mr. Wilson said that Britain was not over-optimistic ejther. The problem was not capable of solution if left to itself, since the American Congress wouldnot extend the Presidents powers under the Trading Negotiations Act when theyexpire this summer, unless the substantive Kennedy Round negotiations had been successfully completed, leaving only consequentials and details to be settled.Britain was disappointed with the Community&apos;s offer list which did notcompare favourably with Britain^. Our offer list was more generous andour exceptions list smaller. We would prefer to see the Community&apos;soffer improved in order to move to a higer level of agreement, rather than toreduce our own offer list. It was unrealistic to measure our offers by the tradingposition of countries in 1962, since in that year Britain had suffered a tradingdepression. In 1962-63 British imports and manufactured goods increased by30 per cent and in 1963-64 by a further 30 per cent. There had been little increasein 1964-65 because of the imposition of the temporary import surcharge. imports in 1965-66 had risen by at least a quarter and were rising again in 1966-67 asa result of the removal of the import surcharge. In other words British imports and manufactured goods in 1966-67 were almost double those imported in 1962-63and the value of our offers was thus much greater than the original figuressuggested.  He doubted whether this was as true of other countries.Dr. Zijlstra said that in the negotiations in Geneva the problem of agriculturepresented particular difficulties.   Closer co-operation between the delegation of
Britain and the Community might help to promote the momentum of Britain^soundings about entry into the Common Market and this could be psychologicallybeneficial.Mr. Wilson said that we should like to see the two delegations come closer together but one-way co-operation was of no avail, and we should appreciate someencouraging move on the part of the Community.United Kingdom balance of paymentsDr. Zijlstra asked whether it would not be better, in dealing with the common agricultural Policy or any other question, to lay less emphasis on the balanceof payments situation? This was undesirable, as being likely to give theimpression that the British balance of payments remained weak. PerhapsMr. Wilson could say something on this subject.Mr. Wilson acknowledged that it would be preferable, in dealing with thefourth and most difficult problem which Mr. Brown had described in relation tothe Common Agricultural Policy, to stress the essential unfairness of theCommunity&apos;s financial arrangements rather than to emphasise the strain whichunconditional acceptance of the policy would place on our balance of payments.The Labour Government had inherited a balance of payments deficit of some 800 million in 1964. The exact size of the deficit depended upon whether accountwas taken of payment of interest and amortisation of the 1946 American loan.Britain had the right to defer payment until the end of the period of the loan whichwas towards the end of the century. &quot;In 1964-65 we had deferred payment butnot in 1966. Allowing for repayments of the loan, the deficit in 1964 had beenaround  830 million, in 1965  370 million and in 1966 it was expected that the deficit would be around  200- 250 million. The exact figure would be availablewithin the next few weeks. In the fourth quarter of 1966 we had been in surplus,although it was true that there were favourable seasonal factors, e.g., less Britishtourist expenditure in that quarter than in the third quarter of the year. Theposition now was that we were moving strongly towards a surplus in the balanceof payments in 1967 and 1968. We had never been, almost within living memory,in direct surplus on trade alone as we had been reecntly, but our invisible earningshad traditionally cancelled out the visible trade deficit and met our government expenditure overseas. We were now trying to hold down or reduce our overseasGovernment expenditure, which amounted to some  300 million on defence andsome  200 million on overseas aid; the House of Commons would be debatingour defence expenditure that day and the next. As the Netherlands Governmentwould know, we were redeploying and reducing our forces overseas. This would continue, and much would depend upon the solution of the problem of Germanoffset costs where we carried a heavy burden in payments over the exchanges. Wewere not seeking a reduction in budgetary expenditure, but what had beenenvisaged in the original agreement, i.e., the avoidance of payments across theexchanges which prejudiced our balance of payments. We had set a target of 100 million reduction over the year in the Governments oversea expenditure.It was not easy to implement, as the reactions of the Maltese Government made plain. Malta wanted our forces to remain; Aden wanted our forces to remain;and it was likely that Singapore also would not want a reduction in our forces,which would affect the employment &apos;of 30,000 workers there. It could not be denied that the presence of British Forces in a developing country carried with itstrong implications of British aid, and the reduction of the Governmenfs overseas expenditure was thus not an easy task.(Mr. Brown expressed his regrets that he must now withdraw from the meeting to return to London. Accompanied by Dr. Luns, he left the meeting andMr. Mulley joined it at this point.)United Kingdom economic positionMr. Wilson, turning to the economic position of the United Kingdom, saidthat our general trading balance was now very good. The monthly trade deficit,exports and re-exports being set against imports, had been reduced from 45 million per month in 1964 to  23 million per month in 1965 and  12 million per month in 1966. It might be suggested that these figures had been achievedonly by imposing severe deflation, but it should be remembered that the measures
of July 1966 had hardly had time to make themselves felt in our export performanceby the end of 1966. Our internal economic position in 1966 had been one of fairlyhioh activity and relatively low unemployment. In the last quarter our tradefjaures had been phenomenally good; we had a  90 million surplus, due in part[o the postponement of imports until the removal of the temporary importsurcharge. Using the old method of calculating exports f.o.b. and imports c.i.f.there had not been a quarter in the last 50 or 60 years which had shown a tradingsurplus, until the last quarter of 1966. In January 1967 our exnorts had risenagain. In short, between 1964 and the beginning of 1967 we had had the biggestincrease in exports for a very long time. The value of our exports had increasedby some 14 per cent over the last two years in compound value (7 per cent over1964-65 and 6-5 per cent over 1965-66). We expected this trend to continue; ithad done so in the latter half of 1966 when the economy was still overheated; the trend was underlying and not related to the July measures. We had increased the emphasis laid upon exports, and The Queen had approved the introduction ofa new Honour for those who promoted the increase in our export performance.We had no tax-on-value-added system to assist our exports through rebates of tax,but we were examining its possibilities.The measures we had taken in July 1966 were calculated to hold back imports and to apply a salutary shock to our industrial system. British industry was now more cost-conscious and this applied both to the employers and to the trade unions.The need to avoid waste both in money and in labour was being reappraised. all this would help our export performance, and it was only in a few areas that therewas now a shortage of skilled labour. Given the continuance of our present exportperformance, we were confident about the basis of our future balance of payments and, indeed, we expected to be one of the few countries to be in surplus by theend of 1967.Dr. Zijlstra said that the Netherlands and Germany expected to be in surplusand had experienced the same sort of swing as Britain had between 1966-67.Mr. Wilson said that concern had been expressed elsewhere that Britain&apos;strade was in surplus only as a result of severe deflation. In the 1950s the tradecycle had been related more to the periodicity of elections than to true economic factors. The 1959 election had been won on the slogan &quot; You&apos;ve never had it sogood&quot;. But this consumer boom had led to the crisis in 1960 and to stagnationleading to high unemployment in 1963. It should be remembered that therestrictions of July 1966 had been imposed on top of the biggest budget surplussince the war and had been made inter alia by imposing restrictions on excessconsumer demand through the hire-purchase regulations. This had led, admittedly,to some unemployment in the motor car industry, but he would regard it as a failureof his Governments policies if Britain were to reflate by the old means ofindiscriminate expansion of uneconomic consumer and social expenditure. Insteadwe proposed to give priority to purposive investment expenditure. To help take up slack in the economy we had set up the Industrial Reconstruction Corporationwith  150 million capital to encourage industrial rationalisation; a further  150million was being spent on reconstruction of the docks to assist our exports;substantial funds were being devoted to the re-equipment of our shipbuilding industry, and we were building more factories in depressed parts of the countryto prevent other parts, such as the Midlands and the South-East from becomingover-developed. The Governments reflation policy was to switch frominvestment&quot; in consumer durables, to capital investment in industries whichwould promote our export performance and thus help our balance of payments.Moreover, we attached great importance to our policy of incomes restraint.As a result of the freeze which had been imposed by the Government, wage rateshad been raised by 0 -1 per cent of 1 per cent over the last six months. Some slighteasing of the position would follow: on his return from The Hague he would behaving difficult discussion with the trade unions. It was generally agreed that fora considerable period in the future restraint would be needed in prices and incomes,and the argument, though keen, related only to the method of achieving suchrestraint. Mr. Wilson said he had gone into some detail as Dr. Zijlstra, anothereconomist, had expressed interest in the way in which Britain was meeting her economic problems.
Dr. Zijlstra thanked Mr. Wilson for his detailed exposition: the Netherlands,as Mr Wilson knew, was facing similar problems of wage restraint. He should perhaps mention also that if Britain joined the Common Market the fiscal system would have to be adjusted to meet the requirements of the Community.Mr. Wilson said that British experts were already working on the modalitiesof assimilating our tax system to that of the Community, and also of assimilatingour social policies to those of the Six.The Meeting adjourned for lunch at 12.30 p.m.RECORD OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER ANDTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND THENETHERLANDS PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTERAT THE ROLZAAL, THE HAGUE, ON MONDAY, 27th FEBRUARY,1967, AT 4 p.m.Present:The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, mp      Professor Dr. J. ZijlstraThe Right Hon. Frederick Mulley, m p  Dr. J. M. A. H. LunsHE Sir Peter Garran Mr. L. de BlockSir Burke Trend HE Dr. J.

Posthumus MeyjesThe role of sterlingDr. Zijlstra said that, in the light of Mr. Wilson&apos;s economic exposition inthe morning, it might be helpful if he could now deal with the implications of sterling^ role as both a world currency and a reserve currency for the mutual aid provisions of Article 108 of the Treaty of Rome. Section 108 had been formulated in order to encourage members of the Community to give mutualhelp to any member country with balance of payments problems. When theTreaty of Rome was being drawn up, none of the currencies of the signatorieswas a reserve currency, and so the problems which would arise on Britain&apos;s entryhad not been foreseen. It might perhaps be possible to distinguish normalassistance to e.c. members with balance of payments problems from the problemsof sterling as a world currency?Mr. Wilson said that Article 108 had, of course, already been invoked onbehalf of Italy when she had had balance of payments problems. It almostseemed as if the Article had been drafted with Britain in mind, as it might beused not only if there were a disequilibrium in one&apos;s balance of payments; butalso when there was no disequilibrium on the domestic balance of payments, forexample, but only shortage of a particular type of currency or speculative pressure.Our view was, in fact, that the position of sterling depended very largely onBritain&apos;s own balance of payments. It was true there had been psychologicalfactors affecting sterling in 1965 and 1966 when the British balance of payments hadin fact been improving; but these factors really arose from the lack of confidencenot so much in sterling as in the basic British balance of payments situation. He
had that morning explained the great improvement which had taken place in our balance of payments, and why we thought it would continue. Once we werein surplus, we did not expect lack of confidence in sterling to recur; but therewere clearly two other factors, apart from the British balance of payments, which in previous discussions had been cited as affecting the position of sterling; one wasthe sterling balances; another was the role of sterling as an internationallyaccepted and convertible currency and, in reply to Professor Zijlstra, he would say something on each.Many countries were willing to hold their reserves in sterling because it was acceptable as an international currency and, unlike gold, it bore interest. the sterling balances had remained fairly constant in total even in 1966. There hadbeen fluctuations, and big changes in their distribution, but, taking one year with another, the level of our sterling balances had been steady. Under the BasleAgreement a fall in the level of sterling balances could be offset by financialassistance from the signatories to the Basle Agreement. That mechanism whichwas an extra-Community arrangement in which the Six countries took part had worked well recently.Between one-third and one-half of total world trade was conducted in sterling,and this second or trading currency role of sterling meant that leads and lagsoperated sharply. Over the last three years, this had happened three or four times, but those who had sold sterling short had lost money in doing so. So longas the paeity was right and we should see that it was kept right, the Communityneed have no fears about Article 108.We could appreciate that the Six might feel anxious that a recurrence of balance of payments difficulties combined with a reserve currency might if wehad again to take remedial measures, lead to the export of unemployment becauseour deflation might in turn affect other member countries. But the Six neednot fear that they would be affected by Britain&apos;s entry in this way. There werefour safeguards:(1) Our balance of payments prospects were good.(2) The level of sterling balances remained relatively constant.(3) Special arrangements such as the Basle Agreement and recourse to theIMF were available should sterling come under pressure.(4) Britain&apos;s assets at home and abroad exceeded, overall, our liabilities.Dr. Zijlstra said that every bank ought to be able to realise its assets in anemergency. Mr. Wilson replied that any bank would have a difficult passage inmobilising quickly all its assets. Some of ours could be mobilised quickly: others were not liquid. But no country had a vested interest in seeing the poundweakened and Her Majesty&apos;s Government for their part regarded it as their duty to keep it strong.Turning to the sterling balances, Mr. Wilson said these were composed ofdifferent elements. Balances of sterling kept by Central Banks and governments in the sterling area as a backing for internal currencies were a stable element.Trading corporations abroad such as the Ghana Cocoa Stabilisation Board heldsubstantial balances in Britain. When cocoa prices had fallen, their sterling balances had fallen, but when prices rose, sterling balances rose also. Severaloversea banks had appreciable holdings in Britain and many had holdings with local authorities: on occasion, they reduced their balances, but were not likelyto do so while interest rates in Britain remained relatively high. Large tradingorganisations such as Unilever and Royal Dutch Shell also held balances to financetheir transactions both in Britain and in other countries, for example, for the repayment of royalties; some corporations which had reduced their balances in1966 were now obliged to build them up again.While we now saw no likelihood of our entry involving our partners in theCommunity in the danger of deflation if difficulties with sterling did recur, weshould be prepared to discuss the possibility of special arrangements should there be at some time in the future a move towards a single European currency. In that event, a number of measures might be considered for dealing with the sterling balances, but the IMF would be the appropriate forum for considering them inthe first instance.
Dr. Zijlstra said that in order to avoid the necessity of the other members ofthe Community underwriting sterling should Britain join the Community, would it not be desirable to limit the application of Article 108 to normal fluctuations in the balance of payments, and not to extend it to cover risks arising frompressures on a reserve currency, should a country like Britain with such a currencyjoin the Community? The intention of the Six in drafting Article 108 had taken no account of the possibility of a member possessing a reserve currency.Dr. L uns asked whether Article 108 would in law be applicable to a reservecurrency; for example, legal experts had some doubts whether it could apply tofluctuations in the sterling balances.Mr. Wilson said that he would leave the legal arguments to the lawyers, buton the subsance of it, if the Six sought a derogation from the terms of the Treatyof Rome in respect of Article 108 if Britain became a member, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be happy to give it sympathetic consideration! Otherwisea layman might be inclined to interpret Article 108 as applying not only to anybalance of payments difficulties Britain might have, but also to strains arising fromsterling^ role as a reserve currency. It should, he thought, be possible to distinguish between these two kinds of fluctuation.The responsibility for helping Britain, if she were a member of e.c., in any difficulties arising from sterlings international role should remain where it was now, i.e., with the international monetary arrangements in which a much widergroup of countries and central banks than those of the Six participated. WhenItaly had balance of payments difficulties, Britain, as well as members of the eec and the United States and other members of the worlds financial communityrallied round; and similarly with Britain in 1964. Moreover, assistance to India,Ghana, Ceylon and other countries in financial difficulties was given by a wide range of countries in the international financial community acting as consortia.The Six should therefore not fear that if Britain became a member of theCommunity she would place a legalistic interpretation upon the mutual aidprovisions of Article 108 in order to meet pressures arising from sterlingsinternational role, e.g., to underwrite the sterling balances.Dr. Luns said that it would be good for other members of the Six to know of this answer. 1-jhr.. van Lennep said that Mr. Wilson had clarified the position. Article 108had been drafted at a time when currencies were not readily convertible and itwas doubtful whether it would apply to movements in the sterling balances. Ithad been drafted in circumstances when currencies were not convertible as theywere to-day, and had been intended to provide assistance of a limited nature, the concept being that a member countryS deficit would primarily be dealt with inthe context of the International Monetary Fund, and that assistance under Article108 would be a standby arising from any special strains or limitations which a country might experience as a result of its membership of a common market.Although Britain had among her assets extensive overseas investment there mightbe difficulties of liquidity in mobilising these investments in support of sterling.There was, therefore, some concern that, if Britain did not have a healthy balanceof payments, there would be a danger of her having to resort to restrictive ordeflationary measures which would affect her Common Market partners. Itwould be useful to have it on the record that the Community would not have to underwrite sterling against confidence movements if Britain had difficulties with her balance of payments; and that that responsibility would continue to beshouldered by the existing international monetary arrangements.Mr. Wilson said that it was realistic and reasonable to interpret, as jhr.. vanLennep had done, Article 108 not according to the strict letter of the law butaccording to the intention of its draftsmen. It was a reassuring factor that theTreaty of Rome was now being interpreted more pragmatically. The increasedconvertibility of currencies which had come about since the formulation of theTreaty of Rome had, of course, brought other developments in its train, and itcould be that the e.c. might encounter a Euro dollar squeeze if the United Statesbalance of payments were brought into surplus especially for example, if thewar in Vietnam were to end.
He agreed whole-heartedly with jhr.. van Lennep that the kind of problem which sterling had encountered over the last three years was a matter of concern to a much wider circle of financial authorities than those of the e.c., and was amatter concerning the financial authorities of the free world. In other words,under Article 108, the financial authorities of the e.c. would not have a specialCommunity obligation towards sterling, but rather a general concern sharedwith the other financial authorities of the world, i.e., as members as it were ofthe club of Central Bankers as the Federal Reserve Bank was. They had in facthelped Britain in 1964 in this latter capacity and not as members of the e.c..This was a new point, which had not been raised, at any rate in this form, in theprevious visits to the capitals of the Six.Dr. Zijlstra and Dr. Luns said that it was very important and useful toknow that, if Britain joined the e.c., Article 108 would not in her view obligethe other members to be sole underwriters of sterling. They had often told theother members of the Community this, but this was the first time their thesishad been confirmed.Dr. Zijlstra said that it was sometimes said that Britain&apos;s net reserve position was not a strong one, and therefore, despite what Mr. Wilson had just said, inthe event of Britain joining the Community, the other members would be at some risk. The United States had a deficit in their balance of payments, but theypossessed enormous assets throughout the world. Mr. Wilson had describedBritain&apos;s economic growth and recovery but, in relation to the members of the eec, her reserve position was, relatively speaking, weak. Had Britain&apos;s balanceof payments improved sufficiently to be shockproof?Mr. Wilson said that our reserves were healthy in relation to our presentand likely future balance of payments. We would be repaying later this yearsome of our drawings from the IMF. This repayment would have to be debitedagainst our surplus in 1967 and our reserves. Our reserves covered a widespectrum of assets ranging from gold and convertible currencies in the Bank ofEngland to other less readily available assets. Our liquid assets did not, however,consist merely of gold and convertible currencies. We had liquified a largeportion of our Government-held assets in the United States, but we had not yettaken them all into our reserves. In addition, we had short-term investmentsabroad, and also a very large portfolio investment which could in emergency bemobilised as the United States had done, although to realise these assets would affect the countries in which they were held as had happened in 1964 when someexternal investment in Britain had been realised. Our total oversea assets,including direct as well as portfolio investment, amounted to some tens of billionsof dollars, but they were not all of course Government assets, nor of course werethe oversea assets of the United States.Dr. Zijlstra said that it would not be possible for the Government to mobiliseprivate portfolio investment overseas quickly. *Mr. Wilson said that he could see no situation in which the BritishGovernment would have to take urgent steps to mobilise oversea assets on thescale of our holdings. It was true that it would not be easy to liquify them,and whilst we had been obliged to realise some private oversea investments duringthe war there was no question of our having to do that now.Capital movementsDr. Zijlstra asked whether the Community&apos;s regulations on capital movementspresented problems for Britain.Mr. Wilson said that on capital movements it was necessary to distinguishdirect and portfolio investment. If we accepted the rules in respect of direct investment, it was uncertain whether investment between Britain and the Sixwould result in a net gain or a net loss to our balance of payments. However, itwas probable that in an enlarged Community there would be more United Statesand other third country investment both in Britain and in the e.c.. In principle,therefore, Britain should be able to follow the same road as the Six in relation to direct investment, but it was possible that there might be a need for arrangements to cover a period of strain for a year Or two.
As regards portfolio investment, it was again difficult to say whetherliberalisation would on balance lead to increased portfolio investment from theCommunity to Britain, or vice versa. Our concern was that liberalisation could lead an outflow of capital from Britain through the Six to the United Statessince the members of the Community did not control outward portfolio investment closely as Britain did. Merchant bankers could, if our control onportfolio investment from Britain to the Community were lifted, organise in amatter of minutes investment from Britain to third countries, e.g., the UnitedStates, via Community financial centres who were not under similiar control ofoutward investment. It would be necessary to discuss such controls, without which we might find ourselves promoting property development in Manhattan atthe expense of building up technological development in Europe. Britain would for this reason have more reservations on freedom of portfolio investment thanon freedom of direct investment.There was also a regional problem arising from the control of direct investment. Unless Her Majesty&apos;s Government were allowed to continue theirpresent policy of restricting industrial development in the South-East of England,there would be over-development of that part of Britain if Britain joined theCommunity; and still more so when the Channel tunnel had been opened. Atpresent our controls enabled us to prevent building of factories in congestedareas: he understood, however, from previous discussions that this would stillbe permissible if we joined the Community: it was important for us to knowwhether severe restrictions on regional development could be maintained in theCommunity.Dr. Zijlstra said that the Netherlands Government operated regional policiesdesigned to promote investment in certain parts of the country, and as a corollaryto inhibit development in other parts. The Commission was considering how toharmonise the regulations dealing with regional development in the member countries of the Six, but they all had sensitive regional problems, and he did not envisage that regional policies would be a serious problem for Britain if shejoined the Community.Returning to the main subject, Dr. Zijlstra said he appreciated that freedomof capital movements presented Britain with a problem. The Netherlands had also had problems with capital movements in 1957 when the Treaty of Rome wasbeing formulated; and he advised Mr. Wilson not to make a pre-condition of entry of capital movements. All the members of the Common Market hadproblems in connection with capital flows, and if Britain joined, she could discuss with the other members of the Community the further control of capital movementsto third countries.jhr.. van Lennep said that when the Community rules were made, there hadbeen no problem of undue net outward flows of investment, and the rules did not therefore provide for Community control over them. He would appreciate that britain might accept a wider measure of liberalising capital movements withinthe e.c. than to third countries. But there was a ready made solution in Article 70,Section 2, of the Treaty of Rome, which provided that:&quot; Where the measures taken in accordance with the preceding paragraphdo not permit the elimination of differences between the exchange rules of member States, and where such differences lead persons resident in one ofthe member States to make use of the transfer facilities within the Community,as provided for under Article 67, in order to evade the rules of one of the member States in regard to third countries, that State may, after consulting the other member States and the Commission, take appropriate measures to overcome these difficulties.&quot;The Community preferred non-discriminatory policies, but if there had to bediscrimination against third countries, Article 70 would surely provide the solution?Mr. Wilson agreed that Article 70 might help. This could be discussed furtherif Britain were to join the Community. A longer period of adjustment wouldcertainly be required by Britain for portfolio investment than for direct investment,and he was not sure whether transitional arrangements would be adequate. he observed that the Community accepted discrimination in agricultural policy in theinterests of European agriculture to the disadvantage of other agricultural
countries. It hardly seemed consistent with this that discrimination in respect ofhortfolio investment which could promote the economic and technological development of Europe should be frowned upon especially as capital movementshad been liberalised more than trade since the last war.Dr. Zijlstra said that France would be Britain&apos;s best ally if she sought to restrict the freedom of portfolio investment to third countries. The balance ofpayments of the Community as a whole was strong, but there was some concern about the export of capital.jhr.. van Lennep said that the Community policies had been formulated at atime when there was too great an inflow of capital, and there: had been no need toimpose restrictions on outward flows; but if a net outflow from the community to third countries were to develop, this would soon lead to a reconsideration ofpolicy, and there was no Community philosophy against restriction of outwardcapital flows, whether of direct or portfolio investment.Mr. Wilson said that, whereas Dutch and European investors in general hadbeen free for some years to invest in the United States or other third countries ifthey wished to do so, British investors had not had that freedom. There might therefore be a pent-up demand which could lead at least initially to a substantialoutflow of capital if portfolio investment outwards were liberalised. But if Britainmaintained a higher interest rate than was needed for internal purposes, this mightstem the outward flow.Dr. Zijlstra said that, so long as there was not a net outflow of capital fromthe Community, there was no need to worry too much. The Community wouldbe readier to accept restrictions of capital movements than restrictions on trade:and there were still within the Community some national restrictions on inwardflows of capital.Mr. Wilson said that whereas Britain could prevent the take-over of british firms by outside interests, she encouraged inward investment which brought with it advantages such as technological knowledge and improvements in the quality of management.Technological developmentDr. Zijlstra then invited Mr. Wilson to speak about technological development.Mr. Wilson said that the previous evening he had given a number of figures toM. de Block which he had subsequently had checked. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentspent on technological research (excluding defence expenditure)  286 million, anincrease of one-third over the last two years. Of this,  129 million went to universities and Research Councils and to the Government-sponsored Institutefor Nuclear Research. An indication of the importance we attached to technologywas the establishment of the Ministry of Technology which now employed 7,600staff, excluding those engaged for contract work. On computers for universities and Research Councils, we should be spending  30 million over the next six years,and the Government itself spent between  6 million and  7 million a year oncomputers. Local authorities were being encouraged to instal computers at a cost of  3 million a year. Research funds were also being granted to the NationalResearch Laboratories to develop computers. Among the other interesting projectswe were developing was the fuel cell.In his speech at the Guildhall, he had referred to a technological Community.By this, he did not mean to imply that a fourth European Community dealingpurely with technology should be established, but rather that the technologicalwing of a merged Community should be developed if, at the time of britain&apos;s entry,there were one Community; if there were still three Communities, thenEURATOM might be strengthened by an injection of technological expertise.Britain welcomed Signor Fanfanfs proposal, although she doubted whether NATOwas the right forum for this work, and wished to encourage conversations betweenscientists and technologists of Community countries-. But major technologicalachievements going beyond such exchanges depended upon the achievement of acommon market for the products of technological innovation. British firms wanted to be assured of a bigger market for their products, and he had told general de Gaulle in Paris that we should not be willing to share our technological advances
if our products had to surmount a wall of external tariffs between the twoEuropean Communities; this was a factor which was also bound to limit bilateralco-operation in civil as well as military projects of a technologically advancednature.Dr. Luns said that some fears had been expressed that, if Britain entered theCommon Market, Britain and France might continue bilateral projects whichcould harm technological developments in the Netherlands, Belgium and luxembourg.Mr. Wilson said that they should not fear this: there was no doctrine ofexclusivity or duopoly in our minds. Britain was, for example, trying to promotetripartite development of some military aircraft of multilateral sales. It was truethat military aircraft tended to be ordered only by the Governments collaboratingin their production, but with private and civil projects, multilateral co-operation and a common market were essential.Dr. Luns said he hoped that Britain&apos;s trump card would not be committed inadvance of her entry into the Common Market because of bilateral projects in aircraft production.Institutional questionsDr. Luns then asked for Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs views on the question of majority decisions and the compromise reached at Luxembourg in February 1966.The Five contended that majority voting would become the rule as the Communitydeveloped and enlarged itself, whereas the French held the opposite view. Whenhe had served as President of the Council of Ministers, he had in fact been ableto accept majority voting on a number of points. Was it true that Britain favouredunanimity rather than majority voting?Mr. Wilson said that it was not for Britain, since she was not yet a memberof the Community, to intervene in the difference of opinion on this subject whichhad been registered in the Luxembourg agreement. He could say that onceBritain entered, she would accept the Treaty of Rome no less than other members.So long as she was not a member, she would not wish to add to the difficulties ofthe existing members by interfering in a domestic Community matter.Dr. Luns said that there was a strong body of opinion in the Netherlands toincrease the degree of European parliamentary control over the Community,especially in respect of the large sums which the Commission would control.Indeed the Dutch Government had accepted unanimously a resolution ofParliament to that effect.  Had Britain considered this matter?Mr. Wilson said that Her Majesty&apos;s Government had given some thought tothis question, but not as much as would be given if Britain were a member of theCommunity. Naturally, as prospectively a very large contributor, she would be interested in seeing that the funds of the Community were well spent; but again,it would be wrong for us to intervene before we became members.Dr. Luns recalled that there had been long discussions among the Six in thepast about ultimate political union in the Community. The original Fouchetproposals had been rejected by France because she did not agree with thesupranational ideas implicit in them. The Five had been disappointed at thisdecision. He recalled it because, in April, the new Netherlands Government wouldprobably wish to go as far as supporting the Second Fouchet Plan, especially ifBritain were a member of the Community. He recalled that in 1962-63 her majesty&apos;s Government of that time had agreed with the views of the Five on thismatter.Mr. Wilson said that Britain had been interested in the political unity ofEurope since the First Fouchet Plan, and had expressed the hope that Britainmight be associated with any talks about Europe&apos;s political future, even if she were at that stage not a member of the Community. Her Majesty&apos;s Government hadreceived no response to this approach.Dr. Luns suggested that the Ministerial meeting of WEU on 3rd and 4th Aprilmight provide a convenient opportunity for discussing Britain&apos;s soundings aboutentry.
Mr. Mulley said that it was to be hoped that either Mr. Brown or he would attend that meeting, and would welcome a discussion; but if the Six were to become involved in talks on this topic before Britain&apos;s application for entry it could delayconsideration of our application, should we decide to make one. Mr. Wilsonemphasised that it would be undesirable for any of these discussions to be usedin such a way as to prejudice Britain&apos;s position.Dr. Luns said that they would see to it that that would not happen. Thequestion of the fusion of the Executives had still not been solved; but there was arumour of a secret Franco-German agreement that Professor Hallstein shouldretire in September, and that an Italian should head a new and enlarged Executive.The Netherlands Government were bound to seek the approval of the DutchParliament for any fusion agreement before the exchanged instruments ratifying it.Mr. Wilson asked whether Dr. Luns could give any indication about therumour which had appeared in the Observer the previous day about a secretFranco-German agreement to keep Britain out. Was this mere sensationaljournalism or was there any foundation of fact in this story? He noted alsothat the Daily Telegraph that day had carried a story that the netherlands government were opposed to Britain&apos;s entry. Perhaps this was an erroneousimpression that could be corrected at the Press conferences which were to follow.Dr. Luns said that the Daily Telegraph story was completely contrary to the feelings of the Netherlands Government and he would controvert it at the press conference. Full information had been received from Bonn about the talks which mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown had conducted, and there was no indication at all ofa secret Franco-German agreement.European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)Dr. Luns asked whether Britain proposed to join the ECSC? HisGovernment were somewhat worried about the ECSC: it was the mostsupranational of all the Communities, and it was attempting to integrate supplyand demand within the Community in supply circumstances of great difficulty and with increasing closures of coal mines. Would Britain need a transitionalarrangement in order to adapt to the Treaty of Paris which set up the ECSC?Mr. Wilson agreed that the coal position was becoming increasingly difficult.We too were closing down uneconomic coalmines and transferring miners to more economic pits. Over the last 18 months, our closure programme had been speededup, with consequential social problems; and now, the discovery of large amounts of North Sea gas would further affect our coal and also other fuel industries. Wewere still appraising the implications for our energy programme and the part ofour National Plan which dealt with energy policy was now outdated. although he agreed with Dr. Luns that the ECSC was not the easiest^ of Communities todeal with, we would intend to play a full part in it if we applied for membership.Apprehensions that quantities of British coal would be dumped in the Communitywere exaggerated: our domestic market was our principal outlet, and we were currently exporting only three-quarters of a million tons a year to the Community,much of it in special types of coal. There was need for order in the coal market,and arrangements for that would need to be part of a wider European energyprogramme, which would require further examination whether Britain enteredor not. Mr. Brown and he would have the advantage of discussions with themembers of the ECSC Executive the following week when they visitedLuxembourg.Dr. Zijlstra agreed that a common energy policy, whether nuclearor traditional, was urgently needed.ConclusionDr. Luns said that it was desirable that at the two ensuing Press conferenceshe would firmly rebut any suggestion that the Netherlands Government opposed the British Governments intention of maintaining the momentum of their initiative, and would say that the Netherlands Government would support a Britishapplication for membership of the Community.
Dr. Zijlstra said that the discussions had been most fruitful, and had helped the Netherlands Government to understand more fully a number of points whichhad so far remained in doubt. He could assure Mr. Wilson that the netherlands government were extremely favourable towards British entry to the Community.Mr. Wilson said that he too had found the discussions extremely valuable.It had been most useful to draw on the experience of the Netherlands Government,who had been approached as friends and who had given helpful advice about future procedures. If shortage of time had prevented them from discussingpolitical matters as fully as they had discussed economic and agricultural matters,this did not in any way imply that either side underrated the importance of thepolitical development and influence of Europe. He thanked Dr. Zijlstra and hiscolleagues for their hospitality and for the time they had generously given to thediscussions.The meeting ended at 6.30 p.m.
RECORDS OF CONVERSATIONS IN LUXEMBOURGNOTE OF A CONVERSATION AT THE BRITISH EMBASSY,LUXEMBOURG, ON TUESDAY, 7th MARCH, 1967, AFTER DINNERPresent:The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, m p M. Pierre WernerThe Right Hon. George Brown, mp  M. GregoireH E Mr. D. Malcolm M. ClasenSir Burke Trend M. PescatoreSir Con 0&apos;neill mr. W. A. NieldProblems of United Kingdom entryMr. Wilson after expressing his pleasure at being in Luxembourg, said thathe hoped that on the following day it would be possible to discuss some of the issues which we regarded as the main problems in relation to our entry into the eec-the Common Agricultural Policy; capital movements; commonwealth interests, and so forth. We ourselves had come to believe that none of these problems need be insurmountable; and we had been impressed by the fact thatthe chief objection which was now being raised against our entry seemed tobe the fact that it would change the basic nature of the Community. Was this a real objection? We should be very grateful for the advice of LuxembourgMinisters about the best way of meeting it.Luxembourg&apos;s attitudeM. Werner said that, as British Ministers would know, they had the fullsympathy and support of the Luxembourg Government in their renewed attemptto enter the e.c.. The Luxembourg Government were convinced, as a resultof their own experience of the practical working of the Community, that everyproblem not excluding the difficult question of the Common Agricultural Policy could be solved provided that the political will to solve it existed. He would be particularly interested to hear from the Prime Minister on the following day thenature of the difficulty which we saw in relation to the question of capital movements.Capital movementsMr. Wilson briefly explained that for Britain this was essentially a questionof the opportunity which might be provided for portfolio investment to flow, via the e.c., to the United States and so to evade British exchange control.M. Werner said that this might raise the whole question of the relationship of sterling to the Community? Luxembourg permitted complete freedom of capital movements; and, if this freedom had to be made subject to some degree of restriction, this might be thought to imply that the Commission in Brussels would need to be invested with a new kind of supra-national authority going beyondanything which had hitherto been envisaged in the context of the integration ofthe financial and monetary policies of the members of the Community.Mr. Wilson replied that the problem might perhaps be tackled in terms of a transitional period for portfolio investment which would need to last until agreement had been reached on the type of permanent controls required.TechnologyMr. Wilson said it was important not to underrate the British argument onthis point, since it had a direct bearing on the whole question of Europeantechnological development. Europe must be prepared to compete with the UnitedStates in technology and, therefore, to create the right conditions for the intensiveinvestment which would be required for this purpose. The computer indusrty was an outstanding example in this context; and it was this thought which had;
prompted his own suggestion that something in the nature of a fourth community should be created. He had not used this term in any institutional sense. Hehad rather meant that the e.c. should concentrate on maximising its technologicalpotentialities; and this necessarily implied some degree of control over themovement of the capital which would be needed for this purpose. Britain couldcontribute a good deal to the technological development of Europe (includingnuclear technology, although we believed that the technological overspill from military nuclear development was small), provided that we were an integral memberof a market large enough to give our technological potential full scope.Commonwealth interestsMr. Brown said that we did not regard Commonwealth interests as aninsuperable obstacle to our entry to the e.c. though it was clear that some special arrangement would have to be made for New Zealand. Even here, however, avery long transitional period possibly of more than 20 years might suffice.Problems of the SixMr. Wilson asked what were likely to be the main problems for the Sixthemselves if we tried to enter the Community?M. Werner replied that they could be summed up as being the risk that theTreaty of Rome might be diluted into little more than a mere customs union which Britain and France together would dominate. But it was precisely thissharing of control which General de Gaulle foresaw and resented.It was agreed to continue the discussion in more detail on the following day.RECORD OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTERAND FOREIGN SECRETARY AND THE LUXEMBOURG PRIMEMINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER HELD IN THE &quot; TERREROUGE&quot;, LUXEMBOURG, ON WEDNESDAY, 8th MARCH, 1967,AT 10 a.m.Present:The Right Hon. Harold Wilson, mp    M. Pierre WernerThe Right Hon. George Brown, m pHE Mr. D. MalcolmSir Burke trend sir Con 0&apos;neill mr. W. A. nield mr. A. N. HallsMr. A. M. palliser mr. C. M. MacLehoseMr. T. Lloyd-hughes mr. D. J. D. maitland mr. N. Statham-Mr. W. K. ReidMr. R. LedererM. Pierre GregoireM. WehenkelM. PetitM. PescatoreM. ClasenM. BorschetteM. WagnerM. DuhrM. de MuyserM. Werner renewed the welcome he had given on the previous evening toMr. Wilson and Mr. Brown on their visit to Luxembourg, the last stage in theirtour of visits to capitals of the e.c.. He hoped that this stage would be successfulboth for bilateral relations between their two countries and for matters of majorEuropean concern. The fundamental position and the ideals of the LuxembourgGovernment were already known to Her Majesty&apos;s Government. Since 1962 whenthe possibility of Britain joining the Community had first been seriously discussed the position of the Luxembourg Government had not changed; but there had beenchanges in the political and economic situation of the world. He offered Britainhis Governments best wishes for the action they were now taking.
Mr. Wilson thanked M. Werner for the warm welcome which had been extended to the Foreign Secretary and himself and for the helpful informal talkswhich had taken place on the previous evening. He did not think it was necessaryto go over familiar ground since the Luxembourg Government would have read the statements he had made in the House of Commons in November 1966 and atthe Council of Europe meeting at Strasbourg in January 1967. They would also have had accounts of the progress of the talks in the other five capitals from her majesty&apos;s Ambassador and no doubt from the other members of the Community.The purpose of the visits was to explore the possibility of entering the e.c., providedthat Britain&apos;s essential interests could be safeguarded. The advice of theLuxembourg Government would be welcome when the British Cabinet came todetermine whether and when Britain should activate negotiations for entry.Understandably the discussions in the capitals of the Six had been occupied withthe difficulties which would occur if Britain applied for entry; but it was also important to take account of the value of her entry for the future of Europe. Itwas Britain&apos;s firm intent to enter the Community if her essential interests could be safeguarded. The Foreign Secretary and he would not have undertaken theirstrenuous but enjoyable round of visits had they not meant business. They had started with the knowledge that members of the Six had expressed the hope that britain would enter and that the Treaty of Rome fully allowed for the admissionof new members.The reports of the discussions which had already taken place would have made it clear that Her Majesty&apos;s Government did not consider the Treaty of Rome initself as presenting an impediment to our entry provided our essential interestscould be safeguarded. Most of the problems which had been discussed could be solved when the actual workings of the Treaty of Rome were examined closely.For example, the question of sterling and the implications of Article 108 of theTreaty did not now appear to present the difficulties which had at first beenforeseen.The main points of difficulty were the Common Agricultural Policy andespecially its financial regulations; certain aspects of capital movements;Commonwealth questions; and certain aspects of regional policy, although here again the further the talks had developed the more it had appeared that thedifficulties under the latter head would not be as great as we had feared.To list these main points did not mean that there were not other points of difficulty. But Her Majesty&apos;s Government envisaged that the negotiations forBritish entry, if Britain decided to activate them, would be concentrated on afew main issues and would not involve detailed discussion of what amounted to agrocery list. Many detailed matters had been discussed in 1962. Many problemshad altered since then, and many could be dealt with from the inside after Britain&apos;sentry. There would also be certain questions arising from harmonisationprocedures, e.g., it would be necessary to work out a timetable for adaptation tothe common external tariff. But that kind of question should not present major political difficulties.Mr. Wilson said that he was aware that in some quarters there was a feeling that Britain&apos;s entry would dilute and weaken the Community. To use a metaphorwhich had been employed in previous talks it had been suggested that, if morecoaches were added to the Community train, the train would find itself labouringor losing its sense of direction. It was true that additional coaches might be addedif Britain and some other countries joined, but there would be a more powerfulengine and the whole train would continue along the track already laid down. Inother words the accession of Britain would strengthen the Community and its purpose. The eventual size of the Community might amount to some 300 million people, providing the largest market in the free world apart from India. the concentration of skill and technological expertise would help Europe to becomestronger and economically more independent and thus to play a bigger and moreimportant role in the world. Those were material difficulties to be overcome butin discussing the future of the Community and of Europe it was important to remember that the political advantages and motivation of an enlarged community and a strengthened Europe were more important than the difficulties in the way.Institutional questionsM. Werner said that the Luxembourg Government had a positive approach to the question of Britain&apos;s entry. It considered that the Community could gain
substantially in strength and influence both politically and economically if Britainbecame a member. As one of the big Powers, her joining would present a completepicture of intra-European co-operation and would make Europe stronger in world affairs.One of his Governments concerns, however, was that the achievements ofthe Six in producing an advanced system of economic and political collaborationshould not be weakened by new institutional or legal problems which might arisethrough the addition of new members. He had been glad to hear from Mr. Wilsonthat he too was concerned that the efficiency and cohesion of the community should not suffer. The Community had now had much experience in solving the problems of individual member countries by negotiation. With goodwilltransitional arrangements could be agreed for all vital matters.Although most of the discussion would hinge on the Treaty of Rome, it was important not to forget the Treaty of Paris, especially since the prosperity ofLuxembourg was based on its Coal and steel production. Some of the principles ofthe Treaty of Paris were very important; in particular non-discrimination in marketing among members of the ECSC should be maintained; this was part ofthe philosophy which had been in the mind of the founding fathers of each of the communities and should not be forgotten. Collaboration among the signatories of the Treaties of Paris and of Rome should lead to closer co-operation in political matters among the Six, the Seven, the Ten or however many members there mightbe of an enlarged Community.The Luxembourg Government had received reports on the discussions whichhad taken place in the other capitals of the Six. He would not therefore wish to trouble Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown to repeat all the points they had made previously.Certain problems had become clearer in the course of the talks. He suggested thatinstitutional aspects of the Treaties should be discussed and then the major problems of agriculture, capital movements, Commonwealth trade and regional development. As he understood it, Britain accepted the principles of the Treatiesas they stood at present.Mr. Wilson said that she did, just as the Six did.M. Werner said that there had been certain developments which had gonebeyond the original Treaties, for example in the ECSC. Would Britain be preparedto collaborate in developments of that kind?Mr. Wilson said that Britain would consider it impertinent to express viewson any disagreements which had-arisen among the members of the Communitiesbut she would be prepared to play her full part in discussions and developmentif she were a member of the Communities. To revert to his earlier metaphor,one felt more sense of movement and acceleration in a train than if one stoodwatching it go by.M. Werner said that, when the question of majority voting had been debated in Luxembourg, the Six had come to the conclusion that they should state two different views in the same text. His Government considered this to be a falseproblem since they did not believe that one member country would be overruledby the other members of the Community where the vital interests of that community were concerned. But a Community could not be run without thesanction of majority voting, since otherwise there would be no arbitration of theproblems that arose in interpreting the original Treaty.Mr. Wilson said that it was helpful to have M. Werner&apos;s views on this; they represented a realistic way of looking at the problem. It seemed right that if a problem arose affecting the vital interests of one country then the other membersof. the Community should make every effort to meet these difficulties. On theother hand it would be wrong to disrupt the Treaty by pushing its national interestto the point of overriding the will of the Community as a whole. Where decisions had to be reached it was best to proceed in the sense of the whole meeting; butit might be that certain matters would have to.be decided by a vote. For thisreason he felt that M. Werner&apos;s position was realistic.M. Werner said that certain provisions of the Treaty of Rome involvedco-operation in matters which were not determined by the Treaty itself. trade policy was one; the Community had succeeded in taking a number of decisionsoh the Kennedy Round, but there were still large areas of trade policy which
were not covered by Community decisions, for example trade with Eastern europe and with under-developed countries. The Luxembourg Government felt thatcloser co-operation in these matters should be pursued. Would Britain see any difficulty in this?Mr. Wilson said he saw no problem for Britain in this proposition.M. Werner said that a problem might be created by the sovereign rights of states in relation to harmonisation of taxation. This was most likely to arisefjrst in relation to indirect taxation such as the turnover tax, but in due course the Community might feel the need for harmonisation of direct taxes, such asincome tax.Mr. Wilson said that if we were a member, of course Britain would accept theposition of the Community in this respect. The British Government were constantly examining their tax structure. As he had said in the summer of 1966,the Conservative Governments had rejected a value-added tax but his administration were looking again at this possibility. He understood that in the lasttwo weeks the Community had decided to move away from the &quot; cascade &quot; type of value-added tax. Indirect taxes were of course related to the freedom of trade withinthe Community, and, given time for transitional arrangements to operate, he would see no insuperable difficulty in harmonising indirect taxation. In the long term the same would apply to social taxation, involving payments by employers to finance social policies. If Britain joined the Common Market, and if there were no harmonisation of social taxation, British industry and the industry of the restof the Community would receive different treatment. He noted that the Treatyof Rome imposed no obligation to harmonise direct taxation; but if this weredesired in consonance with the spirit of the Treaty the British Government wouldplay its part in discussing the matter.Fusion of the CommunitiesM. Werner said that Mr. Wilson would be aware of the impending mergerof the Executives of the Communities. The Luxembourg Government were concerned that the merger of the Communities themselves should lead to a positionof strength rather than one of weakness. What was the British attitude to the merger?Mr. Wilson said that this was largely a question of the timing of our entry.Britain would be prepared to join the three separate Communities or one mergedCommunity depending upon the state of development at the time. Britain couldcertainly strengthen EURATOM, but she would be ready to play her part whetherthe Communities were separate or fused.M. Werner said that the British desire to strengthen EURATOM wouldmake the prospect of Britain joining the Communities, more attractive both tothe public opinion and the Governments of the Six. If Britain were able to bringher technological expertise into the Communities it would be of great importance.Mr. Wilson said that his purpose in his Guildhall speech in 1966 had not been to propose the establishment of a fourth and separate Community for technology,but to advocate the strengthening of the technological content of the community or Communities. The whole of Europe needed a larger market for the products of technology. If the Community were enlarged to a figure approaching300 million persons, it would provide a market large, enough to justifymanufacturers taking risks in deploying resources on major technological research and development which in a smaller market would prove a much more hazardousoperation. He cited as an example the fact that, when the Labour Governmenthad come into office, they had decided to abandon work on the TSR-2 which hadtaken  750 million expenditure in research and development, although the market for the aircraft was restricted to the RAF. Her Majesty&apos;s Government had nowundertaken joint defence projects with the French Government which would halvethe cost and double the market for military aircraft since both the French andBritish Air Forces would use the products of this particular branch of technology.In computer technology none of the European countries could compete by&apos;t?elf on equal terms with the United States; but if there were a market of some300 million persons Europe could compete successfully. If Europe were not inthe forefront of technological development by the 1970s, she would become a
second-class technological area relying on the United States for new developments and producing herself only those traditional goods which she had produced 20 years earlier. Technological co-operation on the necessary scale would not be feasiblein a divided Europe, no matter how many learned papers were read by professorsor how much advice was communicated by scientific attaches. Our businessmenwould not take the risk of incurring substantial expenditure on research anddevelopment if they had to compete with United States firms and face the sametariff barrier as the Americans faced because of non-membership of the common market.M. Werner said he agreed: and suggested the meeting should now discussagricultural problems.Agricultural problemsMr, Brown said that there were four related problems in agriculture, none of which in the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government required changes in the Treatyof Rome, or in the Community&apos;s institutions. They were of varying degrees of difficulty and he proposed to set them out in ascending order of difficulty.(i) The effect on the cost of food and the cost of living. If Britain switchedto the Community system with its higher prices, this would have a substantialeffect on our price levels, estimated at 10-14 per cent as regards the increased cost of food and 3-34- per cent as regards the rise in the cost of living. he understood that the calculations made by the Commission were roughly the sameas those made by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. If the change could be made over a long period these increases would be relatively unimportant; if they weremade over a short period, the effect in Britain could be severe. The length ofthe transitional period would therefore be of considerable importance.(ii) The distorting effect on the pattern of British agricultural production. IfCommunity and world prices of agricultural products remained at their present level the overall profitability of British agriculture would probably be no worse than at present but there would be changes in the pattern. The level of community prices would stimulate cereal production and would depress some,but not all, livestock production. The smaller farmers tended to be livestockproducers: this meant that the Government would have to face a considerableseries of structural changes within the pattern of British agriculture. Thewestern and northern parts of Britain had climatic and soil conditions which were relatively unsuitable for cereal production. It would take time to carry throughthe structural changes which would be needed for encouraging smaller farmers to merge and to adapt their production to the Community&apos;s agricultural policy by. changes in production, by amalgamations, by co-operative systems. such changes would require both time and financial assistance, and Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should be enabled to recoup some of the levy payments made to.the Agriculture Fund in order to finance these changes. There was also aquestion whether to avoid depopulating the poorer parts of Britain special grants,e.g., for those who would otherwise have to leave unrewarding farms would be acceptable under the Community regulations. He considered that ways could befound to assist the necessary structural changes without breaking either the letteror the spirit of the Treaty of Rome; Her Majesty&apos;s Government hoped that thiswould be acceptable to the Community.(iii) The effect on Commonwealth suppliers. Acceptance of the common agricultural Policy would produce a number of Commonwealth problems, forexample, in relation to the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. Presumably the kinds of association which had been discussed in the 1962 negotiations would beavailable to Commonwealth countries in Africa and the Caribbean. It seemed likely that these would present no substantial problem. The real problem aroseover supplies of agricultural produce from New Zealand. (Supplies from Australiaand Canada would present difficulties but they should not present insuperable difficulties.) New Zealand depended on her exports of temperate foodstuffs to theBritish market. This meant that provision would have to be made to ensure accessfor the agricultural products of New Zealand to Britain and the Common Marketon no less generous a basis than she enjoyed at present. The method of arrangingthis would have to be discussed if negotiations were begun. Something more thana transitional arrangement would be necessary: a Morocco-type protocol might
be a possibility or some arrangement which guaranteed access for New Zealandproducts to the Community market. Britain could not let New Zealand down inthis respect.(iv) The effect of the present agricultural financial arrangements on Britain&apos;balance of payments. Her Majesty&apos;s Government assumed that she would payher contribution to the Agriculture Fund under the &quot;key&quot; system of apportionment.If no changes were made in the present arrangements, Britain would, under the90 per cent levy arrangement, have to pay in levies a very substantial sum acrossthe exchanges. Taking the higher prices, the national contribution and the leviesinto account, this would involve Britain in a charge to her balance of payments of 175 million at the lowest estimate and  250 million at the highest. The end result might be somewhere between these two figures with which the Commission had expressed themselves as being broadly in agreement. The problem lay in the size of the payments and in their unfairness. Britain would have to pay as much as allthe present members of the Six together and would contribute some 35 per cent of the total Fund; in view of the size of the payment and its inequitability some change seemed to be called for. He imagined that the Fund would not have been drawn up on its present basis had there been more than six members of theCommunity at the very beginning. In the event of accession by Britain and other european countries therefore, it would seem desirable to have a further look both at the size of the Fund and at the relative levels of contribution to it; and it wasconvenient that the whole question of financing was due to be re-negotiated in1969.If there was a common will to solve these financial aspects of the common agricultural Policy a solution could be found without changing its purposes and principles. These were the four main problems which Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentforesaw in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy.M. Werner said this was a complex problem and it was necessary to distinguish between its various aspects. The Common Agricultural Policy had a basicphilosophy which the Six regarded as definitive, and applicable not only in the transitional stage to 1970 but thereafter. They regarded the system of levies andthe provision of compensation for exports as a suitable and desirable one for theCommunity. There was also provision for funds to be made available foragricultural development in order to solve the special problems of individual countries and to enable them to cope with the conversion to Community policies.Whilst the transitional stage was still running the special arrangements operated.In arriving at these arrangements the individual interests of the Communitymembers had had to be taken into account and careful compromises achieved.He wished to ask whether Britain objected to the system of levies and interventionsas a major element in the agricultural policy at the final single market stage, afterBritain had become a full member. He stressed that he recognised the problems which the Common Agricultural Policy presented for Britain. There were problems which could be dealt with by transitional periods, and there were problems also of structural alteration. But the question was what Britain could accept in thefinal stage of the Community&apos;s development. Arrangements could be made todeal with transitional difficulties but he did not see how it was possible to overturnthe Community&apos;s basic philosophy.Mr. Wilson said that he must in a sense be expressing a personal opinion in replying to M. Werner&apos;s question because no decision had been taken by theBritish Government whether or not to seek membership of the Community. Butif the Cabinet decided to apply for entry he thought it would have to be on thebasis that we accepted the principles of the system described by M. Werner. Itwould not, he thought, be realistic to say that we wanted to enter the Communityprovided that there could be a totally different agricultural system though if wehad been members of the Community at an earlier stage then we might well have wished to see a different system introduced. But the amounts of the levies thatwould be payable might be a different question. How far this question could beleft until 1969 when we might already be members of the Community, how far the key of national contributions might be adjusted, how far the problems mightbe solved by transitional periods, what length these transitional periods should beand the extent to which our system of production grants might be maintainedwere all questions for discussion in negotiation.
Mr. Brown said he agreed that the Community system was not ideal for britain but he thought we could adjust to it. Even so, the four problems that hehad mentioned needed to be dealt with satisfactorily in one way or another.Mr. Wilson said that when Germany had pressed for a ceiling on hercontributions to the common agricultural fund he understood that this had notbeen taken by the other members of the Community as involving a derogationfrom the system, but rather as meeting a special problem. On that basis we wouldnot need a derogation either; but we would need special decisions to deal withspecial problems which arose in our case.M. Werner said that it had been agreed that from the beginning of the singlemarket stage in the Community all levies would be payable to the Community.If we accepted this position without derogation, he could not think that therewould be any difficulties. He imagined it would be possible to find special arrangements covering transitional periods, provided it was clear what we could accept in the final stage. He stressed the undesirability of looking at the presentsituation as a static one. We had made our calculations, based on the presentsituation. But the Community would change; there would be new developments.There would be new opportunities for British agriculture. In Luxembourg theyhad had the problem of persuading farmers that if they were prepared to specialisethere would be new opportunities. Perhaps the problem was not so big as we thought it might be.Mr. Brown said he wished to make it quite clear that in making the estimates that he had quoted we had made an allowance for changes in British agricultural production, for changes in import requirements, and for the possibility ofadditional exports, as favourable to ourselves as was prudent. He had beeninterested to discover that the Commission^ estimates of the amount of levypayments which Britain would have to make were much higher than our own;and he imagined that the difference represented the allowance that we had madefor changes. Thus the figures he had quoted were genuine ones involving full allowance for any changes which might reasonably be expected to assist us.He said that, if we accepted the basis of the Common Agricultural Policy,then of course we should have to accept that all levies would have to be paid overto the Community. What seemed to be still open for discussion however was theamount that might be paid back to Britain for other purposes. It was the net contribution that was important. And for us to be making a net contributiontwice that of Germany was in his view altogether inequitable.M. Werner said that the way in which the problem had now been put seemedto present it in a much more acceptable light. The Community clearly envisagedpayments to individual Governments for agricultural purposes. What Mr. Brownhad just said seemed to offer a much more promising basis for negotiation.Mr. Wilson confirmed that we were interested, less in the system and the wayit operated than in the final net amount which we should be required tocontribute. It might be satisfactory if that requirement were limited. We wereafter all talking in terms of a marriage between the Community and Britain.You might prefer the girl you were marrying to have blue rather than grey eyesbut you could not insist on her changing the colour of her eyes before youmarried her. Thus, although we did not regard the Community&apos;s common agricultural Policy as an ideal system we recognised that it was scarcely possibleto require that it should be changed upon our entry.The question of production grants was important. We recognised that if we entered the Community deficiency payments would have to disappear. But wewould like the question of production grants to be examined very carefully. we made them, for instance, to hill farmers in areas which presented difficult social and, to some extent, nationalistic problems. And every pound by which the grants could be increased would reduce the net balance of payments burden onBritain. We were applying a deflationary policy in Britain at the moment. Someexperts estimated that it was necessary to cut production by  500 million inorder to cut the balance of payments deficit by  50 million. Such cuts broughtwith them disagreeable consequences such as unemployment. If we were requiredto accept as the cost of the Common Agricultural Policy anything like the figures which Mr. Brown had mentioned this would mean holding back production,
investment, and technological development in Britain in order to find thenecessary money. It was true that we would hope to increase our industrialexports to the Community; but we should also increase our imports from theCommunity. Thus we could not just set industrial advantages againstdisadvantages in the agricultural sector. To find the money needed to cover thecost of the Common Agricultural Policy would represent a very heavy additional burden upon Britain.M. Werner agreed that deficiency payments would have to be excluded.But the Commission was at present discussing what kinds of grants to farmersmight be permissable. No final arrangements had been agreed within the Six.Solhere was a margin available for negotiation, definition and study. In answer to a question from Mr. Brown, he confirmed that it did not seem to him thatthe agricultural problems were insurmountable if we were able to accept the basic philosophy of the agricultural policy.M. Werner said that he recognised the special problem of New Zealand,which he understood to be limited to agricultural produce. Were there other commonwealth problems which might present major difficulty? Mr. Brown said he did not think so, provided it could be assumed that the offers of association and the other arrangements envisaged during the course of the 1961-63 negotiations could be carried over.Mr. Wilson added that association would reduce the difficulties of some commonwealth countries, but sugar might remain a problem, especially for someWest Indian territories. The difficulties arising from the Community&apos;s present arrangements on sugar could disappear if a really effective world sugar agreement were made. But this would require time. Mr. Wilson agreed also, in answer to aquestion from M. Werner, that an effective cereals agreement within the kennedy round would also help in dealing with Commonwealth questions. But some of the changes that might be expected in British agricultural production might produce a difficult situation in the Community. We in Britain were low-cost producers of cereals; and we might even find ourselves in the position of exporting cerealsto France. Of course this position might be affected by the level of prices setwithin the Community. M. Werner said that price levels would be open to discussion once we were in the Community.M. Werner asked whether there were any special questions affecting EFTAwhich we wished to discuss. Mr. Wilson said we were in close consultation withour EFTA colleagues but we were not speaking on their behalf.In answer to M. Werner&apos;s invitation to explain the problems connected withcapital movements, Mr. Wilson said that we drew a distinction between direct investment and portfolio investment, and he understood the regulations made underthe Treaty of Rome did the same. There were of course risks connected with thefreedom of direct investment, but all the present members of the Community hadtaken such risks. There was a risk that British direct investment, in the community would be greater than the Community&apos;s direct investment in Britain, but as thecontrary was also possible, that risk might be taken; he would expect substantialmovements in both directions. This freedom of direct investment could only be advantageous to the development of the expanded Community. In any case therewas some safeguard in that additional investment could be expected from outsidethe Community, principally from the United States, in both Britain and the presentCommunity countries.Freedom of portfolio investment presented a more difficult problem. Wediscouraged such investment at the moment by our taxation system, and by whatamounted to a system of currency discounts for investment purposes abroad (larger than those which the Community seemed to regard as permissible). We did notfear the results of freeing portfolio investment between Britain and the Six. Againthere would be a movement in both directions, though perhaps in the earlier yearsafter our entry the movement from Britain to the Community would be the greateras our investors took advantage of the new freedom they had gained. This problem could be dealt with by a transitional period. We were, however, much more concerned lest freedom of portfolio investment within the Community might provide an escape route for British capital to the United States by means of an organised traffic which could involve transfers arranged by telephone in a matterot minutes. We thought this was a problem not only for us but for Europe as a
whole. We did not see it as the responsibility of Europe to provide savings forthe United States; we thought that the expanded Community might betterconcentrate upon its own technological and industrial development. We might thus well wish to press for restrictions on portfolio investment in third countries.We should certainly wish to harmonise our practice with that of present community countries, but we should remain anxious unless this problem could be satisfactorilyovercome.M. Werner said that Articles 67-73 of the Treaty detailed the obligations inthis field to which Community members were committed. He thought that these articles also provided the necessary machinery to overcome our concern. Thegeneral principle outlined in Article 70 was that the highest possible degree of liberalisation should exist, but this was merely a goal which the Community were still in process of achieving gradually. There were differences of view about it inthe Community and they could move only as the overall economic situationdeveloped favourably. The degree of liberalisation within the Community was still greater than that applied towards third countries, so that differential treatment was nothing new. The whole problem of capital movements was dominated by the overall financial situation of the major members of the Community. If Britainentered the Community there would be additional factors represented by the Britishbalance of payments, the sterling balances, and the general problem of sterlingas a reserve currency. So that in considering the question of capital movementsit was impossible to avoid asking at the same time how we saw the whole questionof the management of sterling, and how it would be fitted into the economy of theCommunity. There had not been much progress within the Community so far in the monetary field, but as soon as an important currency such as the pound were brought within the Community it would give rise to additional problems and complications.Perhaps, too, complications for the existing members of the Community would arise in that the British situation would affect the position of other countries. Therewas, for instance, Article 108 of the Treaty, which provided for mutual assistancein balance of payments difficulties.Mr. Wilson agreed this was a very important problem and that the wholequestion of capital movements was linked to other aspects of economic management.Articles 67-73 of the Treaty envisaged a common policy on capital movementsinvolving the highest possible degree of liberalisation. We were concerned not only with the existing machinery but with the intentions of the Community. many problems would become easier if moves towards the creation of greaterinternational liquidity, not directly linked with the present discussions, were successful. If the International Monetary Fund and the Group of Ten could make progress towards a more modern system of international liquidity then it wouldbe possible to take a more relaxed view of the question of capital movements,including that of portfolio investment.Mr. Wilson said that it was necessary to distinguish between the position of sterling as a concomitant of the British balance of payments and movements of sterling arising from the currency&apos;s wider role. Basically the strength of sterlingdepended upon Britain&apos;s balance of payments. Here there had been a dramaticimprovement over the last few years. The deficit on Britain&apos;s balance of payments in 1964 had been of the order of  800 million, the biggest in our peacetimehistory. It would have been around  830 million if the interest due on the UnitedStates loan had been paid. In 1965 the deficit had been  370 million. No finalfigures were available for 1966, but there had been a further dramatic reductionin the deficit, especially in the last months of the year. The balance of paymentswas especially dependent upon the trade balance. This had never been in surplus in our recent history. In 1964 the deficit on visible trade had been of the orderof  45 million a month; in 1965 this had been halved to  23 million; and in 1966halved again to  12 million. In the last quarter we had probably been in surplus.Nor had the full effects of the internal measures taken in July 1966 yet become apparent. The Government had never shrunk from taking the unpopular measures necessary to improve the situation, and he believed the country accepted theGovernments position on this.As regards the British balance of payments, we should, if we joined theCommunity, be in the same position under Article 108 of the Treaty as any other member country. But we did not look to this article for relief if problems arose from external causes deriving from sterling^ role as an international currency.
He thought that the Community might have had some anxiety on this scorebecause of the wording of Article 108 (i) of the Treaty which referred to problems arising because of the &quot; type of currency &quot; at a country&apos;s disposal. The words inthe Treaty had not beeen drafted to cover a position such as that of Britain andthe role of sterling. They had been designed to deal with a regime in whichnon-convertible currencies were still frequently held. Since the drafting of theTreaty, Western European currencies had all become convertible and if the Treatywere being drafted to-day perhaps the passage to which he had drawn attentionwould not be included. The words of the Treaty might, taken literally and if weinsisted on them, be of value to us, but after deep consideration he was boundto say that it would seem wrong to invoke this article to deal with problems arisingbecause of movements in the sterling balances or other comparable externaldevelopments. The biggest insurance against any undue movement of this kindwas a strong British balance of payments. But the kind of problem which could arise, e.g., from a drought in Australia and reduced income from wool sales did not,in his view, appropriately fall to be dealt with under Article 108. When there hadbeen difficulties over sterling in the last two years, arising, admittedly, from ourown balance of payments problem, they had been solved by Central Banks andby international arrangements going far beyond Europe. When Italy had hadbalance of payments problems the measures taken to deal with them had beeninternational and not been confined to the Six; the United States and Britain, forexample, had also participated.It was now recognised by financiers and bankers generally that when anycurrency was in trouble for reasons which could be overcome, then the problem was one which needed to be dealt with by general action. We could consider making it clear in any negotiation that difficulties arising for the United Kingdomout of sterling&apos;s wider role would not involve the invocation of Article 108 eventhough member countries of the existing Community might indeed wish tohelp in such circumstances.M. Werner thanked Mr. Wilson for his explanation, which greatly clarifiedthe position. But was it possible to separate out the British balance of payments position from the wider problems involved with the role of sterling? Mr. Wilsoncommented that international financial authorities had recently become very skilfulin distinguishing between the various factors at work. Under the recent Baslearrangement credit was made available to the extent of any reduction in the sterling balances. Balance of payments problems were dealt with through theIMF. If of course any difficulties which arose in future were attributable to ourown balance of payments then we should be in the same position as any otherCommunity country.M. Werner believed that it would be desirable to agree an interpretativedocument on this subject during any negotiations, and Mr. Wilson confirmed thatwe would be prepared to discuss the point.Reverting to the narrower question of capital movements, M. Werner said he wished to remind us that there were provisions in the Treaty (Article 70 (2) whichhe quoted) to cover preoccupations on this score. Mr. Wilson agreed that therewas machinery which could deal with the problem if it were appropriately used.He did not wish to prejudge any eventual negotiation with the Community, but hethought that one possible way of handling the question might be a transitional period which would remain in force until Community arrangements had beenmade to deal with it. M. Werner said that a member State had full autonomyunder Article 70 (2) to deal with the question, subject only to consultation withother member States. Mr. Wilson agreed that if there were a serious run on sterlingowing to this cause steps would have to be taken to deal with it.M. Werner said that he thought closer co-operation on monetary andfinancial matters within the Community would be essential if Britain joined, sincethe whole background would have changed.  Mr. Wilson agreed.M. Werner said he wanted to,raise a question of concern to the LuxembourgGovernment regarding the development of the steel industry. He feared therewas a tendency for some present members of the Community to become less liberaland to think in terms of separating the individual markets of the Community, as opposed to the present unified market system. The British steel industry was very powerful.  He hoped that in accordance with our traditions the British attitude
to the problems would be a liberal one like that of the Luxembourg Government:there should be one market, as provided for under the Treaty, with equal access to raw materials and with the opportunity for all to sell under fair and equalconditions. Despite recent illiberal tendencies in the Community, he was happy to say that the recent agreement upon a system of compensation for coking coalhad overcome some part of the present problem in a way which assured a freemarket without discrimination.M. Werner recalled also that the Treaty of Paris made provisions for dealingwith dominant positions in the steel market. The Luxembourg government thought this was an important element of the Treaty and that everything shouldbe done to avoid the establishment of dominant positions. He enquired whether,in our view, the nationalisation of steel in Britain might lead to the establishmentof such a dominant position.Mr. Wilson said he understood that public ownership was not prohibitedunder the Treaty (M. Werner assented). The reorganisation of the steel industry would involve the establishment of four main groups, which he did not think wouldbe bigger than some of the groups at present operating in Western Europe. Inany case, he wished to assure M. Werner that the steel industry in Britain would operate in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty. There might even be some who would think that the British steel industry was a greater danger to community markets if we were outside the Community than if we were members.But we saw the need for orderly handling of the position. He recalled that the steel industry in one member of the Community had recently received a large loanat lower than market rates. We had not done anything comparable in our ownsteel industry.M. Werner said there was no time to summarise the results of the meeting.The discussion could be carried on after lunch informally or formally and it wouldthen be possible to agree on precise conclusions for public use. But he wished tosay that, in his view, the present discussions had clarified many questions andhad been generally very positive. M. Gregoire said that he would like to raisesome political questions during or after lunch.Mr. Wilson agreed that the morning session had been an extremely useful one.The meeting finished at 12 noon.

Coppe and the other members of the High Authority.He said that in his tour of European capitals he and the Foreign Secretary had now had the opportunity of meeting all six Heads of Government and had had a shortmeeting with members of the Commissions of the European Economic community and EURATOM. Our intention to enter the European Economic Community,provided that our difficulties could be satisfactorily met, involved, as matters nowstood, entry to all three European Communities. But there was, of course, thequestion of timing; it was the intention of the Communities, he understood, thatthe three Executives should shortly be merged. Of course, we intended to achievefull membership of all three Communities, if our problems could be solved. Hewould be grateful if he could learn from the members of the High Authority someof the difficulties which they foresaw, and which we should bear in mind in the context of our eventual entry into the ECSC.Attitude of the High AuthorityM. Coppe said he and his colleagues were very happy to have theopportunity of meeting Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown. Mr. Wilson had referred tothe merger of the Executives. He expected this would take place in a few weeksor months. But, of course, it was only a first step towards the more important question of merging the Communities themselves. He would like to call on hiscolleagues to speak in greater detail upon more specific points. But, in the caseboth of coal and, to some extent, steel, the development in the ECSC had proceededsomewhat beyond what had been expected under the Treaty. A number of exceptional escape clauses had been applied recently because of the situation in both the coal and steel sectors. The Treaty prohibited subsidies. But in factevery coal mining enterprise had subventions of one kind or another, and recoursehad been had to a clause in the Treaty which permitted this sort of development.There had recently been an agreement in the Council of Ministers on subsidies forcoking coal. They had been able to agree on how these subsidies would be paid,their maximum extent, and how the money would be found. A system ofcompensation for coking coal exported within the Community would also bejnvolved. In the steel sector an almost totally harmonised tariff had been achieved.They were trying also to achieve greater discipline in production in this sector.
The problem of British accession to the ECSC did not therefore involve onlyaccession to the Treaty but also acceptance of the way in which the community had ^ developed. It had not always been easy to get agreement upon the applications of exceptions, but as he had said some exceptions were now in force the question of coking coal to which he had referred and arrangements forimportation of steel from East European countries were examples.Kennedy RoundM. Coppe said he would ask M. Wehrer to speak about the Kennedy Roundwhich was a subject of immediate importance on which, in the steel sector, theHigh Authority were spokesmen for the Community.M. Wehrer said that the discussions on steel in the Kennedy Round at Genevawere now in a difficult phase. We would remember that the mandate given tothe High Authority by the Council of Ministers had led to their taking as theirbase rate the 14 per cent recognised as the Community&apos;s legal tariff when they had obtained a waiver in GATT. They had offered to cut this 14 per cent base rate by50 per cent, and had said immediately that their final objective was a harmonisedtariff involving all large producers and exporters in applying a comparable customstariff. There had been at the outset much opposition to the position which theCommunity had adopted. The British Delegation in particular had reminded them of the actual level of the Community&apos;s harmonised tariff, which was of the orderof 6-8 per cent, and had objected to the use of 14 per cent as a base rate. But,M.. Wehrer added, that when the reduction in Community tariffs had been madein 1958, this had been a unilateral decision on their part. Most countries had notoffered a counterpart. Only the United Kingdom had responded by making areduction in its own tariff at that time. If the British Delegation now insisted that further reductions needed to be made beyond the effective level to which theCommunity tariff had then been reduced, this would produce an impossible situation.The Governments of member countries could not accept 3 per cent or thereabouts(the rate which would be produced by making a further cut of 50 per cent) as thelevel of their protection when much higher tariffs continued to be applied in other states, and when a tariff of 3 per cent provided no effective protection at all.In consequence, he had hoped that the question of the base tariff had been removed from the area of discussion; the idea upon which the discussions had laterconcentrated was that of seeing whether there was any basis for harmonisation of tariffs between the major producers. This idea had met with a not unfavourableresponse from most countries, but the United Kingdom Delegation had insisted on its previous attitude. The American Delegation had then suggested the ideaof a target rate and discussions were proceeding upon this basis. But he understood, from the latest reports he had had from Geneva, that there was stillresistance on the part of the British Delegation to this idea.M. Wehrer feared that if it was impossible to arrive at a satisfactory settlement there would be complete failure of the Kennedy Round in the steelsector. He could not say what the repercussions might be elsewhere. He thoughtthat if it was possible to reach agreement upon a common or harmonised tariff,the possible check to the progress of the Kennedy Round might be avoided.There followed a general discussion during which M. Wehrer made clearthat the Community&apos;s present effective tariff rate was on average 9 per cent (havingbeen increased from the figure of 6-3 per cent); M. Coppe said that what theywere aiming at was a figure of around 5 per cent for the Community and theycould not go lower than this; M. Wehrer noted that the Community wished tomaintain a flexible attitude and their minds were not closed towards making further offers in particular areas; and Mr. Brown said that the difficulty was thatwe had offered a 50 per cent reduction in our own existing rates of tariff, whichwas what the Kennedy Round foresaw, and we thought it was uo to the community to make further moves. M. Wehrer objected that British tariffs were higher thanCommunity tariffs.M. Coppe said he did not think it was useful to pursue the discussion further(it had been said earlier that it would he desirable to leave the question to the negotiators in the Kennedy Round) but added that he could not see why we wished to place pressure upon the Community to reduce their tariffs furtherif we ourselves expected shortly to be members of the Community.
Mr. Wilson said that this was certainly a dilemma in that what was desirablefrom the United Kingdom point of view whilst outside the Community might notexactly coincide with her interests inside. But he attached the highest importanceto a successful outcome of the Kennedy Round.Mr. Brown said that the Kennedy Round must not be impeded by thediscussions on our own entry. We believed that it was for the Community tomake a further move if there was to be a satisfactory outcome in the steel sector.Problems of United Kingdom entryMr. Wilson enquired what difficulties the Community would see as regardsBritish entry. M. Coppe said that the volume of United Kingdom coal production,all under the control of the National Coal Board, was a real problem. But duringthe previous negotiations they had thought, and they still thought, that the question could be solved. A similar problem arose in connection with steel nationalisation.25 million tons of steel produced under one owner also constituted a block of a sizewhich the Community was not used to.Mr. Wilson pointed out that the nationalised steel industry would only betaking over the largest firms, and that it would be organised into four producinggroups; and so far as he knew none of them would be significantly larger than some of the groups in the Community. M. Coppe said that if these groups weretotally independent of each other then no problem would arise. If they werenot independent of each other then there would be a problem, but he believedthat the Community would be able to handle it. Special arrangements had beenmade in the case of Charbonnages de France to avoid any misuse of a dominantposition within the Community. He repeated that although there were problems,he was confident they could be dealt with.Mr. Brown said that the groups in the British nationalised steel industry wouldnot be totally independent of each other, but equally the industry would not bemonolithic. Herr Hellwig said that under Community doctrine one owner was treated as one unit. The NCB might produce the same amount of coal as thetotal produced within the Community at the moment. M. Coppe and Herr Hellwigsaid that they expected that coal production in the Community would be 170-190million tons by 1970, and might undergo further reductions after 1970. HerrHellwig said that he thought that the economic problem presented by the accession of so large a volume of production as that of the United Kingdom would not beany reason for the Community to refuse British membership, but ways and means,including transitional periods, must be found to provide solutions to the marketproblem.There was agreement that transitional periods were desirable, not only inthe interest of the United Kingdom, but in the interest also of the Community.There followed a brief discussion about stocks in the coaLindustry and unusedcapacity in the steel industry.Mr. Wilson asked what the High Authority&apos;s advice would be on the manner of a new application. M. Coppe suggested that there was no point in waiting for further developments within the Community; the Community progressed thewhole time. Nor could there be any question merely of intensifying or amplifyingthe activities of the present Council of Association. Common solutions for coal and steel problems were necessary. But he and Herr Hellwig agreed with thePrime Minister that the operations of the Council of Association had been ofgreat help and made the possibility of speedy agreement with the Communityeasier in that each side well knew the problems of the other. Herr Hellwigsuggested that the last negotiations did not perhaps offer much help. There hadbeen provisional results in the steel sector, but the shape of our nationalised industry might affect these results; and coal had not been discussed properly inthe last negotiations, which had not proceeded beyond the stage of fact-findingwhen they were suspended. M. Coppe, in answer to a question from Sir JamesMarjoribanks, said that it was his opinion that the negotiations should be keptas short at possible.   Mr. Wilson said this was fully his intention.Mr. Wilson enquired whether pricing policies had been a problem in thelast negotiations. Herr Hellwig said that on steel they had not been, but theNational Coal Board&apos;s system had presented  rather more difficulty.  But
transitional periods could adequately cover any problems. The Community didnot exercise any control over retail prices but was based on pithead prices with full publicity being given to freight tariffs. If Britain entered the Communityif would be necessary to look at the question of rates for movement by sea; sea transport was not covered at the moment by the Community&apos;s freight regulations.M. Coppe said it was his view that all the problems could be solved once theUnited Kingdom became a member of the Community. The Treaty of Parisprovided powers to deal with most situations. Certainly unanimity was requiredfor the application of exceptions, and thus long discussions were required. Butit was fully possible to solve virtually every problem within the framework ofthe Treaty of Paris and he did not doubt that any problems could be overcomeonce the United Kingdom had joined the Community.In answer to a question by Mr. Wilson about national subsidies within thethe Community M. Coppe said that the French applied a differential system ofinterest rates. So far there was no harmonisation of monetary policy withinthe Communities and a cheap loan, with a rate of interest below the normalmarket rate, could not be objected to by the ECSC if there was no objection toit by the e.c. in Brussels.There was some discussion of the Community&apos;s Guarantee Fund, which had originally been financed by levies on steel production. Herr Hellwig said that itwould be open to us to &quot; buy a share &quot; in the Fund; but he did not think that itwould be possible to set off payments under the Community&apos;s agricultural policyagainst any payment involved in &quot; buying this share &quot;. The ECSC Fund wasthe property of the coal and steel industry and he did not think it possible toarrange offsets in this way.Common energy policyIn answer to a question from Sir Con 0&apos;Neill about the establishment of acommon energy policy, Herr Hellwig said that this depended upon theestablishment of a common import policy. Of course it raised problems goingfar beyond the ECSC alone. M. Coppe said that the Communities were not infavour of protection of the energy market. The High Authority had advocatedthat there should be no protection at the borders, and this philosophy was now generally accepted within the Communities. Of course there was still internaltaxation.There was some discussion of the relative roles which coal, water, atomic energy, oil and gas would play in a common energy policy. Herr Hellwig saidthat 1970 would be a critical year for decision on coal policy since atomic energymight be commercially economic by that time. M. Coppe added that theCommunity had already decided that it would be incorrect to defend the positionof coal producers as if the whole energy future of, the Community depended on it.The meeting finished at 5.20 p.m.
