THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) 167^22 COPY NO,   661st March, 1967CABINETIRON AND STEEL NATIONALISATION; NATIONAL.STEEL CORPORATION salaries memorandum by the Minister of power the Prime Minister had asked that the question of NationalSteel Corporation Salaries should be brought to Cabinet on the basisof proposals I had agreed with the First Secretary of State and theChancellor of the Exchequer and which are outlined in the paper at annex,Since this paper was prepared, however, Lord Melchett,Chairman of the Organising Committee, has told me that the salariesindicated in paragraph 10 of the paper, if approved by the Government,would depress the salary levels lower down in the industry to an extent which would make it impossible to retain or secure staff of the requiredquality.    He would therefore wish to resign and believes that the bulkof the Organising Committee would not be willing to serve,I am discussing this further with Lord Melchett and will reportthe position to my colleagues when the paper is discussed.R. W. MMinistry of Power, S, W, 1.1st March, 1967
CABINETIRON AND STEEL NATIONALISATION:  NATIONALSTEEL CORPORATION salaries memorandum by the Minister of power the Cabinet considered last September (CC(66) 48th Conclusions,Minute 5) the question of the salaries to be paid to members of theNational Steel Corporation;   the Cabinet then settled the salary to be offered to the future Chairman of the Corporation but agreed to determineat a later date the salaries for members of the Corporation.2.       The matter is now urgent in that I have to be ready to appoint atleast the minimum seven members by about Easter in order to meet therequirements of the Bill,3.       The nationalised steel industry, with a capital concentration of 1, 600 million and a labour force of nearly 300, 000, will be the largestmanufacturing complex in Britain and one of the largest in the world.In addition it faces serious problems at home and fierce competitionabroad.    Its problems are all the greater in that it will not merelyprovide a holding company to run the 14 companies more efficientlybut will break up the existing structure and reconstitute the industry on entirely new lines.4.       There can be no question but that the consequences of the failureof this exercise would be disastrous in both political and economic terms,5,       In the light of all these factors I am now convinced that theCorporation must be a functional Board with members directly responsible for specific fields of policy, e. g. engineering, marketingand production.     This approach means of course that, certainly withthe initial appointments, the members must be persons of provedexperience and expertise.     This raises a problem in that the higherlevels of salary in manufacturing industry are considerably higherthan those currently paid in the existing public sector.     To give somepractical examples of the problem, with the exception of the two trade unionists (Ron Smith and Sid Karris) mere is not one of the 10 membersof the Organising Committee who does not already earn considerably more than the maximum of the highest salary paid to a member of an existing public Board.6.       For obvious reasons it will be my intention to inviteMichael Milne-Watson of Richard Thomas Sk Baldwins to become a member of the Corporation but he is already receiving a Treasuryapproved salary of  15,000 per annum and it would clearly be absurdto offer him a post on the Corporation controlling 14 nationalised steel companies at something over half that rate.-1-
7. An analysis of the senior Executives in the five largestcompanies to be taken over is as follows:-Salary No, WithinRjmge Range &apos;000Chairman/Chief        15-23ExecutiveManaging Director/ 12-19Deputy ChairmanSenior Executive       10-145 3 have salaries of 20, 000 or more5 2 have salaries of  17,5 00 or more21 6 have salaries of 13,500 or more the size and complexity of these companies is of coursevery small indeed in relation to the Corporation,8,     Much of the management of the steel industry is deplorableand my fear is that despite our obligation to protect existing salarieswe may lose the best men at all levels to private industry if we do not provide a proper avenue of advance.    Not only are we in directcompetition for talent with the engineering industry but the remainingprivate sector of the iron and steel industry, with 260 firms and some100,000 men (excluding Iron and Steel Foundries), is also a factor tobe reckoned with.9.      In short thw^ will be competition for men as well as markets and there is both a private steel sector and related manufacturingsectors to which key management of all levels can go.10.     All this leads me to recommend a salary structure as follows:-Chairman  18,000Deputy Chairman   15 , 000Members  9 - 13,00011.     These salaries are considerably lower than those at present being paid to many top Executives both within the companies to be nationalised and in industry generally and would represent a positivemove against excessively high salaries.    They v/ould provide a realistic structure which would not create problems in relation toincomes policy,12.     For men already in the steel companies to be taken over whoare wanted for the Corporation (like Milne-Watson), the provisionsof the Nationalisation Bill would preserve their contractual rights ifthey remained in their present employment;  and we would have to let them keep their contractual salaries on a personal basis if they accepted appointment to the Corporation,    It might still be necessaryto pay more to attract someone from outside the industry whosequalifications for a particular Corporation appointment were outstanding.Individual cases would be considered on their merits after consultation as necessary with the First Secretary of State and the Chancellor of theExchequer.-2-CON FIDE NTS AL
13.     During the passage of the Bill, Corporation salaries have beendebated twice and the debates have received considerable presscoverage.    On the last occasion (on 23rd January) we had a long debate and there was overwhelming support, including from the Governmentbenches, for the  proposition that the Government have to pay something approaching a market rate.    Two particularly significant speecheswere made by Brian CMalley and James Tinn, who both representsteel constituencies.14.     I am quite convinced that this structure cannot seriously be challenged on grounds of incomes policy:(1)      This is a new scale for a new job at a lower rate than existing scales for smaller jobs in the sameand related industries,(2)     Far from increasing incomes it would with theexception of Ron Smith produce a cut in substantivesalary for virtually everyone including the Chairman.(3)     Far from increasing the salary bill there will be avery sizeable reduction as a result of thedecision to concentrate fourteen separate companiesinto probably four groups.15,     I have discussed this problem with many people includingleading trade unionists within and outside the industry as well as withrepresentatives of left-wing opinion in the House and there is over-whelming opinion in favour of recognising the special factors in thisparticular case,16.     When we decided to go ahead with steel nationalisation it was astep with massive implications for the future of British industry andthe economy.    We will run very serious risks and attract nothing butcritcism if we seek to avoid the logic of the situation.17.     I believe my proposals in paragraphs 10 and 12 are the leastwe can do if we are to achieve a smooth transition to public ownership,safeguard our new and vast investment in^the industry and makenationalisation a success,18,     I have already had a preliminary discussion with the first secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who agree withthe salary structure proposed in paragraph 10 above, and agree that thepayment of higher individual salaries to people from outside the futurepublic sector of the steel industry mentioned in the latter part ofparagraph 12 would, if the need arose, have to be considered strictlyon its mex-its at the appropriate time.19.     I invite my colleagues to agree,R. W. M.Ministry of Power, S. W. 1.27th February, 1967,-3-
