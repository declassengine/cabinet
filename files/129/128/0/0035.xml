; DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 35COPY NO.6621st March, 1967CABINETTHE KENNEDY PvOUNDMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIntroductionThe Kennedy Round is the most ambitious attempt which has ever been made to reduce barriers to world trade.    Some 50 countries are now actively engaged in the negotiations, including the UnitedKingdom and other European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and commonwealth countries, the United States, the European economic community (e.c.), Japan and most developing countries.    SuccessiveBritish Governments have given it strong support since its inceptionmore than four years ago in the belief that such reductions must beof benefit to a country like ours which is so dependent.upon its external trade.     The British Governments support for the Kennedy Round hasbeen confirmed most recently in the Communique issued following theEFTA Ministerial meeting at Stockholm.Timing2.       The Kennedy Round has entered its critical phases.     ThePresident1 s powers under the Trade Expansion Act, 1962, expire atthe end of June and the Americans have made it clear beyond doubtthat they need several weeks before that date to prepare the necessarydocumentation and secure the President1 s signature.    It has been agreedthat the negotiations should be finished by 30th April.     The High LevelSteering Group, on which the Presidents Special Representative,Mr, Roth, represents the United States of America, M. Rey, theEuropean Economic Commission, and Sir Richard Powell, the UnitedKingdom, is to meet from 29th March probably for about a week.     the broad content of the final result may v/ell have emerged by the end ofthis meeting, although a good deal will be left to be done at the end ofit.    It is also agreed that there might have to be a Ministerial meetingaround 20th April, if only to allow the less developed countries to comment on the value to them of the bargain struck between the principalnegotiators and to press for greater concessions on products ofparticular importance to them.3.       Although this provisional timetable may slip a little, it is likely that an agreement ad referendum to governments will have been reached by or a little after the end of April.CONFlDEMETiAL
illIndustrial Tariffs4,       The working hypothesis of the negotiations on industrial tariffsis a 50 per cent cut across the board.     On the basis of this hypothesis,the major participants tabled in 1964 lists of products which, for reasons of over-riding national importance, they felt obliged to exclude from sucha cut.    Our list of exclusions was deliberately kept extremely short.Those tabled by our major partners were longer.    Accordingly on30th November last year we put in a list of further provisional exclusionsdesigned to restore the balance.    The Americans did the same.    Themain participants have now agreed that they will all next month converttheir offers into precise schedules of the reduced duties which they are willing to adopt in the light of the known offers of the others.    It is our intention to withdraw from our earlier offers all those products v/hichwe regard as &quot;sensitive&quot;, i. e. those on which our domestic producersmay be particularly adversely affected by a reduction in their protection,together with a number of products of export interest to our main fellow-participants which we feel justified in withholding.    It is admittedly verydifficult, since there are no accepted rules of the game, to determineprecisely what represents a fair balance for us.    We shall be guidedmainly by the extent to which our offers and those of the other majorparticipants fall short of a linear 50 per cent cut across the board,i. e. by a comparison of the percentage of dutiable imports on which each country is making such a cut.     There are, however, other considerations such as the effect of non-tariff barriers.5.       Since total imports of dutiable industrial goods into the e.c. andthe United States of America alone are in value more than six timesour total dutiable imports, the new opportunities for our exporters asa whole should more than compensate for the degree to v/hich we shallhave to open our market to the exports of others.Sector Groups6.       In certain industrial goods - notably chemicals, steel, motor vehicles and textiles - it is recognised that there must be reciprocityif agreement is to be reached.    Over much of the rest of the field thereis scope for bargaining offers on one product or group of products againstcounter offers on quite a different group.     The situation in the&quot;reciprocity&quot; sectors is briefly as follows:Chemicals(a)    The central problem here is the American Selling Price (AS?)system for bensenoid chemicals, for the abolition of which all the other major participants are pressing;  this would require new legislation by Congress and is not within the Presidents present authority.     the eec are unwilling to make any substantial reductions on chemicalsuntil Congress has legislated on the abolition of ASP.     the americans say that Congress will not look at any proposal forthis unless there has first been some reduction of tariffs abroad in return for such reductions as the Americans can make under their existing powers.     The problem is therefore to devise a packagein two parts - the first independent of, and the second dependent upon,removal of the ASP system.    One of the main tasks of the meeting ofthe High Level Steering Group beginning on 29th March v/ill be to look for ways of cutting this Gordian knot.
Steel(b) The prospects in this sector are not bright.     The european coal and Steel Community (ECSC) raised their steel tariffs in 1964although we had made an arrangement with them in 1957 for mutualreductions in tariffs.     Though the Community are prepared to reduce their steel tariffs roughly to the 1957 level, they will not go below this.We have refused to offer any reduction of our steel tariffs in return forthis, since v/e have already paid once under the 1957 arrangements.It is unlikely that significant tariff reductions will be made in the steelsector.Motor Vehicles(c) The SEC have excluded heavy lorries from their tariff offer.This has been very unwelcome to our industry, and we have been pressing the e.c. to include them.     The industry&apos;s present advice,to which they may not adhere in the last resort, is that we should withdraw our offers in the whole of the motor vehicle sector, bothcars and commercial vehicles, if the e.c. continue to refuse a tariffreduction on heavy lorries.    If we do make such a withdrawal, the eec wdll almost certainly also withdraw motor cars and there willbe no reduction at all in the high duties (generally 22 per cent) which both we and the Community impose on motor vehicles.    A finaldecision on this will need to be made before the end of April if wefail, in spite of our pressure, to get the Community to change theirattitude on heavy lorries.Textiles(d) Our offers in this sector fall v/ell short of those made by the eec and the United States of America, both of whom are prepared tomake tariff reductions on cotton textiles provided the developing countriesagree to the extension of the Long-Term Cotton Arrangement.     TheUnited States of America are excluding little in the textile sector,apart from wool, and the e.c. have made a reasonable offer on mosttextiles.    We cannot offer to reduce our tariffs on cotton or jutetextiles, and we shall have to withdraw our offer on wool in the absenceof reciprocity from the United States of America.    Unless we maintainsignificant offers in other parts of this sector - principally man-madefibre textiles and mixtures - the e.c. and the United States of Americamay try to make this the pretext for withdrawing much of their offer,Non-Tariff Barriers(e) Apart from the ASP system for benzenoid chemicals, the mainnon-tariff barriers of interest to us are American wine gallon assess-ment on imported whisky (which would also need separate legislation by Congress) and American and Canadian anti-dumping practices.We have offered to abolish Commonwealth preference on unmanufacturedtobacco if the Americans abolish the wine gallon assessment system.There have been continuous discussions in Geneva with the main objective of securing some alleviation of oppressive United Statesand Canadian anti-dumping practices.     The United States have comea little way to meet us.    While the Canadians have shown signs ofwillingness to bring their legislation somewhat closer to Article VI
of the General Agreement on Tarriffs and Trade (GATT), it seems matthis would be little more than a gain in appearance without much realmove on the points of substance which have troubled our dealings with canada on this difficult subject.    Discussions are continuing in Geneva,and we are not entirely without hope that a draft international antii-dumping code will be negotiated mat would help our exporters in othermarkets without reducing our present power to protect our domestic producers.The Americans, for their part, have pressed us to take actionon non-tariff barriers of interest to them.    We can do nothing about ourvirtual prohibition on imports of coal or about television films, but thereare one or two minor pieces of action which we can take, e, g, removalof our restrictions on imports of pigmeat and perhaps processed milkfrom the dollar area and removal of import licensing on dollar aircraft.The Americans are very keen that we should relax our (illegal) import restrictions on citrus, which are maintained mainly for the benefit ofthe West Indies, but it seems unlikely that we shall be able to do this at present.Agriculture(f) The Americans have insisted from the outset that the kennedy round as a whole should have a material agricultural content, but theyhave lowered their sights during the negotiations, and there is noquestion of a 50 per cent cut across the board in this field.    We have offered reductions in a number of duties, but the touchstone of successhas come to be the proposed international cereals agreement, on whicha separate paper is being circulated.Commonwealth Preference(g) To the extent that we and other Commonwealth countries reduce our most favoured nation (m0 f, n. ) tariffs, Commonwealth preferencemargins will generally be reduced.     (This must happen whereCommonwealth goods enter duty free, as they usually do in the UnitedKingdom, but it also tends to happen where other commonwealth countries impose preferential rates of duty which they do not want toreduce in step with reductions in the m, f, n. rates),,    We know that canada and Australia have made offers to the United States and Japaninvolving the removal or reduction of our preferences over a very substantial field of trade.     There may be some scope for bargaininghere by offering to withdraw some of our offers involving preferencesin our market of interest to Canada and Australia as a means of inducingthem to do the same for us.    Past experience and the present atmospheredo not lead us to expect more than a very limited success.    While we did not exclude from our offers items on which Commonwealth preferencewas important, we made it clear that we could reduce contractualpreferences only with the consent of the countries which enjoyed them.We hoped that we would get this consent where it was clear that thecountries concerned were adequately compensated by reductions in the tariffs of third countries on products in v/hich they had an export interest.
There is an awkward problem in the field of tropical products.One of the agreed objectives of the Kennedy Round is to reduce barriersto trade on products of interest to developing countries.     We have to reconcile in our offers the interests of Commonwealth developing countries with those of non-Commonwealth developing countries.We are about to consult Commonwealth countries in the hope ofsecuring their acquiescence in our reducing or abolishing preferenceson certain tropical products which do not appear to us to be important in determining the volume or direction of trade, and where othercountries have made offers of sufficient value to compensate theCommonwealth countries concerned for the erosion of their preferencesin the United Kingdom market.D.P.
