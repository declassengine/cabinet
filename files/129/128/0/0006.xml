Of the two courses discussed in the paper, course 1(paragraph 23) has the merit of ensuring a British solution tothe Pye problem, i. e. that Thorn rather than Philips gaincontrol of Pye.    But on balance I recommend course 2(paragraph 25) for the reasons set out in paragraph 26.3.       As regards telecommunications and instrumentation,if Philips give the required undertakings it should be possibleto reorganise the industry in accordance with the governments plans.     If they do not, there would be a defensible case for refusing exchange control.T   t treasury Chambers, S. W,l?11th January, 1967
COMMERCIALPYEMemorandum by officials the Treasury have received application for exchange controlconsent for the acquisition by Philips Electronic Holdings of controlof Pye of Cambridge Limited.    Philips Electronic Holdings is a newUnited Kingdom company, a subsidiary of Philips Industries, also a united Kingdom company but  wholly owned by N0V. Philips ofEindhoven, Netherlands.    Exchange control consent is requiredbecause this transaction would result in the control (50 per cent of voting shares) of a United Kingdom company (Pye) passing(indirectly) to a foreign company.2,       Philips (United Kingdom) already own 5 per cent of Pye,Philips (Eindhoven) have in recent weeks been buying Pye shares in the market.    In this way they have acquired some 19 per cent.So Philips already control 24 per cent of the Pye shares.3.       Thorn Electrical are also bidding for Pye.    Sylvania, a wholly owned United States subsidiary of the United States GeneralTelephone Company, have a 23 per cent shareholding in Thorn, but since this non-resident shareholding is only a minority one, Thorndo not require any exchange control consent in connection with theirbid for Pye,4.       On grounds of industrial policy the Minister of Technologywould prefer Thorn to be successful.    If Thorn and Philips are leftto fight it out by bid and counterbid, Philips will probably win, havingmore money behind them.    The question for Ministers is what shouldbe done about the Philips application for exchange control consent inthese circumstances.Background5,       The Pye business falls into three main activities:  telecommunications-cations (including both &apos;Post Office&apos; equipment, and mobile radio) andinstrumentation both of which are technologically interesting, expandingand profitable;   and radio, television and domestic appliances, whichhave made and are making big losses.    The trading results of thecompany for the year to 31st March, 1966, are shown at Annex A,6.       Pye&apos;s last balance sheet showed bank overdrafts and short-termdebts to a total of  20. 9 million, but these have since been reduced to under  20 million.     The present management of Pye is able to hold theposition, but will be in a serious situation if the uncertainty about thefuture of the company is so prolonged as to bring about a loss ofconfidence among their customers, especially overseas.7,       Pye have had a serious management dispute which resulted inthe departure of Mr, C.O. Stanley, the founder, and his son which wasratified at a shareholders&apos; meeting last November.     Their Chairmanis Mr, Duncan, who has a doctors mandate;  he is 68 and intends to retire when he has put Pye straight and in good hands,
8,       Mr, Duncan had contemplated a division of the firm under whichthe telecommunications side would have gone to a joint company formed by Pye and the United States firm General Telephones the latter being a minority shareholder.    The instrumentation side would have joinedwith Cambridge Instruments and George Kent, and the radio and televisioninterests would have gone to Thorn Electrical.9.       There had also been over some long period discussions on various forms of association between Philips and Pye.     Mr, CO. Stanley hadbeen active in this.The Takeover Battle10.       In November Philips offered 8s. a share for half of the Pyeshareholders&apos; holdings.     Thorn countered with a statement whichimplied an offer, never made, of 10s. 9d, a share (on the then Pyeshare price) for the whole of Pye shareholders1 holdings.     Th&amp;y-aaeabuul Lo offer (and this is known publicly) the equivalent of IS a. a share-,partly in loan capitni-03P-eash, and partly in unsecured convertible- loan&quot;stock, containing an option  or holder3 to convert into the equivalent ofPyo equity.11,        The latest Philips offer, announced but not yet formally put toshareholders, is equivalent to 12s. a share, v/hich values Pye at 30 million.    It would take the form of the offer of two loan stocks in the new company.     There would be a cash alternative to one, andthe other would be saleable on the market, so that a shareholder could get cash if he wished.     One of the stocks would be convertible at various dates between 1970 and 1973 into the equivalent of Pye equity,so that shareholders who wish to get back into Pye equity would be ableto do so.     But Philips would retain control.     The whole of the  30million would be covered from funds brought in from overseas oralready held in this country by Philips and remittable overseas.12,       As a result of their recent meeting with the Minister of technology, Philips are now considering an alternative form ofoffer in which the whole of the consideration would be cash brought in from overseas.     There would again be provision for shareholdersto repurchase later the equivalent of Pye equity, at the offer price of12s.     The Minister has suggested to Philips that if exchange controlconsent were granted, it might be subject to undertakings toco-operate in rationalisation plans which might involve mergingparts of the Pye business in new and larger units.    A cash purchasenow would give Philips more flexibility for later action of this kind,13,       Either version of the offer would meet the normal technicalrequirements of United Kingdom exchange control.     Under paragraph11 the immediate inflow to the official reserves would be about 13 million, under paragraph 12 it would be  30 million.-2-TOP SECRETCOMMERCIAL,COMMERCIAL
Industrial Considerations14.       On industrial policy grounds the Minister of Technology doesnot want to see the Pye telecommunications or instrumentationdivisions become part of a foreign controlled international group.These are both fields for rationalisation within the United Kingdom,The former has just been referred to the 1958-59.15.       Foreign control could also lead to a diminution of exports;and Pye&apos;s export record in telecommunication is a particularly goodone.    And it could lead to the milking of Pye&apos;s technological skills bythe foreign owner.Discussions with the 1958-59 and with the firms16.       Accordingly the Minister has held discussions with theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) and with the firms to explore the likely outcome of the present takeover battle andto guide the decision on exchange control.17.       The 1958-59 would not of course want to see Pye in the handsof a foreign buyer.     They are ready to contemplate assisting thepurchase of the telecommunications and instrumentation interestsof Pye from a successful bidder at a fair valuation and would thusprovide the cash which would be needed by a successful bidder topay off Pye!s debts.18.       Sir Jules Thorn wants the telecommunications and instrumentationside of Pye to diversify his business.      He contemplates the possibilityof securing General Telephones knowhow to develop the telecornmunica-tions side.    But he does not insist on control and would be ready toconsider mergers under the 1958-59 aegis, except for the radio telephoneside which is already of world cla.ss and which he would like to hangon to.    He would expect over a period to phase out the Pye television and radio interests, since his own factories are more modern and efficient.    He said he would be ready if Encouraged1 by the Governmentto bid above Philips expected 12s, offer.    He said that he did not expectmaterial &quot;encouragement&apos; or refusal of exchange control consent toPhilips.    He is likely to make a bid whether encouraged or not,19.       Philips say that their main interest has been to prevent Pyefalling into United States&apos; hands.    Pye buy  3-g- million worth ofcomponents a year from Mullards (a Philips United Kingdom subsidiary).They are also interested in the telecoimmunications and instrumentationsides.     They say they do not aim to have, long-term, a 100 per centholding in Pye, hence the convertible loan stock.     They would leave aPye Board with considerable autonomy, and would not run contrary tothe national interest.20,      The Minister suggested to Philips that if the Government were todecide to give exchange control permission, they might wish to haveformal assurances, covering such matters a.s --3-COMMERCIAL,
inclusion of the Pye telecommunications and instrumentationdivisions in rationalisation schemes;   exchange of Director shipsbetween the Philips and Pye Boards;   safeguards againstdraining of:, technical skills;   safeguards on exports.They said they would be ready to consider giving these,21.       Mr. Duncan of Pye would prefer to see Thorn win.    With one exception his Board are ready to commend a Philips bid of 12s. buthe thinks they would support a Thorn bid if it were as high as a Philipsone.    He waf, confident that a value between 12su and 13s. was fair tothe shareholders.Courses for consideration22.       There are two main courses for consideration.23.       Course 10    Refuse exchange control consent to Philips, so thatThorn win.     Since at present the highest known bid is that of Philips,,tho suggestion is that no action be taken until Thorn make known ahigher bid.    At that point Philips would be informed that exchange control consent v/ould not be forthcoming should they put in a counter-bid.24.        There is a procedural problem here.    Philips are pressing fora reply to their application for exchange control consent, and inparticular for a statement of any conditions which the government might wish to attach to such a consent.    Reasonably enough, they want to know these conditions before they actually put out theirpresent offer.    But the Government cannot explain to them under-takings that they would be required to give as a condition of consent,and later refuse consent if they give the undertakings.25.      Course 2.    Negotiate appropriate undertakings now with Philipsas a condition of exchange control consent.     Then leave Philips andThorn to fight it out, and if Philips win, give exchange control consentsubject to the undertakings negotiated.    Annex 3 is a draft of the undertakings proposed by the Ministry of Technology.26.      Course 1 has the advantage of assuring the success of Thorn.Unfortunately, in addition to the procedural difficulty already mentioned,it would involve considerable difficulties:(i)   The refusal of exchange control consent would be a sharpreversal of established policy, contrary to general inter-national practice, and bound to have an adverse influence oninward investment generally into the United Kingdom.     Thepresent policy, which has been operated continuously and v/asreiterated publicly by the Chancellor of the Exchequer inParliament on 12th July, 1966, is to welcome inward invest-ment, while considering on merits cases involving the take.-over of existing companies which by their size or their natureconstitute a vital part of British industry,-4-
Pye may fall in the latter category, but even so, this would bethe first time that the Government v/ould have refused exchange control consent for an important inward investment proposal.Such a refusal would be a far-reaching reversal of government policy.    It will not go unnoticed that the refusal has been directed against a Dutch company, whereas the Governmenthas allowed similar schemes sponsored by United states companies to go ahead.Nevertheless, the Minister of Technology is of the opinion thatthe case for preferring Thorn to Philips is strong enough tojustify the use of exchange control to prevent Philips fromsucceeding,(ii)   Until now it has always been stressed that the purpose ofexchange control is to protect the balance of payments;indeed it might be open to challenge in the courts if itwere used for a purpose demonstrably different from this.The immediate effect of refusing the Philips offer is to deprive the reserves of a capital inflow of at least 13 million, or  30 million or more if Philips change their offer,(iii) If Philips make public the fact that they would out-bid Thornif they could get exchange control consent, the Governmentwould be put in the embarrassing position of depriving the shareholders of a substantial sum of money, or of pressingThorn to match the higher offer which they may not be willingor able to do,(iv) The embarrassments could be increased if Philips should takeadvantage of the fact that they do not need exchange controlconsent until they buy more than 50 per cent of the Pyeshares.    If they v/ish to fight, they might organise their offer so as to get 49 per cent of the shares, and then argueabout consent for the rest from this position of strength,27.      If Course 2 were adopted and Philips won, it v/ould leave themin control of Pye radio and television.     To this extent another world-famous British firm v/ould have fallen under foreign control, at aboutthe same time as the R.ootes/Chrysler affair,   &apos; On the other hand theGovernment would retain some freedom to pursue rationalisation intelecommunications and instrumentation.     The undertakings could notbe made legally watertight, but if Philips went back on them, it wouldbe justifiable to use the Governments purchasing power to put further pressure on them.     The difficulties in -paragraph 25 would be avoided,28,      If Philips were to decline to give the undertakings, provided thatthe undertakings are evidently reasonable, that would be a much moredefensible reason for refusing exchange control consent than the blankrefusal of Course 1,
