HS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C(67) 16th January, 1967CABINETLIMB-FITTERS:  DEFIANCE OF THE STANDSTILLMemorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic affairs my colleagues will be aware of the difficulty which has arisenover the pay of limb-fitters employed by J.E. Hanger &amp; Co, which ledto a work-to-rule by members of the Association of Supervisory staffs and Technicians (ASSET) employed at all the limb-fitting centres.    the worst delays and hardship to the disabled occurred at Queen Mary]hospital, Roehampton, and at Liverpool and Birmingham.2.       The origins of this difficulty and the course of events sinceApril, 1966, are summarised in the Annex,3.       The firrxi!s offer to pay the increase from 2nd January, 1967,would have been a clear breach of the standstill and the Minister ofLabour proposed that the matter should be referred to the national board for Prices and Incomes with a request to the parties to withholdthe increase pending the Board1 s report,4.       The Minister of Labour recognised that ordinarily consideration would have had to be given to the making of an order under Part IV ofthe Prices and Incomes Act prohibiting payment of the increase, but with the interests of the disabled so deeply involved in the not unlikely event of a resumption of the work-to-rule, he considered that it wouldbe politically difficult to take this course.    The Minister of Health was prepared to accept the reference to the National Board for Prices and incomes, but he was opposed to making an order at least until after theBoardrs report was available when it would still be open to the Governmentto make an order rescinding the se if the report justified such action.50       The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I felt that the course proposedby the Minister ox Labour should be adopted because of the desirability of avoiding the impression that we were using our statutory powers withunimaginative inflexibility, but we considered it essential that theGovernment should stand ready to make a Part IV order in the eventof the parties refusing to withhold payment pending the Board1 s report.The Ministers of Labour and of Health reserved their position over themaking of an order even in these circumstances.69COPY NO,
6.       Unfortunately, J. S, Hanger &amp; Co, have informed the Ministry ofL.abour of their intention to make the  100 payment to their limb-fittersas from 2nd January, 1967a     This means that the employers are in clearbreach of the requirements of the standstill because payment of theincrease should be deferred until after 30th June, 1967, unless it couldbe justified against the criteria for severe restraint (Cmnd0 3150)on either the employer nor the union have argued that it could be sojustified and the agreement does not appear to satisfy any of thesecriteria.si7,       The number of men involved is quite small;   J,E, Hanger employ100 out of e. total of 210 limb-fitter s0    But it is very difficult to regard this breach of the standstill as &quot;insignificant&quot; because the matter has attracted widespread publicity and the newspapers are pressing for astatement of the Governments intentions in the face of this &quot;defiance&quot;of the standstill.    We have felt compelled to make Part IV orders in other cases involving directly similarly small numbers of employees becauseof the strong likelihood of undermining the voluntary support of the greatmajority of employers and unions if &quot;the selfish few&quot; seem able to floutthe Governments policy with impunity.8,       We justified the enactment of Part IV with its exceptionally wide powers on the grounds that it was necessary to have power to deal withthe selfish few.    Our decision over the use of Part IV in the present case v/ill be seen as a test of the Governments resolution in seeking tomaintain the standstill.9.       I recognise that in the event of ASSET instructing the limb-fittersto work to rule again, there may well be criticism of the Government onthe grounds that v/e are ignoring the interests of the disabled who will suffer through the delays.    ASSET have taken a militant line throughoutthe standstill and one cannot rely on the union to defer a resumption ofthe work-to-rule at least until the National Board for Prices and Incomeshas reported, although some union members last year apparently quietlyignored the work &quot;to-rule.     But a decision not to use our powers willalso attract considerable criticism particularly as the Government had asked the parties to withhold payment pending the Board&apos;s report andhas been rebuffed,10.       We have come through the first six months of the standstill with considerable success thanks to the readiness of most employers and unions to abide by its requirements and, I believe, to the Government1 sown firmness in dealing with threatened breaches of the standstill,V/e are now entering the more testing period of severe restraint whenmany workers will be paid under the rules relating to existing commit-ments while many others will have to wait until after 30th June, 1967.It will be more difficult to persuade these workers to be patient if they see some people &quot;getting away with it&quot; in a flagrant manner,11.        The Confederation of British Industry have raised no objectionto the exercise of Part IV powers.     The Trades Union Congress (TUC)did not wish the matter to be referred to the National Board on thegrounds that this was a misuse of the Board, and that the Governmentshould be able to settle this matter by themselves.     The TUC felt also
Mo S,Department of Economic Affairs, S.Nf.l,6th January, 1967that Part IV was a somewhat heavy instrument to use but they did not raise objection to an order,120       I invite my colleagues, therefore, to agree to the making of anorder under Section 29 of the Prices and Incomes Act to prohibitJ. E. Kanger St Co. from continuing to pay the increase from thedate of the order,
ANNEXPAY INCREASE FOR LIMB-FITTERS EMPLOYED BYJ.E. HANGER AND COMPANYThere are nine manufacturers of artificial limbs under contract to the Ministry of Health, employing limb-fitters at ceatres throughoutthe country.      J.E. Hanger and Co. employ 100 out of a total of 210limb-fitters, and by tradition take the lead in negotiations.    The currentpay-scale is  1,187- 1, 350 a year.2.       In April, 1966 the Association of Supervisory Staffs andTechnicians (ASSET) presented a claim to Hangers that the duties oflimb-fitters should be revalued and salaries brought into line with thoseof comparable technicians,    Both sides agreed to consider arbitration and in June the firm offered to negotiate a 5 per cent cost-of-livingincrease and further increases based on ASSET&apos;s acceptance of proposalsfor increased efficiency.    On 9th August ASSET claimed  100 a year asan interim increase back-dated to 1st May, 1966, in return for setting upa joint committee of the company and the limb-fitters-to improve efficiency and productivity.    The company agreed in principle to the setting up of a joint committee and to an increase, but said that in viewof che prices and incomes policy it would not be possible to implement the increase as from 1st May;  the date was more likely to be 1st January,1967 or some other time permitted by Government policy.3.       Following the company&apos;s refusal to implement and back-date theincrease ASSET members imposed a work-to-rule in all limb-fittingcentres from 5th September.    This created long delays and hardship,particularly at Queen Mary&apos;s Hospital, Roehampton, and at liverpool and Birmingham, though some union members apparently quietly ignoredthe work-to-rule.4.       Approaches were made to Mr. Clive Jenkins, General Secretaryof ASSET, to call off the work-to-rule, pointing out that it was causinghardship to the disabled,    He said that he would call it off if the increasewere conceded from November, while reserving the legal rights of hismembers with regard to the period from 1st May.    A joint discussionunder Ministry of Labour chairmanship in November produced nosoftening on the union&apos;s side, but it was obvious that the company was willing to pay the increase at the earliest date permitted by theGovernment.5.       Subsequently the firm itself offered to pay the increase from2nd January and to hold further discussions on methods of improvingefficiency, with a possible later pay increase of  30- 60.    This offer was accepted by ASSET on 2nd December, and the work-to-rule was called off from 5th December.
