HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C(67) 3822nd March. 1967COPY NO.418-CABINETTHE KENNEDY ROUND;  CEREALSMemorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretaryof State for Economic AffairsThe issues involved in the cereals negotiations are set out in thememorandum by the Minister of Agriculture (C(67) 36).    These were considered by the Sub-Committee on External Economic Policy of the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy at its meeting on 21st March,and I set out the Sub-Committee^ conclusions below.2.      A cereals agreement is bound to involve a net additional foreign exchange cost to the United Kingdom.    We should therefore onlysubscribe to it if we can secure compensating advantages in the rest ofthe Kennedy Round negotiations - either on industrial tariffs or on non-tariff barriers.    On industrial tariffs it seems unlikely that weshall get more than we give.    We must therefore look especially toconcessions from the United States on non-tariff barriers, particularly on American Selling Price (ASP) and wine gallon assessment, and theSub-Committee agreed that we should send a further instruction to our delegation that they should make it abundantly clear t o the americans that we shall not be prepared to sign a cereals agreement unless theycan offer substantial concessions on non-tariff barriers.3.       There is, however, a difficulty here in that the abolition of ASPand wine gallon assessment each require Congressional legislation.Since therefore American concessions on these issues must be conditional on the passage of such legislation, it seems necessary that a comparableweight of concessions on&apos;our side should be similarly conditional.    ThePresident of the Board of Trade undertook to consider further how weshould ensure this, and in particular whether it would be right to insist that a cereals agreement should be made conditional in this way.4.      Subject to these general points, the Sub-Committee agreed thatour delegation should be authorised -(a) to explore what are the best terms we could secure on price and access with and without readiness on our part to accept a food-aid programme at a cost to us not exceeding  5 million a year;and-1-
(b)    to indicate in their exploratory talks that we might be preparedto contemplate a self-supply ratio somewhat below 72 per cent:the delegation should be told that Ministers would find it extremely difficult to accept a ratio below 70 per cent, butthey should not at this stage be tied specifically to 70 per centas the absolute minimum.The delegation should report the results of their exploratoi-y discussions to Ministers, who would then decide final negotiating instructions oncereals, taking account of progress in the other sectors of thenegotiations.5.       I invite my colleagues to endorse the Sub-Committee^conclusions in paragraphs 2 and 4 above.M. 5.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.T.22nd March, 1967-2-
