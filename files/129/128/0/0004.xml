STATISTICS OF IMPORTED MACHINERYMemorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic AffairsWe have to decide whether to give to the Economic development committees for the Mechanical Engineering and Machine Tool Industriesinformation about imports of machinery which they consider essential ifthey are to achieve any success in their attempts to pursue the policy of import saving to which the Government have urged them.    This was discussed last week in the Ministerial Committee on economic development and the case for and against is given in ED(67) 1 and 2:the former memorandum describes a compromise proposal which theEconomic Development Committees (EDC) regard as inadequate.2,       Broadly, it emerged from last week&apos;s discussion that theFinancial Secretary and the President of the Board of Trade considerthat the release of the information sought by the Committees, collectedas it is under statute by Her Majesty&apos;s Customs and Excise for revenuepurposes, would represent a breach of the principle of confidentialitywhich would be damaging to the efficient operation of Her MajestylsCustoms and Excise and to the Governments collection of statisticsfrom industry.    They believe that the compromise proposal shouldbe given a trial.    On the other hand, the Minister of Technology andI consider that the importance of the EDCs&apos; work on import substitutionoutweighs these disadvantages and that they should be given theinformation they need.     This argument has, however, been overtakenby the Attorney-General&apos;s advice that Her Majesty&apos;? Customs and excise would be ultra vires in supplying the EDCs with the information required from documents furnished by traders under the Customs and excise Act;  and that legislation would be necessary before this couldbe done,3,       It was suggested that we might explore the possibility of securingthe necessary information from Governmental sources other than the documents obtained by Customs under statute for revenue purposes.At my request the President of the Board of Trade has since examinedthis in relation to the information collected from industry by his department and his memorandum (C(67) 5) indicates that there is no solution to be found in that direction,4.       It thus appears that our only recourse, if we are to give theEDCs the information they want, is to take the necessary powers by legislation.    I should like to consider with my colleagues how we should now proceed and what I should tell the Chairmen of the two EngineeringEDCs who are anxious for an answer.M.S.Department of Economic Affairs, S.Y.r,l,10th January, 1967x CONFfBEMTIAfeCONFIDENTIALIIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT)C(67) 4 COPY NO.   6911th January, 1967CABINET
