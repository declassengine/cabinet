C(67) 30 COPY NO.14th March, 1967CABINETTHE AIRBUSMemorandum by the Minister of TechnologyWhen the Ministerial Committee on Science and Technologyconsidered the Airbus project on 24th February, 1967 they instructed theOfficial Committee on Science and Technology to give further considerationto the proposals for an Airbus in the light of British European Airways1(BEA) interim re-equipment programme.    The further report from theOfficial Committee is attached as Annexes A and B to this paper.2,      The European airbus is the first major civil aircraft project tobe considered by the Government since October, 1964.    The case for itis based on the following considerations:(a) The British aircraft industry needs to integrate with Europe, and build on a European home market, in order to survive.    TheEuropean aircraft industry itself cannot survive unless it keepsa stake in the subsonic medium-range passenger aircraftbusiness.    American dominance in big jets has become sopowerful that a really determined effort has got to be made bythe Europeans if all the air fleets in the world are not to goAmerican and stay American.(b) The airbus is the best basis for challenging Americandomination.    It is too late to challenge them with a long-rangesubsonic jet;  at smaller sizes than the airbus we are alreadyconfronted by an aircraft (the Boeing 727-200) whose operatingeconomics we could not beat with the technical knowledge now available.(c) The airbus offers a great deal of work for the design staffs and production teams of the British aircraft industry, and without it, this industry would face a drastic reduction in size.    the likelihood is that many of the skilled people thus lost wouldemigrate to America and strengthen the American aircraft industry still further in relation to our own.    Even if theavailable resources could be redeployed in the United Kingdom,the export content of their output could not be expected to be higher than the average for the engineering industries generally -25 per cent - as against 65 per cent for the civil aircraft industry.-1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
(d) This issue is therefore primarily a political one which Europehas somehow to be able to solve and which must be connectedvery closely with the future thinking of Europe oncollaboration, especially in advanced technology.    We mayhave to pay over the odds to solve it, as Plowden implied,France and Germany appear ready to accept this.    This makes the European airbus a test case for us.(e) We have a vital British interest here which must condition our attitude.    That is to install a Rolls Royce engine in the airbus.Rolls/Bristol are now an aero-engine company of world size and potential.    They need this engine to keep ahead and anorder for a European airbus would enable it to be developed and would provide the ba.se from which it could find further orders abroad.    The fact that it was being installed in theEuropean airbus would probably help to get it into the projectedLochheed airbus with an extra market.Here we have a different interest from the French who havehitherto preferred the Pratt and Whitney JT9D engine.    Thereare signs now that a determined political stand in the interestsof European technology would persuade them to accept the rolls Royce engine,3.       The considerations given above should condition our attitudetowards the airbus.    If they did not exist, we should look upon theoperation as a purely commercial one and, on the basis of such estimates as we have, we would not go ahead.    It is no use pretendingthat this is primarily a commercial case.    But even having established that there are wider political, industrial and economic objectives, it isimportant to cost with extreme care the price that we are likely to beasked to pay for pur suing them.    That wider considerations arepredominant does not preclude us from the most rigorous cost analysis,even though that analysis by itself may not be decisive.4.      Present estimates show that for Her MajestyTs Government tobreak even on the project would involve selling some 300 airbuses -perhaps 250-275 if escalation can be contained. &apos; Orders from thenational airlines of the participating countries are unlikely to exceedabout 100 and all orders in Europe about 150.    To count on sales ofmore than 200 aircraft in the world as a whole may well be unrealistic.But the Department of Economic Affairs in a submission to the official committee, using figures which have not been discounted, has shownthat to sell only 85 European airbuses involves, on the worstassumptions, a preference rate no higher than the generally acceptedfigure of 15 per cent, while no preference at all is involved when 130airbuses are sold.5. On tho-oamo -baoio but booking at it another way, if the probableloss to Her Majesty&apos;s Government on sales of 200 aircraft is comparedwith the foreign exchange benefits which would accrue, the hypotheticalexport subsidy involved is under 10 per cent.-2-
6.      The consequences for BEA must also be taken into account.    Onany assumption it seems that they require a minimum fleet of about20 airbuses;  the question is whether or not the case for the Europeanairbus is undermined even if BEA should make only this minumumpurchase.    A minumum BEA order of 20 would reduce the initialexpected commitment from the three national airlines to 75.    Such abase is still substantial - greater than that enjoyed by any previousaircraft launched with United Kingdom launching aid.    The decision onthe airbus does not, therefore, need to await resolution of BEA&apos;sintermediate aircraft problem.7.      I recommend to my colleagues that the United Kingdom shouldnot proceed to the project definition stage unless it is clearly understoodwith our partners that eventual production could only be contemplated ifthe five following prerequisites were met -(i) If there is an assured market for 75 airbuses in the threenational airlines, and if as a result of further market researchthere is a reasonable expectation of at least 50 sales to otherairlines,(ii) If the launching costs do not exceed the present estimate of 130 million and are re-examined at an early stage to see whether a significant reduction can be obtained.(iii) If the Rolls Royce engine is adopted.(iv) If there is assurance that the target operating costs of30 per cent below current types, and the in-service date of1972-73, will be achieved.(v) If the manufacturers will take a proper financial participation,i. e. normal production costs and, say, some 20 per cent ofdevelopment costs.8.      I ask my colleagues to agree that if these conditions are acceptable we should proceed to the project definition stage.A.W.B.Ministry of Technology, S.W.1.13th March, 1967-3-
ANNEX ATHE EUROPEAN AIRBUSSummary of a Report by,the Official Committee on Science and technology.    It has been forecast that there will be a world market for 700-800 air-buses by 1980, of which about 300 will be for use outside the United States.The airbus to be built by United States industry is likely to have a capacityof 300-350 seats, but an airbus for use in Europe and other parts of theworld should have a seating capacity of about 250, as well aB a somewhatshorter range than the American machine.2.    Proposals have been put forward for the development of a 250-seatairbus by a consortium of British, French and German firms.     The objective is an aircraft with operating costs 30 per cent below those of- current types,available for sale to the airlines by 1973 at a unit cost of  3.25 million.The launching costs are estimated at  130 million and 300 airbuses wouldhave to be sold if these costs were to be recovered:   this prospect appearsto us to be remote.3.    The airbus could have a British (Rolls-Royce RB 207) or an American(Pratt and Whitney JT9D) engine.     The choice of a Rolls-Royce enginevrould entail additional launching costs of  55 million, but this would be recovered on sales of 160 airbuses.     We believe the adoption of the Rolls-Royce engine is essential both to preserve the European character of the project and to sustain British engine technology.4. The total cost to the three Governments of launching the airbus,including the Rolls-Royce engine, vrould be  185 million, of which theUnited Kingdom Government share would be about  75 million.5.    We regard an initial assured market for 75 airbuses in the nationalairlines of the three participating countries as a prerequisite to any decision to proceed to production.     In addition, we should wish to be assured of the good prospect of at least 50 sales to other airlines as aresult of further market research.     It should be noted, however, that neither we nor probably our collaborators will be able to make a firm commitment   about purchases by national airlines as soon as the endof March.6.     It is essential that the manufacturers should take a proper financialparticipation in the project, bearing the normal production costs and, say,some 20 per cent of development costs.     We understand they are likely toagree to some such condition.
7,     If the European airbus is not built, British European Airways (BEA)is likely to wish to buy some United States equivalent although notnecessarily in the same number or over the same time-scale.     This point mustbe borne in mind in considering the financial implications of total sales offewer than 300 European airbuses.     A review of the foreign exchange earnings and the import-saving aspect indicates that the implied preference would bein the range +5/+15 per cent if the total sales of the aircraft werebetween 105 and 85.8.    The expected losses to Her Majesty&apos;s Government alone on the variouslevels of sales considered in the main paper are -Sales 85      100      &quot;50      200Losses (  million)   59        55        34-        129.    BEA will almost certainly need to acquire, before the airbus comes into service, an aircraft of intermediate size.     The precise nature,implication, and size of this purchase cannot be settled now.10.   The political consequences of a British refusal to   proceed with the airbus project to the product definition stage would be unfortunate.     Itwould give ammunition to those who wished to see the United Kingdom excludedfrom the Common Market, especially in view of our avowed intention to useBritish partnership&apos; in European technology as an argument in support ofour case should we decide to apply for entry,11.   The Treasury have reserved their position on the grounds that the chanceof an economic return on the project is negligible and a substantial lossseems likely.     Furthermore it will involve an increase in the planned levelof the basic public expenditure programmes over the next few years.12.   The Board of Trade have reserved their position on the grounds that adecision is being taken before one, more important to BEA, about an earlieraircraft of intermediate size and will have the result of prejudicing any decision on the latter.13.   Should it not proceed, the United States will have a monopoly positionin the large subsonic aircraft field, with all that this would entail for theEuropean aircraft industry and the side effects for associated advancedtechno logical industries.
1^.   The case for the airbus is presented in greater detail in the report which follows.     Granted that we can obtain satisfactory assurances from our partners on the five prerequisites (on an assured market in thenational airlines and the expectation of further sales;    on control andre-examination of launching costs;    on the adoption of a Rolls-Royce engine;on operating costs and in-service date;    and on participation by thenanufacturers), the Committee (the Treasury and Board of Trade reservingtheir position) recommend that we should enter into an agreement toproceed with the project definition stage.     If the prerequisiteconditions are fulfilled, this would in practice involve a commitment on our part to proceed to completion.-3-
THE EUROPEAN AIRBUSReport by the Official Committee on Science and TechnologyIntroduction1f    following their submission to Ministers on 24th February 1$67(ST(67) 2nd Meeting Minutes, Item 1), the Official Committee on science and Technology were instructed to review their recommendations on the airbusin the light of the interim re-equipment needs of British European Airways(BEA), further consideration of the import-saving aspect of the proposals and the potential of the airbus for use in transporting troops.2,    The Committee believe the airbus project constitutes a watershed inthe history of the European aircraft industry.     Should no Europeancountry now develop a large subsonic aircraft capable of commanding anadequate market, the United States will gain a monopoly position with serious results not only for the European aircraft industry itself butalso perhaps for associated advanced technological industries, such aselectronics and engines, and may also lead to irreversible losses of qualified and highly-skilled manpower.     Only a joint project will havethe assurance of a large enough tied market, and it Is considered that only the projected airbus will command European support as a joint venture.Our prospective partners would be able to make political capital out ofany move on our part to kill the proposal, especially in view of ouravowed intention to use British partnership in European technology as animportant means of support for our case should vie decide to seek member-ship of the e.c..The Airbus Requirement3.    The best prediction of traffic growth that can now be made, combinedrath forecasts of the likely capacity of airports and the air traffic control system, indicates that there will be a market after 1972-73 for short-haul aircraft with a capacity of roughly 250-300 seats and withseat-oile operating costs about 30 per cent below the lowest of presenttypes.     Discussions with Prance and Germany during the last year or morehave reached the conclusion that this is about the right size of aircraft to go for.     An aircraft of 200 seats or less v/ould encounter severecompetition from American aircraft already coming into service;    to produce a competitive aircraft of this size would require a big and unpredictabletechnological advance, for which some two years preliminary research wouldhe needed.The market for airbuses should be as large as 700-800 by 1980, of which some 400-500 would be -for use by United States airlines on internal services.The Lockheed Corporation in the United States is known to be keenlyinterested in developing such an aircraft and is engaged on a project study,tae results of which are likely to be known in about five months and which!s expected to show a preference in the United States domestic market forCONFIDES
an aircraft with a capacity of 300-350 seats.     The aircraft may have twoor, less prohahly, three engines;    for a twin-engined version there are twocompeting engines - the Pratt and IThitney JT9D (41,000 lbs. thrust withdevelopment to 44,000 lbs.) and the Rolls-Royce RB207, (47,500 lbs. thrust),for the development of which Rolls-Royce have submitted proposals toLockheed.     Any Lockheed airbus would probably he in service about oneyear before any European competitor.     The economic demand for an aircraft of 300-350 seats is likely to be very limited in Europe until the late1970s,  hut if there is no alternative European aircraft, some Europeanairlines will buy it and BEA may then he compelled also to purchase some in order to remain competitive.Market Prospects5,    A survey of the probable requirements of BEA, Air Prance andLufthansa in the mid-1970s indicates that the optimum size of airbus for european conditions would he somewhat smaller than that required for manyroutes in the United States, and we have concluded that a seating capacityof about 250 is a realistic target.     G-ranted that development could begin in the near future, and that an Anglo-Prench-German aircraft would be available for sale to the airlines by 1973 at a unit cost of  3.25 million,such an aircraft should he competitive with any United States rival in operating costs and might he somewhat better in airfield performance andnoise.     The development and tooling costs of such a European airbus,including adaptation of an available engine, are provisionally estimated at 130 million (these costs would he increased if a Rolls-Royce engine were used, see paragraph 9);    and 300 aircraft plus spares vrould need to hesold if these launching costs were to he amortised while the selling pricewas held at  3.25 million in order to compete effectively with any potentialUnited States rival.6.     If these launching costs were to he recovered, the European airbusv/ould therefore have to corner the equivalent of the entire world market(300) outside the United States.     Even within Europe itself it is far from certain that all the major airlines would he willing to purchase a european airbus.     But if there were an assurance at the outset that theaircraft would he bought by BEA, Air Prance and Lufthansa this would givea useful basis of orders, building up to perhaps 90-100 aircraft.Outside Europe many potential users of an airbus are in areas whereUnited States influence is strong.     Even though the smaller Europeanairbus might appear better suited to their needs, there can be littleconfidence that all the interested airlines outside the United states would purchase the European product, and we should therefore have to aimalso at some sales within the United States.-5-
7,    It is recognised that the national airlines at present see a market for only about 120 airbuses in Europe as a whole by i98o.     This, however,is believed to be a conservative estimate.     If airlines agreed to realignfares on the denser routes so as to reflect more clearly the lower operating costs of the airbus, it seems possible that sufficient additional trafficmaybe stimulated to create a demand for up to 200 in Europe by 1980,with up to perhaps a further 100 in non-European markets.     This estimatetakes into account that, on present plans, any airbus being designed inthe Unuted States is primarily for their home market (300 seats and2,000-miles range), and would thus be less attractive to European operators,tfho are now discussing an airbus of about 250 beats with a range of about1,200 miles.     It is possible that an airbus comparable to that which weare considering may be produced by some other aircraft firms in the UnitedStates, but it appears unlikely that this would be cheaper or have an earlier in-service date.8.    The Ministry of Defence have examined the possibility of making use ofthe airbus on the assumption that it willb e available some time after 1973.The military air transport forces currently comprise three elements:strategic;    medium-range tactical;    and short-range tactical.     Short-rangetactical requires a comparatively small aircraft, which will probably takethe form of helicopters in the future, and is not relevant to the airbus.For the medium-range tactical role the delivery of 66 C130s has now begunand these aircraft should last until about 1980.     The long-range strategicforce consists of Britannias, Comets, Belfasts and vc10s.     Elements ofthis force will need re-equipping from the mid-1970s, but the nature ofthe aircraft will depend on decisions on our overseas deployments and commitments.     All the indications are that an aircraft of greater range and payload than the airbus would be needed to permit for example the round-the-Cape route, not to mention such other essential military featuresas rear doors, short airfield performance, airdrop capability, which arenot part of the airbus concept.     The Ministry of Defence therefore consider that there is no basis whatever at present for assuming thatthere might be a military case for the airbus and consequently for injectingsuch an element into the assessment of demand.jlJ-iMgJ-cis-l Implications of Development9.    The development and tooling cost of  130 million, (of which the UnitedKingdom would probably bear 37i per cent or  50 million) includes the adaptation of an American engine (the Pratt and Whitney JT9D).     Thedevelopment of a Rolls-Royce engine instead would cost a further  55 million,which would be recovered if sales reached 160 aircraft and to which theFrench and Germans might together be willing to contribute 25 per cent.
Taking account of the share to he borne by Rolls-Royce, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos; s liability might be somewhat less than  30 million, falling to  15 million if the engine vrore also being developed for an Americanapplication.     We regard the adoption of the Rolls-Royce engine asinportant both to preserve the European character of the project and tosupport our own engine technology.10.   Some members of the Committee, taking into account the much lowertotal figures for the development costs of other aircraft of comparablecomplexity, feel some uneasiness about the figure of  130 million whichthey feel may be too high.     If it is, Its acceptance would encouragewasteful procedures.     Other members nevertheless believe, on the basisof earlier experience, that such an estimate is more likely to be increased.In establishing the preconditions for further commitment, it will benecessary, therefore, to pin down our partners to a figure for total launch-ing costs which Is in no way inflated.     If a decision to proceed to the project definition stage is taken, it is thus essential that during that stage the development costs should be carefully scrutinised with a view toobtainining a sizeable reduction.     The eventual figure would have to beconsidered in the light of the commitment obtained from national airlinesand of any other conditions (e.g. United States competition) which mighthave changed by the time the project definition stage was completed.11.   It is considered essential that, as one of the prerequisites tocommitment, the airfr-ane companies should confirm their willingness tobear, say, some 20 per cent of the development costs, leaving government liability of some  100 million.     But, in addition, Governments vrouldprobably have to help with education costs, adding say  30 million, to giveagain a total of  130 million.     We also expect to get industry to bearnormal production costs, given assured orders from the three nationalairlines.     Airframe and engine together might therefore cost Governmentssome  185 million (United Kingdom share around  75 million).     In the very unlikely event of a total technical disaster occurring just before certi-fication, the total at risk for Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be up to 100 million.     It must be stressed that support for the airbus projectvrould involve increases in the planned level of public expenditure onbasic programmes over the next few years.-7-CON FIDE NTS AL
CONFIDE IMTIIALrTnvernment Loss on Sales12.   On all the levels of sales considered in this report, that is 200 and below, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would fail to recover its proportion ofthe estimated launching costs ( 130 million) of the project.     the expected losses to Her Majesty&apos;s Government alone on the various levels of sales considered are -Sales 85       100      105       150 200Losses (  million)   59        55        53        33.5        12Balance of Payments Implications13.   The balance of payments implications for the United Kingdom ofmanufacture of a European airbus compared with purchase by BEA of anapproximately equivalent United States aircraft are examined in Annex 1,In assessing the worth of these figures the following points should heborne in mind:    (a) it cannot be assumed at this stage that BEA would need, or he allowed, to buy an approximately equivalent number of UnitedStates airbuses, hut this assumption is the only one that we have beenable to make for the purpose of calculating and illustrating balance ofpayments implications;    (b)   the calculations shown in Annex 1 are inany   ca.se based on a large number of variables;    and (c) tha.t thesefigures, and indeed those used throughout this paper, including Annex 2,are not discounted.     It has not been possible in the time available to calculate the balance of payments implications of any BEA interimrequirements which may he met either by manufacture of a United Kingdomaircraft or by purchase in the USA.     There are two aspects to thebalance of payments implications of the airbus;    import saving andforeign exchange earning.     Annex 1 shows both the import-saving andforeign exchange earning for the United Kingdom of various levels of saleof a European airbus on two different hypotheses about the BEA requirement -that BEA take 20 or 40 aircraft respectively.     The data employed inconstructing these tables is set out in Appendix A to Annex 1.Ik.   Except in the case of sales of only 50 aircraft (preference up to50 per cent), these calculations show that, in a comparison of a Europeanairbus with United Kingdom engines and a United States airbus with UnitedStates engines, it is not necessary to ascribe a high preference in orderto equate United Kingdom outlay with foreign exchange saved and earned.Thus, for instance, if 20 airbuses are needed by BEA and only 85 aircraftsold altogether, a preference of 15 per cent must he inferred;    if40 airbuses are needed and 105 sold, the implied preference is 6 per cent.If the comparison Is with a United States airbus with United Kingdomengines, however, the implied preference is much lower:   nil where BEAneed 20 and 100 are sold, and 5 per cent where sales total 105 and BEAneed IfC.     (This is because the resources to produce the United Kingdomengine are required in both cases;    the cost is therefore unavoidable.The relevant outlay Is therefore the cost of the airframe plus the cost of producing all engines additional to those required for BEA&apos;s 20 or 40 aircraft).-8-CONFIDENTIAL
15,   The foreign exchange earnings are entirely dependent on the level of export sales achieved.     Taking the case of sales of 100 aircraft (with a&quot;platform&quot; of 85), export earnings would he about  135 million on anoutlay of  260 million, an export content of 50 per cent.     Sales of 150aircraft (with a &quot;platform&quot; of 105) would produce exports of  150 millionnn an outlay of  335 million, an export content of 45 per cent.Igplications of BSA&apos;s Interim Re-equipment Programme16.   BEA envisage using an airbus, whatever other aircraft are also required,but their immediate interest Is in their need for an aircraft of intermediatesize which would bridge the gap between those currently in service or orderedand the airbus.     This need could be met in many different ways, and thenumber of airbuses they would require up to 1980, which may range from 20 to45, is closely related to the nature of their interim re-equipment programme.We are not here concerned with a decision on BEA&apos;s interim aircraft require-ments, but only with the implications which the various options may have forthe overall cost to the Exchequer of the airbus project, and for its economic prospects.17.   A number of possible courses, with a very broad indication of their financial implications, is set out in tabular form in Annex 2.     The bottomline of the table in the Annex shows the likely net effect on BEA and thepublic sector combined.     These figures, which are not discounted, are subjectto considerable margin of uncertainty and the estimates for Courses 5 and 6,made by officials, show almost certainly too favourable an outturn.18.   It will be seen that, at one extreme, a purchase of 45 airbuses and15 Boeing 727/200s (course 4) would ha ve a favourable net effect, derivedfrom a BEA surplus of  48 million partly offset by a G-overnment loss on the airbus of  33 million.     But it involves dollar expenditure of about 50 million.     At the other extreme, a purchase of 45 airbuses coupled witha refusal to allow BEA to buy any interim aircraft (course 3) v/ould have a highly unfavourable net effect of some  95 million.     Compared withCourse 4 it would Involve a subsidy to BEA In one form or another of 110 million.-9-
19.   The general conclusions which we draw from this analysis are:(a) BEA will almost certainly need to acquire, before the airbuscomes into service, an aircraft of intermediate size.   The precisenature   and   size of this purchase cannot be   settled now.(b) It would be wrong at this stage to count on a BEA purchaseof more than 20 airbuses, and for the purpose of the forthcominginternational discussions we (and probably our collaborators also)will not be able to commit airlines finally on specific figures.The important point is to make it clear that a commitment to specifictotal purchases of airbuses by the national airlines will be a pre-requisite to going forward to the production stage.     In pursuingthe matter after the Ministerial meeting we should have on the onehand to enter into negotiations with BEA on their commitment topurchase the airbus, in the course of which the Government wouldbe under heavy pressure to guarantee to make good to BEA any dis-economies they alleged they would incur through buying the airbus,and, on the other hand, if BEA are to purchase only 20, it may bemore difficult to get commitments by the other two national airlinesto make up the balance of the required figure of 75;(c) It would be prudent to envisage the possibility that the cost of the airbus project to the public sector will be increased by a furthercharge in the shape of support for BEA, though we cannot be certainthat the combined cost will be higher than that of other courses.     Norat this stage is it possible to say whether such further support willin fact turn out to be necessary, and its effect cannot be quantified now.Collaboration and Industrial Implications20. The British, French and German firms concerned are technicallycompetent and equipped to produce an airbus. It Is a particularlysuitable choice for a joint project for the following reasons -(a) outside the engine (which should be safe in Rolls Royce hands)the aircraft embodies no advanced technology, so that the risks of technica.1 failure are very small;(b) the airbus taps a new market in which we have the opportunityto compete with the Americans on equal terms  (we can no longerdo so In long-range jets) and avoid near total Americandomination of large passenger and freight aircraft in the 1970s;(c) only as a joint project will the airbus command a big enoughma-market to compete.-10-
21.   The airbus represents an opportunity which may never recur for collaboration in this field.     It will help, if successful, to generatethe habit in European airlines of buying European aircraft, thus creating a home market of the size essential for any continuing challenge to an american monopoly.     It would not be easy to find another project byBeans of which we could retain our foothold in large subsonic aircraftdevelopment during the next decade.     The design team at Hawker SiddeleyAviation would run down^ and the British Aircraft Corporation would beleft in a dominant position, with unpredictable consequences for anairframe company merger on the lines now conceived.Political Impllcatipn.s22.   We were not able to assess fully the political consequences of aBritish refusal to proceed with the airbus project;   but clearly such a unilateral decision on a major collaborative project like the airbus   woulddetract from the argument that the entry of the United Kingdom into the eec would bring great technological benefit to the Community.     V/hile itvrould hardly be decisive itself (should we decide that we wish to enter the e.c.), it would certainly give ammunition to those who wished to seethe United Kingdom excluded from the Common Market.23.   If we do not now decline to proceed, we must recognise that it willhe difficult to ovoid a full commitment to proceed with the project.Deferring a. decision for further studies and discussion would put back the timescale, would probably involve forfeiting some of the market tothe United States, and might lead to the break-up of design teams of theright size.     If we wish to go ahead at all, the next step would thereforehe to enter on the &quot;project definition stage&quot; (project study).     This would represent the first 9 to 12 months of development work, carried throughat the rate necessary to preserve the in-service date.     It would includeinitial design and experimental work, and vrould yield a full aircraftspecification (in consultation with airlines), more reliable estimates ofdevelopment and production costs and a full plan for industrial collaboration.The United Kingdom share of the cost of such a study would be  2 million.Assuming that the engine work was not in any case going ahead for an american airbus, there vrould in parallel be expenditure on the engine,about  3 million of which would fall to the United Kingdom.-11-
2k.   There is a clear possibility that both the French and german governments would regard our participation in the project definitionstudy as a commitment to build a European airbus unless that studyrevealed new facts which invalidated the decision.     There would bescope for disagreement about these new facts and it is likely thatpolitically it would not be a good time to withdraw.     If, therefore,it were decided to embark on the project definition stage we considerthat it should he made clear, both to the German and French governments and publicly, that Her Majestyls Government has the clear right towithdraw from the project if the prerequisites   they think necessarycannot be achieved.Summary of PrpsjgJ^ts25.   We cannot predict the volume of sales which is most likely to beachieved, principally because of the difficulty of predicting the Europeanpenetration of the world market.     We are agreed that if launching costsdo not exceed  130 million 300 airbuses would have to be sold to achieve a return on the investment.     If the project is to have an identifiablechance of success, we are ?.greed that the United Kingdom should not proceed to the project definition stage unless it is -clearly understoodwith our partners that eventual production could only be contemplated ifthe five following prerequisites   were met -(i)    If there is an assured market for 75 airbuses in the threenational airlines, and if as a result of further marketresearch there is a reasonable expectation of at least50 sales to other airlines,(ii)    If the launching costs do not exceed the present estimate of 130 million and are re-examined at an early stage to see whether a significant reduction can be achieved,(iii)   If the Rolls-Royce engine is adopted,(iv)    If there is assurance that the target operating costs of30 per cent below current types, end the in-service dateof 1972-73, will be achieved,(v)   If the manufacturers will take a proper financial participation,i.e., normal production costs and, say, some 20 per cent ofdevelopment costs.It should be understood by our partners that our decision to proceed to production would be contingent on the overall response to these pre-requisites at the end of the project definition stage.     We are agreedthat the prerequisites   should be included in the tripartite Memorandumof Understanding..   As there is at present no assurance that any of theseprerequisites will be met, a full commitment now cannot be recommended.-1 2-CO N FIDE NT! AL
26.   Even if the five prerequisites   were met, there would still &quot;be no chance of commercial success unless we could be confident of securingsales equivalent to the entire world market outside the United States.The amount at risk in relation to this chance might be as much as 100 million for the United Kingdom.27.   Against this lack of assurance of commercial success there shouldbe set -(i)   the advantages to the balance of payments of co-operating in a european airbus instead of purchasing an American equivalent;(ii)   the advantages of maintaining the capability to develop largecivil aircraft, besides Concord;(iii)   the advantages of collaboration wdth Europe;(iv)   the avoidance of American monopoly;(v)   the unquantifiable political difficulty of withdrawal atthe present time.28.   The Treasury have felt bound to reserve their position on thefollowing main grounds -(a) Given the speculative sales prospects, the chance of aneconomic return on the project Is negligible   and asubstantial loss seems likely:   it will involve anincrease in the planned level of the basic public expenditure programmes over the next 5-6 years.(b) The development cost estimate of  130 million has been arrivedat independently by the manufacturers and the Ministry of technology.     Y/hile it would clearly he desirable to secure a reduction in the estimate and, more importantly, in theactual outturn,   previous experience points in the opposite direction.(c) The national airlines have in general displayed a lack ofenthusiasm for a 250-seat airbus on the time-scale end inthe numbers originally envisaged.     They cannot he compelledto buy it.     In these circumstances the airlines may wellseek to secure a high price (e.g. a guaranteed support) fromthe Government In return for a commitment to buy the airbus.(d) Not to proceed with this particular project would involve areduction in the size and capacity of the United Kingdomaircraft industry.     But the resources released would have an import-saving and export-earning capability.   The alternativeseems to he to maintain the industry at a higher level, atthe cost of a continuing (and potentially heavy) subsidy.-13-
Board of Trade also have reserved their position on the grounds that -While BEA accept that there is an eventual demand for an aircraft of this size, they feel it will to uneconomicuntil late in the 1970s.00There is substantial doubt whether investment in such an aircraft for use on the domestic routes would be justified,and therefore the economic comparison with purchases of an american aircraft is highly debateable, as is the estimateof the total BE/, demand.(c) A firm commitment by BEA is not to be expected save in returnfor an equally firm commitment by Her Majesty1 s G-overnmentto relieve BEA of any consequent diseconomy.(d) A decision on the airbus is being taken before one, moreimportant to BSA, about an earlier and intermediate aircraft,and is calculated to prejudice any decision made on the latter.Conclusions30.   Bearing in mind both the financial risks involved and the wider considerations, the Committee recommend (the Treasury and the Board ofTrade reserving their position) that, if the five prerequisites mentionedin paragraph 25 above can be firmly agreed with our prospective partners,we should enter into an agreement to proceed with the project definitionstage.     It must however be recognised that this will in practice imply a commitment on our part to proceed to completion if the prerequisiteconditions are fulfilled.Cabinet Office, SA7.1 .14th March 1967-14-

Some explanations of, or reservations about, the calculations are set out below -(a) It is assumed that a European airbus would have a Rolls Royceengine.   If a United States engine were employed, theintention would be to produce it in Europe.   Some parts ofthe engine would, however, probably be produced in theUSA and the United Kingdom share of European production would be lower than in the case of a Rolls Royce engine.These two factors would diminish the foreign exchangebenefits of the European aircraft to the United Kingdom,but are not at present quantifiable.(b) If only 20 airbuses are required by BEA, there would beforeign exchange earnings for the United Kingdom on allsales above AO 4- aircraft, because the United kingdom share of airframe and engine together is approximately50 per cent.   Similarly, for a BEA requirement of 40aircraft, foreign exchange earnings start at sales above80 h-.(c) Although figures are shown for the sale of only 50aircraft, such a level of sales would represent virtuallycomplete failure of the project.(d) Calculations are not shown for sales of 300 aircraft.   Bythis point the prefect is fully commercially viable.   Clearlythere is a considerable gain to the balance of payments.(e) The calculations have not been discounted.   Launching costs,but act production costs, vrould be incurred earlier in time than in the case of a United States purchase;   foreignexehange earnings vrould be spread over a period of time; and credit sales or purchases would affect net present value.(f) The foreign exchange earnings are also gross.   It is highlyprobable that if we did not make the airbus, the resourcesreleased would produce goods of which a proportion would be exported.   We cannot quantify this effect (no studies have beenmade for this industry).(2)

Over the &quot;whole period costs andrevenues for BEA of the order of  2,000 million are involved.O
-j,    This table does not include -(a) the possibility of BEA buying BAC2-11 aircraft with the newRB engines. This was BEA&apos;s preferred choice but the productionof the RB engine at the same time as the Rolls Royce engine forthe airbus is beyond the firm&apos;s industrial capacity;(b) the VC10 as an alternative in a BEA purchase of 20 airbuses;it would in any case be more costly than the Trident 3B;(c) the Boeing 727 as an alternative in a BEA purchase of20 airbuses;   Ministers have already ruled out this course.2.    We have not included balance of payments effects in the table, but itmust be borne in mind that alternative 4 (15 Boeing 727s) involvesdollar expenditure of about  50 million.3,     The figure for losses to Her Majesty&apos;s Government on the airbus assumes that 100 would be sold if BEA take 20, and 150 vrould be sold if BEA take45.    This is illustrative only;   it allows for a relative increa.sein total sales if BEA take the larger number&quot;.     The full range of losses on alternative assumptions is as follows -Sales of Airbuses 85        100        105        150 200Losses ( million) 59 55 53 33.5 124.     Courses 1,2,3 and 4 reflect figures supplied by BEA with some adjustment to the number of Boeing aircraft in the latter case        insteadof 1S7 to be consistent with a buy of 45 airbuses.5.     Courses 5 and 6 are based on the assumption that 15 Boeings(Course 4) are replaced by VC10s   and Trident 3Bs   respectively, givingapproximately the same seating capacity.     These estimates have beenprepared by officials without consultation with BEA and consequently without regard to traffic matching, timetabling and load factors.6.     The figures for Launching Costs assume 100 per cent support from her Majesty&apos;s Government though Government policy is not yet decided.     Nosales other than to BEA can be assumed for BAC2-11s, VC10s and Tridents.
