5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT)I have now held further consultations with the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) on thelines agreed by the Cabinet on 14th February (CC(67) 8th Conclusions,Minute 2).Statutory pov/ers2.       I explained to both organisations that the Government had giventhe most careful consideration to the views which they had expressed onearlier occasions but remained of the view that, given the economicsituation, it would not be possible to move immediately from the presentphase in which the Government possess wide (though not widely used)powers under Part IV to one in which no powers were available to theGovernment other than the early warning and very limited standstillpowers in Part II.3.       I emphasised that this did not mean that the Government regarded the prices and incomes policy as something which they could impose onthe trade unions and management.    On the contrary we attached the verygreatest importance to the successful development of the influence whichthe TUC and CBI could exercise in their respective spheres by vettingprocedures and in other ways.    But the TUC and CBI had alwaysadmitted that they would be faced with great difficulties in making a voluntary policy effective in cases where a minority challenged the policyand that being so the Government would be doing less than their duty tothe country if they did not hold some powers in reserve for at least alimited period after next August,4,      I put to them that in the circumstances the Government believedthat the right course for the twelve months after severe restraint wouldbe to make such use as might be necessary of the present powers in Part and beyond that to seek for a further period of one year powers whichwould enable vis to give statutory force to recommendations by theNational Board frr Prices and Incomes (NBPI) (on the lines set out inparagraph 32 of C(67) 13).    There would be no provision for prolongingthese new powers beyond a year without further legislation.    On theother hand no undertaking could be given at this stage whether when thetime came such legislation would be brought in or not.C(67) 2021st February, 1967COPY NO.CABINETTHE FUTURE OF PRICES AND INCOMES policy memorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic Affairs-1-
5.      The General Council of the TUC will be discussing this matter onWednesday, 22nd February and I will report the outcome orally to theCabinet.    The general reaction of the Economic Committee of the TUCto this new proposal was, however, no more favourable than it had been previously.    The TUC are still determined to stand out against any newpowers.    They are more mistrustful of the role of the NBPI than the cbi and the proposal to interpose the Board between the Government and exercise of new powers has not been received by most members of theEconomic Committee as a helpful factor in the issue of powers.    My own view is that the vote at the Conference of the Trade Union Executives on 2nd March, while of considerable importance, should not be decisive ininfluencing our attitude whether or not to go ahead with our legislative proposals.    What really matters is the general feeling of trade unionistsand the wider public about the need to deal with those groups who are determined to flout the policy.    It is only fair to say that the TUC do not see it like this.    They think that the vote in favour of their own proposals at the Conference will be seriously reduced if the Government persistswith its statutory proposals and that this will effectively prevent thesuccessful development of a voluntary policy.6.      The Council of the CBI discussed the matter on Wednesday,15th February.    The CBI certainly do not v/elcome legislation on thelines which we now have in mind, but it seems clear that their hostilityhas been substantially softened on the basis that we limit our new powersto enforcement of NBPI recommendations and to a period of twelve months.7.      There are two particular difficulties for the CBI;-(i)  They, like the TUC, wish us to give voluntaryism a clear run by not even activating Part JJ until it can be shown that voluntaryearly warning of increases in prices and pay is not working.(ii)  They reacted very sharply to the proposal that our powers toenforce NBPI recommendations should cover recommendations that prices should be reduced (in cases where the criteria ofparagraph 10 of Cmnd. 2639 are found to apply).I made it clear that we felt it would be right to&apos; activate Part II beforePart IV lapsed even though it would not be our intention to requirestatutory early warning on a comprehensive basis.    I also emphasised that we considered it an essential part of the prices and incomes policy to look for price reductions to offset unavoidable increases elsewhere andthat we could not, therefore, exclude from the powers to give effect toNBPI recommendations power to require reductions in prices.Powers8.      As a result of the Cabinet&apos;s continuing appraisal of the question ofpowers in the light of CBI and TUC reactions, we have reached the presentposition:(i)  Part II (statutory early warning and short stand stills pendingexamination by NBPI) t o be activated before the lapse of thepresent Part IV;  the precise use to be made of Part II powersto depend on the situation in the summer, but no present intentionof requiring early warning statutorily over a very wide field.-2-SECRET
(ii) Any new powers to be taken for 12 months only with no built-in power to renew them so tha t a fresh Bill would have to beintroduced if we subsequently thought it right to retain all or some of the powers.    We have given no pledge so far about not seeking such legislation in 1968.(iii) The new powers to cover:(a) lengthening the maximum period of standstill on priceor pay increases to 12 months;(b) prevention of retrospective payment of pay increases for the standstill period;(c) reduction of prices.(iv) These powers to be exerciseable only where the N3PI has sorecommended, but the Government would be free, of course,to decide not to use the powers.9.      These pov/ers will not in practice be as wide as they seem.    the limitations imposed by the interposition of the NBPI are very substantial:(i)  The NBPI could be expanded, but it could not take a great manyreferences and prepare worthwhile reports on them at one time,in particular, we would have to be prepared to let some of thesmaller cases involving breach of the policy go by default.(ii)  The NBPI is not infallible and it might find it difficult in somecases to reach specific conclusions.    We should then be unableto use the reserve powers.(iii)  There are bound to be some cases in which the Board!s findingswill not conform with the Governments view of the needs of thesituation.    We should again in this situation have no effective powers.10.       There is one further point to which I must draw the Cabinet&apos;attention.    As the Prime Minister said in his summing up on 14th February,we must put to the CBI and TUC, before the Trade Union Conference on 2nd March, the package of proposals which we believe to be necessary because of the extreme difficulty, if not impossibility, of then going beyond the proposals.11.       In addition to the proposals in paragraph 8 above, I have mentioned to the CBI the problem of those who may be tempted to &quot;beat the gun&quot; and increase prices or pay without giving the Government advancenotification.    As I explained in paragraph 6 of Annex A to C(67) 13, thiswould be a risk even if we imposed statutory notification of proposed increases on quite a wide scale.    It would be a much more serious riskif we decided only to ask for very selective statutory notification, as the cbi and TUC are urging us to do.-3-
12.      The best way of dealing with this problem would be to take powerto require reversion of increases in pay or prices which have taken placeif those increases were being referred to the NBPI.    Such powers wouldhave to be exerciseable at the Governments own hand.    If the NBPIrecommended that the increases in question should not be further held up,the price or pay revision orders would be revoked.13.      The CBI were very hostile to the idea of the government themselves having such a power, despite the fact that it would do no morethan enable us to treat fairly all parties whose proposals are referred tothe NBPI.    The TUC would be no less hostile to our taking this power.But I do not think we should drop the idea without careful consideration,because without it we would be putting a premium on selfish action.    as my colleagues know, we have relied on voluntary early warning evenduring the standstill because we had power under Part IV to requirereversion of a price or pay increase and the voluntary system has worked well with this power in reserve.14.      The statutory powers now in view are far more restricted in practical terms than those which I originally outlined and it is temptingto say that one more limitation hardly matters if the power involved islikely to cause further serious difficulty with the CBI and TUC.    against this, if we are prepared to activate Part II and to take power to enforce the recommendations of the NBPI, it v/ould be bound to look odd andillogical if we were to leave such a serious loophole for the actions ofthe selfish minority.    I recommend, therefore, that we should seek this power to require temporary reversion of price or pay increases whichhave &quot;beaten the gun&quot;.Norm and Criteria15.       I explored with the TUC and CBI the suggestion which was discussed at our last meeting that instead of fixing a percentage norm for pay increases we might adopt the concept of a national dividend in the form ofa global sum of money which was available in each year for distribution in increased wages and salaries.    Neither organisation saw anyattraction in this idea and indeed the TUC expressed themselves most strongly against it.16.       Although, as was pointed out at our last meeting, there could be some advantages in presenting the norm idea in this way, it is clear that&quot;a national dividend&quot; is not different in substance from a percentage normbut is a different way of expressing it.    It would, of course, be a simplematter for people to convert the money figure of the national dividend intoa percentage figure and there v/ould be a strong temptation to regard thispercentage as the minimum rate of increase.    Experience has shown thatunion leaders would feel compelled to negotiate on the basis of gettingsomething more than this percentage as proof of their bargaining powerand skill.17.      I believe that this concept might become more acceptable as part ofour presentation of any norm in the longer term and I should in any casehope to continue to discuss with the TUC and CBI the whole problem howan incomes norm can best be arrived at and publicly presented.    In these discussions we should have an opportunity to explore further suchconcepts as a national dividend,-4-
18.       But for our immediate purposes - and as the year advances thematter is becoming increasingly urgent - I see no alternative to facingsquarely the issue of the norm and criteria on the lines summarised inparagraphs 19-25 of C(67) 13.    It is obvious that in our present economicsituation we could not possibly justify a norm as high as - still lesshigher than - the level of 3-3-1 Per cent which should have prevailed upto July, 1966.    I suggest that there are two alternatives for consideration for the tv/elve months beginning 1st July, 1967:-   either the principle thatno-one is entitled to an annual increase without justification in relation tocriteria which would be close to the more flexible criteria of the white paper (Cmnd. 2639) which was agreed by the Government, CBI and TUC -this is the real meaning of a &quot;nil norm&quot;;  or a low norm which to preservea credible relation with the likely growth of productivity would have to beno more than 2 per cent together with stricter criteria which would becloser to those for the present period of severe restraint (Cmnd. 3150).19-.       The first of these courses seems to me the better one for thetfollowing reasons.-(i)  It would mean that no-one would be entitled to expect a pay increasemerely through the passage of time (and it was the shortening ofthe interval between pay increases which was so damaging to thepolicy before the standstill).    All increases would have to be viewed a.gainst the criteria.    This would help to retain an atmosphere of restraint after 30th June.    On the other hand,adoption of more flexible criteria would avoid giving theimpression that the Government were determined to maintainthe freeze for a further year.(ii)  It would avoid the implication of our setting a national productivitytarget at a time when our general economic plan has not yet been revised and would give the Government more discretion in the timing of reflationary measures.(iii) It would reduce the area for argument and disagreement with the tuc and CBI.    Adoption of a 2 per cent norm v/ould raise in an acute form with those organisations the question of what rate of growth the Government should be aiming at.    This might resultin the TUC or CBI (or both together) promulgating a normdifferent from that of the Government.(iv) A 2 per cent norm would become the minumum pay increase andall unions and most employers would start bargaining from this level.20.      I am fortified in this view by the outcome of my latest consultations with the TUC and CBI.    The TUC have not told me explicitly that theywould welcome a nil norm.    I did not expect them to do so.    But this is what they are in fact expecting and I do not think there is any reason to doubt that they would prefer this to a very low norm and stricter criteriawhich would almost certainly force them to put out their own versions ofwhat the norm and criteria should be.    The CBI would certainly regard the nil norm with more flexible criteria as appropriate to our present economic situation and think that it v/ould be more likely to create theright atmosphere than a norm of say 2 per cent.-5-8ECRET
21.      I recognise that many of my colleagues, particularly those responsible for pay in the public services, may feel concern lest theabsence of a positive norm should imply a severity of restriction on pay increases over the next twelve months which is unlikely to be secured inthe private sector with or without statutory powers.    But I suggest that itis misleading to consider the norm in isolation from the criteria withwhich it would be associated.    What we are seeking to do is not to barpay increases after 30th June but to secure a realistic degree of restraint in the timing and size of increases.    The onus would rest on the partiesproposing increases to have proper regard to the reasonable criteria onthe lines of Cmnd. 2639 and this would be far indeed from imposing afreeze on the public services.    We have shown during the standstill thatwe are not, unlike our predecessors, picking on the public services.Indeed many private employers feel that we have been less severe on thepublic services than they are urged to be.Phasing of increases after June 196722.      As I mentioned in my earlier memorandum (C(67) 13, paragraph 34)regard will need to be paid during the period immediately after severe restraint to which workers have, and which have not, obtained increases in the twelve months ended 30th June, 1967.    It seems to me that we must seek to establish three principles:-(i)  The least we must ask is that those who have received increases under deferred commitments or under the severe restraintcriteria should wait at least twelve months for further improvements under new agreements.(ii) We also need to reaffirm the statement in the White Paper on prices and Incomes Standstill (Cmnd. 3073, paragraph 23) thatit v/ould defeat our intention if the parties concerned were to seek to make good in subsequent negotiations any increasesforgone as a result of the standstill and severe restraint.(iii) It also seems desirable that large adjustments in pay required tomeet exceptional circumstances should be phased over two ormore years.We should be making good progress in dealing with the problems of the transitional period if we could establish these principles in agreement withthe CBI and TUC.    More ambitious proposals, such as consideration ofthe main pay claims together in order to establish priorities or general acceptance of a minimum increase for the two-year period July, 1966 toJune 1968, with very few exceptions above this level, do not seem to be practical politics at the present time.The Next Steps23.      I would therefore propose, if my colleagues agree, to continue discussions with the CBI and the TUC on the basis of the legislative proposals outlined above and with the object of securing agreement on a&quot;nil norm&quot; and criteria along the lines of those in the White Paper(Cmnd. 2639) and on principles for dealing with the transitional problemsof phasing increases after 30th June, 1967, leaving the final decisions to be-6-
taken by the Government after the Conference of Trade Union Executiveson 2nd March.    This means that we shall not be in a position to inform parliament of our firm intentions until after the Conference,    We must recognise that in following this course we lay ourselves open to criticism at home and possibly overseas for our apparent indecision in determining the next phase of the policy, given that consultations with the cbi and TUC have been continuing for some weeks.M.S.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.1.21st February, 1967-7-
