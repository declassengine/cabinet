^- tooCONFIDENTIAL. x 0 0THISS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)22nd February, 1967CABINETTELEVISION IN THE HOUSE OF LORDSMemorandum by the Lord President of the Counciland the Lord Privy seal the Cabinet decided on 10th November, 1966 (CC(66) 56thConclusions, Minute 7) on the basis of a paper put forward by us both(C(66) 147) to authorise a joint experiment in televising both Houses ofParliament in the spring of 1968 for a short period.    The cost, to bemet by a supplementary vote, was to be  15 0, 000 for the Commons and 18,000 for the Lords,     This decision was without commitment to any permanent arrangement, and was to be subject to a free vote in either house.     The Lord President in his speech to the Commons on24th November put this decision on record (H, C. Hansard, Vol. 736,cols.  1612-3).    In the event the Commons rejected the experiment inthe Commons.The Lords had already decided in principle that they wished fora TV experiment.     The lords  Select Committee was in some doubt about the  18,000 which had been earmarked for the Lords, since itwas not clear whether the commons vote would result in the withdrawalof the offer of the   18, 000 which had been made by the Government.The Report of their Select Committee will soon be published and, in the debate on it, it will be necessary for the Government spokesman toindicate what the Cabinet has decided on this.The object of the experiment which the lords  Select Committeeis suggesting would be to produce a series of dummy programmesincluding edited versions of debates, news flashes and so on whichwould be shown to the House of Lords and made available to the House ofCommons, if it so wished.    It is understood that the estimated cost onthe lines now suggested of a one-House three-day experiment, would be 16,500, rather less than was originally authorised for the Lords&apos;share of the Joint Experiment.We hope that our colleagues will agree that we should not denythe money up to   18, 000 which had previously been offered.The Lord Chancellor concurs in our proposal.R.H. S, C.L.Privy Council Office, S. W. 1.21st February, 1967
