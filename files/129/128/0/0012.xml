C(67) 12 COPY NO. G J30th January, 1967CABINETTHE KENNEDY ROUNDMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Prime Minister asked me to circulate a short paper on what we have all been trying to achieve in the Kennedy Round, together with my views on what is likely to be realisable.Kennedy Round Objectives2.       The objectives agreed by the Ministers of the Contracting parties in 1963-64 were,  &quot;as a working hypothesis&quot;, tariff reductions of50 per cent across the board, with a bare minimum of exceptions.The negotiations were also to cover non-tariff barriers to trade andwere to provide for &quot;acceptable conditions of access to world markets and furtherance of a significant expansion of world trade for agricultural products&quot;.    Every effort was to be made to reduce barriers to exportsof the developing countries.    Agreement on the &quot;working Hypothesis&quot;was linked with the solution of the other problems in the negotiations andwith the achievement of reciprocity.Britain&apos;s objectives3.      BritainTs main concern has been to secure significant tariff reductions in the markets of the European Economic Community (e.c.),United States of America and Japan, in that order; and the reduction ofnon-tariff barriers mainly in the United States of America.4.       It will pay us to get the best result we can from the Kennedy Roundwhether or not we join the e.c. in the near future.    If we do not join,a successful Kennedy Round will be of very great importance to us in reducing the discrimination against our exports to the Six which results from the absence of tariffs on their internal trade and in lessening theeconomic division of Europe.    K, on the other hand, we enter the EECthere will still be considerable advantages in the reduction of tariffs and non-tariff barriers to our exports to the United States, Japan and othercountries.    If our industries are strong enough to face complete free trade with Europe in the event of our joining the e.c. any reductions inour tariffs made in the Kennedy Round should cause them little trouble.Prospect for Industrial Products5,      We can expect the bargains to be struck at the lowest commondenominator of offers, for each participant will presumably adjust hisoffers to match the advantages he expects from the negotiations as a whole.-1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)
confidential.       The Six negotiate as one, but France and Italy are lessinterested in the Kennedy Round than Germany and Benelux.    Frenchand Italian industries, traditionally highly protected, have recently seenconsiderable reductions in their tariffs, particularly against their common Market partners, and also against other countries.    Many ofthem feel that they have had just about as much trade liberalisation asthey can take for the present, though they would perhaps not be averseto a modest exchange of concessions designed to increase their tradewith the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).    The General isprejudiced against the Kennedy Round because it was part of the atlantic Grand Design.Prospects for Agricultural Products7.      The United States regard it as politically essential to achieve a worthwhile settlement in agriculture and particularly on cereals.Agricultural products form a quarter of United States exports.8.      An international cereals agreement might be of value to theUnited Kingdom if it:(a)    secured a reasonable level of prices for our imports of wheat and coarse grains; andenabled us to replace our present bilateral cereals agreements with our principal suppliers by arrangements which would allowus to exploit more fully the expansion of domestic cerealsproduction as a means of import saving.Maximum prices at a reasonable level would safeguard the consumerand our balance of payments and minimum prices enable us to limit theexchequer cost of deficiency payments to our farmers.9.       The proposals under discussion provide for minimum and maximum prices for cereals higher than the present international wheat agreement prices  a self-sufficiency ratio to be prescribed for eachproducing and consuming country with penalties to be paid in money or in kind for production in excess of this ratio;  and possibly somecontributions to a world food aid scheme.    As the price of an agreementwe shall have to agree to somewhat higher maximum and minimum prices and possibly to contribute to the food aid programme.    Whether or not we can accept an agreement will depend very largely on the extent towhich the self-sufficiency ratio that we can engotiate will give usfreedom to expand domestic production and reduce imports.    The ideas of the exporters (the United States, Canada, Australia and Argentina)are at present a long way from our own and it is too soon to predict the outcome with any confidence.10.      It is unlikely that any significant arrangements will be agreed forother major agricultural products for which groups have been set up(meat, dairy products).    For the rest, we can expect a limited numberof tariff bargains which should help our exports of manufacturedfoodstuffs though reducing some of the preferences we give theC commonwealth.-2-CONFIDEMTiAL
Timing11.       The United States Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which provides the United States Administration with its negotiating authority, expireson 30th June, 1967.    It is most unlikely that the United StatesGovernment would want or could obtain an extension to enablenegotiations to continue.    This means that the final bargain must be struck at latest in April or May.12.       Tariff concessions agreed in the Kennedy Round will probablybegin to be implemented in 1968, but it is likely to be four or five years before they are all implemented in full.Balance of advantage13.      It is impossible at the present stage of these complicatedmultilateral negotiations to foresee how the balance over all may turnout from our point of view.    It is clear that we shall have to withdrawsubstantially from our initial offers and there are whole sectors in theindustrial field where, if adequate reciprocity is not forthcoming in thesame sector, no deal will be possible.    I believe the odds at presentare against significant tariff reductions being made in iron and steel,motor vehicles, cotton and wool textiles and probably chemicals,aluminium and pulp and paper.    There is nevertheless a reasonable prospect that many other tariffs will be substantially reduced, mainly on some engineering and consumer goods.    As regards non-tariff barriers, it is by no means certain that we shall get worthwhileconcessions from the Americans.    On the two most important - theirmethod of assessing duty on whisky imported in bottle and on certainchemicals - a change in practice would need fresh legislation by congress.    American action on these items will have an important bearing on our readiness to maintain some of our offers.    Whether ornot a cereals agreement will be acceptable to us as part of the overallsettlement is likely to depend not only on the terms of the agreementitself but also on the balance of advantage in other sectors of thenegotiations and on whether the Americans make it an absolutecondition of any settlement at all.14.       We shall have to make the best judgment we can when we havepushed the negotiating process as far as it will go and the time comes,probably in April, to strike a balance.    The Kennedy Round will fall along way short of fulfilling the high hopes of 1962.    But if it succeedsat all I think that it will probably achieve considerably more tha.n its predecessor, the Dillon Round, which resulted in the reduction of ourtariffs by about 20 per cent on about half our dutiable industrial importsfrom the United States of America and the e.c. in return for comparableconcessions to us.D.P.T..J.Board of Trade, S.W.1.30th January, 1967-3-
