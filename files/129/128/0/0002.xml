CONFIDENTIALIhIS -DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 210th January, 1967COPY NO,CABINETPAY INCREASE FOR LIMB FITTERS^e^ora5VA^r?v*?y /ft^M^ffll^3:. pl HealthAfter the decision in August by Messrs. J. E. Hanger to deferany increas e in the pay of lirnb fitters, in conformity with theGovernments standstill on prices and incomes, the fitters employedby the Company at Roehampton and certain other limb fitting centresbegan working to rule on 2nd September and continued to do so until5th December,2.      This action had serious effects on the treatment of the limbless.At Roehampton the numbers attended to during September averagedTOO a v/eek instead of the normal figure of 900 and despite all we could do to maintain the service the waiting list continued to grow.    At thebeginning of December there were about 900 limbless patients waiting for a new limb or a major repair as compared with the normal figureof 5 00;   and in spite of sustained efforts by all concerned in the monthsince normal working was resumed the waiting list at present standsat 75 0.    Many patients suffered considerable hardship and inconveniencein having to attend repeatedly at the Centre before they succeeded in securing attention from a limb fitter and many more have been seriously affected by the aggravated delay in the delivery or major repair of an artificial limb,3.      If an order is made now to prevent payment under the agreementbetween the Company and the Union it is likely that the fitters willrenew their work-to-rule and that this time the disruption will notbe confined to Roehampton and the two larger Centres at liverpool and Birmingham but will affect every one of the twenty-eight centres in the United Kingdom,4.      There is little or no emergency action that we could take toprovide alternative arrangements for maintaining  the limb serviceand many patients, some of them with grave disabilities, would inevitably suffer.    All this would be seen to be the result of a deliberate decision of Government, taken after the Government had appeared to acquiesce in the settlement over a month ago which brought the industrial action to an end.    1/7e should have the greatest difficultyin defending our actions in Parliament and outside from attacks by theOpposition, the Press and organisations representing the interests ofthe disabled.     Public opinion is not likely to be on our side.5,,      I therefore suggest to my colleagues that the disadvantages ofmaking an Order outweigh the advantages and that consideration of anysuch action should be postponed at any rate until after the national board for Prices and Incomes has reported.Ministry of Health, S, E. 1.10th January, 1967 CONFIDENTIALK.R.
