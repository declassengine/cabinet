this document is the property ofher britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1967C(67) 37 Copy No.   gg28th March, 1967CABINETCOMMONWEALTH SECRETARY^ VISIT TO THEFAR east memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the following report on my recent tour of the Far East.2. I visited Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, singapore and Hong Kong during a tour lasting from 10 February to 8 March.The main purpose of my tour was familiarisation, but runningthrough it were two themes of substance our relations with theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) and our Far East defence policy. I deal with these two subjects separately below, but givefirst some brief impressions of each country individually.Fiji3. The most important fact about Fiji is that the native Fijianscomprise only 42 per cent of the population whereas the Indians(descendants of immigrant labour brought in under our rule)comprise 50 per cent. Most of the Indians are therefore pressing for &quot; one man, one vote&quot; on a common roll in expectation ofdominating the political life of the country. For this purpose theyare seeking support from the United Nations Committee of Twenty-Four. The Fijians are alive to this and are at last coming out oftheir political shell. They are tough and determined, and I am convinced that any early move towards majority rule and an Indiandominated independence would lead to bloodshed and chaos.Indeed independence may not even be the right objective in Fiji.4. Elections were held only last year under a revisedConstitution. The Government is formed by the predominantlyFijian but multi-racial Alliance Party under Ratu Mara. I took theline publicly that it was necessary to go slow and allow time to gain experience of the new Constitution. I discouraged suggestions for a United Nations mission to Fiji, but I persuaded Ratu Mara thatthere would be advantage in his going privately to New York toput the Fijian case to influential representatives there. I am sure that the main hope is to allow this new multi-racial party to takeroot and develop. I am examining whether anything can be done to enable it to learn something of party organisation in this country.7737A
5. Economically Fiji suffers from being a sugar monoculture.It is heavily dependent on the Commonwealth Sugar agreement under which it is marketing 140 thousand tons of sugar at  47 10s.per ton, or over twice the current world market price. The FijiGovernment is in difficulty over financing its development planfollowing the refusal of a loan of  3-3 million sterling by theAustralian Government. I had some discussion on this in Canberraand am doubtful whether the Australian Government will reversetheir decision, though it may be possible to find other means ofmaking the money available from Australian sources. In addition toour assistance to the Fiji Development Plan we are proposing tomake available  1,250,000 over five years towards the establishmentof a Regional University of the South Pacific in Fiji.6. I was disturbed at the morale of HMOCS officers in Fijiand I understand that morale is even worse in our smaller and more remote Pacific territories. They feel they are part of a contractingservice on unduly depressed salary rates. The commonwealth office and Ministry of Overseas Development are sending a missionnext month to see what can be done.New Zealand7. No one who visits New Zealand can fail to be remindedof how close they still are to us and how dependent on useconomically. Life still proceeds at the more leisurely pace of anout-of-the-way English county though American influence is slowlyincreasing in the towns. After some years of agricultural prosperitythey are now facing a severe balance of payments problem andeconomic recession. The price of wool has fallen so far that a large part of last year&apos;s crop is still held in store by the Wool Board, whowill be unable to maintain the current guaranteed price next year.Subsidies have been cut and import restrictions imposed; but evensterner measures will probably be necessary.8. In my discussions with the New Zealand Cabinet, apart fromEEC and defence, I spoke about Rhodesia, Malta, Britain&apos;s economy and Mr. Kosygin&apos;s visit. The New Zealand Trade Minister madea considerable issue of the growing imports of near butter into thiscountry from Europe which he said threatened to undermine the quota system.9. I was impressed by the new Leader of the Labour Party,Mr. Kirk; he has a very wide grasp of international affairs and an extensive knowledge of South-East Asia. He did not take over intime to establish his mark effectively during the recent election. i hope that an opportunity will arise for him to visit this country,possibly under the auspices of the Commonwealth ParliamentaryAssociation.Australia10. I paid a brief visit to Tasmania to see the tragic resultsof the recent fire devastation.   I think this was greatly appreciated.11. I also visited Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney and Perth,where I made speeches, and called briefly at Adelaide. In Melbourne
I took Rhodesia as the main theme of my speech, and in Sydney I did my best to publicise some of Britain&apos;s recent economic and scientific achievements. In Perth I encountered a small pro-Smithdemonstration, and I understand that my Melbourne speech hasprovoked a large number of letters; but I am sure it was right topublicise our case.12. In Canberra I attended the State Opening of parliament and was invited to take a seat on the floor of both Houses. I feltI was given an extremely warm welcome by Australian Ministers.They were anxious to hear of our economic recovery and tounderstand our point of view, with the possible exception of theMinister of Trade, Mr. McEwen, in relation to e.c.. On all sidesthe hope was expressed that the voluntary programme of restrictionson sterling investments would soon be lifted.13. The question of the entry of Australians into Britain underthe Commonwealth Immigrants Act proved to be less sensitive than   had expected. This is probably because most come as visitorsand experience little difficulty; but the long delay in issuing workpermits is hard to defend. The feeling of resentment at having toapply for an entry permit is tending to die out. I heard fewcomplaints of the 80,000 British migrants whom we are still sending to Australia each year.14. In general Australians are still desperately anxious to hearwell of us and cherish their connection with the &quot;old country &quot;; butthe new generation, especially on the Eastern seaboard, is inevitablylooking more to the United States.Malaysia15. I was impressed by the way in which the different racesare co-operating. During my visit the Bill to make Malay thenational language was introduced into Parliament; with his usualadroitness the Tunku seemed to have made sufficient concessions to each side to secure general acceptance. Anglo-Malaysian relations were climbing out of the trough into which they plunged last year.I had to take a firm line with the Finance Minister, Mr. Tan Siew Sin,over the overdue instalment of the War Damage CompensationLoan. I think the Malaysians will pay; but Mr. Tan expressed thehope that we could make it up in some other way. I am sure thatsome financial gesture on our part would pay enormous politicaldividends. One way of doing this would be to make negligiblecharges for the camps handed over by us and for our continuinglogistic support to the Malaysian forces in East Malaysia.16. The Tunku is talking of taking six months&apos; leave and thereis much speculation about his early retirement. I doubt myselfwhether he intends to let go the reins just yet. Tun Razak stillstands as his successor. I found him impressive and with a firmgrip on the many problems he handles. It is nevertheless difficultto forecast whether major changes should be expected in Malaysia&apos;spolicies if he took over. The enigma is the extent to which he may come under the influence of Malay extremists.7737
17. I found the Tunku still concerned about allegations ofdisloyalty to Malaysia on the part of certain British officers in Sabahand Sarawak. At his request I made a public statement intendedto discourage any thoughts of British support for separatism in those two States.Singapore18. I was treated to an hour and a halfs tour de force byMr. Lee Kuan Yew who ranged over almost every topic except theone which must surely be preoccupying him most the rundown ofour troops and facilities in the base. (I refer to this in more detailbelow.) This brilliant man still seems obsessed with past mistakeswhich led to the separation of Singapore from Malaysia and did his best to remove the favourable impressions I had formed of hisnorthern neighbour. Although there have been one or two more hopeful signs recently, it would be wrong to expect any dramaticimprovement in relations between the two countries. The mainother message Mr. Lee was doing his best to convey to me was his great need for British investment capital, especially in the new industrial estate.Hong Kong19. Hong Kong is the eighth wonder of the world. 98 per centChinese, the size of a small English county but with nearly 4 million people, it has tackled the problems arising from the vast influx of immigrants across the border with unbelievable vigour and enterprise. It rehouses a population the size of York every year outof current revenue. Immense land reclamation and water supplyschemes are in hand. Yet it lives on a knife edge for just so longas China is willing to accept the status quo; and the lease of the NewTerritories expires in 1997. Its achievements and its future dependon confidence the confidence of the people and, it must be said,Communist China that we will continue to govern firmly, resistexternal pressures for elected self-government and provide a crediblegarrison. The Administration is frankly colonial, but that is theway the people want it; if an elected eleritent were introduced intothe Legislative Council this would bring into the open andprecipitate a clash between the supporters of the rival ideologies ofTaiwan and Peking. It would then be harder for Peking to stand aside. The Chinese population would be split and would seek toreinsure; there would be no stopping this process once started. Forthat reason we are clearly right in our decision to do nothing to disturb the status quo. The Governor is, however, studying thepossibility of some reforms in local government which wouldassociate the people more closely with the management of localaffairs.20. The Government of Hong Kong have done so much for themselves that they tend to feel forgotten by us. For that reasonany gesture demonstrating continued interest and concern wouldbe very welcome. One possibility mentioned to me was theprovision of aid finance for the extension of the airport runway.
Far East defence21. As agreed with the Defence Secretary I took the line withAustralian and New Zealand Ministers that our policy remainedmuch as in last year&apos;s Defence White Paper; that because ofthe ending of confrontation we were reducing to Defence Reviewlevels earlier than we had expected; that some further reductionsseemed likely, especially in administrative services; but that before any further substantial reduction below Defence Review levels tookplace, there would be full consultation with them. I took broadly the same line with Malaysian and Singapore Ministers, though bythat time the debate on the Defence Estimates had taken place inthe House of Commons.22. In New Zealand Mr. Holyoake stressed that they hadtaken tremendous comfort from the Prime Minister^ statement lastyear that we intended to continue a military presence East of Suez.He was quite reconciled to reductions to Defence Review levels. he mentioned to me the likelihood that he would shortly wish to reinforce the New Zealand contingent in Vietnam by rotating one company from the New Zealand battalion in the CommonwealthBrigade. It was clear that New Zealand felt she should do more to match the Australian contribution in Vietnam.23. In Canberra Mr. Holt had seen our 1967 Defence white paper and remarked that it appeared to continue the existing policy,but there were some alterations in wording which might or mightnot have significance. As expected he stressed the importance attached by Australia to a continuing British presence in the far east. Some of his colleagues expressed concern at Singapore&apos;future between the Malay nutcracker of Indonesia and Malaysia.It was clear that both the Australians and New Zealanders attached the greatest importance to our staying in Singapore; the size of our forces was less significant. But they remain very anxious about our long-term intentions.24. There was considerable local interest in Perth about thepossibility of the Royal Navy participating in the new Naval Base atCockburn Sound. It was clear the expectations were out of all proportion to reality, but I think I was able to put the recordstraight.25. In Malaysia the Tunku asked for further information about our intentions following the Defence Secretary&apos;s speech in theHouse, and Tun Razak reminded me that under the MalaysianDefence Agreement we were obliged to consult them before makingchanges in the character or deployment of our forces in Malaysia.There was also some public concern over possible redundancies inlocally employed personnel.26. In Singapore, as I have mentioned, there was a strangeevasion of any discussion on possible reductions in the base. Thereare various explanations, the two most likely being either thatSingapore Ministers wish to reserve their fire for a major demarchepossibly after they have seen the outcome of the Malta talks; orconversely that they are so anxious to retain our presence for as long
as possible that they will do their best to make no difficulties overreductions. Mr. Lee&apos;s line with me was that he fully understood our difficulties and would do his best to co-operate. I of courseexplained that we would consult fully with him before any decisions on further reductions in Singapore were reached.27. I am left with a feeling of considerable anxiety over what may happen in Singapore if we seek to reduce too drastically or tooquickly. Unemployment is already running at about 12 per cent and is rising sharply every year as a result of a natural increase inthe working population. Some 25 per cent of the National income is generated by our military presence. Precipitate action by us couldclearly have far-reaching political consequences.28. Although I realise that we have decided that one majorunit should be withdrawn at some point during 1967-68, in HongKong the Governor and his Advisers stressed that, given recent events in Macao and the current situation inside China, it would be extremely unwise to make any reduction in the Garrison at themoment. The unofficial members of the Legislative Council, whohave recently agreed to a substantial increase in Hong Kong&apos;s denfence contribution, would also regard it as most inopportune. There isalso a question of the nature of the reduction, when it is made. ThisI am taking up separately with the Defence Secretary.European Economic Community29. The possibility chat we may start negotiations to enterEEC no longer arouses such strong emotional reactions in NewZealand and Australia as it did in 1961. In Singapore and Malaysialittle concern on this topic was expressed to me, though their governments will of course expect to be consulted.30. In New Zealand the attitude is now one of quiet relianceupon our undertakings to safeguard their essential interests and to consult their Government before we embark upon negotiations.Mr. Holyoake spoke to me in familiar terms of New Zealand being an extension of the British economy and of his confidence that britain would never accept membership of e.c. without asatisfactory arrangement for New Zealand. He stressed that apermanent solution, as distinct from mere transitional arrangements,would be vital for her. It appeared, however, that neither NewZealand Ministers nor officials had yet given much thought to thequestion exactly what arrangements we might seek on their behalf.31. To the Australian Cabinet I stressed that Australia^dependence upon the British market was much less than that of NewZealand, and implied that we should probably not be seeking anarrangement for her comparable with what we would be seeking for new Zealand. However, Mr. McEwen was difficult. He argued thata transitional period would not meet the needs of Australia, and that even if she were large enough to stand the knock of our entry in financial terms, she could not do so in human terms through standing by and seeing her sugar growers, butter producers and fruit farmersruined. He was also worried about the effect on Australia^ sterling
balances if it became necessary for sterling to cease being a reservecurrency. On this I hope I reassured him. Finally he argued that australia would be able to face the consequences of our entry intoEEC relatively easily if, with our backing, it had in themeantime been possible to secure satisfactory world commodityarrangements, e.g., on cereals, dairy produce, meat and sugar.32. Fiji&apos;s economy depends mainly upon the export of sugar,and would suffer grievous damage if we could not secure satisfactory arrangements in respect of sugar. The people of Fiji clearly regard it as unthinkable that we could let them down to this extent. the hong Kong economy would also be endangered, though to a lesser extent than either that of New Zealand or Fiji. Hong Kong hopeswe will try to secure &quot; association &quot; with the e.c. for her, butrealises that we would be very lucky to get it. Her real hope,therefore, lies in long transitional arrangements.33. I am convinced of the importance of thorough consultationwith the Governments particularly of New Zealand, Australia and hong Kong if we decide to start negotiations. It will not be enoughsimply to hold some quick and superficial discussions with them, andwe shall need to put forth our utmost efforts for New Zealand.Singapore and Malaysia have less need of safeguards. We shall haveto consider carefully the interests of the Governments of Fiji andof the other Commonwealth countries dependent upon sugar.Conclusion34. The most important general impression which I have brought back from this visit is of the substantial responsibilities,influence and respect which we still have in this area. It would be against our long-term interests to jettison these. We have a role toplay and interests of our own to sustain which, while changing fromthose of the historical past, are still of much significance both for ourselves and for the countries of the area.H.
