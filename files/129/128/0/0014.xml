MS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 14 COPY NO.1st February, 1967GDCABINETTHE FUTURE OF PRICES AND INCOMES policy memorandum by the Minister of labour in his paper (C(67) 13), the First Secretary of State proposes, inspeaking to the Trades Union Congress (TUC), to say (paragraph 34 (vii))that the Government has not yet taken a final decision as to the taking ofnew powers but that the decision will be influenced by the ability of the tuc and the Confederation of British Industries (CBI) to convince us that by their own efforts they can deal with the &quot;selfish minority&quot;.    Hegoes on to say that he does not think they can, and in that event heenvisaged (paragraph 35) that legislation giving new powers in place ofPart IV of the Prices and Incomes Act will be needed by August,2.       I think there would be serious objections to taking new powers in place of Part IV.3.       It is, I think, generally recognised that we must have the supportor at least the acquiescence of the TUC and the CBI in the next phase ofthe prices and incomes policy, if it is to succeed.    The TUC have already made it clear that they will not support a policy backed (even in the last resort) by legal powers of the kind in Part IV.    My own contacts with members of the tuc&apos;s General Council and with individual trade unionsleave me in no doubt that they are at the present time very much inearnest about this.4.       Since 20th July the policy has been remarkably successful.    Inmy view this is due to the support the standstill has had from the tuc and the CBI and, though there is not the same measure of agreement about the severe restraint period, in practice they are still largelyco-operating,    J  we lose that co-operation in the next phase the policycannot, in my view, survive.5.       The First Secretary of State envisages that if the TUC and CBIcannot convince us in detailed discussion that they can handle the&quot;selfish minority&quot;, legislation giving new powers would be introduced,presumably this Spring.    I myself think that the fair test would be tosee how in practice a voluntary policy actually works after the severe restraint period.    This means letting Part IV lapse without taking newpowers in its place, &quot;-1-
6.      Unless we give a voluntary policy a fair test in practice, weshall have against us, in the trade union movement, not only the unionshostile to the policy but even the moderate unions, on whom we havebeen able to rely hitherto.    And if they too become hostile, all thelegal powers in the world will not help us to preserve the policy.    Themost that in my view we could get moderate opinion to accept isactivation of Part II, possibly with some extension of the period of delay.7,      I do not dissent from the view of the First Secretary of State thatthe CBI and TUC are unlikely to be able to make a voluntary policy work.But we have to give them the chance.    The question is one of timing.If we do so, and the policy does fail, we shall be on very strong ground in seeking wider powers later on.    We shall almost certainly need to legislate after the Royal Commission has reported - perhaps in the1968-69 Session - and wider powers to support an incomes policy could conveniently, if need be, form part of that legislation,8.       It is very important that we should be clear where we stand onthis and make our position clear also to the TUC, before they hold theirConference of Executives on 2nd March,    It could greatly prejudice the outcome if that Conference took place in any uncertainty about theGovernment&apos;s future course of action.R, J o G.Ministry of Labour, S. W.l.1st February, 1967-2-
