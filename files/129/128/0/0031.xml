I have arranged to meet representativesof both organisations on Wednesday, 15th March, and will report their views to the Cabinet on the following day.    Subject to thoseviews, I suggest that we should regard the memorandum as the draftof a White Paper for issue on 21st or 22nd March.M. S.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.114th March, 1967
13th March, 13,6,7PRICES AND INCOMES,, POLICYX.    introduction the standstill on prices and Incomes;, followed by aperiod of severe restraint in the first half of 1967, was oneof the important measures taken in July last year designed tostrengthen the economy and to improve our competitive position.The very rapid increase in incomes compared with the increasein productivity in the previous eighteen months, despite thedevelopment of the agreed prices and incomes policy since theJoint Statement of Intent, had. contributed to the failure ofthe balance of payments to improve in the first half of 1966, andthe standstill and severe restraint were necessary to haltthe spiral of incomes and, prices.2,     The July measures have had considerable success.    exports have been advancing strongly and the rapid increase of importshas been checked.    The balance of payments has improvedconsiderably and was in surplus in the fourth quarter oflast year.    Sterling has been greatly strengthened and the gain to the reserves has made it possible to repay a satisfactoryamount of short-term debt.    Internally, the measures haveeliminated the excess pressure of demand and free resources for export production and other essential activity.- 1 -
3,     The success of the standstill and of the period of severe restraint so far has teen due largely to the voluntary accep-tance by management and unions and the public generally of thenational need for moderation and willingness to sacrificeimmediate personal benefit in the interests of the whole community.    Only in a relatively small number of cases has itteen necessary to make Orders under Part IV of the Prices and incomes Act, 1966, restricting particular prices or the pay ofparticular groups of workers.U,     In considering the-future development of the productivity,prices and incomes policy, the Govurnment have two mainobjectivess(i)    to ensure that economic recovery and. the prospects of sustained expansion are not jeopardised- by a renewedupsurge of incomes and prices after the end of severe restraint;(ii)    to work as quickly as possible, consistent with the considerations set out in (i), towards the operation ofthe policy on a voluntary basis in agreement particularly with C.B.I. and T.U.C.The Government have therefore welcomed the undertakings givenby the C.B.I. and T.U0G.  in their recent consultations withthese bodies to play their full part in the development of an effective voluntary policy.    It is common ground between themand the Government that decisions about prices and incomes should be related to the interests of the community as a whole.It is agreed also that there will be need for continued moderationespecially during the 12 months following June,  1967, in orderto provide a sound basis for the resumption of sustained economic growth.- 2 -
II.    PRICES AND CHARGES5     The continuing aim of the policy is to improve the competitive position of the economy and keep the general levelof prices stable.   More competitive prices will restrain thegrowth of imports and encourage the substantial increase in exports required to sustain faster economic growth. . But prices will not be competitive unless management continue their efforts to keep down costs and prices and actively reduce priceswherever possible.   A prices policy is required also to ensurethat profits are earned by efficiency and to maintain the real value of wages, salaries and other incomes, particularly smallfixed incomes, and thereby reduce the pressure for incomesincreases.   More immediately the aim must be to avoid any widespread and unjustifiable increase in prices due to pressureswhich may have been building up during the periods of stand still and severe restraint,6.    These considerations and the criteria set out below are intended to apply to all concerned including wholesalers and retailers in the determination of prices and charges in the private and public sectors alike in the twelve months after 30th June, 1967&apos;It would not be in the interests of economic efficiency to seek to operate the policy in a rigid form involving a very widespread and detailed supervision of individual prices and the aim will beto concentrate on those prices which are of economic significance,including those of importance in the cost of living.4^angements for Notification1&apos;    Within this context the early warning system for notification of proposed price increases is an essential element in the policy.Arrangements have been made during the standstill and severe restraint to strengthen and expand it.    The Government look to3
COM FIDE NTS AL31 Dall those concerned to continue to operate the existing early warning arrangements and they will also be reviewed/ing,  in consul-tation with the C.B.I. and other interested organisations, thepossible development of the early warning system in the lightof the experience gained during the last twelve months.    In thelight of this review,  it is the Governments intention that theexisting general request for advance notification of price increases made in para.9 of Cmnd.3073? should lapse on 30th June,1967.Price Reductions8.    The emphasis placed on restraining price increases must notdivert attention from the need for price reductions wherever possible.   Broad stability in the general price level requires that many more price reductions should be made to offset pricerises that cannot be avoided;    in particular prices in the manufacturing sector will need to fall in order to offset price increases in the rest of the economy where there is less scope forabsorbing increases in costs by increasing productivity.Appropriate cases involving the application of the criteria for price reductions will be referred to the N.B.P.I.Criteria for Price Behaviour9.    The limited criteria for price increases set out in para. 10of Cmnd.3150 will be replaced after 30th June, 1967, by the broadercriteria laid down in para. 9 of Part I of Cmnd.2639 which were agreed with Management and Unions.    Price increases should takePlace only where they can be fully justified against thesecriteria and every effort should be made to absorb increases in costs.   The criteria are:-(i)       if output per employee cannot be increasedsufficiently to allow wages and salaries to increase at^a rate consistent with the criteria for incomeswithout some increase in prices, and no offsettingredactions can be made in non-labour costs per unit of output or in the return sought on investment;I    - k -CONFIDENTIAL
(ii) if there are unavoidable increases in non-labour costs such as materials, fuel, services or marketingcosts per unit of output which con.net be offset by reductions in labour or capital costs per unit of out-put or in the return sought on investment;(iii) if there are unavoidable increases in capital costs per unit of output which cannot be offset by reductions in non-capital costs pier unit of output orin the return sought on investment;(iv) if, after every effort has been made to reducecosts, the enterprise is unable to secure the capitalrequired to meet home and overseas demand.10.   The agreed criteria for price reductions set out in para. 10of Part I of Cmnd.2639 which have applied during the severe restraint period will remain valid after 30th June, 1967-    Theseare that enterprises will be expected to reduce their prices in the following circumstances:(i) if output per employee is increasing faster thanthe rate of increase in wages and salaries which is consistent with the criteria for incomes,, and there arcno offsetting and unavoidable increases in non-labour costs per unit of output;(ii) if the costs of materials, fuel or services per unit of output arc falling and there are no offsettingand unavoidable increases in labour or capital costs per unit of output;(iii) if capital costs per unit of output are fallingand there are no offsetting end unavoidable increases in non-capital costs per unit of output;(iv) if profits are based on excessive market power.11.   It is not possible to apply directly the criteria for increases in prices or incomes to rents, but the principle ofmoderation should apply here also.     Moreover, the statutoryframework of the Rent Acts regulates the determination of rentsby landlords for virtually the whole of the private housing-sector and public sector housing, of course, is not conducted on a profit-making basis but is subsidised to an appreciable extent.
12.   The Government will continue to keep under review themovement of private housing rents as well as ensuring that the13.   With &quot;but a handful of exceptions local authorities havegiven full support to the standstill and severe restraint since20th July, 1966, within the limits imposed by their statutoryresponsibilities including the balancing of their housingaccounts year by year.      The Government recognize that many local authorities will need to review the level of their rents and some increases are likely to prove unavoidable, particularly if the rise in the level of rates is &quot;to be kept to the minimum.It is of great importance that where rent increases proveunavoidable local authorities should make the fullest use of rent rebates to protect tenants of modest means.1U.   In the case of rents for business premises mid land,  those concerned are expected to take into account the national needfor moderation in the negotiation of higher rents to be appliedduring the twelve months after June 1967.15.   The continuing objective of the incomes side of the policyis to develop effective arrangements for ensuring a closerrelationship between the overall growth of money incomes andthe growth of national output and to promote economic efficiency and social justice.      The immediate need after 30th June, 1967is to aroid a widespread and rapid increase in incomes in excessof the rise in national productivity resulting from the pressureswhich have built up during the periods of the standstill andsevere restraint,Employment Incomes16.   In the present economic situation priority must continue tobe given to economic recovery and the strengthening of theprovisions of the &quot;Rent Acts are properly observed.IV.  INCOMES- 6 -
CONFIDENTIALbalance of payments.     There can be no justification forreturning to the norm of 3-3%% per annum which prevailed up to july 1966, or, indeed, to any positive figure for the normwhich in practice becomes the minimum increase which everyoneexpects to receive.      Over the twelve months period beginning1st July,  1967? no-one can be entitled to such an increase;any increase (or other major improvement) will need to bejustified against the criteria set out below.      as stated in para.hO of the White Paper (Cmnd.3150), the country cannot atpresent afford any further general reduction in the standardworking week or general movement towards longer holidays.Proposed improvements in hours and holidays and other conditionsof service likely to add significantly to labour costs, as wellas pay increases of all types, will need to be &quot;justified inrelation to the criteria.These considerations and the criteria set out below are intended to apply to all concerned with the determination ofemployment incomes in the private and public sectors whether at industry or company level and including arbitrators,independent review bodies and statutory wage fixing bodies.Criteria - for incoiBBs, Behaviour17.   The limited criteria for incomes increases laid down inthe White Paper (Cmnd. 3150) will be replaced for the twelvemonths following 30th June, 1967, by the broader considerations of the White Paper (Cmnd. 2639) which were agreed with theC.B.I. and T.U.C.      These require that less regard should bepaid to such factors as general comparisons with incomes inother employment and changes in the cost of living and providefor increases in the following circumstances:-7 -
(i)    where the employees concerned, for example &quot;by accepting more exacting work or a manor change in working practices, make a direct contribution towardsincreasing productivity in the particular firm or industry.      Even in such cases some of the benefit should accrue to the community as a whole in theform of lower prices;(ii)    where it is essential in the national interest tosecure a change in the distribution of manpower (orto prevent a change which would otherwise take place)and a pay increase would be b-oth necessary and effective for this purpose;(iii) where there is general recognition that existingwage and salary levels are too low to maintain areasonable standard of living;(iv)   where there is widespread recognition that the pay ofa certain group of workers has fallen seriously outof line with the level of remuneration for similar work and needs in the national interest to be improved.Those criteria should also in the present situation be readin conjunction with the comments in paragraphs 18-21 below.The reports issued by the National Board for Prices and Incomesalso give valuable guidance on the interpretation and applicationof the criteria.18.   In their Report on Incomes Policy which was approved by theConference of Union Executives of 2nd March, 1967, the T.U.C.General Council stated that priority should continue to begiven to encouraging settlements which promote productivity and to improving the relative position of low-paid workers.The Government accept the desirability of maintaining thesepriorities within the overall objectives of the policy.      in applying the other two criteria it should be borne in mind bythe parties concerned that the most effective way of remedyinga labour shortage is to use existing manpower more efficiently and that comparisons should not be used to spread pay increases\&apos;v &apos;   ...    &apos;:   :. &apos; - .,77:&apos;; -. / \:.

CONFIDENTIAL ggj-ip;     The Government consider that in applying the criteriato proposed increases (or other improvements) under new agree-ments   two   additional considerations should he taken into&apos; account:(i)    those groups which have received increases underdeferred commitments or under the severe restraintcriteria or which are due for increases (or otherimprovements) under commitments which have escapeddeferment should wait at least twelve months afterthe operative date of the last increase &quot;beforereceiving further improvements under new agreements;(ii)    it would he against the national interest if theparties concerned were to seek to make good in subsequent negotiations increases foregone as aresult of the standstill and severe restraint.Notification of Claims and Proposed Settlements20.    The Government have welcomed the decision of the T.U.C. tostrengthen its own system for securing notification and vettingclaims and have expressed the hope that the C.B.I. would alsodevelop its efforts to give guidance to members on the applicationof the criteria to pay claims and offers.    Under the /&quot;early warning&quot; arrangements described in the White Paper (Cmnd. 2808)the Government receives information about claims and proposals to increase pay from the C.B.I, and T.U.C., from organisations which are not members of either of these bodies and directly from firms and employers&apos; organisations in the case of local and company negotiations.    These arrangements and the similar arrangements in the public sector will continue after 30th June,1967,21.    Information about claims and proposed settlements willcontinue to be required, whether at national, local or companylevel, in all cases covering 200 employees or more, and in other cases which are regarded as significant either because of thenature of the claim or because of the possible repercussions onthe pay of other groups.22.    As in the period of severe restraint,  it will be the aim off the Government in consultation with the C.B.I. and. T,U.C,and with the assistance of the parties and of the N.B.P.I. inappropriate cases, to secure the effective and consistentapplication of the incomes criteria both in the private and&quot;public sectors. pCONFIDENTIAL
23.   The criteria set out above are intended to apply as faras possible to salaries as well as to wages.    It is recognised,however, that many individual salaries and other forms of remuneration are fixed outside the normal process of collective bargaining and tend to be related more closely to individualcompanies1 needs and problems than are thes wages of manual workers and salaries of lower grades.    Increases in thesesalaries, like wage increases and increases in salaries generally,have been subject to the standstill and severe restraint,unless paid in the form of regular increments of specifiedamounts within a predetermined range or scale, as laid downin para,18(iv) of the White Paper (Cmnd.3073).2h.   After 30th June, 1967 managements will be free to returnto the normal progression within salary scales or ranges.    Itis important that there should be a proper development of salary structures which provide incentives to improvedperformance.   But any general increase in salary ranges oraverage salary levels will need to be justified by the criteria.Self-employment incomes25 .   Although the incomes criteria do not apply precisely tothe circumstances of self-employed persons,  the fees, charges and incomes of such persons should be subject to the samemoderation as wages and salaries.    In some cases it will bemore appropriate to apply prices criteria.
Pr ofits and Dividends260   The Government5 s call for a standstill on increases in company distributions during the twelve months ofstandstill and severe restraint has been given full supportby industry and commerce.   Although this standstillwill end in July 1967, companies should exercise moderationin distributions during the following year consistently with the principles of this White paper.    The Governmenthave power under section 12 of the Prices and incomes act to require notice to be given of company distributions.27.   As set out in paragraph 17 of the White Paper 011Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd. 2639) which was agreed between the Government, management and unions, theGovernment will use their fiscal powers or other appropriate means to correct any excessive growth in aggregate profits, whether distributed or not, as comparedwith the growth of total wages and salaries, after allowing for short-term fluctuations.28,   The Government will stand ready also to refer for examination by the National Board for Prices and Incomes pricescases where the growth of profits or dividends is basedon excessive market power.-11.7-
I   KaTIOI^^OARD-^R--P^ICES-.Jl\ND INCOMES29,   The work of the National Board for Prices and Incomes hasthe beginning of the standstill; the.Board has in the sameexpected that the parties concerned in all these referenceswould find themselves in entire agreement with the Board&apos;srecommendations, &quot;but there has been widespread recognition ofthe great value of the Board&apos;s reports and of its role as anindependent statutory body in furthering the objectives of the productivity, prices and incomes policy.    The Board.&apos;s workwill continue to he of great importance.    The power to requireunder Part II of the Act the deferment for a period ofimplementation of proposed price or pay increases is governed by the process of referring these for examination by theBoard.30.   In consultation with the Confederation of British Industryand the Trades Union Congress and other interested bodies, theGovernment intend to continue to refer to the Board bothappropriate cases relating to the application of the abovecriteria for prices and incomes and matters of longer termimportance in the field of productivity, prices and incomes.31 .   The Government have made clear that it is their firmintention to give every encouragement to the voluntaryoperation of prices and incomes policy, and attach greatimportance to the roles of the C.B.I. and T.U.C.  in this context.   Part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act will lapseon 11th August,.1967ogrown and there have been  period completed /VI THE POLICY AND RESERVE POWERS-12-CONFIDENTJAL
9&quot;532.   The C.B.I. and T.U.C. have urged that after the end ofthe period of severe restraint there should he full reliance on a voluntary operation of the policy without either activationof part II or the enactment of further reserve powers.    Fortheir part, the Government fully accept that the availability of limited reserve powers cannot be a substitute for the voluntary co-operation of the majority of those concerned inthe determination of prices and incomes.    However experienceof the standstill and severe restraint has shown the importanceof having some limited reserve powers available.33.   Accordingly, the Government intend to propose the activa-tion of Part II before Part IV lapses in accordance with theprocedure laid down in section 6 of the Act, including prior consulation with the C.B.I. and T .U.C.    The Government willbe consulting further with the C.B.I. and T.U.C. about a united development cf the reserve powers over prices and incomes under the Prices and Incomes Act.
