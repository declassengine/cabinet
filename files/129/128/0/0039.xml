^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 3931st March, 1967CABINETTHE FUTURE OF PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY;STATUTORY powers memorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic affairs with the publication on 22nd March of the White Paper on prices and Incomes Policy After 30th June, 1967 (Cmnd. 3235), it remains forthe Cabinet to reach conclusions about the question of further statutory powers.    I have told Parliament that a decision is expected  soon afterthe Easter Recess.2.     We are pledged to further consultation with the Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI) and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on thebasis of the reserve powers described in paragraphs 8-14 of C(67) 20.There is no serious problem with the CBIs they have brought themselvesto accept legislation on these lines if it is limited to the twelve monthsafter 30th June, 1967.    The position with the TUC is unchanged sincethe Cabinet^ discussion on 16th March (CC(67) 13th Conclusions,Minute 6); they oppose activation of Part II and the taking of any additional powers.3.      I need not rehearse all the reasons why I consider it necessaryfor us to seek the reserve powers described in C(67) 20 - 1 attach asummary of these powers.     The expected trend of overall demand shouldcontinue to exercise some braking effect on the general level of claims and settlements, but current claims and settlements do not suggest thatwe can count with confidence on voluntary co-operation alone without thesupport of reserve powers.    My colleagues will have in mind also theoutlook as described in Annex C of C(67) 16.     Nor do I think it would be wise in 1967-68 to try to operate on the prices side without something more effective than the present Part II.4.     As mentioned in paragraph 9 of C(67) 20, these reserve powers would not in practice be as wide as they seem.    Anything less than this might well damage seriously the credibility of our policy, particularlyin the United States of American and the European Economic community countries.5,     Apart from the tuc&apos;s general attitude to powers, the main fearabout reserve powers at home has been that we might try to bring insomething like Part IV but we have rejected this idea.    The public havebeen expecting us to retain powers which v/ould at least enable us to check the &quot;rogue elephants&quot; whether on prices or pay.    The prolongeddiscussion and uncertainty about powers may be beginning to sap the fund of the public goodwill for our efforts to get away from a free for all.COPY NO.-1-S.ECRET
6.     Any fresh legislation on prices and incomes is going to be attacked by some sections of opinion and it would seem wiser in ourlonger  term interests to incur such odium for the sake of real reserve powers than for such limited powers that we would not be able to administer any effective check to those who try to get away with it andignore the need for moderation.7.      It will in any case be necessary, if the benefits achieved since20th July are not to be lost through a spate of successful actions for breach of contract in respect of pay increases deferred in accordancewith Government policy, to introduce a new provision protectingemployers from such actions designed to &quot;wipe the slate clean&quot; for theperiod up to 30th June, 1967.8.      I recommend, therefore, that we should seek the powerssummarised in the Annex below.    If the Cabinet accept this recommendation, I would propose to inform the TUC that this was our intentionunless they had any specific suggestions for modifying the &quot;package&quot;.It is unlikely that the TUC themselves would make specific suggestionsthough they might then ask for a meeting with the Prime minister before the Government announced their decision to Parliament,,    As thePrime Minister explained to the Cabinet on 16th March, it might in anycase be appropriate for him to see the TUC  before promulgating theGovernment5s decisions about powers.M. S.Department of Economic Affairs, S. W. 1,30th March, 1967
FURTHER STATUTORY POWERS i   SUMMARYPowers to be taken for twelve months only with no built-in power to renew them so that a fresh Bill would have to be introducedif we subsequently thought it right to retain all or some of the powers.No pledge to be given that the Government would not seek such legislation in 1968.2.     These v/ould be limited powers to enable the Government, attheir own discretion, to implement recommendations of theNational Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) in the followingrespects;-(i) Extension of the standstill on a price or pay increasebeyond the three or four months under Part II whichis the period provided to allow the Board to prepareits report.(ii)      Prevention of retrospective payment of a pay increasein respect of a standstill period.(iii)      Reduction of prices.In addition there would be a further power to secure a temporaryreversion of any increase in prices or pay which has already occurredbut which merits examination by the NB PI.Amendment of Section 30 of the Prices and Incomes Act.   Itwill in any case be necessary to introduce a new provision to remove the cause of actions for breach of contract in cases in v/hich pay increases have been deferred during the period of standstill and severe restraint in accordance with the Governments request.-3-
