I shall submit my comments on this report to the Cabinet as soonas possible together with an up-dated review of the projects costestimates.     My officials are pressing on with this work as a matterof urgency but it is unlikely that I will be able to put forward myconsidered views before the beginning of March.

- 1 &quot;REPORT OF THE CONCORD ECONOMIC PROSPECTS COMMIT!EE1.   . We were appointed as the result of an exchange of notes betweenthe British and French Governments in August and September.  1966, andrequired to &quot;assess the economic and commercial prospects of the concord project.&quot;     A list of the members of our Committee is at annex A.2.     We have held six meetings.     We have supplemented studiesalready done by experts that bear on the economic and commercial prospects of Concord with fresh information aimed at establishingboth the areas in which errors of estimation are most likely and the likely margins of these errors.     In addition to the information which we have had from officials, we have received information fromthe manufacturers of Concord and from Air France and E.0.A C.:    thisis summarised in Annex B.     We have thus estimated the probable size of the potential market for Concord and the limits within which itshould lie.     We have then considered the extent to which sales maymatch the potential market and the return on investment (includingresearch and development).The likelihood of technical success within the planned timescale.3.     Although Concord is intended to achieve the biggest singleleap forward.ever made in airliner operating speed, it is being built by advanced but well-proven manufacturing techniques and mainly of conventional materials.     While its design embodies many novelfeatures, they are not revolutionary.     These factors encourage us tobelieve that those responsible have a reasonable chance of achievingwhat they plan to achieve in terms of performance and timescale.But in such a field there must also be risks of unexpecteddifficulties and delays.American and Russian competition.If.     Our American competitors, on the other hand, have made a laterstart and are setting themselves more difficult objectives (see annex.).     Although American capabilities must not be underrated, we thinkit rather more likely than not that the Americans will eventually be obliged either to aim at an even later date than at present planned for the introduction of their aircraft or to aim at lower standards of performance for the aircraft when first introduced than thosehitherto contemplated.     Recent information regarding both.the Boeingand Lockheed proposals Indicates that the aircraft proposed will be unable in certain conditions to take off with full payload, will haveoperating costs higher than those previously envisaged, and have a shorter range than Concord.     It also appears that airport noisepresents greater problems than for Concord.     Nevertheless, the airlines which have participated in the evaluation of these proposalsbelieve that the designs now offered will be improved. .   In any case,the U.S. S.S.T. programme will undoubtedly bear on the prospects of concord at many points.5.     From what is known of the Russian S.S.T.  (the Tupolev 144 ) itappears to be very similar indeed in conception to Concord.     Butdespite their impressive achievements in other areas of aerospacetechnology, the Russians have hitherto been relatively ineffectivecompetitors in the field of civil airliners. &apos;  While therefore wehave little hard information on which to base a judgement, we havethe impression that the Russians would have to make an exceptional/technical
technical and commercial effort to render their S.S.T, a seriouscompetitor with Concord.Sums,advanced for development.6.     The estimates of the officials concerned with the development of concord indicate that it will cost (at January 1966 prices) about 370 M  (5100MF) up to the standard of initial certification ofair-worthiness (planned for 1971) , plus a further  80M   (IIOOMF) to achieve full performance with stage 1 engines (planned for 1973).To this total of  450M  (6200MF), the officials have added a globalcontingency of  50M  (700MF), making a grand total of  500M(7000MF).Of this total, about  140M (2000MF) has been contractually committed.We have noted that these estimates, even without the global contingencare in excess of the contractors&apos; estimates.     Nevertheless, on thebasis of the estimates themselves, some 1&apos;0%  of the development workremains to be done, so that there is still room for a considerablemargin of error in estimating total cost.     Previous estimates inmany countries relating to large technical projects - aeronauticaland otherwise - have often proved to have been too low despite thebest efforts of those concerned.     Although one must be careful inmaking deductions from military experience, it is noteworthy that a study by the U.S. Department of Defence indicated that the ratio ofactual costs to originally estimated costs for twenty major weaponsystems averaged 3-2 to 1, whilst the ratio between the actual timeto completion and the originally estimated tine averaged 1.36 to 1,The estimates for Concord have, however, already escalated from anoriginal figure of  135 M  (1865MB1).  . Nevertheless, although weconsider the estimate of  500M  (7000MP) to be the best available, wemust draw attention to the possibility that even now it may be too low and that an increase of, say, 10 to 20% may not be out of thequestion.     We also draw attention to the fact that any substantial increase in costs above those estimated implies also a failure to achieve the estimated timetable for development, and that if this were to occur without there being a corresponding setback to theU.S. S,S.T. the prospects of Concord- would be thereby diminished.The manufacturers have not yet agreed to accept incentive contracts in the form proposed to them.     A commitment by the manufacturers inthis matter would be likely to diminish our doubts on the validity ofthe estimates.     It would   moreover   have the advantage of reducingthe risks of the estimates being exceeded.Sums advanced for production.7.      It makes no sense to develop Concord.., unless it is to be producedfor sale in quantity to the world&apos;s airlines.      In addition to the 500M  (7000MF) required for development, further large sums willhave to be found for production, before receipts from sales begin torise faster than expenditure on production.     It is likely that a.substantial proportion of these sums will have either to be providedby the two Governments or covered by guarantees from them againstloss.     Moreover, a large part of this investment will have to be incurred in advance of firm orders from airlines.     It is estimatedthat this net investment by the two countries in production (thedifference between total investment in production and receipts fromsales) will reach a maximum of  150-220 M  (2000-3000MF) in theperiod from 1971 to 1973.^ .c2X2ry 0S,. sums advanced fpj^j^roduotj-on^8,     The risks of a loss on production alone are by no moansnegligible.     The experts estimate that, with no levy for research and development, the average unit cost of production for a run of 100/aircraft
- 3 -aircraft at a rate of 3 a month will he about  6.5M (90MP) per air-craft, but this contains a considerable margin of uncertainty and itis as likely - probably more likely - to be too low rather than too high.     A more serious ground for anxiety is lest the number of aircraft over which the costs have to be averaged (i e   the number of aircraft assumed to be sold.) be misjudged.     In the event of a failure to sell aircraft in the numbers envisaged when the production was planned, the losses could, on certain assumptions defined in Annex D,rise to  100-130M  (1A00-1800MF).9.     Another risk is that of a severe technical setback at the time that large sums have been committed to production.     A disastercomparable to the Comet disaster could face the two countries with a loss of a sum even greater than the net investment in production of 150-220 M (2000-3000MP) quoted in paragraph 7 above.     In such an event, there would be inescapable commitments beyond the moneyactually paid on production and receipts would obviously be affectedso that the total loss on production might &quot;be as much as - 50 % higherthan the  150-220 M  (2000-3000MF) quoted.     We have no reason tobelieve that such a disaster is at all likely, but think it right topoint out the magnitude of the suns at risk if it were to occur.&apos;10.   Taking everything into account,, the most crucial factor in the assessment is the number of aircraft likely to be sold.     although this obviously depends partly on the price at which they are offered,we think It useful to consider first what the demand is likely to beat prices which are little more than those required to cover the costs of production.     (We consider in paragraph 27 how elasticdemand might be in response to higher prices intended to bring in abetter return on the investment).Factors affecting th^demarid for Concord.11.   The demand for Concord will be affected ty a large number of factors, many of which are interacting variables.     Some of themcannot be assessed at all accurately for several years, and some are more a matter for political, sociological or psychological judgementthan for technical or economic evaluation,      There have been manystudies of the possible demand for S.S.T.S in general and for various types of S.S.T. in particular      The results of the most noteworthyare summarised in Annex E.     None of them, however, can be betterthan the assumptions on which they are based, which in turn are dependent on fallible human judgements.     Within the limits of thetime and resources available to us, vie have attempted to cover theground again.     Our views on the effect of the more important factors. are given in the following paragraphs.Operating costs.12.    Concord will cost an airline more to operate per seat-mile thansubsonic jet airliners.     V/e think its cost per seat-mile will be some 30% higher than those of the current generation of long-range-jets of which the Boeing 707 may be taken as the examplar, and some+0% higher than those of the-Boeing 747 (the so-called &apos;jumbo-jet&apos;)which is expected, to come into service at about the same time asConcord.     This means that allowing for the fact that Concord, will carry less freight, its operating cost per sea.t-mile will be about1+0%  above that of the average subsonic aircraft in service at thesame time.     The background, to this assessment is given in Annex F.It will be seen from Annex B that the sea.t-m.ile costs produced byB.A..C. and Sud Aviation are somewhat more favourable to Concord thanours, and those of Air France similar to ours.     Supporters of theU. S. S.S.T. have claimed that it will achieve operating costs similarto those of subsonic aircraft.     However, having regard to the poorCONFIDENTIAL /performance
- if. -performance offered by the latest Boeing and Lockheed S.S.T. proposals and having regard to the studies summerised in Annex C, it seems unlikely that either the Boeing or the Lockheed design could achievesuch operating costs by 1975 which has hitherto been given as the date for their introduction.     Indeed, on the basis of present knowledge,&apos;there is reason to doubt whether any S.S.T. will ever have operating costs as low as the best of subsonic aircraft.     The U.S. S.S.T. thusdoes not appear to be such a formidable competitor as it was at oncethought to be, and the chance of maintaining a fare differentialbetween S.S.I.S and subsonic aircraft (see paragraph 14 below) now appears better than was once expected.13-    Given that Concord will have higher costs per seat-mile than sub-sonic aircraft, then if airlines are to buy It they must be convincedthat they can offset this disadvantage either by filling a higher pro-portion of its seats, or by charging a higher fare for each seat, orby a combination of both.Fares.14.   Fares are normally agreed multilaterally by the airlines whichmeet periodically under the aegis of the International Air TransportAssociation (l.A T.A. ) .     We are advised that the long-term trend towards fare reductions in real terms is likely to continue, and that,by the time Concord Is coming into service, fares may be at least 10$lower than they are now.     In the early years pressure among airlinesfor higher fares to be charged for S. S.T. s may be expected, to come atleast as much from those &quot;who wish to preserve their subsonic aircraft from the loss of passengers to the S.S.T.s, as from those who wish toensure that the S.S.T.S can be operated profitably.     The resolution of the various conflicting interests cannot be expected to be achieved in the form of an I.A.T.A. agreement before September, 1970-     the indications are that a fare differential Of about 15/2   will prove tobe generally acceptable, and it is possible that if the whole of theaccomodation offered by the S.S.T.S were to be treated as a special&quot;speed class&quot; (instead of as a mixture of first and tourist class, aswith present-day aircraft), then a differential over the subsonictourist fare of 20-25$ might prove acceptable.     If the TJ. S. S. S.T.were later to achieve operating costs very close to those of subsonicaircraft, then there would be pressure for a reduction or even for theabolition of the fare differential.     But as we have indicated inparagraph 12, this may not happen for a long time, if at all.15-   The proportion of seats filled, or 1 load factor&apos; is obviously aninteracting variable with the fares charged.     But we think thatConcord, should, particularly in its early years when relatively feware in service and it has no American S.S.T. competitor, be able to operate with a high load, factor.     Speed is the only major attractionover other forms of transport which air travel offers, and if speedwere the only variable most passengers would probably choose to travelby the fastest available aircraft.*:    &quot;When compared with a subsonic^^^^__^^A^-,    M,^yiii   GtL-,Studies have been made of the value which users of surface transport and medium range air transport place on savings in time.   Their simpleextrapolation would lead, to the conclusion that passengers would notbe willing to pay the surcharge envisaged for this aircraft.   But suchan extrapolation would not take into account factors peculiar toConcord, such as the attraction of novelty and the fact that, by thetime it comes into service, incomes will be considerably higher.    Itseems, therefore, that it would be in the interests of the manufact-manufacturers and the airlines to give: further consideration to this matter.
--&apos;5 -aircraft, Concord saves over three hours on a translantic crossing,i.e. it cits the total journey time by about a half.     (it may benoted that although the American S.S.T. is planned to fly at aboutMach 2.7 compared with Concord&apos;s Mach 2.2 this would save only afurther 20 minutes or so on a translantic journey rney).     It has beensuggested also that the layout of Concord (four seats abreast with a centre aisle) may have a higher passenger appeal than the layout ofthe larger subsonic jets or of the large American S.S.T.     Furthermorean aircraft carrying about 130 passengers (Concord) tends to make for more flexible scheduling than one carrying two to four times that number.     A large proportion of Concord traffic will be businesstraffic which does not vary much throughout the year.     For these various reasons   we think the claims that Concord will achieve a highload factor are well-founded.     We believe It could well be over 10%in its early years, and will, average about 65$  over a ten year life,as compared with about 52.5 % for subsonic aircraft.     As more S.S.T.Scome into service, it may fall away later, but this tendency may bepartly offset by Concord being transferred to routes of lower trafficdensity where its smaller size would be an advantage.Engine noise and sonic bang.16.   The operation of Concord, like that of existing jet airliners,will give rise to the familiar problems of engine noise on and aroundairports.     It is being designed to keep within the noise levels atpresent tolerated by most airport authorities, but there are grounds for anxiety in that new regulations are contemplated which Concord(along with the U.S. S.S.T.S and the jumbo-jets) might have difficultyin meeting.     It is therefore important that current studies of ways of reducing the noise of Concord&apos;s engines should be pursued.     It isnot certain that the introduction of an Improved silencer will be entirely adequate:    if it Is not, then there is a danger that costlyrestrictions will be imposed on the operation of the aircraft.17.   Vvhile engine noise is a familiar problem, common to subs onic air-liners and to S.S.T.S, with the sonic bang problem we are on much lessfamiliar ground, and one which is peculiar to the supersonic aircraft.There can be no doubt that: completely unrestricted operation overlandby S.S.T.S in regular airline service would create a nuisance whichfew communities would tolerate, so that some restriction is inevitable,The problem is to judge how much restriction there is likely to be,and what will be its effect.18.   We have attempted an assessment of the effects of variousdegrees of sonic bang restrictions, and the results are included, in annex F.     We conclude that if supersonic flight were permitted onlyover the sea and any associated subsonic stages over land &quot;were short,then the traffic for which Concord might compete would be only some55-60$  of what it would be if there were no restrictions.     Ifsupersonic flight were permitted over sparsely-populated areas andcoupled with longer subsonic stages where necessary, then the trafficfor which Concord might compete would be about 75$  of what it wouldbe if there were no restrictions.     This latter value of 75% may beconsidered to reflect the most realistic case, which is that des-crlbed below as &quot;partial sonic bang restriction&quot;.     It may be notedthat orders from American airlines, mostly for operation on inter-national routes, are of great importance to the success of Concord(see paragraph 23) and that, however objective the U.S. authorities may seek to be, an   element of national self-interest will inevitablyintrude into their attitud.e towards the operation of Concord from u.S. airports or over U.S. territory.     On the one hand., they may seeConcord as a useful forerunner for their own S.S.T.;    on the other,they nay be tempted to take a long while to make up their minds/about
CONFIDENTIAL- 6 -about restrictions on its use so as to reduce the advantages of itslead in time over the U.S. aircraft.19.    Broadly, our assessment indicates that traffic on routes suitablefor Concord will be about 3? times its 19^4 level in 1975, and about5i times this level in 1980.     The background to this assessment is in annex F.Estimate of the demandjfor Concordu20.   We have attempted Jjo assess the effect of all the above factorson the potential market for Concord and on the numbers that might be sold.     The detailed calculations are set out in Annex F.     Ourcentral estimate of the potential market up to 1975, on the assumptionthat there will be partial sonic bang restrictions (see paragraph l8above), is as follows.Central Estimate of the Potential Market for Concord. 1975-:          Operators	:  North I American	Other j Operators	Total-) Routes       ^\	I J		1 North Atlantic f and Pacific	j 45 1	!    53	. 98I        Other jl        Routes	1 20		64 .Total	t 1    65	i &quot;\       97	16221.   Even if Concord is available by the date, with the performance,and at the price now envisaged, it is not likely that this potentialmarket of 162 aircraft will be matched by actual sales.     Airlines willbe cautious in committing themselves;    for the following reasons:(a) The prospect that within a few years the larger U.S. S.S.T.will become available, possibly with lower costs per seat-mile .(b) Consequential doubts about the prospects of retaining theadvantages of the surcharge and load factor over the wholelife of the aircraft and hence of making a satisfactoryreturn,, on the heavy investment involved.(c) Pressures of various kinds may be exerted by the U.S.Government and private U.S. interests to protect themarket for the U.S. S.S.T.(d) Doubts about the amount of engine noise and sonic bangwhich the authorities in various countries will tolerate.22.    Some of the airlines&apos; possible reason for caution in buyingConcord would be removed if the threat of competition from the U.S.S.S.T. became less serious - i.e., if its dato of entry into service the estimate of the potential market is based on the assumptionthat Concord will carry all the traffic for which it is suited.
&apos; - 7 -were set back or its performance or cost were seen to be considerablyworse than they are planned to be now.     Conversely, any delay in the concord that led to a reduction in its lead time over the 11. S. S.S.T.would reduce the market for Concord.,.     In our detailed calculations,we have not taken either of these eventualities into account.23&apos;    In the light of the foregoing considerations,&apos; we would suggestthat a reasonable central estimate of sales up to 1975 would be about130 Concords as compared, with a potential market of 162.     Thisassumes that about 50 would be purchased by American operators, whichindicates the importance of the -American market for the success of concord.21+.   However, this figure of 130 Concords by 1975 is the centre of a wide range, even on the specific assumptions which we have taken.We have tried to analyse the uncertainties in each of our estimates and to work out the resultant uncertainty in the total on theassumption that the errors are independent of one another.     This hasled to a possible range of from 100 to 220 Concords for the potentialmarket up to 1975 and of from 80 to 180 Concords for sales up to 1975-?/*e wish to emphasise that these are mathematica.1 calculations givingthe 30%  chance that the Actual figure will be-within these limits.In practice, as some of the variables may be related, and as successbreeds success and failure failure, there is perhaps a higher chance that the figure will be either relatively small or relatively largethan that it will be a figure somewhere near the middle of the range.This last consideration, coupled with the breadth of uncertainty,indicates that the project is a gamble.25.    Predictions of the market for S.S.T.S in the period 1976-198O(on similar assumptions to those used for the estimates given inparagraph 20 above-   including a surcharge of ^3%&quot;) suggest a demandfor 80 aircraft of Concord size, or about 30 U.S. S.S.T.S, on whichbasis a U.S,  S. S,T,. would hardly be viable in this period.     this estimate also Is highly uncertain and has a wide range of possibleerror.     Moreover, in view of the competition from the. U.S. S.S.T.,the proportion that will actually be Concords is even more uncertain,as this will d.epend on the relative performance and economics of thetwo aircraft, taking account of any developments there may be toConcord.     Thus after 1975 (and to a lesser extent before) the sales of Oonoord will be crucially dependent upon the nature and timing ofthe competition from the TJ.S.  S.S.T.26.   The traffic and market estimates (see Annex F) indicate that bythe late 1970s, given the large size of aircraft which will then beavailable, it would be most difficult to accommodate profitably allthe types of long-haul aircraft at present under development orconsideration - Concord, the U.S.. S.S.T., the Boeing 747 and possibly the Lockheed C5A and other jumbo-jets.     This suggest that a highlycompetitive&apos; situation may exist and that one or more of the types of aircraft will-have to drop out or will be a commercial failure.     Itis likely that this situation will induce U.E. firms to .define anS.S.T. for-which the fare surcharge would be low or non-existant, andin this event the market for such an S.S.T. would be much greater.Elasticity of demand for Cencord.27.   The capital cost of Concords accounts for about one-third of thetotal operating costs per seat-mile.     It is therefore tempting to conclude that the demand from the airlines for the aircraft will be relatively inelastic and. that provided, that Concord is reasonablysuccessful it should be possible to exploit that success forcefullyby adding to the cost of producing it a substantial levy towards the/recovery
recovery of the costs of development.     But we think this would be a false conclusion.     Experience sho:vs that aircraft manufacturers haveto quote keen prices in order to sell their products, and we do notthink it reasonable to assume that Concord can be made to bea.r muchmore than the sliding scale of 1+fo  to 10%  levy which Is at presentenvisaged.     This view is reinforced by the arguments in paragraphs 18to 21 above.     For similar reasons we think it important to keepproduction costs down.     On the other hand, we think that if ConcordIs relatively unsuccessful technically and proves unattractive tooperators, demand would prove extremeiy inelastic to reductions in price even to well below the costs of production.     A matter which thetwo Governments will need to consider eventually is whether theyshould aim wholeheartedly at maximising the return on their investment(which might involve selling a smaller number of aircraft at a high price) or move some way towards a policy of maximising the number sold,even at some reduction in the total return on the investment.     firm decisions on this point cannot be reached until the shape of thedemand curve can be more accurately assessed, and this will not befor some years.^ JiPr&quot;--?:P- tiiisLLJ!1^!^.. JL4YJHl e5L&quot;28.    As a broad illustration of the problem of recovery of development expenditure, it may be noted that if 130 Concords were sold at a basic price of  6.5M (QOMF) each needed, to recover production expenditure,then the levy on top of this basic price would have to be about  2 M(27.5MF) per aircraft if the whole of the  500M  (7000MF)  spent on development were to be recovered.     (This calculation is on theassumption that sales of spares would eventually amount to about 85 %of the value of sales of aircraft and could be made to bear half ofthe recovery through a somewhat higher rate of levy).     If the levywere required to recover the  500M  (7000MF) plus interest on thisinvestment over the long period involved., then it would have to beabout twice as high - say    AM   (55MB1) per aircraft.     We think itinconceivable that the market could bear a levy of this magnitude.29.    On the basis of our central estimate of sales of 130 Concords by1975, and a levy starting at k-%  and rising to 10%  (the formula sofar adopted by the officials responsible for the project) the levyincluding that on spares would produce about  130M (1800MP).     this may be set against development costs estimated at  500M  (7000JS?),or about double that amount if allowance is made for interest on thesum over the decade or so which elapses before recoveries are made.However, the financial assessment of the..,project, though essential, isnot the only aspect relevant to an economic judgement on it.     two other major considerations are its effect on the aircraft industries of the two countries and. on their balances of payments.30.    work on Concord at present sustains the equivalent of about10,000 full-time jobs in each country:    this represents about i+%  oftotal employment in the British aircraft industry (250,000) and. about10% of the French aircraft industry (100,000).     In full production at a rate of 3 a month in the 1970s it would sustain about 30 000 jobs in each country (about 15&apos;f? of the present strength of the Britishindustry and about 30% of the French).     It is the only long-haulcivil project which Is in prospect for the industries of the twocountries that affords an alternative to complete dependence onAmerica.     Failure to complete the Concord project would be bound toreact adversely on progress in advanced aircraft technology and on theretention of the design teams.     It is nevertheless desirable that theemployment of these scarce and valuable resources in the aircraft industries should, provide direct and indirect benefits broadlycommensurate with their value.
]        - 9 -   &apos;31 .    It is also necessary to take into account the fact that -sales ofthe aircraft will either earn foreign exchange (in the case of thirdcountry buyers) or save foreign exchange (in the case of B.O.A.C. andAir France who would other wise have to purchase from abroad).     Theextent of the benefit to the balance of payments will of coursedepend on the numbers, and price, of Concords actually sold.Assuming a pi-oduction cost of about  6.5M (90MF) each for 130 aircraft,plus spares in due course to about 85%  of the value of the aircraft,then sales might bring in about  1,580M  (22,O00MF) to which may beadded  130M  (iSOOMp) for levy (see paragraph 29), making a total ofabout  1,700M (23,500MF).     The import content of this productionmight amount to about 5%  to 10% .     In assessing the weight to begiven to this benefit it should be borne in mind that large resourceswill have been invested in the project, including some  500M(7000MF)of public funds on development of which the major part Is.unlikely tobe recouped;    and that these resources, if used for other purposes,might have had. some export-earning or import-saving potential.     Inaddition, a substantial proportion of the foreign exchange earnings from overseas sales may well be delayed until the late 1970s becauseof the provision of export credit.Summary and conclusions.32.   Although the best possible estimates have been made of develop-ment costs and large contingencies included, there is a risk,inevitable with such a technically advanced project, that Concord maynot be completed on time (in service in 1971) or within the estimateddevelopment expenditure  500M   (7000MF).33.    In addition to the development expenditure, some  150-220M(20OO-3000MF), probably covered in great part by aid from the State,will have to be invested in production.     This investment is exposed to substantial risks, and even more might be lost if there were a major technical setback.34.   The expected costs   performance   and date of introduction of theU.S.  supersonic transport (U,S. S.S.T.) are of crucial importance inthe assessment of the commercial prospects of Concord.     If the U.S.S.S.T. programme achieves its present objectives (including entry into service in 1974/75) it may not only capture the greater part of thetotal S.S.T. market after 1975, but also affect the sales of Concordbefore that date.     Present evidence suggests that the date and performance objectives of the U.S. S.S.T. will not both be met, but itwould be optimistic to assume that the Americans will not be able to overcome at least some of the difficulties now foreseen.35.    If Concord enters service later than now planned, the gap beforethe U.S. S.S.T.  comes into service may be shortened and the market for Concord thus reduced. :36.    we do not consider Russian competition to be a likely threat,because of their poor commercial performance in selling aircraft.37.   Engine noise in and around airports is still a cause for concern, as it may be difficult to reduce it to the level required byfuture noise regulations, thus limiting Concord&apos;s use.     The develop-rcent programme designed to reduce the noise is important and shouldbe pursued vigcrously.-38.   Much more important, the sonic bang will restrict the market.Vie have estimated that restriction of supersonic flight to sparsely-populated territory (the most likely restriction) would reduce themarket to about 75%  of what it might be if there were no sonic bang/restrictions
restrictions at all.   A&quot; complete ban on supersonic flight over land would reduce the market to 55%-60%-39.   Concord&apos;s operating- cost per seat-mile is estimated to be aboutmore than that of the average subsonic jet which will be operating at the same time.     It should be possible to offset this bya fare surcharge of about \3%  and a higher lead factor (proportion of seats filled) averaging &amp;5% over Concord&apos;s life (compared with52.5%  for the subsonic jets).40.   Our own central estimate of the sales of Concord is 130 up to 1975(of which about 50 would be purchased by North American operators).But our calculations shew a probable range of 80 to 180 (i.e., only a50%  chance that actual sales will be within this range).     This means that .any assessment made today is merely an assessment of probabilitiesand that the project is of necessity a gamble, depending not only onour ability to develop a technically satisfactory aircraft, but also on factors beyond our control.41.   The total market for S,S.T.s between 19?6 and 1980 might be equivalent to about 80 Concords, but the number of Concords sold will depend on the relative economics of Concord and the U.S. S.S.T.     Itwould not be safe to rely on a largo volume of sales of Concord inthis period.42.    Important decisions will need to be made soon regarding the monthly rate of production and the time by which this rate is to beachieved.     A balance has to be struck between starting too early(which would entail costly mod if modifications i ons to the aircraft d.uring or after production in the light of experience gained in development) anddelaying the start (which wrould entail a higher monthly rateconcentrated over a shorter period if the market were still to becaught, and which would be expensive).     We feel, however, that what-ever the precise timing, production should be on a scale adequate tomeet the expected market by 1975-43-   It will be necessary in due course for the two Governments todecide on the policy to be adopted with regard to the levy.     Thiswill depend on whether they wish to maximise the financial return ontheir investment, or rather to maximise the number of aircraft sold.44.    In financial terms, the prospect of any positive return on thetotal investment in development and production appears remote, and alarge less likely.     It Is doubtful whether more than, say, one thirdof the  500M  (7000MF) in development costs can be recovered, without allowing for any interest on this sum..     The public mcney to be invested in production will also be at risk.45.   However   some weight should be put on the fact that, whereasmost of the expenditure is in British or French currencies, the earnings will mostly be in foreign exchange (though often after a delay, because of the need to allow credit to some customer airlines).These foreign exchange earnings or savings might amount to some 1 ,7001  (23,500MF).46.   The future load which Concord will place on the British andFrench aircraft industry represents about 15%  and about 30%respectively of their present strength.     It is- the only remaininglong-haul airliner project in Europe and its future is important forthe maintenance of European progress in advanced aircraft technology.47.    Given the market uncertainty and taking into account the/magnitude
- 11 -magnitude of the gamble, Concord will have the best chance of technical success and substantial sales if the project is pressed forward vigorously and is seen to have the full backing of both governments.(J.

CONCORD ECONOMIC PROSPECTS COMMITTEE - ANNEX BSummary of information received from the manufacturers of Concord and from Air France and BOAC(1)1.     In Britain and France the principal companiesv/ concerned with the project have been consulted.   The consultation was informal, since no specific questions were addressed to them.   They were invited to make knowntheir point of view regarding those economic aspects of the projectwhich appeared important to them.2.     In response to this invitation,     B.A.C. and Sud Aviation providedtwo joint reports, entitled &quot;The penetration of Concord in the world market&quot; and &quot;Evaluation of Concord economics&quot;.   Bristol Siddeley wrotea letter to the British Chairman of the Committee.   Air France submitted a report to the French Chairman, entitled &quot;Note on the economic and commercial prospects of Concords   B.O.A.C. expressed their point of vieworally to British members of the Committee.3.     In both countries, the written submissions were supplemented by oralcommentaries in the course of meetings organised for this purpose.   Thecommittee are greatly obliged to the companies for having responded socompletely at such short notice.4.     The replies related to the total operating costs of Concord ascompared with the subsonic Boeing 707- and Boeing 747 aircraft, to the&apos;penetration&apos; of Concord, to load factors and sonic bang restrictions,and to certain particular problems raised by the manufacturers and the airlines.The comparative operating costs of Concord and subsonic aircraft5.     The table below gives the total operating costs of Concord, as aratio to those of the Boeing 707 and the Boeing 747 for equal loadfactors and for a stage-length of 4j000 km., as they have been estimated by the various bodies concerned.As compared with	Air France	B.0.A.C (1)	B.A.C/            Committee SudBoeing 707 Boeing 747	1 .25 1.47	1.38 1.53	&quot; &quot;1  &apos;   &quot;       ----------------------------- 1.19    .., !         1.30 I         1.40(l)   B.O.A.C. compared only the direct operating costs:   the comparison of total operating costs has been derived -fromthis by the Ministry of Aviation.6.     In order to proceed from the above figures to the relative positionof Concord and the average subsonic aircraft.of 1975s ^ is necessaryalso to take account of the following.Manufacturers i   B.A.C. and Sud Aviation, who were asked toestablish contact with Bristol Siddeleyand 3.N.E.C.M.A.Airlines. s&apos; B.O.A.C. and Air France.
(a) The Boeing 707 and the Boeing 747 can carry both freight andmail in their hold.ss while for Concord it seems that only thetransport of mail will be possible.   B.O.A.C. and Air Franceare in agreement with the official experts in estimating thatthe additional revenues from freight for the subsonic aircraft,if treated as a reduction in costs, result in an,increase of1.05 on each of the figures quoted in the table above.(b) The composition of the subsonic fleets in 1975s which will be amixture of Boeing 707&apos;s and Boeing 747&apos;s or equivalent aircraft.Neither the manufacturers nor the airlines have put a figureon this factor.    The official experts think that the ratio oftotal operating costs of Concord to those of the averagesubsonic aircraft of 1975 will be 0.04 less than the figuresquoted in the above table for the comparison with the boeing 747.The combined effects of the subsonic aircraft1s additional revenue from freight and of the composition of the subsonic fleets in 1975 thusapproximately cancel each other out.7.     The table in paragraph 5 calls for the following comments.(a) Air France&apos;s estimate of the comparison with the Boeing 707appears to be more optimistic than that of the Committee.   Thedifference arises from the fact that Air Prance&apos;s calculationsmake use of data on Concord performance, weight and selling price which were in use before the last revision by officials.The Committee have used for these elements the current officialassumptions, which are more pessimistic.    In fact, on thesame basic assumptions. Air Prance&apos;s calculations would be slightly more pessimistic than those of the Committee.(b) The Boeing 747 will make possible a reduction in total operating costs per seat/km. as compared with the Boeing 707.    this reduction is estimated at \ jfo by Air Prance, 10$ by B.O.A.C.and &amp;fo by officials.   These differences result mainly from different appreciations as to the number of seats which can beinstalled in the Boeing 747 with a comfort equivalent to the boeing 707 with 172 seats.    (The selling price of the Boeing747 seems to be at the moment at.a stage of fairly rapidescalation).8.     The reasons for the considerable gap between the manufacturers&apos;figures (1.19 as compared with existing, subsonic aircraft for a 4,000 km.stage-length in an all-tourist configuration and even 1.16 for a possiblemixed configuration including 10$ of first-class seats) and those of.O.A.C. and Air France and the official &quot;experts are as follows.(a) Differences in basic assumptions about &quot;Concord1s performanceweight, and selling price.   On these- points the officials are more pessimistic than the manufacturers.    (The selling priceestimated by the officials is $17.4OI each for a run of 130aircraft, compared with the manufacturers&apos; figure of /16.OOM.(b) A certain number of modifications proposed by the manufacturersregarding the assumptions used by the official working Party onConcord Operating Economics (document TASC 248)s-an increase in the basic price of the Boeing 707,the application of Customs duties (14$) to aircraft of american origin,a slight reduction in the price of fuel.
-      a reduction in Concord-maintenance costs, -a modification to the basis of calculating financialcharges.9.     The manufacturers also point out that all the estimates of theAmerican manufacturers regarding the absolute levels of Concord operating costs are more optimistic than those of the officials.    (But it isprobable that the same is true as regards the subsonic aircraft.   Figuresquoted in the manufacturers  submissions and relating to United Airlinesconfirm this point of view). . \The penetration of Concord10. The estimates relating to the penetration of Concord on the assumptionthat there is a fare differential also differ considerably.11.   Air France think that the most likely assumption is that Concordwill operate with a fare differential of 20$.   Air France&apos;s experts lay stress on the relative reduction between now and 1975 in business traffic and in the numbers of first-class passengers.   They think that Concordwill have very little impact on tourist traffic.   For Air.France, thefare differential of 20$ will thus limit,the potential market to only20$ of the traffic on the North Atlantic and from 25 to 30$ on -the otherroutes of its network, where business traffic \is relatively higher.12.   According to the manufacturers., -.90/ -of passengers would be willingto pay a fare supplement of 10$ and 50$ a supplement of 25$.   the manufacturers also rely on the estimates of Pan American (40$ of the traffic for a 25$ fare differential) and -of. American Airlines (65$ ofthe traffic for a 15$ fare differential).&apos;13.   Finally, it will.be recalled; that the&apos;, of ficial experts, have estimatedthat Concord will take 48$ of- the traffic with a fare differential of15$.Load factors .,    .14.   Air France thinks that when it first comes into operation Concord1sload factor could be high, ;.but that it would &quot;then level out to aboutSOa/o against an average load factor of 57.5/&quot; for the whole of the long-range fleet (Concord included).. -  .   .15.   The manufacturers,expect a minimum improvement of 7 points inConcord&apos;s load factor;as. compared with competing subsonic aircraft,and estimate that if Concord were to be operated without a faredifferential, its load factor could reach 75$*16.   The official experts have estimated at 65$ the average load factor of Concord over its life (talcing account of the very high load factors ofthe early years) and at 52.5$        average load factor of the subsonicfleet in 1975.Sonic bang restrictions17.   As regards sonic bang restrictions, the manufacturers count on apenetration of at least 75$ of ^he market by Concord, even in the caseof complete prohibition of sonic bangs over land.18.   The official experts have adopted coefficients of 75$ in the caseof partial restrictions and of 55&quot;60$ in &quot;the case of complete prohibitionof sonic bangs over land.
Particular problems raised by the manufacturers and the airlines19.   Problems of operation for Air France.At the relatively low levels of penetration which they haveenvisaged,, Air France believe that the operation of Concord will poseparticular problems for them.   As a result it may be that the actual ,penetration achieved in 1975 will be even lower.(a) It would be difficult to establish a timetable for Concordwhich would be satisfactory on routes with a low density oftraffic.   In fact, since Concord would not be able to obtainmore than 20-25^ of the traffic, the services corresponding to this potential could only represent a few frequencies outof the total.(b) The small seating capacity of Concord would pose a problem ofutilisation of traffic rights on routes where the number offlights permitted to Air France is limited.(c) More generally, Air France&apos;s route networks,which are longand not very dense, would be less well adapted to the use of concord than those of B.O.A.C. or even more those of theAmerican airlines.   For purposes of illustration. Air Franceindicates that if it wished to limit its risks to those whichPan American are taking, it ought not to put into service aConcord fleet exceeding one third of Pan American1s Concordfleet.20.     Profitability of the investment for the AirlinesThe manufacturers say that, on their assumptions which have been described in the preceding paragraphs, Concord will have a profitabilityfor the airlines, of the same order as that of subsonic aircraft.21.     Air France consider that on their own assumptions each Concord theyoperate will cost them a deficit of about  725,000 (lOMF) a year.B.O.A.C. have not yet taken up a position in this matter.22.   Problem of spare engines (observations by Bristol Siddeley)The Olympus 593 engine is a new engine.   For this reason,    duringthe early years of Concord the tine between overhauls will be relatively low, though it will increase progressively.   Consequently, the number of spare engines necessary for each aircraft will be high at the beginning but will decrease progressively.   The means of financing these spare enginesneeds to be studied.   The manufacturers hope that it will be provided bythe operators by means of a sell-and-buy back scheme rather than by themselves.   This system would have the disadvantage that it vrouldnecessitate additional financing of the order of  60M (800mf) for100 aircraft.   So as to facilitate the realisation of this hope, the manufacturers ask whether the development levy on the engines could bereduced, at least in the earlier years.r.214686CONFIDENTIAL
1.     The Federal Aviation Agency&apos;s research and development programmeleading to the construction of a civil supersonic transport aircraft-has reached the point where selection of the best project is to bemade (phase Ii).     The rival companies are Lockheed and Boeing (as prime contractors and as builders of the airframe), and. GeneralElectric and Pratt &amp; Whitney (who would provide the engines).     the choice of prime contractor and engine firm is intended to be made inthe coming weeks.2.     Phase III (construction of two prototypes and 100 hrs. flighttesting) would then start.     The first flight is forecast for June 1970.3*     Phase IV, which covers flight testing up to certification wouldlast three years.     The Federal Aviation Agency have announced thatthe aircraft will be put into service towards the middle of 1974&apos;A.     Development costs, as at present estimated, seem to be 2 to2.5 times those of the Concord programme.     The Federal Governmentwould bear the major portion.Views pf^B.JXA.C. and Air France.5.     At the request of the Federal Aviation Agency some 30 airlineshave recently participated in a detailed evaluation of the proposedAmerican supersonic aircraft.     The comments which follow are based onthe results of this evaluation by B.O.A.C. and Air France.6.     B.O.A.C. and. Air France consider that the Lockheed and Boeingprojects, as at present defined, are not satisfactory.     The maincriticisms relate to range, which will not permit North Atlanticoperation with a full payload, and to noise, which is excessive.7-     The technical solution adopted for the Boeing aircraft(variable geometry wing) should in the long run offer the bestpossibilities for further improvement and seems adapted to the market conditions of the years 1980 and beyond.     There are however risksthat the development of the&apos;..aircraft t may be long-and difficult.8.     On the other hand the simplicity of the Lockheed projectpromises better regularity and safety in operation, especially if theFederal Government continues to aim at 1974-1975 as the in-servicedate.9.     In either case the required increase in range and the reduction ofnoise will involve further study and therefore additional delays.10.   B.O.A.C. have calculated direct operating costs of theseAmerican projects as compared with those of the Boeing 707 and Boeing747-     In making these estimates B.O.A.C. have made their ownallowances for increase of structure weight and operating weight emptyand for a take-off weight permitting sufficient additional fuel togive the two projects adequate range.     From the resulting directoperating costs British Officials have deduced approximate totaloperating costs and operating cost ratios for the North Atlantic forthe various aircraft as follows (on the basis of B.0.A.C.lscalculations).REPORT OF THE CONCORD ECONOMIC PROSPECTS COMMITTEE - ANNEX CThe DAS. S.S.T. projects and comparison with ConcordThe pro gramme of the &quot;Federal Aviation Agency.

It may be seen from this table that the total operating costs ofthe Lockheed and Boeing S.S.T. aircraft are not more than about 5$ to10$ below those of the Concord.   Taking account of the differentstates of development of the Concord on the one hand and the Americanprojects on the other it is probable that the real gains are less thanindicated by these figures.12.   Air France are more optimistic as regards the total operating costs which the American projects might achieve, and think it possiblethat an optimised aircraft might achieve total costs of the same order as those of the Boeing 707.     Nevertheless, Air France allow in their estimates for increases in take-off weight of the order of 20 to 25$.13-   Neither of the two American projects meet airport   noise require-ments envisaged for 1970 and after.     The Boeing project comes closest,but exceeds requirements by some 10 FN&amp;b.     Both projects seem, intheir present state, to be 5 to 10 PNdb noisier than Coneord(lateralnoise).Studies by British and French officials.14-   From information available on the proposals of the two Americanfirms,the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the Service TechniqueAeronautique have both studied the Lockheed project.     The Royal Air-craft Establishment&apos;s experts think that at the weights which will benecessary to carry a full payload of passengers from Paris to New Yorkthe operating costs of the Lockheed 2000 will be only slightly lessthan those of the Concord.     The experts of the Service TechniqueAeronautique estimate by the same methods which lead to a Concord take-off weight of 376,000 lb., Paris-New York, that the take-off weight ofthe Lockheed 2000 will be above 600,000 lbi (which is considerably higher than American estimates).Conclusions.15.   The American projects, as at present proposed, will not permit the carriage of a full payload Paris-New York or London-New York with theassumption of level of fuel reserves and runway length which has beenadopted for the Concord.16.   The studies made by Government Establishments and information supplied by B.O.A.C. suggests that the Lockheed project, after take-offweight increases to give a satisfactory range with full payload, wouldhave total operating costs per seat kilometre not more than 5$ below those of the Concord.     In the same conditions, the corresponding figure for the Boeing project would be of the order of 10$.17.   Take-off noise (lateral noise) of the American projects is considerably greater than that of the Concord and markedly exceeds the noise limits envisaged for the 1970s.
REPORT OF THE CONCORD ECONOMIC PROSPECTS COMMITTEE - AHKEX $Risks of loss on production.1 . This Annex is intended to indicate the losses which might be incurred in the event of aircraft not being sold. The following assumptions have been used.- A production run of 130 aircraft has been decided uponand the average selling price fixed on this basis.- The unit cost of production between 50 and 200 aircraftvrould decrease in accordance with a 90$ learning curve(Wright&apos;s law),.,- One year before delivery of the 50th (or of the 100th)aircraft, It is decided to stop production at this number, all of which are sold.2.     In the above conditions the losses may be estimated asfollows&apos;. 100-130 M (1,4O0-1,800MF) for a stoppage at the 50th aircraft  80-110 M (1 ,100-1 ;,500MF)    &quot;    &quot;       &quot; &quot;    &quot; 100th aircraft.3.     If the decision to stop came abruptly at the moment of delivery of the 50th aircraft (or of the 100th aircraft), the losses could bemuch heavier and could reach twice the sums indicated in paragraph 2.Such a decision would also have other grave consequences associatedwith the abrupt decrease in the aircraft industry&apos;s workload.     Theseconsequences have not been examined in depth.4.     On the other hand, if the decision to stop came more than a year before the delivery of the 50th aircraft (or of the 100th aircraft)the losses would be reduced in as much as the stoppage could be made more gradual.     In the case of as gradual a stoppage as possible atthe 100th aircraft, the losses could be as low as about  30M  (420MF).
REPORT J)F THE CONCORD.ECONOMIC PROSPECTS COMMITTEE -,ANNEX.EEstimates of the market far S.S.T.S by 3ceir.g, Lockheed,andJtflaTstry of Aviation, with brief comment^on some other forecasts1.     Recent estimates by Boeing and Lockheed of the market for their S.S.T.Sand other long-haul aircraft are compared in this Annex with an estimate by theMinistry of Aviation of the possible distribution of aircraft types in thelong-haul market.     Brief notes on some other forecasts are also included,     Alist of references appears at the end of this Annex, and is followed by fourG-raphs (Figs. 1 to 1+) , to which references are made in the text.Traffic growth forecasts2.     Fig. 1 compares forecasts made by Boeing and Lockheed of world passenger traffic (excluding East Europe, U.S.S.R. and China) with the I.C.A.O. mostprobable forecast (Ref. l), and a forecast made by the M.O.A. Market ResearchCroup, cf which the long-haul element (y 2,300 km) is based on the mean of theupper and lower values of growth rates used in assessing the market forConcords.     The Boeing forecast is given in Ref. 2 and includes lioth scheduledand non-scheduled traffic.     Two Lockheed forecasts are shown, both believedte apply to scheduled passenger traffic only.     The lower is the earlier one from Ref. 3, the upper a more recent forecast attributed to Lockheed executiveCarl Kotchian and quoted by Interavia (Ref. 4).     The M.O.A. forecast, made before those of the U.S. firms were studied, comes broadly mid-way between the later Lockheed one and that of Boeing.     The overall spread in the forecastsis large (the ratio of the highest to the lowest is about 2:1 approximately inthe period 1975-1?85) .Aircraft productivities3.     In building up a picture of the contribution by various long-haul air-craft to the forecast of world passenger-km by the M.O.A. in the period up to1980, the aircraft productivities with mixed-class configuration have been used.     These are:-Conoord 0-44   x 10^ pass-km/aircraft-yearU.S. S.S.T. 1-270 x 109   &quot;     &quot; &quot;        11B747 0-67   x 109   &quot;    &quot;        &quot;       &quot;4.     To set against the traffic forecasts by the U.S.&apos;&apos; manufacturers, ratherlower productivities have been used which are believed to correspond more closely with those implied by the estimated market numbers.&apos;given by the U. S.firms.The M.O.A. view,,(Fig. 2)5,     It is extremely difficult to forecast the market for the Concord beyond1975.     At about this time a U.S. S.S.T. may be expected to enter service, andits effect on Concord sales will depend to a large extent on its operatingeconomics vis-a-vis Concord, while on some lower density routes the relativeseat capacities of the two aircraft may well be a major consideration affect-ing sales.6.     It is estimated (see Appendix I to Annex F) that about 160 Concords couldbe utilised on long-haul routes (above 2,300 km) uy 1975, assuming a 15$ faresurcharge and partial boom restriction, leaving the rest *f the long-haulmarket to be served by the ^gjaiyalent of about 260 B747s.     Assuming thatthese aircraft are still in service in 1980, traffic growth between 1975 and1980 would require additional capacity corresponding to about 165 B747s orCONFIDENTIAL/250
-2-250 Concords or 90 U.S. S.S.T.s:    however with the same 15$ fare sur-charge and partial sonic boom restriction as in 1975, the distribution oftraffic between supersonic and subsonio aircraft would require about 80Concord (or 30 U.S. S.S.T.) and 110 B747 for this additional capacity.7.     Also shown on Pig. 2 is a possible build-up of the contribution of(mainly) short-haul aeroplanes wf different capacities to the totaltraffic potential estimated for 1980.     Similar build-ups are shown onPigs. 3 and 4.8.     Pig. 3 shows the world market picture as given by Boeing.     The totaltraffic forecast is again that given in Ref. 2 which also indicates how this total is made up according to the longest sector in a route.     Totals forall routes with no sector longer than 1,100 km and 1,850 km respectivelyhave also been indicated.9- &apos;   Sales predictions for the Boeing 747 passenger version have been given(see Ref. 5) as 307 by 1975 and a further 100 by 1980.10.   Market predictions for the Boeing S.S.T. have been less precise.     Areport In the American magazine Aviation Week (Ref. 6) quoted a Boeing fore-oast of 700-1,800 by 1990, the range representing pessimistic and optimisticlimits.     Since Boeing have not committed themselves to a &apos;most probable&apos;forecast, a total of 900 S.S.T.S has been chosen as probably representingthe firm&apos;s conservative view.11.   Prom Pig. 3 it can be seen that although after 1980 Boeing have leftless than half the world passenger traffic to be carried by aircraft otherthan their S.S.T. and the 747, this still represents a large number of aircraft.     However, assuming that the S.S.T. and 747 are confined to long-haul routes, what is left for other aircraft after 1980 is all on sectorsless than 1,800 km.     It is perhaps significant that the Boeing 727-200 and737 oan operate sectors up to about 1,800 km and that current long-rangeaircraft typified by the B707 will probably all be retired by 1980.The Lockheed view (Fig. 4)12.   Fig. 4 presents this firm&apos;s view of the S.S.T. market as it appears from a recent pronouncement by the Executive Vice-Presilent of Lockheed,reported in Interavia (Ref. 4)-     This said that if air traffic doublesbetween 19^5 and 1975 and doubles again between 1975 and 1985, the -world market for supersonic transports by 1985 &quot;would comprise 907 U.S. S.S.T.Sand approximately 316 Concords, the two aircraft being complementary.The figure shews that these numbers relate to a situation in 1985 whereall air travel is by one or other of these aircraft - which is clearlyludicrous.Other views of the S.S.T. markets(^)   U.S. Department of Defense13.   No numbers are quoted in this report but the conclusion is reached that in competition with the &apos;growth&apos; subsonic jets only, at a 50$ faredifferential, Concord would be chosen by 33$ of the long-haul traffic(900-4,000 statute miles) with no boom restriction and by 10$ withflights restricted to over-water and over sparsely populated land areasonly.(ii)   BAC/^ud14.

A BAC/Sudmarket report in December 1965 estimated the market for Concords in 1975 at about 300 aircraft, assuming no competition from a U.S. S.S.T. up to that datebut with some allowance for the effect of a surcharge ef 25$ and of sonic boomrestriction.(iii)   Stanford ^g^ear^ol^JLns^itute15.     A report produced in 1953 on &quot;An Economic Analysis cf the supersonic transport&quot;   estimated a market potential for a 140 seat, Mach 2, S.3.T. at364 aircraft by 1973, assuming a 10-15$ fare surcharge, but no sonic boomrestriction.     With a U.S. Mach 2 aircraft available within two years of concord, it was estimated that the latter would take 64$ (233 aircraft) of themarket if the U.S. S.S.T. was medium range and 34$ (124 aircraft) if the U.S.aircraft had long range capability.     A total prohibition of flying everinhabited land masses wauld reduce these estimates by about 40$.Conclusionl6.   Boeing market claims for the B747 and S.S.T. relate to an optimistictraffic growth forecast and the presumption that these aircraft will take overall medium and long-haul routes as the current 170 seat long-haul aircraft areretired.     It is doubtful if their market claims make any allowTance for salesby BAC/Sud, Douglas or Lockheed.     Recent forecasts by Lockheed on the market for their S.S.T. and Concords are based on a modest traffic growth rate, butimply that all routes will be operated by these aircraft by 1980, regardless of stage length or traffic density.17.     It is thought that the distribution of aircraft in the various rangebrackets, shown on Fig. 2, represents a more plausible picture t*f thesituation, and indicates the relatively limited market that may be availableto a U.S. S.S.T. in the period 1975-1980.




Estimates have been made cf the present Western World trafficen routes suitable for Concord, and of the growth likely towccur by 1975 and 1980..   Correction factors to this traffichave been deduced for sonic bang route restrictions and forthe fractien of passengers expected to be willing to pay ahigher fare for the shorter Concord journey time.The potential Concord market is calculated from the predictedtraffic with the correction factors applied and the productivity of Concord.   The uncertainty in this marketestimate is assessed by considering the uncertainties in the calculations made in Stages 1 and 2, and the possible effectof the USSST is looked at.Stage 1 - estimation of operating costs and fare differential2. Calculations have followed the method previously used by the Angle-FrenchWorking Group on Concord Operating Economics.   The main assumptions were:-	Concord	707-320B	747Basic price Number of seats (34&quot; pitch) Annual utilisation (hr.) Take-off weight (lb.) Amortisation period (yr.)

The method is conveniently described in three stages, each being explained in greater detail in the appropriate section of this Annex.Stage 1.     Estimates have been made of the seat-km. operating costs of concord, and ef Boeing 707 and 747 as representative of thesubsonic aircraft in airline service in the 1970s.   Fromthese, figures and an assumed mix of 707 and 747 types, the ratio af operating cost ef Concord to an &quot;average 1975 sub-sonic aircraft&quot; has been calculated.   For Concordprofitability to equal that of subsonic aircraft, revenueper seat-km. must be in the same ratio:   estimation of theprobable relative load factors of Concord and subsonic air-craft leads to the fare differential necessary to achieve this.
For a 4,000 km. stage length (a typical average value for long haul airlines)the. ratios of Concord to 707 seat-kilometre costs are:-Number of Concords	100	130Ratio to 707	1 .31	. 1.29Ratio to 747	1 .41	1-394.     It is estimated that in 1975 about 40$ of long haul traffic will becarried T^y 747s, about 35$ by developed DC.8s (with intermediate operating costs) and 25$ by 707, DC.8 and VC.10.     The weighted average operating costof 1975 subsonic aircraft would be about 4$ greater than that of the 747, sothat the ratio of Concord to average subsonic aircraft operating cost perseat km. will be 4$ less than the figure for B747 in paragraph 3.5.     The subsonic aircraft will have capacity for both freight and mail, butConcord for mail only.   Taking into account trends in traffic and rates, itis estimated that the net revenue advantage to subsonic aircraft will be equivalent to a reduction in relative subsonic operating costs of 5$, so thatthe ratio of Concord to average subsonic aircraft operating cost per seat km.is effectively 5$ greater than the figure for the B747 in paragraph 3&apos;6.     Combining the results of paras. 4 and 5, the ratio of Concord to&quot;averago 1975 subsonic&quot; operating costs will be 1$ greater than the Concord/747 ratios shown in para. 3.     Those ratios have been evaluated in 1966 costs,but - as ratios - are&apos; assumed to remain unchanged by 1975&apos;.   They represent theratios of.revenue por seat-kilometre needed to give Concord the same profit-ability (l) in operation as contemporary subsonic aircraft.7.     The necessary increase of some 40$ in revenue per seat-km., comparedwith subsonic aircraft, must be achieved by a higher load factor or a higherfare or some combination of these.   Higher load factor alone is not likelyto suffice.     Subsonic load factors of about 52-g$ have been estimated as anaverage for long-haul routes.   The required Concord load factor would thusapproach 75$ and, although without a fare differential a high percentage of passengers would no doubt choose to fly in Concord, practical considerationssuch as traffic peaks and booking problems will impose a ceiling on averageload factors.   Taking into account payload limitations in the first two years with Stage 0 engines, it is estimated that over a ten-year operating lifeConcords put into service up to 1975 will start with load factors of about70$, may then rise slightly, but will fall to 55-60$ at the end of the period,and will have an average of about 65$.   With this load factor the requiredfare differential would be about 15$.   The difference of about 40$ in revenueper seat-km. thus derives from an advantage of about 12.5 points in the loadfactor (representing an advantage of about 24$) associated with a faredifferential of 15$.Stage 2 - factors affecting Concord traffic8.     A 1964 traffic datum of 55 x 109 passenger-kilometres per year is assumedon routes suitable for Concord operation.   In this figure routes having amaximum sector over 6,000 km. (Concord range with full payload) are excluded,as are routes with a maximum sector less than 2,350 km. (since Concordoperating costs rise rapidly at short ranges).9.     On traffic growth, a detailed study has been made of the contributionto past trends of such factors as   population growth, changes in fares andreal income, and changes in aircraft speed, and an extrapolation to 1975 and1980 has been made for the type of route suitable for Concord.    (Fuller details/of the(l)    &quot;Same profitability&apos; allows for a 6$ return on investment and a percentage on turnover which is equal for the two aircraft.
of the method are given in Appendix I to this Annex.)     ICAO estimates oftraffic growth do not apply directly to such routes, hut figures deduced fromICAO Circular 73-AT/-10 give a growth rate to 1975 higher by 2% per annum as their most probable value.   These two studies have been taken as lower andupper limits, i*e.----	Growth factor by 1975 (compared with 196+)	Mean rate to 1975 j Growth factor	Upper limit Lower limit	3.9 3.2	13$ p.a. 11$ p.a.	6.3 4.510.   The effect of a fare differential will be- to split the passenger traffic between subsonic and supersonic aircraft.    Studios of the percentage of passengers who would choose the supersonic aircraft as a function of the faredifferential have been made, by various bodies, including aircraft manufacturers and airlines, Stanford Research Institute, ITA, Wheatcroft, and the US Departmentof Defense.   There arc large differences in their answers, and we have selectedas the most rational approach the D.O.D. method in which the &quot;passenger prefer-ence function&quot; is related to the percentage differences in fares and journeytimes, and to coefficients expressing the relative importance of time savingand fare saving.    (Fuller details of the method arc given in Appendix 2.)   with suitable weighting for the different time saving over different stage lengths,the 15$ fare differential of para. 7 leads to a preference for Concord by 48$of the passenger traffic.11.   In the absence of any numerical criteria for an acceptable sonic banglevel, an assessment has been made on two assumptions (a) that supersonicflight is permissible only over the sea and that any associated subsonicstages over land are very short, and (b) a partial restriction which permitssupersonic flight over sparsely populated areas, coupled with longer subsoniclegs where necessary.   An analysis covering routes in various parts of theY/orld leads to the conclusion that the full restriction of (a) would reduceConcord traffic to 55-60$ of its unrestricted value, and the partial restriction of (b) to 75$.   This latter value is considered to be the more realistic case.(Fuller details are given in Appendix I.)Stage 3 - potential market for Concord12.   The product of the traffic datum of para. 8, &quot;the average traffic growth of para. 9, the passenger preference factor of para. 10 and the (partial) sonicbang factor of para. 11, gives a 1975 potential Concord traffic of 55 x 109times 3*55 times O.48 times 0.75, or 70.3 x 109 passenger-kilometres per year:with a Concord productivity on an average 4,000 Ion. stage of 0.437 x 10^passenger-kilometres per year at 65$ load factor, the 1975 potential market is160 aircraft.13.   This estimate is subject to uncertainty since there is a degree of un-ccrtainty associated with each stage of the calculation.   The followingestimates have been made of these component uncertainties and of the totaluncertainty in the market estimate.   They are expressed as standard deviations,about a mean, although this can be only a rough approximation./Component

It is assumed that future traffic growth will depend essentially onthe characteristics of the subsonic fleets and that Concord will capturea proportion of this as given by the market-splitting function (see below).   He have taken the following values as the basis of a conservative estimate of traffic growths-REPORT OF THE CONCORD ECONOMIC PROSPECTS COMMITTEE- APPENDIX 1 TO ANNEX .FAn outline of the assumptions&quot;used todetermine Concord market numbersTraffic base s 1964.Concord traffic base has been defined initially by taking 1964traffic on all routes with maximum stages between about 2,300 km. and,000 km.   In this 1964 Concord traffic base the average maximum stage,length, weighted by traffic is 45100 km and the total traffic amounts to55 x 109 passenger-kilometres, of which about 55$ applies to sectorsbetween 4?000 ]cm and 6,000 km.   North Atlantic and Pacific operationsaccount for about 40$ of the base traffic (See Table 1).Traffic growth2.     Two cases have been considered, a mean growth rate for all routes and a separate growth rate for the longer-haul routes typified by the atlantic and Pacific,   The total annual traffic in each case is assumed to vary from year to year according to the following relationship
	Overall mean		Stages over 4*600 kms.		1965-75	1975-80	1964-75	1975-80Population growth	1Z(% increase (M% per annum)	6 73 increase (1i/3 per annum)	1li5S increase (1i/5 per annum)	6i% Increase (14% per annum)Subsonic journey speed	it/5 increase	no change	653 increase	no changeReal Income growth rate	38i53 increase (3/3 per annum)	1Zli53 increase (2i;3 per annum)	38i% increase (353 per annum)	14153 Increase (23/3 per annum)Subsonic fares relative to mean retail prices	3053 fall (3i5o per annum)	553 fall (153 per annum)	3252 fall (3i% per annum)	5% fall (1/3 per annun.)a (lower estimate)	e.5	0.5	0.5	0.53 and Y (lower estimate)	1.5	1.5	1.5	1.5/(T) (lower estimate)	no change 1964-80			Traffic base ; 1975 and 1980.4.     The above values lead to traffic growth ratios for 1975-1964 and 1980-1964of 3.2 and 4*5 as a mean for all routes, corresponding to an annual averagegrowth rate of about 11$ between 1964 and 1975 and 7$ between 1975 and 1980.For stages over 4,600 km., the 1975/1964 and 198O/1964 ratios are 3.4 and 4.8respectively,   corresponding to an average annual growth rate of about 12$ for1964-1975 and 7$ again for 1975-1980.5.     As the basis for a more optimistic growth rate, the values in the absvetable have again been used, with the exception that the value of a has been increased to 0.6 and the value of S and Y increased to 1.8.   Alternatively, thehigher growth rates so obtained may be thought of as implying the retention ofthe same value cf elasticity coefficients as used for the conservative estimate,but with an allowance for residual traffic growth other than that due to changesin population, speed, incomes and fares (the /(y)* function).   The traffic growthratios for 1975/1964 and 1980/1964 with these latter assumptions are about 3*and 6.3 for all routes and 4.2 and 6.7 for stages over 4,600 kms.    Thesecorrespond tc average annual growth rates for 1964-1975 of abaut 13$ for allroutes and about 14$ for stages ever 4,600 kms., while for 1975-1980 the averagegrowth rate is about 9l$ ^n both cases.   These higher growth rates may be inter-preted as representing ICA0&apos;s assessment of the most probable traffic growthrates over respectively long - haul routes generally and for routes typifiedby the North Atlantic.6. In assessing market numbers, the mean of the upper and lower values oftraffic growth rates, as detailed above, has been assumed in the absence ofany strong reason for supporting either the upper or Ibwer values (see Table 2).Effect of surcharge cn the proportion of traffic available to Concord.7.     With a ratio of Concord/sabsonic aircraft costs of 1.42 and a ratio of concord/subsonic load factors of 65$/52-g$, it follows that the fare surchargerequired on Concord will be 1.42 x 52.5/65 = 1.15 or 15$ surcharge.   With themarket splitting functions suggested in the U-S. Dept. of Defense paper on &quot;the limited Market for Concord&apos; (fare/time saving preference ratis   of 1/3) and assuming time saving is based on journey time, then the moan time saving overAPPENDIX 1 TO ANNEX P (Continued)
C.OKFIEBNTIAL,   jU?pENI)]rx 1 to Mmx p (Continued)all routes for Concord cf. subsonic aircraft is estimated to be 33$, and 40$for stages over 4,600 kms.    These lead to penetration factors of 48$ as anaverage for all routes and 35% for routes over 4,600 km. (see Table 2).   Anote on the derivation of the D.O.D. formula is given at Appendix I.Effect cf sonic bang restrictions8.     The traffic available to Concord after the effect of a 15$ fare surchargehas been taken into account, has been further modified to allow for the effectof possible prohibition of supersonic flying over land due to the nuisancecaused by sonic bangs.   Two cases have been postulated.    One, a full restric-tion resulting in supersonic flying taking place on ever-water routes only,or when such flights are coupled with very short stages over land it is presumed that these are performed at subsonic speed.   Such restrictions weuld be unlikely to have any effect on Pacific or Europe to South America routes, only a smalleffect on Atlantic and North to South America routes, but might eliminate allother routes with the possible exception of a small element of Europe to Africaoperations.   The overall effect of this would be to reduce the traffic estimated as available to Concord without sonic bang effects by a factor of about 0.55-0.60.The second case is a partial restriction, taking a less pessimistic viewof the economic effect of flying longer subsonic legs and of the possibility of lying supersonically over sparsely-populated land areas.   Europe-Ear East and europe-Australia routes would then be completely unrestricted, Europe-Africahalf restricted, and a small element (15-20$) of U.S. and Canadian domestictraffic might also become suitable for Concord.   The overall factor with thispartial restriction is estimated to be 0.75 (see Table 2).Market numbers9.     The final market numbers, assuming a gro\7th rate mid-way between theuppor and lower values given in paras. 4 and 5 above, and after taking intoaccount the effect of a fare surcharge ef 15$ and either partial or fullsonic boom restrictions, arc 162 and 118 aircraft respectively in 1975.Sstimatos of Concord market number in 1980 would be much less reliable, inpart due to the uncertainties surrounding the US. SST, and they are thereforeomitted.

The value for oc cannot be determined so closely;   the growth of traffic on N* Atlantic and Pacific routes is consistent with a -r  0.5.   The D.O.D. paper quoting the modal split formula claimed thatthe ratio can. bo justified by trends in U.S. domestic traffic.5.    For Concord market estimates, the Ministry of Aviation have taken ^^5. y&apos; as journey speed (i.c. with an allowance of two hours for origin-airport andairport-destination travelling in all cases) and have used weighted means for V  and F ,CONCORD ECONOMIC PROSPECTS COMMITTEE - APPENDIX 2. to ANNEX F.Derivation of the POD Formula for Supersonic/Subsonic Modal Split.1.     Air traffic, especially on long-haul routes, has been growing at a much higher rate (18$ per annum average over the last ten years) than surfacetraffic (typically 5-6$ per annum).   This capture by air transport of an increasing share of world traffic must be due to three factors:-(a) air journey speeds have been increasing relative to surfacespeeds, (except on certain short-haul routes),(b) . air fare rates have been falling relative to surface travelcosts and other retail prices, and(c) the habit of air travel is still spreading.2.     The effect of speed and fare changes on past trends in the level of air traffic on a particular route may be analysed by assuming thattraffic T   varies as  -^-5where V is the ratio of air to surface journey speed and F is the ratio ofmean air fare per passenger kilometre to other prices.   Then the increase intraffic   T resulting from a small increase 5V in speed ratio and a smalldecrease SF in fare index is6T   s cc6v   4- P6FT V F3.     Consider the case where one aircraft is operated on a route at, say,Concord faro index F2 and subsonic journey speed ratio V-j.   If the speedratio were increased to that appropriate for Concord, V2, keeping fare etc.constant, there would be an increase in traffic ATy due to the spoed-conscious element of the travelling public.*       a (V2-V1)m -sc-- VInhere T,V   are,mean values between the original and new traffic and speedsrespectively.
