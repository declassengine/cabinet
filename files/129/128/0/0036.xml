DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT)C(67) 36COPY NO.   gg21st March, 1967CABINETTHE KENNEDY ROUND; CEREALSMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture fFisheries and FoodThere are three main elements in the negotiations -(i)      Access - the exporters (United States, Canada, Australiaand Argentina) seek commitments from the principalimporting countries (European Economic Community (e.c.),Japan and the United Kingdom) to maintain imports ofwheat and coarse grains at recent levels and to assureexporters of a similar share of the growth of futuredemand.2.      The Japanese have no difficulty in providing satisfactory assurances on access since their cereals production is not keeping pace with the growth in consumption and Japanese grain imports will increasein any event.    The negotiations therefore centre on proposed selfsufficiency ratios for the e.c. and the United Kingdom,    The selfsufficiency ratio is domestic production expressed as a percentage of domestic consumption.    It is envisaged that the e.c. and the UnitedKingdom would undertake to limit production to these percentages andif the percentages were exceeded would withhold the excess production from the commercial market by storing it or diverting it to food aid, or make an equivalent cash contribution to food aid in respect of the excess.3,     The e.c. are more favourably placed than the United Kingdom toaccept a self sufficiency ratio since e.c. production is expanding moreslowly than production in the United Kingdom.    The e.c. have proposed for themselves a ratio of 90 per cent compared with an average selfsufficiency ratio of 87 per cent for the period 1962-63 to 1964-65.    Inthe last two years because of poor harvests and rising consumption selfsufficiency in the e.c. has only been about 84 per ctut to 85 per cent andthey do not expect to reach more than 88 per cent by 1970.    For practical purposes the area of negotiations between the e.c. and the exporters liesbetween 87 per cent and 90 per cent.(ii)Price - the level of minimum and maximum prices in international trade.(iii)Food Aid - a multilateral food aid programme.Access-1-
CONFIDENTIAL.4,     The United Kingdom position is much more difficult.     Our selfsufficiency has been rising rapidly in recent years.    In the last two years it has been about 64 per cent.    In 1967-68 it is expected to rise to67 per cent and may well reach 70 per cent in 1968-69.    The selective expansion programme under the National Plan implies a ratio of72 per cent by 1970-71.5.     To allow room for manoeuvre the United Kingdom has so faroffered a self sufficiency ratio of 75 per cent.    The exporters howeverstart from the present position which they regard as about 65 per cent.The area of negotiation In our case lies therefore between 65 per cent and 75 per cent.    Our objective is to get as near as possible to72 per cent - the National Plan figure - and certainly not less than70 per cent.Prices6,     The exporters have proposed that the maximum and minimum prices under the present International Wheat Agreement (IWA) should beraised by 40 cents per hushel or more than  5 per ton.    The e.c. whoare not exporters of wheat also favour higher maximum and minimum prices, although somewhat less than the exporters have proposed.Subject to important points of detail, they v/ould be prepared to go along with the exporters&apos; proposals.    The exporters have made it clear thatthey will not agree to renewal of the present TWA which expires inJuly, 1967 unless substantially higher prices are accepted.7.     As major importers, Japan and the United Kingdom oppose anysubstantial increase in prices.    Ministers have however authorised theUnited Kingdom delegation to negotiate an increase of up to   2 per to non the present IWA minimum.    This v/ould be about  1 per ton abovethe level of our present minimum import prices.     The United states delegation have indicated privately that they are prepared to come downsubstantially from the exporters1 proposed 40 cent increase and theUnited Kingdom delegation expect to be able to operate effectively withinthe limits of their existing authority.    No further instructions arenecessary at this stage,8,     The e.c. and the United Kingdom are also insisting on the intro-duction of maximum and minimum prices for coarse grains as acounterpart to their undertakings on access which will cover bothwheat and coarse grains.    The Americans are strongly opposed to price provisions for coarse grains.    Both the e.c. and the UnitedKingdom will, however, continue to insist for the present on priceprovisions for coarse grains as a means of securing better terms onaccess and the level of wheat prices.Food Aid9.     The Americans with the support of the other exporters have proposed a multilateral food aid programme for the supply of tenmillion tons annually of wheat to the developing countries.    this programme, which would cost about  250 million would be additional to existing bilateral food aid programmes.     The main object of the americans is to secure a more equitable sharing of the burden of food aid which they have so far been carrying almost single-handed.    Underthe proposals the cost of the new programme would be shared by bothimporters and exporters.    The scale of contribution envisaged is roughly - United States 40 per cent, e.c. 20 per cent, Canada 10 per cent,Australia 5 per cent and the United Kingdom 5 per cent.
10. &quot;While insisting that a food aid programme is an essential element in a satisfactory cereals agreement, the Americans accept that the size of the programme is a matter for negotiation.    Frominformal bilateral talks the United Kingdom delegation are satisfiedthat the total programme could be reduced to four million tons.The cost of the United Kingdom contribution at 5 per cent to a programmeof this size would be  5 million.11. None of the major importers as yet has agreed tocontribute to such a programme.    The e.c. recognise   however that agreement to contribute to such a programme would be a valuablebargaining factor in securing better terms on access.    The Japanesealso recognise that under United States pressure they will probably have to go along with a modest programme.    The United Kingdomposition is similar to that of the e.c. and the United kingdom delegation consider that United Kingdom agreement to a contributionnot exceeding  5 million is essential to enable the United Kingdom toobtain satisfactory terms both on price and the proposed selfsufficiency ratio.T.
