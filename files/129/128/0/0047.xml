CONFIDENTIALInOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)g6C(67) 47 COPY NO.      &quot;8th April, 1967CAB METATTENDANCE OF MINISTERS BEFORE SELECT COMMITTEESMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure have considered the problems which are likely to present themselves to ministers when invited to give evidence before Select Committees.The Estimates and Public Accounts Committees, being concerned primarily with matters of administration, do not summon ministers as witnesses.    But the new Specialist Committees, which are notprevented from considering policy matters, have been encouraged to expect Ministers to appear before them.    Influenced no doubt bythis the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries are now invitinga&apos;number of Ministers to give evidence on a matter currently underinvestigation;  namely the relationship between Ministers on the onehand and the Chairmen and Members of Nationalised Boards on theother.    If, as we may expect, new Specialist Committees are addednext Session, attendance before Select Committees may well becomepart of a Minister&apos;s responsibility to Parliament, nearly as important as his participation in Debates on the floor.    It is important, therefore,to work out as soon as possible a code of practice for Ministers such as has been evolved at official level by experience of appearing before theEstimates and Public Accounts Committees.    There is, in particular,a need for uniformity of practice between Ministers in relation to matters which may be sensitive in one Ministry but not in others.2.       The Ministerial Committee consider that a convention shouldbe established with the Chairmen of Committees that Ministers, before giving oral evidence, should put in a written memorandum of evidence on the matters which the Select Committees wish to discuss with them.It should be understood that subsequent questioning will normally be confined to the scope of the memorandum.    It might be wise to establish an arrangement that officials should continue to be the main source ofevidence on matters of fact and administration and that Ministers will only appear where policy issues are being raised.3.       Whether Ministers should appear in private or in public sessionis a question on which no simple rule can be laid down.    Similarly, if ministers attend in closed session, no rule can be laid down whetherthey should seek to give evidence informally and off the record orwhether they should simply confine themselves to requesting the exclusion from published evidence of specific passages or information which should not be disclosed in the public interest.    circumstances will obviously vary.    It would probably be unwise, on a matter asdelicate as the relationship between Ministers and Nationalised Boards,
for Ministers to give evidence in public session.     On the other hand there might be no objection, for example, to the Minister of Agricultureisgiving evidence in public to the Specialist Committee on Agricultureif that were his wish.    It has been suggested that Select Committeesmight gain more from the presence of Ministers if the sessions wereprivate and informal and no record of evidence was taken.    But thatis a matter for the Select Committees themselves and the ministerial committee do not think that it v/ould be prudent for the Government togive the appearance of trying to strike a bargain about Ministerialattendance,4.       The Ministerial Committee think, however, that the cabinet should decide clearly against Ministers giving in evidence or discussing:-(l)     Information relating to the private affairs of individuals, individual companies or institutions on which any information held by Ministers or their officials has been supplied on a confidential basis.    Relations withindividuals, companies or institutions would be seriously jeopardised ifany threat appeared to the seal of confidentiality under which information is now given,(2)    Information affecting national security which would normally be&apos;withheld from the House in the national interest,(3)    Miatters which are the subject of sensitive negotiation with governments or other bodies,(4)     Specific cases where the Minister has or may have a quasi-judicial or appellate function, e. g. in relation to planning applicationsand appeals.(5)    Matters on which Government policy has been decided and onwhich legislation is shortly to be presented to the House.R.H.S..C.Privy Council Office, S.W.17th April, 1967
