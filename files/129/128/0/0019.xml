CONFIDE NTH Ai, &apos;      \ 7DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67)1920th February, 1967FAMILY endowment memorandum by the Minister of Social security in C(67) 17 the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the minister without Portfolio have put forward some criticisms of the &quot;give and take&quot; scheme, together with new proposals described as a &quot;directaid approach&quot;. 7/hile not claiming that the &quot;give and take&quot; schemeis free from difficulties, I consider that C(67) 17 greatly overstatesthem, besides ignoring both the virtues of such a solution and theserious objections to any means-tested scheme.The relation between family allowances and income tax child allowances2.       Although family allowances and income tax child allowances servedifferent purposes, this surely does not mean that they have to be looked at in total isolation from each other.    Indeed, in our last election manifesto we promised that we should &quot;seek ways of integrating more fully the two quite different systems of social payment - tax allowances and cash benefits paid under National Insurance&quot;.    Some of the arguments in C(67) 17 - In particular, that the cut in the tax allowances made underthe &quot;give and take&quot; scheme might have to-be restored - seem to rest onthe supposition that an increase in family allowances does not improve afamilyls income and taxable capacity, and leaves their need for aparticular level of tax allowances (i, e. as compared with, for example,a childless couple) unchanged.    Nor do I see why the &quot;give and take&quot;scheme need have the repercussions or the restrictive effect on futuretaxation policy suggested in C(67) 17;  it is essentially no more than an operation to adjust at a particular point in time the relative roles ofthese two forms of help for families.Public acceptability of a &quot;give and take&quot; scheme3.       It is true that there has recently been unfavourable press comment on a scheme, allegedly being contemplated by the Government,which would hit heavily a large number of families in the middle incomerange and whose cost v/ould be borne by people with children while thosewithout escaped unscathed.    But, as I have made clear in C(67) 7, thescheme I advocate does neither of these things.    It would be quitewrong to allow criticisms of a hypothetical redistributive type of schemeto influence our attitude to the fundamentally different type of scheme Iam proposing, which the public has so far been given no opportunity toconsider.    I do not see any great difficulty in getting across to thepublic the essentially simple idea underlying this scheme, or in dealingwith any fantasies about future &quot;confiscations&quot; of tax allowances.-1-&apos; figCOPY NO.        u wCABINET
4.       Paragraph 5 of C(67) 17 refers to the extra numbers v/ho will bebrought into the taxable range or have their tax increased, and suggeststhat this will discourage extra effort.     But those concerned will still beleft with the greater part of their existing child tax allowances, and so will remain considerably lower down on the tax scale than one-child or(still more) no-child families with the same earnings.    For example,on earnings of  20 a week, a single person and a married man without children pay income tax of about  3 16s. 6d. and  2 17s. 6d. a weekrespectively;  and both are in the standard rate tax range, i. e. paytax on additional earnings at a rate of 6s. 5d. in the pound (the standard rate of 8s. 3d, less ^/cjths earned income relief).    By contrast, afterthe &quot;give and take&quot; operation (involving a  45 reduction in the relevanttax allowances), a married man earning  20 a week and having, forexample, two children aged 11-15 and one under 11, will pay tax, includingthe tax on the increased family allowances, of about 24s, Od. a week;  andhe will be some way below the standard rate tax range, paying tax on additional earnings at a rate of 4s. 8d. in the pound (the 6s. Od. reduced rate less **/c)ths earned income relief),    I see no reason to suppose thatin these circumstances men with two or more children will work lesshard than men with one child or none - if anything, I should have thoughtrather the reverse.     On the other hand, the paper ignores the real disintegration-centive effect of any means-tested allowance, regardless of whether it is paid to the husband or the wife.The proposed &quot;direct aid&quot; approach5.       The essence of the proposals listed in paragraph 19 of C(67) 17lies in items (i) and (ii).    Items (iii), (iv) and (vi) could go along equallywell with the &quot;give and take&quot; scheme;   there is no apparent interdepen-dence of substance or of timetable.    Item (v) - special treatment forfatherless families - is a subject on its own, which my department has under study as part of the social security review.     The full rateof supplementary benefit, including the long-term addition, is already available to fatherless families with low resources, and my Departmentsrecent survey confirmed that the vast majority of those fatherless familieswhich are eligible are being looked after under this scheme.     Beforespecially favourable treatment for fatherless families could be justifiedwe should need convincing reasons, which at present are not apparent,for differentiating them from other families deprived of the father&apos;earnings, e. g, through sickness or unemployment.6.       Although the main proposal is described as a scheme of supple-mentary family allowances, it is in fact merely another variety of means-tested scheme, with the objectionable features common to all such schemes.    It could not be convincingly represented as an extensionof the family allowances scheme, both because it would have to be separately administered and because the rules would need to differ in a number of respects.7.       Moreover, this scheme is markedly ineffective in helping the poorest families, i. e. those with incomes deficient by supplementary benefit standards.    Even with the additional help of the proposedstraightforward increase of family allowances for the fourth and subsequent children, only about 65 per cent of the families in the&quot;deficiency&quot; area would be lifted out of it.     Moreover, that nurnberwould include only about 62 per cent of the total number r-f children in such families, as against a figure of about 65 per cent of the

Even with the additional help of the proposedstraightforward increase of family allowances for the fourth and subsequent children, only about 65 per cent of the families in the&quot;deficiency&quot; area would be lifted out of it.    Moreover, that numberwould include only about 62 per cent of the total number r-f children in such families, as against a figure of about 65 per cent of the
children lifted out by the 10sG Od. &quot;give and take&quot; scheme,     This is because the C(67) 17 proposals give proportionately most help to thesmaller families in the &quot;deficiency&quot; area (10 s. Od. each for the first three children, only 5s. Od. for the fourth and subsequent), whereasneed tends to be greatest among the larger families:  over half of thechildren in the &quot;deficiency&quot; area are in families with four or more children (C(67) 7, Annex A, paragraph 9).8.       Such a scheme would be wide open to criticism for not solving the &quot;deficiency&quot; problem, and to pressure for expansion so that it did.Once the bridge has been crossed by the adoption of a means-testedscheme, I doubt whether there is any defensible stopping point short of straightforward supplementation of earnings to bring them up to full supplementary benefit standards.     The &quot;give and take&quot; scheme,on the other hand- is protected against this because it patently doesnot set out to achieve something which, within any reasonable figureof costi can only be done with a means-tested approach.9.       In any case I have serious doubts about the possibility ofmaintaining two different standards of means-tested cash payments,operated by the same Department, one more favourable in some circumstances and the other in others.    For example, I understandthat the scheme in C(67) 17 assumes that there would be no disregard of the wife&apos;s earnings such as is given in calculating supplementary benefit entitlement;  if, as I would judge, this could not be held, thecost of  11-12 million a year for this part of the proposals v/ould beincreased by about  2 million, bringing the combined cost of the twofamily endowment proposals up to  25-26 million a.year.     This is not all that far below the cost of the &quot;give and take&quot; scheme (apart fromthe once-and-for-all extra cost in the first year, caused by the time-lag in the tax system).10.       The j)attern of help resulting from the proposals in C(67) 17v/ould be -First child - A rneanst-tested allowance of up to 10s. Od.Second child - Family allowance of 8s. Od. , plus a means-testedallowance of up to 10s. Od. - a total of up to 18s. 0d.Third child - Family allowance of 10s, , plus a means-testedallowance of up to 10s. Od. - a totg.1 of up to 20s. Od,Fourth child - Family allowance of 15s. Od. (or perhaps 17s. 6d. )Fifth and subsequent children - Family allowance of 15s. Od.(or perhaps 10s. Od.).I do not see how such a pattern could be rationally defended.    And bycontaining something to displease everybody it would be likely to pleasenobody:  it would irritate both those v/ho dislike means-testing and thosewho object to giving extra help regardless of need.    (For the largerfamilies, an increase of 5s, Od. in family allowances for the fourth and subsequent children, at an extra cost of  12 million a year, giveshelp to rich and poor alike, something which at least the &quot;give and take&quot;scheme does not do).
Incomes policy11.       I have stated in C(67) 7 (paragraphs 7 and 8) my reasons for believing that the &quot;give and take&quot; scheme would help to restrain wage claims rather than stimulate them.    The argument in paragraph 12 ofC(67) 17, that the increased family allowances would do nothing to reducev/age claims by all the people who do not have two or more children,ignores the fact that wage claims are made for the whole group ofworkers in a particular category, not for sub-groups according totheir family circumstances, and that they are often pressed on behalfof the whole group on the ground that those members with middle orlarge sized families are suffering hardship.12.      A means -tested scheme would surely act as a permanent stimulus to wage demands,     The fact that a means-tested supplement had to bepaid for a substantial number of families with the father in regular full-time work and a by no means excessive number of children, v/ould providethe strongest possible support for a claim that the wages in the father rsoccupation were unduly low.Conclusion13.       Nothing in C(67) 17 leads me to alter my view that &quot;give and take&quot;is the right answer and means-testing the wrong one, and that the choiceto be made here is of fundamental importance not merely for the future of family endowment but for the whole of our social policy and, ultimately,for the kind of society we shall be creating.     The objections to anextension of means-testing to people in work remain valid for the solidpractical reasons explained in my earlier papers (C(66) 157 andC(66) 183), and above all because of its harmful effects - all themore harmful for being insidious - on a man&apos;s independence, dignity and incentive to work.M.
