DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CJ67) 2914th March, 1967COPY NO.6CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE POST OFFICE;DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Postmaster general in July, 1966, (CC(66) 36th Conclusions, Minute 4), the cabinet decided that the postal and telecommunications services of the Post office should be transferred to a new public Corporation to be set up for thepurpose.    I announced the decision in Parliament on 3rd August, 1966.The Cabinet invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and me to give further consideration to what should be done with the Post Office SavingsDepartment.    We recommended that it should remain in the Civil Service,reporting to Treasury Ministers,    The Prime Minister accepted this and I announced it in Parliament on 15th November.    The new NationalGiro and the existing Post Office remittance services are to become theresponsibility of the Corporation.2.      I undertook to present a White Paper to Parliament setting out proposals for the reorganisation when the Select Committee on nationalised Industries had reported on its current enquiry into thePost Office, and after consultation with the staff.3.       The terms of the White Paper have been discussed by the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy who have agreed the attached draft.    The reference to a national Data Processing Service inparagraph 25 is dependent on the outcome of the present considerationof this question,4.      When I announced the decision I indicated that I expected vestingday for the new Corporation to be vvdthin about three years.    I now feelthat from the practical point of view the right target date for vesting is1st April, 1969.    This means that we must secure Royal Assent to theBill by July, 1968.    A place has been sought in the legislative programme,and we are aiming to introduce the Bill in time for the Second Reading totake place before the Christmas recess.5.      In keeping with this timetable, and subject to clearance of thepoint about the National Data Processing Service, I invite the Cabinetrsagreement to my presenting the White Paper to Parliament before easter.E. W. SPost Office Headquarters, E.C.1.13th March, 1967
DRAFT WHITE PAPERREORGANISATION OF THE POST OFFICETntro duct ionX,    The Post Office provides two major public utilities - posts and telecommunications - whieh play a vital part in the e&amp;onomicand social life of the nation*    Its operations are correspondinglyvast.   During the last financial year it- handled transactions to a total value of  7?900m.- invested  210m. - or more than any other publicundertaking except Electricity Supply.- dealt with 11,300 million letters and 6,900 milliontelephone calls.At the end of the financial year the written-down value of itsfixed assets was over  l,hO0m.    Its staff form nearly 2% of theworking population or about half the non-industrial Civil Service.2o    Trading operations on this scale must be managed on commerciallines if they are to be efficient.    Successive Governments have sought to adapt the status and structure of the Post Office tomeet this requirement.   This began with the important changes in organisation which followed the Bridgeman Report in 1932.    Since1955 the Post Office has been responsible for balancing its ownincome and expenditure, and has been explicity encouraged to conduct its business as a commercial enterprise.   In 1961 itsfinances were separated from the Exchequer.    Since then it has been subject to financial disciplines similar to those applying to thestatutory nationalised authorities.    But constitutionally it isstill a Government Department, with a Minister at its head who mustanswer to Parliament for its day-to-day operations,3.    The Government have carried out a fundamental review of thePost Office, set against the challenging future of change and expansion which faces many of its services.   Its present structure and methods are those of a Department of State.    These have been- 1 -
evolved primarily for the formulation and execution of government policy? and are geared to the discharge of ministerial responsibility to parliament.   They are unsuited to the running of the postal,telecommunications and remittance services, and the new G-iroservice (Cmnd. 2751)*    The Government concluded that the processbegun in 1932 should be carried to its logical conclusion.   A public corporation should be created to run these great businesses with astructure and methods designed directly to meet their needs, draw-ing on the best modern practice.k,    The Postmaster General announced this decision in Parliament on 3rd August 1966.    In November 1966 he told Parliament that thePoet Office Savings Department would remain as part of the CivilService and would report to Treasury Ministers.    It will be known in future as the National Savings Department.5.    The Government undertook that when the House of Commons&apos; SelectCommittee on Nationalised Industries had completed.its enquiry intothe Post Office, and after consultation with representatives of thestaff, the Postmaster General would present a White Paper toParliament.   This would set out proposals for the reorganisation.The Select Committee presented its Report on 28th February 1967*ESTABLISHMENT OP THE CORPORATION6.    The Post Office is a major Department of State.   Practicallythe whole of it is involved in the constitutional change.   This isan undertaking without precedent.    Moreover, Post Office services are an integral part of the nation&apos;s life.    In addition to communi-cations, the Post Office provides part of the machinery of the social security system, and many other kinds of business are transacted atPost Office counters.   The Governments objective is to create an authority which will-   be responsible for developing the most efficient servicespossible, at the lowest charges consistent with soundfinancial policies.- 2 -
carry on in a worthy manner the Post Office tradition ofservice to the public,develop relations with its staff in a forward-looking and progressive way.Mrrhstepial Organisation7,    The Government have decided that a single Minister of theCrown will bear ministerial responsibility for the new corporation and for the residue   of the Postmaster General&apos;s functions (exceptSavings).   An announcement as to which Minister will assume these functions will be made in due course.Titles and Insignia8.   The Corporation will be known as &quot;The Post Office&quot;.   Her majesty the Queen has been pleased to approve that the title &quot;Royal Mail&quot;should continue, and that the Corporation should use the Crown andthe Royal Cypher as the Post Office does   at presento    the sovereign&apos;s head will continue to be included in the design ofstamps and postal orders.   Postage stamp designs will be consideredjointly by the Corporation and by the Minister and submitted toHer Majesty by the latter.Legislation9.    The Government intend to introduce a Bill establishing theCorporation in the 1967-68 Session.    The members of the corporation will be appointed as soon as possible after the Bill becomes law.As soon as possible after that - on &quot;vesting day&quot; - the corporation will take over active responsibility for the services and will assume the appropriate assets and liabilities of the Post Office.  Jtitipn in Northern Ireland10.   The Corporation, like the Post Office, will operate inNorthern Ireland, as in other parts of the United Kingdom.SSLjPJLigATIONS OF THE CORPORATION11.   The essential purpose of the change will fail unless theCorporation has effective freedom of a kind appropriate to a- 3 -
nationalised authority.   Yet the special role of the Corporation^services in the social fabric of Britain, and its monopoly of pro-yiding many of them, must carry special obligations.    TheGovernment intend that these requirements should be reflected, bothin the legislation and in the relationships of the Corporation withits users, with Parliament and with the Minister.TfrfijServices12,   The Corporation^ most important responsibilities will be toprovide letter and telephone services for the country as a whole,and to meet the needs of commerce and industry for inland and overseas communications.13.  Post Office counter services play a vital part in the nationalSocial Security system.   The Government consider it essential toprovide statutory safeguards for the future functioning of thissystem.   The Bill will confer on the Minister a reserve power togive directions to the Corporation to make its own counterfacilities available for central Government and Government ofNorthern Ireland servi&amp;es.Financial ObligationslUo   The Corporation will have the same sort of financial obliga-tions as other nationalised industries.    It will be expected,  as thePost Office is now, to pay its way with a sufficient margin betweenincome and expenditure to make suitable allocations to reserves.It will observe the criteria set out in paragraphs 19-23 of theWhite Paper on the Financial and Economic Obligations of the nationalised Industries (Cmnd. 1337)-   The Corporation will be setfinancial targets by the Minister to provide a stimulus to efficiency and to ensure that it generates an appropriate proportion of its owncapital requirements.    The Minister will discuss these with, theCorporation as soon as possible.15. The Corporation will inherit a number of public services whichcannot be made financially viable at any reasonable level of charga.The outstanding example is the inland telegraph service, which has.- k -
run at a loss for many decades and cannot hope to pay for itself as its use continues to decline .   Obligations of this kind are normallytaKen into account when financial targets are fixed.l6.   At present the Post Office provides agency services to theGovernment at &apos;cost&apos; which includes the overheads of the servicesthemselves but excludes a proper contribution to the Post Office&apos; soverall financial obligation.    In future, the prices charged foragency services should make such a contribution to the achievement of the Corporation^ financial obligations and the Corporation willnegotiate with client Departments contracts designed with thisobject   in view.    The Minister will be given a reserve power todetermine the charge to be made in the event of disagreement.THE POSITION OF PARLIAMENT17.   The constitution and responsibilities of the Corporation willbe embodied in legislation.    Its accountability to Parliament willbe different from that at present.    There will no longer be a minister answerable to Parliament for its day-to-day activities.But both Houses will have the opportunity to consider the Report and accounts of the Corporation when these are laid before Parliamentevery year.   The work of the Corporation will be subject to scrutinyby Committees of the House of Commons.    Increases in the total amountit may borrow will need to be approved by the House of Commons.18.   The Minister responsible for the Government&apos;s functions inrelation to the Corporation will be answerable to Parliament for thedischarge of these functions and for the exercise of his powers(see para. 37 below).SAFEGUARDS FOR THE USER19.   Parliament and public have a right to expect guarantees thatthe Corporation will be responsive to the social and business needsof users and sensitive to their opinion.   For this reason, theGovernment attach great importance to the arrangements to be madefor user consultation.20&quot;   The keystone of the consultative structure will be a nationalUsers&apos; Council to be established by legislation, with a secretariat- 5 -CONFIDENTIAL
independent of the Corporation.    In appointing the Council theMinister will take account of the desirability of having members whogre familiar with the special requirements and   circumstances of thevarious parts of Britain.   Arrangements will be made to ensure thatthere is effective consultative machinery below national level.   TheCouncil will represent the interests of all users.    It will be ableto make recommendations about the services.   It will consider pro-posals  put to it by the Corporation, and any complaints from individual users which may be remitted to it from below national level.   The user consultative machinery as a whole will be flexible and readily adaptable to change.21.   The Bill will require the Corporation to consult the Councilabout all major proposals affecting its main services, in so far as these affect users.    This will extend to proposals to vary, intro-duce or discontinue main services on a national scale.    Its function in relation to charges and conditions of service is explained in para. 2h below.    The Users&apos; Council will have access to the minister if it disagrees with the Corporation.    The Government will do all they can to foster a successful working relationship between theCorporation, the Council and. the other consultative organs.CHARGES AND CONDITIONS22.   The Corporation, like all other businesses and the nationalised industries, will be expected to have regard to the requirements ofthe national prices and incomes policy and their charges will besubject to prices and incomes legislation.    It will also be expectedto follow the informal arrangements for consultation about sub-stantial changes in the&apos; level of prices between the Boards of nationalised industries and the Ministers concerned currentlyformalised in the arrangements for early warning of increases inprices or charges described in the White Paper - Prices and incomes policy:   &quot;Early Warning&quot; System (Cmnd. 2808).23.   Subject to these general considerations, the Corporation willitself have statutory power to fix charges for its services and-- 6 -
ffici3.ities and the conditions on which they are to be provided.    Itbe required to publish these charges and conditions.2li,  The Government intend that the advice of the Users&apos; Council, asthe principal organ of consumer interest, should play an importantrole in the fixing of the Corporation^ charges and conditions ofservice.   But these will necessarily cover a very wide range indeed,including both the major elements of the main services - like thecharge for a letter or telephone call charges -   and those for minor and ancillary services and facilities, used only by relatively few people, but requiring to be set out in great detail.    The government believe that it would hinder rather than help the work of the Councilif the Corporation were obliged to follow a uniform consultationprocedure for changes over the whole of this great range, regardless of their importance.    They would naturally expect the corporation to make suitable working arrangements to keep the Council informed about all development in the field of charges and conditions.    Butthe legislation will impose an obligation on the Corporation to con-suit the Users&apos; Council only about proposals for major changes inthe charges or conditions for the main services.    It will providefor disagreements between Corporation and Council about interpretation of this provision to be referred to the Minister for decision.THE.POWERS OF THE CORPORATION25.  The Corporation will be equipped with the statutory powers,including the financial powers, it needs to run the Post office services which are to be transferred to It,  including the Giro.The Corporation will also be empowered to run a National data processing Service,,26&quot;   The Corporation will borrow long term exclusively from theMinister, and will be empowered to borrow temporarily from theMinister or with his consent from other persons.   The Treasury willbe able to guarantee short term borrowing from the banks under thisProvision.   Total outstanding borrowings in addition to the opening
capita^ debt will be given a specific limit.   As has been saidearlier, any increases in the total amount which the Corporation mayborrow will need to be approved by the House of Commons.27,  The Bill will confer various ancillary and general powers onthe Corporation, including power to manufacture anything used inconne&amp;tion with the exercise of its powers.   The Corporation willalso have power to form subsidiaries and to engage in joint under-takings with other organisations.    It will be expected to consult the Minister if it proposes to undertake on a large scale anymanufacturing work which the Post Office had not done previously.28.  The PMG&apos;s existing monopoly of the carriage of letters under thePost Office Act 1953 and his telecommunications monopoly under the telegraph Act 1869,  extend to the United Kingdom,  the Channel islands and the Isle of Man.    The Bill will confer on the Corporation acorresponding monopoly of the carriage of letters and,  in amodernised form, of telecommunications within the United Kingdom.The question of the continued application of the postal and tele-communications monopolies to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Manwill be discussed with the Insular Authorities in the Channel islands and with the Government of the Isle of Man.29.   The Postmaster General&apos; s existing telecommunications monopolyis generally speaking confined to communications between one person and another who is not the former&apos;s servant or agent.   The government do not intend that the Corporation should have a wider monopoly inthis respect^  so that the position of private networks operated atpresent outside the Postmaster General&apos;s monopoly will not beQffected.   The monopoly will not extend to broadcast transmissionsfrom radio stations direct to the general public.30&apos;   The Postmaster General&apos;s legal monopoly extends to inlandtelecommunications only, though in practice he is able to exertcertain controls over the activities of overseas telecommunicationsPerators in this country.    The Government have decided that subject8 -
to the limitations expressed in the preceding paragraph, theCorporation^ monopoly should extend, within the area of theUnited Kingdom (and - dependent upon the outcome of the negotiationsreferred to in para. 28 - the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man)to overseas telecommunications to, from and via that area.    Theyhave reached this conclusion because, with the rapid technologicaldevelopments that are taking place in this field, overseas and inlandtelecommunications systems are becoming increasingly integrated fromthe operational point of view.   Thus, for example, the InternationalSubscriber Dialling and national Subscriber Trunk Dialling networksare interdependent to the point, where,  to the user, they arevirtually one system.    The Government believe that in thesecircumstances it is right for the Corporations monopoly to extend to overseas telecommunications.31,   The Corporation will be empowered to grant licences under itsmonopolies,  subject to the consent of the Minister, and to chargeroyalties on them.    The reorganisation will not affect any vestedrights of the Corporation of Kingston-upon-Hull existing on vestingday to operate their own local telephone system, or other rightsthen existing under telegraph licences.    Nor will it mean that over-seas telecommunications operators   will lose any rights in thiscountry which they then have.    But the Corporations licence will berequired for any renewal of such rights,  and, for the operation of any new telecommunication facilities within its monopoly.PURCHASING POLICY32,   The Corporation will pay full regard to Government policy forpurchasing in the public sector.^ORGANISATION OF THE CORPORATION33*   Posts and Telecommunications are vast businesses in themselves?with different characteristics and meeting different needs.    Butthey have been run jointly by the Post Office in the past and arecomplementary in some- respects and interdependent in others.    Manyof their supporting functions are effectively and economically- 9 -
organised on a common service basis,,    There are thus real advantages in the continued overall direction of their affairs by a singlebody.   The Bill will therefore create a single statutory Corporationwhich will be headed by a single, small, largely executive board.3h0   At the same time,  if the two businesses are to developsuccessfully in their different ways and seize their differentopportunities, they must be managed separately within this single,overall framework.    The Government consider that the managerialstructure of the Corporation should provide for this at all levels - national, regional and local.35,   Traditionally the Post Office has followed the organisationalpattern of a central government department.    This pattern is not appropriate for the successful management of a large serviceindustry like the Post Office.   A fundamental examination of theorganisation is therefore now being carried out to see what changes are called for to fit it to the future needs of the Post Office,whatever its status.   Where appropriate,  changes will be implemented in advance of vesting day,36.   The nature of Post Office services,  as well as the sheer size of the business, calls for a system that devolves as much authority and responsibility as possible at every level.    The Corporation willbe expected to apply and develop this philosophy to meet the needsof the future.THQINISTER37.   As has been said, responsibility for the Corporation within theGovernment will be borne by the Minister who assumes those of thePostmaster General&apos;s functions (other than those in the Savingsfield) which are not taken over by the Corporation.    Certainstatutory powers of the Minister in relation to the Corporation,including his function in relation to the exercise of its licensingPower under its monopolies, have already been mentioned.- 10 -
Submissions to Her Majesty on behalf of the Corporation will bemade either by the Minister or, where appropriate, by the HomeSecretary.   The Minister will also have- the duty to appoint the Chairman and members of theCorporation.- the power to give such directions of a general nature tothe Corporation about the performance of its functions as appear to him to be required in the national interest,the power to give specific directions to the corporation in the interests of national security and in the field ofinternational relations.- the power to direct the Corporation to remedy any defect inits general plans and arrangements, which might be broughtto light by the Users1 Council or otherwise-- the power to direct the form of the Corporation&apos;s accounts and to appoint auditors.38.   The Corporation will settle the general lines of its capital development, with the approval of the Minister, and will be requiredto give him any information for which he might ask.39.   The Minister will assume the Postmaster General&apos;s presentfunctions in the field of Wireless Telegraphy under the wireless telegraphy Act 19U9) and his associated functions in the Broad-casting field.   This will include general,, regulatory control of radio transmission and reception, and the issue of licencesaccordingly.kO,   The Minister will also assume the Postmaster General&apos;responsibility for broadcasting policy, and his constitutionalfunctions in relation to the BBC under its Charter and Licenceand to the ITA under the Television Act 196k *g gnSgS- PROVIDED BY OTHER GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTShl*   The Post Office makes use of certain services provided byother Government Departments, primarily the Ministry of public buildings and Works and Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office. Since- 11 -
196I both the Post Office and the other Departments have been free to terminate or modify this relationship, subject to giving duenotice,,   This arrangement will continue when the Corporation isset upo   Because of the magnitude of the commitments involved on both sides, no action would be taken to end or modify the relationship except after adequate notice and full consultation.jwggRNATIONAL AND COMOIWEALTH RELATIONSh2.   The Corporation will be expected to have full regard to theGovernments policy in the field of international relations.International OrganisationsU3.   The Post Office has in the past played a leading part in the affairs of the Universal Postal Union and the InternationalTelecommunication Union and of other international organisationsin the posts, telecommunications and radio fields.    It has done so, either alone or with other Government Departments, where the participants are Governments, representing the United Kingdom.It has also done so where they are operational entities, as theUnited Kingdom operating agency in the field concerned.kk*   When the Corporation is set up,  the Government will ensurethat the United Kingdom remains an active member of the UniversalPostal and International Telecommunication Unions and of allother inter-governmental bodies with related purposes and willcontinue to be represented on these at Government level.    Where itis appropriate to designate an operating agency under the consti-tution of the international organisation concerned the corporation will be designated as the United Kingdom operating agency forposts and telecommunications (but not, of course, for broadcast-ing).   For example, it will become the communication entity forthe United Kingdom designated under Article II of the Agreementestablishing Interim Arrangements for a Global CommercialCommunications Satellites System (Cmnd. 21436).SSSBgnwealth Communications^5.   The United Kingdom has in the past had particularly closelinks with Commonwealth countries in communications matters.    The- 12 -
government will ens-are that the creation of the Corporationleads to no loosening of ties in this important respect.    Thearrangements for Commonwealth co-operation in the telecommunications-tions field are at present under review.    The Corporation willparticipate as an operating agency in whatever new machinery iscreated.pngTTION OF THE staff^6*   The Post Office employs over 1+00,000 Civil Servants,    Thegreat majority are in departmental grades which have no counter-parts in the rest of the Civil Service.    In addition there arenearly 23,000 sub-Postmasters, who undertake work for the PostOffice on a contractual basis.1)7.   The transfer of existing Post Office staff to the corporation will present a unique problem - first because of the number ofstaff involved and secondly because most of them are involved in providing essential services.lj.8.   It is essential that, apart from those in the SavingsDepartment,  these very large numbers of staff should be transferred from the Civil Service to the new Corporation when it is set up,so that it can continue to perform the services for which it willbe responsible.    The Government have given most anxious thought tothis problem and have reluctantly decided that it will not be practicable to offer the staff an option to choose either totransfer to the Corporation or to remain in the Civil Service,Nor will it be possible to second them to the Corporation for alimited period during which they can decide whether they wish toremain with the Corporation.k9o   Nevertheless, the Post Office is prepared to consider sympathetically ways and means of moving individuals into the savings Department,  the residual       Ministry or other GovernmentDepartments where there are suitable vacancies.    This must, ofcourse, be subject to the need to maintain the services.- 13 -
Consultation, has already begun with the staff asso&amp;iationsthe nature of certain assurances in the unique feircumstanaesundertakings on four issues which are of particular concern tothe staff *   These are:-Position up to Vesting DayBetween now and vesting day Post Office staff willcontinue to be Civil Servants and will be treated as such.Their pay will be determined on the same basis as thatapplicable in the Civil Service as a whole.    They will have recourse to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal in suitable cases.    They will have access to Civil Service Pay research and their pensions will remain non-contributory; and con-sultation will continue on the present basis.Conditions of service the Corporation is expected to begin negotiations as soonas it has been established on the conditions of service whichwill apply after vesting day.    To the extent that these arenot completed by that day for any group of staff, pay andconditions of service as they stood immediately prior tovesting day will continue to apply to the group until they havebeen varied by negotiations or, where&apos; applicable, arbitration.Security of TenureCivil Servants hold their positions at the pleasure ofthe Crown, and the Crown may dismiss them at pleasure.Nevertheless there is in practice,   subject to fitness and efficiency, a high degree of security of tenure forestablished Civil Servants.   When manpower demands havefallen, in particular sectors of the Post Office the practic-ability   of redeployment and, where necessary, the retrainingof those affected have been the subject   of full consultationwith the staff associations concerned.facing the staff who are being transferred to the Corporation.Inevitably there are many issues which have still to be discussed,,But the Government have already felt it appropriate to give- Ik -
The Government intend that the Corporation shall also,subject to manpower needs and to fitness and efficiency, givea high degree of security of tenure,  and that there shall, he noarbitrary system of hire and fire.,   Any problems arising fromreduced manpower demands shall as in the past be the subject of full consultation.    There will be discussions with the PostOffice (and thereafter the Corporation) on the arrangementsfor implementing this intention and the establishment of anappeals procedure for use in cases where an individual considershe has been unreasonably dismissed0    There is thus no reasonfor transferred staff to feel insecure - especially as thetotal manpower demands of the Corporation are likely toincrease.SuperannuationThe Corporation&apos;s superannuation arrangements will be thesubject of negotiation with the appropriate staff organisations.As with other nationalised industries, these arrangements willbe subject to approval by the responsible Minister.The aim will be a scheme which can be applicable both to staff transferred to the Corporation and to new entrants; but whatever the details of any new scheme, existing Civil Servantswill be entitled to opt instead to have the benefits they wouldhave enjoyed had they not been transferred from the CivilService.    In any case the Government will require theCorporation to ensure that all reckonable service before thetransfer took place is counted as reckonable service for thepurpose of the Corporation&apos;s arrangements.The Civil Service scheme will apply pending the introduc-ing of the Corporations new arrangements.The Corporation,  in negotiation with the staff, will be free to modify the initial superannuation arrangements in thelight of prevailing circumstances and subject to approval bythe responsible Minister.-- 15 -
- 16 -CONFIDENTIALynm RELATIONS51,   The Corporation will be judged by its success in providing services to the public imaginatively flexibly and efficiently.Managers at all levels will have a greater degree of personal responsibility for contributing to the right decisions and forseeing that they are carried out speedily and effectively,.    TheGovernment believe that this greater scope for initiative, and themore stringent requirements in assessing performance to which itleads, will be widely welcomed within the Post Office.52.   Without detriment to the responsibilities of managers to manage, the Government will expect the Corporation to promote themost constructive relationships between the management and thestaffo   The new Corporation will not be taking over an industrymarked by bad industrial relations: on the contrary, a fine tradi-tion of co-operation and consultation between the management and staff has been built up in the Post Office.    The Government willexpect the Corporation to ensure that this develops further in thenew conditions and to set the highest standards in relationships with the staff.    It would be premature to lay down in any detailwhat form the new machinery will take, since this must be deter-mined in discussions between the Corporation and the appropriatestaff organisations.   Nevertheless, the Bill will impose on theCorporation a duty to consult with the staff organisations on the setting up of machinery at all appropriate&quot; levels for negotiation and arbitration and for the promotion and encouragement of measures affecting the efficiency of the services and the safety, health,training and welfare of the staff.    The Government would, however,not wish any legal provisions on the subject to be regarded asrestrictive; rather should such provisions specify minimumarrangements on which the two sides should continue to build,developing the existing tradition.    The Government indeed believethat tho change in status presents an opportunity for developments
17 -in industrial democracy within the Corporation leading both to increasing the contribution of the staff to the efficient running of the services and to increasing the    satisfaction of the staffpith their conditions and place in the organisation.53,   It has been recognised by management and trade unions in thePost Office that past arrangements and attitudes have on occasiongiven rise to delays - sometimes but not always for reasonsoutside Post Office control - and the Governments intent ion is thatthe two sides, in discussions before vesting day,  should review their arrangements and approach to ensure that any weakness is removed.   This will be in the public interest and will be advantageous to management and staffs54,   The Government are convinced that if the contribution of thestaff is to be fully effective some rationalisation of the structure-ture of staff representation, accompanied by a reduction in thenumber of associations from the present figure of 20, would be helpful both in streamlining and speeding up joint machinery andin adaptation to the new organisation.    The changes associated withthe transformation of the Post Office may assist this processaCONCLUSION55&quot;   The services which the new Corporation will take over from thePostlOffice have an exciting future.   The technologies on which theydraw are advancing at unprecedented speed and economic and socialprogress will continually create new openings for their exploitation,,The changes set out in this White Paper are being made to meet thischallenge.   They will provide a context in which the spirit ofservice which has inspired the Post Office in the past can becarried forward successfully into the futureQ
