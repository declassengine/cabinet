f-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 5 COPY NO,11th January, 1967CABINETSTATISTICS OF IMPORTED MACHINERYMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade at the meeting of the Economic development Committee onJ . .5th January, it v/as suggested that the information required by the mechanical Engineering and Machine Tools Economic development committees (EDC) might be obtainable under the census or Board ofTrade licensing procedures or from the information collected in theadministration of investment grants.I The Statistics of Trade Act2.      Information of the sort which the EDCs are seeking could beobtained under the Statistics of Trade Act, 1947.     The non-disclosureprovisions of the Act would, however, prevent the passing on to non-Governmental bodies, including the EDCs, of information of a kind which revealed, the business of particular firms.     The powers underthis legislation would, therefore, be of no help in the present context.Investment grants3,      The claim forms at present used do not ask claimants to say whether the machinery is imported.     The name of the manufacturerhas to be given, and it would, therefore, be theoretically possible to identify imported machinery in a large number of cases.     Theinformation would not be complete, since the purchase of themachinery would not necessarily know whether the supplier hadimported the goods.     The extraction of the information from the 300, 000or so claims likely to be received each year would, however, be an extremely difficult operation.     Further, the description of themachinery will not be uniform, and will not be classified in the systematic way required by Customs and Excise,4.      The work involved in extraction could be reduced by requiringapplicants to state whether the machinery is imported.     To make theinformation of use to the EDCs, it would also be necessary to requireapplicants to give the catalogue numbers or some equally usefultechnical identifying particulars.    I do not think that we could complicate the administration of the system in this way.    Industry is critical ofthe amount of detail already required by the claims forms, and ministers have given the Confederation of British Industry an under-taking to keep the procedures as simple as possible.-1-CONFlBENTlAb
5,      There would be no statutory bar to making available to theEDCs any information collected in this way.     Since, however, theinformation would be used for a purpose other than the purpose of thelegislation under v/hich it was collected, the opinion of the attorney general referred to in paragraph 2 of the memorandum by the first secretary of State (C(67) 4) would apply, and it seems to me that in passing on the information the Board of Trade would therefore beultra vires.6.      In any event Ministers gave some very clear undertakingsabout non-disclosure during Committee Stage in the House of Commons,and I do not see how, in the light of these undertakings, we could makedetailed information from individual claim forms available to outside bodies such as the EDCs.Duty free licensing and import licensing7.      Statistics of imported machinery cannot be assembled fromBoard of Trade licensing procedures, since no licences are requiredfor imports of machinery from non-Communist sources.    some information has been available in the past based on applications for duty remission; but not only was this facility not available for80 per cent of machinery imports, but also directions were issuedoften well in advance or long after the time of import.    Moreover,so long as dury was remitted, a  3,000 mkkium value limit was imposed with the consequence that remission (i) did not apply to mostimports of, for example, portable power tools and of pumps whichwere not imported as parts of a complete machine and (ii) tended by contrast to bunch into the particular fields of expensive machinery,such as that for printing and textile production.    Duty remission was suspended on 30th September, 1966.. 8.      The legal position on making information under this headingavailable to the EDCs is the same as in the case of investment grants(see paragraph 5 above).conclusion.      It seems clear from the above that the information supplied,or which could be supplied, to the Board of Trade or other Departmentsunder any of the headings referred to above could not be used to supplement the information which Customs and Excise can supplyunder the proposed compromise solution.10.     It does seem to me that this information, which the EDCscould supplement by special enquiries addressed to users, should beof some real value for their import-saving work.     I fully understand the First Secretaryls wish that the Governroent should not appear tobe frustrating the EDCs in this work.    But I do not feel that weshould embark on fresh legislation without a more careful assessment of the real need for it and of the effect it might have on industry&apos;sco-operation in making information available voluntarily on the under-s tanding that this will not lead to any breach of confidence.D. P. T. J.Board of Trade, S. W. 1.10th January, 1967 -2-
