Tms DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of....\frrrr^../.r*rrrrTOP  secret copy NoC(67) 4031st March, 1967CABINETDEFENCE EXPENDITURE STUDIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for DefenceOur colleagues are aware (CC(66) 59th Conclusions, Minute 2)that a series of studies has been in progress designed to secure further large savings in defence expenditure by 1970-71,    A major reduction ofour forces was postulated, but still on the basis of no major change inour overseas policies,,    It is now clear that on this basis the maximumfurther savings on the defence budget which could be achieved by 1970^71would be about  1Q0- 125 million (these figures would increase by up to 25 million in subsequent years).2.       &quot;When these studies were started it was hoped to find furtherdefence savings of between  200 million and  300 million by 1970-71.These savings figures were arbitrary and not based on any detailedcalculations.    Nor did they take account of any offsetting expenditureon economic or defence aid that might be required,,    subsequent consideration of future public expenditure as a whole has emphasised the need to achieve the maximum possible saving on defence accountas a contribution to the reduction of the present planned programmes of public expenditure as a whole by  500 million in 1970-7103.      It is, therefore, plain that we must either accept a much smaller saving than had been hoped for on the Defence Budget or changeour oversea policies.    For the health of our economy we must changeour oversea policies,.    We suggest below how this could best be done andoutline what new policies v/e should seek to^adopts    We must, however,emphasise that the new policies if agreed by our colleagues will take time and effort to carry through, and will not then be easy to change.Room for Manoeuvre4.      The indications are that in the next few years our room for manoeuvre is limited mainly to our Far East deployment and commit -ments and to the consequential effects on the foreest facilities and stocks which we need to maintain in the United Kingdom,    Even in theFar East the pace at which we can proceed will be seriously affected bythe need not only to re-negotiate our commitments but also to avoid creating instability and so frustrate the achievement of the   savingswe wish to obtain.    In particular, Singapore&apos;s economy is highlydependent on the presence of British forces, which provide 20 to 25 percent of the Gross National Product and employ not far short of 10 percent of the local labour force against the background of a local unemploy-rnent figure of about 10 per cent.-1-TOP  SECRET
TOP SECRETPolit ic o / M ilitary Strategy;5.      In the light of the studies carried out we consider that itv/ill be necessary for us to withdraw British forces from singapore and Malaysia and to maintain a minimum military presence withmaritime and air forces based in Australia.6.     We shall have to consult our Allies about this proposal^notably Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Singapore and malaysia.    Withdrawal from Singapore and Malaysia would have tobe phased over a number of years? our aim would be to try andreach the half-way mark by 1970-71 and to be completely out by1975-76., though we should not px*eclude the possibility of an earlierwithdrawal if political events made this feasible.    We should offer,if necessary, to maintain a small maritime and air presence., on anunaccompanied basis in Australia, using Australian facilities once we have withdrawn from Singapore and Malaysia.C omm itm ent s7.      This new approach will involve major re- negotiations of our commitments.    Soon after 1970-71 we should no longer have any land forces in the Far East (apart from Kong Kong) and we must therefore re-negotiate our Treaty obligations to Malaysia and singapore and our force declarations to the South East Asia treaty organisation.    We should have to re-negotiate our agreement withBrunei.    We could no longer contribute our land forces to theCommonwealth Brigade,, but we could contribute maritime and airforces to a Commonwealth Strategic Force.    Apart from thepolitical and military changes in commitmentsf the economic consequences in the area as a whole would be considerable and in singapore could be grave.Defence Savings8.     It is not possible at this stage to give precise figures of the likely savings in the Defence Budget; but the Defence Secretarybelieves that, if adopted now, the defence savings that should resultby 1970-71 would, as a preliminary estimate, be in the region of 15 0 million to  200 million and up to   300 million by 1975-76.It will take some time to work out the full implications, not leastbecause of the need to assess the effects on the forces we maintain in the United Kingdom.     The urgent need is for the process of consultation to start so that an early start can be made in achievingdefence savings.Aid Implications9.      The defence savings take no account of the expenditure on aidwhich would be necessary to help mitigate the consequences of our withdrawal  torn. Singapore and Malaysia,    Some increase in the aidbudget will be needed to alleviate the ec economic difficuliles,particularly in Singapore where they seem likely to be more severethan Malta.    The full implications cannot be assessed beforeconsultation starts.-2-
Foreign Office, S. W. 1.31st March, 1967-3-C onsultation10.     It will be difficult to carry our partners with us in this new approach and to get them to accept the major consequences in termsof reduced military capability, re-negotiated commitments, andeconomic changes.     Nevertheless, we believe it is essential to do so.Timing and Tactics11.     A principal difficulty in giving effect to the new approach lies in choosing the right combination of timing and tactics,,    On the onehand, in order to make sense of long term planning some firmassumptions are needed.    But on the other, flexibility is required ifwe are to get the maximum political advantage out of the proposed policy.    It may well be that outside politica.1 events, in particular aVietnam settlement, will eventually make things easier for us v/ithour allies.    We must ensure that neither our planning nor our public statements commit us so rigidly that we find ourselves unable to advance the date of our final departure from Singapore and Malaysiaif this later proves to be possible.    In any public statement we maymake, we should be careful to avoid naming dates so as to leave themaximum room for manoeuvre.    In carrying out further work weshall study carefully the possibilities of making our final withdrawalat a date earlier than 1975-76.12.     Jf this approach is acceptable to our colleagues, we proposeto start forthwith a series of consultations with our friends and Alliesconcerned on the Hn.es we have indicated but without prejudice to final decisions which must be taken in the middle of this year.Conclusion13.     We recommend that our colleagues agree to the new approachoutlined in this paper.G. B.D. W. H.
