The Torrey Canyon was a tanker of 118,285 tons dead weight owned bythe Barracuda Tanker Corporation, a subsidiary of the Union Oil company of California, and registered in Liberia. She was on charter to the british petroleum Company Limited and carried oil in all but two of her 18 tanks.She was insured for a total of  5 m., one third of the insurance being carried in London, mostly by Lloyd&apos;s, and the remainder in the United States ofAmerica. She carried a crew of 36.
THE &quot;TORREY CANYON&quot;I. SummaryAt, 0930 hours on, Saturday 18th March 1967 the Torrey Canyon was reported aground on the Seven Stones reef between the Isles of Stilly andLands End. She was bound for Milford Haven with a cargo of 120,000tons of Kuwait crude oil, and it is believed that she struck the reef whentravelling at about 17 knots.Within an hour a Royal Navy helicopter was over the ship. But the heavyswell in the area during the first two or three days made it hazardous.toget any other craft alongside in order to carry out an inspection, whichwould have involved the transfer of equipment. On 20th March, when theChief Salvage Officer of the Navy Department joined the salvage crew (ofthe Bureau Wijksmuller) on the ship, it became clear that many of the18 cargo tanks were damaged and that an estimated 30,000 tons of oil hadspilled into the sea.The threat of oil pollution was evidently on a scale which had noprecedent anywhere in the world. Without waiting for an assessment of damage, ships of the Royal Navy on the afternoon of 18th March begana continuous operation of spraying detergent in order to disperse the oil which had escaped ; and they were later assisted by chartered commercialvessels. Large-scale preparations to deal with oil pollution on the beacheswere also put in hand.From their first visit to the ship on 20th March representatives of theNavy Department offered to provide all possible assistance. This included a detailed hydrographical survey of the reef around the ship, heavy lifts byhelicopters from the salvage vessels to the ship and the continuous ferryingof salvage personnel. But weather conditions began to deteriorate on 24thMarch and a change in wind direction on 25th March brought oil for thefirst time to Cornish beaches ; 100 miles of coastline between Perranporthand The Lizard were affected. On the evening of 26th March high seas and strong winds caused the ship to break her back, releasing possibly a further30,000 tons of crude oil into the sea. On 27th March the government decided that all hope of minimising pollution through towing away theship or any part of her must be abandoned ; and the following day theship was bombed by aircraft of the Royal &apos;Navy and the R.A.F. in orderto set on fire the oil remaining in her.Subsequent paragraphs of this paper describe the action taken so far onthe Governments behalf and indicate how the Government propose todeal with the continuing threat of oil pollution from the Torrey Canyonand with the general questions prompted by this disaster.II. The shipThe overriding concern of the Government throughout has been to preserve the coasts from oil pollution and to adopt the course most likely to achieve this end irrespective of legal or financial considerations based onliabilities under international law.
There were three possible methods of disposing of the oil within theship. First, to pump the oil out into other vessels. Secondly, to refloat theship,and to tow her away, with as much as possible of her cargo within her,as quickly and safely as posible. Thirdly, to burn the oil in the shipwhere, she had grounded.Pumping the oil out. The difficulty about the first course was that, owingto the danger of explosion, it was impracticable to install on board thegenerating equipment which would have been required to push the oil out.There was constant danger of a major explosion in view of the quantity of oil which had escaped, the presence of gas under pressure, and the poundingof the ship on the rocks. The chief salvage officer of the Dutch salvageteam died, and other members of the team were injured, as the resultof an explosion which took place on 21st March. The alternative courseof having a small pumping ship standing off the Torrey Canyon and feedinginto another tanker standing off in safer waters would have been prolonged and extremely hazardous even in calm conditions, and was quite imprac-ticable in the conditions which prevailed.Refloating the ship. The salvors hoped to refloat the ship. Although shewas extensively holed, she retained a certain amount of buoyancy becausethe decks were completely sealed and the oil remaining in the tanks, beinglighter than sea water, was for the most part held in position by the pressure of the water below and the strength of the deck above. Thesalvors intended to increase this buoyancy by pumping compressed air intothe tanks.Until the ship broke up the best professional advice available to theGovernment was that, although the chances of refloating were not as high as the salvors believed, this course still held possibilities of success. Inthis respect the interests of the Government and of the salvors coincided.Whether those interests would diverge at a later stage if the ship were successfully refloated was another matter ; and since it seemed likely thatthe salvors would in the first place wish to bring the ship to some safeanchorage in the West Country or elsewhere in the British Isles, and mightthereafter wish to tow her to a port in the United Kingdom, the government made it clear to all concerned that they would not allow the ship to enterBritish territorial waters. The right of the Government to refuse admission to territorial waters was not questioned.The possibility of cutting the ship, and towing away part, with oil stillin that part, was considered. But this operation would have involved thedifficulty of getting heavy equipment to the ship and a great risk ofexplosion, and had to be ruled out as impracticable.  ,Had the attempt to refloat the Torrey Canyon been successful, theGovernment were determined that the course taken by the tow shouldminimise the risk of further pollution. Their view was that the best coursewould have been to tow the ship into mid-Atlantic, if possible beyondfishing grounds and the influence of the Gulf Stream, and to sink her.They were prepared to buy out the salvors in order to ensure that theywould have complete control over the ship immediately she was refloated.The worsening weather brought this prospect to an end.
Setting, the oil, on fire. The possibility, of seeking to destroy the oil by setting it on fire was considered from the outset. But it was decided tohold this course in reserve, for three reasons. First, the solution of towingthe&quot;, ship away, if that proved practicable, was clearly better. Secondly,such previous experience as could be drawn upon was not encouraging ; a tanker which caught fire in the Persian Gulf burnt for over two months and only a little more than half the oil cargo was consumed, leaving anobnoxious tarry residue. There was a serious risk that, so long as the shipremained whole, an attempt to set the oil on fire might be only partiallysuccessful; and might indeed increase . the risk of pollution instead ofeliminating it. Thirdly, a problem on this scale was without precedence ;and exploring possible means of opening the deck of the tanker, exposingthe oil to the atmosphere, and setting it alight, was bound to take sometimex     ^:yy?;b 6r:kih ;iQ(V. Jxwikikc &amp;k--:%Investigations on this last point were however urgently proceeding,under the general direction of the Government^ Chief Scientific Adviser.To tackle the problem on board would have involved a delicate piece of explosive surgery on the deck. Large charges&apos; would have had to beplaced to weaken the deck at selected points and to explode immediately before the explosion of larger charges which would have been&apos; insertedinto the tanks. This would have been a most hazardous undertaking,which could have been carried out only during a spell of favourable weather. Experiments held but greater hopes of being able to fire the oilon the sea. One thousand gallons of Kuwait oil was discharged on to a lake,artificial wind and waves were created and the oil set on fire by &quot; bombs &quot;.All but 1 per cent, of the oil was destroyed. In the light of this experimentthe necessary sodium chlorate &quot; bombs &quot; were tested for firing crude oiland sent to Cornwall, to be held in readiness, on the afternoon of Monday,27th March. ;- i - &apos;A considerable change in circumstances had meanwhile taken place.Up to the afternoon of 26th March the attempts to refloat the ship werebeing pressed forward, and not without hopes of success. But the weather was further deteriorating, and on the evening : Of that day the ship began to break up. This created a new situation in Which the chances of getting the ship away diminished almost to vanishing point. There was still some slight possibility of towing off a section of the ship, but this possibilitydisappeared during the following morning.On the evening of Monday 27th March the Government decided toattempt to destroy the remaining cargo byopening the deck over each tankby HE bombs and setting fire to the oil,On the morning of Tuesday 28th March, all shipping in the area waswarned, and the owners of the ship were informed of.-the &apos; government&apos;s decision.. In a series of strikes, the covers of the tanks in the ship whichhad remained intact were opened by bombs dropped by R.N. Buccaneersand aircraft of the R.A.F. in order to . release the oil to set it on fire.Incendiary sodium chlorate &quot; bombs &quot; were dropped by R.N. helicopters,and napalm and petrol by the R.A.F., to ensure that all the released oilwas burnt. The purpose of the bombing, it.should be emphasised, was notto sink.and destroy the vessel, but, to open up what remained of the cargotanks and to burn the oil in them. .
The fire had to be rekindled by subsequent strikes ; and practically allthe oil in the wreck and in the immediate vicinity was, it is believed,destroyed by 30th March.III.   Oil at SeaEven if it had been possible to contain the oil remaining in the ship and destroy it in or close to the vessel, extensive pollution would havebeen inevitable because of the spilling-out on impact, both in the sea andalong the coastline of South-West England. Quite apart, therefore, from themeasures which were taken to dispose of the Torrey Canyon and herremaining cargo, immediate measures were taken to deal with the oil which escaped from the ship.Four hours after the Torrey Canyon ran aground, ships of the royal navy were on their way from Plymouth with detergent. This was sprayedon to the oil floating on the surface in order to emulsify and disperse it.The operation was continued and extended during the days which followed and commercial vessels were chartered in addition to ships of the royal navy. The operation has effectively dispersed large quantities of oil andis now being concentrated on areas close inshore.Other possible ways of dealing with oil at sea were investigated. they include absorbing the oil with materials such as tanners&apos; waste andvermiculite, which would coagulate the oil and remain on the surface ; and sinking the oil by coagulation with particulate matter such as fuller&apos;s earth,fly ash, sand or cement. The possibilities of coagulation on the surfaceare still being tested, but sinking the oil has been rejected, at any ratefor the time being, because oil carried to the bottom of the sea may laterbe released. Fishing grounds are extensive in the affected areas, and carry-ring the oil to the sea-bed might be more harmful than allowing it tomove on the surface.Some ideas which have been put forward, such as the treatment of oilslicks with carbon tetrachloride or other chlorinated solvents, would create a situation more dangerous than the one which already exists because ofthe toxicity of the agents proposed.Booms are being placed in the mouths of suitable harbours, bays, inletsand estuaries. The Government made plans to contain the oil in theneighbourhood of the ship by means of a boom of expandable neopreneblocks. But it proved out of the question to use it in the weather which prevailed by the time the blocks were available on 28th March. This boomwas subsequently erected across part of the mouth of the Fal. A consider-able number of other booms have also been constructed with great speed.Work on the development of boom protection is being supervised by aspecial Group at Plymouth consisting of naval and civilian experts. Adviceis being provided to local authorities and harbour interests on the designsof booms which are best suited to particular local conditions.Mechanical methods for removing the oil from the surface of the seaare being used where local conditions allow, including the seaward side ofbOom defences. They include sucking the oil from the surface in dredges,and sucking the oil mixed with sea water from the surface and subsequentlyseparating the two. These methods require the use of gravel dredges fitted with special pumps.
IV. Oil on the coastsThe measures taken by the Government prevented a great deal of oil from reaching the coast but in view of the amount discharged on the initialimpact some oil, as was inevitable, was driven on to the beaches. The oilbegan to arrive on Saturday 25th March and more must be expected toreach the coast in the weeks to come.The Government took immediate action to assist with advice the localauthorities principally affected. On 19th and 20th March administrative and technical officers from the Ministry of Housing and Local Governmentwent to Plymouth. Meetings took place with the Cornish authorities during20th-22nd March and a memorandum of guidance was distributed to them on 22nd March. Since then, advisory staff has been built up at Plymouthand at the main centres along the coast.Policy and advice for dealing rapidly with the situation which is sub-stantially affected by the weather and the chemical action of sea water uponthe oil must be flexible. Immediately, the local authorities were affordeddemonstrations of beach cleaning methods, that is by the spraying of deter-gent shortly before the tide comes up and by hosing the beach subse-quently. Local authorities have been instructed in other methods oftreatment: for example, bulldozing the oil into lumps of critical size whichcan then be burnt either on their own or with the help of additives, andin giving effect to these various methods they have had advice from Head-quarters at Truro and Plymouth as well as large scale assistance from theArmy.Experiments are continuing about the best method of dealing with rockycoves and with beaches which are heavily contaminated and of preventing the contamination of mud flats or saltings.V. Danger to marine and wild-life : and air pollutionThe Government are advised that deep water fishing will not be affected,nor will there be any health hazard through eating the fish. Detergent may affect plankton in areas which have been heavily treated, but these effectswill be local and confined to surface waters. In shallow and estuarial water,oil, and perhaps detergent, could affect shell fish ; some oysters have been moved from their present beds to tanks and other grounds, and booms arebeing erected to protect creeks carrying oysters.The Government have established liaison with national and local organi-sations responsible for the conservation and protection of wild life, suchas the Nature Conservancy, the Council for Nature, the Royal Society forthe Protection of Birds, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the royal society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and are keeping in close touch with fishery interests. Measures to deal with birds affected byoil are being co-ordinated by the R.S.P.C.A. It may be necessary to movesmall populations of specially rare species. Some areas important forwild-life will be protected by booms.Monitoring arrangements have been made so that any air pollutiondue to burning of oil will be quickly detected.

VI   Administration    ..(. . t ;&quot;-^IhlSi&amp;iVe-&apos;-&quot; study &apos;of&apos; all the possible means of preventing and mitigatingpollution&apos;/ &quot;and applying the. remedies recommended in the varying circum-stances;-&apos;-ovf&apos;--beacheg:along-a-deeply-indented coastline, has involved.a large-scalecombined operation. In the initial phase, the lead was; taken by theRoyal Navy, and the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for defence for the Royal Navy was sent to Plymouth on Sunday 19th March, as were a&quot; number of officials from the Departments most closely involved.In the light of Mr. Foley&apos;s report Ministers that evening authorised an initial expenditure of up to  ^m., without prejudice to any ultimate finan-cial arrangements, in order that there.should be no delay in building upthe work of oil clearance. Mr. Foley&apos;s task was to supervise arrangementsfor offshore work and for the procurement of detergent and other materials and equipment. The two Other Services were rapidly called upon to assistand a pattern of co-operation with the local authorities was evolved forCornwall and Devon which has subsequently been extended throughout the counties along the south coast.A Working Party of expert scientists, under the Governments ChiefScientific Adviser, were set.up to consider the scientific problems involved:removal of;any oil left in the wreck ; destruction or dispersal of the escapedoil at sea : prevention of the oil reaching beaches, harbours and estuaries ;removal of oil from beaches and harbours ; and reduction of the biologicalhazards to marine, shore and bird life from both oil and detergent. TheWorking Party sought advice from other expertshad experiments carriedout by Government and industrial laboratories ; and screened numeroussuggested methods to deal with the individual problems.Local Headquarters have been established at Plymouth, with sub-officesat Truro and Exeter, to co-ordinate activity in Devon and Cornwall; at portsmouth for Dorset, Hampshire, Somerset and Gloucestershire ; and atFolkestone for Kent and Sussex; Each of these local Headquarters is inthe charge of a Minister from the Ministry of Housing and Local Govern-ment, and the Minister of Housing, who is himself based on Plymouth, isin command on the spot.Jersey and Guernsey are represented at the Portsmouth Headquarters,and men and materials are being sent from the mainland to the channel islands. Early warning arrangements have been made with the local autho-rities on the coast of South Wales and the same general pattern of co-operation has been built up as on the south coast of England.A prominent feature in all parts of the threatened areas has been the readiness with which private people and local organisations of all kindshave contributed resources in labour, materials and equipment. Thearrarigements which were so swiftly made for the production and transportof detergent and other materials required a massive co-operative effort,which was maintained and developed even in the difficult conditions created by the bank holiday week-end.The main brunt of dealing with the oil pollution on shore is falling uponthe local authorities and they have shown both quickness and efficiency in&apos;dealing with the mess. Despite the help which they have received fromthe Government some of them could not have carried out the wide range
of extra work required without incurring crippling rate burdens. In addition,therefore, to other forms of direct help the Government are providingfinancial assistance through the following methods. Local authorities. arenot being asked to contribute towards the cost of detergents or towards theexpense of troops used for clearance work. Moreover, Exchequer grantwill be payable to local authorities to meet 75 per cent, of any additional expenditure reasonably incurred on actual clearance or on preventivemeasures. The Government have also announced that if, after the paymentof this grant, authorities are left with a burden in excess of the product ofa 2d. rate, additional grant will be paid.The Government acknowledges the offers of assistance which have beenreceived from all parts of the world and are particularly grateful for offersmade by the President of the United States Administration., Men andequipment generously provided by the United States Third Air Force arenow working on some south coast beaches.It is hoped that the funds available to the voluntary bodies concernedwith the preservation of wild life can be augmented by contributions whichhave been offered by many private people at home and abroad. It is not practicable to make use of all offers of assistance but a register of volun-teers is being kept, and every effort will be made to take advantage of theservices offered.A team of French naval officers visited Plymouth on 24th March, offeredassistance and discussed the methods being used to deal with the oil both at sea and on shore. Since then, the French authorities have receiveddaily situation reports.VII.  The futureNo balance sheet can at present be drawn up. Even the direct costs which have been incurred on Government account, mainly by the Ministryof Defence, cannot be identified whilst urgent operations continue. It willalso be some time before the charges falling to local authorities and grant-aided from the Exchequer can be calculated. It is not likely to be possibleto make an accurate estimate of losses already sustained by private interestsof one kind and another ; but present indications are that the scale of damage still in prospect is likely to be less daunting than at one time was feared.The Government are re-examining the problems which may arise fromthe carriage of hazardous cargoes in or through waters where any accidentmay affect British interests. This will include an evaluation of the methods which have been used in relation to the Torrey Canyon and also of many other suggestions which this particular disaster has brought to notice.The Government are now considering the lessons to be drawn in respectof national and international law and practice from the Torrey Canyonincident. They have taken the initiative in convening an early meeting ofthe Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation to consider what changes are now required in international maritime law and practice: TheGovernment believe this to be the best means of bringing ships carrying oil
under closer control with a view to safeguarding coastlines and marine lifeagainst the increasing risk of large-scale accidents involving pollution. Thelaw relating to international shipping is highly complex and in a number ofrespects quite out of date. Formulation of proposals to improve its condi-tion will be pressed forward with urgency.
