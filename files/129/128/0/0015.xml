IiPTRODTJCTIOI.Control of the Defence Budget1.     The main purpose of the Defence Review was tobring defence expenditure into balance with thenation&apos;s resources.    The planned estimates for 1969-70were cut by  400m or 16$, bringing them down to the196U level of  2000m at constant prices.    The estimates for 1967-8 will be  72m below;    those for 1966-7 were 28m below;    the out-turn for 1965-6 was  23m below.Over  these three years, the Government has saved 750m on the programme it inherit eel.Relief of over-stretch2.      The second major aim of the Defence Review was toreduce the overstretch of our forces.    This is nowbeing achieved.    In 1966, the number of men in theArmy sent abroad on emergency tours was one-third lessthan in 1965.    By 1st April 1968? we plan that about25.000 men and 6,000 Service families will have beenbrought back to the United Kingdom from outside Europe.Further relaxations of overstretch will follow fromthe redeployment of our forces.Reductions in overseas expenditure3.      A third aim of the Defence Review was to cut thecost of defence in foreign exchange.    By the end of1967-8 net overseas expenditure will be running at about  75m below the estimated net expenditure in1966-7.    Details are in Annex Ii.    This will beachieved much sooner   than originally planned because,in the light of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement on20th July 1966, we are bringing forces home up to18 months earlier than envisaged in the Defence Review.A.o  o  u o
CONFIDENTIAL- 3 -h.      The Defence Review of I966 was not intended to providea definitive answer to Britain&apos;s defence problems.     As wesaid at the time in Cmnd 2901,  &quot;We have always recognisedthat the defence review must be a continuing process and apermanent part of our policy-making&apos;!:.      It is now normal practice to examine defence programmes on a 10-year .basis;and this work has to reflect the developments and eventsboth in the international situation and our own.economic position.In particular, the scale of our overseas expenditure on defence requires an unremitting watch.     We are, therefore,continuing to study the scope that exists for reducing our foreign exchange expenditure throughout the world, always witha proper regard to the interests of our allies and our ability to meet our commitments.     The cost of stationingour forces in Germany poses a special problem.      Since lastyear,  the difficulties of meeting the foreign exchangeexpenditure here have increased.     NATO Is essential to our security-    and we must continue to make a worthwhile military contribution to the strength of the Alliance.      But theforeign exchange problem has added urgency to the reappraisalof NATO strategy described in this Chapter.      It has alsocompelled the Government to re-examine the political,  economicand military implications of of our deployment outside Europe.Two major international developments of the last 12 months have been&apos; critical for these tasks:    the situation created by the French Government&apos;s withdrawal from integration in nato;    and the decision of the Indonesian Government to endits policy of confrontation against Malaysia.Disarmament. Jincl Arms ControlUa,   The Government remains committed to its policy ofworking towards general and complete disarmament as stated in&quot;the 1966 Defence White Paper.     This is being pursued In all/ways

Ever since October 196U, the British Government hasargued inside NATO that allied strategy must be designedto fit the forces which, the national governments are preparedthat none of the NATO governments is prepared to pay for theforces which SAC EUR would, need to carry out his mission as hitherto defined..      Uncertainty about the war-time role ofFrench forces further reduces the strength which NATO can rely on.      At their meeting in July 1966?  the NATO defence ministers finally agreed to instruct their military advisers to revise NATO strategy in the light of the forces which governments would undertake to make available on a rollingfive year programme, while retaining the commitment   .to the forward defence of the NATO area.      Since then discussions havebeen held in the Defence Planning Committee of the north atlantic Council, particularly about the political guidancewhich governments should give to their military staffs.Foreign Exchange Burden6,     The disproportionate foreign exchange cost imposed onthe American and British Governments by the stationing of forces in Germany has led to tripartite discussions betweenthem and the German Government, at which the Secretary-General of NATO is represented.      Owing to changes in theGerman Government and the inherent difficulty of the problem,to make available.It has been aipparent for many years/conclusions
- 5 -conclusions could not be reached &quot;by the time of the meetingof the North Atlantic Council in December 1966.     TheBritish Government has agreed to make no changes in the troopor supply dispositions of its forces in Germany, which would affect their combat capability, before 1st July 1967.Meanwhile,  it will do its utmost to promote agreement amongthe Allies about the changes required in NATO strategy. ^J:g^!j g-.-q?-.-&apos;one Threat7.     The Government &quot;believes that NATO cannot produce astrategy appropriate to the real threat facing western europe, unless it takes into account the political intentions as well as the military capability of the Soviet Union andthe other.Warsaw Pact powers.      The starting point of anyenquiry -must, therefore, be to consider how the threat has changed since NATO was set up,  and why.      The AlliedGovernments recognise, by their actions no less than &quot;by theirpublic statements,  that tension in Europe has relaxed and thatthere is little danger of aggression at present.      InDecember 1966 at the North Atlantic Council,  they confirmedtheir intention to continue their efforts to secure &quot;better relations with the Soviet Union and the States of eastern europe in the political,  economic,  social,  scientific and cultural fields&quot;. .   The British Government believes that both the political and military furthering of the detentewould best he achieved by mutual reduction of the forcesof NATO and Warsaw Pact Powers.      This measure of armscontrol, besides giving both sides greater security, would create a better climate in which to approach the major political problems of the European Continent and wouldliberate resources for the economy.
8.      Whether or not this is possible in the immediatefuture NATO can, for many reasons,  take a more confidentview of Soviet intentions in 1967 than in 191+9 or 1956.Soviet society has undergone important political and economicchanges.      China has become a factor which the SovietGovernment cannot ignore.      And the continuing strengthof NATO has had a decisive effect.9.      Even though the NATO Governments have not attempted toprovide all the forces judged necessary to fulfil SACBUR1smission,  as originally defined,  the Alliance has succeeded indeterring attack.      It is recognised that aggression at anylevel will always he met by an appropriate military response.The size of NATO1s conventional forces is not the only factorto be considered.      Besides the overwhelming strategic nuclear forces which the United States maintains outside the nato preventive,  there are several thousand nuclear weaponsavailable to the Alliance in Europe Itself.      It is difficultto believe that any rational government;, knowing these facts,would reckon to achieve by the use of force against western europe any political objective whose value would be remotelycommensurate with the appalling risks.10.    Even so,  it is sometimes argued that NATO might have to face a large-scale attack as a result of accident or miscal-speculation.     Yet attack by accident except at the lowest levelof military force,  is highly Improbable.      Large-scale attack by miscalculation is no more likely.      It is notperhaps inconceivable that, because of some fundamental change in the world situation,   the threat to Western Europemight revive.      But,  such a change is most unlikely todevelop overnight./Strategic
- 7 -S t r a t e g;ic, JEm1 - i%2 ^2BM.11.    We are discussing with our allies the possible strategicimplications of this political assessment.      Since politicalindications pre likely to give some warning of potentialaggression,  it may Toe possible to consider holding some ofthe forces which NATO would require if war were threatened,outside the area where they would then be deployed.Improvements both in the capability of transport aircraft,and in the air-portability of much military equipment, can beexpected to reduce the time required to redeploy such forces to the threatened area in a crisis.     Thus one way in which germany&apos;s allies might be able to save foreign exchange wouldbe to reduce the level of forces they maintain on Germansoil in normal circumstances.12.    not!s strategic posture must take account of the nature and duration of military operations in Europe should the deterrent fail.      Unless they greatly increase their presentforces,  the allies could not fight a long war in western europe.     At present, however, NATO Governments are expectedto maintain stocks of ammunition and other supplies in western europe to cover a period of conflict in excess of what theircombat forces could sustain.      By bringing logistic sup-portmore into balance with the capability of combat forces,  savings could be made in both resources and foreign exchange.13.    Similar considerations point to a revision of not&apos;smaritime strategy as well.      NATO must be ready at sea,  aswell as on land,  to demonstrate its will and its ability to respond appropriately to any act of aggression.      But it isno longer realistic for the Alliance to attempt to providemaritime forces for conducting a prolonged war at sea after a strategic nuclear exchange.     Deterrence must be the firstpurpose of NATO&apos;s naval forces too./Nggc lear
- 8 -Nuclear JVeajojon^Pjba^1U.    Those members of NATO who do not possess nuclear weapons must he able to satisfy themselves that the decisionon how and when the Alliance should use nuclear weaponswould be taken in accordance with the interests and wishes of the Alliance as a whole.      No arrangements should however be made which conflict with ou? policy of preventing thefurther spread of nuclear weapons.      To associate allied nationals with the physical operation of the weapons them-selves offers no solution to the problem.     The problem is how Governments take the political decision on their use.In a crisis, the allied governments must be ahle to remaincontinuously in communication with one another and to reachcollective decisions on the basis of accurate information asto what is happening,  in accordance with principles for theemployment of nuclear weapons agreed in- advance.15.    By concentrating its attention on these issues, theSpecial Committee of Defence Ministers has made more progress on the nuclear problems of the Alliance in 12 months than inthe preceding 17 years.     The British Government has played a leading role in this work.     At its meeting in December1966s  the Defence Planning Committee of the North atlantic council agreed to establish a permanent Nuclear DefenceAffairs Committee and a Nuclear Planning Group as part ofits normal machinery to pixrsue these questions further.The next stage .....
The Next Stage16.    The Government hopes that, by the end of June 1967,allied discussions on the revision of NATO strategy willhave produced broad agreement on the size, composition,deployment and military role of the forces required, andon a fairer sharing of the economic burdens they impose.As the G-overnment has made clear, means must he found of meeting the foreign exchange cost of our forces in Germany.It may,  therefore, be necessary for the Government to take further steps, consistent with the prescribed NATO and WEDprocedures, to relieve the United Kingdom of the foreign exchange burden which remains.     Accommodation is now being prepared in Britain in case it proves necessary to reducethe level of our forces in Germany.17.    Meanwhile,  to save foreign exchange, changes are beingmade in the administration and support of the British forcesin Germany which do not affect their combat capability.Preparations are being made for diverting more of theirconsumer spending to British goods and organisations.REDEPLOYMENT OF FORCES____.
f22 o   00009- 10 -REDEPLOYMENT OP FORCESSouth East Asia after &quot;confrontation&quot;18.   The Governments of Malaysia and Indonesia ratified theBangkok Agreement in August 1966 and agreed to seek &quot;close and friendly relations&apos;.    &quot;Confrontation&quot; was at an end.19.   It is still too early to make firm assumptions aboutthe political pattern of South East Asia in the 1970s;but there is much to learn from the arduous three years&apos;campaign against &quot;confrontation&quot; to which British forces madea decisive contribution..     The Brigade of Gurkhas played an outstanding part throughout the campaign.20o    Some of the main features of the campaign are described in Chapter II.     It was a fine example of what british forces can do outside Europe to maintain internationalstability.     Without their contribution to the Commonwealtheffort, much of South East Asia might have collapsedinto disorder, perhaps inviting competitive intervention by other powers with the consequent risk of general war.21.   Despite the vast area involved, and the number and variety of the forces available to the two sides,operations throughout were under the strictest politicaland military control.     Confrontation ws.a never allowedto escalate above the level of local conflict.Comparatively few lives were lost.
- 11 -22.    The campaign, on two fronts over 1000 miles apart,was a model of inter-Service and inter-Allied cooperation.Commonwealth Naval and Air forces controlled over 3000 miles of coastline and the air space above it, while ground forces were able to dominate a thousand miles of jungle frontier inBorneo for three years against guerilla, action by hostileforces, which were always superior in numbers.23.    This achievement would not have been possible if theCommonwealth troops - British, Australian and New Zealand inaddition to those of Malaysia and Singapore - had not won and held the confidence of the local inhabitants, many of whom had lived until then with little or no contact with thetwentieth century.    The &quot;hearts and minds&quot; campaign was ascritical to Commonwealth success in containing the conflictas the continuous jungle patrols and the system of helicoptersupply.    Lasting lessons have been learnt about the use ofmilitary forces to help people in their everyday lives,2k.    Our aim is that Britain should not again have toundertake operations on this scale outside Europe.    Thepurpose of our diplomacy is to foster developments which willenable the local peoples to live at peace without the presenceof external forces.    But the continuing presence, wherever they are welcome to those peoples, of British forces can help to create an environment in which local governments are able to establish the political and economic basis for peace and stability.    There can also be no/certainty ....*
- 12 -certainty - so long as threats to stability remain - thatthose forces will not be required to give help to friendlyGovernments0 or to play a part in a UN peace-keeping force,as they have done in recent years.25o   We are continuing discussions with the australian government about the possibility of having new facilities in Australia.   We are also examining what benefits we would get from a new staging airfield in the British Indian OceanTerritories.    These arrangements will offer us the prospectof greater freedom of manoeuvre in our future defence planningparticularly in relation to the Far East.26.    The withdrawal of our forces from Eastern Malaysiabegan as soon as the Bangkok Agreement was announced.It is now almost complete.    The only British forces remainingthere are small parties removing or disposing of stores whowill be leaving soon; a survey troop carrying out militarymapping there for some months; and a&apos; few helicopters whichare temporarily helping the Malaysian armed forces to supplytheir detachments in remoter areas.27c    The return of units to the United Kingdom began as soonas the end of &quot;confrontation&quot; was confirmed.    These were mainly operational units of the Army and Eoyal Mr Force,totalling about 10,000 men; most of these men will beback in this country by April.   Further reductions will bemade in the coming year.   We are also carrying out earlierplans to reduce the Brigade of Gurkhas to a total strengthof 10,000./Kong Kong o.. .
CONFIDENTIAL- 13 -Hong Kong28.    In 1958 the Hong Kong Government!s defence contribu-tion was fixed at  1.5m.      In 196k,  the Hong Kong government agreed to make an additional contribution of  6 m.  over six years for capital works.     We have also been receivingconsiderable payments due in respect of military and navallands returned to civil use.      From April 19^7,  these arrangements will be replaced by an agreement under whichthe Hong Kong Government will, for four years, make paymentstotalling  U.525Mo  annually towards the stationing costs ofBritish forces and the associated capital works expenditure.The Hong Kong Public Works Department will carry out worksmaintenance for the garrison.     Thus the total effective contribution of the Hong Kong Government towards the cost of britain&apos;s presence in Hong Kong will be  5M. a year.      some small reductions in our forces in Hong Kong are also beingmade.Middle East .....
JL-  1/4  -Middle East29.    In 1968 South Arabia will be independent.    Whenindependence comes, we shall withdraw all our forces.The Government is giving generous financial assistanceto strengthen the South Arabian federal forces in preparation for independence.    Consultations with theFederal Government and the necessary constitutionalsteps to bring South Arabia to independence are inhand.    We look forward to the United Nations playingan increased role during the present year in helping to resolve the outstanding problems.    In the meantime the three Services are carrying our their task, inparticularly difficult circumstances, in accordancewith their highest traditions and with conspicuousdevotion to duty.30.   Political arrangements have been made and practicalpreparations are under way for the small increase in-forces stationed in the Persian Gulf which we shall need to fulfil our remaining obligations in the area when weleave Aden.The Mediterranean31.    The first stage of the reductions in Cyprus - therundown at Nicosia airfield - has been completed in full consultation with the local civil authorities.    We have examined the forces and facilities required in the sovereign Base Areas.    About 2,000 soldiers and airmen willbe withdrawn by the end of this year.    We shall still be abto discharge the various military tasks which depend uponthe Cyprus bases,  including support for UNFICYP.
CONFIDENTIAL- 15 -32.   There is no longer a military need to retain anysubstantial forces in Malta.   Both the defence of thatcountry and our own strategical requirements can be assured by a combination of limited base facilities in Malta and ourrapid reinforcement capability in the United Kingdom.    Wehave recognised, however, that Malta&apos;s economy leansheavily on our Service establishments. For this reason, wehave sought throughout the consultations with theGovernment of Malta which began last August, to strike a balance between the rapid run-down of forces, which wouldhave brought maximum savings in defence budgetary and overseas expenditure, and the long-term maintenance of excessive forces in Malta, which v/ould have served theinterests of the Maltese economy.    In doing so, weextended the period of the run-down from two years to four.The conflict of interest however proved too sharp for the consultations to be brought tc a conclusion satisfactory to both parties.33.    In Libya, the RAF staging post at Idris has been closed down, and there may be some other small reductions in our forces stationed there.3I4..   Following the withdrawal of the Shackletons maritimereconnaissance squadron from Gibraltar last October, theAir Headquarters there was closed.   The Royal Air Forcecontinues to operate the airfield as a staging post and thecapability to reactivate it for maritime reconnaissance and other operations is being retained and exercised./35.   We..

The South. african government have been consulted and satisfactory arrange-ments have been made with them on the practical implications of these changes.The Services ..In^BrJj^aln39.    The pattern of deployment planned in the defence review will mean that a higher proportion of our forces will normally be stationed in the United Kingdom.    Itis. important that the relationship between the Servicesand the community should be easy and beneficial to both.,38.    It has always been one of the functions of the Arm-d.Services to aid the civil power when asked to do so.This kind of help takes many forms already.    The services have given invaluable help in national disasters like that at Aberfan; RN and RAH&quot; ships and aircraft frequentlyanswer calls of distress round our coasts.    service personnel and equipment are used for repairing roads,bridging and demolition; civilian&apos; patients are treated in Service hospitals; and Service communications are provided at big public occasions.33o   The Government is studying the scope for developing the peaceful use of military forces in thiscountry.PLANNING FOR TEE FUTURE  .,.
-17-PLANNING FOR THE FUTURECombat forces+0.     The Government is concerned to settle the size andshape of the forces for the next decade in a way that willprovide the maximum possible stability for the men andwomen who are making their career in the Services.      SinceBritain&apos;s contribution to NATO will have a criticalinfluence on the composition and deployment of all three services, final decisions on the shape and size of Britain&apos;defence forces in the 1970s must await the outcome of the nato discussions.     It is hoped to announce further planslater this year.1+1 *     Last year the Government took some major decisions on the equipment of our forces - with the result that plainshave been made to satisfy the main equipment needs of all three Services until at least the mid-1970s.     Chapters IVand VI deal with the present equipment and research anddevelopment programmes.1+2.      Extensive studies have been made of the possible ships and weapon systems which the Royal Navy will require asreplacements in the Fleet of the middle and late 1970s.A wide-ranging examination of the long-term structure ofthe Army is being carried out.     Good progress has beenmade with the RAF programme.     In particular, soundfoundations have now been laid for collaboration between britain and France in a variable geometry aircraft, aswell as in the Jaguar aircraft and the Martel air-to-ground missile;    and the two Governments have also agreed on the joint production ofa family of helicopters which willmeet requirements of the three Services throughout the1970s.A3.
1+3.     We have settled the broad shape of the future programmeof Service aircraft for the next ten years or so, andindustry should now be able to plan its future with confidence.     In the complex technical studies    of whichthis programme is&apos; the outcome   the interests of industry have constantly been borne in mind.     Where we have decidedto obtain aircraft from abroad, we have incorporatedBritish equipment into the aircraft, wherever possible.The offset arrangements,which we have negotiated withthe United States G-overnment, have opened up opportunities to British exporters.     The part played by the Ministry of aviation in this fruitful and developing partnership hasnow been taken over by the Ministry of Technology,,/Support Facilities
- 19 -CONFIDENTIALSupport FacilitiesIjii,     The planning of the future shape, size, and deploy-raent of our forces requires a continuous and thorough examination of the scale and organisation of supportfacilities, especially in the United Kingdom and Par East.We intend to cut supporting services, wherever possible, asreductions are made in the combat forces.     The inter-depen--dence of the Services at home will increase, as it has doneoverseas.     This will lead to the streamlining and re-location of facilities,  though sometimes at the expense ofconsiderable capital costs.h5.     The Statements on Defence 1965 and 1966 and Chapter iii of this Statement show some of the ways in which we havealready cut out duplication and overlapping between theServices.     The defence intelligence service has been completely integrated.     A single organisation now hand.esall Service lands questions.     We have placed many importantfunctions, e.g. supply of clothing, food end motor transport,under single-ilervioc management.      A rati onolised communica-tions network is being developed.     We have decided to set-up a Royal Defence Academy and a Royal Defence College toprovide higher education for all three Services.     With thenew organisation run by the Director General Supply andCo-ordination, we are standardising items, procedures andnomenclature in the logistics spheres We have investedheavily in computers.     We also devote considerableeffort to work study, 0 &amp; M and such techniques as criticalpath analysis, in addition to employing the services of management consultants.      By way of illustration, more than&apos;600 staff are engaged on standardisation work;    over 700people are employed full-time on work study;    and thecapital cost incurred on computers for administrativepurposes amount to about  7M. over the last 2 years or so.j^oiayaand. Structureh6.     We are undertaking a radical review of the home/eommnds.
commands. The aim is that each Service will have a mag or,. von t^line command, covering the whole, or the hulk,  of its  &apos;teeth&apos;units based in this country.     Other Service commands,which may he geographical or functional in character,will continue to exist.     Their precise nature will heworked out in relation to the special needs of each service, &quot;but the total number of commands will be reduced.Changes leading toward the new structure will begin inthe coming year.     They are designed to achieve greateroperational effectiveness, together with savings in manpower.Reorganisation of Ministershlo     The need to apply the necessary priority endmomentum to questions of support and organisation and tothe management and equipment field generally, was one important reason for the changes recently made in theroles of Ministers and for the creation of two new seniorposts for personnel and logistics and for projects.1+8. -   The growing interdependence of the three Serviceshas not only blurred the frontiers between the traditionalareas of separate Service management, but also imposed on the Ministry of Defence additional tasks of control andcoordination.     Moreover,  the Defence Review decisions have required the rapid preparation of,hplans for thelarge-scale redeployment of forces and the detailed planning and implementation of new equipment programmes.The work of direction and supervision has been heavy;    andit will continue to be so for some years to come.     Thehigher organisation has, therefore, been adapted to enablethe Secretary of State to concentrate on the wider aspectsof defence policy and planning, while retaining direct responsibility for operations and maintaining effectivepolitical supervision over the remainder of the defencefield.A9.
- 21  -U-9*     The Ministerial functions have, . therefore, &quot;been revised.       Instead of having only one Minister -the Secretary of State - primarily concerned with defence problems as a whole, while six Ministers concentratedmainly on the problems of the individual Services, theGovernment has changed the balance in order to have threesenior Ministers concerned with the problems of defence asa whole, with a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State incharge of each of the three Service Departments.50.      In October 19&amp;U, as an interim measure, each of theService Ministers of Defence was given a functional field of interest in addition to his Service reponsibilities.This arrangement has now been developed in a more effec-tive way.     The two new Ministers of Defence are free of single-Service reponsibilities, and each will havefunctional duties &apos; across the board&apos;;,    they will replace the previous - Service Ministers of Defence.  . One, whohas the title of Minister of Defence for Administration,is responsible for personnel and logistics matters affect-ting all three Services; the other, who has the title ofthe Minister of Defence for Equipment&apos;,  is responsible formatters concerning all three Services in research,development and production, and of procurement and sales.All six Ministers are members of the Defence Council,The Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State normallychair the Service Boards, in the absence of theSecretary of State./Chief Adviser
- 22Chief &quot;Adviser Personnel cxid Logistics5.1.Changes have also been made in some senior postsof the Ministry, chiefly in order to enable the Secretaryof State and the new functional Ministers to carry out their functions as effectively as possible,,     A seniorserving officer has been appointed Chief Adviser personnel and Logistics;    he assists the Minister of Defence for administration and acts through him as the principal adviser to the Secretary of State on personnel and logistics,subject to the overriding authority of the Chief of theDefence Staff, who remains the foremost adviser on all military matters.     The Chief Adviser Personnel andLogistics is the permanent chairman of the PrincipalPersonnel Officers&apos; Committee and the Principal Administra-tive Officers&apos; Committee;   he attends meetings of theChiefs of Staff when matters of concern to him are underdiscussion.     The post of Deputy Chief of Defence Staff(Personnel and Logistics) has been abolished..Defence Scientific Staff52.     The duties of the former Chief Scientific Adviserhave been re-allocated and reorganised.     In future, therewill be two posts of Chief Adviser - Chief Adviser(Projects) and Chief Adviser (Studies).     The ChiefAdvisers and their staffs, together with the ChiefScientists (Royal Navy), (Army), and (Royal Air Force)and their staffs, will continue to comprise the DefenceScientific Staff.
