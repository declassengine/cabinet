S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)FAMILY ENDOWMENT, CHILD POVERTY AND the plowden COUNCIL report memorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and ScienceAt their meeting on 20th December, (CC(66) 67th Conclusions,Minute 7), the Cabinet agreed, in their discussion of family endowmentand child poverty, that it would be desirable to take into account any recommendations which the Plowden Council might make bearing on thissubject.2,       The Council&apos;s Report has now been published.    It is a verythorough survey of the whole field of primary education and makes anumber of substantial recommendations v/hich I shall no doubt want tobring before my colleagues in due course.3.       But the recommendations to which the Report itself gives highest priority concern &quot;deprived&quot; children in under-privileged areas.    TheCouncil see the present situation as a vicious circle.    The school in the&quot;run down&quot; area finds it difficult to attract good teachers;  the premises are often dingy and inadequate; home environment is painfully limited;and the children&apos;s parents give them no encouragement.    Yet theCouncil are obviously right in believing that these children require morecare than others if their educational potential is to be realised.    they therefore recommend a policy of &quot;positive discrimination&quot; for what theycall these &quot;educational priority areas&quot;.4.     These recommendations have already attracted much public attention and sympathy and I am sure the Government cannot appear to turn a deaf ear to them - especially as the preceding Newsom Reportfrom the Central Advisory Council made a very similar case, about which little has been done, for the under-privileged children atsecondary schools,5.      The immediate relevance of the recommendations is to our discussion of family support, since there is obviously a high correlationbetween family poverty and social deprivation in the education sense.Indeed the Plowden Council see the handicaps as both financial and educational;  and their own suggestions for identifying &quot;educationalpriority areas&quot; include amongst the criteria a preponderance of large families and of families receiving benefits such as free school meals.C(67) 918th January, 1967COPY NO.CABINET
secret .      I therefore propose that, as part of our attack on child poverty,we should accept the Plowden judgment that schools of this kind needspecial helpD    One immediate possibility, to which the Plowden Councilattach special importance, is an increased allocation of minor works(those costing less than  20, 000 each) specifically directed to remedyingthe worst physical deficiencies! they propose an additional  2 million a year for five years.    Their other main financial recommendation isthat an additional distribution of Exchequer grant to local authoritiesshould be made in favour of the educational priority areas,    I recognisethat this is not possible before 1969 without major changes in the lav/and I therefore recommend that we should increase the building proposal made above to  4 million a year in England and Wales,    I can ensureadministratively that the investment is wholly applied to sociallydeprived schools or areas.    Though  4 million a year (starts)beginning in 1967-68 is a small sum in national terms, judiciouslyapplied it could have a marked effect, over the five-year periodproposed by Plowden, in rehabilitating poorly housed primary schools in these areas.    (Details of the expenditure involved are given in the annex.)   No doubt there is a corresponding case in some parts ofScotland,7. There are three other main Plowden recommendations for help tothese deprived areass-(i) The payment of differential salaries to attract more teachersto them.    This is a matter for the Eurnham Committee, andI shall want to discuss the Governments attitude separatelywith my colleagues.(ii) A change in the quota arrangements for the distribution of teachers.    I have just announced quotas for January 1968 whichwill assist this problem, but I shall want to revise them nextyear and I shall see that something more is done for thedeprived areas.(iii) An easement of the general prohibition on new nursery schools and classes to enable some to be established quickly in theareas of greatest need.    This is distinct from the generalPlowden recommendation that in the long run nursery education should be made available on a voluntary basisthroughout the country? action on this is a matter for the &quot;70s,not the 860s.    But the need for more nursery schools indeprived areas is a special problem.&quot;  An early start may welldepend on whether we can staff additional nursery schoolswith a much smaller proportion of qualified teachers than theexisting schools enjoy.    The National Union of Teachers have come out publicly against this, but I am studying it urgently.conclusion.      I invite my colleagues;-(i)  To note the position on differential salaries, the quota andnursery schools (paragraph 7).(ii) To endorse my proposal for an additional  4 million a year for five years for improvements to school buildings (paragraph 6).C, A.
