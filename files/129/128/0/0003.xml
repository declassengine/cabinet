VISITS BY THE PRIMEiMINISTER AND foreign secretary TO e.c. HEADS OF GOVERNMENTSTEERING BRIEFVisit of the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary to Rome,16th-17th January? 19 6?&quot;&quot;Scope of this briefThis brief is designed for the visit to Rome.     The course ofdiscussion in Rome, and also other developments, will certainlyrequire variations in the brief for Paris and the other capitals visitedthereafter.    But much of the present brief may well apply in all cases.Accordingly it is proposed to revise this brief in anticipation of eachseparate visit.Purpose of visit2.      In his statement in the House of Commons on 10th november the Prime Minister said that Her Majesty Js Government had conducted&quot;a deep and searching review of the whole problem of Britain&apos;s relationswith the e.c., including our membership of EFTA and of the Common-wealth&quot;,     The Prime Minister went on -&quot;Every aspect of the Treaty of Rome itself, of decisions taken subsequent to its signature, and of the implicationsand consequences which might be expected to flow fromBritish entry, have been examined in depth.&quot;In the light of this review the Government have decidedthat a new high level approach must now be made to see whether the conditions exist - or do not exist - forfruitful negotiations, and the basis on which such negotiations could take place. &quot;3.      The Prime Minister then referred to the EFTA Conference(which in the event was held on 5th December).    He added-&quot;Following that conference my right honourable Friend theForeign Secretary and I intend to engage in a series of discussions with each of the Keadc of Government of the six, for the purpose of establishing whether it appearslikely that essential British and Commonwealth interestscould be safeguarded if Britain were to accept the Treatyof Rome and join the e.c..    In the light of these discussions the Government will then take its decisionswhether or not to activate the arrangements for negotiating for entry, and what the appropriate time forsuch negotiations would be. &quot;4.     A further objective is to impress on the Six the importance ofa successful outcome of the Kennedy Round,    We told our EFTApartners that we would do this and we are publicly committed.-1-
5.      No communique should be issued after the Rome visit or afterthe subsequent visits.Order and Thming of Visits6.      The order and timing of the Prime Minister!s and ForeignSecretaryJs tour of the Six has been determined by three considera-tions:--(a) That it would be best to visit Paris neither first norlast (and Rome would be a friendly capital to visitfirst),(b) The availability of Ministers in the Six (there havebeen recent Government crises in Germany, theNetherlands and Luxembourg).(c) The desirability of completing the visits before thenext regular meeting of the EFTA ministerial council at Stockholm on 2nd-3rd March.7.      The complete programme for the discussions is;-Rome 16th-17th JanuaryParis 24th-25th JanuaryBrussels 31st January - 1st FebruaryLuxembourg 2nd FebruaryBonn 14th-16th february the Hague 26th-27th or 28th FebruaryEssence of the discussion8.      It will be essential for the Prime Minister to mention all the major problems to which we attach importance,, and, if there are other problems on which we shall have to right in any subsequent negotiations, either to mention thern or to use some general Languageclearly implying that such problems exist.     Otherwise, if such questions are raised in subsequent negotiations, we may be accusedwith very damaging effect of having misled the Governments of the Sixas to the nature and extent of our requirements,    Although the PrimeMinister will be seeking in the first place to state our problems and to learn what Community Governments may be prepared to do in the wayof dealing with them, he will also need to be ready to face the questionhow we ourselves would wish to treat them.    He may be told, perhaps in other capitals as v/ell as Paris, &quot;these are your problems.     It isup to you to suggest solutions to them.    We cannot say what we have in mind unless you tell us what you want. &quot;     Such questions cannotbe evaded.     The more precisely our difficulties can be stated, themore likely we are to learn what the Six would be prepared to do about them.    But we do not want to introduce rigidity into our own positionprematurely.    If they are pressed, the Prime Minister and foreign secretary can say - and carry conviction by saying - &quot;that there are some questions which cannot be answered at the present stage; thatin their nature these are questions on which the British government can only come to a firm view at the conclusion of the present round of-2-
high level probing; and that meanwhile, in order to assist them tocome to a firm view, we would be grateful for advice from ourCommunity colleagues,, &quot;    To take a line of this kind does not ofcourse prevent Ministers from exploring questions, going into thepros and cons, asking counter questions and so on,    But Ministersneed not be afraid of having to say baldly that they have not come toa firm or final position on this question or that.The particular problems which the Prime Minister will wish to raise9.      There will be advantage in the Prime Minister making clear atthe outset what is our position on the Treaty of Rome.    The SpeakingNote attached to this Brief covers the point,    In addition there arecertain questions which must be raised,,    These are agriculture(including of course Commonwealth agricultural trade), capital movements, regional policies and certain Commonwealth problems.Finally, the Prime Minister should say that he also foresees the needfor discussion of a number of subsidiary questions for which special arrangements may eventually be needed.    He should give illustrationsof these latter questions without indicating the nature of the solutionswe might want.10.     We may well need both derogations and transitional arrange -ments in order to solve the range of problems connected with our entry into the Community,    However, until we come to work out our negotiating position, it is not possible to indicate specifically whethera derogation or a transitional period or a combination of the twowould meet our requirement in a particular case.     There are someproblems affecting Commonwealth interests which, so far as we can judge at present, can only be solved by a derogation.    (in a recentmessage to the Prime Minister, Mr. Holyoake said that permanentrather than transitional arrangements were needed to safeguardNew Zealand&apos;s position, )11,     The Prime Minister will certainly be pressed, both in rome and in the other capitals, to accept transitional periods as the universal solution (except perhaps for the New Zealand case and thatof the less developed countries, to whom? special arrangements,e, g. association or trade agreements, might be offered).    Here thePrime Minister will remember that on some questions, e, g, agricul-ture, the longer the transitional period we can negotiate the better.Whereas on other question too long a transitional period wouldpostpone the advantages which we might otherwise hope to secure.A case in point is the dismantling of internal tariffs in the enlarged community, as contrasted with the adjustment of our tariffs, andparticularly our preferential tariff for the Commonwealth, to thecommon external tariff.    In the Heath negotiations a transitional period of 7 years looked like being secured for the Commonwealthadjustment.    In fact, different questions will call for differenttransitional periods or a combination of derogations (hard to obtain)and transitional periods (easier).-3-CONFtDSMTlAb
12.     It is suggested that the Prime Minister should take thefollowing lines-(a) Fie should avoid going into any detail.    He shouldparticularly avoid being drawn on any actualperiods of years as regards the length of transitionalperiods.    He need not be afraid of explaining thereason.     It is because this question is essentiallyone for negotiation.    It is a highly detailed andcomplicated one.    We might want different periodswithin the same subject (see above on internal and external tariffs).     And, in a case where we wanted a long transitional period, our opening bids would ofcourse require careful thought, as v/ell as the lengthof the period which we might in the end be ready tosettle for.(b) The Prime Minister should avoid giving any impression that transitional periods, as opposedto derogations, would be acceptable as the universal solution.    That point of view will be pressed on him.     If he is asked pointed questions,he can say that he cannot give a simple answerbecause of the interrelation between derogationsand transitional periods.    The greater the areaof derogation the less may be the need fortransitional provisions in any particular case.13.     The main lines to be followed in discussing the problems whichthe Prime Minister is recommended to raise are set out in thefollowing paragraphs.Points which the Prime Minister must raise and deal with14.     (a) Agriculture.     The Prime Minister should say that thereare four main aspects of the agricultural problem; the effect on our balance of payments (including the question of contributions to the guidance and Guarantee Fund);  the effect on the cost of living; theeffect on Commonwealth trade;  and the effect for pur own farmers.The Prime Minister might go on to illustrate under each of these fourheads, the difficulties (which were discussed at the Chequex-conference and the subsequent meetings of Cabinet) to which we think the application of the c. a. p. as it stands would give rise;   and toindicate the need, if these difficulties, are to be overcome, forarrangements of four kinds in modification of the c. a, p. ;-.(i)      a further review of the existing financial arrangements,so as to ensure equitable sharing of the burdens andthe advantages between all members of the community as it would then be;(ii)      further consideration of support and pricing policies,and arrangements for their regular review, in thelight of the circumstances of an enlarged Community;-4-
(iii) provisions to mitigate the major problems arisingfor certain Commonwealth countries., particularlyNew Zealand and some developing countries; and(iv) an adequate period of transition so that all interests affected - farmers, consumers, Exchequer,Commonwealth - would have time to make a complete and somewhat painful adjustment,03)   Capital movements.    The Prime Minister could point outthat the capital account is another vital element in our balance ofpayments.    There is at present a gap between our stringent controls on capital movements and the liberal regime which we should have toadopt   towards the Six if we became members of the e.c.*    one particular problem which must be discussed with the Six is how toguard against the danger  that portfolio investment to the Six couldbecome a channel for portfolio investment world-wide, thus imposing a significant additional burden on our external account.    we recognise that the gap between our present policies and those of the six will have to be closed and we shall need to discuss with them how this should be done acceptably to both sides and what transitional period would be reasonable.(c) Regional policies.    The State aids* involved in onxcurrent regional policy measures will, under Article 93 of the Treaty,become subject to examination by the Commission, v/ho have the powerto require us to withdraw those measures found to be incompatible with the e.c. regulations, subject to appeal to the Court of Justice orto a unanimous decision by the Council.     Our own regional measures are similar (but on a more extensive scale) to those of the Six,   all ofwhom are pursuing regional policies of varying character and intensitywith Community approval.     Some of our present instruments of regional policy, e. g. industrial development certificates and officepermits, may become less effective, if for example enterprises takeadvantage of the wider   choice of location inside the Community.     ThePrime Minister will wish to mention the particular difficulties whichmight arise for Northern Ireland.This subject will be of special interest to the Italians in viewof their own regional policies.    And the Treaty of Rome had a&quot;Protocol concerning Italy&quot; designed to enstoe that Italian develop-ment plans for the South of Italy and the islands could be carried out,with assistance from the Community.(d) Commonwealth questions, other than those dealt with underthe heading of agriculture at (a) above.    The Prime Minister shouldmake it plain that we have undertaken to consult with other commonwealth countries at all stages of any negotiations.    We shallwant to carry them with us if we can.    In so far as we ask formitigations, we shall be doing no more than the Six did at the timewhen they negotiated the Treaty of Rome.    They then arranged special provisions for overseas territories, e. g. Part IV of the Treaty, theMorocco Protocol and the Declaration of Intention in respect of theassociation of the Kingdom of Libya, etc.*   State aids also feature in existing United Kingdom arrangements for agriculture (see Annex A(A) l(i))and for management of the economy(see Annex A(C) 1).    All would be subject to Articles 92-94 of theTreaty of Rome.
(e)   Treaty of Rome.  This is a special point on which thePrime Minister is certain to be tackled in all capitals, Rome notthe least.    He should therefore raise it himself (see paragraph above).    While the French Ministers might raise the question in amore hostile fashion, our friends among the Five are likely to say&quot;When you are asked whether you accept the Treaty of Rome, whycannot you reply with a plain yes ?    K you could do that, you woulddisarm the French on an important point. &quot;   In reply to questions ofthis sort, the Prime Minister must rely on what he said in the Houseof Commons on 10th November in a supplementary reply toMr. Grimond; the text is in the speaking note attached to this brief.The Prime Minister could explain that the &quot;necessary adjustmentsconsequent upon the accession of a new member&quot; correspond to therequirements of Article 237 of the Treaty.     That is the Articleabout new members.    The more the Prime Minister qualifies his remarks about the Treaty of Rome, the less will be their effect.Points important enough to warrant mention but not importantenough to be gone into in depth15.     A list is attached at Annex Aa    It is suggested that the PrimeMinister should cover those points listed in the speaking note,making it clear that he cites them as instances, not as an exhaustivelist, that there are a good number of such points which must in thenature of things be dealt with but that to go into them all would be proper only to a later stage in the proceedings, vis., an actualnegotiation,EFTA and the Irish Republic16.     The Prime Minister will also wish to make it clear that heneither wishes nor is empowered to speak for EFTA countries.But it would be useful if, without appearing to seek information, hecould elicit the views of his interlocutor on Community membershipor association for other EFTA countries and the Irish Republic.Important points which may be raised by the other side17.     These are;  (a) Sterling, (b) Political union, (c) Defence.     Itis undesirable to raise any of these questions though we must beready to discuss them, on the lines of the discussion in the cabinet after the Chequers Conference, when they are raised by community countries.Problem of &apos;Manageability118.     The problem is that the number of fields in which new arrange-ments will have to be made, either before or after entry to theCommunity, is so large that we may expect enquiries and suggestionsfrom the Six as to how the range could be reduced to manageableproportions.     The question may arise in various forms, but in essence it is how fax we think we shall have to negotiate a cornprehen-sive set of terms before becoming members, and how far we can leaveissues to be decided after entry.     The problem of finding amanageable method of negotiation is likely to be raised with us atleast in The Hague and in Bonn.     We also have evidence that manyinfluential people in France, though not the Government, are interested in this problem.-6-CONHBENTlAb
19.     The best way for Ministers to deal non-committally withenquiries or suggestions from the Six on this question would be bymeans of counter questions and exploratory discussion.    ministers might take the line that one of the objects of the present probing isto ascertain the possibilities in this field and that whilst therefore we should welcome exploratory discussions we should clearly notbe in a position to take a view on such questions until after theprobings were completed.Kennedy Round20.     The Prime Minister should emphasise the importance of a successful conclusion.Difference s of emphasis in approaching the different Governments21.     It will be necessary in different capitals to lay differentemphasis on certain questions.    For instance, it will be necessaryto emphasise technology in Rome because of the Italian proposals on this subject.     Technology, defence and sterling may requirefuller treatment with the French than with the others.    But,however the emphasis is applied, it will be essential for what issaid to each Government to remain consistent with what is said tothe others.     The Six Governments have decided that they will poolinformation about each visit.     The (Belgian) Chairman of the councils to keep the Commission informed.    We can be sure that what issaid in each capital will percolate through to EFTA and commonwealth countries; and we are in any case ourselves committed to keepingEFTA and Commonwealth countries informed.&quot;Follow up&quot; to discussion22.     The question is whether there will need to be any &quot;follow up&quot;to the Prime minister&apos;s probing before Ministers reach their decision whether or not to seek negotiations! and, if so, at whatlevel (ministerial or official);  and what subjects might be sodiscussed.23,     It is recommended that the Prime Minister should not agreeto any request  or immediate &quot;follow up&quot; discussions, on the grounds that he could not carry talks with individual Governments furtherforward until all the Six capitals had been visited.    Aft er the plannedtour of visits it will be necessary for Ministers to consider the outcome, and the next steps.     The question of any possible &quot;follow up&quot; discussions will be for consideration then.
0)VISITS BY THE HI THE MINISTER AMD FOREIGN SECRETARYto^e.c. HEADS OF ^VERmS^TTSTEERING BRIEFMatters on which discussion will &quot;be neede^JUT^any negotiations but which need not &quot;be raised at this stage(A)   FOOD AID AG-RICULTJJRE1 .     The main &quot;second eleven&quot; points (likely to call for detailed discussionwith the Community in due course) in the food and agriculture field relate tothe &quot;Rules of Competition&quot; Chapter of the Treaty of Rome, viz;State Aids.     V/e should need to discuss reconciliation of some ofour agricultural direct grants with the provisions of Articles 92-94of the Treaty./JThe Six have not yet adopted rules for the implementation of these articles, which are intended to   &quot;outlaw&quot; any form of aid by nationalG-governments that distorts fair competition.     But it seems likely thatany aids related specifically to the production of a particularcommodity will be ruled out, while those that seek generally to improvefarm structure would be permitted.     This would put at risk many of our production grants - including particularly those to hill cattle and sheep farmers, who vail be among those most adversely affected by theCommunity&apos;s price policy.     At the least we shall need time for reviewing our present arrangements and adapting them to the changed circumstances .J7Approximation of Laws.     There may be problems over reconciling our existing national laws and regulations with Community directivesin the agricultural and food sector, under Articles 100-102 of theTreaty, on such matters as food standards, plant health, veterinaryregulations and farm safety./?he Community is making slow progress in its plans to harmonise economiclegislation over a wide range of Government activity which might affectthe terras of competition among member States.     The extent of anyproblems this might present for us will depend on the stage reached inthe Community at the material time and the form which Conmunity lawhas taken by then.     Again? at the least we shall need time for review and adaptation^(iii)   Marj^ejcing^JBoards.     The question would arise as to what would be thefuture of these statutory boards, concerned generally with theproduction and marketing of some major agricultural commodities,e.g. milk and dairy products, eggs, potatoes, having regard to theprovision of, in particular, Articles 85-90 of the Treaty.
/it is probable that as the Community&apos;s policy-implementing machinerydevelops there would be some role for these boards if we joined theCommon Market.     But it is not clear whether statutory powers of compulsion over producers which our Marketing Boards possess would be compatible with the rules of the Comuon Market^(B)    TRADE AlIRAN&amp;EMErTTS1 .     Entry into the Customs Union and adoption of the Common External TariffThere are a number of problems here which will require separatedisoussion, but they should not and need not be pursued during the probing.^-     Accession to the assooijrjajgn arrangements and Trade Agreements of theCommunity with other states the Community has association arrangements with the remaining dependenciesof the member countries ana, under the Yaounde Convention, with the formerAfrican dependencies now independent and special, arrangements with Algeria.It also has association agreements with G-reece and Turkey and Trade agreements with Israel and the Lebanon,,     The question whether the United Kingdom shouldaccede to these arrangements with or without modification, would need to bediscussed.     Membership of the Community would not automatically entailaccession to the arrangements made between Community Member Governments andthe Associates and other countries.     Policy questions might arise e.go whereexports from the countries in question compete with those of the CommonwealthoThe Yaounde Convention expires in May 19^9 and its renewal will have to be negotiated within the Community.     Since the French benefit most from thisConvention the need for it to be renewed might provide us with bargainingcounters.3.     FilmsWe should want to have the opportunity of discussing the rules for this industry with a view to harmonising support procedures,     ,/ftere we would hope to avoid having to conform entirely to the Community rules and to beable to negotiate amended rules more suitable for the enlarged Community^(C)   WMM&amp;!^f.3M ECCjjOMY1 .     In general, those adds to industry which tend to distort competition andintra-Community trade are liable to be disallowed by the Commission.     For-instance, of the long term measures, the premium element in the selective employment Tax and the proposed levels of investment grants would bevulnerable.     Some of the proposed IliC operations might e.lso cause difficulty.(2)CONFIDENTIAL
2.     Medium-term, policies (National Plan, &quot;Little Neddies&quot;, ProductivityPrices and Incomes Policy, etc.) and the concept of planning in general,are compatible with membership.     Our export promotional measures aregenerally acceptable, with the outstanding exception of the export rebate inrelation to exports to the Community, but aids for exports to third countries are subject to harmonisation.3.     In the short-term, we face closer co-ordination and surveillance of policies and less freedom to innovate economic management techniques;    this may be offset by provisions for mutual assistance.(D) FREE MpVMMT OF Y/CHKERS(i)   If the question of free movement of labour is raised, minister should say that, apart from the need for a transitional periodsuch as the member countries of the Community had themselves,there will be some problems to be resolved in connection withimmigration from the Commonwealth into the United Kingdom,(E) ECSC1.     We may have to look at the problems raised by the size of ournationalised undertakings in the coal and steel industries.     The point would arise particularly on steel if we acceded after vesting but before the re-organisation of the industry had been completed, when we should need tonegotiate the right to carry through the re-organisation as we saw fit.(3)CONFIDENTIAL
VTSTTS BY TFTP] PTiTME MINISTER AND FOREIGN SECRETARYTO e.c. HEADS OF GOVERNMENTSTEERING BRIEFVisit to Rome, l6th.-3.7th January .1967Speaking note the Foreign Secretary and I are very glad that you were able to makeit convenient for us to visit you first and at the outset of our round of visits to the capitals of Community countries. We have always known thatthe Italian Government is sympathetic towards our membership of theCommunity and we are very grateful for this opportunity of discussing ourproblems with you at this stage,2.     I should like to run over briefly the background to our present visit.Much of it will be familiar to you, but it may be helpful if I restate atthe outset what our position is and the reason for the visits which we aremaking to the capitals of the Six.3.     I told the House of Commons on the 10th November what it was that wehad it in mind to do, and a copy of my statement on that occasion was givento the Italian Government at the time.     I explained that over the previousweeks, and following the early process of exploratory talks carried out byMr. Brown in his capacity as First Secretary of State and by Mr. Thomson,the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Government had conducted a deepand searching review of the whole problem of Britain&apos;s relations with theCommunity, including our membership of EFTA and of the Commonwealth.   In thelight of this review, I said the Government had decided that a new high levelapproach must now be made to see whether conditions exist - or do not exist -for fruitful negotiations, and the basis on which such negotiations could take place,   I said that following the Conference of EFTA Heads of Governmentwhich I proposed to call -  and which took place in London on 5th December -I Intended to engage in a series of discussions with each of the Heads ofGovernment of the Six &quot;for the purpose of establishing whether it appearslikely that essential British and Commonwealth interests could be safeguardedif Britain were to accept the Treaty of Rome and join the European economic community&quot;.       I added that in the light of these discussions the Governmentwould then take its decision whether or not to activate the arrangements for negotiating for entry, and what the appropriate time for such negotiations would be.from the Italians/
1+.     The meetings which we are now entering upon are thus a logicalextension of the process which we began last summer of determining whetherconditions exist for fruitful negotiations and thus whether it is likely that, if we embark on a negotiation, it could be brought to a successful conclusion.   I am sure that neither you, nor we, nor any of our friends in the Six wants a repetition of the events of early 1963*   But I should like to stress again something that I said in the House of Commons on10th November: that &quot;we are approaching these discussions witr a clearintention and a determination to enter the Community if, as we hope, our essential British and Commonwealth interests can be safeguarded.   We meanbusiness.&quot;5.     And 1 should like to say how much we were encouraged by the reaction of the Italian G-overnment to my statement.   I thought Signor Fanfani put the situation very well when he said &quot;The decision clearly does not solve the problem but it sets in train procedures which can solve it&quot;.     And wewere very happy to see his next remark &quot;Italy will collaborate fully in thisso as to arrive at a positive conclusion,&quot;     This remark providedconfirmation, if any were needed, that we could look to the Italian G-overnmentfor a helpful and constructive approach to the problems that we shall be discussing today.6,   Following my statement in the House of Commons there have been twodevelopments In London.     The first was a two-day debate in the House ofCommons on the question of our relations with Europe.     I expect that reportsof this debate will be available to you.     It was principally remarkable Ithink for the wide agreement, from all political parties, that membership of the Community was a desirable objective.     And there can be no question that the G-overnment in its present approach to the Six enjoys a very wide measure of support, both Parliamentary and in the country at large.   A recentstudy by a confederation.tion of British    Industry-  Committee is firmly in favourof British entry into the Community.    The reports of public opinion pollson this subject have shown a heavy majority In favour of membership of theCommunity, provided of course that this could be brought about withoutimpairing the essential interests to which I have referred.7.     The second development was the meeting of EFTA Heads of G-overnment which took place at my Invitation at the beginning of December,   At that meetingall the EFTA countries welcomed the move as an important step along the road to determining the prospects for a solution to the question of economic integration in which they could all participate in an appropriate manner.   Andwe agreed again that we woull keep in the closest consultation with eachother on the development of our relations with the Community and of any discussions with the members of the Community,   We are of course notempowered to speak on behalf of our EFTA partners.-ii-
8.     Before going on to the questions which I should like to deal withduring the course of our talk today, I think I should make clear again ourposition toi^ards the Treaty of&quot; Rome.   I   think it is right for me to mention this first for it is the foundation stone.   It is sometimessuggested that Britain is not prepared to accept the Treaty, or that weshould wish to negotiate such revisions to it as fundamentally to alter its nature.   I do not think I can do better than to state again the words withwhich I described our attitude to the Treaty in Parliament in November.I then said that we take the view that the Treaty of Rome is not in itselfor necessarily an impediment; It need not be an obstacle if our problemscan be dealt with satisfactorily, whether through adaptations of thearrangements made under the Treaty or in any other acceptable manner.   Isummarised this important point by saying that we would be prepared to acceptthe Treaty of Rome subject to the necessary adjustments consequent uponthe accession of a new member, and provided that we receive satisfactionon the points of difficulties we see.9.     Now, in order to provide a factual basis for our talks, it may be helpful if I mention briefly at this opening stage what we believe to be the major points of difficulty, either for us or the Six.    Listed briefly theyare the problems arising from the common agricultural policy as it has emerged over the last few years;   Commonwealth questions;   problems related to freedom of capital movements; and problems of regional policy.   This isnot of course to say that there would not be other questions that would fall to be covered in any negotiation.    Such questions might include someagricultural questions not directly arising out of the common agricultural policy and the timetable by which we should expect to adopt the common external tariff and abolish internal tariffs within the expanded Community.I do not think we need to go in any detail into this sort of question today.They and others like them can be dealt with satisfactorily at a later stage.10.     I think therefore, if you agree, that the main questions to which weshould devote our attention are those arising directly out of the common agricultural policy, from the Community&apos;s provisions and directives onfreedom of capital movements, some principal Commonwealth issues includingNew Zealand, and the effects on our regional policy of being members of theCommunity.   I shall be prepared to expand on these questions during thecourse of our discussion;   and of course I shall be happy to learn what you think of the possibilities of overcoming the difficulties we see.   I shall also be interested to hear from you whether you think there are any major problems or difficulties other than those which I have mentioned, which you think we should discuss today.-iii-CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL11.     Perhaps before I finish this introduction, I should say a word aboutthe timing of this move, in relation to the Kennedy Round.   We might wish-to look at the Kennedy Round a little more closely during the course of theday.   But I wanted to say at the outset that our present initiative, and our interest in membership of the Community, does not imply in any way any reduction of interest in the Kennedy Round.   We have always believed, with you, in the vital importance of making a success of the present round of negotiations.   We all stand to gain from a successful outcome to them, andwe all stand to lose from failure.   The Kennedy Round presents the bestopportunity there has been to reduce trade barriers, not only within Europebut throughout the world.   We ourselves have never regarded the possibilityof our joining the Community in due course as making the Kennedy Round any the less important.12.   Mr. Prime Minister, I think we are engaged at the moment in a discussion,one of a series of discussions, which could be of the most far-reaching andhistorical importance for the future of Europe.   I do not think that we shallbe asking for anything which it is impossible to negotiate.   What we shallbe seeking to do is to safeguard our essential interests in the same way inwhich the Six countries themselves did, in the course of the negotiationsleading to the establishment of the Community.   But if it is possible to overcome the difficulties we foresee then I think a major new opportunity opensout for us all.   We shall have the potential afforded by a community of nearly 300 million people in Europe, with all that this means as regard economic development, and technological potential, and we shall thereby have taken a major step towards enabling Europe to play her full role in the world.-iv-
