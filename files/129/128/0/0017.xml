flS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)t5 Q5*5*C(67) 17COPY NO.17th February, 1967CABINETFAMILY endowment memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister without PortfolioFollowing the discussion at Cabinet on 20th December last(CC(66) 67th Conclusions, Minute 7) we have reviewed the whole problem,2.       We see very serious objections political and otherwise to a&quot;give and take&quot; scheme.    Part I of this paper shows why.    In ourview what is needed is a much more positive and precise approachdesigned to make best use of our limited resources and directed atproblems which ought to have first call on what we can afford.    Part IIexplains what we have in mind.    We might present this approach as&quot;Campaign against poverty - first steps&quot;.Part I - Objections to &quot;Give and Take&quot;Fiscal, Economic and Financial3.       Family allowances are State subsidies.    Tax child allowances are not;  they simply recognise that people with children cannot beexpected to pay as much tax as people with the same income without children.     The fundamental point is that to get more from tax reliefyou have to have more income, and it is positive earnings that we want to encourage.     To mix subsidies and tax allowances in a mechanisticscheme is to mix chalk and cheese.4.       People much prefer to retain money they have earned by theirown hard work than to receive the same amount from the State.&quot;Give and take&quot; runs flat contrary to this preference and would do so inthe case of 3^ million taxpayers who receive family allowances, only about half of whom would have some net gain,5.      A constant criticism of PAYE is that a man is not allowed tokeep more of what he earns - especially on overtime.     Yet when thenational need is to encourage people to work, &quot;give and take&quot; would bring some 600,000 extra people into tax;  it would also increase the tax of families with two or more children - in the case of 10s, Od,&quot;give and take&quot; by 15s. Od. per week for a man with three childrenearning  20 per week.     True there would be greater or less financial
compensation from increased State subsidies paid to the wife but thiswould not be an effective substitute.6.       &quot;Give and take&quot; would be looked at with grave suspicion andresentment by all taxpayers.    Given Fress comment and what hasbeen publicly advocated by some groups &quot;give and take&quot; would bethought to be merely the first step in &quot;confiscating&quot; tax child allowances and thereafter other personal allowances.7.      It is technically true that &quot;give and take&quot; would only marginallyimpose the cost of helping poorer families on other families.    but could we possibly convince the public of this since in fact we wouldbe paying out  160 million or so in cash and financing this as to about80 per cent by increased tax on families with two or more children?8.       &quot;Give and take&quot; would create all sorts of anomalies in the tax system.    Some examples are given in Annex A.9.       Tax allowances would be made intolerably complicated andillogical at the very time when we are trying to simplify the tax system.It would not be possible to maintain such a structure for very long;  allkinds of claims for further concessions would be made.     The poorestparents would want family allowances for the first child in the familyand would say that this concession could be financed easily by a reductionof child allowances.     The greatest danger would be pressure, which inthe long run would be very difficult to resist, for tax child allowances for second and subsequent children to be restored to their original figure.We should then be left meeting the full cost of the increased family allowances, without any compensatory adjustment (10s. Od. on family allowances is equivalent to an extra 6d. on income tax).10.       We should be criticised once more for shuffling round large sums of money and disturbing the; financial arrangements of nearly 4millionfamilies in order to distribute a small fraction of these sums.11.       The mechanical interlocking of cash benefits and tax allowancescould in future seriously limit the room for manoeuvre in adjustingtaxation to economic needs and in financing public expenditure.Incomes Policy12.       It may be thought that &quot;give and take&quot; would help with our incomepolicy, by making family men with the lowest incomes better off and soreducing the pressure for wage increases.     The other possibility - whichwe think more likely - is that salary and wage earners v/ho were affectedby the cut in tax allowances would look at their reduced &quot;take home&quot; pay and would press for bigger pay to make it up.    In any case &quot;give and take&quot; would have no effect except on earners with two or more childrenwithin the family allowance field.    Increased family allowances would do nothing to reduce wage claims by single and married people without children, and those with only one child,     &quot;Give and take&quot; v/ouldsubstantially reduce the levels of earnings at which the people affectedwould begin to pay tax, or to pay at the standard rate.    A 10s. 0d,increase in family allowances accompanied by a cut of  45 in child allowances v/ould mean that those income levels would be reducedby  84 a year per &quot;qualifying&quot; child.    This would considerably increasethe grumbles about tax disincentives to working harder, doing overtime,etc.
Public Expenditure13.       Two points here:-(l) Too much should not be made of this, but &quot;give and take&quot; wouldmean another  160 million or so on Votes which it would not be easy toexplain away particularly overseas,(Z)    &quot;Give and take&quot; is very expensive.    Even the &quot;net&quot; cost, i. e.difference between increased payments and increased taxation, is forthe 10s. Od. scheme.      48 million in the first year and  32 millionthereafter.    In terms of loss of taxable capacity the cost is likely tobe a great deal higher, and it is this higher cost that will limitcorrespondingly what we can do in furthering our economic and social policies elsewhere.    My colleagues know how difficult theoutlook is.Other Shortcomings14.       &quot;Give and take&quot; is so designed that it would give some net help,often marginal, indiscriminately to large numbers of families.    even with a net cost of  48 million in the first year and  32 million thereafter:-(1)     It would only bring 57 per cent of the 160, 000 families known to bebelow supplementary benefits level up to that level.    It is these familieswho are the subject of the Government Survey due to be published in the spring.(2)    It would damnify 2 million families.    True by small sums butpolitically this would be very troublesome.    Of course we could avoid this if we added further to the cost of &quot;give and take&quot; but we could solvelots of problems if we had unlimited resources.15,       &quot;Give and take&quot; in spite of its cost would not deal effectively withany of the problems we do know exist e, g, families with really lowincomes, those physically or mentally unable to better themselves and so on.    Nor does it recognise that poverty may arise from special problems such as low wage areas or regional differences.    And it doesnothing about one-child families or the first child in larger families.16.       Finally at a time when we are dissatisfied with the family allowance system, &quot;give and take&quot; would embed it more firmly than ever into the Social Security structure.Other Possible Schemes17.       We have considered very carefully whether there are other less objectionable schemes.    We have looked at &quot;option schemes&quot;i. e. under which people can have family allowances or tax child allowances but not both, and at &quot;give and take&quot; in reverse i. e. underwhich tax allowances would remain as they are or be improved butfamily allowances tapered off.    We are clear that none of these are practicable because of cost, complexity, inequity as between individuals,the administrative burden, or some combination of these factors,
Part II - A Direct Aid Approach18. In our view a more positive approach is needed which will showclearl6 mat we are doing out best to deal directly with the v/ell knownpressing problem of 160, 000 families with inadequate incomes and thatwe are showing a real concern for those in trouble; and which give thefullest possible value for money.19.       We might approach this on abroad front and put forward a packageof specific measures.    It would of course be necessary for us to discussits precise make up and details with our colleagues but some of the elements could be:-(i) A scheme of supplementary family allowances. This would beincome-tested but adapted to help those who have to pay high rents anddistressed families with only one child whom &quot;give and take&quot; would not help at all,(ii) An increase of say 5s. Od, in family allowances for fourth and subsequent children.(iii) Help for educationally &quot;deprived areas&quot; - the Secretary of Statefor Education^ paper C(67) 9 refers.  Help of this kind would clearly bedirected at a real heed and children would be certain to get the benefit.(iv) Proposals have already been made and considered in the social services Committee on &quot;Service by Youth&quot; - these could be associated(SS(67) 1st Meeting).1:1 :(v)  Some special recognition of the position of fatherless families.This could be given in connection with (i) and (ii) above.    (special attention was drawn to this problem in the recent Report of the inner london Education Authority).(vi)  Progress on local authority rent rebate schemes.20.      (i) above could take various forms but we might give 5-iOs, Od.supplementary family allowance for the first, second and thirdchildren in families so designed that it gave help tapered off to athree-child family with an income of up to about  17 a week,, inaddition to family allowances and national insurance contributions^^jj3* could deduct rent in assessing income - the wide variation mrents is one of the most serious factors in poverty and deprivation,(For example if the income limit for full supplementary allowanceswas  10 per week a man earning  14 per week would still get fullbenefit if he had to pay  4 per week rent).     This could be of specialvalue to people who perforce have to live in privately ownedaccommodation who cannot benefit under rent rebate schemes.The supplementary allowance would be paid to the wife, therewould therefore be no obvious supplementation of wages and noinvidious shop floor comparisons.    A 10s, Od. supplement for first, second and third children v/ould cost  11-12 million per annum and together with (ii) above would deal fully with at least 65 per cent of families below supplementary benefit level - a higher proportionat much lower cost than &quot;give and take&quot;.
21.       We know some of our colleagues are not happy about furtherincome-testing.    V/e sympathise with this view but there is a balanceto be struck here.    We cannot afford to waste resources and taxable capacity and there is really very little criticism indeed of the manyincome tests which already exist (Annex B).     Moreover an incometest does ensure that our limited resources go where they do mostgood;  and it ensures that the real cases of hardship do come to notice and that the public services can be mobilised to help them.22.      (ii) above would cost about  12 million per annum if we gave theincrease to the fourth and all subsequent children.    But here againvariations are possible.    An increase of 5s. Od, could be given forthe fourth child only - cost  7. 5 million.    A 7s. 6d. increase for thefourth child only would cost some  11 million.23.      We understand that 50 per cent of the families with inadequateincomes live in local authority housing.    Effective rent rebate schemes should help greatly and directly.    Special guidance to local authorities could be tied in with a &quot;direct aid approach&quot;,24.      We emphasise that we would need to discuss with our colleaguesconcerned before deciding the precise nature of the measures to be taken and what forms or combination of e. g, the ideas set cut above would givebest value.    It may be we should have to analyse or analyse further what sort of families most need help.Conclusion25.      We invite the Cabinet to endorse &quot;a direct aid approach&quot; and toauthorise us to v/ork cut the details with our colleagues concerned,ij. J. C.P. G. W.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.17th February, 1967
ANNEX a tax ANOMALIESAssuming &quot;10s. Od. give and take&quot;:-(a) A first child under 11 would attract an allowance of  115, availableagainst income tax and surtax.    Second and subsequent children under 11v/ould attract an allowance of  70, and the compensation in the form of higher family allowances would not fully compensate the standardratepayer - still less the surtaxpayer.     Suggestions that the oldallowance of  115 should run for surtax but only  70 for income tax would introduce further confusion and would still not leave the surtaxpayerno worse off (since he pays more than the standard rate of income tax on family allowances).(b) The child allowances for the first child in the family, childrenover 19, children (e. g. of Commonwealth immigrants) outside theUnited Kingdom and some other categories would be given in full attheir present amounts, but the allowances for all other children wouldbe reduced by  45 with an associated increase of 10s. Od. in family allowances.    This would greatly complicate the child allowance system,(c) The basic child allowance for a second child would be reduced to 70;  but a dependent relative attracts a basic allowance of  75 and therelative may have income drawn in whole or in part from public funds upto a total of  210 without any reduction of the dependent relativeallowance,    (Most children have little or no income of their own -but most dependent relatives have  4 a week national insurance retirement pension).    For many years the income limit for adependent relative up to which the full dependent relative allowance is given has been increased to keep in line with periodical increases in national insurance retirement pensions.    Parents would want toknow why an increase in family allowances was talc en as an excuse for cutting down child allowances - particularly when the increases in family allowances increased their own taxable income,    (Eventhose who understood the position at the start would soon forget thatthey had, in effect, exchanged part of their child allowances for biggerfamily allowances and v/ould claim that the reduced allowances were too low).    It would also be asked why a child with a personal income of upto  115 attracts full child allowances, whereas smaller sums paid by theState lead to a reduction in the child allowance.(d) The result in some cases would be contrary to the intention of helping the poorer families e, g, there would be no tax set-off in caseswhere the child does not rank for child allowance (if it has an income ofits own above the qualifying child1 s income limit).
