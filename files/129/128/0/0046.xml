tDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0 \C(67) 467th April, 1967COPY NO,CABINETTHE FUTURE OF PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY;STATUTORY powers memorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic AffairsThe Cabinet invited me on 4th April (CC(67) 17th Conclusions,Minute 2) to circulate a memorandum assessing the implications forproposals for statutory powers as a whole of a decision to omit thepower to prevent retrospective payment of a wage increase following the imposition of a standstill.2.       The object of taking powers beyond the present Part II of thePrices and Incomes Act is to secure moderation in prices and incomesincreases.    Since none of us believes that this can be achieved whollyor even mainly by statutory powers, we must plan on the assumptionthat there will be a considerable measure of voluntary support formoderation.    But our immediate aim must be to damp down the reactionsby management and unions to the lifting of standstill and severe restraint so that the transition is not too abrupt.    Otherwise we couldquickly lose much of the benefit which we have secured over the pastnine months.3.       The Cabinet agreed that we should seek further temporarylegislative powers for this purpose,    I madcclear my own view that ifit was to be sufficiently effective such legislation ought to include thepower to prohibit the implementation of pay increases with retrospectiveeffect.    But a decision by the Cabinet against the inclusion of provisions for this purpose would not, in my view, reduce the need for legislation.The maximum delay of one plus three months under Part II as it standsis too short.    Settlements are already being made for implementationafter 30th June and the Government will wish to refer some of them tothe National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI).    With the presentmaximum standstill of four months the parties would in such cases be free to implement the settlements during the second half of 1967,    Itis right, therefore, to extend the maximum period of delay to one plussix months in cases where the NBPI recommends use of the power torequire a further standstill of three months after publication of itsreport.-1-
4.       But the dropping of power to bar retrospection makes itnecessary to think again about our proposal to take power to requireprice reductions (as opposed to delaying price increases).    It would be bound to strike management as a serious disturbance of a reasonable balance between the treatment of prices and pay, the more so becauseretrospective increase of prices is in most cases quite impracticable.There could be few cases in which the supplier could recoup himselffor the lower price which the standstill had compelled him to hold forseveral months.    Moreover, if subsequently a supplier tried to increase prices by a larger amount than he had previously notified, it would beopen to the Government to refer him again to the NBPI with a consequential further standstill.5.       Much as there is to be said for taking power to require price reductions, I accordingly think that it would be impossible to justifythis to management if we drop the power to bar retrospection.    If,therefore, the Cabinet still consider this essential, then I think that weshould seek the following temporary statutory powers(i) Power to enable the Government, at their own discretion, to implement recommendations by the NBPI that a price or pay increase should be deferred (or implemented in part or ininstalments) for a further period after the Board has reportedsubject to a maximum of six months from the date of referenceto the Board.(ii)  Power to secure a temporary reversion of a price or pay increase which has already occurred but which meritsexamination by the NBPI.(iii) Removal of the cause of actions for breach of contract relatingto the period of standstill and severe restraint (amendment ofSection 30 of the Prices and Incomes Act).M. S.Department of Economic Affairs, G.W.1.7th April, 1967
