3.      It is sometimes suggested that a reduction in personal tax allowances as well as in child allowances would be appropriate, so that people with        or no children, as well as those with two or more,would contribute to the cost of the scheme.    While it is not for me tosay how the net cost should be met, I think this suggestion may be basedon a misunderstanding of the nature of the scheme proposed.    as explained above, the reduction in the tax child allowances should beseen as a convenient way of concentrating the additional help on lowerincome families, and not as making families with children pay for thescheme.The family circumstances survey4.      The essential results of my Ministry&apos;s recent survey of familycircumstances are summarised at Annex A.    Including some allowance for one-child families (not covered by the survey) they indicate that about 160, 000 families, containing about 5 00, 000 children, have incomeswhich are below the present supplementary benefit level and cannot bebrought up to that level because the father is in full-time work or subjectto the wage stop.    These &quot;deficient&quot; families are generally instances ofan able-bodied man, most often a manual worker, in a low-paid job;only about one in six of the fathers in &quot;deficient&quot; families was handi-capped by ill-health.    The survey&apos;s findings show further that there are about 300, 000 families with two or more children, containing about900, 000 children, where the father is in full-time work and the incomeexceeds the supplementary benefit level by less than  3 a week.    Some65,000 families above the supplementary benefit level would be&quot;deficient&quot; but for the wife&apos;s earnings.    (Apart from the wage-stoppedcases, the above figures do not include families receiving or eligiblefor supplementary benefit or national insurance benefit)5.      The full report on the survey will not be ready for publicationuntil late May or June, but it will not add significantly to the materialalready available in helping to compare the effects of alternative schemes.We are already in a position to assess the extent to which a givenincrease in family allowances would reduce the numbers of &quot;deficient&quot;families and help other low income families.Illustrative give and take schemes6.     The tables in Annex B set out the essential features of threeillustrative give and take schemes, involving increases of 7s, , 10s. ,and 15s. a week in the present family allowances.    The correspondingtax allowance reductions have been calculated to the nearest  5,    Withthe 7s. scheme this results in the ordinary standard rate taxpayerjust breaking even.    With the 10s. scheme he loses 4d, a week, andwith the 15s. scheme 1^-d a week, per FAM child.    These small lossescould, if necessary, be avoided by a slightly higher family allowanceincrease or a slightly lower tax allowance reduction, with acorresponding increase in cost (e. g, about  6 million a year in thecase of the 10s. acheme).-2-
CONFIDE,! i  i47Reduction in the husband1^ take -homejpay7.      It may be suggested that, even though a family1 s total net income may be improved or remain unchanged, difficulties may arise from what is in effect the transfer of part of that income from the husband^ pay-packet to the wife&apos;s family allowances,,    We should however not under-estimate the extent to which, nowadays, it isnormal for married couples to work out their financial arrangementsjointly.    And where the husband is selfish or unreliable, it is likelyto be all to the good that the wife should have higher family allowances to draw on and so be less dependent on what he chooses to give her.8.      Given proper public understanding of the scheme, which shouldbe possible with suitable publicity and the help of the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) and Confederation of British Industry (CBI) I do notthink there need be serious problems in this direction.    Certainly itshould not be difficult to rebut any claims that the reduction in thehusbandrs take-home pay justifies a wage demand;  indeed, by providing an acceptable form of extra income over a considerable area of lowerpaid workers with families, the scheme might well help materially inlimiting pay increases.conclusion.     I ask my colleagues to agree now that we should have a give and take scheme to operate from April, 1968,    I should then wish to discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister without Portfolioboth the precise level of the scheme and the programme leading up toits introduction, including consultation with the TUC and CBI and apublic announcement at the appropriate time.M.

CONFIDENTIAL 4ANNEX ATHE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL SECURITY SURVEY1.     About 2,700 families in Great Britain with two or more childrenfalling within the family allowances definition were approached in thelatter half of June and beginning of July 1966, and nine out of ten ofthem were interviewed and answered a comprehensive set of questions about their incomes, housing, health and other matters.   The total incomes ofthe fathers and mothers, after deduction of income tax, National Insuranceeontributions and working expenses and the addition of family allowances,were compared with the amounts provided for families of the same size andtype by way of national assistance soale rates and housing costs (referredto as the &quot;assistance standard&quot;).   Later on, the same comparisons weremade using supplementary benefit rates instead of national assistancescales (supplementary benefit standard or level).2.     Except where otherwise indicated, the figures given in this noterelate to families with two or more children and represent the numbers which would have been found to have income deficiencies if the supplementary benefit rates had been in operation last summer, and thenumbers of children ixx those families.3.     The material collected was examined to obtain estimates of the numbers in the four groups indicated below -(1)   How many normal families* were there in the country whioh wereliving below the supplementary benefit level whose fathers couldnot have their incomes brought up to that level because they werein full-time employment or receiving non-contributory benefit which was wage stopped?(2)   How many other normal families were there which were living below that level for short or long periods, or actually reoeivingassistance?(3)   How many fatherless families were in this position?(if)   How many families appeared to have income deficiencies because ofspecial circumstances, e.g., because the father was away from home?4.     The first of these subjects of investigation is the one which is mostrelevant to this Paper.   The survey, together with information from other sources about the numbers of families actually wage-stopped and a &quot;bestguess&quot; of the number of one-child families below the supplementary benefitNormal families were defined as those comprising in the household aman, a woman and children.(1)
CONFIDENTIAL ^level, indicates that about 160,000 families, containing some 500?000children are living below the supplementary benefit level and are unableto get their income brought up to that level(a).   About 70 per cent of the families have three children or less, but rather less than half thechildren are in such families.   More detailed findings for normal families with fathers working full time are given in paras. 5-10, and a briefindication of oLher findings in paras. 11-14.N^rmal^fjamilles - fathers working full jtime5.     The survey results suggested that there were last summer some 70,000families with two or more children in which the fathers were working fulltime but the family income - including the earnings of a wife, if working -was deficient compared with the national assistance standards then current.Because a number of families, particularly those with two children, hadincomes only a little higher than that level, the number with deficiencieson the supplementary benefit standard appeared to be nearly twice as many -about 130,000 - and for a further 65,000 any interruption in a wife&apos;3 powerto earn would have brought the family below the supplementary benefit level.(There were nearly a million families in which wives were working.)   Sinceneeds were calculated on the basis of present housing costs rather than onthe cost of adequate housing, these figures represent an assessment of the family&apos;s financial capacity to live with reasonable provision within its existing accommodation.   There was evidence that large families tended topay, on average, less rent xhan smaller ones, which suggests that somefamilies make ends meet by accepting poor or overcrowded conditions.6.     Apart from the 130,000 families with income deficiencies, there were a further 300,000 with less than  3 over and above the supplementary benefitstandard, divided as follows -Less than 20s. above standard 75,00020s. but less than 40s. above standard 90,00040s. but less than 60s. above standard.,, 135,0007.     Nearly a quarter of the families with income deficiencies on the supplementary benefit standard had net joint incomes of husband and wifeamounting to  15 a week or more; over a quarter had between  12   10s. and 15 a week, and about half had less than  12   10s.   For some 90,000 ofthese families with deficiencies the net earnings of the father were lessthan  12   10s.8.     About one in six of the fathers of families with income deficiencieswas handicapped by ill health.   About one in eight was self-employed andthree-quarters were manual employees.(a)   These figures, but not others given in this note, have been adjusteddownwards (by 10 per cent) to offset the understatement of incomecommonly found in enquiries of this type.
9.     The proportion of families with deficiencies rose with the size of family.   Families with two or three children accounted for about two-thirds of those with income deficiencies but for less than half of the children insuch families.   The proportions were as follows -Families with -2 children3m5Proportion of families ofthat sizewhich hadincomedeficienciesa)33Proportion ofdeficiencyfamilieswhich were ofthat size10224917138126 or more children(a)    On the supplementary benefit standardPer centProportion ofchildren indeficiencyfamilieswho were infamilies ofthat size301616122510.   The average size of the deficiency below the supplementary benefitlevel was about 25s. a week.   Probably about 55*000 families containing195*000 children had a deficiency of 20s. a week or more, of which some30,000 containing 110,000 children had a deficiency of 40s. or more.   Theeffect of a given deficiency on a family&apos;s standard of living will of coursevary with the size of the family.   Conversely, the effort required, other things being equal, to achieve a given standard of provision will increase with the size of the family.Famid-ies which could receive supplementary benefit11.   The circumstances of those families which already receive supplementary benefit at the full rate, or which could do so if they applied for it, are relevant to the consideration of the proper level of supplementary benefitrather than the wider issue of the proper level of family endowment, soonly a brief indication of findings in this field follows.12.   The survey indicated that about a quarter of the families in whichthe fathers were sick or unemployed or working short hours were receivingassistance last summer, and about as many again appeared to be entitled toapply for it.   The proportion which would now be entitled to receivesupplementary benefit would probably be different because of the introductionsince then of earnings-related benefits.13.   It appeared that at the time of the survey at least nine out of ten ofthe fatherless families which would otherwise have had income deficiencieswere receiving national assistance.   For the remainder, the amount of the(3)
deficiency was snail or the circumstances such as to cast some doubt on the validity of the findings.   The great majority of the families which needed,and received, assistance were families in which the mother was divorced, orseparated from her husband, or unmarried (in some cases looking afterorphaned children).M+. No other group of families was identified as presenting a problem whichwas not provided for under the existing arrangements.Estimates based on survey results15.    The data from the Ministry&apos;s survey have been used in ANNEX B to assess the effectiveness of different schemes in meeting the income deficiencies ofthe 160,000 families.   This material is the best available and the full report, when ready, will add little which is relevant for this purpose.However, the estimates must nevetheless be regarded as liable to a margin of error:    this is because (a) the sample was small and, therefore, somo of thefigures - for example, those for families with two children - are subject to considerable sampling error, (b) it was not practicable to verify the state-nents of earnings, and (c) the survey could not be designed, in advance, to suit all the schemes now under consideration.   For these reasons the figuresbased on the survey should be taken as giving broad indications and notprecise evaluations of the effectiveness of the schemes.Current and future trends16.   The families of men with deficient   incomes who were in employment atthe time of the survey but are now unemployed and wage-stopped were, and remain, within the estimate of 160,000 families with income deficiencies.The wages freeze -will have prevented any reduction in this number since last summer, but the thaw for low-paid workers may effect some reduction inthe coming months.   Any increases in housing costs will have the oppositeeffect except to the extent that local authorities extend their arrangementsfor rent rebates.17.   At any point of time the number of families with income deficienciesdepends on the general level of earnings among low-paid workers as comparedwith the level of supplementary benefit, including rent.   As earnings rise,the number of deficient families tends to fall until the scale rates arenext increased, when they rise sharply and then begin to fall off again.(4)
