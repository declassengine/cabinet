They felt, however, that in view of theirnovelty, it v/ould be right to arrange for the widest possible consultationwith the interests concerned, and for an informed public discussion ofthem, before the Cabinet were invited to reach a decision;  and arrange-ments have been made accordingly.3.       When the memorandum is published it will be made clear thatno decision has been, or will be, taken by the Government on theproposals until there has been full consultation and public discussionof them, so that the Government^ eventual decision on it may be takenin the light of the fullest possible information.    But it will also be made clear that the presentation of this proposal is an initiative to which theGovernment attach considerable importance in the light of the high priority which must be given to a reduction of the disparity in unemploy-ment levels between the development areas and the rest of Britain and tothe achievement of the maximum rate of economic growth consistent withthe maintenance of the stability and balance of the economy at home andabroad.secret

THE,,. DEVELOPMENT.....ARMSA PROPOSAL FOR A. REGIONAL ^EMPLOyjJENT PREMIUMStudies carried out by trie Departments concerned with, theproblems of the Development Areas in Great Britain, and withthe system of selective employment payments, in accordancewith statements made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have led. to a proposal that a regional employment premium for manufacturing industry in the Development Areas should beintroduced into this system.     The economic case for thisproposal, and nther considerations which have to be taken intoaccount, have been set out in a memorandum which the Governmenthave sent to the National Economic Development Council and tothe Economic Planning Councils in Scotland, Wales and theEnglish regions for their comments.     The text of thismemorandum is now published as a basis for public discussion and further consultation.     The memorandum does not deal withcertain other aspects of the selective employment tax whichhave been under review and on which the Government&apos;s decisions will be announced separately.5th April 1967.SECRET, UNTIL 00,,3.0 HOURS ON 5TH APRIL, 1967.

A^^A^^h^P^QblgJL-0A Ake- Dev el pj)ment areas,   In the space of two generations there have been massivechanges in the way that people in Britain earn their living,A great shift has taken place from working on the land and fromthe older industries, while whole new industries - the motor industry, aircraft, plastics,  electronics, oil refineries andso on - have grown up.     There has also been a long-term growth in the numbers engaged&apos;in most service occupations.2.     Before the first World War there were nearly one and a half million people in agriculture (and still about a million in1939) but to-day there are 750,000, including those self-employedin agriculture.     There were well over a million men in coal-mining;    to-day there are only half as many,3.     The impact of these changes has varied between regions, andthe factors determining the structure of industry in any regionare complex.     But a general feature of the Development Areas,as they are now called, is that they have been particularlydependent on some of the industries with contracting employment,and their share in the new and fast-growing industries has sofar been barely enough to compensate for this contraction.     Asa result, unemployment within the Development Areas has been substantially worse than the national average for a long period.There is a roughly similar situation, and a still higher levelof unemployment, in Northern Ireland.4.     Coal-mining is an outstanding case where the brunt of thedecline has been borne by the Development Areas,     Shipbuilding,&quot;the railways and the manufacture of rolling stock are among theother industries now employing far fewer men than in the pastin some of the Development Areas-     This situation reflects notonly changes in demand but also great advances in productivity,as a result of which fewer men are needed to meet a given demand.1 .SECRET UNTIL 00-30 HOURS ON 5TH APRIL, 1967.

Inspite of this, these three industries still account for over11$ of employment in all the Development Areas, as compared with.4$ for the whole of Great Britain.     The Development Areastherefore remain particularly vulnerable to any furthershrinkage in the numbers needed by this group of industries.7.     Unemployment in these regions would have been more sub-stantia.1 than it has but for the outward migration which hastaken place.     Over the period 1955 to 1964j  outward migrationof employees from Scotland, Wales and the Northern Region,taken together, exceeded inward migration by 200,000.     Theirpopulation nevertheless rose, because of natural increase 1    andemployment also grew, but only by 3$ as compared with thenational average of 8$,     An appreciable improvement would be needed in the number of new jobs created in order to make full use of the available labour resources of these regionstogether with a reduction in net migration.

Limited remedies were first attempted between the twoworld wars.      Prom 1945 onwards successive Governments have setthemselves systematically to promote employment in new orexpanding enterprises in the problem areas.     The boundaries ofthe areas selected for attention have varied over the years, anda wide range of measures has been used including, for instance,special help for industrial training and for public servicesneeded by industry,,      But there have been three main instruments,Eirst there have been programmes of assistance for private capital investment in the areas of high unemployment.     Second,there has been direct investment in factory building by theGovernment itself.     Finally, there has been the control of new projects by the system of industrial development certificates,now reinforced by building controls and by the requirement of office development permits in the Midlands and the South East;an object of these controls is to help in steering projects tothe Development Areas.10. The present Development Areas, and the present system of investment incentives, were established under the Industrial

Reflecting the present Government1 sbroad, regional approach to the problem, the Development Areasnow comprise most of Scotland and Wales, the Northern Planning-Region? Merseyside and most of Cornwall and North Devon,Details of these areas were specified in the Schedule to theDevelopment Areas Order 1966, which is reproduced at the end ofthis paper, and a map showing their boundaries appears in thesepages.U. The Development Areas now account for roughly 20^ ofemployment in manufacturing industry in Great Britain, and for about the same percentage of total employment.     In additionto the areas of high unemployment, they include some parts of britain, such as the Scottish Borders and mid-Wales, which have experienced a high level of net outward migration - reflectingin part lack of diversified employment opportunities rather thanhigh unemployment.12. The policies developed since the war, in conjunction with private initiative and effort, have led to the establishment and expansion of many major projects in the Development Areas -chemical plants, synthetic fibre factories, motor works, to namea few - and a whole host of other enterprises.      The industrialclimate of the Development Areas is being transformed.      Inspite of this, arid because the contraction of the olderindustries has gone on side by side with the growth of the new,since the war and up to 1966 unemployment rates in what are now the Development Areas remained in general at something liketwice the national average.

The standard rate of grant forall these items is 20$.- as a temporary measure this has been increased to 25$ for expenditure incurred in 1967 and 1968.In order to maintain a greater incentive to investment in development Areas, the rate of grant for eligible plant ormachinery, mining works and certain computers was fixed at 4-0$$and this Development Area rate of grant has been increased to for expenditure incurred in 1967 and 1968.      In contrast with the plant and machinery grants previously available in thedevelopment districts, the new investment grants are not-dependent on the provision of additional employment.      The factthat investment grants (unlike the tax allowances which theyreplace) do not depend on the level of profits of a firm can also be of particular assistance to new enterprises set up in development Areas.     The Exchequer expend it Lire involved in the extra 20$ on the grants for Development Area investment isabout  40 million a year at current rates of investment.15. Further important assistance is given under the local employment Acts for projects which are expected to provide newjobs in Development Areas.     This employment-linked assistance(as distinct from investment grants, which are given irrespective6
oEOiiEI UNTIL 00.30 HOURS ON 5TH APRIL, 1967.of trie employment created) may take a number of forms -general-purpose loans or grants;    grants for buildings or foradaptions or extensions to buildings;    or the provision ofGovernment-built factories for sale or rent at advantageous terms.     Any project providing employment in the development areas can be considered for these loans and grants, subject tothe recommendation of an independent Advisory Committee,     TheBoard of Trade&apos;s ability to offer assistance has been extendedboth by a widening of the range of inducements under theIndustrial Development Act and by the introduction of the widerdevelopment areas, and it is anticipated that the Department mayspend over  50 million on these programmes in the year 1967-68,16. Since the Government&apos;s measures of economic restraint ofJuly 1966, the relative position of the Development Areas as awhole, as reflected in the unemployment figures, has notdeveloped so unfavourably as in previous periods of restraint.There are indications that the intensified regional policies ofrecent years are having an increasing effect,  and that a higher proportion of total new industrial investment is going to theDevelopment Areas.      This is suggested by a recent shift in thebalance between the Development Areas and the rest of thecountry in approvals given for industrial building.     This trendhas still to produce its full effects,&apos;1 as have the most recentmeasures under the 1966 legislation.     Even though there will bea further and not wholly predictable run-down in the olderindustries, which has to be set against the new employmentresulting from these measures, progress in narrowing the gap between the regions can be hoped for over the next few years.Nevertheless,  on a careful assessment of the prospects,  it isimpossible to foresee with confidence more than a limitedreduction in the disparity in unemployment levels between the

In what follows, the term rejg^iojial^^ej^JIoj^ejritr^mmi is used for these proposed extra payments,19, Payments on this basis would be equal to about 5$ - 10$ oflabour costs.     If one took a figure midway in this range forpurposes of illustration, the total payments of regional employment premium for manufacturing establishments in thepresent Development Areas would be roughly  100 million a year,20. Legislation would be needed, and some adjustments would naturally have to be made to the Ministry of Labour&apos;s existingadministrative arrangements for making selective employmentpayments.     However, provided that the regional employment premium was confined to those categories of employers in development Areas who already receive the manufacturers premium,there should be no major difficulty from the point of technical feasibility and no substantial increase in administra-tive costs.21. The remainder of this paper sets out the economic case infavour of the proposed regional employment premiumj    discussessome of the counter-arguments;    and goes on to explore some ofthe other questions which would have to be considered,including the geographical scope of the premium, its industrialeffects, and some problems arising within-the Development Areas. he. Economic Case22. The economic case for the proposal rests on three mainpropositions s-^irsjb, that the efficient management of the economy and theoptimum use of manpower require major new measures to betaken to produce a more even distribution of industrialdevelopment as between the different regions, and as aresult to secure a further substantial narrowing of theunemployment gap between the Development Areas and therest of Britain;P. , secret UNTIL 00.30 HOURS ON J5TH APRIL, 1967.

If it has been in surplussupply in the Development Areas, that is because of the unevendistribution of demand for labour.     When the level of national economic activity has been relatively high, the pressure of demand for labour in the centres of maximum employment,especially the South and the Midlands, has built up from time totime to very high levels, with consequent and well-knowninflationary effects and damage to the balance of payments.    even at these times the degree of unemployment in the development areas has represented a waste of scarce human resources.     Whenaction has become imperative to restrain the pressure of demand in the areas of high employment - and because this has involvedmeasures affecting the whole economy - then unemployment in theDevelopment Areas has been pushed up to an extent which has not proved acceptable for any length of time.      This has led to a reaction against the measures of restraint and to pressure forrelaxations.

In the next ten years the number of people of working ageis not going to change appreciably, while the number of dependants will increase.    There will therefore be an even greater need for the nation to make use of its full potentiallabour force.    But the scope for doing this, without are currence of the conditions of excess demand which have led to balance-of-payments difficulties in the past, will be limitedunless a more even distribution of the demand for labourthroughout the country can be achieved.    The more even thedemand for labour, the higher can be total national employment without inflationary consequences and without prejudicing thebalance of payments.Would it work?26.   The regional premium payments would he designed to producethis effect by reducing the labour costs of manufacturing industry in the Development Areas, thus making it more competitive and enabling it over a period of time to Increase itsrelative share of the total output of manufacturing industry in britain.    For this,,  it would be essential that the premiumpayments should go primarily into reducing costs and pricesrather than into extra wage increases.    This gain incompetitiveness would put existing manufacturers in theDevelopment Areas in a position to increase output and employment,while other firms would have an additional inducement to set upthere.    National firms with branches both in the development areas and in the rest of the country would have an incentive to expand production in the former.    In the longer run these developments could have a cumulative effect in generating fastereconomic growth in the Development Areas, and the serviceindustries there would also stand to benefit from the secondaryeffects of the measure.    It should also in time lead to a
1 2reduction in the net outward migration from the development areas.27,   The proposal is not advanced as a short-term eontracyclicalmeasure.    Though there should he some immediate impact, on thewhole it is believed that the effects in the very short-termwould be rather limited.    But over a period of, say, 3-5 years it could narrow the unemployment gap very substantially.    any estimate on this point is bound to be highly speculative hut,subject to this important reservation, examination suggests that,with a premium of the size indicated in paragraph 18, theaverage disparity between unemployment in the Development areas and the country as a whole might be reduced by something likeone half over a period of years, over and. above the degree ofsuccess expected from existing programmes.    The speed at whichthis improvement took place would depend; among other things, onthe extent to which the increase in output in the development areas required additional investment to go with the employmentof additional labour.28.   The proposed assistance towards labour- costs would act inconjunction with the existing incentives to capital investment.It would help to meet the criticism which is sometimes levelledagainst special regional investment incentives that,  in theabsence of assistance towards labour costs, they tend to tip thebalance in favour of locating capital-intensive projects in areas of labour surplus rather than in areas of labour shortage.The investment grants by themselves could not be further raised to produce an additional stimulus comparable with the effect ofthe proposed employment premium - if only because the total ofcapital expenditure capable of attracting grant is much smaller than the labour costs which would attract employment premium.In manufacturing industry the annual wage and salary bill is
13JSiSSM?. jnrciL 00*30.. hours oh 5ti-i april, 1967.SSCPJiT ...UITTIL 00.30 HOURS oh 5T,i april, 1967.about five times the total annual investment and about seventimes the annual investment in machinery.Durat i on^and Amount29.   The regional employment premium is not put forward as apermanent new feature of regional policies, but it would not be worth while, nor effective as an inducement to new industry,unless some assurance could be given that it would continue fora period of years.    This should, be such as to allow time notonly for the premium to be fully reflected in the performance ofexisting Development Area factories, but also for new factories to be built in the Development Areas with an assurance ofpremium for a reasonable pay-off period.    On this basis, if thescheme were put into effect, it should- be with the intention ofmaintaining it for not less than, say, five years.    the objective would, be to taper the arrangements off and eventuallyeliminate them when the present disparities have been substantially reduced and their recurrence need no longer be feared.    (The question of winding up the premium arrangements is discussed further in paragraph ho.)30.     The size of the regional premium should ideally bedetermined at whatever figure was judged likely to be most effective in reaching this goal within this kind of time span.In practice a figure at the upper end of the range of  1  to  2a man per week, which was mentioned earlier on, would, probablybe regarded as excessive.    But, if the figure were whittled downtoo far, it might still raise all the practical issues which adecision in favour of the scheme would entail without holding out the same promise of a major advance in regional policies.Egging for the Premium31.   The way is now clear to consider the final proposition which
completes the case for the proposal on. economic grounds.    Thisconcerns the financing of the premium.    The regional premiumwill? of course j have to be paid for in the sense that theExchequer will have to provide funds for the scheme paid account for them as it must do for all programmes of Governmentexpenditurej  old or new.    But this in itself does hot determine the question whether additional taxation would- have to be raisedspecifically to finance the regional premium.32.   Any subsidy tends to increase demand and. output.    In thenormal way, unless the situation was ripe for an increase in total demand on resources including imports, it would benecessary,  other things being equal, to donsider financing any new grant payments by taxation or by some other means (such as a cut in other expenditure) which would produce an offsettingreduction in demand and thus free resources for the purpose.  .33.   But there are strong grounds for holding that this wouldbe an exceptional ease in which special measures to finance thescheme by taxation would not be necessary.    These argumentsare inherent in the very case for a regional employment premiumfor manufacturing industry, because it is part of this case thatthe rise in d.emand and. output in the Development areas would be accompanied by some shift in demand and output away from therest of Britain.    Although it is believed that the combined effect would, be a net increase in the national product, thereshould be some slackening of pressure of demand for labour inthe South and Midlands which would, mean that this could occurwithout an inflationary chain reaction.    Provided that the premium was confined, to the manufacturing sector, It is believedthat the net effect on imports and exports produced by the changes in demand and output in the Development Areas on the onehand, and in the rest of Britain on the other, should not involve any worsening in the balance of payments.
15On this analysis - in which once again the assumption isimplicit that the premium payments would not he swallowed up byextra wage increases - then neither balance-of-paymentsconsiderations nor the need to contain the pressure of demand would require taxation or other measures specifically to finance the extra premium in the Development Areas.    Indeed to the extent that the scheme succeeded in helping to produce a more evendistribution of employment,  thus making possible a lower nationalunemployment rate, it might in time enable the general level oftaxation to be lower than it would have been in the absence ofthe scheme.35.   It must be stressed that this analysis does not hold goodfor other measures which are designed to increase employment inthe Development Areas but which do not have a similar directeffect on manufacturing costs and on the distribution of demand.For instance,  it could certainly not be argued that higherexpenditure on investment in the Development Areas need not be accompanied by arrangements for extra financing or that, if theywere not so accompanied, damage could be avoided to the balanceof payments.^gjBff--Q,0AL^tjJlrArgumentis36.   Clearly there is room for differences of judgment on a$umber of points in the analysis thus far.    Some of these are considered briefly below, but no attempt is made to cover inadvance all the ground which is likely to be gone over in detailed discussion of the issues.37.   First, the premise that a radical new approach is needed maybe Questioned.    It may be argued that, when the present periodof readjustment   is over, a progrersive improvement in the economic position of the country as a whole,  combined with a relative
16improvement in the Development Areas as a result of existing programmes; will result in employment levels which would reducethe necessity for major new discriminatory measures.    Theeconomic case for the premium proposal does not, however,  standor fall by the prospect of any particular unemployment figuressince, whatever the precise figures, a more even distributionof unemployment would secure a fuller use of total manpower,and would make it that much the more possible to run the economy at a lower total unemployment rate without overheatingin the Midlands and the South and the consequent chain reactionaffecting cost levels and the balance of payments:.38.   Next, it may be argued that the economic advantages of thescheme to the country would at least in part be offset by encouraging the siting of industry in locations where its grosscosts (before receipt of the premium payments) might be permanently higher.    If there is validity in this point, itmust arise in connection with any effective measure, existing or new, to steer industry to the Development Areas.    It is,  ofcourse, a question of balancing the costs against the benefits,including the gain from bringing otherwise idle manpower intouse, from a national point of view.    In the case of theproposed regional premium, the upper limit on the differentialcosts of firms which might be induced by this scheme to go intothe Development Areas would be represented by the amount of the premium payments;    otherwise the premium would not be sufficientto induce them to move.    The benefits to be set against thesecosts would include the gain to the management of the economy,which cannot be quantified, and the net addition to nationalemployment and output.    The premium proposal is based on an assessment that on both counts there would be a substantialbalance of advantage to the country as a whole.
SECRET UNTIL GO.30 HOURS 5TH APRIL,  196?^5,   It may &quot;be argued that the foregoing discussion does not take adequate account of the importance of a continued flow of manpower through migration into the more favourable locationsfor industry, and of the brake which would bo placed on expansionthere if this flow were substantially reduced.   But there are anumber of factors to be set against this;    quite apart from theproblems involved in the disruption of families and thesettlement of the workers who have to move into already congestedareas, a serious loss can be inflicted on the areas losingmanpower, where outward migration may fail to reduce unemployment and may even increase it.    Por the loss of population canresult in a reduction in local demand and the process of declinemay tend to be cumulative.IlO.   Nevertheless, the point may still be made that, ifDevelopment Area firms were competitive from a commercial pointof view only with the assistance of the regional premium,  this could create serious difficulties when the time came to reduceor remove the premium.    There is, of course, no inherentreason why Development Area enterprises,  once fully launched,should not make their own way without continuing assistance.The question raised is whether a marginal project or a marginalincrease in output which owed its existence to the premium inthe first instance would be able to survive curtailment of the premium.    Clearly there is a problem here, but the premiumproposal has been put forward in the belief that it can be substantially overcome by the gains in productivity which should follow from a faster rate of development and a higher throughput.Moreover,  it is not unrealistic to expect that the operation ofthe premium for,  say, five years,, together with continuation ofexisting regional measures,  should improve the structure ofindustry and raise the level of economic activity in the17
18SECRET UNTIL 00.30 HOURS 5TH APRIL,  1967Development Areas to an extent which would make them much morecapable of adjustment to change,jpj:.   Finally, the realism of the assumption that the premiumpayments would gc primarily into improving the competitive-position of Development Area manufacturers, and not bedissipated in wage increases, may be questioned.    However,against the background of the relatively large unused labourresources in the Development Areas, there should, be room for an appreciable rise in the demand for labour in those areas without causing excessive pressure on wage levels.    Moreover, bothsides of industry would have a responsibility to co-operate in ensuring that the object of the scheme - a reduction in labour costs - was not frustrated.    It would- be equally essentialthat this reduction in labour costs should, be reflected in more competitive prices;    experience suggests that in fact reducedcosts are generally reflected in lower prices over a period oftime.Geographij^d^Sg^ope^of the SchemeU2,   The present Development Areas were announced, in the white paper on Investment Incentives in January 1966 (Cmnd, 287h)?They were determined by the Board of Trade in accordance withthe provisions of the Industrial Development Act, 1366, whichstate that the Development Areas wshall be those parts of GreatBritain where, in the opinion of the Board, special measures arenecessary to encourage the growth and- proper distribution ofindustry;    and in exercising their powers  , o ., , , * ,, 0 .the Board shall have regard to all the circumstances actual andexpected., including the state of employment and unemployment7population changes, migration and. the objectives of regionalpolicies1&apos;.
19SECRET UNTIL 00.30 HOURS 5TH APRIL,  1 967^3,   Under this legislation it is possible to make ordersadding places to the initial list of Development Areas, or taking them off the list.    These powers have not yet &quot;been used and the proposal for a regional employment premium has been worked out on the basis that it would be introduced in theDevelopment Areas as they are now,  or with only limitedboundary adjustments in exceptional cases, being designed to reinforce the existing measures of assistance for theDevelopment Areas,hlx.   Because the regional employment premium v/ould substantiallyincrease the extent of the preferential treatment accorded tothe Development Areas, it would inevitably lead to increasedrepresentations for similar treatment on behalf of other areas.But it v/ould not be possible to satisfy demands for asubstantial extension of the Development Areas without dilutingthe preference for the existing Development Areas and reducingthe effectiveness of the scheme in remedying their special problems.    This is a difficulty which will have to be takeninto account in reaching a decision on the proposed regional employment premium.Ij5.   Similarly it will be necessary to take into account the implications for the productivitj;- and efficiency of industry inthe rest of Britain, as well as in the Development Areas.    Itmust be recognised that the advantages of the premium for manufacturing industry in the Development Areas would have,  asthe opposite side of the coin,  some relative disadvantage for manufacturing industry in other areas.    The effects would vary from industry to industry and from case to case.    In some industries production is largely concentrated in particularparts of the country,  so that the Development Areas and other
SECRET UNTIL 00-30 HOURS 5TH APRIL,  1967regions are hardly in competition.    In other cases there arefirms with establishments both inside and outside theDevelopment Areas.    But there would bo cases where,  to theextent that the regional premium enabled industry in theDevelopment Areas to increase its share of the market,  industryelsewhere would tend to have a reduced share - though in the longer run economic activity in these other areas would benefitif a more even distribution of employment enabled the countryto run with a lower national unemployment figure, which wouldmean a bigger total domestic market.h6.   The potential effects on industry generally outside theDevelopment Areas should not be exaggerated.    No more Is claimedfor the proposed regional premium than that it should reducethe above-average unemployment, without wholly eliminating It,in 20% of the country - measured in terms of manufacturingemployment - in which case the obverse effects spread over theremaining 80% of the country would be correspondingly limited.Nevertheless this is clearly another factor which will have to tie carefully weighed.Pr ob 1 ems wijbh.in,pthep DeveLlPJ^epptp-Ar; e a,s47;.   Within the Development Areas,  the proposed regional premiumwould accentuate the present differentiation between manufacturingestablishments which already attract the-existing selective employment premium and, on the other hand, those establishmentswhich bear selective employment tax without refund.    This, too, ma;well be regarded as a point of difficulty, though in fact alleconomic activity in the Development Areas would stand to benefitindirectly through the increased prosperity which the regional employment premium would be designed to generate.20
21SECRET UNTIL 00.30 HOURS 5TH APRIL,  1967^8,   This increased differentiation might lead to renewedsuggestions that refunds of selective employment tax should he paid in respect of employment in the service industries in theDevelopment Areas.    But a main object of introducing this taxwas to broaden the tax base by selective imposition of the tax on the service industries, which are not subject to the purchase tax and revenue duties levied on the output of manufacturing industries.    It would be difficult to accept that there shouldbe a narrower tax base in the Development Areas.    The incidence of the tax on the Development Areas taken together is much thesame as on the country as a whole, and there do not seem to beany strong grounds for criticisms that the tax runs counter tothe Governments general regional policies.   A wide range ofeconomic activity in the Development Areas should benefitdirectly or indirectly from measures of assistance to manufacturing industry;    to pay refund of selective employment tax in respect of service activities in the Development areas would involve further large amounts Y/ithout contributing to continue growth in the Development Areas on a comparable scale.The basic economic reason for this is that the market for mostservices is to a large extent a local one, and refund of the taxfor service establishments in the Development Areas would give them little competitive advantage over services in other partsof Britain or abroad - retailers in Glasgow, for instance, arenot in direct competition with retailers in Birmingham oroverseas.    The payments of refund to service establishments,unlike the premium payments to manufacturers, would not addsignificantly to real output in the Development Areas, but would add to purchasing power in those areas;    part of this would be spent on the products of other areas and on imports,  and theseeffects on demand and the balance of payments might require some
22SECRET UNTIL 00,30 HOURS 5TH APRIL.,  1967offsetting increase in taxation.    Apart from these economic arguments, the registration for refund of all serviceestablishments in the Development Areas would add substantialadministrative complexity to the arrangements.1l9,   The Development Areas include some parts where an exceptionally small proportion (from 10% to 15%) of the totalnumber of employees are in manufacturing industry.    The SouthWest Development Area - which covers only a part of the SouthWest administrative region - the Scottish Highlands and islands, mid-Wales and North West Wales are in this category.A high proportion of employment in these sub-regions is inagriculture and other occupations which attract refund of selective employment tax, and a further proportion of theworking population is self-employed and therefore does not paythe tax.    Nevertheless, although statistics of the incidence of the selective employment tax are not compiled on a sub-regional basis,  it is clear that the net yield of the tax as a percentage of the wage and salary &quot;bill must he rather higher in these sub-regions than it is either in Britain as a whole orin the Development Areas as a whole.50.   It does not follow that the considerations set out earlieron against relief from the tax for service industries in thewhole of the Development Areas have any &quot;the less force withregard to these sub-regions, and it is equally doubtful whether their special problems would be nearer a solution as a resra.lt ofsuch reliefs.    What is true, of course,  is that the proposedregional employment premium would not provide a solution inthese sub-regions (though they would share with the rest of theDevelopment Areas the additional inducement for the establishmentof new manufacturing projects) any more than the existingselective employment premium does.    But it would not be a
23reasonable criticism of either the existing arrangements or theproposed new premium, both designed to help growth in manufacturing industry, that they do not do the job which theyare not meant to do of promoting development in parts of the.country where the proportion of manufacturing industry is low and cannot be rapidly increased.51 ,   It is more constructive to look at the problems of these areas with a view to making the most of the kind of resources and potentialities which they do possess.    This is precisely the role of the Highlands and Islands Development Board, whichis engaged in an expanding programme for the development oftourist facilities and other enterprises.    The potential ofother primarily rural parts of the Development Areas throughoutthe country,  including the scope for further encouragement ofthe facilities for tourism,  is being carefully examined by theDepartments concerned.Northern Ireland52,   In Northern Ireland collection of the selective employment tax and the premium and refund, arrangements are theresponsibility of the Northern Ireland, authorities, as are thevarious programmes for industrial development.    It is to beexpected that, if regional employment premium were introduced inthe rest of the United Kingdom,  the Northern Ireland Governmentwould wish to apply similar arrangements to manufacturing industry there.    If it proved difficult to accommodate this measure within the existing financial arrangements between the exchequers of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, it cante assumed that there would&apos;be consultation on this point.Conclusion53.   To sum up, this memorandum has set out the case on economic grounds for believing that the operation of a regional employment
2h^ SECRET UNTIL 00.30 HOURS ljTE APRILpremium for a period of years in the Development Areas, at separately probably within the range of  1 to  2 a week per man in manufacturing establishments, should help to bring about asubstantial reduction in the disparity between -unemployment there and in the rest of Britain, and accelerate the progress in thisdirection which is hoped for from the development of existing programmes.     Clearly a more even distribution of employment would represent a great gain in the management of the economy axd the fuller use of manpower.     At the same time,, the scheme wouldinvolve a heightened differentiation between different parts ofthe country and the industries in them,  and the report has indicated some points of difficulty which would arise on that account.5k-.   In economic affairs there can hardly over be a course ofaction - whether it involves intervention or refusal to intervene -which is free from drawbacks.     It is for the Government todecide whether the balance of advantage for the nation would justify them in submitting a proposal for legislation toParliament.     Consultation and public discussion will not causereal points of difficulty to disappear, but they should lead tobetter understanding of the issues and they will enable theGovernment to take reactions to the proposal into account.Consultation with both sides of industry will also be important in ensuring that, if the suggested regional employment premium is introduced, it goes forward in a way best designed to achieve the objectives of improving the competitive position of manufacturing industry in the Development Areas, with a consequent raising oftheir levels of employment and rates of economic development.
