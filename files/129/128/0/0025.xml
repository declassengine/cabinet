[S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C(67) 25 COPY NO. .    ^ ^10th March, 1967CABINETHOUSING; PUBLIC AUTHORITY HOUSING PROGRAMME 1967ENGLAND AND wales memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentand the Secretary of State for wales the Prime Ministers Group on Housing has been consideringthe level of the housing programme.    The immediate and crucial issue is the level of the 1967 local authority programme in England and Wales.2.     At the last election we were firmly committed as a Party to thebuilding of 500, 000 houses in 1970.    So far we have not succeeded in building at a rate that will ensure that the 1970 target (based on ourassessment of the nation s housing needs) will be reached.    In 1963299,000 houses were completed in Great Britain, in 1964 374, 000, in1965 382, 000, in 1966 385, 000 and we may not reach 400, 000 this year.3,     In the public sector, completions this year and next year will beup because of a rise in the allocations in 1965 and 1966.    They will be helped by the specially increased allocation made last year but against this the future level of private completions is very uncertain.4.     The programme of approvals endorsed by^ Ministers for this year,however, falls short of last year&apos;s total of approvals by 4, 000.    Inaddition, an extra 3,000 approvals will be needed for houses for miners.The effect of these two factors is to reduce the local authorityprogramme by 7, 000.5.     Good planning requires telling local authorities of their programme of approvals well in advance of the time they should, lettenders.    Indeed, for efficient operation, they should be told this inthe autumn of the year before.    Against this timetable, we are alreadylate in settling their programmes and they will therefore be pressingvery strongly over the next few weeks to know how many tenders theymay expect to be approved this year.    We shall have to tell them.When we come to fix their figures, if the present year&apos;s allocation isnot increased, we cannot avoid difficult and unpleasant choices.6.     in the past we have told priority areas (141 out of about 1,400local authorities) to build to capacity.    We estimate that these areas are able and anxious to put into tender at least 10, 000 more houses thisyear than in 1966.    If we honour our promises to these areas, a very heavy cut must fall upon the non-priority areas for with the programme already reduced by 7, 000, the total cut falling upon them would become-1-
17, 000.    It would probably be impossible to make a cut of this brutalseverity, for non-priority is only a relative term - some of the worstslums are in the non-priority areas even though the absolute numbers are not great.    The difference between priority and non-priority isto a large extent one of scale rather than need.    The consequencewould be that, as well as making some cuts in the non-priority areas,we should have to put limits on the priority areas programmes.7.      All these cuts would become public over the next few weeks and could have grave political effects which would be aggravated becausethey were being made at a time v/hen there was spare capacity in thebuilding industry,.     ...8.       It is true that the private sector looks at the moment to be doinga little better, but it has a long way to go even to match the performancein 1964/65 and even farther to m&amp;J?s Its expected contribution to thehousing target in 1970,    The prospects are not such as to justifyrepression now in the level of local authority programmes.    We need to make good the dip in this year&apos;s allocation - 4, 000 housesj provide3, 000 to cover the houses needed for miners;  and to add another 5, 000to allow a modest increase and to make the limitations on the localauthority programme politically bearable.    We are therefore asking foran increase of 12, 000 in this year&apos;s allocations.9.       This issue was considered by the Prime Minister&apos;s Group on housing on our proposal that the programme for 1967 should beincreased by 12, 000,    The meeting expressed wide support for anincrease of 3, 000 to offset the additional houses required for miners,though the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not at that stage feel able to commit himself.    There was also a measure of support (we believeconsiderable) for authorising an increase of 7, 000 which would maintainapprovals at the same level as in 1966 and would also compensate for theadditional houses required for miners;  the Chancellor of the Exchequer,however, argued strongly against an increase of this order on public expenditure grounds.10.       To sum up.    To maintain the credibility of our housing objectiveswe should be seen to be making significant progress towards them in thepublic as well as the private sector.    The present public sectorprogrammes would oblige us to take open action to keep the level ofthe local authority programme below that of last year and below whatthey are able and willing to do.    This would be bound to lead to political difficulties at both the national and local levels.11.       In our view, an extra 12, 000 approvals is needed to avoidembarrassment.    In the light^however, of the discussions in the PrimeMinisters Group we would reluctantly accept that the question of theadditional 5, 000 (paragraph 8) be left over for consideration towards theend of the year.    Of the balance of 7, 000, half would be started thisyear and the rest next year leading to about 1, 750 extra completions in 1968 and about 3,250 extra in 1969.    The programme so increasedwould provide jobs for 7,000 workers,    7, 000 extra approvals in 1967-2-
will increase housing Investment expenditure by an estimated 27. 5 million spread as follows -1967/68        1968/69 11*211$. 9.1m.  11.4 m,,  7.0 m.They would eventually increase Exchequer housing subsidies by about 0.6 million a year with effect from 1969/70.12. We accordingly ask our colleagues to authorise now an increaseof 7, 000 in vhe local authority programme in 1967.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, Sk W.l.10th March, 5.967-3-
