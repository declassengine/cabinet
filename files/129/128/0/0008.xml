HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)COPY NO, -    6216th January, 1967CABINETPOSSIBLE INCREASES IN FAMILY ALLOWANCES FORLAPvGER FAMILIES IN 1967-68Memorandum by the Minister of Social SecurityAt their meeting of 20th December, 1966 (CC(66) 67th Conclusions,Mimite 7) the Cabinet invited me to circulate a memorandum on possibleincreases in family allowances for larger families, to operate in 1967-68,including particulars of their cost and their effect on families paying the proposed higher charges for school meals and welfare milk.    TheChancellor of the Exchequer has indicated (C(66) 158, paragraph 14) his willingness to support a means-tested scheme of family endowment costing about  10 million in 1967-68, and I have assumed that this represents the approximate level of expenditure available for an interim increase in family allowances in that year.    It remains my view that an interim increase in family allowances for larger families would not be politically viable unlessthe Government announced at the same time the intention to introduce a&quot;give and take1 scheme to operate in 1968, and this paper has been written on the assumption that this view is accepted by my colleagues.Possible Timetables2.       The possible dates in 1967-68 from which increases could operateare;(a)    From the end of October,, that is, concurrently with the generaluprating of national insurance and supplementary benefitsapproved for that month.    This would call for an announcementnot later than the end of June, and legislation to be passed by theend of July.    (It would of course be possible to make a generaldeclaration of intention well before the Bill was published if this were thought desirable).    The necessary legislation would be incorporated in the Bill providing for the uprating of national insurance and other benefits, and the adjustment of national insurance dependency rates and supplementary benefitsdownward to take account of the increase in family allowances,and upwards as part of the general uprating, could be carriedout as a single operation.
(b)    From some time between the beginning of July and mid-SeptemberThis would entail separate legislation.    On the assumption thatan announcement would not be made before the Budget,legislation would need to be completed between the Budget andthe end of May, if the increases were to operate from, theearliest possible date, the beginning of July,    legislation would have to be completed in any event by mid&quot;? June, even ifthe appointed day were deferred to a date in August orSeptember, because at least the greater part of the work on aseparate family allowances uprating should be completed beforework on the general uprating of national insurance and supplementary benefits begins.    The uprating is effected by over stamping the orders in the books from the date on which itis decided the increase will operate.    To impose an apparentlyartificial delay upon payment of the increase beyond July might give rise to criticism.A difficulty with a separate family allowances increase is that it involves a downrating of national insurance dependency and supplementary benefits(for families receiving the higher family allowances), followed by anincrease in these benefits at the end of October at the general uprating:the nearer to the general uprating the increase in family allowances ismade effective, the less supportable this double adjustment of benefitswill appear.    For this reason an effective date for a separate operationlater than mid-*Septembe r seems out of the question.    It would also bedesirable that the date from which increased family allowances v/erepayable should not be so close to early September, the date proposed for higher charges for school meals and welfare milk, that the increasedallowances were generally regarded as a quid pro quo:  as, if they were so regarded, it would be difficult to subsume them into any general increase of family allowances under a &apos;give and take&apos; scheme introduced in 1968.    Moreover, an increase in family allowances taking effectearlier than the general uprating of other benefits would give no advantage to people in receipt of national insurance dependency or supplementary benefits, since these would be reduced by the amount of the family allowances increases  if, however, family allowances were increasedconcurrently with the general uprating, such people would be better off by the amount of the increase in the other benefits.Possible Scope and Amount of Increase3.       To benefit larger families, an increase in family allowances couldbe paid either for third and subsequent or fourth and subsequent children.If there was to be a general increase of family allowances in April 1968 aspart of a &quot;give and take&apos; scheme, any interim increase for larger families in 1967-68 should be limited to a maximum of 5s. , so as not to compromisethe amount of the later increase.    Moreover, an increase of more than5s. for fourth and subsequent children might be thought to produce toowide a gap between families with less than four children and those withfour or more.-2-SECRET
4.       The cost of alternative schemes in 1967-68, after allowing for the downward adjustment of national insurance dependency and supplementary benefits, would be;(a)     Appointed day 31st October4s, for third and subsequent children;5s, for fourth and subsequent children; 10 million  5 million(b)     Appointed day 4th July2s. for third and subsequent children;3s. for third and subsequent children;5s. for fourth and subsequent children:  9 million 13-1 million  9 million(c)     Appointed day 8th August (mid-point between 4th July and mid-September)2s. for third and subsequent children:   8 million3s. for third and subsequent children:  12 million5s. for fourth and subsequent children:        7-f- million5.       An increase in family allowances for third and subsequent children would go to about 24 per cent of the total number of all families (including one-child families);  and an increase for fourth and subsequent children to about 9 per cent of all families.    The corresponding figures for family allowance families, that is, families with two or more children, are about40 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.    An increase of 4s. for third and subsequent children would bring up to or above the supplementary benefit level about 12 per cent of the families (with 20 per cent of thechildren) which at present cannot reach it:  an increase of 5s. for fourth and subsequent children would bring up to or above that level about per cent of such families (with 11 per cent of the children).Effect on families paying higher charges for school meals and welfare milk6.       The combined effect upon families of various sizes of highercharges for school meals and welfare milk and increases in family allowances for larger families is set out in the Table attached.conclusion.       I invite my colleagues to consider whether family allowances for larger families should be increased as an interim measure in 1967-68.    as mentioned in the first paragraph above, I do not think that an increase in family allowances which we could afford would be politically possibleunless its announcement were linked with an announcement of a &apos;give andtake1 scheme to operate in 1968.    I suggest that the best of the alternativesset out in paragraph 4 above is to give 4s. increase for third and subsequent children, concurrently with the uprating of national insurancesupplementary benefits in October, 1967.    This would both avoid thedifficulties which would arise if there were an earlier and separateincrease in family allowances, and make it possible to give a reasonableamount to a sizeable proportion of the families receiving allowances.M.H.Ministry of Social Security, W.C.2.13th January, 1967-3-SECKET
