THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1967C (67) 10 Copy No.      g f)23rd January, 1967CABINETSONIC BANG TESTSMemorandum by the Minister of AviationWhen in July last the Cabinet considered the Concord project(C (66) 39th Conclusions, Item 4), my predecessor suggested(C (66) 116) that we should plan a programme of tests to help establish the likely reaction of the public to sonic bangs such as may beexpected when Concord and other supersonic transports (SSTs) comeinto service. I now seek approval for a programme of such tests andthe preparation of the legislation which the Attorney-General advisesis desirable before we embark on the tests.Cause and nature of sonic bangs2. The familiar noise from jet aircraft derives from the engines and is a nuisance only in and around airports but with sonic bangsthe reverse applies. Within about 100 miles of take-off or landingthe speed of the SST will be too low to cause a bang. When theaircraft reaches supersonic speed it produces a bang and continuesto do so for as long as it is flying supersonically. The bang thussweeps across the countryside over which the aircraft is flying. the size of the aircraft and the height at which it is intended to operateare the only design features which can have any major effect on the intensity of the bang. .,,Effects of sonic bang and the results of earlier tests3. Much is known about the effects of sonic bang fromtheoretical studies, the incidental experience gained from flyingmilitary aircraft supersonically, and from tests directed specifically to the problem. We know that intensities far greater than thoseexpected from normal operations by SSTs have to be reached beforedamage to well-constructed buildings definitely attributable to sonicbangs occurs. There is no real evidence that sonic bangs of theintensities expected are harmful to the health of people or animals.The main reason for anxiety about sonic bangs is that some people would find them so disturbing and alarming that they would consider them intolerable.4. Much work has already been done on the problem of sonicbangs most notably in America where there were extensive tests7553A
over Oklahoma City in 1964, but also in France and the UnitedKingdom. This work is summarised in the Appendix to this paper.There has been considerable interchange of information betweenthe three countries. In all three countries, experts believe that further tests are required if their Governments are to be able toexpress with confidence views on the nature and extent of the limitations which Governments around the world may find itnecessary to impose if the sonic bang nuisance is to be kept withintolerable bounds. Even if there were no Concord, we would stilleventually have to decide our attitude to overflights of UnitedKingdom territory by foreign SSTs and to restrictions by foreign government on overflights of their territory by SSTs operated byBritish airlines. If these were the only considerations, I would stillthink it desirable although not vital to have major tests of our own.But our participation in Concord makes it in my view essential forus to carry out such tests. I do not see how we could continuepolitically to defend our inaction in this matter, with the first flightof Concord planned for the spring of 1968. We must be able toshow the world, and public opinion at home, that as one of theprogenitors of SSTs we are taking this matter seriously.French proposals. In August 1966 the French Government set up an interdepartmental committee to prepare a programme of possibletests to determine public tolerance to sonic bangs and to considerthe implications of carrying out such a programme. The Committeeis expected to produce shortly a report:(a) setting out the costs of the programme;(b) assessing the risks to persons and property, the effects inthe field of public health and employment, and the social and legal aspects of the programme;(c) defining the steps to be taken for the necessary preservation of historic monuments;(d) proposing possible areas for the tests;(e) describing the organisation of a public relations campaigndirected towards those involved;(/) defining the possible contribution of the British, as partners in the Concord project.Despite the rather tentative tone of the above, we know that theFrench have already given much thought to the points mentioned, as indeed have our own officials. We may expect the French to come up with a positive programme. Although we can make noassumptions about its nature before the report appears it is likely that intensive studies of the effects of regular overland supersonicflying by military aircraft (which is permitted in France) wouldprecede a large scale test. Within the next few weeks we must expectthem, for the purposes of their report, to ask our own intentions.British and French officials have collaborated closely in this matterhitherto but, as regards the actual tests, there does not seem to bemuch scope for economy by division of labour, and the main
objective of further collaboration would be to ensure that the results could be readily compared. The combined evidence of separateBritish and French tests will be much greater than that of a purelynational test and will enable the two countries to work together indealing with others on the questions arising from the sonic bangsmade by civil supersonic aircraft-American and Russian, as well asConcord.Proposals for British tests6. Officials have worked out a tentative programme for testsin Britain, taking into account the points under consideration by theFrench interdepartmental committee. The proposed programme has been discussed with Departments having a special interest suchas the Ministry of Public Building and Works (Ancient Monuments),and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Animal Health),etc. The Board of Trade believe that the results of the tests willbe a considerable help to them in working out what regulations should be imposed on the overflying of supersonic aircraft.7. The central feature of the tests would be a programme ofsupersonic flights during the day by RAF Lightnings to producebangs of predetermined frequencies and intensities over specific areasover a period of several months. At first there would be about onebang a day at an intensity not likely to cause any reasonablecomplaint, and from there we would proceed gradually over a periodof six to nine months to about five bangs a day simulating, as closely as possible, bangs to be heard from Concord. (It will be appreciated that one type of aircraft cannot give an exact representation of bangsfrom a different type of aircraft.) The total number of bangs wouldbe of the order of 450.8. It would be desirable to enact legislation barring any legal proceedings in respect of test flights and providing statutorycompensation for any loss or damage caused by noise from theaircraft (see paragraph 12 below). In the Bill it would presumablybe necessary to define the area over which the tests will be carriedout and this is likely to give rise to political controversy.Unfortunately the choice of suitable areas is very limited: to gooutside these would add to the costs of the flying programme and make it difficult to integrate it with RAF training. For these reasons,the area would probably have to be in the North of England.The Ministry of Defence have indicated that Lightnings could beavailable at any time from the beginning of 1967, given a few months&apos;notice.9. The public relations aspects are crucially important and willrequire very careful study. Press and public should be kept as fully informed as possible, but exact details will have to be decided upon inthe light of the precise nature of the programme. Normally therewould be no specific warning of an individual bang.10. There would be a systematic social survey by the central office of Information of the reactions of the people exposed to thebangs, together with an analysis of any complaints. This would bea very important part of the exercise.7553
11. Throughout the tests there would be scientific measurementsof the bangs actually produced, pre-planned scientific experimentsrelating to the physical effects of the bangs (for example, on theirtransmission into buildings and reflection from the ground) andinvestigations of all reports of happenings attributed to the bangs.12. The timing of the tests is affected by the desirability oflegislation. The Attorney-General has advised that it would be undesirable for the Crown, without legislation, to initiate tests on alarge scale which would inevitably result in claims of damage to property and be a nuisance in law. Since one of the aims of the testsis to discover the limits of acceptability, we should be foolish to planthem on the basis of stopping far short of the possibility of causingany damage or legal nuisance. It is therefore desirable that parliamentary Counsel should be instructed to draft a short Bill whichwould:(a) give the Minister power to authorise by Order, subject tonegative resolution procedure (it may however benecessary to concede affirmative resolution procedure),flights for testing effects on the ground of flying atsupersonic speeds, such flights to be made over a specified period or periods and over specified areas ofthe United Kingdom (excluding Northern Ireland);(b) bar any legal proceedings (subject to (c) below) in respectof any such flights, in so far as they are based on noisefrom the aircraft or on the height at which the aircraftfly; and(c) to provide statutory compensation for any injury, loss or damage caused to any person or property by noise fromthe aircraft.13. It will be necessary to set up a staff to direct the preparation,execution, and evaluation of the tests a task which would take about18 months in all but some of the staff effort required would beprovided by existing units of organisation in the Departmentsinvolved.Costs14. The cost to the Ministry of Aviation of&apos; RAF flying (on an extra cost basis), instrumentation and investigation of any damageclaims, is estimated at  225,000, excluding any allowance forintramural staff effort. Compensation payments are more difficult toestimate; the best assessment is well within  100,000.Timing15. It is desirable that the legislation described in paragraph 12above should come into force before May of this year. Unless the tests have started by May, weather conditions could make it difficultto complete a test programme in 1967. The first Concord prototype isdue to fly in the spring of 1968. I think we should be open to criticism if we had not made substantial progress with tests by then. It is impracticable to wait for the Concord prototype and to use this forCONFIDENTIAL
sonic bang tests: it will be fully engaged in development flying, therequirements of which could not be matched with those of a sonicbang test programme.16. The other critical factor in the timing is the preparatory work necessary to carry out the social survey referred to in paragraph10 above. The Central Office of Information have advised that inorder to make the necessary arrangements they will need authorityfor the survey three months before the first bang, i.e., the beginningof February.17. I would have preferred colleagues to consider my sonicbang proposals at the same time as the report of the Anglo-french committee which has been reviewing the economic and commercial prospects of the Concord. This report has not yet been formallysigned but an advance copy which is unlikely to be changed is available (C (67) 11). My Department is examining this report asa matter of urgency but it will be some two to three weeks before i am able to make a considered report to colleagues. A decision onthe sonic bang test proposals however cannot for the reason explained above await our consideration of the report of the ConcordEconomic Prospects Committee. Nor can it be deferred until myDepartment has studied in detail the report, which should be availableshortly, of the French Inter-Departmental Committee on sonic bangtests. We will however be able to draw on the information in thisreport before our own tests begin.Recommendations18.   I accordingly seek the agreement of the Cabinet that:(a) Parliamentary Counsel should be instructed to draft thelegislation described in paragraph 12 with the aim of bringing it into force before May; and(b) the Central Office of Information should be authorised toprepare the survey referred to in paragraph 10 above.J. T. S.Ministry of Aviation, S.W.1,20th January, 1967.AppendixEXPERIMENTAL WORK ALREADY CARRIED OUT ONTHE EFFECTS OF SONIC BANGS1.  Oklahoma City study the most comprehensive tests so far have been carried out bythe Federal Aviation Agency in the Oklahoma City area between3rd February and 30th July, 1964. During that time 1,253 sonicbangs were made, starting at a very low intensity and increasing to
a level described as representative of civil supersonic aircraft in,normal flight.   Some results which emerged were:(a) A complaints centre dealt with 15,000 complaints including a number from people who complained more than once,i.e., 1,253 bangs heard each time by some 600,000 peoplebrought in about 80 complaints a day.(b) There was no damage to test houses.(c) A social survey was made.   This showed that annoyance had increased by the end of the experiment but as bothfrequency and intensity of bangs also increased by theend of the test period it was not possible to evaluate thisevidence.(d) There were no complaints from doctors or those in chargeof animals.2.   White Sands ProgrammeFollowing the Oklahoma City study, further tests on buildings were carried out at White Sands, New Mexico, from November 1964to February 1965. The object was to find out how intense bangs hadto be to cause damage. Seven specially constructed houses and nineexisting buildings were subjected to some 1,500 bangs of up to 10times the intensity expected from the Concord in normal flight. the pressure necessary to cause damage to sound structures amounted to four to five times the intensity likely to be produced by Concord.All those on duty at the test site were given daily audiometrictests and periodic physical examinations. There was no evidence of damage to hearing or adverse physiological effects.3.   Work in FranceStudies of reactions to sonic bangs have been carried out inconnection with military overland supersonic flying, which is permitted in France subject to altitude restrictions. In October-November 1965, a sample public opinion survey was carried out intwo areas with experience of sonic bangs from military aircraft. Animportant conclusion was that dislike of sonic bangs is less among those best informed about them.4.   Work in the United KingdomSmall-scale tests covering various aspects of the effects of sonicbangs have been carried out in this country. In general, the findings of these smaller experiments, and from analyses of response to testflying of military aircraft, are in accordance with the larger scaleAmerican experience.Ministry of Aviation establishments have conducted field testswith simulated sonic bangs. The longest of these, lasting 14 weeks,gave slight evidence that annoyance decreased as people becameused to bangs.Demonstrations of sonic bangs have been held at Aberporth on several occasions between 1961 and 1963, and at Upwood (ExerciseWestminster) in 1965.   There was some evidence of damage to
strained structures at Exercise Westminster, but the exercise did not give rise to any strong objection from the subjects, nor were any significant animal reactions reported by M. of A. F. and F. observers.Measurements of sonic bangs indoors as well as out of doorswere taken in Lyme Regis during operational Lightning flights inApril and May 1963.Laboratory studies of reactions to sonic bangs have been carriedout by the Medical Research Council Applied Psychology Unit, the institute of Sound and Vibration at Southampton and by the NationalPhysical Laboratory. These have tended to concentrate onidentifying the annoying features of bangs.The Building Research Station has a programme of experimentsdesigned to fill the remaining gap in our knowledge of the effects of bangs on structures, namely the effect on plate glass windows.5.   SummaryIt is clear that sound buildings should not be damaged byConcord-type sonic bangs, although strained materials may fail earlier than they would otherwise have done.There is no evidence of adverse effects on the health of human beings or animals.Experience in the three countries has shown that a proportionof the population will object to sonic bangs. We do not yet know the relation between this proportion and the intensity or frequency of bangs or their continuation over a long period.
