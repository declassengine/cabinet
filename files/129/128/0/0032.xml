L3OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT)p PboC(67) 32 COPY NO._14th March, 1967CABINET ,THE EUROPEAN AIR BUSMemorandum by the President o  the Board of trade the essence of the argument for a European air bus is that itoffers the only prospect of creating a European domestic market for large subsonic aircraft without which market neither we nor the Frenchcould hope to compete with the Americans in future.     It is argued thatit may be worth talcing some risks and bearing some costs to achieve this.2,       The report by officials attempts to calculate the economic consequences.     But there are so many variables and such insecurityin the figures that we cannot confidently base our decision on thefinancial factors.     The only conclusion that can safely be drawnis that unless British European Airways (BEA) have also an aircraft of intermediate size, there will be a substantial additional cost of supporting operations more uneconomic than they would otherwise be.    It is the implications as to the intermediate aircraft that causeme most concern.     This aircraft is needed both to bridge a gap in size and to make provision for BEA requirements before and afterthe air bus is available.3.       The choice of an intermediate size of aircraft, for which Iam satisfied there is a need, has been sadly delayed by our refusallast summer to permit the purchase of Boeings, and by the subsequentattempts by the manufacturers, in consultation with BEA, to evolve aBritish aircraft of roughly competitive characteristics.     BEA havenow formally asked for authority to order 30 BAC2-.11 aircraft withan option for 10 more with a &quot;new technology&quot; Rolls-Royce engine.This aircraft would, in the operators&apos; view, be of the right size,have good operating economies, and, being less noisy, give much better flexibility for use at night.    It could, however, be provided at an economic price only at the cost of the Government meeting largelaunching costs,    A good deal more work is required to establish thecase for the numbers needed and to make a reliable comparison withother possible aircraft so as to reach an overall judgment on merits.4.       I understand, however, that the Ministry of Technology advise that if we proceed with the air bus it is unlikely that Rolls-Royce could also develop the engine for the BAC2-11.    If this is really so, and weproceed with the air bus, we shall once again have to tell BEA thatthey cannot have, the aircraft of their choice, not on merits, but because it does not fit into our policies for the manufacturing industry.    Wehave already denied BEA the Boeing 727.    It is extremely difficultto preach efficiency to BEA if we repeatedly refuse the aircraft whichthey regard as suitable and economic,-1-
5,       I should therefore much prefer to arrive at a decision on meritsabout the intermediate aircraft before reaching conclusions about the longer-dated and less firm requirements for an air bus.    I do not feelthat the case for the air bus has yet been made out in terms of demand from potential users.    BEA as well as the British Aircraft Corporation(BAC) believe that, following the export success of the BAC1-11, a promising market could be secured outside the United Kingdom forthe BAC2-11, the development of which would be no less advantageoustechnologically than that of the air bus.6.       There is one other implication in relation to BEA to which i must draw attention,    I have no powers to instruct BEA to order theair bus.    If, therefore, they are to be firmly committed, they mustbe expected to seek an equally firm commitment from us that we willrelieve them of any dis-economies which may arise from their acceptance of a fleet conditioned by the necessity of taking a givennumber of air buses.     The undertaking given to them last summerthat they v/ould be put in a position to operate in a fully commercialfashion with the fleet they acquired related only to the demand thenunder consideration;  and they may well ask us to extend the guarantee to cover the air bus also if, at the same time, we insist that they take that aircraft while refusing them the BAC2-11,D.P.T.
