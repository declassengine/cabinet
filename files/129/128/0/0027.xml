,iENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.      n ,o onCABINETFAMILY endowment memorandum by the Lord President of the council the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s memorandum on family endowment (C(67) 23) raises an important issue of constitutional principle.When the Cabinet, on 23rd February (CC(67) 9th Conclusions, Minute 4),decided for the &quot;give and take&quot; scheme and against the Chancellor&apos;proposal for an income test, the Chancellor reserved his right &quot;to considerthe fiscal means by which a scheme of that kind should be financed&quot;.But in fact the fiscal means he recommends are tantamount to a rejection of &quot;give and take&quot;;  and his attempt to postpone a decision which cabinet has already firmly taken amounts to a demand that the decision should berescinded.    As the Minister for Social Security has made clear, adecision to postpone the preparatory steps needed for a &quot;give and take&quot;scheme might well mean that it could not be introduced in 1968.2.      I do not, of course, want to challenge the time-hallowed principleof the Chancellorrs control over the Budget.    But the application of this principle must be viewed in the light of modern economic managementon the one hand and on the other of the Cabinet&apos;s right to decide uponthe main lines of major economic policy and social reform.    Thereis no doubt that he must be able to decide in great secrecy on theparticular tax changes required in order to implement the Cabinet&apos;economic policy;  but I cannot think it proper that this traditional rightshould be extended to the point where the Chancellor requires a cabinet decision to be rescinded on the ground that it affects those budgetaryissues which are within his sole competence.     To concede this would go far to undermine the whole doctrine of collective Cabinet respon-sibility for economic and social policy.C(67) 2713th March, 19673.       The question of family endowment has been considered at lengthon two occasions by the Cabinet which has &quot;faced the issue of income-testing&quot; before reaching its conclusion that direct income-testing inthis field is not acceptable and that the limitation of the improved family allowances to the poorer families should be achieved by indirect income-testing.    It is not correct to say that the &quot;give and take&quot; scheme doesnot operate an income test;  it operates an income test of the better offthrough adjustment of their tax allowances and thus avoids the humiliationinevitable in any direct income-testing..4.      Nor am I impressed with the Chancellor&apos;s new argument that the&quot;give and take&quot; scheme costs  160 million which can only be found by cutting other social services.     This conclusion can only be reached by disregarding the relationship between tax allowances and government grants inherent in the &quot;give and take&quot; scheme.    I should have thought-1-
that on any reasonable calculation only the net annual cost of  32 million should be counted against the tolerable increase on taxation rates.     TheChancellor himself recognised the general validity of this point in hisWhite Paper on Public Expenditure (February, 1966 - Cmnd, 2915):&quot;Again, the new system of investment grants to manufacturing andextractive industries will substitute Government expenditure for tax reliefs.    Changes of this type, even when they are fiscallyexactly equivalent, result in more or less &quot;public sector expenditure&quot; as defined in paragraph 6 and thus make itnecessary to redefine the total limits accordingly&quot;.If it is possible (as it obviously is) to &quot;redefine the total limits&quot; wheninvestment grants are subsituted for investment allowances, the same kind of redefinition can surely be carried out with regard to the family endowment scheme.5.      Finally, if the Chancellor wishes, it would not be difficult to workout an option scheme to relieve family poverty parallel to the option schemewe have introduced in order to help the needy owner-occupier,    Such ascheme would have the advantage of removing the danger of confusion towhich the Chancellor points in paragraph 3 of his memorandum.    but since this advantage would be more than counter-balanced by itsadministrative difficulties I would hope that my colleagues will abide by their previous decision.J\- , I-A o S o C.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,13th March, 1967
