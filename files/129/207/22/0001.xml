CONFIDENTIAL $ 1/UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 52 COPY NO 8129 October 1979CABINETREVIEW OF VEHICLE EXCISE DUTYMemorandum by the Minister of Transport1. In announcii-g the review of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) I had fourmain points in mind:i. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was bound to be reluctantto surrender such an instrument of indirect taxation.ii. In Opposition the Shadow Cabinet had decided to oppose aswitch from VED to petrol tax and some colleagues had relied onthis pledge during the election campaign.iii. Among the organisations opposed to the change were theConfederation cf British Industry, the National Farmers Unionand the motoring organisations; andiv. if it was decided to retain VED we would nevertheless wantto achieve substantial savings in manpower in the Civil Service.2. It was already clear that we could expect significant reductions inmanpower if we decided to abolish VED.    But the possibility of achievingsimilar benefits while retaining the tax had not been investigated. Thishas now been done.3. Transferring licensing work to the Post Office would offersignificant manpower savings.    It would not require legislation.    We wouldbe using public sector resources more efficiently and the public would havea more convenient service than they have now.    The Post Office wouldneed only about 200 extra staff.    Under this proposal 3, 000 post offices,including 1, 000 sub-offices, would provide licensing facilities - only 2, 000do so now on a limited scale and for all but the mosrt routine transactionsthe public have to go to one of only 81 of my Department1 s local offices.We can count on post offices being able to handle relicensing, but furtherinvestigations are needed to see whether they can also take on the morecomplicated first licensing transactions.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. We could achieve further staff savings by abolishing short-periodlicences.    I would be against complete abolition because of the largenumber of motorists (5^ million) affected but I would support a changefrom four monthly to six monthly licences coupled with a stamp savingsscheme.    This would produce a useful manpower saving and extra revenue.5. Retention of VED would still of course leave the problem ofenforcement.    There are measures that my Department can and will takebut in the long term I am attracted by the idea of tax on possession. Thiswould involve paying tax for having a car rather than, as at present, forusing it.    This would incidentially also produce further staff savings.Further study is needed and is in hand.    It may not be possible to introducethis change before the computers at Swansea are replaced in 1983, but inprinciple I think the change would be desirable.6. If therefore we decide to retain VED and tc adopt the changes I haveindicated above, I would be able to offer savings of 1,150 to 1, 350 staff and 3 million over the next two or three years and possibly a furthear 200 staffand  1 million if we were able to introduce a tax on possession. Thesavings, though substantial, are less than we could get from abolition.But we should be retaining an important source of tax revenue and keepingto a decision we took in opposition on which many of our supporters relied.7. Clearly this is a balanced decision.    Neither course is free ofpolitical disadvantage.    However my view is that VED should be retainedbut at the same time we should seek to achieve the staff savings I haveindicated above.N FMinistry of Transport29 October 19792CONFIDENTIAL
