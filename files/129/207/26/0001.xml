CONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT81C(79) 56 COPY -NO30 Octbber 1979CABINETNATIONALISED INDO&quot;STRIF;S&apos; INVESTMENT AND FINANCINGMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryL On 13 September (CC(79)15th Conclusions, Minute 7) the Cabinetendorsed the general conclusions of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s paperC(79) 37 and asked me to report back the results of bilateral discussion of theoutstanding issues.2. Because of the timetable I am having to report before decisions have,been taken on the Secretary of State for Energy&apos;s proposals for a phasedremoval of under-pricing of electricity and gas, which I strongly support asthe minimum.3. The figures in this paper represent nationalised industries&apos; netborrowing from all sources (including leasing) which constitutes theircontribution to the public expenditure planning total.    They exclude grants(mainly for rail, coal and shipbuilding), which fall into other programmes,and are covered in decisions on those programmes.    For convenience,however, increases in coal grants above the level provided in Cmnd 7439 aredealt with here.    The figures here are not comparable with those for eachindustry&apos;s external financing limit.    On the assumption that the electricityand gas pricing proposals are accepted, the position is as follows:  million at 1979 Survey prices1981-82      1982-83 1983-84Borrowing 693 93 -573Additional coal grants 95 20 -TOTAL (rounded) 800 100 -550Higher (or lower) than proposals inC(79) 37 500 -50 -400The figures allow for a standardised shortfall of  400 million a year. Theydo not allow for the effects of the disposal programme which will be treatedseparately in the White Paper about the later years.    The annex gives detailsof the comparison with C(79) 37 and of the figures for individual industries.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. There is a sharp contrast between the beginning and the end of theperiod.    For 1981-82 the financing figures are about  500 million higher thanproposed in September.    Most of this is due to the energy industries and thePost Office, but the figures for British Aerospace (BAe), which of courserelate to the unlikely contingency of the Corporation remaining in the publicsector, allow for continuation of the BAe 146 project.    For 1982-83 the figuresare  50 million below the levels we aimed at.    On the other hand for 1983-84we have a prospect of making greater savings than I originally proposed.5. If the Secretary of State for Energy1 s proposals were not accepted,sums of the order of  600 million would be at stake by 1983-84.    The resultwould be an even greater problem in 1981-82 and a reduction of the furthersavings in 1983-84.6. I should stress that some of these figures are based on stringent policyassumptions about the attainment of viability by such industries as the CoalBoard, British Steel and British Shipbuilders, as well as sustained progressby the railways in tackling their problems and a steady move to get rid ofunder-pricing particularly of gas and electricity.    Moreover, there must be arisk that the economy will not develop as favourably as some of the industrieshave been assuming, and this could add to their prospective external financingneeds.    In other words, the figures assume success and are to that extentdistinctly optimistic.CONCLUSION7. We shall need to consider whether to adopt these figures for the secondWhite Paper on Public Expenditure in the light of the decision about energypricing.    On the assumption that the Secretary of State for Energy&apos;s proposalsare accepted, I recommend that they should be adopted, subject to tworeservations.    First we shall need to consider nationalised industries&apos;financing in the light of the total public expenditure figures for 1981-82 and lateryears.    Second, we should emphasise in public presentations the provisionalcharacter of these figures, which, because they represent the differencebetween much larger flows of revenue and expenditure, are likely to fluctuatemuch more than the costs of implementing plans for the public services. Theywill need to be rigorously reappraised in next year&apos;s Investment and FinancingReview, in the light of the more cautious assumptions the industries are likelyto make about the prospects for economic growth;  the case for each industry&apos;sinvestment plans will require very careful scrutiny.    Meanwhile - and subjectto this second reservation - sponsor Departments should be permitted toauthorise up to 85 per cent of the investment programme in 1981-82 and 70 percent in 1982-83.J BTreasury Chambers30 October 19792CONFIDENTIAL
