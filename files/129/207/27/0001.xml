CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENTC(79) 57 COPY NO 8119 November 1979CABINETFURTHER ACTION TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THECIVIL SERVICEMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council1, On 1 November (CC(79) 19th Conclusions, Minute 8) I was invited tobring before Cabinet two revised lists, the first to show a complete andcomprehensive account of the savings offered and agreed by departmentalMinisters where decisions had been taken or could be taken without furtherado;  and the second to show those which still required policy decisions;indicating in each case where legislation i s required.    I was asked also tocirculate a text of the announcement to be made at the conclusion of theexerci se.FIRM SAVINGS2. Annex 1 (which is not for public announcement) lists the savingsoffered and agreed by departmental Ministers.    It shows for eachDepartment the total savings in this category, and the principal componentitems.    In each case the total has been accepted by the Minister concernedas a firm commitment.    The Annex specifies all individual savings whichrequire primary legislation, and shows the value of savings requiringsecondary legislation, larger items being shown individually.3. Several colleagues have indicated that, while the total savings shownfor their Departments can be regarded as firm, they cannot at this stagecommit themselves to the precise way in which these savings will be achieved.In other cases they point out that the savings shown for particular items mustbe regarded as approximate at this stage.    In a few instances, the savingsinclude particular options (listed in the Appendix to Annex 1) which would, ifpursued, require further discussion or consultation.    But these are notcrucial to achieving the total savings listed in Annex 1, since the Ministersconcerned have undertaken to find equivalent savings elsewhere if necessary.4. The total savings listed in Annex 1 amount to  212 million (5 per cent).I recommend that we agree to accept these as a firm commitment for eachDepartment.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSAVINGS REQUIRING POLICY DECISIONS5. I regret that these savings are smaller than the earlier estimate of6 per cent ( 250 million) I told my colleagues on 1 November (C(79) 51).The greater part of this reduction is accounted for as follows:a. Options which the Chancellor of the Exchequer says requirebudgetary decisions or collective agreement because they arecontroversial.    Together with some smaller items he regards asuncertain, these amount to about  28 million, and account for aboutthree-quarters of the reduction.b. Thirteen options which the Secretary of State for SocialServices says cannot be regarded as firm and two which he hasdropped.    These amount to about  6 million.c. Several options which the Secretary of State for Employmentsays depend upon controversial primary or secondary legislation.They cannot yst count as firm though some of the legislation will beintroduced before the end of the year.    They amount to about 2.5 million.None of these options is included in Annex 1.    Where appropriate, they areshown in Annex 2.6. Annex 2, which lists the potential savings which still require policydecisions or further consultations, now comprises the five major itemslisted in Annex 4 of C(79) 51 together with the options referred to inparagraph 5 above and other minor options to which similar considerationsapply.    The total potential savings here amount to  111 million or 2. 6 per centOUTCOME OF THE REVIEW7. This is even more disappointing than I reported earlier.    But it iscrucial that we now make an announcement about the outcome of the Review.The House of Commons has been promised an announcement in the autumn.The longer it is put off, the greater will expectations be, and the greaterthe disappointment to our supporters.    Relations with the staff and unionswill come under even greater strain if we delay.8. I understand the feelings of some of my colleagues who think thatfor reasons of staff relations we should now say that this exercise is over.I do not think we can do that.    Unless our supporters believe that there ismore to come, this operation will be considered a failure.    We must findmore and I believe it is possible.    The main burden now must fall on thethree largest Departments.    I have repeatedly told my colleagues that if wewere to have a respectable outcome to this exercise these Departmentswould have to provide their full share.    But the contributions of the2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Departments so far are 4.2 per cent, of theMinistry of Defence 3 per cent and of the Department of Health and SocialSecurity 1.8 per cent.    There are good reasons why they need more time.But it will be essential to press ahead in these three areas and with thereviews which some other Ministers have in train;  and to make clearpublicly that while this is the end of this Service-wide operation, there ismore to come from specific areas of our operations.ANNOUNCEMENT9. A draft of an announcement, and of the framework of the supportingdetail to appear in the Official Report, is attached as Annex 3.    I proposeto make the announcement in the House of Lords on Tuesday, 27 November;my Minister of State will repeat it in the House of Commons on the same day.I propose to hold a press conference immediately afterwards and then to seethe National Staff Side and (for industrial civil servants) the JointConsultative Committee.    Colleagues will no doubt make arrangements toinform their Departmental staff representatives similarly.    I am alreadyin touch with colleagues about general descriptions of the savings forinclusion in the table to be published in the Official Report.CIVIL SERVICE NUMBERS10. Departments have had to reduce their numbers drastically in orderto keep within their adjusted cash limits in 1979-80.    The phasing of thesavings we are now planning means that staff numbers over the Service as awhole may temporarily rise again in 1980-81 after account is taken of thegrowth agreed for that year.    We must expect sharp criticism if this happens,and I therefore ask all my colleagues to ensure personally that the staffnumbers in their 1980-81 Estimates bids are reduced to the essentialminimum.    I cannot stress the importance of this too strongly. Theresults of our manpower review will otherwise not appear credible.RECOMMENDATIONS11. I invite my colleagues to agree that:a. The total savings for each Department listed in Annex 1 shouldbe confirmed, and that I should make the statement at Annex 3 onTuesday, 27 November.b. We should aim to secure the maximum possible savings fromthe policy issues listed in Annex 2 and from further reviews.c. All Ministers should ensure personally that staff numbers intheir 1980-81 Estimates bids are reduced to the essential minimum.SCivil Service Department19 November 19793CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALANNEX 3DRAFT PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENTREDUCTIONS IN THE SIZE OF THE CIVIL SERVICE1. [My Lords, with the leave of the House,  I should like tonake a statement on the future size and cost of the Civil Service.][With permission, Mr Speaker,  I should like to repeat a statementbeing made in another place by my Rt hon and Noble Friend the LordPresident of the Council.]     [My hon Friend the Minister of State inthe Civil Service Department] [I] announced on 11 June that theGovernment intended to make major savings in the size and cost ofthe Civil Service over the next few years and that our decisionswould be announced in the autumn.?. The Government has carried out this review for three mainreasons.     First, we believe that it is in the national interestto reduce the role of Government.      Secondly, at a. time whennublic expenditure as a whole has to be restrained,  it is right thatthere should be a contribution from central Government administration.Thirdly, it is a good thing to examine any large organisation, publicor private, from time to time and prune those activities which maynave been undertaken for good reasons but are now less essential.3. All Ministers have examined the activities of their departmentsto identify the savings which can be made, whether by increasedefficiency or by the abolition or curtailment of functions.      As aresult, we will be making savings right across the Civil Service.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe scope for this varies between departments.     At one end of thescale, there are large savings as high as 17%.     In other departmentsthe scope is much smaller, but even in the fields of law and orde:Hand defence, to which as the House knows the Government attaches highpriority, some savings are being made.4. The exercise we have now carried out will lead to savings inCivil Service staff costs of about  212m, most of which will beachieved by April 1982.     The net effect on public expenditure wibe rather less because some of the savings will come from puttingout to the private sector and this work will have to be paid for.In terms of Civil Service numbers, the savings.we are announcing todayamount to some 40,000.     This is in addition to the steps we havealready taken to reduce expenditure on Civil Service manpower this yea:by the equivalent of some 20,000 posts - 60,000 in all. TheGovernments aim will be as far as possible to secure the reductionsby natural wastage.5. The savings by departments resulting from the present decisionsjwill be shown in general terms in a table in the Official Report, andcopies will be available in the Vote Office.     Details of the savingsare of course the responsibility of the departmental Ministers conperri6. I am announcing today those savings that it has been possibleto identify reasonably quickly, but further reviews are already underway in a number of departments, for example, in the Ministry of DeBDHSS, MAPP and DOE.     Now that the service-wide review of functionsCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhas been completed, these are the next steps.     The House will bekept informed of progress from time to time.     Ministers willcontinue the search for economy and efficiency in their departmentsthroughout the lifetime of this Parliament.     In addition they willbe assisted in particular projects by Sir Derek Rayner.7. I will not try to predict the exact size of the Civil Servicethat will result from these continuing activities. Obviously,circumstances are continuously changing.     But we have reversed themajor expansion which took place under the last Government. Ourpredecessors planned for a Civil Service of no less than 748,000 byApril next year.     The numbers now stand at 712,000.     There arebound to be fluctuations from time to time, but the general trendfrom now on will be downwards.8. The size of the Civil Service must always depend upon the dutiesthe Government of the day asks it to undertake.     This Governmentnow requires from it a narrower range of work.     This is no reflectionwhatsoever on the conscientiousness and ability with which civilservants at all levels have carried out the tasks they have beengiven.     I am glad to pay tribute to these qualities, as I am sure isthe whole House.9. The reductions I have announced today, coupled with the furtherreviews now in progress, will produce a smaller Civil Service andone better adapted to the country&apos;s needs.CONFIDENTIAL
