SECRETIdOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 3220 July 1979CABINETCOPY NO80REFORM OF SECTION 2 OF THEOFFICIAL SECRETS ACT 1911Memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department1, We undertook in The Queen1 s Speech to bring forward a Bill toreform Section 2.    It is common ground between us and the other majorParties that reform should be broadly based on the scheme proposed by theFranks Committee whose report (Cmnd 5104) was published in 1972.2. I attach at Annex 1 a summary of my proposals.    The Franksrecommendations are attached, for convenience, at Annex 2.    I particularlydraw my colleagues&apos; attention to the following points.CABINET PAPERS AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENCY AND THERESERVES3. Franks proposed that there should be protection for all Cabinetpapers and for information about the currency and the reserves thedisclosure of which would be likely to cause serious injury.    When Cabinetpapers contain protected information (eg on defence) they would naturallyreceive protection by virtue of that fact, and I do not propose that we shouldinclude in the Bill provision to protect Cabinet papers as such.    On thecurrency and the reserves I have consulted the Chancellor of theExchequer and we do not propose that the Bill should protect any economicinformation as such.    On both these points my proposals are in line withthose of the previous Administration as set out in the White PaperCmnd 7285,CERTIFICATION OF SERIOUS INJURY TO THE INTERESTS OF THENATION4, This presents some difficulty.    Franks proposed that informationin the defence and international relations categories should be protectedonly if its unauthorised disclosure was likely to cause serious injury to theinterests of the nation, and that the issue of serious injury should not be leftfor the jury to determine.    We can readily accept both points. Theproblem is what authority should determine serious injury.1SECRET
SECRET5. Franks argued that the only authority that could properly do thejob was the responsible Minister, who should personally review the factsand, if satisfied on the point, issue a certificate that would be conclusiveproof of the fact that the information in question met the &apos;serious injury&apos;test.    In Opposition, both last year and in the proceedings this year onMr Freud&apos;s Bill, we took the line that the responsible Minister would beseen as acting as judge and jury in his own cause and that an elementindependent of government (in shorthand, &quot;three wise men&quot;) should beintroduced into the certification procedure.6. In favour of &quot;three wise men&quot; (whether they take the decision or aremerely advisory) it must be said that the arguments we recently used inOpposition will be attractive to many elements in a House of Commons thatwe have yet to assess, and it can be argued that it would be too embarrassingto be seen to change our minds on the issue so soon after entering office.Against the idea, there would be difficulties in finding acceptable peoplewho were both prepared to do the job and whose appointment would notprovoke controversy;  and there could well be awkward problems on, forexample, the right to make representations to the &quot;three wise men&quot; whenmuch of the Government1 s own representations could not be revealed, forreasons of security.     Also, a defendant would not be made defenceless bythe responsible Minister (or anyone else) certifying the fact of likely seriousinjury;  he would under my proposals have available the defence that he hadno reason to believe that the information was of that nature.7. On balance, I recommend that we should revert to the Franksproposal that the certification of information as being likely to causeserious injury to national interests should be the business of theresponsible Minister alone.CONCLUSIONS8. The outline of the legislation I propose is much the same as theprevious Administration&apos;s White Paper.    The essential features of thestructure set out in Annex 1 are as follows (paragraph references are tothe paragraphs of the annex): -i.     Only the disclosure of official information should bepenalised (paragraph 2).ii.     The categories of protected information should be broadlythose recommended by the Franks Committee, though with someadjustment (paragraphs 3-8).iii.     The protection of information should depend on its nature,rather than on the classification of documents (paragraph 10),2SECRET
SECRETiv.     The Bill should nevertheless contain provisions aboutclassification, which is of evidential value in a prosecutionand puts thoae handling classified documents on notice abouttheir nature (paragraph 11).v.     Separate offences (and available defences) should beconstructed for Crown servants, Government contractors andprivate citizens (paragraph 12).I invite my colleagues to agree to the proposals in paragraphs 3 and 7 aboand in Annex 1, and to approve the preparation of a Bill giving effect tothese recommendations.W WHome Office20 July 19793SECRET
ANHEX 1DETAILED PROPOSALS FOR THE REFORM OF SECTION 2 OF THE OFFICIALSECRETS ACT 19111 .     The Franks Report recommended that instead of the catch-allprovision of section 2 - which penalises unauthorised disclosureand reception of any official information - there should be a muchnarrower measure confined to information in certain specifiedcategories.2. It is envisaged that the protection of the criminal lav; shouldbe applied only to official information, which would be defined asinformation held at some point by Crown servants or by Governmentcontractors (and these expressions themselves would be defined inthe Bill).    There would no longer be an offence of receivingofficial information, but a citizen who knowingly disclosedprotected information without authority would commit an offence.Categories of Protected Information(i) Defence and Internal Security3. As envisaged by Franks, it is proposed that there should beprotection for information about defence and internal security,the disclosure of which would be likely to cause serious injuryto the interests of the nation or (and this is a refinement toFranks following the line taken in debate on Mr Freud&apos;s Bill) wouldendanger the safety of a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies.This would include information about such matters as the armed forces:military weapons and their development; defence policy and strategy;and plans and treasures for the maintenance of &apos; essential suppliesand services, Whether in time of war or not, or for the maintenanceor restoration of public order; and information about similar defencematters in allied States.(ii) Interr;ationa 1 Re 1at ions4-.     Again as envisaged by Franks, &quot;it is proposed that there shouldbe protection for information about international relations, thedisclosure of which would cause serious injury to the interests of
deserved blanket protection.    It is proposed that all informationabout -the thr.ee security.and intellieence    gencies, and about Workdone in support of them&apos; (for example in the Ministry of Defence and thArmed Forces) should bo protected.(vi) Interception of communications8. It will be necessary to provide similar blanket cover forthis category of Information.Protective Security Measures9. The previous Administration&apos;s White Paper suggested that itwould be necessary to apply criminal sanctions to protect informationabout protective security measures.    This was not somethingsuggested by Pranks.    It is proposed that the Bill should providea separate offence penalising the unauthorised disclosure of anyofficial information which could be used for the purpose of obtainingaccess to any information protected by the Bill, if the disclosureis made in circumstances in which it would be reasonable to expectthat it might be used without authority for that purpose. Theprovision would thus protect such matters as cyphers, keys, passes,communications equipment and other physical and technical means ofpreserving the security of official information.Provisions about classification10. Pranks couched his recommendations for the protection ofcategories such as defence and international relations (paragraph Jand 4 above) in terms of information which was classified: that is,marked as 1 SECI^ET&apos;  in the sense that its disclosure would causeserious injury to the interests of the nation.    It is proposed toadopt the previous Administrations app?-oach on this, ie that theBill should pre vide protection in terms of the nature of theinformation, rather than whether or not it is classified. Thisshould plug some of the loopholes which arise on the Franks approach
the nation or which would endanger the safety of - a citizen of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies.    International relations would bebroadly defined to cover relations between Governments, internationalorganisations and organisations or people carrying on politicalactivities in other countries.(iii) Law and Order5. It is proposed that there should be protection for informationabout law and order in the sense of:  information which is likelyto be helpful in the commission of offences;  or is likely to behelpful in facilitating an escape from legal custody or other actsprejudicial to prison security;  or information the disclosure ofwhich would be likely to impede the prevention or detection ofoffences or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. Thiscategory is also on lines recommended by Franks.(iv) Confidences of the Citizen6. Franks proposed that there should be protection for informationgiven to the Government by private individuals or concerns, whethergiven by reasons of compulsory powers or otherwise, and whether ornot given on an express or implied basis of confidence.    It isenvisaged - and this has been our policy since 1975 - that the Billshould go beyond this and provide protection for information heldby the Government.    In detail, what we propose is that the categoryshould comprise information received by a Crow servant or Governmentcontractor - whether from the subject of the information, or not -on terms or in circumstances requiring it to be held in confidenceor in circumstances in which it would be reasonable to expect itto be held in confidence.    As Franks proposed, protection would belimited to information about private citizens and private concerns.(v) ^scjjrity and Intelligence7. Franks dealt with this as part of the defence category, subjectto the &quot;serious injury&quot; test.    The last Administration recognisedthat special considerations applied here, and that the category- 2 -
over, for example, documents which ought to have been marked asclassified but which are not, whether by accident or design. Butalthough information will be protected by the law whether or notit is classified it is clear that classification serves a usefulevidential purpose.    A Crown servant, for&apos; example, who discloseda properly marked document would find it hard to persuade a courtthat he had no reason to believe that the information in thedocument was protected.11. It is therefore proposed that the Bill should include provisionsabout classification.    It should lay down the criterion forclassification (ie that unauthorised disclosure would be likely tocause serious injury to the interests of the nation.) and provide,as Pranks envisaged, for regulations to be made about &apos;the classi-fication and declassificatiou of documents, which should includeprovisions on levels of authority at which decisions on classificationmay be taken arid on arrangements for review and declassificatior &apos; .Offences12. Franks envisaged that there would be three main offences:disclosure by a Grown servant contrary to official duty; disclosureby a Government contractor when the disclosure was not made for thepurposes of the contract or was made coatrary to some restrictionimposed on behalf of the Crown; and disclosure by a private citizenof information which he knew or had reasonable ground to believereached him as a result of a contravention of the Act.    It isenvisaged that there should be offences on broadly these lines,though the private citizen offence would not be dependant on thecitizen&apos;s knowledge or belief that the information reached him asa result of a contravention of the Act.    Instead there would be anoffence of unauthorised disclosure by a private citizen in circum-stances when he appreciated, that the information in question wasprotected by the Act.    The Bill would provide that in the case cf- 4 -
 tux &apos;^*Bp!he citizen the prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonableoubt that the accused knew or had reasonable cause to believe thathe information was protected; whereas the Crown servant orovernment contractor would have a defence if he could prove thate did not have that knowledge or cause for belief.3.   It is also proposed that the Bill would create, as Franksnvisaged, a separate summary offence of failure by a Crown servant0 take reasonable care of an official document protected by the Act,t is envisaged that the Bill should provide for such an offence -0 apply to Crown servants, Government contractors or citizens - andtiat the offence should be in terms of failing to take such care to&quot;event the unauthorised disclosure of the document as a person inis position may reasonably be expected to take.The Bill would provide that in the case of an alleged offenceivolving information in the  &quot;law and order&apos;  or &quot;confidences of theitizen&apos; categories (paragraphs 5 and 6 above) the accused would^ve a defence Lf he could prove that at the time of the allegedfence the information had been made available, or had become a&apos;railabl1 request, to rjhe public or a section cf the public *?osecution, Penalties etc5-   Franks proposed that, with one exception, prosecutions shouldmounted only with the consent of the Attorney General. The-ception concerned disclosure of information in the &apos; law and order.1ntegory when prosecution would require the consent of the Directort&quot; Public Prosecutions.    These proposals, and the more technicalcommendations concerning powers of arrest, penalties and juris--^-ction, have riot produced controversy and it is envisaged that a11 might follow the lines Franks proposed.own, servantsIt is proposed that the Bill should define Crown servants aseluding Ministers of the Crown, civil servants, members of the
armed, forces, and members of the police force.    It is alsoenvisaged that there should be a provision enabling the Secretaryof State to designate further individuals or bodies whose officialswould be Crown servants.    The main purpose of designating certainpersons as Crown servants is not to render them liable to criminalsanctions - since it is envisaged that a citizen who knowinglydiscloses official information will also be liable - so much asto define,.indirectly, what is official information: that is&quot;jiiat has beeninformation/held by a Crown servant or Government contractor byvirtue of his position as such.- 6 -
ANNEX 2FRANKS REPORTSPECIFIC PROPOSALSThe replacement of section 21. Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 should be repealed, and replacedby narrower aDd more specific provisions.(Chapter 7, ie paragraphs 38-100.)2. The new provisions which we recommend, in place of section 2. shouldform a separate statute, to be known as the Official Information Act.(Paragraphs 101 -3.)Information to which the Official information Act should apply: defence, foreignrelations, currency.3. Defence and internal security. The Official Information Act should applyto official information relating to matters which concern or affect the defenceoi security of the realm, including in particular those matters set out in thesubparagraphs below. Information relating to.the defence or security of alliedPowers, covering matters of the kind mentioned in subparagraphs a. to f. (butnot g.) should be included in this category: (a) the Armed Forces of the Crown and matters relating thereto;(b) military weapons, stores and equipment cf all kinds, including nuclearweapons, ships, aircraft, vehicles, communications systems and allmeans of warfare;(c) (lie research, development and production of all item; covered by b.;(d) defence policy and strategy and other military planning, includingplans and measures for the maintenance of essential supplies and servicesjn i]&apos;^ event cf war *(e) intelligence and security services, and information obtained by them;(f) military treaties and arrangements with other Powers, and negotiation:;of such treaties and arrangements;(g) internal defence and security, and plans and measures relating thereto,including plans and measures for the maintenance and restoration ofpublic order or of essential supplies and services in contingencies short ofwar.(Paragraphs 122-5.)4. foreign relations. The Official Information Act should apply to officialinformation relating to any matters which concern or affect foreign relations crthe conduct of foreign relations.

Currency and the reserves. The Official Information Act should applyto official information relating to any proposals, negotiations or decisionsconnected with alterations in the value of sterling, or relating to the reserves,including their extent or any movement in or threat to them.(Paragraph.. 135-9.)Provisions on classification6. The Official Information Act should apply to official information withine the three categories described in proposals 3, 4 and 5 above if it has beenclassified, in accordance with the provisions of proposal 7 below; on the groundthat its unauthorised disclosure would cause at least serious injury to theinterests of the nation. The prosecution should Have, to satisfy the court that theinformation fell within a category, and that it was so classified, but the courtshould not be concerned with the effect of.the disclosure on the interests of thenation.
7. The Ofiicial Information Act should contain the following further pro-visions on classification: (a) Information should count as &quot;classified&quot; within the meaning of theAct if-(i) in the case of a document, it is marked with the word SECRETor words including the word SECRET, or it relates to militaryweapons or equipment (as defined in proposal 3 b. and c.) andit is marked DEFENCE-CONFIDENTIAL, and in either caseit has been classified in accordance with the provisions of the Actand of regulations on classification made under it;(ii) in the case of a communication by non-documentary means,the information relates to the contents of a document which isclassified in accordance with (i), or is information which, if it hadbeen contained in a document, ought to have been so classified.(b) The Secretary of State should make regulations about the classificationand declassification of documents, which should include provisionson levels of authority at which decisions on classification may be takenand on arrangements for review and declassification.(c) The unauthorised removal of a classification mark, or the making of acopy of a classified document without the mark, should not affect theclassified status of that document.(Paragraphs 150-7.)8. Before a decision is taken whether to institute a prosecution for the dis-closure of classified information within one of the three categories, there shouldbe a review of the classification of the information which had allegedly beendisclosed without authority. This review should be carried out by the responsibleMinister himself. He should be required to consider whether, at the lime of thealleged disclosure, that information was properly classified SECRET or aboveor DEFENCE-CONFIDENTIAL, in the sense that its unauthorised dis-closure would cause serious injury to the interests of the nation. If he was notsatisfied on this point, then no prosecution would -ic possible. If he was satisfied,he should give a certificate to that effect to the court. This certificate should beconclusive evidence of the fact that the information v.as classified within themeaning of the Act. All other ingredients of the offence should be proved byevidence in the usual way.(Paragraphs 158-161.)9. The Government, and the representatives of the news media and of anyother interests directly affected, should enter into discussions with a view to theestablishment of an informal Committee on class;fication of the kind outlinedin paragraphs 165-6 of the Report.(Paragraphs 163-6.)Other information to which the Official Information Act should apply10. Maintenance of law and order.
