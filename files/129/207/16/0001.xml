CONFIDENTIALOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BP ITANNIC MAJESTY &quot;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 4622 October 1979COPY NO gCABINETWHITE PAPER ON PUBLIC EXPENDITURE IN 1980-81Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. At Cabinet on 13 September (CC(79) 15th Conclusions, Minute 5)we agreed to publish an early White Paper on our decisions in 1980-81.Attached is a draft to which I seek colleagues&quot; agreement.2. I propose to publish it on 31 October and to follow the usual practicewith annual public expenditure White Papers by making no oral statement tothe House on the date of publication, but waiting for the usual debate. If,however, colleagues judge that the announcement must be made by oralstatement, 31 October would not be suitable because both the Prime Ministerand the Chancellor of the Exchequer will be abroad:  Thursday 1 Novemberwould then be a better date.3. The public expenditure totals in the draft reflect the decisions wehave taken on both 1979-80 and 1980-81, apart from two changes which Ishould mention.4. First, there has been an increase in the figures for nationalisedindustries&quot; borrowing in 1980-81, following discussions in the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy.    As a consequence, the 1980-81 totalnow shows a small increase over the present estimate for 1979-80 (line 13of Table 1 of the draft), and that despite a reduction in the estimate forshortfall in 1979-80, which raises the total for that year.    Decisions yetto be made, on the progress towards economic pricing in the gas andelectricity industries, may require further adjustments here.5. Second, there has been an increase of  10 million in the figure forHer Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office to bring it into line with the provision in1978-79.6. When we publish the subsequent White Paper covering the later yearsof the Survey period, we will need to take account of the economic forecaststo be published under the Industry Act and of further decisions on staffsavings.CONCLUSIONS&apos;*        I invite my colleagues to approve the draft attached, and to decideon the date of publication.Treasury Chambers W J B22 October 1979CONFIDENTIAL

THE GOVERNMENTS EXPENDITURE PLANS 1980-811. Public expenditure is at the heart of Britain&apos;s present economicdifficulties.2. For a long time now the performance of the British economy hasbeen deteriorating. Over the past five years output has grown less than halfas fast as it did over the previous 20 years, and little over a third as fast asin other industrialised countries. Without the contribution of North Sea oilthere would have been scarcely any growth in output or productivity at all.Inflation has been at record levels, and has acquired strong momentum.3. Over the years public spending has been increased on assumptionsabout economic growth which have not been achieved. The inevitable resulthas been a growing burden of taxes and borrowing. Increases in taxes have made inflationary pressures worse andreduced incentives. High Government borrowing has fuelled inflation by making propercontrol of the money supply more difficult, and has denied the wealth-creating sectors some of the external finance they need for expansion. High inflation has increased the risks and uncertainty faced by bothemployer and employee and gravely damaged investment, productionand jobs.If this continued, our economy would be threatened with endemic inflationand economic decline.4. In deciding their spending plans for 1980-81 the Government havehad in mind three central objectives: First, to bring down the rate of inflation. To achieve this it is essentialto contain and reduce progressively the growth of the money supply.This means that Government borrowing must in turn be firmlycontrolled. It is a main determinant of monetary growth. Second, to restore incentives. This means that the Government musthold down and if possible reduce taxes, particularly on incomes. Third, to plan for spending which is not only compatible with thenecessary objectives for taxation and borrowing, but is also based ona realistic assessment of the prospects for economic growth.5. The immediate prospects for output are poor both in this countryand in the rest of the world. The growth of world trade is low andlikely to remain so for some time. The recent increase in the oil price hasmade matters worse.6. The Government^ economic strategy must be to stabilise publicspending for the time being. Unless this is done there can be no possibilityof lower taxes, lower borrowing or lower interest rates.7. For 1980-81 the previous Government^ plans involved a level ofexpenditure which could not be sustained. Even leaving out of accountthe likely cost of &quot; catching-up&quot; pay settlements in the public services,their published plans were  4 billion higher than the spending now plannedfor 1979-800).   To pay for this increase would have required sharply0) At 1979 survey prices.311957 A2
higher taxes or borrowing on a scale which, if possible at all, would meanhigher interest rates or an excessive growth of the money supply and moreinflation. Any of these would damage our growth prospects stillfurther and, in so doing, the prospects for higher spending on our publicservices in future.8. To limit severely the resources devoted to our public services forthe time being is not to deny that many of them need improvement. Itis rather to recognise the way in which the improvement can be secured.The only way is to earn the money and resources required first, byhigher output. Higher output can only come from better working of ourmarket economy, lower taxes, lower interest rates and less Governmentborrowing.   To plan more public expenditure before the required output isPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1978-79 TO 1980-81Table 1   million at 1979 survey prices		1978-79 Provisional outturn	1979-80 Plans	1980-81 Plans1.

available to support it would ensure that in the event that growth of outputdoes not take place. Higher public expenditure cannot any longer beallowed to precede, and thus prevent, growth in the private sector.9. Total expenditure now planned for 1980-81 is shown in Table 1.The Government have provided for growth in some programmes, particularlydefence, law and order, and social security (reflecting among other thingsthis year&apos;s record pensions uprating). Within the total, reductions havetherefore been made in other services. The plans for later years will bepublished in a later White Paper.10. The figures in Table 1 for 1979-80 include the public expenditurereductions announced in the Budget. The outturn is still uncertain,particularly on local authority expenditure which the Government do notdirectly control. The present estimate is that the planning total of publicexpenditure after shortfall will be about the same as in 1978-79.11. Figures for the main programmes are set out in Table 2. Briefcomments on the individual programmes follow in paragraphs 16-42.Where appropriate, the Ministers concerned will be announcing furtherdetails.TOTAL PUBLIC EXPENDITURE BY PROGRAMMETable 2   million at 1979 survey prices	1978-79 Provisional outturn	1979-80 Plans	1980-81 PlansDefence ...............	7,509	7,824	8,062Overseas aid and other overseas services...	1,961	2,135	2,191Agriculture, fisheries, food and forestry ...	896	986	993Industry, energy, trade and employment	3,267	2,753	2,870Government lending to nationalised in-dustries...............	693	1,800	1,000Roads and transport .........	2,980	3,118	2,914Housing......... ......	5,226	5,380	5,078Other environmental services ......	3,330	3,303	3,213Law, order and protective services	2,370	2,454	2,542Education and science, arts and libraries	9,567	9,657	9,246Health and personal social services	9,055	9,109	9,194Social security ............	18,213	19,058	19,289Other public services .........	973	1,010	997Common services............	1,048	1,073	1,088Northern Ireland......... ...	2,232	2,215	2,150Total programmes (see Table 1, line 4)	69,320	71,875	70,8295
Local authorities12. The broad breakdown of local authority current expenditure betweenservices, incorporated in Table 2, is consistent with the pattern of individualprogrammes discussed in paragraphs 16 to 42, which reflect the Governmenfsview of national priorities between and within services in 1980-81. However,the figures are necessarily tentative since it is for individual local authoritiesto decide the eventual distribution in the light of local needs and conditions.The breakdown which has been assumed is set out in Table 3 below. Theplanned levels for capital expenditure in 1980-81 are some 8 per cent lowerthan in 1978-79, or 9 per cent less than the outturn at present estimatedfor the current year.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE BY LOCAL AUTHORITIESIN GREAT BRITAIN (a)Table 3   million at 1979 survey prices	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	Provisional	Plans	Plans	outturn		Current expenditure			Education, libraries and arts ......	7,664	7,754	7,396Local environmental services ...	1,902	1,899	1,823Law, order and protective services	1,764	1,817	1,858Personal social services.........	1,263	1,292	1,204Transport ............	1,182	1,149	1,110Housing......... ......	539	617	647Other programmes .........	226	239	238Total (current) ............	14,540	14,767	14,276Capital expenditure			Education, libraries and arts ......	418	384	350Local environmental services......	640	620	615Law, order and protective services	68	58	66Personal social services.........	64	75	72Transport.............	567	613	549Housing...............	1,822	1,865	1,623Other programmes .........	4	7	9Total (capital) ............	3,584	3,623	3,284Total (capital -f- current).........	18,123	18,389	17,561(a) The totals differ from those in line 2 of table 1, which cover the UK.13. The outturn of local authority current expenditure in 1979-80 cannotyet be estimated. The figures for current expenditure in 1979-80 thereforestill reflect the levels of expenditure planned at the time of the Rate SupportGrant settlement in November 1978. But local authorities have been askedto achieve economies which would result in a lower outturn for 1979-80.6
Special sales of assets14. As announced in the Budget speech, the Government is intending toraise some  1 billion from sale of assets owned by the public sector in thecurrent year, as a contribution to reducing the public sector borrowingrequirement. Measures for raising this sum are in hand. The target forthe corresponding reduction in the public sector borowing requirement in1980-81 is  i billion.Civil service staff costs15. The civil service staff costs included in the 1980-81 programmetake account of the revised manpower levels flowing from the adjustment tothe current year&apos;s cash limits and the changes in public expenditure pro-grammes both in 1979-80 and 1980-81. They do not, however, allow foradditional savings resulting from the review of the size of the cost of thecivil service announced by the Minister of State, Civil Service Department,on 11 June; these will be announced in due course.The individual programmesUnless otherwise stated, all expenditure figures in the following paragraphsare at constant, 1979 survey prices.Defence16. The provision for the Defence Programme reflects the Governmenfsdetermination to give priority to strengthening the nation&apos;s defences, withinthe framework of the NATO Alliance, and at the same time to achievemaximum value for money within the resources available.Overseas aid and other overseas services17. Overseas aid will be at about the same level in 1980-81 as in thecurrent year. Similarly, the provision for other overseas services is plannedto continue at much the present level (except that the current year includescontingent provision for UN peace-keeping operations, and once-for-all grantsof military aid to two Commonwealth countries). In order to tailor activitiesto this level of expenditure, 23 overseas posts will be closed or reduced insize and other FCO services curtailed.18. The provision for net contributions to the European Communities andto the European Investment Bank rises from about  920 million in 1979-80to about  1000 million in 1980-81, representing the full estimated net cost tothe United Kingdom under present arrangements; it demonstrates the strengthof the Governmenfs case in pressing our Community partners to acceptwithout delay a fundamental change in these arrangements.Agriculture, fisheries, food and forestry19. The provision made for expenditure on EEC-financed marketsupport policies allows for an increase of  84 million compared with 1979-80.In the rest of the programme there is a net reduction of  77 million as aresult of sales of land and changes in various services and their uptake,7
partly offset by provision for some increase in expenditure on fisheries.(The forecasts for expenditure for 1979-80, however, on which these com-parisons are based, include payments due in 1978-79 but delayed byindustrial action; if allowance is made for these the  77 million reductionbecomes  40 million. Similar delays affected some other programmes, butnot to the same extent.)Industry, energy, trade and employment20. Expenditure by the Department of Industry in 1980-81 on industrialsupport will be slightly below the level now planned for 1979-80. Thepolicy changes announced by the Government on regional and selectiveassistance, and on the National Enterprise Board, affect both of these yearsbut the full savings will be achieved after 1980-81.21. Selective assistance by the Department of Energy to certain industriesunder Section 8 of the Industry Act 1972 and assistance to the nationalisedindustries, mainly coal, will continue to be provided. This programme alsoprovides for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority&apos;s research anddevelopment work in the nuclear field and for the Department of Energy&apos;sexpenditure on energy conservation, research and development activities.22. ECGD expenditure is expected to increase by  156 million whichreflects the once-for-all reduction achieved in 1979-80 by the Trustee SavingsBanks taking over some  200 million of outstanding refinance.23. The abolition of the Price Commission, which is expected to save 3 million in 1979-80, should produce a full year&apos;s saving of  7 million in1980-81.24. The provision for 1980-81 for measures operated by the ManpowerServices Commission is held at the reduced level for 1979-80. No provisionis made for the extension of the Small Firms Employment Subsidy, the JobRelease Scheme, or the Temporary Short-Time Working Scheme which aredue to close for applications in March 1980. The statutory short-timeworking scheme proposed by the previous Government has been dropped.Nationalised industries25. The public expenditure planning total includes the industries&apos; borrow-ing from all sources (line 9 of table 1 as well as Government lending intable 2). The level planned for 1980-81 represents a reduction of  350 millionon the expected figure for the current year. No allowance is made inthese figures for the Governments plans for special sales of assets, theproceeds of which are included separately in line 10 of table 1 (see paragraph14 above).Roads and transport26. The roads and transport programme will be reduced by some  200million compared with 1979-80 and the reductions will be spread widelyacross the programme. It is the Governments intention that about half thetotal reduction should come from local transport expenditure, both capitaland current. There will be a reduction in central government expen-diture on the motorway and trunk roads programme from the level previously8
planned, but the level will remain slightly above the reduced volume ofexpenditure now planned for 1979-80 and there will be a switch within thisprogramme to permit increased expenditure on motorway maintenance.Roughly half of the overall change will result from a reduction in centralgovernment subsidies to transport industries, the bulk of which will reflectchanges in the arrangements for the funding of British Rail and NationalFreight Corporation pension schemes. There will also be small reductionsin new bus grants, ports investment and transport research.Housing27. Public expenditure on housing is expected to increase between1978-79 and 1979-80 by about  150 million. It will then fall in 1980-81by about  300 million to about  5,080 million. Capital expenditure will bebroadly unchanged between 1978-79 and 1979-80 but will fall in 1980-81by some  240 million. The reduction compared with 1978-79 reflects theexpected decline in local authority new housebuilding which will result froma change in local authorities&apos; priorities.28. Current expenditure, chiefly subsidies to public sector housing, isexpected to be  80 million higher in 1979-80 than 1978-79, partly becauseinterest rates have risen. A further increase of about  30 million is expectedin 1980-81, although local authorities are expected to make higher rentincreases than in recent years. Over a period of years the Governmentintend to reduce further the level of housing subsidies, which at presentcosts taxpayers and ratepayers  1-5 billion nearly a third of all publicexpenditure on housing. This will be assisted by the new subsidy systemfor England and Wales, which will start in 1981-82 and relate subsidiesmore directly to need.Other environmental services29. The amount included for 1980-81 for this miscellaneous group ofservices, mainly provided by local authorities, takes account of savingsarising from the Government^ decision to abolish the Community LandScheme. Legislation will be introduced to enable local authorities to reducetheir net expenditure on local environmental services by charging forplanning applications and for the enforcement of building regulations.Capital investment on water and sewerage services is planned to continueat broadly the same level as in 1979-80. Expenditure on the UrbanProgramme will be at a higher level than is now expected in 1979-80.Capital expenditure on local environmental services is less than theprospective outturn for 1979-80. Expenditure on the Thames Barrier willincrease by  28 million with a view to completing the project in 1982.Law, order and protective services30. Planned expenditure on this programme will increase to reflectthe Government^ decision to give priority to law and order. Total provisionin 1980-81 will thus be  2,542 million,  23 million higher than the provisionfor that year in Cmnd 7439 and  88 million higher than expectedexpenditure in 1979-80. This does not however include any net expenditurewhich may arise from the recommendations of the inquiry into the United9
Kingdom prison services or from the Royal Commission on Legal Services.Included in the total is provision for additional central government expen-diture on court services and other legal services, including legal aid, and onprisons. In England and Wales expenditure on the police will be increasedto allow an increase in strength to 115,500 officers by March 1981 withincreases in supporting staff and services both locally and centrally. If thisestimate for numbers of police officers is exceeded, further provision will bemade from the contingency reserve. The planned expenditure will alsoenable local authorities to increase their provision for the probation andafter-care service and magistrates&apos; courts; and, in the fire service, will enableexisting standards of fire cover to be maintained. In Scotland, additionsfor these services will be made commensurate with the totals in Englandand Wales.Education and science, arts and librariesEducation and science31. The Government are committed to promoting higher standards ofachievement. The number of pupils in schools will be falling but accounthas been taken, both in teaching and in non-teaching expenditure, of theinescapable diseconomies of smaller scale. The figures in the programmeprovide for the employment of some 505,000 teachers in 1980-81 (comparedwith about 526,000 in 1978-79), sufficient for the present level of inductionand in-service training to be maintained. It will be necessary to step upthe rate at which surplus school places are taken out of use. It should bepossible to maintain expenditure on the under-fives at about the presentlevel.32. The Government expect expenditure savings of some  240 millionto be made on school meals, milk and transport. Parliament will be askedto give local authorities greater discretion in the nature of and charges forthese services.33. Some modest expansion of non-advanced further education,especially vocational courses, should be possible to meet rising numbersaged 16 to 18. The resources available for home students in highereducation will be about the same as in 1979-80. New overseas students ortheir sponsors will be expected in future to meet the full cost of theirtuition.34. There will be no reduction in the provision for capital expenditureon school basic need but building programmes for school improvements,under-fives and further and higher education will be reduced by abouthalf.35. Provision for science at just over  300 million will be slightly lessthan in 1979-80.Arts and libraries36. Direct central government expenditure in support of museums,libraries and the live arts in 1980-81 should allow a continuation ofactivities at a level broadly comparable to what has been possible in thecurrent year.   Planned expenditure includes the contribution of the Office10
of Arts and Libraries to the  15-5 million to be provided for the newNational Heritage Fund and for acceptances of works of art in lieu of tax.Local authority expenditure on libraries, museums and art galleries will fallto the extent that local authorities&apos; provision for these services reflects thereductions in planned local authority expenditure in general.Health and personal social services37. The Government plans to maintain spending on the NationalHealth Service in 1980-81 at the level proposed by the last Administration.However, the net cost to the taxpayer will be reduced by increased recoveryunder the Road Traffic Act 1972 of the cost of treating the victims of roadaccidents, by increasing prescription charges to 70p from April 1980, byrevising dental charges so as to maintain their 1979-80 level in real terms,and by limited changes in the welfare milk scheme. Gross expenditure willbe about 3 per cent above the 1978-79 outturn. Measures which are beingtaken to eliminate waste and to simplify administration in the National HealthService will enable the available resources to be channelled more into directpatient care.38. Spending on the local authority personal social services is likely tobe reduced. The Government expect that savings will as far as possible bemade by further increases in efficiency, by reducing or eliminating low priorityprovision, by developing policies designed to help people to help themselvesand others, and by promoting collaboration with the voluntary sector. Wherereductions in standards of provision prove necessary, authorities will be reliedupon to implement these in ways which protect the most vulnerable.Authorities have also been asked to give priority as far as possible to thoseservices for children which are concerned with the prevention and treatmentof delinquency.  Joint finance will continue at the level planned.Social security39. Expenditure on social security reflects the numbers who qualify forand claim the benefits, which are in turn influenced by the course of theeconomy and demographic variations. For the purpose of the calculation, itwas taken as a broad working assumption that the unemployed (excludingschool-leavers) would average 135 million for 1979-80 and 1 - 65 millionfor 1980-81. The figures reflect the Governments intention to intensifyefforts against fraud and abuse of the social security system.Other public services40. The principal expenditure in this programme is on revenue collectionby Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, and is mainly related to staff.In 1979-80 the programme included  26 million for the cost of theParliamentary and European elections. For 1980-81 there are small increasesfor financial administration and population surveys (preparation for 1981census).Common services41. The provision for civil service superannuation, which is  28 millionhigher than for 1979-80, assumes some increase in the number of pensionsin payment and their average level.   Expenditure by the Property Services11
Agency on the Government office estate in the UK will be reduced by cutsin expenditure on major new works (mainly on new offices following thedecision to reduce the dispersal of Government work from south-eastEngland) and also by reductions in minor works, furniture, rent, maintenanceand running costs.Northern Ireland42. The Northern Ireland total for 1980-81 reflects, among other changes,the consequences of decisions taken on public expenditure in 1979-80,including the application to Northern Ireland of measures such as theincrease in health charges. Expenditure on law and order in NorthernIreland will rise to ensure that the necessary resources are available tocombat terrorism.12
EXPLANATORY AND TECHNICAL NOTESExplanatory and technical notes were included as Part 6 in the publicexpenditure White Paper published in January 1979 (Cmnd. 7439). Thefollowing notes supplement that description.The definition of public expenditure in this White Paper2. In general, the same definitions are used in this White Paper as inCmnd. 7439. The two principal changes are:(a) Family benefits. The change from child tax allowances and familyallowances (including child interim benefit payable during 1976-77) tochild benefit was spread over a period of years. During the tran-sitional period the total for the social security programme includedonly the net Exchequer cost of the change; this treatment was reflectedalso in public expenditure totals. The gross cost of child benefit wasshown in the main table for the social security programme togetherwith tax revenue flowing from reductions in child tax allowances.Now that the transition to child benefit has been completed by thegeneral withdrawal of child tax allowances, the social security pro-gramme and public expenditure totals include the gross cost of childbenefit (up to 1976-77 family allowances including child interimbenefit).(b) Net overseas and market borrowing of nationalised industries. Thedefinition has been broadened to include short-term borrowing andthe capital value of leased assets. Net short-term borrowing is definedto include the industries&apos; transactions in other public sector debt.The definition of the industries&apos; external financing requirement usedin the public expenditure planning total (including borrowing andgrants) is thus now aligned with that used for their cash limits.Main classification changes since Cmnd. 74393. The following are the principal transfers between main programmesthat have been made to reflect new arrangements:(a) Expenditure on computer requirements supplied to central governmentdepartments by the Central Computer Agency and formerly includedin the common services programme has been distributed to theappropriate functional programmes, reflecting the change to provisionagainst repayment by the user department from 1 April 1980. Theother programmes principally affected are defence; trade, industry,energy and employment; roads and transport; housing; other environ-mental services; law, order and protective services; health and personalsocial services; and other public services.(b) Some further expenditure on the urban programme has been re-allocated from other environmental services to housing, roads andtransport, education, and health and personal social services.13
(c) To improve functional control it has been decided to confine theprogramme for Northern Ireland to expenditure within the responsi-bility of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Thus expenditureby the Ministry of Agriculture in that area is now classified toagriculture, fisheries, food and forestry; and expenditure on the courtservice to law, order and protective services.The price basis of this White Paper4. Except where otherwise stated, money figures in this White Paperare presented at constant prices (described as 1979 survey prices) to allowcomparisons from one year to another of the quantity (&apos; volume&apos;) of goodsand services used, either directly or indirectly, by the programmes. For mostexpenditure on goods and services 1979 survey prices are used as they werein the autumn of 1978 (for most local authority current expenditure the dateis, more precisely, November 1978). For most transfer payments, 1979survey prices are assumed average prices of 1979-80.5. The average increase from 1978 survey prices (the price basis ofCmnd. 7439) to 1979 survey prices is 11^ per cent. The price basis fori borrowing by nationalised industries has been changed from estimated pricesfor the financial year in which the White Paper is published for the precedingfinancial year (1978-79 for this White Paper).Debt interest6. Total public sector interest payments, corresponding to the estimatesin table 1, line 6, on the &quot; public expenditure &quot; definition of debt interest,are as follows:  million at 1979 survey prices1978-79	1979-80	1980-819,900	9,900	9,800Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office311957 Dd 0626903  K38 10/79
