SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 31 COPY NO     g j)17 July 1979CABINETREPORT OF MINISTERIAL GROUP ON PUBLIC EXPENDITURENote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. The Cabinet on 12 July invited a group of Ministers (the LordPresident, the Secretary of State for Trade and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, with myself in the chair) to discuss the proposals on publicexpenditure reductions in 1980-81 in the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s paperC(79) 26 with the spending Ministers concerned, and to report back to Cabinetfor the meeting on 19 July.2. Our report is attached.G HTreasury Chambers17 July 1979SECRET
SECRETCABINETMINISTERIAL GROUP ON PUBLIC EXPENDITUREREPORT1. When on 12 July Cabinet discussed the Chief Secretary^ proposals inC(79)26 concerning public expenditure in 198O-81, they asked this group (theChancellor^the Exchequer, the Lord President, the Chief Secretary, the TradeSecretary) to discuss the proposals with the Ministers responsible for themain spending programmes.2. This we have done.   Annex A lists the Ministers v&amp;h whom we haveheldmeetings.   This paper represents our report.3. In our discussions several of the Ministers concerned proposed or acceptedreductions in their programmes beyond those offered earlier.   Column 1 of Annex Bshows the figures for cuts suggested in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper, column 2 theoffers now made by the Ministers concerned.k*    We have identified certain cases where we think larger cuts would be appropriatethan have so far been agreed. These additional cuts are included in column 3t whichwe recommend as a minimum for cuts to be agreed now.   The last column of thepaper shows any differences between these and the original proposals by theChief Secretary in column 1.   The total would still be some      billion less cutsthan the economic projections suggest as necessary.5*    We set out below for each Department the main issues for decision, and ourproposals for resolving these.   First, however, we draw attention to two generalissues which emerged from our discussions:(a)   Local Authorities6.    A number of Ministers drew attention to the difficulty of implementingreductions on local authority current expenditure which, given the exemptions,comprise a large proportion of the proposed total.   Without specific statutorypowers to compel local authorities to implement cuts in expenditure they canonly be influenced indirectly, through the RSG settlement, housing subsidyarrangements and various forms of guidance.   These instruments do not oblige them1
SECRETto comply with our plans for reductions in programmes, both because they canreallocate these among different programmes under their control, and because theycan avoid the cuts by increasing their rates.7. In this situation, it seems to us that the immediate announcement of thereductions in local authority current spending, as agreed by Cabinet, would bebest stated as a single global total and percentage reduction, without giving anyGovernment view on the proportionate cuts in individual programmes. Theannouncement would still of course need to include the agreed legislative changes;it would make clear that the &quot;law and order&quot; local government services were exempt;and it would say in general terms that the central government was prepared toback the local authorities in making these cuts, even at the cost of some reductionin the standards of services, and would be taking them into account in fixing thelevel of RSQ later in the year.8. There are some problems about this:(i) Although individual Ministers could point to the legislative steps theywere taking, it would preclude any individual announcements of the percentagecuts agreed in Cabinet for their services, and this might lead to falseassumptions that they had accepted the uniform percentage cut in the caseof each service.(ii) The process of consultation about later years, which is envisagedfor the autumn, would be made more complicated.(iii) In any case totals for individual services over the whole runof years would need to be given in the public expenditure White Paper,which would indicate what had been assumed as the components of theoverall reduction fr next year, and might lead to questions on whythese more specific indications had not been given initially.9. IJevertheless, to give a single total for the reductions would avoid showingusefullyin precise terms the scale of the cuts in particular services, and would^reflectthe actual freedom of local authorities.   If practicable this total shouldinclude the cut in housing subsidies, discussed further in the &quot;Environment&apos;section, below.   Accordingly, we recommend that Cabinet should agree to give a2
SECRETsingle figure in the announcement of these reductions.   It will be necessaryto consider whether means can be found to prevent or discourage local authoritiesfrom avoiding these intended cuts by raising their rates.(b)   Additional 3$ Reductions10. The reason why the further 3$ reduction on most programmes is needed wasexplained in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper (paragraph 1*0.   Not surprisingly,a number of Ministers have told us of their difficulties in finding this furtherunallocated 3$ cut, beyond the specified options put forward to meet the target foreach programme agreed earlier by Cabinet.   We accept that the proposed 3$ hasto be looked at in the context of each programme individually.   Several of ourcolleagues have been able to accept some or all of this additional cut in tiieirprogrammes.   In a few other cases our recommendations below propose total reduct-ions beyond the specified options, requiring some or all of this 3$.   But in severalprogrammes we have had to accept that the additional 3$ is particularly difficult.DEFENCE11. The defence budget represents 11$ of total programmes in 1979-80. Ouracceptance of the NATO target of average increases in the region of 3$ in volumeterms in the defence budget on the NATO definition (which is only marginally,and for this purpose unimportantly, different from ours) is one reason why cutsin other programmes have to be so large in order to produce the necessary reductionin public expenditure as a whole.12. The Defence Secretary has now proposed, subject to the condition discussedbelow, that the defence programme for 1980-81 should be  13 million higher thanthe provision in the last Government&apos;s White Paper Cmnd. 7^39, so that we canbe shown as proposing to spend more than our predecessors.13. The Chief Secretary&apos;s proposal is to use the NATO target as a criterion, byadding 3% to the revised volume of the defence budget in 1979-80, after takingaccount of the economy drive launched by the Defence Secretary and the exceptionaltreatment already given to defence in accordance with the Manifesto, viz:&apos; -      an extra  100 million for equipmentadjustment of the cash limit to accommodate theaccelerated armed forces pay increase in full, with
SECRETno phasing and no 3$ cuta further addition recently authorised to compensatefor the VAT and oil duty increases which in all otherprogrammes are to be contained within the cash limitspreviously fixed.1*U   The Defence Secretary has reduced his bid for additional expenditure overthe inherited plan from  88 million to  13 million, but is concerned aboutcriticism if the budget is set below his current bid.   He has also proposed thecondition that the cash limits for 1980-81 should eventually be set in such away as not to impose any additional volume squeeze.15-   As a result of the exceptional action mentioned above, and the expectedshortfall in 1978-79, the defence budget for the current year 1979-80 alreadypermits a k.6% increase on 1978-79.   The Defence Secretary&apos;s proposal wouldrepresent another k.7% on top of a growth path far above the NATO target.On the lower figure suggested by the Chief Secretary there would still be anincrease of more than 6% over the two years even if shortfall in 1980-81 were1^.16.   We recommend that the defence budget should be fixed in the way proposed bythe Chief Secretary, that is, by applying 3$ to the revised defence budget inthe current year.   This represents a cut of  115 million from the baseline forthe present exercise.   The point about cash limits should be noted, but thiswill have to depend on our general policy concerning cash limits which iscurrently under discussion separately.
SECRETAID AND &quot;OTHER&quot; FCO EXPENDITURE17. The Chief Secretary asked for net reductions of  132 million -from theAid Programme and  28 million from &quot;other&quot; FCO expenditure.18. The Foreign Secretary has offered reductions of  107 million and  13 millionrespectively.   He has commented as follows:(a) Savings on overseas representation can be made only by reducingstaff and closing overseas posts.   Savings of 13$ have already beenachieved in this fashion over the last 10 years.   He has offered 2-J million, which would involve cutting 120 jobs in the FCO andclosing a substantial number of consular posts abroad.   He considersthat any further reduction now would involve wholly unacceptabledamage to our external interests.   He has also agreed to savings onaccommodation overseas, provided by the PSA, to the extent of  3 million.(b) It is essential to maintain the BBCs world service in English,and to secure its audibility, and also to maintain the vernacularservices to iron curtain countries.   But he has agreed to savings of&amp;k million by dispensing with some other vernacular services.(c) He has also agreed to a saving of  3 million on British Councilexpenditure, but is unwilling to agree to more unless it were on the basisof a full-scale policy review of the British Council&apos;s activities.(d) He can accept a saving of  j million on expenditure on internationalorganisations but believes that to do more would be seriously damagingto our external interests.(e) The aid programme contributes to securing exports and to promotingspecific foreign policy objectives;   he is unwilling to accept areduction by more than  107 million, which would leave the aid programmein 1980-81 at the same level as in 1979-80.We recommend:(i) That the savings offered by the Foreign Secretary on &quot;other&quot;FCO expenditure should be accepted, subject to the proviso that a5
SECRETfull-scale interdepartmental review should be mounted of theactivities of the British Council which are funded by the FCO,with a view to securing further net savings by functionalchanges.(ii)   That the Foreign Secretary should make some further savings inthe aid programme, beyond  107 million;    each 1% is worth about 8 million.AGRICULTURE (including Scottish and Welsh Programmes)19-   Net reductions were sought of  ^3 million.   The Minister of Agriculturewas prepared to accept the items proposed in C(79)26 other than the  20 millionrelated to capital grants, but reserved the right to pursue some part of hisadditional bid for arterial drainage.   The grant arrangements were under urgentreview, but he did not wish to endanger investment and the UK&apos;s competitiveposition.   He would however be prepared to offer an additional  11.5 millionof land disposals.20. We believe that there is scope for saving in the grant regime, and thatthese would have the additional merit of certainty and permanence.   We recommendthat the review of capital grants be conducted on the basis that the  20 millionsavings required will be secured and will be announced as soon as possible,although we would not rule out some recourse to land disposals in 198O-81, tomake up the total reductions sought.FORESTRY21. The proposed reduction of  5 million was accepted, but it was suggestedthat further consideration should be given to the scope for increased disposalof surplus land on the basis that the Forestry Commission might be given theincentive of a share of the proceeds.   We do not rule out such an examination,but the bulk of any savings will be needed in the disposals exercise, and forpresent purposes we recommend that the reduction of  5 million should stand.6
SECRETINDUSTRY22. The original objective was a reduction of  157 million.   This will beachieved, largely as a result of changes in regional aid which we have alreadyagreed.   The Secretary of State has now agreed to save a further  30 million -the full 3% cut which the Chief Secretary invited him to make.   Part may comefrom the NEB&apos;s provision for investment in the microelectronics company Inmos,but the bulk will be found by arranging for the private sector to take on certainIndustry Act loans at present financed by the Department.   The total savings of 187 million will be nearly 16$ of the Industry programme published in Cmnd 7^39.TRADE23. The net reduction sought was  20 million, of which the extra 3% reductionrepresented  5 million.   The Secretary of State has an additional requirementfor  6 million in respect of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which it hadpreviously been hoped to cover in full by savings elsewhere, although there area very limited number of possible sources in this programme.   We accept thatthe CAA bid is unavoidable.   Allowing for additional offsetting savings amountingto  3 million, we recommend acceptance of a slightly smaller net reduction of 17 million.ENERGY24. The Secretary of State for Energy has not agreed to  17 million of the 2^ million cuts proposed;   the Chief Secretary also proposed that additionalbids of  ^1 million should be dropped.   At issue is expenditure on nuclear andnon-nuclear R&amp;D and the Departments (small) share of total expenditure onenergy conservation.   We recommend that the cuts should not be pressed, and thatno provision for the Secretary of State&apos;s additional bids for 198O-81 should bemade at this stage.TRANSPORT25. The Minister of Transport is willing to make cuts amounting to  231 million*or 8.8$ of his programme (the total of specific cuts proposed in Annex B to7*The cut of &amp;k million on DVLC has been excluded to avoid double counting withthe Lord Presidenfs savings on the Civil Service.
SECRETC(79)26 excluding the further 3%).   He points out that such cuts would have asevere effect on new road construction both by the Government and by localauthorities, would involve substantial increases in bus and train fares and wouldreduce the total programme well below the levels both of 1977-78 and of1973-74.   The Minister does not therefore regard it as feasible to make the furtherreduction of  70 million or 3^ proposed in 0(79)26.   He has however offered tocontribute about  20 million towards that reduction, mainly by a further cut inthe trunk road programme.2b.  Accordingly we recommend a total reduction of  250 million on roads andtransport.HOME OFFICE27. The Chief Secretary proposed reductions amounting to  12 million and additionslimited to  22 million (mainly on manpower for the police, prison and probationservices).   The Home Secretary agreed to make reductions of  12 million, but hewill substitute a saving of  1 million on the Race Relations Commission for halfthe saving on the Equal Opportunities Commission.   He also proposed a furtheraddition of  15 million (on top of the  22 million) for the police support services,for prison industries etc. and for the building programmes for magistrates&apos;courts, the probation service and the police.28. The Committee asked the Home Secretary to reconsider his proposals on thebuilding programmes and prisons, and to estimate the cost of the Government&apos;sdecision to admit additional refugees from Vietnam.   After re-consideration hereduced his additional bid to  12 million, and he estimated the cost of Vietnameserefugees at  2 million.29. Accordingly we recommend that the net addition to the Home Office programmeshould be raised from  10 million to  2^ million, which would include provisionfor Vietnamese refugees.ENVIRONMENT30. The Chief Secretary asked for a total reduction of  1,603 million. TheSecretary of State for the Environment has offered a net  887 million, leaving 716 million to find.8
SECRET31..  The Committee noted the Secretary of State&apos;s view that:(a) He did not consider himself committed to the reductions agreedin Opposition on the housing programme, which, at 19$, exceeded thereductions called for in nearly all other programmes.(b) There would be grave practical&apos; and political objections tosecuring subsidy savings in 1980-81 by means of rent increases aboveearnings, given that the necessary legislation might not receiveRoyal Assent in time and that rent increases could not be guaranteedunless local authorities&apos; discretion over rent levels were reduced.(c) Offsetting increases totalling  200 million in the housingprogramme were necessary for additional council house improvementand local authority mortgage lending.For the rest, the Secretary of State&apos;s view was that the additional &apos;3$ savings&apos;on housing ( 120 million) and DOE (other) ( 75 million) were impracticable, butthat the full savings on PSA were practicable given the abandonment of dispersal.32.  There are three main issues for the Cabinet to decide on the housing programme:(a) Level of cuts agreed in OppositionDo colleagues agree that the minimum level of housing reductions in1980-81 should be that broadly endorsed by the Treasury andEnvironment teams in Opposition ( 1,1 Mt million)?(b) Rents above earningsDo colleagues agree that this will require subsidy savings achievedby increasing council house rents faster than increases in earnings?If so, urgent consideration will be needed on how legislation canbring this into effect for.198O-81, and whether action is necessaryto prevent local authorities avoiding these rent increases by raisingtheir rates.(c) Additional bidsDo colleagues agree to reject the additional bid for  200 millionon local authority mortgage lending and council house improvement,9
SECRETgiven that there is no specific Manifesto commitment in theseareas?33-   An intermediate position, over the whole range of DOE programmes, wouldbe to drop the additional J)% for housing and &apos;other&apos; ( 195 million out ofthe  1,264 million total).   But on balance we recommend that the full savingsproposed for these programmes (including the additional J&amp;) should be made,and that:(a) Net housing subsidy savings of  150 million should be securedthrough rent increases.   The Secretary of State should be invitedto discuss urgently with the Chief Secretary the legislative andpractical implications.(b) The additional housing bids should be set aside.(c) The further savings required should be sought first by scrutinyof the provisions for new housebuilding, given the currently lowlevel of approvals and starts;   improvement of municipalised property,given the cut-back in municipalisation;   and improvement grants, whenspendinglast year&apos;s actual          was over  80 million below the baselineprovision.EDUCATION AND SCIENCE34.  The Chief Secretary in C(79)26 proposed reductions amounting to  860 million.The Secretary of State for Education and Science has offered cuts of  517 milBon(6%).   In addition to what he proposed in his paper (C(79)29), this would besecured mainly by removing the obligation on local authorities to provide schoolmeals for secondary pupils, and school milk.   He has pointed out that cuts ofthis size would involve:(a) Contentious legislation - as well as the relaxation on schoolmeals and milk, local authorities would be enabled to impose chargesfor nursery education and for school transport.(b) No improvement, though also no worsening, in the standards ofprovision in school, further education and higher education.10
SECRET1(c)   The removal of any minimum maintenance grant to students (now 335 a year) and the imposition of a charge of up to  700 a yeartowards tuition costs, which would thus increase the contrdfcutimby amounts ranging from &amp;?0 for parents with incomes below  13,000,up to  1,000 for those with incomes above  25,000.reover the reduction in the services for the under-fives, for school transportand for school meals would all put additional burdens on mothers and limitpheir opportunities to take part-time work.p5*  We nevertheless recommend that the total reduction on the education andfscience programme should be at least  517 million.   We have asked the Secretaryof State to consider whether further savings might be found by increasing feesfor overseas students who are already here instead of only for those who starttheir courses in September 1980.   About  420 million of the savings offered bythe Secretary of State would be included in the overall reduction in localauthority current spending (paragraphs 5-8 above), and we recommend that thiscontribution should be increased to  450 million, bringing the total reduction onthis programme to  547 million.OFFICE OF ARTS AND LIBRARIES3d. The reductions sought in 0(79)26 total  33 million.   The Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster has represented to us the damage which big cuts in the artsand libraries programme would do, and has reminded us of the statements made inOpposition that we would not impose &quot;candle-ends&quot; economies in this area. He ishowever prepared that his local authority expenditure should bear the samepercentage cut as the average borne by local authority expenditure generally,which would provide about  17 million, and we also understand him to have offeredto postpone the new British Library building ( a course already advocated by asubstantial body of cultural opinion) at a saving of about  6 million. Thesesavings, however, are still only about half the total originally sought, andleave the Arts Council and national museums and galleries expenditure untouched.-zn    .. of tne Duchy?(* We note what the Chancellor/said about our pre-Election stance, but we donot consider that this programme need be protected to this extent.   While we. of the Duchy&apos;saccept the Chancellor/ proposal that his local authority determined expenditureshould be cut by the same overall percentage as all local authority expenditure11
SECRET(estimated at 7%%), we recommend also that the remainder of his programme shouldtake a percentage cut of 7.%% overall, to be allocated as the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster decides.   We estimate that this would give a total saving of 28 million.SOCIAL SECURITY38.  The reductions sought by the Chief Secretary totalled  253 million. TheSecretary of State for Social Services has represented to us that these must beviewed against the major savings, in excess of  500 million, which on presentassumptions are expected to result in 1981-82 from breaking the earnings linkfor pensions and making employers responsible for the first six weeks of sick pay.He proposed therefore that certain of the 198O-81 reductions sought amountingearnings related supplement,to  116 million \      women&apos;s pension age, maternity and death grants, maintenancebenefit preferences) should not be proceeded with, on the grounds that they wouldbe exceedingly contentious and might be impossible to get through the House.On the other hand he offered three further areas for savings, amounting to 105- 120 million (depending on how early next summer the necessary legislation,already planned, can be secured).39-  In our view the items which the Secretary of State wants to drop would indeedbe very contentious, and we are content that they should be dropped.   We accepttwo of the three further proposals, worth  75- 90 million (deferment of the 1980uprating by one week, and extending waiting days from three to six for sicknessbenefit).  30 minion of savings from additionalattack on fraud etc., involves the difficulty that it  would require a further600 civil servants, and would have repercussions which wouldbring it into conflict with the policy of containing Civil Service manpower. Thisleaves a total of  212- 227 million, or  26- 4l million short of 0(79)26. Wewould recommend acceptance of the higher figure ( 227 million);   but if delaysin the   legislation meant that this could not be delivered in full we think theSecretary of State should be pressed to find the missing  15 million by someother means, and that he should be asked to consider now howhe would do this ifneed be.40. The offer of  30 million savings at the cost of 600 extrawe have not been able to resolve.   But we recommendstaff raises broader issues,which/that the Secretary of State should neverthelessfind  227 million of savings for 198O-81.12
SECRETFTISH OFFICEThe bulk of Scottish Office expenditure is operated as a block for PESCrposes.   The size of the block is adjusted in an agreed proportion (10:85) toMe aggregate adjustment to comparable English programmes.   On this basis,the Scottish equivalent reduction to the reduction offered by spending Ministersfor England would be  197 million.   The reduction equivalent to our recommendationswould be  285 million.42.  The Secretary of State, while agreeing in principle to accept the reductionsproduced by the operation of the 10:85 formula, pointed out that in practice hecould not undertake to secure reductions in excess of the original proposals inC(79)11.   The difficulty arose largely because h0% of his programme block waslocal authority current expenditure;   many of these authorities would be unwillingto make the full cuts.   Also savings on housing depend on assumptions about rentsunlikely to be realised.*15.  The Secretary of State undertook to secure net savings of  25 million in trade,etc.,industry/ which is outwith the Scottish block on the understanding that anyunforeseen new demand for selective financial assistance could be the subject of-a claim on the Contingency Reserve.84.  There is no separate issue for decision on the Scottish block. Theprecise amount of the Scottish reduction, apart from the agreed  25 million for trade.etc., 1industry/ will depend, on the basis of the formula, on the size of the totalreductions decided for the comparable English programmes.ueLSH OFFICE5-  The Chief Secretary asked for a total reduction of  130 million. Theecretary of State for Wales has offered  110 million, representing the Welshhare of relevant programmes.   But he has said that he cannot find the  20 millionrhich represents the further general 3% reduction.The Committee noted Mr Edwards1 view that:(a)   Given ;he general industrial situation in Wales and the&apos;  decisions already taken on regional policy (which would affect
SECRETWales disproportionately) the total reduction proposed by theChief Secretary would create very serious difficulties.(b) He should not be expected to find any additional expenditureresulting from the closure of Shotton, since he considered thatsteel closures should be dealt with on a .GB basis.(c) There was a case for treating Welsh housing more generously thanEnglish, as shown by the document recently circulated by the ChiefSecretary which compared public expenditure and   rela tive needs inEngland, Scotland and Wales.4b.   The issue for decision is whether the Secretary of State for Wales shouldmake the further      reduction ( 20 million).47. There is also the question of the treatment of any additional expenditureresulting from steel closures.   The Committee sympathised with the view of theSecretary of State that some special treatment was needed because it relates toa general GB problem.48. We recognise that it will be difficult for the Secretary of State for Walesto make the full reduction proposed by the Chief Secretary.   But this is equallytrue of other programmes;   we do not consider that this is a case for giving Waleswholly exceptional treatment.   We therefore recommend that the full reduction of 130 million proposed by the Chief Secretary should be made, subject to a reliefof  2 million in respect of the cost of remedial measures at Shotton.NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES49. The Chief Secretary recommended option cuts in nationalised industry borrowing(including a bid for extra coal grants) worth  720 million in gross terms, yieldinga net reduction of a little over  350 million compared with Cmnd 7^39- Optionsworth  565 million - all except those mentioned below - have been agreed. Theoutstanding issues and our recommendations are as follows:(a) CoalThe&apos; Secretary of State for Energy has agreed to seek savings, but says14
SECRETthe proposed  55 million is not feasible.   We consider that  50 millioncompared with the industry&apos;s financing figure of  623 million shouldshould be possible for an industry with a turnover of over  3,000 millionand total investment of over  600 million.   We therefore recommend thatcredit should be taken for it.(b) Scottish ElectricityThe Secretary of State for Scotland argues that a saving of  10 millionis not feasible without either delaying investment at Torness nuclearstation or a higher price increase than in England and Wales. Werecommend that a saving of  5 million (under 1$ of turnover) should bemade.(c) British AerospaceCancelling the 146 project would save  40 million a year throughoutthe Survey period.   The Secretary of State for Industry favours cancellationand hopes to be able to confirm this later in the week after a meeting withBAe.   We recommend that the saving should be scored now and that if theproject were after all to go ahead, the Secretary of State should seekequivalent savings elsewhere.(d) The Post 0fficeThe Post Office has just revealed a worsening by some hundreds ofmillions of pounds in its estimates for 1980-81 (partly resulting fromaccounting changes).   This must be cured before the option cut of 50 million can be settled. But we consider that this should be possibleeither by investment reductions taking account of slower economicgrowth or by price increases, and on this basis recommend that the cutof  50 million should be scored.   The Secretary of State for Industryexpects to report on this at Cabinet.50. These recommendations would mean that savings of  340 million compared withCmnd. 7439 would be obtained.MINOR PROGRAMMES51. &quot;Minor&quot; programmes, made up wholly or mainly of staff costs, have not beencovered in this exercise, but will of course be expected to make a contribution15
SECRETto the Lord President&apos;s search for staff savings.CONCLUSION52.   In summary, we recommend the reductions in programmes set out in column 3of Annex B, and amounting to  4,011 million; and the proposals for the nationalise:industries in paragraph 49.   Reductions in local authority current spending wouldbe announced as a single figure estimated at  780 million, representing apercentage cut of 6% on average from the previous (White Paper) plans for1980-81.   The precise figure will depend on decisions still to be taken on thedistribution of cuts within programmes, and will need to be converted to thedefinition of current expenditure normally used in the RSG context.53*   Cabinet will note that, despite the difficulties in achieving even this total,it is still  799 million lower than the Chief Secretary&apos;s target of  4,810.million.We shall need to discuss in Cabinet whether any means can be found of furtherreducing this gap.
