CONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT81C(79) 50 COPY NO26 October 1979CABINETVEHICLE EXCISE DUTYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. The previous AoUninistration announced their intention to phase outVehicle Excise Duty (VED) on petrol-driven vehicles and to replace it byincreased petrol taxation. We decided to review this decision and aninterdepartmental Report by officials is circulated with this memorandum.The Report gives the arguments for and against abolishing VED and offersa series of options. This paper describes the main issues as I see them.In my view the arguments point to keeping the tax.2. Officials have identified two major points in favour of abolition:a. staff savingsb. energy conservation.3. I recognise that abolition would provide a significant contributionto the Lord President&apos;s staff saving exercise.    If we were to abolish VEDthe total staff savings would be 2, 400 to 2, 600 over the next three years,with the possibility of further savings in the longer term.    On the otherhand, the review undertaken by the Minister of Transport has identifiedchanges in the operation and administration of the tax that could producestaff savings of 1,100 to 1, 600 with possible further savings in the long term.This means that if we decide to retain VED we are still in a position toannounce substantial staff savings in this area.4. The energy policy argument is that the abolition of VED and itsreplacement by an additional 19p petrol taxation would relate the tax burden&quot;lore closely to actual use, and thus act as an incentive to fuel economy.But this argument assumes that a significant rise in petrol taxation is possibleonly if the overall tax burden on motoring remains substantially unchanged.This is not the case.    In my judgment, abolition of VED would provide nomore than a short term justification for increasing petrol taxes. Indeedthis year I was able to secure a lOp addition to petrol taxation without1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALreference to VED, at a time when petrol prices were rising for otherreasons.    I accept that there are good revenue and energy policy reasonsfor aiming to increase the petrol duty, as and when we can, but our abilityto do this certainly does not depend on making a compensatory reduction inVED.5. As I see it, the choice we have to make is between the larger staffsavings from abolition and the effects on the revenue of the loss of this taxinstrument     I expect VED on petrol-driven vehicles to yield  875 millionin 1979-80.    The tax has not been revalorised since 1977.    If next springI were to increase it by no more than the inflation rate since April 1979,this would provide another  170 million;  and revalorisation on an April 1978basis would yield an increase in revenue of  280 million.    (This contractswith a maximum administrative saving of  15 million from abolition of VED.)I see no problem in securing increases in VED.    The track record of VEDin recent years, uiitil the question of abolition arose, was good, with thetax rates broadly keeping pace with the retail price index.6. Against this, I doubt whether I would be able to secure a flow ofrevenue from petrol taxation alone comparable to the flow if both VED andpetrol duty were available to me.    I have every intention of keeping petroltaxation at as high a level as economic circumstances permit. Butpetrol is an insecure tax base.    Oil prices &quot;\re uncertain, and, as I see it,we are to some extent in competition with the Organisation of PetroleumExporting Countries (OPEC).    There may be times when it would not besensible for wider policy reasons to add further to the petrol price.Moreover, we cannot rule out the possibility of supply disruptions whichcould severely erode - if only for a time - tax receipts from this source.7. With abolition, to avoid a loss of revenue in future, I would needto increase petrol taxation by sufficient to cover not only the current yieldfrom VED but also its revaloriaation in future years.    In addition I wouldneed to provide for the revalorisation of petrol duty itself.    In moneyterms, therefore, the annual increases in petrol duty could be large and,in practice, may not always be acceptable.    We are committed over theyears ahead to secure substantial reductions ii the income tax.    This willnot be easy given the scale of public expenditure I shall have to finance.I cannot look to Value Added Tax to provide additional revenue.    It would,therefore, in my judgment not be prudent to limit the scope for income taxreductions by doing away with a well-established and secure source ofrevenue.8*        To sum up, I recommend that we should -a. Agree to an announcement that it is our intention to retainVED on petrol-driven vehicles; this would be best made, in myview, in the next Budget statement.2CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALREVIEW OF THE OPERATION OF VEHICLE EXCISS DUTYReport by the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Taxation and TransportSUMMARYThis report considers the issues arising from the review of VED announced by theMinister of Transport on 25 May.2. Following the introduction, the report is in four sections.SECTION I - BACKGROUNDJ. The previous administration had decided that VED on petrol-driven vehiclesshould, be abolished and the equivalent revenue obtained by a switch to a highertax on petrol.   Consultations on the phasing of the change were suspended pendingthe outcome of the review.   (Para. 1)^. The major benefits seen from abolition were that administrative costs would becut, evasion eliminated, motorists taxed more fairly, and energy saved withoutincreasing the costs of the majority of motorists.    (Para, h)5-  The main issues raised in the consultations about timing were the effects onthe taxation of diesels, on the vehicle registration system, and on the costs ofrural and business motorists.   The first of these will need to be consideredfurther if abolition is to proceed.    (Paras. 5-6)The increase in petrol taxation needed to replace VED revenue is still put at19p a gallon.   As petrol prices have risen sharply since November 1978 at 19p tax&quot;icrease would now add proportionately much less to the retail price of petrol.(paras. 7-8)&apos;*  The short-term saving in petrol consumption - put at up to 5 per cent in 1978&quot; is now estimated at 3 to j  per cent.   But the saving might be double that inthe long-term.    (Para. 9)* The impact on the motor industry is no longer a significant factor.    (Para. 10).../CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL..2,,SECTION II - THE MAIN ISSUES9. The arguments for VED abolition remain much as they were when the previousGovernment made its decision.   The major argument against is fiscal.   The impcr-tance the Government attaches to income tax reductions and cutting the size of thepublic sector means that Ministers will wish to pay particular attention to thefiscal arguments and the administrative savings.    (Para. 11)10. The switch from VED to petrol duty will do away entirely with the problem ofVED evasion, at present estimated to be running at 7-9 per cent.    (Para. 12)11. A form of taxation which varies in direct proportion to the use made of avehicle is regarded by many as fairer than the present flat rate VED.    (Para. 13)12. The saving of 3-3J per cent of total petrol consumption - and perhaps doublethat in the long term - is particularly desirable now in the light of commitmentsgiven at the Tokyo Summit.   The present price of petrol is in real terms onlyabout 85 per cent of its 1975 peak.    (Paras. 13-14)Fiscal Considerations13. VED on petrol-driven vehicles is estimated to yield  875 million in 1979/80,petrol duty  2,025 million and VAT on petrol  475 million.    (Paras. 16-1?)tt.  To compensate for the loss of VED petrol taxation would have to increase by19p at 1979 prices.   The switch would be broadly neutral in its effects on theSPI.   (Para. 18)15.  The long-term effects on the revenue are uncertain.   The loss of an indirecttax instrument and additional weight put on petrol duty would reduce theChancellors already restricted freedom of manoeuvre and would limit the scopefor cuts in income tax.   Retention of VED could be combined with a policy ofincreasing petrol duty as economic circumstances permit.    (Paras. 19-22) ^Administrative and Staff SavingsThe Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre employs 4,650 people and its localoffices 2,250. If VED on petrol-driven vehicles is abolished, staff will still beneeded to issue driver licences, maintain the vehicle register and handle VED onother vehicles. (Para. 23)
CONFIDENTIAL* * * J a17.  Transfer of work to post offices saving between 800 and 1,^50 staff is apossibility whether or not VED on petrol-driven vehicles is retained.   The precisenumber of staff saved would depend on what other changes are made.    (Para. 2^)3.  Abolition of VED would save 1,600 staff.   With the transfer of most or ailregistration work to post offices the total saving would be 2,^00-2,600. Thefinancial saving would be  15 million p.a.   A  2 fee to cover the cost of regis-tration would yield  28 million p.a.    (Para. 25)19.   In the longer-term it might be possible to save a further 1,100 staff ifinsurance companies were prepared to take on. part of the work of registration.(Para. 26)20 Retention of VED could produce a total saving of between 1,100 and 1,600 staff.In addition to transferring work to the post office, this could be achieved byabolishing four-monthly licences or replacing them by six-monthlies, by abolishingrefunds or by changing the basis of VED to a tax on the possession (rather than theuse) of a vehicle.   (Paras. 27-3*0 !Riming:    The basic changes would need to be implemented before replacement ofthe raain computers in 1983*   a tax on possession or an insurance-linked registrationscheme might take longer.   (Paras. 55-37)Disabled motorists at present exempt from VED would lose this benefit if VED&quot;ere abolished.   Compensation could cost up to  8 million.   The cost of runningPublic service vehicles would also be increased.    (Paras. 38-39)SECTION III - OTHER POSSIBLE VED REFORMS&apos;3.  Two other possible changes are considered.    (Para. kO)^&apos; A. simpler rate structure:    A radical reduction of the 250 VED rates covering&apos; light goods and farm vehicles would make the system easier for the public to^erstand.   Some motorists would fare worse and legislation could be controversial.(Para. Vl).A graduated VED system might be thought fairer (ie. more on Rolls-Royces thanHiais) and might enable more revenue to be raised.   But a tax based on cubicopacity (the most easily practicable base) would yield only small energy savingsand is strongly opposed by the motor industry as an artificial constraint or.esign.   The Group does not recommend it.    (Para. k2.)
SECTION IV -CONFIDENTIALCONCLUSIONS AND POINTS FOR DECISIONS26. The main arguments are summarised. An early decision is needed in viewthe Lord Presidents present exercise.    (Paras. 4j5-^5)27. Ministers axe invited:To decide whether VED on petrol-driven vehicles should be abolishedor retained.If VED is to be abolished:(i)   to authorise the early resumption of the suspendedconsultations;(ii)   to decide whether discussions should be opened on thepossibility of an insurance-linked registration system.(c)   If VED is to be retained: ?(i)   to consider whether staff savings should be sought and, ifso, what they should be;(ii)   to consider whether the possibility of graduated rates ofduty for cars should be pursued further.
CONFIDENTIALREVIEW OF THE OPERATION OF VEHICLE EXCISE DUTY.5-The Minister of Transport announced on 25 May that he intendedto review the operation of vehicle excise duty.   The backgroundto the review was the decision of the previous Administration,announced last November, to phase out the duty on petrol-drivenvehicles by 1983 and replace it by increased petrol taxation.Consultations over the timing of the changeover and relatedissues were still in progress at the time of the election: theywere suspended by the new Government pending the outcome of thereview.2. The purpose of this report is to put before Ministers theissues relevant to the decisions to be taken on the future ofVED.   It has been prepared by the interdepartmental Group onTaxation and Transport under Treasury chairmanship; and officialsof the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the CentralPolicy Review Staff, Customs and Excise, the Civil ServiceDepartment, the Departments of Energy, Industry and Transport,and the Home and Welsh Offices have participated in itspreparation.3. The report is in four main parts.    The first examines thebackground, including developments since the announcement by theprevious administration of its intention to abolish the duty onpetrol-driven vehicles.   The second considers the main issues thatbear on a decision on the future of the duty: and examines indetail the fiscal considerations, and the administrative andother savings and costs that could flow from a decision toabolish or retain it.   The third deals with two possible changesthat might be made in the structure of VED if it were retained:a simplification of the rate structure and the introduction ofdifferential rates of the duty for cars.    The final sectionsummarises the case for and against abolition, and lists thePoints on which decisions will need to be taken../
CONFIDENTIAL.6.I. BACKGROUND4.   The background to the previous Administration^ decision wasset out in paper 8The Future of Vehicle Excise Duty&apos; issued bythe Department of Transport in November 1978.   The main benefitsstat ed in the paper for the decision to abolish VED on petrol-driven vehicles and replace the revenue by an increase in petroltaxation were that administrative costs would be cut, evasioneliminated, the motoring taxes put on to a fairer basis, andenergy saved without increasing the costs of the majority ofmotorists.   The intention was to phase the change over a period,subject to the completion of the process by 1983 when replacementof the main computers at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centreneeds to be undertaken.Views of Interested Parties5- The views of the main interested parties are summarised inAnnex 1.   As might be expected, the majority of the represen-tations received following the announcement of the decision werefrom those opposed to the change but a number were in favour,particularly those from bodies concerned with energy conservationIn the subsequent consultations on the timing of the changeoverparticular concern was expressed about the effects of abolitionof VED on petrol-driven vehicles on:(a) the effectiveness of vehicle registration system;(b) the future taxation of diesel-powered vehicles.Most bodies were reluctant to commit themselves on timing untilProposals on (a) and (b) had been formulated.   Complaints werealso received from petrol users who do not pay VED (eg. usersof aviation spirit).   These and a number of other issues whichhave arisen in connection with abolition are discussed in Annex 2.6- The main concern expressed in Parliament and in letters fromindividuals was about the effects on rural and business motorists.A note on motoring costs is at Annex 3.
CONFIDENTIAL7Recent Developments7. The previous Government&apos;s information paper estimated thatto compensate for the loss of the revenue obtained from VED in1978/79 petrol taxation would have needed to be increased by19p at 1978 prices.   The increase required at 1979 prices toreplace the 1979/80 VED revenue remains at I9p, mainly becausethe  50 rate of VED has not been increased.   Petrol prices have,however, risen sharply in money terms this year as a result ofthe increase in crude oil prices and the tax changes in the June1979 Budget.   The average price is currently about I20p a galloncompared with about 80p in November 1978.   A 19p increase inpetrol taxation is therefore now a significantly smaller proportionof the retail price than it was in 1978.8. This has two consequences so far as the implications of aswitch from VED to petrol taxation is concerned.   The first isthat the energy savings to be gained from the switch are now-reduced.   The second is that a 19? increase in petrol taxationshould now have less effect on the market for UK manufacturedcars than was assumed in past discussions^i9-   On the first point, the information paper estimated that a 19pincrease in petrol taxation at 1978 prices would have reduced thedemand for petrol in the short-term by about 5 per cent. Assumingthat 19p were to be added to present petrol prices, the short-termsavings are now put at between 3 and 3% per cent.   However, thesavings should be larger - perhaps double - in the longer-term asmotorists invest     in more fuel-economical vehicles.10&apos;   In the past, one of the major arguments against VED abolitionWas assumed to be the effect on the motor industry.   The concernWas that a large increase in petrol taxation would encourage rapidfading down to smaller and more fuel-efficient vehicles where the^ industry has traditionally been at its weakest and least profit-able.   However, in view of the recent rise in the price of petrol,aQd the industry&apos;s commitment to meet better fuel economy targets,lt seems unlikely now that a 19p increase in petrol prices wouldhave any appreciable effect on the volume or pattern of car demand.The car manufacturers would however expect to be consulted againa^out the timing of a change.
CONFIDENTIAL8.H.   THE MAIN ISSUES11 i   Apart from the administrative savings, the main reasonsadvanced in the previous Government1s information paper for aswitch from VED to petrol taxation were that it would end evasion,put the motoring taxes on a fairer basis and encourage fueleconomy.    These points are considered in paragraphs 12-15 below.The importance that the Government attaches to income taxreductions and to cutting the size of the public sector means,however, that Ministers will wish to devote particular attentionto the fiscal policy implications and the scope for administrativeand staff savings (both in the Department of Transport and thepossible impact on other public spending programmes). Accordinglythese issues are examined in greater detail in the followingsection of this report.Evasion12. It is estimated that evasion of VED on cars is running atabout 7-9 per cent.   Evasion erodes the revenue and annoys themajority of motorists who pay their duty and resent subsidisingthe dishonest minority.    It is virtually impossible to evadepetrol tax and abolition would therefore solve this problem withconsequential savings to police and courts.    If VED is retainedand enforcement staff increased (by about 150) it is hoped thatevasion can be reduced from its present estimated level to about5-8 per cent.fairness13. VED is a fixed cost paid annually (or in three instalments)and bears no relationship to the amount the car is used. Petroltax, on the other hand, varies in direct proportion to mileagecovered.    It could therefore be regarded as a fairer method oftaxation.SavingsUnlike VED, which is a fixed lump sum, petrol taxatio
CONFIDENTIAL9varies in direct proportion to the mileage covered and the fuelconsumption of the car.   A switch from VED to petrol taxationmay therefore he expected to reduce petrol consumption: as notedin paragraph 9, the savings should be of the order of 3 to 3i Percent of total petrol consumption in the short-term, and perhapsdouble that in the longer-term.    In balance of payments terms,this would be a saving on imported petrol of around  100 millionin the short-term, and up to  200 million in the longer-term. Areduction in demand for petrol would also help to improve- UKrefinery balance: the UK is likely to remain anet importer of petrol. ;15. The need to make savings in petrol consumption is nowparticularly important.   Following the recent political eventsin Iran,    the UK has given commitments, both at the Tokyo Summitand subsequently in conjunction with our EEC partners, to limitoil imports in the years to 1985-   Petrol consumption accountsfor the largest single use of any oil product in the UK, and(except where fossil fuels can be substituted directly for oil,for example, in power stations) offers the greatest potentialscope for containing oil demand.   Petrol prices in the UK, evenafter the tax increases in the June Budget, are still in realterms only about 85 per cent of the peak price of 1975- Theoverall burden of motoring taxes in the UK (VED, fuel duty, VATand car tax) is less closely related to fuel consumption than inmost other EEC countries.Fiscal Policy Considerations16. VED on petrol-driven vehicles is estimated to raise  875million in 1979/80 - about 4 per cent of the total revenue fromindirect taxation.    It is charged at an annual rate of  50- on allcars in use on the road and there are graduated rates for othervehicles.   Taxpayers may opt for four-monthly, rather than annual,licences but must pay a 10 per cent surcharge (equivalent to anannual rate of  55&apos; on cars).V.   Petrol duty is charged at a rate equivalent to just under-VP a gallon on all petrol delivered for use in the domestic./
CONFIDENTIAL. . .10.economy and is reflected in the retail price at the pump. VATis charged on petrol at 15 per cent.   On a full year basis, theduty on petrol is estimated to raise  2,025 million and VAT onpetrol about  4-75 million in 1979/80.18. As noted in paragraph 7 above, the increase in petroltaxation required to compensate for the loss of VED on petrol-driven vehicles is I9p a gallon at 1979 prices (I6 p duty and2 p VAT).   The changeover would be broadly neutral in its effecton the BPI.19. A switch from VED to petrol taxation should also in principlebe neutral in its effects on the revenue.   But maintenance of therevenue in real terms would require additional increases in petrolduty in the period up to 1982/85 to take account of the general -increase in prices and the declining real value of VED (assumingthat VED were not increased in money terms during the changeover).And once the changeover was complete regular further increaseswould be required if the revenue from petrol duty was to bemaintained at the same level in real terms as the present revenuefrom petrol and VED combined.20. Ministers will wish to judge whether this will be feasiblegiven the political and presentational difficulties of largeincreases in the petrol duty.    It is arguable that petrol cannotbe relied upon to be a buoyant source of revenue given the risksof disruption of supplies and of sudden and rapid price increasesimposed by overseas suppliers.   Reliance on petrol taxation alonecould therefore result in a lower contribution to the revenuefrom the motoring taxes.    Furthermore, a failure to secureregular revalorisation of the petrol duty would mean that thebenefits to energy conservation assumed to flow from the abolitionof VED would not be fully achieved.21. The major disadvantage of abolishing VED, however, is thatit would reduce the Chancellor&apos;s freedom of manoeuvre making itmore difficult for him to manage the indirect taxes and to providescope for cuts in the income tax.   The range of indirect taxinstruments available for this purpose is already very limited.
CONFIDENTIAL...11An undertaking has been given not to increase VAT further duringthis Parliament.   The only other broadly-based and buoyant sourceof indirect tax revenue is the National Insurance Surcharge andthe problem about this tax is that it adds to industrial costsand reduces company liquidity - particularly unwelcome in thecircumstances likely to prevail over the next year or so. Thatleaves only the duties on oil, alcohol and tobacco.22.   Against this background, the abolition of VED as a quid proquo for an increase in the petrol duty implies a loss of potentialrevenue since the taxable capacity of petrol is available whetherVED is changed or not.   Abolition simply offers a presentationaladvantage in terms of the justification to the motorist of theincrease in petrol duty.   Retention of VED on the. other handv/ould give the Chancellor a useful measure of flexibility andcould still be combined with a policy of increasing the petrolduty to as high a level as economic circumstances permit in theinterests both of the revenue and of energy saving.Administrative and Staff Savings23.   In 1980/81 the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Centre is expectedto employ 4,650 people and its 82 local offices 2,230. Theorganisation exists to perform three main functions: to issuedriving licences, to maintain a vehicle register, and to collectand enforce vehicle excise duty on petrol-driven and other vehicles.The first two functions (undertaken entirely by DVLC) would continuewhether VED was retained on petrol-driven vehicles or not.    Only theissue of vehicle licences (currently divided between the localvehicle licensing offices and some 2,000 post offices) and enforce-Hent (divided between DVLC and LVLOs) would be affected byabolition.   For petrol-driven vehicles the licensing process (whichprovides an in-put to the vehicle register as well as a means ofcollecting tax) would be replaced by some form of annual regis-tration; enforcement would continue but in a simplified form and ata lower level of effort.24.   Whether or not VED is retained on petrol-driven vehicles,post offices could take over the LVLOs&apos;share of vehicle licensing
CONFIDENTIAL12m * * 9(or the registration process that might replace it).    The staffpaving at LVLOs would vary between 800 and 1,4-50 according tohe amount of work that had been eliminated before the transfertook place, and whether the Post Office could handle the morecomplicated first registration transactions.   Post Office chargeswould offset the saving in staff costs so there would be no net-financial saving.   There would however be a resource saving asthe Post Office would absorb most &apos;of the work with their existingstaff: they would expect to recruit only another 200-300. Thechange would also provide a more convenient service for themotoring public.ABOLITION25-   The abolition of VED on petrol-driven vehicles would providea further saving of 1,600 staff (670 at DVLC and 930 at LVLOs).These would come mainly from the elimination of four-monthlylicensing and of refunds, and from reductions in enforcement.The transfer of registration work to post offices would add afurther saving of 800 - 1,000 staff (all at LVLOs), bring thetotal staff saving to 2,400 - 2,600.    There would be an equivalentfinancial saving of  15 million p.a.    The cost of the registrationsystem would be recovered through an annual registration fee. Afee of  2 would approximately cover current costs and would provideadditional revenue of  28 million p.a.26.   For the longer-term the Department of Transport could considerwith the insurance companies whether it might be practicable tocombine registration with motor insurance eg. companies might renewpolicies, issue a windscreen disc to record both insurance andregistration, and pass DVLC whatever details they needed to up-datethe vehicle register.   The companies would thus take over the workwhich had earlier been transferred to post offices.   Unlike thepost offices, however, they might be expected to pass informationto DVLC in computer readable form.    If all the information couldbe provided in this way there would be a further saving of 1,100sta f (all at DVLC) bringing the total to 3500-3700.   Whether therewould be a financial saving would depend on the charges raised bythe insurance companies for the additional work they would be
CONFIDENTIAL* * *    . adoing.    It has not yet been established that the change would bepracticable and it could not be implemented before DVLC replacetheir mainframe computers in 1983-85.    But if practicable itcould provide both a more effective registration system andeasier enforcement of-insurance.RETENTION27. If Ministers decide that VED is to be retained there arethree possible ways in which savings additional to those arisingfrom transferring licensing to post offices might be obtained:-(a) by abolishing four-monthly licences or replacingthem by six-monthlies;(b) by abolishing refunds;(c) by making VED a tax on the possession of a vehiclerather than its use on the public road.These savings would however be partly offset by the increase of150 which would be needed in the staff employed on enforcement,at an administrative cost of  1 million -p.a..(a)   Abolition of four-monthly licences28. The abolition of four-monthly licences (used by 5*5 millionvehicle owners) would run counter to the present trend of allowingbills to be paid by instalments.    It would save 100 staff at DVLCand,A50 staff at LVLOs.    (The LVLO staff would however be savedanyway if their work was transferred to post offices.) Therewould be a saving in administrative costs of  8 million p.a. Theloss of revenue from the 10 per cent surcharge on the four-monthlylicence (after allowing for realistic rates of interest on thedeferred payments) would be  22 million p.a. at current rates of -duty.
CONFIDENTIAL14* *  a *29. The replacement of four-monthly licences by six-monthlieswould save 50 staff at DVLC and 250 staff at LVLOs.    (The LVLO -staff would again be saved anyway by transferring the work topost offices.)   There would be a financial saving of iA- million pAa.In addition a 10 per cent surcharge on a six-monthly licence wouldproduce additional revenue of  4 million p.a.  (again after allowingfor realistic rates of interest) by comparison with that obtainedon four-monthly licences.30. The effect of abolishing or. lengthening short-period licencescould be tempered by a savings stamp scheme.    This might be intro-duced before any change took place (or even if there Avas not to bea change at all).    It would probably be widely used, althoughinitially motorists would have both to pay for their existinglicence and buy stamps for a new one.   The scheme might slightlyincrease costs - the Post Office would charge more for handlinglicences if they had to accept stamps.   The Department of Transportis pursuing the possibility.Abolition of refunds31. The main effect of abolishing refunds (of which there arearound 1-J million a year) would be to prevent dealers (and privatemotorists) selling second hand cars from trading in the unexpiredlicence.    (This would presumably be reflected in the subsequentsale price.)   Motorists whose vehicles were off the road forlengthy repairs or because they themselves were ill or abroad wouldalso be worse off.   There would be a staff saving of 200 (all atDVLC) and an equivalent financial saving of  1 million p.a. Inaddition there would be a gain to the revenue of upwards of  5Billion p.a.IgJ^Tax on possession32. VED is at present chargeable on a vehicle only if it is usedQn the public roads.   A tax on possession would mean that a vehiclebad to remain taxed throughout its lifetime; in other words, norefunds would be available and no gaps in licensing would be
CONFIDENTIAL.15.permitted.    As with abolition, those most affected would besellers of secondhand vehicles and motorists who for reasonsbeyond their control had to keep their vehicle off the roads.Administrative savings would also be the same as from the abolitionof refunds: 200 staff and  1 million p.a.    There would be a gainto the revenue of around  20 million p.a.    In the short-term therenight he some increase in evasion, but the change would open theway to improved methods of enforcement on the basis of the computerrecord instead of solely on on-the-road checks on licence discs.This could offer further savings of perhaps 2-300 staff and  2million p.a.33-   In theory all three of these changes could be consideredseparately.   In practice abolition of four-monthly licences andof refunds ought to be taken together: abolition of one by itselfis otherwise likely to lead to an increase in demand for the other.A tax on possession would do away with the need for refunds but itcould he combined with the continuation of short period licences,since there would be no incentive to switch to a shorter licencein expectation of a vehicle being temporarily off the road. Anyof these options might be expected to lead, in the short term atleast, to some increase in evasion: this could lead to some erosionof the savings if extra staff were required to deal with thisincrease.34. The savings under each of these options and from VED abolitionare set out in the table on the following page.

The Department of Transport are not at present able to say whether the changes to the vehicle registration system needed :the new methods of enforcement could be completed before they begin to replace the comuuters at DVLC in 1983 but they Would trimake them before that date.

CONFIDENTIAI17involve several months&apos; preparatory work and phasing would beessential.   Priority would be given to changes which did mostto reduce the work load (abolition of VED or replacement/abolitionof four-monthly licences); the staged transfer of work to postoffices and any change to a tax on possession and new methods ofenforcement could follow.36. Legislation would be required for all the changes except thetransfer of work to post offices, but all except that requiredfor a change to a tax on possession would not be complex.37. Although there would not be time to introduce an insurance-linked registration scheme (if one   is practicable) before 1983, ajoint study with the insurance companies might be- initiated as soonas any decision to abolish VED was announced.jOTHER PUBLIC EXPENDITURE COSTS \38. The most important effect on Government spending programmesother than for the Department of Transport, the police or thecourts would be on benefits for the disabled.    At present variousgroups enjoy full exemption from VED, and would lose this if thecost of VED were transferred to petrol prices.    There would beconsiderable pressure to compensate them for this loss. DHSSestimate that compensation could cost up to  8 million a year.39-   Many public service vehicles (for example, Crown vehicles,ambulances, fire engines) are also exempt from VED.   The transferof VED to petrol prices would add to costs on the public expen-diture programmes concerned..Hi.    OTHER POSSIBLE REFORMS IN VED STRUCTURE4-0.   The Group has also considered two other possible changeswhich might be ir;ade in the structure of VED if it is retained.
CONFIDENTIALHA.   The first is a simplification of the rate structure. Thereare at present some 250 rates of VED covering vehicles otherthan cars and heavy lorries, eg. lighter goods vehicles, andagricultural and other machines.    Simplification of tax classesand rates would make the system easier for the public to under-stand and would facilitate the transfer of work to post offices.It should be possible to make the change without loss of revenue.But the elimination of some special rates and merging of otherswould inevitably mean that some vehicle owners would lose- (or notgain as much as they thought they should).   The legislation couldtherefore be controversial.4-2.   The second possible change is to a graduated system of VED.The suggestion is frequently made (most recently by the formerSecretary of State for Transport) that a graduated system of VEDwould encourage the purchase of more energy-efficient cars andmake the tax more progressive.   Almost all EEC countries levytheir VED equivalent on a scale and a recent EEC study hassuggested that this was a positive though minor factor influencingconsumers to purchase more economical cars.    The energy savings,however, are likely to be small.    The most easily practicablebasis for a graduated system would be the cubic capacity of theengine.   This is not an accurate guide to the fuel economy of acar and is likely to become less so.    The old graduated system ofVED (based on h.p. rating) was abolished in 19^8 because it imposedartificial constraints on engine design, and this objection stillapplies.   The motor industry have made it clear that they would bestrongly opposed to its reintroduction.   The mainadvantage of agraduated scale would be presentational - many people regard thepresent system, whereby a Mini is liable to the same VED as aRolls-Royce, as unfair.    A graduated scale might therefore make iteasier to raise more revenue from VED.    But the Group concludedthat the disadvantages would outweigh any gains and that agraduated VED was not an option worth pursuing further.
CONFIDENTIAL.19.IV.    SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS43.   The background has changed in a number of respects since theLabour Government announced its decision to abolish VED on petrol-driven vehicles in November 1978.    The recent increases in oilprices mean that the energy savings to be gained from the corapen-sating petrol tax Increase are lower than they would have beenlast year, though with a potential benefit of  100 million to thebalance of payments in the short-term, and up to  200 million inthe long-term, they are still worthwhile.   The impact of the petroltax increase on the motor industry is now a less significant factorin the debate than it has been in past years.    But the argumentsthat abolition will dispose of the problem of VED evasion and thatthe switch could mean a fairer basis for the motoring taxes, arestill valid.W.   In view of the importance the Government attaches to incometea: reductions and to cutting the size of the public sectorMinisters will wish to give special consideration to the fiscalarguments and the administrative savings.The fiscal argument against the abolition of VED is that itwould deprive the Chancellor of a useful tax instrument and,by increasing his dependence on petrol duty as a source ofindirect tax revenue, could reduce the scope for futureincome tea: reductions.   Retention of VED v/ould allow formore flexibility in raising indirect taxation and could becombined with increasing petrol duty as high as economiccircumstances permit.The administrative argument for abolition is that it wouldproduce direct savings of 1,600 staff and  15 million by theend of 1982, with possibly an additional saving of 1,000staff within the same timescale from transferring theresidual work on registration to post offices, and a furthersaving of 1,100 staff in the longer-term if the insurancecompanies were prepared to take on part of the work ofmaintaining the vehicle register. &apos; It would be a highlyvisible expression of the Government1s determination toreduce the size and cost of the civil service.... /
COKFIDEMTIAL.20.If YEP were retained, the maximum net saving would in theshort-term be 600 staff and  8 million p.a. (even ifunpopular measures such as abolition of short-periodlicences and refunds were taken), with possibly another1,000 from transferring work to post offices and in thelonger-term 200-300 staff and  2 million p.a. from improvedmethods of enforcement direct from the computer record.45-   The question of the future of VED is closely bound up with theLord President&apos;s present exercise on staff savings.    It would bedifficult for the Government to announce a major package of measuresand to have to say that no decision had yet been reached on savingson VED.   An early decision is therefore needed.46.   rlinisters are invited:(a)   To decide whether VED on petrol-driven vehicles shouldbe abolished or retained.(b) If VED is to be abolished:(i) to authorise the early resumption of consultationsabout timing, diesel taxation and other relatedissues;(ii) to decide whether discussions should be opened onthe possibility of an insurance-linked regis-tration system.(c) If VED is to be retained:(i) to consider whether staff savings should be soughtand, if so, what they should be (i.e. should short-period licences and refunds be abolished, and shoulda tax on possession be introduced?);(ii) to consider whether the possibility of graduatedrates of duty for cars should be pursued further.
ANNEX &apos;1HEWS OF INTERESTED PARTIESFollowing the previous Government&apos;s announcement of its decisionto abolish VED, meetings to discuss the timing of the phasingprocess and other related issues were held with the three mainorganisations concerned: the Society of Motor Manufacturers andTraders (representing the UK car industry), the Petroleum IndustryAdvisory Council (representing the oil companies) and the MotorAgents Association (representing the independent petrol retailers),lone was prepared to give a final view on timing without furtherinformation on, for example, the Government&apos;s intentions on dieseltaxation.   Their main concerns were:-(a) the size of the compensating petrol tax increase(which all three sought - on different grounds - tochallenge);(b) the viability of the post-VED registration system (SMMT);(c) the implications of the petrol tax increase and associatedcosts for an already contracting trade (MAa and to alesser extent PIAC).2.   A large number of written representations, both from organi-sations and individual members of the public, were also received.As might be expected, the bulk of correspondence was from peoplewho objected to the change, though a number of MPs from both sidesexpressed support for the proposal on the grounds that it wouldreduce tax evasion and bureaucracy.   The major organisations whowrote included the Confederation of British Industry, AutomobileAssociation, Royal Automobile Club, National Consumer Council, theRetail Consortium, the Freight Transport Association and theNational Farmers Union.(1) Almost all objected to the lack of prior consultation.(2) Other objections, either to the detail or the broadprinciples of the proposal, were* /
ANNEX 1(coritd. )(a) the effect that the change would have on highmileage motorists (including many business users)who would incur higher costs;(b) concern about the enforcement of MOT testing,insurance and registration requirements;(c) worries about essential rural use, especially inScotland, and the effect on tourism;(d) complaints from retailers that they would faceadditional compliance costs (financing the duty,increased cash handling etc.);(e) queries about the basis for the calculation thatan increase of I9p a gallon would be needed onpetrol taxation to compensate for the loss of VEDrevenue.3.   Those enjoying concessionary rates of VED protested about theincrease in costs for agricultural vehicles, taxis, motorcyclesand disabled motorists.    The main complaint came from people whouse petrol (or other light oil) and do not pay VED.    The bestorganised lobby was light aviation (over 110 separate represen--tations have been received) who sought exemption from any dutyincrease to be imposed to recoup the revenue from VED.4-.   About 20 organisations have been in favour of the switch.These include various conservation groups, the Advisory Councilon Energy Conservation, the National Union of Railwaymen and theNational Consumer Council - the last on the grounds that the switchwill help those on lower incomes and encourage fuel economy.
CONFIDENTIALANNEX 2ISSUES CONNECTED V/ITH YEP ABOLITIONThere are a number of issues in connection with the abolitionof VED on petrol-driven vehicles which would need to be con-sidered further if Ministers decide to proceed with abolition.The main points are summarised in this note.A.   The Vehicle Registration System2.   The vehicle register maintained by DVLC is used not onlyfor the enforcement of VED but also to trace drivers involvedin traffic or other offences (including serious crime) or inaccidents; to recall defective vehicles; and to provideessential marketing information for the motor industry.    If VEDwere abolished, all this would have to continue.3*   The SMMT, in particular, have expressed the fear thatwithout VED the motoring public would fail to take an obli-gation for annual re-registration seriously.   The requirementwould however still be enforced: there would still be a wind-screen disc and anyone not displaying it would be committingan offence.   The abolition of VED would itself remove themajor disincentive to re-register/re-licensing.    It is a matterof judgement whether the requirement to re-register would belikely to be taken more seriously with or without an admini-strative fee (the normal policy is to charge one) but on thewhole it seems likely that a fee would help to ensure that itwas taken seriously.4. If, in the longer-term, registration could be linked withinsurance, the likelihood of its being taken seriously wouldbe very greatly strengthened.    Since the disc would coverinsurance as well as registration the enforcement of insurancewould be strengthened as well.5. If VED is retained, the position will be broadly as now,though increased enforcement should tend to improve the accuracof the registers
CONFIDENTIALANNEX 2(page 2)The Taxation of Diesel-Powered VehiclesThe motor manufacturers said that they could not commentdequately on the main proposal to abolish VED on petrol-drivenehicles until the proposals for the future taxation of dieselere known.   A separate consultation paper was promised but wastill in preparation when consultations were suspended.There are a number of related issues concerning the taxationdiesel vehicles and the duty on diesel road fuel (DERV) onhich decisions will need to be taken if VED on petrol-drivenehicles is abolished.    Heavy goods vehicles are all diesel-owered.   Proposals for restructuring VED for these vehicles toeflect more closely road costs were made in a consultativeocument issued by the Minister of Transport on 3 August: theseroposals apply irrespective of the outcome of the wider reviewfVED.   But if Ministers decide in favour of abolition onietrol vehicles, there would be a strong case for increasingiesel duty as with petrol duty and abolishing VED on theighter goods vehicles diesel cars.   VED would then only beayable on the 275,000 heaviest lorries.Traditionally, the duty on petrol and diesel fuel haseen the same, but since 1977 when a proposed increase in petrol&quot;ty was lost, diesel has been dutied at 5p per gallon more thanetrol.   On energy conservation and refinery balance grounds therere arguments for a more favourable treatment of diesel fuel,ut these arguments need to be weighed against the fact thathe UK motor industry does not at present produceDiesel car and has no immediate capacity to do so.    The motorndustry, through the SMMT, have stated that they see no caseor subsidising either diesel or petrol engined vehicles and thatIta present tax disadvantage to diesel fuel should be removed./e * * /
CONFIDENTIALANNEX 2Cpage 3)C. Electric Vehicles9o   The then Financial Secretary announced on 2 April that VEDon electric vehicles would be abolished along with that onpetrol-driven vehicles.   There is a strong case on energy policyand environmental grounds for encouraging the development ofelectric vehicles.   There are ,at present only about 34,000elactric vehicles liable to pay VED., the vast majority of thembeing milk floats, and the cost to the revenue of abolishing VEDon these vehicles would be less than  2 million a year.10. A decision to abolish VED on electric vehicles could betaken independently of the outcome of the wider review forannouncement as part of either an abolition or retention package.D. Non-Road Users of Petrol11. The increased cost of petrol for motorists would be offsetby the abolition of VED, but other users of petrol would have topay the extra petrol taxation with no compensating saving.There has been considerable protest from people who use petrolbut do not pay VED about the proposal to recoup VED revenue byadditional taxation of light hydrocarbon oil.   They obviouslyhave reasonable grounds for complaint, but any attempt to relievepetrol not for road fuel use from the duty increase would causesevere enforcement problems for Customs and Excise.12. The best organised and most vocal lobby are the users oflight aircraft which run on aviation spirit (AVGAS).   They claimthat it would be possible to distinguish AVGAS from other petroland the danger of evasion of full-rate petrol duty would besmall.   If the decision were to go ahead with abolition of VEDit would be necessary to consider whether a concession to lightaviation were practicable and justifiable.    It would be out ofthe question to make a similar kind of concession to other petrolusers, since such a relief would be impossible to control.
CONFIDENTIALANNEX 3BggECT OF VSD ABOLITION ON MOTORING COSTSGeneral1, With a petrol tax increase of 19p a gallon, the two-thirdsof motorists who at present take out annual licences would needto use 260 gallons a year before they began to pay more tax asa result of abolition;   the one-third who take out 4-monthlylicences (on which they pay a surcharge of 10 per cent) wouldneed to use about 290 gallons.2, These gallonage figures represent the following break evenannual mileages:At 2 5 mop;        At 30 mug        At 35 mpg260 gallons..... 6500 7900 9100290 gallons..... 7250 8700 101503, The average mileage of motorists in Great Britain is 8700 milesa year, of which about 10 per cent of the mileage done by privatelyowned cars is for business purposes.   But the average mileage is also&quot;eighted by the very high mileage done by a relatively small numberof motorists.    Some 7i out of 14 million motorists do less than8000 miles (including business motoring) and would be likely to breakwen or gain from abolition.   Another 1 million do less than 8000miles private motoring, although they do some business motoring inaddition.   About 5 million motorists do between 8000 and 15$000 miles^ if this was all private mileage and they paid for YED, could loseUP to  45 a year.    The remaining 1-g- million motorists who also do0ver 15,000 miles a year would find their costs increased&apos; by morethan this.   However, at the higher mileages, a substantial proportion&quot;f motoring is done for business purposes and the VAT element in thePetrol tax increase would be deductible.
CONFIDNEITALANNEX 3 contd.siness MotoristsIn general business motorists cover substantially higherlleages than private motorists and hence, in most cases, wouldIce an increase in costs as a result of a switch from VED toHrol taxation.    The increase in total business costs istimated to be of the order of  100 millions.    To the extentat this could not be passed on immediately in higher prices,ere would be a worsening of business liquidity.ral MotoristsAbout 3 million out of 14 million motorists are defined inle National Travel Survey as 1 rural&apos;.   The average-annual mileageir rural motorists is about 9700 miles on private and businessitoring compared with the national average of 8700.    (About 2000this 9700 is accounted for by business motoring). Familyipenditure Survey data indicate that rural motorists generallyitain better than average fuel consumption, presumably becauseley drive on less congested reads.   At 35 mpg the rural motoristaverage mileage who had been buying an annual licence would bexmt  2.50 a year worse off as a result of abolition, and  2.50year better off if he had been buying 4-monthly licences. Itas been suggested that in some rural areas (eg. the Highlands of-otland) road conditions are such that rural motorists get worseat her than better average fuel consumption.   At 25 mpg and 9700 miltyear a motorist would be between  20 and  25 a year worse off asresult of abolition.These figures assume no change in the fuel efficiency ofNicies used by rural motorists.    But higher petrol pricesculd give an incentive to reduce fuel consumption and in the0r)g term motorists, especially those who travel high mileages,0uld be expected tc choose more economical vehicles.   The lowerai(l, who tend tc do a lower mileage than average, might alsoxPect to benefit proportionately more.
