CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 59 COPY NO    g 1[4 December 1979CABINETAGRICULTURENote by the Secretory of the Cabinet1. At its meeting on 4 October 1979 (CC(79) 16th Conclusions, Minute 3)the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food (C(79) 41) proposing an early increase of l^p per pint,from 15p to Ibjrp, in the maximum retail price of milk.    The Cabinetagreed that there should be no increase in the retail price of milk at thatstage, and that the question of milk prices should be looked at in the broadercontext of support for agriculture generally and against the background of theCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the subsidies which other membersof the European Economic Community (EEC) gave to their agriculturalindustries.2, The review has been undertaken by an Official Group (MISC 23),whose report is attached.    It gives both the context and the detailedconsiderations for three decisions which the Cabinet is now invited to take:-i.       Whether or not to undertake a devaluation of the green Poundin the immediate future.    The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheriesand Food proposes that he should seek a devaluation of 5 per centat the EEC Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on Monday10 December,    The case for this appears to be strong.ii.      Whether or not to increase the maximum retail price of milk.The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food confirms hisearlier proposal for a l^p per pint increase as soon as possible.If there is no increase, the profit margin will fall very sharplyindeed;  the British consumer would gain from having milk that muchcheaper;  the British balance of payments would lose to the extentthat we imported more butter;  the Exchequer would gain its shareof the savings to the EEC of less butter being sold into intervention.At some stage, EEC milk output will have to be cut and a step by theUnited Kingdom to reduce its own output by lowering the profitabilityof milk could be presented as a move in this direction.    But it isquestionable whether Britain should take this step alone.    Apart fromfarmers&apos; profit margins another argument for some increase in theprice of milk is that at the next meeting of Agriculture Ministers ofthe EEC the United Kingdom will be taking a tough line and our ownfarming industry will be affected e. g. by an increase in the co-responsibility levy.    A rise in the retail price of milk would help to1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALshield our own industry from part of the effects of the tough positionwe will need to take.    One possible course would be to go for someincrease in the retail price of milk, but less than the l^p per pintwhich the Minister proposes.iii.      What to do about farm capital grants, a decision on which isrequired in order to complete the current public expenditure review.The Public Expenditure Survey (PES) provision in the inherited plansfor 1983-84 is  160 million at 1979 Survey prices.    The ChiefSecretary, Treasury, proposes that this figure should be reduced by 60 million, and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodproposes that it   should be increased by  30 million.    Either changewould be achieved by means of a change in the percentage rates ofgrant payable on applications after 1 January 1980, and an Order forthis purpose would need to be laid in Parliament before the Christmasrecess.    There would be consequential adjustments to the PESfigures for 1981-82, 1982-83 and 1984-85.    In the medium term areduction in EEC agricultural output is necessary.     An increase inthe rate of capital investment would appear to point in the oppositedirection.    On the other hand, a decrease in the rate of grantimplied by the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposals (55 per cent) would bevery steep.    The choice appears to be between no change and adecrease smaller than that proposed by the Chief Secretary.Signed   ROBERT ARMSTRONGCabinet Office4 December 19792CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALAGRICULTUREREPORT BY THE OFFICIAL GROUP (MISC 23)INTRODUCTION1. The Group was set up following the Cabinet&apos;s discussion of liquid milkprices on 4 October 1979.2. The Group consisted of representatives of the Treasury, the Foreign andCommonwealth Office, the Department of Employment, the Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food, the Department of Trade, and the Central Policy ReviewStaff under Cabinet Office Chairmanship.    In addition the Scottish, Welsh andNorthern Ireland Agriculture Departments were represented at a number of theGroup&apos;s meetings.3. Ministers will shortly need to take decisions on three issues concerningagricultural support.- Whether to devalue the Green   by 5 per cent as recommended by theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,    (if Ministers ao decide, it maybe desirable tactically to secure this decision at the EEC AgricultureCouncil meeting on 10 December, so as to get it out of the way beforethe annual price-fixing begins.    So it is desirable to have a decision oneway or the other before then.)- Whether or not to increase the maximum retail price of milk by 1-^-p per pintas recommended by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.- Whether to reduce the level of farm capital grants as recommended bythe Chief Secretary, Treasury, or to increase them as recommended by theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.    (This decision is necessaryin order to complete this year&apos;s public expenditure review.    If the levelof grant is to be changed from 1 January 1980, an Order to this effect willneed to be laid in Parliament before the Christmas Recess.)1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. The purpose of this report is to enable these issues to he looked at inthe broader context of support for agriculture generally, and against thebackground of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the subsidies which otheimembers of the EEC give to their agricultural industries.THE UNITED KINGDOM AGEICULTURAL INDUSTRY5. Agriculture consists of 250,000 individual farms requiring widely varyinginputs, producing a wide range of commodities and facing differences of scale andof kind in the problems and opportunities they face. There is little resemblan]between cash cropping on large, heavily mechanised farms in East Anglia, and smallremote island farms or extensive hill farming in the uplands of southern Scotland,northern England or Wales. In totaL agriculture, accounts for 2.7 per cent of theUnited Kingdonfs gross domestic product - about  3500 million in 1979 - and a similpercatage of civilian employment. Industries and services closely associated withagriculture account for about another 4 per cent in each case.6. Agricultural production has for many years been on a rising trend. The industry&apos;net product has been increasing in volume by 2j per cent a year, and theproportion of our total consumption of temperate foods produced in theUnited Kingdom has risen from 62 per cent in 1970 to 70 per cent today.   At the 1same time, the industry&apos;s usage of material inputs has remained virtually constantand both its land usage and the size of its labour force have decreased. Thevolume of output per man has been rising at an average rate of 4 per cent a year.tead7. The growth of production and productivity is attributable to improvementsin the yields of crops and livestock, the adoption of new technology, and the senlargement of productive units which have given economies of scale. The industryhas become increasingly capital-intensive and farmers have been able to use capitallabour and other resources flexibly to achieve the most economic and productive jcombination.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALFinancial Position and Prospects8.     Table 1 below shows trends in farm incomes according to two indicators,farming net income which is a published series and farm family cash income (aconcept devised for this Group) which shows profitability as the farmer himselfmight perceive it in the short term.    The main differences between the twoseries are that farm family cash income does not count the costs of depreciationor of family labour, but does include as a cost annual expenditure on fixed assetsnet of grantB    It also values stock changes at potential market prices rather thanat cost (see also graph A at end.)TABLE 1.1970   1973   1975   1976   1977   1978   1979 1980forecast projectionlarNet farm income  mFcim family cashincome  mNil in real terms1975 = 100FF-T in real terms1975 - 100479 871   923 1137 1300 1120 1047750 1190 1470 1840 1550 1800 187096 136   100 106 104 83 6894 116   100 107 78 84 77[835][1710]C V ][ 61 ]Beth series show a decline in real income from the mid 1970s to 1978 with afurther decline from 1978 to 1979j9.     The projections for 1980 assume no change in EEC common prices, no change^,jy in the green pound, and no increase in the retail price of liquid milk, but theyinclude the recently announced increases in aids to hill farmers.    Costs areasiumed to rise broadly in line with inflation and the farm wage bill to increaseI      V 19 per cent following the recent award announced by the Agricultural Wages Board.Output prices have been taken to rise, reflecting market trends and increases inI      tha pipeline following earlier green pound changes.    The projections show thatthere will be a significant decline in real incomes from 1979 to 1980 unless actionis taken to avert it**The measures of financial performance included in the report are mostly those whichnave been conventionally adopted in recent years to assess farmers&apos; income position.However, discussions in the Group have indicated the desirability of a further analysisQf the existing measures of income,and an exercise is to be conducted by theAgricultural Departments and the Treasury over the coming months. It is not suggested,however, that any new index will materially alter the projection of a fall in incomenext year if no action is taken.CONFIDENTIAL

The assumptions for 1980 are the sameas for the previous table.TABLE 2TRENDS IN NET MARGINS (1975/76 = 100)1973/ 1974/ 1975/ 1976/ 1977/ 1978/ 1979/80 1980/8174       75       76       77       78       79   forecast [projection]Money values								Cereals, potatoes, sugar beet	75	73	100	127	66	106	100	[76] 1Beef, pigs, sheep, poultrymeat	58	Loss	110	89	100	110	98	[108]Milk, eggs	73	25	100	73	129	94	89	[35] ITotal	70	43	100	105	89	104	97	[76] 1Real terms								ICereals, potatoes, sugar beet	110	90	100	110	50	75	61	[40]Beef, pigs, sheep, poultrymeat	85	Loss	100	77	76	77	60	[58] IMilk, eggs	107	31	100	64	98	66	54	[18] 1Total	102	54	100 &apos;	91	67	73	59	[40]The net margin estimates are based on University Surveys in England and Walesof the main enterprises. They provide indicators of changes in the return tothe farmer for his management and investment devoted to their production.11.    The squeeze on incomes in the current year has been borne mainly by thelivestock sectors, especially the hill and upland farms which are not includein the table, and which account for 20 per cent of the total United Kingdomcattle breeding herd and 57 per cent of the sheep breeding flock.   In thissector incomes in 1979/80 have been estimated to be between 15 per cent and60 per cent lower than in 1978/79, with the largest falls occurring inScotland and Northern Ireland.    These declines reflect the consequences ofthe hard winter in 1979 and low prices, particularly for sheep, at the presentCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALtime.    The prospects for 1980 are an improvement in margins for beef, pigsand sheep, but a severe decline in the crops sector and in milk, where .increases in workers&apos; wages will have a particularly marked effect.Asset position of agriculture12. Farmers&apos; borrowing from banks, the greater part of their liabilities,have increased repidly in 1979 and are currently 33 per cent higher than atthe same time in 1978.    The increased borrowings are a consequence of decliningreal income, and thus the falling retentions of profits for investment purposes,but liabilities are only 7 per cent of networth compared with 14 per cent in1970 (see Table A at end).    80 per cent of the industry&apos;s assets are land andbuildings.    As a result of the rapid rise in land values, from  1200 a hectarein 1976 to  2200 in 1978 and  3100 in 1979, total assets have risen sharplyand the value of an average full-time farm is now  340,000.    While land valuesremain buoyant the credit worthiness of owner occupiers, who account for60 per cent of the land, should therefore remain sound.    But only just over1 per cent of land area is marketed each year, and thus an increase in salesarising from an income squeeze could generate a price fall.    A further increasein borrowing, using land as collateral, would be possible and could provide aueasure of income support to owner occupiers, but would carry a long-term cost,[t is also questionable whether farmers will continue to invest in farming, iftheir incomes from farming, as distinct from their rising assets in land andbuildings, continue to decline.13. Investment in agriculture grew in real terms by 14 per cent between 1970md 1973.    Thereafter it fell back, but by 1979 it is forecast to have recovereddmost to the level of 1973 (Table B at end). Both the initial rise and the subsequentall were greater than the changes in investment in the economy as a whole over;he same period. Most of the fluctuation in agricultural investment has beenin investment in buildings and works. Investment in plant and machinery grewrapidly between 1970 and 1972 and has thereafter remained at roughly the same1evel.SUPPORT SYSTEMSOperation of the CAP14. For most agricultural commodities produced in the United Kingdom, thesupport arrangements are now laid down by CAP market regulations.    (The mainexceptions are sheepmeat and potatoes.)     Most CAP regimes operate on the5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALprinciple of managing commodity markets so that prices are high enough to givethe producer what is judged to he the appropriate level of return. The&apos; standardmodel is one in which market prices are raised to the desired level by raisingthe price of third country imports through variable levies (import levies), bjremoving home production from the market (intervention), and by encouragingexports, by repaying the difference between Community prices and world prices I(export restitutions).15. There is some scope within the regulations, and subject to Community law,for member states to follow national policies.    The United Kingdom, for example,has maintained arrangements for milk which depend heavily on controls overliquid prices and health regulations which restrict imports.16. CAP support levels within each regime are set by means of &quot;common&quot;institutional prices which apply within the different mechanisms.    These pricesand amounts are fixed for the Community as a whole in units of account and areconverted into national currencies at fixed exchange rates known as &quot;green rates&quot;By refusing to change their green rates by as much as the market rates of theircurrencies change, member states are able to manipulate their national prices!to suit their own economic and political needs.    In 1978, for example, thecommon price level was on average 33 per cent above the United Kingdom supportprice level.    It is now about 10 per cent above.Support to Agriculture in EEC Member States17. In addition to CAP mechanisms, all member states pay national aids toagriculture.    It is only possible to make rough comparisons of the value ofthese aids, and the results of a comparison by MAFF are shown at Table C atthe end of the report.    They give only a broad indication of the position,but they show the United Kingdom well down towards the bottom of the list.Agricultural Incomes18. One of the reasons for this is that the social problems of farmers andagricultural workers are greater in the rest of the EEC.    A simple comparisoof incomes per head in agriculture in the United Kingdom and in other EECcountries shows that only in the United Kingdom are agricultural incomesroughly equivalent to the national average.   However in part the reason forthis is that a higher proportion of farmers elsewhere are part-time and soCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhave other sources of income.    Hence it is more sensible to compare incomeson full-time farms only.    But even in this case the average income per headof all those working on farms is significantly higher, relative to non-agricultural earnings, in the United Kingdom than in any other country(eg, on 57 per cent of farms income per head is more than 120 per cent ofaverage non-agricultural earnings, compared with the EEC figure of 31 per cent).Comparison of support to agriculture with support to manufacturing industryin the United Kingdom19. The basic difference between support to agriculture and to other industriesin the United Kingdom is that farmers have a guaranteed outlet for their mainproducts at assured prices.   Manufacturing industry does not have such securityin the market.    On the other hand agriculture is subject to some uncertaintiessuch as the weather and the incidence of disease, which do not affect manu-facturing industry.   Moreover Government support to manufacturing industry hasbeen given in a more sporadic way than has been the case with agriculturalsupport.20. As regards import protection, United Kingdom agriculture has far moreorotection against imports from third countries than does United Kingdomaanufacturing industry.   But manufacturing industry does, at least, enjoy thesame measure of protection as its counterparts in the other EEC countries.5o far as agriculture is concerned, because of the green currency arrangements,ohe level of import protection varies from one country to another.    The sizes)f these differences are expressed in the monetary compensatory amounts whichire used to adjust the level of import levies each member state applies againstbird countries.    They also apply, as appropriate, as levies or subsidies inntra-community trade.21. It follows that the comparison between United Kingdom agriculture andUnited Kingdom manufacturing industry differs depending on whether one islooking at third country trade or intra-community trade.    As regards thirdoountry trade the average level of tariff on manufactured goods is equivalentto about 8 per cent of value added by United Kingdom manufacturing industrywhilst agricultural levies are equivalent to about 42 per cent of value addedby United Kingdom agriculture.    As regards intra-community trade, there is noprotection for manufacturing industry and agriculture faces imports which aresubsidised through the MCA system.    The size of this subsidy varies in accordance7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwith the origin of the imports.    At current green and market rates of exchangithe range is from 2.3 per cent for imports from Italy to 22 per cent forimports from Germany.    The intention of the MCAs is to bridge the differencebetween support prices in the various member states although in practice theydo sometimes over or under compensate for this.    There are no price supportarrangements for manufacturing products (though for some products, eg textilescar, TV tubes, there are anti-dumping and trade restricting agreements).22. There are different United Kingdom regimes of investment support foragriculture and for manufacturing industry.    In 1978 grants represented some13 per cent of gross capital formation in agriculture but only 9 per cent inmanufacturing industry.    (The public expenditure figures were  129 m and  534respectively.)   Following the recent changes the figure for manufacturingindustry will be about one-third less in coming years.    In agriculture capitalgrants are available on investment in buildings and works but not generally oinvestment in plant and machinery.    The rates differ as between the types ofexpenditure and geographical areas, but the average rate in less favoured area]is over 40 per cent and 22 per cent elsewhere.    In manufacturing industrycapital grants mainly take the form of regional development grants on ihvest-ment in plant and machinery, though there is also some expenditure under theIndustry Act.   RDGs have hitherto been paid at rates of 20-22 per cent buthave recently been reduced to 15 per cent in the development areas while atthe same time the coverage of the total assisted areas has been reduced.23. Some difference of treatment might be justified because, with a greaterproportion of investment in buildings and works, the average lifetime ofagricultural investment is longer than that of manufacturing investment - thelonger lived the asset the larger the proportionate grant needed to producethe same change in the post-grant rate of return.   But in any case, investmenis also supported by investment tax allowances.    If we deal with buildings andlworks only then manufacturing is treated slightly more favourably than agri-culture;    partly because of higher initial depreciation allowances and partlybecause RDGs are not netted off in calculating tax allowances.    The two togetimply that to put agriculture and manufacturing on the same footing (in areaswhere RDGs are payable) capital grants for agricultural buildings and worksshould be about four percentage points higher.   But the actual difference inlevels of grant is much bigger than this.    In the case of plant and machinery8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhowever, RDG grants paid to manufacturing industry are also not netted offin calculating tax allowances which is a further benefit to that sector.24. MAFF believe that a considerable difference in treatment between industryand agriculture can be justified because agriculture with its greater proportionof investment in buildings and works is able to make less use than manufacturingof the more generous tax allowances (and tax leasing arrangements) on plant andmachinery.    Also agriculture, being composed of unincorporated businesses isoften unable to take full advantage of the allowances.    Thus it is not clearthat, within the development areas at least, the total value of all grants andtax allowances on all agricultural investment is more than the total value ofall grants and tax allowances on manufacturing investment, even though agri-cultural investment programmes with the same mix of buildings and machineryas a given manufacturing project might receive more assistance.25. The Treasury   do   not accept that this is a relevant consideration. Theybelieve that it is reasonable that sectors with different weightings betweenthe types of investment should have different weighted tax treatment, and thatfarmers are as capable as other sectors of arranging their affairs to make tlaximum use of tax allowances, and indeed they have been helped to do so by:he special tax averaging arrangements introduced by the 1978 Finance Act.lence they believe that differences in tax treatment only marginally offsetshe substantially more preferential levels of capital grant given to agriculture,and that to give the same rate of grant to agriculture as is given to industry,making account of the differences in tax arrangements, would imply an averageate of 19 per cent in less favoured areas and 4 per cent in the rest of thecountry.    These figures may be compared with the rates of 40-50 per cent iness favoured areas and 30-40 per cent in the rest of the country which havebeen proposed by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.BE CASE FOE DIFFERENTIAL SUPPORT TO AGRICULTURE26.   Before dealing with the immediate issues we address ourselves to thefundamental reasons for supporting British agriculture.    The classic argumentfor price stabilisation is that otherwise the uncertainty produced by fluc-tuations in returns, as a result of the weather combined with the inelasticityof demand, would lead to a lower level of output at a given average price.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThis argument is generally accepted as are considerations of rural poverty anJsecurity of supply.    In practice all developed countries given their agriculturalindustries some measure of support.27.    As members of the EEC, we have to operate within the framework of the CAElwhich commits us to support our agriculture (see paragraphs 14-16 above). Butthat framework leaves the United Kingdom some scope for national decisions -on the green  , retail milk prices, help for investment, hill subsidies, andthe remaining national commodity guarantees.    The practical question thereforeis not whether agriculture should be supported at all, but how far the nationsmeasures should be used to add to or subtract from the support inherent in the CAP,relal28. Some Departments believe that the size of British agriculture should bemainly determined by competition with imports at the prices at which the CAPpermits them to enter.    These prices (though excessively high and the cause oJsurplus EEC production) are the ones which determine whether or not it iseconomically worthwhile to devote extra United Kingdom resources to obtainingextra output.    They therefore consider that when the green   is aligned tothe market rate, the Government should withdraw from subsidising or supportingagriculture (except for regional aid) other than through the CAP.    It shouldthen be ready to look upon fluctuations in agricultural profitability as signalswhich enable agriculture to adjust to. its market (as in other industries) ratlthan as deviations requiring offsetting official action.29. The Agriculture Departments believe that British agriculture should asfar as possible be enabled to compete on level terms with its competitors inother member countries, which at present enjoy higher levels both of pricesupport and of national aids;    and that the British economy generally willbenefit from giving more support to agriculture, whose relative efficiency anc^responsiveness to incentive assure a larger consequential increase in grossnational product.    They draw attention to the statement in the ConservativeManifesto that &quot;Labour have seriously undermined the profitability of these[our agricultural and food] industries&quot; and that &quot;we must ensure that theseindustries have the means to keep abreast of those in other countries&quot;.30. The Government has helped one relatively small but, in social and regionsterms, important part of the industry by its decision to increase the hilllivestock allowances for 1980 by about one-third at a cost of  21 million.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe three decisions which need to he taken next (set out in paragraph 3 above)all affect either major sections or the whole of the industry.31. Any of the measures recommended in paragraph 3 would represent a transferof resources to agriculture from the rest of the economy.    The AgricultureDepartments consider that the whole of the transfer would be justified.Implementation of these measures would still leave net farm income in 1980below that in 1979 in real terms.    Other Departments have expressed doubtswhether all these measures are justified.32. It is common ground that:    if EEC support prices are frozen and noaction is taken domestically, farming net income in 1980, like profitabilityin British industry at large, will he significantly down on the 1979 level,tfhich itself is down in real terms from the levels of the mid-1970s. TheAgriculture Departments argue that something ought to be done to lessen thedecline.    They further argue that a decline in incomes must eventually lead,through lack of investment, to a loss of future production and employment.53.    Taking the economy as a whole, a loss of agricultural production wouldlot matter if the resources displaced from agriculture were put to at leastjqually valuable use elsewhere in the economy.    But the Agriculture Departmentargue that this will not happen, for three reasons -i. they argue that agricultural resources are relatively difficult totransfer to other uses.    This is obviously true of land, but lessobvious as regards labour where there has already been a steady driftaway from the land over many decades.    On the other hand, an inten-sification of this drift could be severely damaging to rural communities.ii. they argue that agriculture is relatively efficient atusing investment.    The key figures are that inagriculture, since 1970, the value of the capital goods used by theindustry has increased by 29 per cent in real terms, the labour forcehas declined by 10 per cent, and net product has increased by 21 percent.    The figures for manufacturing industry from 1970 to 1978 arean increase in capital stock of 23 per cent, a decline in the labourforce of 12 per cent, and an increase in volume of gross product11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALof 52&quot; Per cent. On the other hand, it has been argued that the 1970swere not a typical period given that production was stimulated by -transition to EEC price levels. Figures for the period 1958-78 suggestthat the relationship between investment and output is broadly the samefor agricultural and for manufacturing industry even though the figuresfor manufacturing industry include the effect of the decline of severaltraditional industries.iii. Agriculture imports a relatively small proportion of its inputs.Loss of food production will be replaced by imports of food. TheAgriculture Departments argue that manufacturing industry is not likelyto compete as successfully as agriculture, with imports, so that the neteffect is likely to be a loss of production and a continuing cost to thebalance of payments.    Other Departments dispute whether this is anoverriding consideration during a decade in which North Sea oil will bereducing our import bill to such an extent that sterling is likely toremain strong despite the recent abolition of exchange control.BACKGROUND TO THE IMMEDIATE ISSUESPossible developments in the CAP34. This report is not concerned with the need to reform the CAP to cutsurpluses and reduce the burden which falls on the United Kingdom. Thepossible pattern of developments has, however, to be taken into accountbecause of the implications for our farmers.35. The United Kingdom&apos;s first aim will continue to be to hold down the reallevel of EEC price support.    There is no question that this is the rightobjective f or the United Kingdom but in assessing the implications for ourdomestic agricultural policy we have to bear in mind that most of the scopefor green   devaluations has already been used up and we can no longer assumethat restraint of common prices will leave our producers unaffected.36. However, while a prudent price policy for all CAP commodities should beour objective over the next few years, it might not, even if agreed in theAgriculture Council, be sufficient by itself to contain the cost of the CAP.For example an assessment of the position on milk, which accounts for 40 percent of the cost of the CAP, suggests that after a four-year price freeze12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfollowed by a period in which the price is held steady in real terms, milkproduction in the EEC as a whole might not, by the middle of the next decade,be significantly different from production in 1979.    Accordingly it is to beexpected that non-price measures to reduce the cost of the CAP,  such as theincrease in the co-responsibility levy on milk and the reductions in the quotasfor sugar which the Commission have recently proposed, will become moreimportant.    It is not possible to forecast at this stage what may emerge butany measures that are agreed will have implications for United Kingdom producers37.    It may be argued that, if the CAP produces uneconomic surpluses, restraintin production is essential in all member states.    The view of the AgricultureDepartments is, however, that as the United Kingdom.remains a large net importerof temperate food, it is in our general interest to increase home production inthe context of general Community restraint.    It is also, they argue, in theCommunity interest to increase production in areas of greatest relativeefficiency which   for many commodities are in the United Kingdom. OtherDepartments doubt whether a policy of aiming at self-sufficiency in food,which may have made sense in the 1940s or in periods when we were attemptingto prop up sterling at an artificially high level, is appropriate in presentcircumstances.   Nor, they believe, would it be practical politics to expectother EEC countries to make a proportionately greater-reduction in theirproduction so as to accommodate both United Kingdom expansion and the diminution)f surpluses.)EVALUATION OF THE GREEN  ;8.    The Conservative Manifesto says that the Government will &quot;aim to devalue;he green   within the normal lifetime of a Parliament to a point which wouldenable our producers to compete on level terms with those in the rest of theCommunity&quot;.   Much has already been achieved, partly by two   devaluations ofthe green   since the Government came to office, and partly through the recentstrength of the   itself.    The gap between green rates and market rates iscurrently some 10 per cent.39.    If the green   is to be devalued further in the near future, it willprobably be desirable on tactical grounds to propose the devaluation at themeeting of the Agriculture Council on 10 December.   Any later proposal for adevaluation is likely to become entangled in the 1980 price-fixing negotiations.13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL40. The main options for a December devaluation are nil and 5 per cent. Asignificantly higher devaluation is unlikely to be negotiable because of therisk of creating positive MCAs.41. The effect of a green   devaluation of 5 per cent on 1980 calendar yearincome allowing for the Lagged effect on producer prices will be about  120m.By the end of 1980 retail food prices would on average be higher by almost1 per cent and the RPI by \ per cent.    The full effects of the devaluation wonot however be felt until 1981.    The full year benefit to farm incomes would Tjabout  175m (equivalent to only 2j per cent on the value of agricultural outpbecause less than half this output benefits from a green   change) and the otmain consequences would be as follows -TABLE 3FULL YEAR EFFECTS OF 5 PER CENT DEVALUATION OF THE GREEN  Producersreturns(net offeed) mChange inconsumers1expenditure mFPIRPIPSEReffect mForeignexchangecostseffect mM-Public% Green  change(ie 4-5.supportprices)h on* 177*253+.95/0+. 25$-28H-86-2(a) Net effect of a reduction in expenditure and increase in receipts.(b) An increase in foreign exchange costs due mainly to a rise in foodimport prices.

CONFIDENTIALLIQUID MILK DISTRIBUTION AND THE RETAIL PRICE OF MILK42. The United Kingdom&apos;s system of liquid milk distribution is unique inEurope.    Its main features are as follows -i. Farmers sell all their milk to their local Milk Marketing Board (MMB).They receive a &quot;pool&quot; price reflecting the Board&apos;s total return fromthe liquid and manufacturing markets.ii. The Boards sell milk for manufacturing (into butter, cheese, etc)and for liquid consumption.    The price of milk for liquid consumptionis 25 per cent - l^p per pint - higher than that for milk formanufacturing.    This difference is the &quot;liquid milk premium&quot;.iii. The Government sets both the maximum retail price of milk andthe various wholesale prices payable to the MMBs for liquid milk, thedifference between the two being the distributors&apos; margin.iv. The wholesale purchasers of milk for liquid consumption are thelarge dairies which operate the United Kingdom&apos;s system of door-to-doormilk deliveries.    These&apos;dairies also sell to retail outlets includingsupermarkets, but the price of milk in supermarkets is generally thesame as that of milk delivered to the door.43. It has been suggested that the retail price of milk could be reducedia two ways.44. First, it is argued that the wholesale price should be set so as toreduce or eliminate the liquid milk premium.    This would be in.accordancewith the criterion for agricultural support suggested in paragraph 28 above.Whether the premium could he completely eliminated is not clear: on theContinent, the producer typically sells to a producer co-operative, whichin turn sells milk into manufacturing and liquid consumption at differentprices, but the premium is not as great as in the United Kingdom.15CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL45. Secondly, it is argued that the retail price of milk is kept artificially!high by the dairies in the interests of protecting their door-to-doordeliveries.    One estimate is that of the current price of 15p per pint, 5p is Iaccounted for by distribution costs.    The Department of Trade estimates thatin conditions of free competition the supermarkets might save 3p of this,but the Agriculture Departments consider this estimate highly optimistic.The supermarket chains certainly claim that the dairies charge them higherprices than they would in a fully competitive situation. It is argued thatfreer competition between shop and doorstep sales in England and Wales, asalready occurs in Scotland and the Irish Republic, would provide a beneficialspur to both, and could make it unnecessary for the Government to set (and inltimes of inflation continually increase) the maximum retail price. Thedairies&quot; present trading practices are being examined by the Office of FairTrading.46. Against this, the Agricultural Departments argue that the supermarketsare free to negotiate with the dairies, and, if they dislike the dairies&apos;prices, are also free to set up their own bottling plants which would enablethem to buy milk direct from the MMBs.    It would therefore be possible forcompetition to exist at any level of intensity between retail shops anddairies under the present system.   It might well be that Government controlof the retail price has- prevented the dairies from abusing the presentposition and has depressed prices;    this may indeed have reduced the stimulus topotential competitors to enter the market.47. The main argument against change is the belief that lower shop priceswould kill off the doorstep delivery, with unacceptable social and economicconsequences.    The reason for this belief is that only a minority ofconsumers would need to switch from delivered milk to shop bought milk inorder for delivery rounds, with their high fixed costs, to become uneconomic.The evidence as to the viability of delivery rounds in these circumstancesis not conclusive.    The experience of Continental Europe, and of breaddeliveries in the United Kingdom, suggests that they would largely if notentirely disappear, but they have survived in Scotland despite a measure of16CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcompetition from milk in the shops.    Successive Governments have acceptedthe results of consumer choice in other fields, notably in the abolition ofresale price maintenance and the consequential growth in supermarkets atthe expense of small shops.   But it is argued that milk distribution isdifferent because the distribution system affects the volume of milk purchasedas well as the place of purchase; and that because, unlike most foodstuffs,milk is both bulky and highly perishable, a reduction in doorstep deliverywould almost certainly lead to a significant decline in the United Kingdom&apos;sconsumption of liquid milk, to the detriment of United Kingdom agriculture.48.   Another potential cause of change is the import   of liquid milk. Thereare at present no common EEC regulations governing the health and hygieneof the production, processing and packaging of milk so that Member Statesare free to maintain their own national measures.    The United Kingdom-egulations effectively prevent the import of pre-packed liquid milk intothis country. The Commission has challenged our legislation on the groundshat it is an unfair restriction on intra-Community trade.    It is likelyhat the issue will be referred to the European Court in the first half of980, but it is by no means certain that the United Kingdom will lose thei ase.    If we were to lose it, we would probably be forced to permit importsof liquid milk by the end of 1980.    If we won it, the eventualKarmonisation of national health and hygiene regulations by the EECv/ould probably result in imports taking place early in 1982.9.   As already indicated in paragraph 45, the dairies&apos; trading practicestre being examined by the Office   of Fair Trading.    In addition the Ministrycf Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has commissioned a study by accountantsof distributors1 margins.    The result of both these investigations will becvailable in the New Year and will provide material for further considerationof the longer-term issues of milk distribution.    But they do not requireimmediate decisions.    The question now is whether the retail price of milkshould be raised by l^p a pint, as proposed by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food,    Since the main purpose   of this increase would be tohelp producers rather than distributors, the proceeds would be devoted largelyto an increase in the wholesale price of liquid milk.    It would thus have theeffect of increasing the liquid premium.17CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL50. Milk prices are normally reviewed each October and April. The previousGovernment postponed a decision in March 1979? and Ministers agreed to a1-Jp per pint increase in May. Almost the whole of this increase went tomaintain distributors&apos; margins. It was then hoped that the wholesaleprice could be increased in October sufficiently to give dairy farmers areasonable return for the Autumn without a further retail price increaseuntil the New Year.51. In the event, the measured costs of the distributors increased morethan had been expected and the wholesale price increase    in October was onlyhalf of what had been expected in May.    The Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food accordingly proposed an increase of l^p per pint on themaximum retail price of milk from 18 November in England, Wales andNorthern Ireland, and from 21 October in Scotland.    The Cabinet decided on4 October not to make any immediate increase in the retail price   of milk.52. The present position is that milk producers&apos; net income in 1980 willbe below the 1979 level in real terms unless two changes are made witheffect from   1 January 1980   - a 5 per cent devaluation of the green  , anda l^rp per pint increase on the maximum retail price of milk.53. Within the Community we shall be pressing for a price freeze on milkamd milk products and hence for a decline in the real incomes of milkproducers.    The question arises whether it is sensible at the same time tomaintain the real incomes of milk producers at home.    The AgricultureDepartments argue that it is, because our policy aim within the Communityis to cut milk production by squeezing out the least efficient producers.This would not be achieved by applying the full rigours of the price freezeto the United Kingdom, since, until inflation is brought under control, aprice freeze without other measures would have a disproportionate effect onUnited Kingdom milk producers who are more efficient than many others inthe Community.    Others argue that increasing the liquid premium runs the riskaf stimulating investment in the dairy industry which will prove to beuneconomic when, as is bound to be the case sooner or later, liquid milk importcan no longer be prevented and a high liquid premium no longer sustained. Thussetting the premium at an excessive level represents an unnecessary burden onconsumers and a wasteful use of resources.    They also argue that increased milk]production would lead to increased sales into intervention in the United Kingdoi18CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALFARM CAPITAL GRANTS54.    In order to complete this year&apos;s public expenditure review Ministershave now to decide the level of expenditure on farm capital grants in 1981-82and thereafter.   A result of the lags between application and payment isthat changes in expenditure in 1982-83 require rates of grant to be changedfrom 1 January 1980.    The &quot;base-line&quot; for capital grants is  160 millionin 1982-83.    The Treasury propose that, as a contribution to the widerpublic expenditure savings exercise, this figure should he reduced by 60 million.    Since some  50 million of the  160 million is already committeda cut of 55 per cent in the rates of grants would be needed. Alternativelythe cut in rates might be somewhat reduced either by progressively delayingpayments already contracted, or by taking some items out of grant altogether.In contrast to the Treasury proposal the MAFF propose that the grant shouldoe increased by  30 million in 1982-83, allowing an increase in coverage anda somewhat higher average level of grant.    This change would be accompaniedby the streamlining of the grants system recommended by Sir Derek Rayner.The gap between the MAFF and the Treasury is, therefore,  90 million. Thisis equivalent to some 10 per cent of annual gross  capital expenditure inagriculture.)5.   MAFF say that past experience indicates that Government support is neededo stimulate investment since farmers, like other small businesses, are:eluctant to incur long term debts.    They suggest that the figures showinghe relationship between past investment and increases in output (paragraph 58)(emonstrate that such assistance is well worth while from the national pointof view.    They beliwe that increased support is now necessary becausenvestment in buildings and works is lower than it was in 1970, and isprobably barely adequate to maintain the existing stock.    Indeed a recenttecline in applications for capital grants, reflecting waning agriculturalconfidence, suggests that there will be a sharp fall in investment if nofurther measures are taken.   A further reason to increase the level ofexpenditure is to fulfil, at least in part, the Governmenfs commitment tokeep our agriculture abreast of its much more heavily subsidised and price-advantaged competitirs in other EEC member countries.   MAFF calculate thatif expenditure on agricultural investment here was subsidised down to thesame level, the Exchequer cost would be double that of the current capitalgrants.19CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL56. The Treasury view is that the MAFF proposals are inconsistent with theagreement already reached in Cabinet on the levels of public expenditurefor 1980-81.   Moreover they do not consider that they provide a basis forexempting agriculture from contributing to the overall reductions in expendituito which the Government is committed in later years.    The Cabinet has, forexample, already agreed to reductions in the inherited industrial supportprogramme rising by 1983 to more than  400 million (over 40 per cent) ofwhich about half reflects the announced reduction in the coverage and ratesof regional development grant.57. The Treasury believe that, while in certain disadvantaged areas aidsfor agriculture can be justified in social terms, general aids should beconsidered on their economic merits.    They do not believe that MAFF havedemonstrated that investment in agriculture is more likely to promoteoutput than would reductions in taxation.    They argue that investment whichneeds the assistance of higher levels of grant is by definition marginaland that marginal investment could not be justified even if on averageagricultural investment were more productive than investment elsewhere in theeconomy.   Neither do they believe that expenditure can be justified bycomparisons with the incentives available in other, mostly richer, EECmember states.    Such aids are given for a variety of reasons, includingsocial reasons, which are not applicable to the United Kingdom.   In any case,as regards new investment, each member state&apos;s agricultural industry iscompeting for resources primarily against other sectors of its own economyrather than against agriculture in other member states.is a58.    One reason for the difference in approach between the Treasury and MAPF is adifferent view of the effect that changes in expenditure on investment grants mighthave.    If we take the case of a  60 million cut, then MAFF believe that investmentwould fall by at least the full volume of the cut; the net stock of capitalwould therefore be lower by nearly  300 million after five years. Thiswould probably result in a reduction of  100 million in gross product, a 150 million reduction in   utput, and an increase in imports of food(net of savings on imported inputs) of about  140 million per annum. They20CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsuggest that the effectiveness of investment grants in stimulating investmentis demonstrated hy the (time-lagged) changes in investment volume followingrecent changes in the rates of grant.    Investment rose by 22 per cent between1969 and 1973? following a 15-point increase in grant rates in 1970; fellby 36 per cent to 1976 after a reduction in rates in 1972-73;    and recoveredby 33 per cent in 1979 following increases in rates in 1976.59.    The Treasury on the other hand believe that fluctuations in investmenthave been due to changes in farmers1 profits and prospects, and to short runchanges in investment plans due to anticipation of changes in rates, and thatthe long run association between grant rates and investment is weak.    They alsodoubt the simple causal relationship which is assumed between the level ofcapital stock and the level of output.    Finally, they point out that, althoughfood imports might be reduced if expenditure on farm capital grants led toextra agricultural production much of the expenditure would in fact lead toadditional purchasing power by farmers and contractors, some of which wouldstimulate other imports.    In these cases the grant represents a bonus whichis available to the farmer for other spending.   MAFF&apos;s answer to these pointsis that, whatever the^possibilities for individual farmers, they expect theoverall effect on expenditure on investment to be at least equal to the changein expenditure on grant.)0.     Changes in expenditure in 1982-83 would be achieved by changes in the rate)f grant.    Because commitments to pay grant undertaken in any one year influencethe pattern of expenditure on farm capital grants for several years ahead, itrould be necessary to reduce grant rates from 1 January 1980 in order to achievea lower target level of expenditure in 1982-83.    We give below some examples*f possible reductions.TABLE 41980-81      1981-82      1982-83 1983-84Saving of  60m in 1982-83deduction in rate of grant needed to achieve saving - 55 per centsavings    m 25 47 60 7250fo Reduction in Grant RatesSavings    m 21 42 55 65k0% Reduction in Grant RatesSavings    m Jtg&quot; 34 44 5230% Reduction in Grant RatesSavings    m 13 25 33 39_21_CONFIDENTIAL
