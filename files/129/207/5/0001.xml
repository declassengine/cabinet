SECRETDOCUMENT.IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 35 COpY NQ7 September 1979CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:PROPOSALS FOR THE. YEARS AFTER 1980-81Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. We have decided on public expenditure plans for 1980-81:  we nowhave to decide how to carry through those plans for the years up to 1983-84.2. Annex A of this paper shows proposed totals for each Department.The detailed proposals in Annex B illustrate possible ways of achievingthese totals.    They are not intended to foreclose any other options whichthe Minister concerned may want to keep open at this stage.    Annex Csummarises the results for total public expenditure.3. We shall also be discussing a paper on publication of our plans(C(79) 36), a paper on the financing of the nationalised industries (C(79) 37)and the Lord Presidents paper on his review of Civil Service staff costs(C(79) 38).ECONOMIC BACKGROUND4. Our key objectives are to reduce inflation by firm control ofmonetary growth, to roll back the boundaries of the public sector and toreduce income tax.    We have to pursue these objectives in difficultcircumstances.    The world economic climate is depressed, and likely toremain so for some time.    At home, inflation has acquired a considerablemomentum.    Productivity is low.    Trading performance and Indus try&apos;scompetitiveness in international markets are weak.    Reflecting theseadverse developments, industrial profitability is low and investment likelyto be weak.5. The Labour Governments expenditure plans bore no relation to therealities of the economic prospect.    They would have been unsustainable,like earlier plans.    But their announcement has raised expectations thatmake it harder to bring expenditure back to its levels in the recent past.It is, however, essential to do this if intolerable burdens are not to beimposed on the private sector.1SECRET
SECRET6. Though it is reasonable to hope that our economic policies will bearfruit in time, we cannot confidently take credit now for any significantgrowth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the next few years. So,even with the rising receipts from the North Sea, there will be little, if any,increase in real terms in total Government revenue at unchanged tax rates.The possibility of raising petroleum revenue tax in the light of higher oilprices is being examined, but the amount of additional revenue that it wouldproduce, though welcome, would not make a major difference to the publicsector borrowing requirement over the next few years.7. Even with the expenditure levels proposed in this paper it will be hardto hold the borrowing requirement to around its present proportion of GDPwithout some real increase in taxation.    We are committed to a substantialreduction in income tax, and there is little scope for raising indirect taxeswithout a significant impact on prices.    If we do not limit the public sector&apos;sdemand for finance it will probably be impossible to avoid higher interestrates - which would not only be very unpopular with mortgagors but wouldadd to industry1 s financing problems.8. .       The conclusion is inescapable.    Given the difficult prospect for theeconomy in the next few years, it is only through substantial reductions inthe inherited expenditure plans for the years after 1980-81 that we shall beable to implement our policies for the money supply and taxation - whichform the core of our economic strategy.    Our ability   to face up to thisif sue will be seen as a crucial test of our determination to stick to ourannounced policies, and will thus play a vital part in affecting expectations.9. The reductions proposed in this paper are the very minimum thatwould be compatible with our objectives for bringing down inflation andreducing the tax burden.CONSEQUENCES FOR INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMES10. Between 1970-71 and our agreed 1980-81 plans, public expenditurewill have risen by almost one-third (in volume terms),    This is twice asmuch as the likely growth in GDP during the same 10 years, and is equivalentto some  16 billion at 1979 Survey prices.    Of that  16 billion, some 13^ billion - or about four-fifths - is accounted for by five items: socialsecurity ( 7 billion), health and personal social services ( 2 billion),housing (current) ( 2 billion), education ( l  billion) and the EEC ( 1 billion).Social security   is now a quarter of the total;  defence, health and educationeach constitute around 12 per cent;  housing is about 7 per cent of the total.H.       We have to stop public expenditure growing.    The total in 1978-79,the last full year of the previous Government, was too high.    Even to keepthe total stable over the period ahead, some programmes need to be reduced.That is because we are giving priority to defence and law and order, andallowing those programmes to grow significantly over the period, by around16 per cent and 13 per cent respectively from 1978-79 to 1983-84.    We arealso allowing the health programme to grow, and the social securityprogramme cannot be reduced much.    Nor can any precise assumption bemade about the effect of our renegotiation of our contribution to the EEC,which will otherwise continue to grow rapidly.SECRET
SECRET12. As a result of the increases in the above programmes, virtually allthe remaining programmes heed to fall over the period ahead.    The biggestabsolute reductions are proposed in housing and education, but otherprogrammes, though smaller, also have to contribute to the adjustment.13. The level of expenditure proposed for each Department is shown inAnnex A.    What this could mean in detail, in terms of changes from theplans in the last White Paper, is shown in Annex B.14. Comments follow on the largest programmes.    The overall pictureis considered in paragraphs 36-37.I - PRIORITY PROGRAMMESDefence15. The proposals are designed to allow for 3 per cent per annum growthin cost terms from 1980-31 onwards, implying a figure in 1983-84 nearly 1.2 billion higher than in 1978-79.     This would compare very favourablywith the performance of most other countries to date in relation to the NATOtarget.    Even these figure? should, however, be regarded as provisionalpending further consideration of the requirements for United Kingdomdefence expenditure.Law and Order16. The proposals are designed to carry out the undertakings we gave inthe Manifesto and The Queen&apos;s Speech to ensure that the law is enforcedmore effectively.    They provide for a rise of one-eighth in the Home Officeprogramme from 1978-79 to 1983-84.    The main increases are for thepolice and supporting services;  they allow for the continued expansion ofpolice numbers up to authorised establishments.    There should also be smallincreases in the court, prison, probation and immigration services.Expenditure on community services, including those for ethnic minorities,should ho-vever remain at its existing level.II - PROGRAMMES DIFFICULT TO REDUCESocial Security17. This programme grew by one quarter during the previousAdministration, as a result largely of increased numbers and extension ofeligibility, and the policy of uprating long-term benefits by the greater ofearnings or prices, so that benefit levels improved in real terms.    We mustrein back the growth in this programme.    We have already decided thatupratings (of all benefits) need give protection against price increases only.The further measures now proposed include abolition of the earnings-related supplement (which we rejected earlier this year but might now bepursued for later years), and the introduction of a compulsory employers&apos;sick pay scheme so as to secure substantial savings of sickness benefitpayments.    The figures consequently show a slight fall in the total3SECRET
SECRETprogramme between 1980-81 and 1983-84.    However, this is beforemaking provision for any improvement in the cash value of child benefit(this has been taken into account in the proposals below for the contingencyreserve).    The proposals also do not allow for the possibility that unemploy-ment (and hence expenditure on unemployment benefit) may turn out to belarger than so far assumed in the programme figures.Even with the changes proposed, this programme will continue to be far thelargest, and to take a very substantial slice of our available resources.Health18. The proposals are in accordance with our Manifesto commitment notto reduce gross spending by the National Health Service (NHS).    The pressurefor further increases, particularly in 1983-84, to meet demographic andother changes should be met in three ways: by the steps being taken toeliminate waste and improve efficiency which wi21 make the availableresources go further;  by the encouragement of private practice which willrelieve some of the pressures on the NHS;  and by increased charges (andpossibly reducing the scope of the present exemptions).EEC Contributions (including the Intervention Board for AgriculturalProducts)19. The figures shown are realistic estimates of the cost of our contri-bution to the EEC calculated on the present basis.    By 1983-84 they amountto  2,028 million, which is higher by  722 million than provided for in thelast plans published by the previous Government.    It would be imprudent totake credit for a particular reduction before it has been achieved by re-negotiation.    We should however regard the figures as particularlyprovisional and aim to reduce them substantially.    They demonstrate howvital it is to succeed in renegotiating the basis of our contribution.Ill - PROGRAMMES BEARING THE BURDEN OF ADJUSTMENTHousing20. We inherited plans to spend almost  5^ billion a year on housing by1982-83, nearly half of it on subsidies.    It is imperative to reduce theburden of such subsidies.    Rents will need to increase faster than the rate ofgrowth of earnings.    The proposal is that in each year from 1981-82, whenthe new housing subsidy system is in place, rents should rise by  1. 50 aweek in real terms more than the percentage growth in earnings.21. We shall need to place greater reliance on the private sector bothfor investment and finance.    The Secretary of State for the Environmentsproposals for council house sales and savings on municipalisation arewelcome.    As for new building, a public sector programme (local authorities,new towns and housing associations) of 50-60, 000 houses a year will beadequate to meet those needs for which the private sector may not provide.Within that total, local authorities are assumed to build 40, 000 houses ayear, little less than their current annual rate of tender approvals.4SECRET
SECRETEducation22. The proposals envisage a decrease of 10 per cent in expenditure oneducation and science from 1978-79 to 1983-84.    During that time thenumber of primary and secondary pupils is expected to fall by 13 per centwhile the number of home students in higher education might, if unrestricted,rise by 11 per cent.    The main effect of the proposals would be to halveexpenditure on school meals and milk, to stabilise other school expenditureper pupil and to hold the number of home students in higher education at orjust below the 1978-79 level.     There are no proposals to increase theparental contribution to student grants or to reduce the present level ofnursery education.Roads and Transport23. The proposals envisage a decrease of 15 per cent in eapenditure onroads and transport between 1978-79 and 1983-84 but still leave a substantialprogramme (over  2 billion a year).    Expenditure on motorways and trunkroads (which was cut back by the last Administration) could continue at thesame level as in 1978-79.    The main decreases would occur on local roadand transport projects and on revenue subsidies but it is in keeping withour policies that, over time, more of the cost of public transport should beborne by the user and less by the taxpayer or ratepayer.Department of the Environment - Other Environmental Services24. The proposals take credit for the decision to abolish the CommunityLand Scheme.    They maintain investment by the Regional WaterAuthorities at its 1978-79 level.    The proposed provision for currentexpenditure on local environmental services takes account of the announcedintention to legislate to allow local authorities to charge for planningpermissions and for the enforcement of building regulations.Employment25. The proposals would produce a level of expenditure on employmentand training of only a shade under  1, 000 million a year by 1982-83, whichwould still be more than twice the level of five years ago.    They make noprovision for continuing the Departments temporary employment measures(the present programme is due to close for applications in March 1980).Programmes operated by the Manpower Service Commission (whichincludes the Youth Opportunities programme) would level off after the rapidexpansion of recent years.    No provision is made for a permanent short-time working scheme.Industry2o.       The proposals for the most part flow directly from the majordecisions already agreed and announced, in fulfilment of the Manifesto, toreduce expenditure on selective industrial assistance and the activities ofthe National Enterprise Board, and on regional development grant. Furthersavings will however be needed to maintain the additional 3 per cent cutagreed for 1980-81.5SECRET
SECRETOverseas Services - Foreign and Con.monwealth Office27.      Overseas aid should no longer be regarded as sacrosanct. Theproposed reductions would bring expenditure  70 million (L per cent) belowthe 1978-79 level by 1982-83;  it would not however go below 1977-78.Pending decisions on the general review of Civil Service staff costs, thesavings indicated for the diplomatic service are simply a continuation ofthose agreed for 1980-81.    The reductions shown for the British Councilare subject to the outcome of the review of the British Council&apos;s activities.Personal Social Services28.      The proposals would restrict spending on personal social servicesby 1983-84 to about 9 per cent below the 1978-79 level.    This would meansome cutback? in service, but, in spite of the demographic pressures, theeffect should be mitigated by our policy of helping people to help themselvesand of encouraging the voluntary sector to play a major role in partnershipwith local authorities.Agriculture29.      Domestic agricultural expenditure was not touched in the Budget andthe farming community has had the benefit of two substantial devaluationsthis year in the green pound.    Reduced expenditure totals in 1980-81 wereagreed in July but the policy decisions needed to confine expenditure withinthem were left for discussion between agricultural Ministers.    For futureyears reducing capital grants seems to offer the most practicable means ofachieving the necessary level of savings and the proposals reflect this.Arts and Librarie s30. The proposals will mean some reduction by 1983-84 as compared with1978-79.    So far as libraries go, this could be met in part by postponing orcancelling the controversial new British Library building, while the effectson the arU programme (which has shown substantial growth over the pastfew years) should be mitigated by increased private contributions due in partto our policy of reducing personal taxation.    Provision is made for theproposed new Heritage Fund.Other31. Most of the remaining Departments - Trade, Energy, PropertyServices Agency, Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office, Central Office ofInformation, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland - will also have to share in theadjustment, as shown in Annex A.    (The changes proposed for Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland are generally proportionate to the changes inother programmes.    They are provisional and will need to be adjusted instep with our decision on other programmes. )6SECRET
SECRETContingency Reserve32.       There are bound to be some further requirements which we willneed to meet, some of them not within our control.    For example, thepresent programmec make no provision for increases in the cash value ofchild benefit during the Survey period, or in social security payments ifunemployment turns out higher than assumed.    Even so, we can and shouldmake cuts in the inherited contingency reserve, to tighten discipline heretoo.    The cuts shown in the summary table in Annex C would reduce thecontingency reserve to:-1981-82 1982-83 1983-84 million 1500 2000 2500These levels are aeeded in order to retain a modest degree of flexibilityin a period far ahead.Civil Service Manpower33.      Where our decisions on 1980-81 included savings in Civil Servicestaff, the proposals in Annex A assume that these are projected forwardto the later years of the Survey period;  but they do not take credit forfurther decisions on staff savings to be taken in the context of theLord President of the Council&apos;s proposals.    Some broad allowance ishowever made for further savings on this account in the summary figuresin Annex C.Local Authorities34. The proposals imply percentage reductions in the totals of localauthority current and capital spending (England and Wales), by comparisonwith 1978-79, as follows:-1980-81 1981-82 1982-83 1983-84%, % % %Current Z\ 5 8 7Capital 15^ 24 29 31Total 5i 9 12i 12i35. We have already entered discussions with the local authorityAssociations about the likely pattern of their current spending within therevised total for 1980-81, and we shall be able to take account of theirviews in our published plans.    But we have no time for similar detaileddiscussions about the figures for the later years if these too are to bepublished before Christmas.    In any case the Associations would probablybe unable to add significantly at this stage to their comments.    Once wehave published our plans for the later years, these will be the basis forfull discussion with the Associations next year, as part of the normal annualcycle for reviewing their expenditure.7SECRET
SECRET36. We could however indicate to the local authority Associations, inthe next few weeks, the broad magnitude of the further reductions in theircurrent spending which we have in mind to publish towards the end of theyear.    It would be somewhat artificial to give figures covering the threeyear period to 1983-84 without including capital expenditure.    But capitalexpenditure can only be discussed sensibly on the basis of detailed servicefigures, and, as a starting point, we would need to give the Associationsour revised plans for 1980-81.    Anything we said to the Associationswould probably become public.    (The arguments concerning publicationare discussed in C(79) 36.)The Overall Picture37. The table at Annex C shows that, if the proposed reductions weremade in full, they would bring the planning total (excluding debt interest)in volume terms back close to the 1977-78 level by 1982-83 and well belowthe last inherited level in 1978-79, in volume terms.    (The 1977-78 and1978-79 figures have been adjusted both to remove the sale of BritishPetroleum shares in 1977-78 and by adding in that part of family supportwhich in 1977-78 and 1978-79 was met by child tax allowances and is nowprovided by child benefit.)38. These proposals mean that total public expenditure will decline, ovethe quinquennium under consideration, by about j per cent per annum (onaverage, comparing 1983-84 with 1978-79).    Over the quinquennium forwhich the last Government were responsible, total public expenditure roseby about 1 per cent per annum (comparing 1978-79 with 1973-74). Whatis proposed cannot therefore be described as tearing up the public sectorby the roots.   But it does represent a deliberate and necessary pruning ofthe demands which it makes on the economy and the taxpayer.CONCLUSION39. The Cabinet are invited:-i.       to consider the proposals in Annex A for provisional figureswithin which each Department should plan expenditure for theyears 1981-82 to 1983-84, and to agree that the Chief Secretary,Treasury should undertake bilateral discussions with thoseMinisters who require them, reporting back to Cabinet on18 October;ii.       to decide whether in the meantime the local authorityAssociations should be given an opportunity to express a viewon the proposals affecting them, on the lines indicated inparagraph 35.G HJ BTreasury Chambers7 September 1979SECRET
