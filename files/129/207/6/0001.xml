CONFIDENTIALInOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER 2RITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT81C(79) 36 COPY NO7 September 1979CABINETPUBLISHING MEDIUM-TERM PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PLANSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. The Cabinet on 26 July (CC(79) 12th Conclusions, Minute 5) askedme to prepare a paper about the case for and against publishing plans forthe later years of the Public Expenditure Survey.    This was intended asbackground to our discussion of the proposals for those years circulated inC(79) 35.MEDIUM-TERM PLANNING2. A prior question is whether we should in fact make plans for themedium term.    I assume it is agreed that we should.    For manyexpenditure programmes, the money can only be spent efficiently if plannedseveral years ahead.    The spending authorities need at least a provisionalframework if they are to use the money to the best advantage - for example,in getting a proper balance between capital and current spending.3. But for this purpose it is essential that the plans are realistic.The lesson of experience since the Plowden Report is the folly of agreeingambitious expenditure programmes on the basis of too rosy a view of thefuture.    vVe must not make the same mistake this time.    Public spendingplans for future years must be genuinely contingent on success in our maineconomic and financial policies.    We should not now make firm commit-ments to figures for later years which could well have to be revised down-wards in subsequent surveys if the progress achieved by the economy doesnot justify the expenditure.    For the present, figures for the more distantfuture should be regarded only as a provisional basis for planning.4-        The period covered by the annual surveys needs to be long enough toprovide a helpful guide for managers of the long-lead programmes, but nottoo long to be covered by some broad economic and financial framework.At present it is the current year plus four years ahead, though if we werestarting from scratch, we might have adopted a slightly shorter period.Other comparable countries which publish expenditure projections seem touse a period broadly similar to ours.    For the reasons in paragraph 8below, I do not think that we should shorten the period now.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPUBLICATION5. The question which the Cabinet raised was whether the plans, oncedecided, should be published.6. There are arguments against this.    The Plowden Committee, whichrecommended the development of the survey system, in fact assumed thatGovernments would not be prepared to publish them.    The publication ofplans for increased spending on particular programmes can raise publicexpectations about the development of the services.    This stimulatespressure for still further improvements, and complaints if the plans haveto be revised later on.    The curtailment of planned increases tends toappear in the public mind as &quot;cuts&quot;, and to be criticised accordingly.7. Partly because of the tendency to base plans on over-optimisticassumptions, there have in practice been many revisions in these plansbetween their first publication and their eventual implementation.    It can beargued that it is not worth publishing figures which are going to be revisedso many times before they reach finality.8. There are however strong arguments in favour of publication.First, to succeed in our economic and financial strategy we must convincepeople not only that we have the determination to carry it through but alsothat we will pursue the policies on which it depends.    Our pledge to reducethe demands which the public sector places on the economy is fundamentalto both.    Publication of forward spending plans has become so much anestablished practice that to stop doing so now would probably be interpretedas a weakening of commitment to our strategy, an admission that we doubtwhether it is attainable, or both.    Particularly at the start of ourAdministration we need to show to the world at large that our plans forpublic spending are much lower than our predecessors&apos; and how thisrestraint in our plans supports our wider economic objectives.    We can onlydemonstrate these points by publishing at least the broad lines of those plansfor the later years.9-        We also need to give guidance to public bodies outside CentralGovernment.    This means that part of the plans must be divulged in anycase and become public knowledge.    The local authority associations, forexample, have said that their approach to the reductions required in 1980-81will depend on whether these are part of a continuing and progressive policy.The nationalised industries will expect a similar indication as a basis fortheir investment decisions.    Such forward indications, if they are to begiven with confidence as a basis for planning, need to be part of a coherentframework, within an expenditure total which is consistent with theGovernment1 s medium-term financial objectives and the prospects for theUnited Kingdom and world economy.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL10. Finally, to do a survey and then refuse to publish the result wouldrun counter to what we are saying and doing about open government.Parliamentarians would say it was extraordinary to set up newCommittees to help the House to scrutinise Departments&apos; plans betterand then for us to provide less information than our predecessors aboutour intentions for the future.11. Thus, although there are some powerful arguments againstpublishing the plans for the later years, I think that the arguments forcontinued publication are weightier.    This makes it all the more importantthat we should keep our planned expenditure low.    We need also to say,even more clearly than in previous White Papers, that the plans for thelater years are provisional, and the Government is not and cannot becommitted to all the detailed projections for individual programmes.12. To underline this, we could publish the figures for the later yearsas provisional totals with a minimum of supporting detail consistent withgiviag appropriate guidance to authorities responsible for programmes withlong lead times.    But we should not regard this as grounds for deferringthe necessary decisions about reductions in the totals.    Unlike the LabourGovernment, following the International Monetary Fund visit in the autumnof 1976, we cannot plead that there has been insufficient time to completethe survey, and publishing - even provisionally - higher figures than wouldbe consistent with our general objectives would be interpreted as a failureto agree on the necessary reductions and a weakening of our resolve toreduce public expenditure.LOCAL AUTHORITIES13. A related question is the degree to which we publish theprogramme detail of the proposed figures for local authority currentexpenditure, both for 1980-81 and for the later years.    This question, as itrelates to 1980-81, has been the subject of correspondence between theChief Secretary, Treasury, and the Ministers concerned, and differingviews have been expressed.14. V/e have asked the local authority associations to give us theirviews on the likely allocation of the 5 per cent reduction in the inheritedplans for local authority current expenditure in 1980-81 which we announcedin July, and we can if appropriate look again at the programme breakdownin the light of their comments.    But I think we should then publish ourviews on the programme allocation in the normal way.    In doing so, weshould recognise that the detailed figures are projections which are subjectto the freedom of individual local authorities to decide their own priorities.But I do rot think we can stand back entirely from the programmedistribution of local authority current expenditure.    National policies andpriorities are involved here, as we have already made clear, notably inrelation to law and order services.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL15. If our commitment to reduce the previous public expenditure plansis to carry conviction, the published figures will need to set out theimplications, as we see them, for the various functional expenditureprogrammes.    A complete presentation of this sort would not be possibleif the local authority current expenditure figures were confined to aseparate global total;  and leaving unallocated some or all of the localauthority reduction we have decided would look unconvincing.    If we did notpublish the programme figures, we could anyway expect questions to be putin Parliament to the individual Ministers, asking what they expect the totalto mean for their services, and it would be difficult to refuse thisinformation.    Similar considerations apply to the local authority figures forthe later years.CONCLUSIONS16. I invite the Cabinet to agree:i. Our decisions for 1980-81 (which we considered in July)should be published in a short White Paper as soon as possibleafter Parliament reassembles, along with the short-term forecastrequired under the Industry Act.ii. The plans for the subsequent three years should be publishedin a second White Paper, stressing their provisional nature andsetting them in a medium-term economic and financial context.The timing of this White Paper will depend on when we reachsubstantive decisions on the issues discussed in C(79) 35, but ifpossible should be before the end of the year.iii. In both these White Papers the figures for local authoritycurrent expenditure should be published by programme, as proposedin paragraph 14 above.G HTreasury Chambers7 September 1979CONFIDENTIAL
