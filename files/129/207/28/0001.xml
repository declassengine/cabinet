CONFIDENTIALHS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BBITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 5819 November 1979CABINETINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS LEGISLATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for EmploymentINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS LEGISLATION1. I set out below my legislative proposals on amendments to theemployment protection legislation, on the Society of Lithographic Artists,Designers, Engravers and Process Workers (SLADE), on the closed shopconscience clause and on the handling of general union immunities.2. The consultations on the employment protection proposals are notcompleted, but, if I am to introduce the Employment Bill as intended on6 December for Second Reading before the Recess, we must take decisionsnow.    We have sufficient knowledge of industry&apos;s views to do that.AMENDMENTS TO INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE RIGHTS3. The comments on these consultative proposals so far received fromthe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) informally and from some otheremployers&apos; associations, including those of small businesses, have beengenerally favourable.    Together with the two Orders now in operation whichincreased the qualifying period for applications for unfair dismissal andmodified the requirements in regard to consultation on redundancies, themeasures have been accepted as going a long way to meet the main concernsabout the employment protection legislation voiced by employers.4. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) have not yet been able to let mehave their views (their Employment Policy Committee meets on21 November). They have, however, been publicly hostile to the proposalswhich they represent as helping the bad employer and constituting a sell-outby the Government to the CEI.5. I now propose to go ahead with all the proposals on which I haveconsulted, subject to the case of the maternity provisions to:-COPY NO81CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALi. placing the obligation on the mother to provide the additionalnotification of intention to return to work only if the employer sorequests it and 9 weeks (not 6 weeks) after her confinement. Thesemodifications have been suggested by employers&apos; representatives.ii. Dropping the proposed exemption for firms with less than20 employees from the obligation to reinstate or re-engage themother if it is not reasonably practicable to do so.    This suggestionwas put forward in my working paper in a more tentative fashion andat the request of the Secretary of State for Industry.    It has evokedmore protest than any of the other proposals, and the criticism hascome from both sides of industry, and also from sections of our ownParty.    The main objection is that (unlike my other proposedexemption for small firms in the first two years of trading) it wouldcreate two classes of employee on a permanent basis.    From theemployer&apos;s point of view, the concession may prove in any event to beof limited value since the onus will be on him to show - if necessaryat a tribunal - that he qualified in all respects for the exemption.My legislative proposals are listed in the Annex.UNION RECOGNITION DISPUTES6. The Council of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service(ACAS) have made clear that they cannot satisfactorily operate the existingstatutory requirements for dealing with union recognition disputes(Sections 11-16 of the Employment Protection Act 1975).    The two practicablealternatives are either to repeal these requirements or substantially modifythem so as to try to make them workable.    The modifications required wouldbe to give ACAS greater discretion and/or greater powers.    I am notprepared to contemplate modification in the latter regard and I do not thinkthat the former would provide an effective procedure or solve ACAS1 problemsI therefore propose to repeal the statutory provisions which is the coursefavoured by the CBI.    The TUC will oppose this and will in addition arguethat legislation in this area now would be premature;  but I do not expectthem to come up with a generally acceptable alternative.STATUTORY EXTENSION OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT7. Most criticism of Schedule 11 of the Employment Protection Act 1975has centred on the provision which enables the &quot;general level&quot; of terms andconditions in the local trade or industry to be imposed on the employe?. .The CBI have urged repeal of this provision on the grounds that awards candisrupt company pay structures and damage industrial relations. Someemployers would like us to go further and repeal the whole Schedule,ie. including the first leg which enables industry-level agreements to beextended to other employers within the industry, and Part II which wasintended to provide additional protection in Wages Councils Industries butwhich has very rarely been used.    At present the CBI are divided on this.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL8. Repeal of the whole Schedule world be consistent with our belief thatemployers should be free to make their own agreements in the light of theirown circumstances.    On the other hand, it would maximise TUC oppositionand would upset some employer associations.    On balance, i am inclined torepeal the whole Schedule.9. Similar treatment of the Fair Wages Resolution (FWR) would belogical but would raise argument about the principle of fair competition forGovernment contracts.    As the CBI recognise, the scope for change isinhibited by International Labour Organisation Convention 94 which theUnited Kingdom has ratified.    We cannot in any event deal with the FWRin the Bill and I propose that we leave it for further consideration in the lightof debate on the Bill.SLADE10. I propose to afford a legal defence against SLADE-type recruitingactivities in the form of the proposal on which I consulted.    This will be byremoving immunity from civil action where industrial action is called orthreatened by persons not employed by the employer in dispute for thepurpose of coercing his employees into joining a particular trade union.A provision in these terms will focus on the offensive aspects of SLADE&apos;sbehaviour and should prove difficult for the TUC to attack convincingly.The CBI whom I have consulted informally support this proposal.TRADE UNION IMMUNITIES11. It has become clear that the CBI&apos;s own review will not be concludeduntil early next summer.    We shall then have to consider further legislationand the CBI have strongly advised that we should not deal with immunitiesgenerally in the present Bill.    However, the House of Lords now seem likelyto overturn the Court of Appeal in Express Newspapers v MacShane and inthe process overturn the view that the immunity for industrial action givenby Section U of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 (as amendedin 1976) probably did not go beyond the first customer, supplier and providerof services.    Preparatory work has been done on how to restore theposition, but it is a tricky business and we are already going to be very hardpressed to get the Bill ready for introduction by early December without thisadded complication.12. Much more important, however, is the delay in the Lords judgment.Judgment is now unlikely to be handed down until December and in my viewit would be quite wrong - and a very damaging tactical error - to undertakesuch an important change in immunities without first considering the Lordsjudgment carefully and giving ourselves the opportunity of consultation. Thisis an issue so sensitive that it would be folly to rush into legislation.    I havebeen making warning noises about a further measure and to leave the unionsuncertain of our proposals on this matter could act as a brake on theiractivities.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL13. I therefore intend to include in the Bill as introduced only thosechanges on immunities relating to picketing and to SLADE-type recruitmenttacticso    But on Second Reading I would say that we are reviewing the lawon immunities in the light of the Lords judgment and that, when we havereached a considered view, we will take whatever action seems necessaryto restore the position either by amendment to the Bill in Committee or in alater separate Bill.    This will give us a chance to get the provisions rightand to act with the advice and support of the CBI.    I shall put a furtherpaper to the Committee after I have fully reviewed the implications of theLords judgment.CLOSED SHOP - CONSCIENCE14. On the closed shop we have still to decide the precise scope of theprotection to be afforded to those with conscientious grounds against unionmembership in the closed shop situation.   On 18 October (CC(79) 17thConclusions, Minute 4) I was invited to consult with the Lord Chancellorand other interested Ministers and with the help of Parliamentary Counselto report back with revised proposals.    The Lord Chancellor and I havesince agreed on a statement of the objectives tc be covered by this provisionand I now submit for the agreement of colleagues Parliamentary Counsel&apos;spreferred formulation, namely &quot;on grounds of conscience&quot;.CLOSED SHOP - EXCLUSION OR EXPULSION FROM A TRADE UNION15. I earlier proposed that the right of appeal should be general. Butthe concern over the question of whom unions will or will not have inmembership is in fact concentrated on the circumstances of the closed shop.There is much less justification for examining their internal procedures inthis respect where people&apos;s jobs are not at stake, little merit in exposingthe courts to unnecessary interference in union affairs, and some risk toparticipation by employee representatives in industrial tribunals. Iconseqently propose on further consideration, that the provision for a rightof appeal for those excluded or expelled from union membership should belimited to the circumstances of the closed shop, as originally proposed inthe Manifesto.CONCLUSIONS16. I seek my colleagues&apos; agreement to the inclusion in the Bill (inaddition to the provisions we have already agreed on picketing, the closedshop and public funds for union ballots) of the following provisions:-a. The amendments to the employment protection Acts andother measures set out in the annex to this paper (paragraphs 3-5).b. The repeal of Sections 11-16 of the Employment ProtectionAct 1975 (recognition provisions) (paragraph 6).c. The repeal of Schedule 11 of the Employment Protection Act1975 (terms and conditions of employment)  (paragraphs 7-9).4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALd. The provision to remove immunity from SLAPE-typerecruitment tactics (paragraph 10).e. The formulation &quot;on grounds of conscience&quot; as the definitionof the scope of the protection for those objecting to union membershipin a closed shop (paragraph 14).I also seek colleagues&apos; agreement to the introduction of this Employment Billearly in December with a view to a Second Reading before the ChristmasRecess.J PfDepartment of Employment19 November 19795CONFIDENTIAL
