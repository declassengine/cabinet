CONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENTC(79) 55COPY NO29 October 1979CABINETFUTURE OF VEHICLE EXCISE DUTYMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council1. The future of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) is vitally bound up withthe issues discussed in my paper C(79) 51 on further action to reduce thesize and cost of the Civil Service.    In that paper I say that the outcomeso far of our attempts to make reductions is very disappointing.    We needto secure further reductions wherever possible.    VED is widely thoughtof as a prime example of unnecessary bureaucracy.2, Abolition would enable a saving to be made in the short-term of upto 2, 600 staff or  15 million a year.    This is 1,450 staff and  8 million ayear more than the savings resulting from changes in registration andduty collection procedures which the Minister of Transport has offered tome.    In addition to these major short-term savings, abolition would openthe way in the longer term to further substantial savings by linkingregistration to insurance.     That is just the kind of imaginative possibilityfor reducing the bureaucracy we should be ready and willing to explore.3, I hope that these administrative benefits will be given full considera-tion in arriving at our decision.    The extra increase in the price of petrolneeded to compensate for the loss of revenue from VED is now in relativeterms less significant than it was a few months ago.    And the Report ofthe Official Working Group on VED attached to the Chancellor&apos;s paper(C(79) 50) states that abolition would have no appreciable effects upon themotor industry.,    That Report also makes it clear that for motoristsgenerally there should be a minimal, if any, additional cost and in ruralareas the consequences for motorists may be as little as plus or minus 2. 50 a year, even taking no account of the increased incentive for fueleconomy,    I appreciate the Chancellor&apos;s concern lest abolition reduce thescope for fiscal manoeuvre.    But this tax is widely regarded as unsatis-factory.    Evasion is high and the change would fit well with our philosophythat people should have the maximum possible degree of choice as to howthey spend their money.4. These seem to me to add up to weighty arguments in favour ofabolishing the tax.SCivil Service Department29 October 1979CONFIDENTIAL
