SECRETUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT81 .C(79) 3430 August 1979COPY NOCABINETNORTHERN IRELAND: SECURITYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Northern Irelandand the Secretary of State for Defence1. We have been considering together since we took office the questionof improving the effectiveness of our security operations in NorthernIreland, and the quality of the help we get from the Republic of Ireland.A number of questions are still under examination but recent events haveled us to bring forward certain proposals now for immediate action, asset out in the Annex to this memorandum.2. If these proposals have the support of colleagues, it would enablethe Prime Minister on behalf of the Government to make a public statementabout security in Northern Ireland on the following lines:i. To reassert our determination to protect the people of theUnited Kingdom against terrorism using all our collectiveresources.    Our aim remains the defeat of terrorism and theextension of normal policing.ii. To achieve this we have decided that some changes arenecessary now.    These include the creation of a new SecurityDirectorate in Northern Ireland accountable to the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland.iii. We share a common concern with the Republic of Ireland indefeating terrorism on both sides of the Border.    We haveproposed a fresh approach to the Government of the Republic at thehighest level to improve all aspects of our co-operation.H AF PNorthern Ireland Office30 August 1979SECRET
SECRETANNEXE1H The two-fold aim of security policy in Northern Ireland is to extend normalpolicing and to eliminate terrorism.   In some parts of Northern Ireland the twoparts of the objective can be pursued concurrently, in others the struggleagainst terrorism predominates.   Throughout Northern Ireland the Army operatesin support of the civil power.2*8 There is, however, a clear public expectation that the Government will beexamining security policy in the light of the events of the weekend.   We havedone this under the following heads:(i) The direction and co-ordination of the security effort in NorthernIreland;(ii) Security co-operation with the Republic of Ireland.The direction and co-ordination of the security effort in Northern Ireland3.j We have concluded that the present arrangements for the direction of securityoperations under the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland could be improved,in particular the best use is not being made of our resources and unnecessaryoperational problems are created.   We are both agreed on the need for action here.There are a number of constraints on us:I(a) the ultimate authority of Ministers and in particular the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland must be maintained, not least becauseany apparent divorce between political policy and security policy willmake political progress impossible;(b) the Chief Constable, whose Force plays an increasing part in thestruggle against the terrorists, is accountable only to the law;he cannot be made accountable either to a Minister or to anyother person without legislation;(c) our policy is to proceed against the terrorist through the normalmachinery of law and order, and not to follow the terrorist intodetracting from the normal standards:   to undermine the independenceof the Chief Constable, or to put the RUC under some quasi militarydirection, would undermine our position;(d) we cannot afford to abandon either the elimination of terrorismor the extension of normal policing.Within these constraints we think it is possible to make a significant change&amp;ur present arrangements, which will both improve the efficiency of our opera-Is and have public impact. There is a danger of course that any changes follow-jlast weekend1s incidents will be misrepresented by the Provisional IRA forlr own purposes, but as a result of our discussion in recent weeks, we arepnced that these changes are worth making in their own right.   We tan expectp&quot;ge section of public opinion to welcome them.Tae Secretary of State for Northern Ireland must remain responsible forPing the implementation of the Government1 s policy there.   But -he needs to beorted by better machinery than exists at present for the conduct and planningpecurity operations.   He has already established a new security policy groupSECRET
SECRETta-ing together on a regular basis the Chief Constable and GOC under his chair-Ihip to determine security policy.   We now propose additionally a new SecurityfJctorate in Stormont under the personal direction and control of the SecretaryJtate for Northern Ireland.(i) The Directorate would have a joint senior staff consisting ofrepresentatives of the Northern Ireland Office, the Army and thepolice (at Brigadier/Assistant Chief Constable level).(ii) It would maintain a 2k hour responsibility for monitoring develop-ments, proposing initiatives and reporting as appropriate.(iii) The Directorate would be responsible for exercising central co-ordination on behalf of the Secretary of State where this isrequired.   As appropriate, it could be augmented by more seniorofficers as necessary up to and including the Chief Constable andthe GOC under the Secretary of State1s direction.(iv) In conjunction where appropriate with the Director and Co-ordinatorof Intelligence, it would work on forward planning of securitypolicy operations both in pursuance of remits from the Secretaryof State and on its own initiative.Inior official would be appointed to head up the new Directorate and would betonsible to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.   We would want a mansufficient seniority and experience, perhaps of DUS rank, to be able to co-Lnate effectively all aspects of operational planning and to establish theft relationship with the Chief Constable and the GOC.Co-ordination is equally important in the field.   Problems arise on theid when the security forces have to react to incidents.   Quick decisions arehired if both forces are to make full use of their separate resources andferent skills.   A working party, established by the Secretary of State for[hern Ireland, has agreed that improvements in communication and understandingjneeded.   A detailed examination is already being made of individual areas in[hern Ireland.   The Working Party is likely to recommend a clearer focus onDivisional Police Chief Superintendent as the key commander and a more positive[son between him (and his 2k hour-a-day staff) and local army units.There are other measures we could consider:   some of these can be dealt with- for instance, a unilateral decision to reintroduce detention would betically disastrous.   But other ideas would be worth re-examining within theDirectorate, including the closure of certain border roads, the proscription&apos;rovisional Sinn Fein, more vigorous use of the SAS, increased use of the UDR,lible changes in the lav; against terrorism.   None of these is a matchwinner,all could be looked at again by the new Directorate.   Some are already underew, together-with, of course, the scope for improving our intelligence effort.jSeeuritv Co-Operation with the Republic of Irelandthe defeat of terrorism it is essential that the Republic:Make a concerted and sustained effort against terrorists in the Borderareas - involving closer co-operation with the RUC, swifter reaction toincidents, and the better organised surveillance of the Border.Mount a sustained campaign against the manufacture of home-made explos-ives in the South (from which comes most of   the explosives used byterrorists in Northern Ireland).(b)(c)Put a far greater effort into acquiring intelligence about terro-rists, and sharing it with us - and quickly.We must take the opportunity given to us by recent events to secure, in theof our general policy, co-operation from the Irish at the highest level*nS to more effective action against terrorism.Llcly that they are doing this.79 SEGRETWe must ask them to say
