CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 339 August 1979CABINETRHODESIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs1. I attach at Annex A the speech which the Prime Minister made inthe debate on Southern Africa at Lusaka, and at Annex B the passage enRhodesia in the communique to which we managed to secure agreement.2. The agreement closely follows the line of our policy as set out bythe Prime Minister in the House of Commons and in her speech to Headsof Government last week.    Its main features are:-a. Recognition by the Commonwealth that there is a newdimension in Rhodesia.    President Nyerere drew particularattention to this in his own statement to the meeting.    The changeof attitude which the Prime Minister and I found in Lusaka issignificant.b. Total absence of condemnation of Bishop Muzorewa or ofendorsement of the Patriotic Front - in complete contrast to theResolution adopted at the Organisation of African Unity Summitonly ten days before.c. Commonwealth affirmation that it is Britain&apos;s constitutionalresponsibility to grant legal independence to Rhodesia on the basisof majority rule with appropriate safeguards for minorities, andCommonwealth agreement to work to that end and to help bringabout a cessation of hostilities and an end to sanctions.-d*      Agreement that it is for Britain to arrange supervision offresh elections in Rhodesia.    There would be Commonwealthobservers, which is in our interest.    There would be no inter-national supervision.3. The Prime Minister made clear in the House of Commons on25 July that we intended to put forward firm proposals designed to bringRhodesia to legal independence on a basis comparable to that on which wegranted independence to other former British territories.    This impliedthat we would seek changes in the constitution of the internal settlementwhich contains two features not found in any independence constitutionsCOPY NO821CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALgranted by Britain;  the blocking power of the whites (the Cyprusconstitution of i960 did give the minority community (ie the Turks)power to block certain constitutional amendments.    But the constitutionitself was not granted by Britain, and the population ratio was 70:30(as against 97:3 in Rhodesia)V and the power given to the four Commissionscontrolling appointments to the Police, Armed Forces, Public Servicesand the Judiciary,    It is these aspects of the constitution to which theLusaka communique refers.4. Our colleagues in the Defence and Oversea Policy Committeeagreed before Lusaka that we should aim to discuss the form of arevised constitution at a constitutional conference in the classicdecolonisation pattern.    We would have preferred not to mention this inthe Lusaka communique but changes in the constitution so clearly implieda constitutional conference that the Prime Minister and I agreed to theformula used, which protects the full authority of Cabinet. Thecommunique also draws attention to the obvious fact that a governmentformed under an independence constitution would have to be chosen throughnew elections.    Such elections are anyway essential to a settlement if itis to gain international acceptance and bring the war to an end.5. I believe that we must now move quickly to take advantage of theagreement reached at Lusaka.    We have been in close touch withBishop Muzorewa throughout and he already knows, from his talks withthe Prime Minister in London, what we have in mind.    I therefore proposethat I should issue invitations next week to the parties to the conflict toattend a constitutional conference at Lancaster House beginning on4 September.    At the same time, I shall give to the parties, and publish,a   statement of our outline proposals for an outline constitution (draft atAnnex C).    The draft is designed to indicate an eventual independenceconstitution which:-a. would be comparable to the terms on which independencewas granted to other Commonwealth countries in Africa;b. would offer enough protection to the whites to encourage themto stay; andc. would be in such terms that we could claim to the AfricanPresidents and others that a refusal by the Patriotic Front toattend the constitutional conference or to work within thetraditional framework of an independence constitution would beunreasonable and a proof of bad faith on their part.6. I would intend to make a separate statement at the time theproposals were published, emphasising the importance we attach toenabling the white community  t o play a full part in the future of thecountry and holding out a firm promise of legal independence and the liftingof sanctions once the proposals are implemented.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7. I believe we should confine our initial presentation to the bareoutline of the independence constitution.    If we expose the full extent towhich we were prepared to incorporate the substance of the existingconstitution into our own proposals, we should give the Patriotic Frontand their supporters in Africa a chance to claim that we were clearly airninfor a solution based on the internal settlement.    It is very likely that, oncethey get to a conference, the Patriotic Front will reject our proposals.But we should not make it easy for them to claim that it is not worth theirwhile attending the conference at all.    This would only make it moredifficult for us to demonstrate that it is their intransigence which is themain obstacle to a wider agreement.8. The constitution we would put forward at the conference would belargely compatible with the existing Rhodesian constitution (a great dealof which is comparable to provisions contained in constitutions we havegranted).    But certain changes are essential if we are to carry worldopinion (including United States and European Allies) with us. Theseare described in Annex D.9. I invite my colleagues to agree that I should:-a. issue next week invitations to a constitutional conferenceto begin on 4 September;b. table for discussion at the Conference constitutionalproposals along the lines described in Annex C;c. begin now the varied preparatory work and consultationswith the parties to the conference, with the Commonwealth andwith our other friends and allies, which are necessary if weare to obtain the beat possible psychological conditions in whichto begin a conference.CForeign and Commonwealth Office9 August 19793CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALANNEX CRHODESIA:    OUTLINE OF PROPOSALS FOR AN INDEPENDENCE CONSTITUTION1. Zimbabwe will be in independent sovereign state in which allcitizens will enjoy equal rights under the law.2. There will be a &quot;constitutional&quot; Head of State.3. The Head of Government will be the Prime Minister, who wille a member of the House of Assembly having the support of aarjority in that House.     Power to appoint and dismiss Ministerswill be exercised in accordance with the advice of the Prime&quot;inister.Parliament will consist of a Senate and a House of Assembly.jThe Senate will be indirectly elected, and a majority of its(members will be Africans.     It will have power to delay but notlock bills passed by the House of Assembly.     The House ofssembly will be directly elected by universal adult suffrage.-5-     For a specified minimum period after independence theouse of Assembly will contain a minority of seats reserved for-epresentatives to be elected by the European community. Theroportion of these seats to the total number of seats in theouse will be a matter for discussion between the Britishovernment and the Rhodesian parties.Parliament will have power to amend the constitution, whichill prescribe procedures to be followed for effecting suchendments on lines similar to those contained in other independenceonstitutions granted by Britain.The constitution will protect the independence of the&quot;udiciary.Under the law, public servants will carry out the instructionsf Ministers.     Power to appoint, dismiss and discipline members/ofCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL-2-of the public service will be vested in an independent PublicService Commission.     The Constitution will protect the pensionrights of public servants.9. The Commanders of the Police Force and the Defence Forceswill act in accordance with general policy directives givenby the Prime Minister or other responsible Minister. ThePolice Commissioner and each Defence Force Commander will beresponsible for the administration and operational control oftheir forces.     There will be independent Service Commissionsfor the respective forces which will have prescribed powers inthe disciplinary and establishment field.s10. The Public Service Commission, and the other ServiceCommissions, will be appointed on a basis, and with terms ofreference, which will take due account of the need to preservea high standard of efficiency and which also recognise thelegitimate claims of the majority of the population to increasingrepresentation in all forms of public office.     The power tomake certain senior appointments in the Public Service and otherservices will be vested in the Prime Minister, acting afterconsultation with the appropriate Commission.11. There will be a fully justiciable Declaration of Rightsend an independent official to assist in its enforcement.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALANNEX . hTHE RHODESIAN CONSTITUTIONa1. The areas of the Rhodesian Constitution which have been mostpidely criticised are:the extent of white representation in Parliament and thepower of the white representatives to block legislationIacting on their own; andthe membership and terms of reference of the defence andpublic service commissions, which at present inhibit evengradual Africanisation.Oixr objective will be to achieve changes which would not underminehe confidence of the white community, but would render thendependence Constitution defensible to international anddemocratic opinion and more comparable to those we have agreed inranting independence to certain other African countries.ITE REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENTSpecial representation of white and other minorities inarliament - at least for a limited period after independence -s acceptable in principle to much African opinion;    and therelure precedents elsewhere in the Commonwealth.     Thus injPanRanyika out of the 71 seats in the then existing Nationali.ssembly which was continued in office at independence, 10 wereeserved for Europeans and 11 for Asians.     This arrangementasted for the remainder of the life of that National AssemblyInd was then replaced by provision for up to 10 additionalominated members who included Europeans and Asians. Similarrangements were made for Zambia where, for the remainder ofhe life of the existing National Assembly which was continuedn office at independence, 10 out of 75 members had been electedy Europeans on a &quot;reserved roll&quot;.     Thereafter, there wasrovision for up to 5 additional nominated members.     In Kenyahere was no express reservation of seats for racial minorities,6ut 12 out of 117 seats in the Lower House were speciallyelected by the constituency members sitting as an electoral/college.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcollege.     This was designed to achieve, and did achieve, theelection of Europeans.     (There was no comparable provision inNigeria, which had no permanent non-indigenous population of anysize;   minority interests - essentially tribal and regional -were supposed to be protected by the federal structure of theConstitution).3.     Under the present Rhodesian Constitution, the whites havethe power, acting on their own, to block a wide range ofconstitutional... and other bills.     They have 28 seats out of 100 inthe Lower House and a very wide variety of bills, not restrictedto those involving constitutional amendment, require a positivevote of 78 members before they can become law.     This situationis without parallel elsewhere.4-.     Criticism of it could be met in several ways, alone orincombination, eg:a. the majority required to pass the bills in question couldbe reduced so that the Europeans no longer had a blockingpower by themselves;b. the number of white seats could be reduced.     (But tocurtail the blocking power this would need to be accompaniedby a reduction in the required majority, as at (a), or by. an increase in the black seats, as at (c);c. the number of black seats could be increased to give themthe required majority; ord. &apos; the range of bills required to be passed by the requiredmajority could be restricted.3-     Ve suggest that we might aim for:a.     20 white seats in a lower house of 100, with 70 or at most75 votes to be required for major measures (ie thosedealing with specially entrenched sections of theConstitution); or/b.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb.     28 seats in a house of 120, with 80 or 85 votes requiredfor major constitutional measures.POWERS OVER THE PUBLIC SERVICES AND DEFENCE FORCES6.    Under the present arrangements there are independent Commissionsand similar Boards controlling appointments to, and removals from,the public service, the police force, and defence forces and thejudiciary.     The qualifications for membership of the Commissionsand Boards are such that Europeans will have a controlling voicein them for many years.     This, coupled with the terms ofreference of the Commissions, will inhibit even gradualAfricanisation of the senior ranks of the defence and publicservices and of the judiciary in the foreseeable future. Weknow that Bishop Muzorewa wished to appoint an African tosucceed the Cabinet Secretary, but was unable to do so in theface of opposition from the Public Service Commission.     Nor washe able to appoint an African as Deputy Secretary.     There is aneed for simple amendments to attenuate the European dominance ofthe various Commissions, to open up the way for progressiveAfricanisation and to give the Prime Minister power over theselection and retention of his senior officials and servicecommanders (subject to consultation with the appropriateService Commission).OTHER MATTERS7-     Changes in other areas are less essential.     But the presentConstitution makes a coalition government obligatory for the lifeof the first Parliament and entitles every group with more thanfive MPs to automatic representation in the Cabinet.     The PrimeMinister has to accept the parties&apos; nominees for the Cabinetseats:   he has no power to dismiss a Minister.     Bishop Muzorewais already finding these requirements irksome.     There may be aneed for changes in the constitutional requirements in this area,without prejudice to the   political desirability of a coalitiongovernment on more normal terms./8.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL8.     There are other areas of the Constitution where improvements,though not essential, may he desirable - eg to make it easier toacquire land (with adequate compensation for existing owners) forsettlement by Africans.CONFIDENTIAL
