CONFIDENTIALENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 44 COPY NO    8 116 October 1979CABINETCOUNCIL HOUSE RENTS:  PUBLIC EXPENDITURE OBJECTIVESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentIn the course of our discussion on cuts in housing public expenditurethe Chief Secretary and I agreed that the issue of council house rents shouldbe a matter for Cabinet decision.    This paper accordingly sets out proposalson guidelines for council house rent increases over the Public ExpenditureSurvey Committee (PESC) period.PRESENT RENT LEVELS2.      Under the new housing subsidy system, local authorities will continueto set rent levels, but I shall increasingly influence their decisions. Atpresent, the average council house rent for England is about  6. 50 per week -though the average conceals wide variations.    It was allowed to fall in realterms under the previous Government.    In 1974, the average rent accountedfor 8. 6 per cent of gross earnings; in 1977 for 7. 6 per cent;  and now itaccounts for 6. 6 per cent.    This shows that there is scope for localauthorities meeting a greater proportion of their housing costs from rents.The resulting savings in subsidy will reduce public expenditure.    I shouldmention th.t the calculations which underlay the cuts in subsidies which wesuggested in Opposition, and which formed the basis of the Treasury&apos;sproposals (Option E below) were based on an arithmetical mistake. Theyassumed that any given rent increase would yield subsidy savings about50 per cent higher than the true figure.CONSIDERATIONS GOVERNING FUTURE POLICY3&apos;      I agree with the Chief Secretary&apos;s view (C(79) 42) that council houserents should be increased in real terms.    Inevitably, however, increases^ council house rents will become a factor in wage negotiations. Ourjudgment on how fast rents are to rise will therefore relate to broaderPolitical as well as to immediate financial considerations.    Purely on thefinancial side, however, it might be borne in mind that 1 per cent increase111 local authority rent levels yields public expenditure savings of  10 million,but should this lead to an extra 1 per cent going on to the public sector paysettlements this would require an increase in public expenditure of 200 million.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALACTION NEXT YEAR4a       For 1980-81, I intend to set a rent guideline for an increase in rentsof  1. 50p on average; this will represent an average increase in rent of23 per cent as compared with the forecast 15 per cent rise in earnings.This will provide for the  35 million subsidy savings which I have agreedto find next year.OPTIONS FOR REMAINDER OF PESO PERIOD5, For 1981-82 to 1983-84, I have set out 5 possible options for rentincreases.    The Annex to this paper provides a full comparison of theireffects.   It illustrates the average cash and percentage annual increasesin rent, the average cash rent payable each year, and the resulting publicexpenditure savings in real terms.    Increases in rent are shown indeclining percentage terms to get the worst over in early to middle yearsof this Parliament and at the same time provide bigger savings by gettingincreases sooner than would be achieved by a more even spread.OPTION A - RENTS TO GREEN PAPER PERCENTAGE OF EARNINGS6, Option A represents the least difficult course politically.    It wouldconsist of restoring the relationship of rents to earnings to that whichobtained in July 1977 - 7.6 per cent.    This was the date of the previousGovernment&apos;s Green Paper on Housing Policy which declared that over arun of years rents should keep broadly in line with changes in moneyincomes.    Recovering the ground lost since then would enable us to securerent increases in real terms whilst at the same time presenting them asbeing in accordance with the previous Government&apos;s rent policy.    Option Awould result in rent increases, and total savings (including additional savingsset out in paragraphs 12-15 below), as follows:Average rent increase(cash)  1981-82 1982-83 1983-841.50 1.00 0.65Savings  m j^q 245 290(in 1979 Survey prices)OPTION B - RENTS TO PERCENTAGE OF EARNINGS WHEN WE LEFTOFFICE IN 1973-74 - 8.6 per cent7-      Option b would restore the relationship of rents to earnings(8- 6 per cent) which obtained when we left office in 1974.    This Option*ould yield significantly greater savings than Option A, but the politicalinside would be that much greater.    It would result in rent increasesand total savings as follows:CONFIDENTIAL

Option C would provide for still more savings but we would be seento be going well beyond the ratio of rents to earnings when we were last inoffice.   The ratio of rents to earnings would rise to 9.0 per cent. Itwould result in rent increases and savings as follows:Average rent increase(cash)  Savings  m(in 1979 Survey prices)1981-821.902401982-831.803751983-841.55510OPTION D - RENTS RISING TO 10 per cent OF EARNINGS BY 1983-849.       The rent increases and total savings which would be achieved underthis option are set out below.    This is a more extreme version of Options Band C.Average rent increase(cash)  1981-822. 501982-832.15Savings  m(in 1979 Survey prices)310 480OPTION E - THE CHIEF SECRETARY&apos;S PROFOSAL1983-842.006501Q.     Option E is that proposed by the Chief Secretary.    It would securesavings of some  1565 million over the three years and increase averagecouncil rents to 11 per cent of earnings.    The order of rent increases which* implies, however, seems politically unacceptable.    It would certainlynecessitate council rents on average rising above fair rents in the privatesector - a large number of individual rents would in fact be way above fairrents.   We would be seen to be offering council tenants a more severeregime than under the Housing Finance Act 1972, and it would be claimedCONFIDENTIAL

In deciding between the possible options it is necessary to have inmind that:a. the increases for individual tenants will vary widely, with10 per cent of tenants paying at least 20 per cent above average.b. In addition to these rent increases tenants are likely to facesubstantial increases in rates.ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY SAVINGS12. In addition to the rent increases, there are three additional sourcesof public expenditure savings on subsidies which have been included in thecalculations in this paper.13. First, as agreed in the Home and Social Affairs Committee, wepropose to make the subsidy adjustment when a council house is sold in away that gives greater benefit to the Exchequer - and accordingly reducesthe subsidy to local authorities.    My proposals should produce a further 10 million a year subsidy savings cumulatively from this source.14. Second, I have agreed not to provide housing subsidy for any growthin real terms in management and maintenance expenditure.    This willsave some  45 million in 1981-82,  70 million in 1982-83 and  100 millionin 1983-84, and this disposes of one of the points in the Chief Secretary1 spaper.J**      Hhird, because of pressure on rates in 1981-82 local authorities maybe expected to charge to rents any additional current expenditure by way ofloan charges arising on the element of new capital expenditure which doesnot rank for housing subsidy.    Savings of  30 million are included on thisaccount.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6       The annex shows the total public expenditure savings on Options AoD including (a) rent increases, (b) suggested adjustment on sales,c) management and maintenance, and (d) the prospect of all unsubsidisedexpenditure being borne on rents.    The Chief Secretary&apos;s desired savingsirising from (a) and (c) above are likewise shown.CONCLUSIONS17. In the Chief Secretary&apos;s view even Option E would fail to securefull economic rents and his proposal is justified in view of the pressing needfor public expenditure savings.    The rents in the Annex are all in cashterms.   The rent increases required are less severe when expressed inconstant prices.    The effect on less well-off tenants would be moderatedby rent rebates and supplementary benefits which in aggregate would fund40 per cent of the increases in rent.18. The Chief Secretary&apos;s view is that we should adopt Option E. Myown preference, agdnst the background set out above, is for Option B.This would yield total housing savings of nearly  1, 300 million in 1981-82, 1, 650 million in 1982-83 and  1, 850 million in 1983-84 - much greater thanthose on any other programme and some  150 million to  250 million a yeargreater than the reductions provisionally agreed and shown in Annex B ofthe Chief Secretary&apos;s paper.    Whatever our conclusion, the publicpresentation and timing of an announcement of our views on rents will needvery careful handliug.    I would consult colleagues principally concernedand report separately to the Prime Minister on this aspect.M HDepartment of the Environment16 October 19795CONFIDENTIAL
