SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 61 COPY NO10 December 1979CABINETTHE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND PUBLIC EXPENDITUREMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerINTRODUCTION1. I have been taking stock of the economic situation.    The generalstrategy remains the only feasible one but the difficulties we face are greaterthan we had any reason to expect.    I consider that we need to look again atour public expenditure plans and it was evident at our 15 November discussion(CC(79) 21st Conclusions, Minute 4) that many members of the Cabinet sharethis view.    It is imperative to get our policies properly established in ourfirst year of office.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS2. Three developments cause particular concern:-i. With strong wage inflationary pressures, poor trading,productivity and competitiveneas performance and the unpromisingoutlook for world trade following the further large increases in oilprices, the economy is inevitably moving into a recession from whichthere could well be only a slow recovery.ii. Despite the action I took in the Budget, underlying monetarygrowth has been much higher than expected.iii. Inflationary expectations, and hence pay pressures, remain highand intractable.3. This outlook was reflected in the recent Industry Act forecast whichbrought out in particular the deteriorating prospects for output and forreducing the rate of inflation next year;  and some of the assumptions under-lying that forecast (eg on earnings and interest rates) could be over-optimistic.    Recent non-Government forecasts, such as that prepared by theLondon Business School, point in very much the same direction.1SECRET
SECRETACTION SO FAR4. The measures taken in the Budget established our credibility from thestart by signalling our resolve to maintain strict monetary control backed byfiscal policies consistent with it.    And the further measures of 15 Novemberwere dictated by the necessity of maintaining those policies in the face of thedisappointing monetary and Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)developments.    The initial reaction in the markets was favourable and wehave secured substantial gilt sales to help fund this year&apos;s PSBR.    I hope thatthe other effects of the changes will now come through so that money supplygrowth comes into the target range, without even higher interest rates thanthose which we have had no alternative but to accept.    But this will depend ona number of factors some of which we can influence - particularly the market&apos;sassessment of our determination to carry through our policies - and otherswhich we cannot, eg developments overseas.FUTURE ACTION5. The overriding priority is to reduce inflation, as a necessarycondition of resumed and sustainable growth.    In parallel with this we mustsecure a major improvement in the supply side of the economy.    To these endsour policies must embrace the following:-i. Progressive reduction of the rate of growth of the money supplyat tolerable interest rates.ii. Further reductions in the burdens of income tax and capitaltaxation.iii. Substantial reductions in the inherited public expenditure plansand in the size and role of the public sector generally.6. No compromise is possible on i.     Otherwise the credibility of anyGovernment&apos;s strategy on inflation would be destroyed.    Nor can wecompromise on our objective of restoring incentives by reducing taxation.Our weakness on the supply side is still acute and we urgently need to takefurther measures to remedy this.    The single most important contribution wecan make is to reduce taxation at all income levels.    But, with the worseningeconomic prospects, and the difficulty evident from Dublin of getting anacceptable reduction in our European Economic Community contributions,there is now little prospect of attaining our inflation and tax objectives on thebasis of the public expenditure plans agreed so far by Cabinet.7. Disappointment with the 1980-81 White Paper (whose plans were some 2 billion higher than the target the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and I set)contributed to the unsettled market conditions that necessitated the15 November measures.    Many in the markets were hoping for anunequivocal reduction in the volume of expenditure and the PSBR for 1980-81.2SECRET
SECRET8. For the period immediately after 1980-81 a similar situation is inprospect.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, and I warned the Cabinet inSeptember that even with the reductions we proposed it would be hard to holdthe PSBR in the later years to around its present proportion of GrossDomestic Product (GDP) without some real increase in taxation.    2fa the eventthe plans agreed by the Cabinet are more than  1 ball!ojq higher for most of theyears concerned;  and the economic prospect has worsened, as reflected inGovernment and independent forecasts.    Thus on any prudent assessment ofthe economic outlook the present expenditure plans seem incompatible withslower money supply growth unless we have even higher interest rates orhigher taxes, or both.9. Chronic structural weaknesses in the economy - low productivitygrowth and poor trading performance as well as the tendency to higherinflation - appear to have intensified in recent yeers.    These problemscannot be overcome quickly and given also the worsened prospects for theworld economy after the further rise in oil prices the medium-term prospectsfor GDP growth are now poor.    It is against this background that theTreasury&apos;s medium-term analysis has been carried out.    It suggests that thepolicy conflicts are likely to be most acute in the next two years. Forexample, to bring inflation down well into single figures by 1983 entailsgetting monetary growth in that year down to 7 per cent (and the PSBR to2\ per cent of GDP, which should allow interest rates to fall).    On presentexpenditure plans this would require tax increases equivalent to around 5p onthe basic rate of income tax by 1981-82.    There would be no prospect of anyreal reduction in personal taxes from today1 s levels before 1983.10. Two key conclusions emerge.    First, howeTer difficult the short term,the centrepiece of our anti-inflation strategy - progressive reduction inmonetary growth - remains the only feasible one.    But second, stabilisationof our expenditure plans at their present levels is not enough. (And,depending on the treatment of debt interest, it is arguable whether we haveeven done that. )   Unless we reduce plans further we shall not be able to avoidserious damage to our taxation objectives and the risk of even higher interestrates than those we have now.    This is also becoming increasingly clear tothe financial markets and without changes there is a serious risk of a seriesof tensions in the markets, of which that last month was only a firstexample.    Most important, it is also becoming clear to our supporters inParliament that further action on public expenditure is needed.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND THE SECOND WHITE PAPER11. I conclude that our public expenditure plans need to be reduced.    It isdifficult to say with confidence precisely what further reductions would berequired to meet our monetary and tax objectives.    On the Treasury&apos;sprojections, the PSBR for 1980-81 would on present expenditure plans exceed 10 billion, and rise to around  13 billion in 1981-82, or over 5 per cent ofGDP compared with the 4jj per cent expected this year.    A PSBR at this level3SECRET
SECRETwould be a major blow to confidence and it seems very unlikely that we couldfinance it without still higher rates of interest.12. Our room for manoeuvre in 1980-81 is restricted.    We have publishedour plans and they are being acted on by speeding authorities.    For example,it would be difficult now to ask local authorities to make further reductions intheir current expenditure.    But we need to hold the cash limits and to makewhatever further savings we can.    One important decision for 1980-81 not yettaken concerns the uprating of child benefit.    There is also the question offurther savings on housing investment.    In all we ought to be looking for a totalvolume reduction of the order of  1 billion.13. In 1981-82 a reduction of the order of  2 billion appears to be needed.If the total is not to rise again we must carry this reduction forward to thetwo subsequent years.14. We can only make reductions of this order by fundamental new decisionson the major programmes.    The social security programme whichconstitutes over a quarter of public expenditure will need to be a major sourceof the further savings.SECOND WHITE PAPER15. If the above is accepted it points to postponing the White Paperhitherto scheduled for January.    We do not want to publish figures we aresubsequently going to revise;  and to do so would make the revisions moredifficult to achieve,    Any economic projections published with the figureswould also reveal the inconsistencies I have described;  but equally refusal topublish supporting economic material would lead observers to concludethemselves that the figures did not add up.    We certainly would not publishany convincing or viable financial plan incorporating the pre seat expenditurefigures.    So I conclude that we should postpone the White Paper.16. The decision to postpone implies that we shall achieve the necessaryreductions. To delay the White Paper and then publish plans that were stilltoo high would be the worst of all worlds.17. Nor could we let the uncertainty run on too long.    We need to publishthe White Paper not later than the Budget and preferably in March.    This willrequire an intensive operation which we should aim to complete by the end ofJanuary.CONCLUSION18. I recognise the difficulty of the decision I am asking the Cabinet tomake, and of the subsequent decisions necessary to implement it. Butwithout this decision it will become widely apparent that our policies are4SECRET
SECRETinconsistent and that our expenditure plans are incompatible with our monetaryand taxation objectives;  and that there is a serious risk that even morepainful measures would become unavoidable.19.        I therefore propose that:-i. We undertake an exercise, which we should aim to complete bythe end of January, to identify savings of  1 billion in 1980-81 and 2 billion a year in 1981-82 and subsequent years.ii. We postpone the next Public Expenditure White Paper and aim topublish it in March.G HTreasury Chambers10 December 1979SECRET5
