CONFIDENTIALUMENT is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s governmentC(79) 5126 October 1979;opy noCABINETFURTHER ACTION TO REDUCE THE SIZE OFTHE CIVIL SERVICEMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council1. Cabinet agreed on 13 September (CC(79) 15th Conclusions, Minute 8)to aim at savings in Civil Service staff costs amounting to 10 per cent; afull contribution from the Ministers in charge of the largest Departmentswas essential for this purpose, and all Ministers should re-examine theirstaff levels in order to save at least 10 per cent wherever possible.    I wasinvited to discuss Ministers&apos; proposals with them and to bring detailedproposals to Cabinet.2. Either I or my Minister of State, accompanied by Lord Cockfield,held discussions with colleagues in charge of all sizeable Departments.Some very small Departments were dealt with in correspondence.Annexes 1 and 2 show the amounts of the savings offered by Departments.Annexes 3 and 4 show the main decisions that are needed to achieve them;those in Annex 4 involve some major and controversial policy decisionswhich will require collective discussion.    Annex 5 lists major reviews inprogress which should yield additional savings, bat the size of which cannotyet be estimated.    Annex 6 lists the major options requiring primarylegi slation.OUTCOME OF DISCUSSIONS3. The outcome has been very disappointing.    Firm offers of savingsat present (that is, excluding Annexes 4 and 5) amount to barely 6 per cent(about  250 million).    This is a gross figure which was always the intentionof this exercise.    But from the point of view of savings in public expenditurewe must bear in mind the cost of putting work out to the private sector.Some of the options which make it up will require legislation (Annex 6) andcould affect the timing of their implementation.    The contributions to it fromthe largest Departments amount to 8.7   per &quot;cent from the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s Departments, 3.1 per cant from the Department of Health andSocial Security where the opportunity for larger savings depends on majorpolicy decisions (Annex 4), and only 3 per cent from Defence whcrs furthermajor studies are in hand the results of which are so far uncertain (Annex 5).In view of these figures, this can but be an interim report.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4.     To bridge the gap between 6 per cent and 10 per cent will involve:-a. Defence finding a further 7 per cent, be it from the studiesin hand or elsewhere; andb. taking the policy decisions listed in Annex 4; andc. either abolishing Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) or findingabout  10 million more in staff savings from other Departments.CHOICES OPEN TO US FOR DECISION TODAY5. There are three choices:-i. Announcing savings of 6 per cent with no more than a vagueexpectation of something more to come from further decisions inthe future; which I would regard as unacceptable both in politicalterms and because of insufficient savings.ii.       Taking today the decisions listed in paragraph 4;  which seemsto me unrealistic.iii.       Dividing the operation into two parts and making anannouncement which is explicitly interim at this stage with theassurance of further substantial savings to come in the springor summer of next year.6. Course iii seems to me the only feasible outcome.    But we mustbe in no doubt of what it commits us to.    Above all it commits us to finda further 7 per cent ( 95 million) in manpower costs from Defence. Weneed a further  70 million from the policy decisions listed in Annex 4 (orothers) and a further  10 million from VED or elsewhere.    To keep theimpetus going we should set ourselves the target of completing the secondstage by next spring.7. If colleagues agree I will circulate a draft statement.    The NationalStaff Side and (for industrial civil servants) the Joint ConsultativeCornmittee will need to be informed and I would do this on the same day asthe public announcement, and colleagues will presumably wish to informtheir local staff representatives at the same time.FUTURE GROWTH8. In the course of the last few months, it has become clear thatoffsetting increases in future staff expenditure are in prospect. Theymainly arise in the fields of employment, social security, prisons andthe courts.    Annex 7 shows the increases I foresee as unavoidable,amounting to  74 million -1.7 per cent of our baseline for the presentexercise - in 1982-83 (and with a peak, if we proceed with the 1981 Census,of  92 million in 1981-82).2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL9. These are a separate matter from the savings we are discussingand I do not propose to include them in the announcement, but they makea disappointing picture still more bleak.    They make it all the morenecessary to aim for a large second tranche, to pursue greater efficiencyby all available means including Sir Derek Rayner&apos;s programme, and toexercise rigorous restraint on all new demands.    If colleagues wish tointroduce some new activity which will require more staff, then they mu3tfind the means by dropping other work.    Any exceptions will have to beapproved by Civil Service Department Ministers.CONCLUSION10. I invite my colleagues to agree that:-a. we should announce savings of 6 per cent now, making clearthat there will be a further announcement about a second tranche;which meansb. as regards the second tranche, we must accept the cornmit-ments set out in paragraph 6;c. there must be continuing and rigorous containment of staffexpenditure^ and in particular no new additions without compensatingsavings unless exceptionally it is agreed otherwise.SCivil Service Department26 October 19793CONFIDENTIAL
