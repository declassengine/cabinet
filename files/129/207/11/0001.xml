CONFIDENTIALCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79)41 o1COPY NO   0 12 October 1979CABINETL.T0UID MILK PRICESMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and FoodINTRODUCTION1. The returns of our milk producers - which are central to ouragricultural policy - depend upon the prices they receive from the liquidand milk products markets.    The latter depend essentially upon decisionstaken in Brussels on EEC support prices, but the Government is itselfresponsible for determining maximum prices for liquid milk at bothwholesale and retail levels.    In this paper I make proposals on thoseprices for the 6 months from October to March.BACKGROUND2. In May we increased the maximum retail price of milk by l^p perpint.    The previous Governments deliberate postponement of a pricedecision meant that virtually the whole of this l^p had to go to thedistributors, to meet sharp increases in their costs and make good the2 months&apos; delay.    We hoped then that the wholesale price could beincreased in October sufficiently to give dairy farmers a reasonablereturn for the autumn without a further retail price increase until theNew Year.3. This is no longer possible.    The measured costs of the distributorsprove to have increased more than was then thought, and the rate of costinflation in October-March will be higher than we then expected.    As aresult the increase in the wholesale price on 1 October can be only abouthalf what we expected.MILK PRODUCERS&apos; NET MARGINSBecause of this, and because their own costs have increased, dairyfarmers&apos; margins in the April-March year, if there were no increase inthe retail price, would be only about  75 a cow.    That would be the lowestMargin for 5 years, apart from the drought year of 1976-77, and inparticular it would compare with  96 in 1978-79 and the  108 that woulde needed to give producers this year the same return in real terms.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. In Opposition we condemned tLat level as inadequate, and ourManifesto criticised the previous Government for seriously underminingthe profitability of agriculture.    It also pledged us to ensure that ourindustry had the means of keeping abreast oi those in other countries.We therefore need, at the very least, to maintain the level of net marginswhich dairy farmers obtained in the last year of the Labour Government(1978-79).    As the recent 1.1 per cent green pound devaluation will haveonly minimal effect on margins in 1979-80 and as the effect of any furthergreen pound devaluation would not now show through until next year, the onlyway we can do this is by an early and adequate increase in liquid milkprices.    This means raising the retail price by l^p per pint on18 November in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and on 21 Octoberin Scotland (where there is a greater backlog of distribution costs to meet),if all of my recommendations are agreed.    Details of these changes,together with public expenditure and other implications, are given in theappended note by my officials based on figures agreed with officials ofthe Treasury and Department of Trade.6. Because returns from the milk products market have been sodepressed, this would still leave the average producer price in thiscountry well below the EEC target price, and lower than in any otherMember State;  and, in so far as it helped maintain our own output, itwould be entirely consistent with our wider objective in Brussels ofsecuring a cut-back in production from inefficient farmers on theContinent and concentrating it in those areas, such as the United Kingdom,which are best suited to dairying.SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND7.        The figures quoted above and in the annex relate to England andWales.    The position in Scotland and Northern Ireland is howevercomparable - though two areas of difficulty do arise.    The delay inimplamentLng the last two retail price increases in Scotland now turnsout, against expectations, to have resulted in an under-recoupment ofdistributors&apos; costs.    This means we have to make up the balance indistribution costs there.    Part of this can be achieved by bringing thechange in the retail price forward by 4 weeks on this occasion, with theremainder falling due next spring.    Secondly, an increase in the retailprice will widen the gap between the returns of producers in NorthernIreland and those in the rest of the United Kingdom.    This means that wewill need this year to pay the special milk aid at the maximum level of!.3p per litre permitted under the special EEC authorisation. However,even this will leave net margins in Northern Ireland  18 per cow belowthose in England and Wales.DISTRIBUTORS&apos; PROFIT8*       We also have to decide on the distributors&apos; target profit per gallonfor the year from 1 October.    We have appointed independent accountantsto review the whole method of measuring distribution costs and determiningProfits.    Pending their report we do not propose to increase the targetProfit, even though this means a sharp reduction in real terms (the last2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALGovernment&apos;s practice was to maintain its real value). Thisdistributors will strongly resent, but the alternative is to increase theretail price further or sooner, and we do not think this justified. Tomaintain the value in real terms would require an extra 0.1072p per litre,equivalent to  1. 50 per cow off producers&apos; margins, or bringing thelip per pint retail price increase forward by 8 days.STERILISED MILK9, We also have to decide on the premium allowed on sterilised milk(7 per cent of liquid milk sales).    This has stood at jp per pint for8 years.    Its inadequacy is proved by the decline in the numbers ofdistributors now producing this milk.    In order to maintain freedom ofchoice for the consumer and allow an adequate margin for the trade, Ipropose to increase the premium to lp from 18 November.    Leaving thepremium at ^p per pint is equivalent to  1. 00 per cow off producers&apos;margins, or bringing the l^p per pint retail price increase forward by6 days.RECOMMENDATIONS10. I invite my colleagues to agree:-i.       that the maximum retail price of milk should be increasedby l^p per pint (ie from I5p to 16^p for pasteurised milk) from18 November in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and from21 October in Scotland;ii.      that the present target rate of profit for distributorsshould remain unchanged;iii. that the ^p per pint premium for sterilised milk should beincreased to lp from 18 November;iv. that accordingly the maximum wholesale price in Englandand Wales should be increased by 3.465p per litre on 1 November,with corresponding increases in Scotland and Northern Ireland.P Winistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodOctober 19793CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALANNEXIQUID MILK PRICESNTRODUCTIONThe returns to milk producers are derived from both the liquidIndmilk products markets.   The latter is under-pinned by the EEClupport arrangements for butter and skimmed milk powder, and is thusetermined essentially by decisions taken in Brussels under theommon Agricultural Policy.   The prices for liquid milk are howeveretermined quite separately by UK Ministers.   Under the present sys-em, this involves fixing maximum wholesale and retail prices onApril and 1 October each year for the succeeding six-monthlylummer and winter periods.   The difference between the wholesale andletail prices constitutes the distributive margin, which covers the;s of processing and distributing liquid milk, plus a target rateIf profit for the dairy trade (which is also determined by theovernment).Last May, Ministers decided that the maximum wholesale priceor liquid milk in England and Wales should be set at 12.943p peritre as from 1 June, and that the maximum retail price should bencreased by l p to 15p per pint.   Similar increases were implemented&amp; the other parts of the UK, although the retail price increase incotland was not applied until 24 June.   A decision is now requiredn the winter prices to apply from 1 October, and on the dairy trade&apos;sarget rate of profit for the 12 months commencing on that same date.ISTRIBUTIVE MARGINBecause the spring price changes had to be delayed this year^*1 1 June, the increase in the distributive margin needed to covere dairy trade&apos;s costs for the summer months was larger than wouldtherwise have been the case.   It was therefore forecast at the timeCONFIDENTIAL
that we would on 1 October be able to reduce their margin fortwinter months by about 1.3p per litre, and that this would beby a corresponding increase in the wholesale price.   As this isprice received by the Milk Marketing Boards from the dairy tradthis would have benefited producers.   However, the informationnow available to us shows that the dairy trade&apos;s costs areincreasing faster than we anticipated and that we shall need alarger distributive margin during the winter than we thought,a result, the wholesale price can be increased by only 0.635pper litre from 1 October - which means that only half the amounwe expected will be available for producers.    Since the 1 Octol)date has passed we will need to make the change on 1 November,the necessary increase will be 0.763p per litre.    The Treasurysuggested that a lower forecast rate of inflation should be u;for the October 79 - March 80 period, but it has been agreed thjthis is more than offset by the increase in unit costs resultinfrom the fall in throughput caused by the proposed retail priceincrease.TARGET RATE OF PROFIT4. The target rate of profit is fixed by Government each yearthe 12 months costings period commencing on 1 October, and iscurrently 0.8579p per litre (3.9p per gallon). In their submisto us, the Dairy Trade Federation have not proposed any specififigure for 1979/80, and have merely asked for an increase whichtakes into account the fall in the value of money over the lastyear, plus an adjustment towards a higher depreciation allow8&quot;&quot;As the basis for setting the target rate of profit is oneof ff wquestions which is being considered in the current review oi2
CONFIDENTIALcostings system, this would clearly not he the right time to makeany radical changes.    The main question, therefore, is whetherany simple adjustment should he made to the target rate, forexample to preserve its real value.    Such an approach could increasethe present figure by 0.1072p per litre to 0.9651p per litre: butof course, all other things remaining unchanged, this would increasethe distributive margin and thus reduce still further the amountavailable to producers through the maximum wholesale price.O.1072p per litre on the margin from October 79 to March 1980 isequivalent to  1.50 per cow off producers&apos;net margins, or thereturn from a retail price increase of l^p per pint for 8 days.PRODUCER RETURNS5.   At the time of the spring review, the net margins per cow forproducers in 1978/79 and 1979/80 were estimated to be  99 and  103respectively.    Now that the full impact of last winter&apos;s severeconditions has been more fully assessed, the figure for 1978/79 hasbeen revised down to  95.    However,  these factors - together withfurther increases in producers&apos;  costs on such items as feed - havealso affected the projected net margin for 1979/80.    If there was tobe no further change in the retail price before next April, and thetarget rate of profit for distributors was merely maintained in realterms at its present level, the latest indications are that thisSure would be as little as  75 per cow.    This is somewhat lowertllan     might have been, as the equivalent of about  6 per cow isbeing deducted from producer prices by the MMB towards thedancing of their recent takeover of 16 Unigate creameries. Buteven an adjusted figure of  81 would be some  27 below the  108Heeded to -10 give producers the same return in real terms as in1978/ 79.fiCONFIDENTIAL
6. Such a figure takes no account of the increased amount andcost of tenant-type borrowing.    It also has to be seen againstbackground where, despite a slight increase in the national her(following the relatively good year enjoyed by milk producers i1977/78), milk yields are down, and production in the first5 months of the current milk year only marginally (0.2$) moretthat in the corresponding period for 1978/79.   Moreover, themain indicators all point to a down-turn in cow numbers.Slaughterings are lk% higher than last year; dairy inseminationfrom April-August 1979 are 5.3$ down on 1978; and there isevidence of an increasing interest among milk producers in theEECs non-marketing scheme.7. As a net margin for 1979/80 of  81 per cow would be almostJidentical in real terms to that for 1976/77, it seems certain 1this would lead to a contraction in the size of the national hjwith an ultimate loss of perhaps 100,000 cows.    This would inciour import requirement by about  40 million a year.    It willtherefore be necessary to increase producer returns in order t(avoid this: and, as the continuing relative strength of sterliireduced the scope for increasing manufacturing returns throughdevaluing the green pound, the only alternative is to increasereturns from the liquid market.8. This means increasing the maximum wholesale price. And,order to allow for the distributive margin,  that means increasthe maximum retail price as well.

Now that the Scottish costings exercise for 1977/78 has beencompleted it is clear that distributors1 costs have been increasinjat about the same rate as in England and Wales.   This means that,against all expectations, the delay in implementing the last 2 retprice increases in Scotland was not justified and this, coupled nilestimated higher costs in Scotland in the period to March 1980, nojthe pay award due from February 1, 1980 (April 1 in England and Wapoints to the need in Scotland, for about 1p per pint more on theretail price for about 12 weeks more than in England and Wales. Iproposed retail price increase should take effect in Scotland 4 wfearlier than in England and Wales:   the balance due to distributeScotland will have to be made up by a further temporary adjustmentearly in the New Year.NORTHERN IRELAND11. Any further increase in the retail price will, because of tnjmuch lower proportion of liquid sales to total production in NortIreland than in England and Wales, increase producers&apos; returns idNorthern Ireland to a lesser extent than elsewhere. In the eventa 1-Jp per pint increase late in October or early in November retuin Northern Ireland for 1979/80 would be about 1.75p per litre btEngland and Wales.   As part of the CAP price-fixing in June.the6
CONFIDENTIALoil of Ministers (Agriculture) extended the authority for theent of the Northern Ireland special milk aid, which is intendedridge this gap.   However, the authority limited the aid to 1.3plitre with the result that Northern Ireland producers will bet 0.4-5p per litre worse off than their counterparts in EnglandWales over the year as a whole.   This is equivalent to a reductionheir net margin of about  18 per cow in 1979/80.&quot;USED MILKAt present the maximum retail price for sterilised milk, whichmnts for about 7% of total liquid milk sales, is set at a premium1p per pint over the level for pasteurised milk in order to reflecthigher costs of sterilising.   The dairy companies who processilised milk have made an application through the DTP for an increasehe retail premium to meet increased processing costs.   The premiumremained- constant since 1969, despite the steady increase inilising costs, and despite the fact that a number of sterilisingies have ceased production because of the inadequacy of thellising margin.   There are therefore strong grounds for increasingretail premium for sterilised milk to 1p per pint from the datehe next retail price increase.   This move would have the effect^distributing the existing distributive margin in favour of theRisers and, in a full year, of generating an additional  4 millionme for the industry as a whole.   This would increase producers&apos;margins in 1979/80 by about  1 per cow, equivalent to the returnQur increase in the price of pasteurised milk of l p per pint6 days.CONFIDENTIAL
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS13.   A retail price increase of l p per pint at the beginning ofNovember is expected to result in a fall in liquid milk consumptionup to the end of March 1980 of 48 million litres;   the fall result!from a ip per pint increase would be 32 million litres.   On theassumption that all of this milk went to butter manufacture and theall of the extra butter was sold to intervention the direct extracost to the Exchequer in 1979/80 would be  3.6 million for a &quot;l p pepint increase and  2.4 million for a 1p per pint increase. Thisdirect cost does not take account of extra storage and finance costHowever, it should be noted that the full cost is reimbursed to theUK from FEOGA when the produce is sold.   Inasmuch as the UK contri-bution to FEOGA is 16% the cost to the UK would be  0.6 millionfor l p per pint or  0.4 million for 1p per pint.   If, however, thebutter were sold on the open market, which is equally possible, theimport savings on the balance of payments would be about  3.6 milli(l p increase) or  2.4 million (1p increase);    and there would henExchequer costs.1 October 1979
