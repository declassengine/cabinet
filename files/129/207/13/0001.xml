CONFIDENTIALJMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 4312 October 1979COPY NO81CABINETINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS LEGISLATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Employment1. Colleagues have already generally approved my proposals forlegislation on picketing, the closed shop and union ballots and I aim tointroduce a Bill in December.    To achieve that we need to decide now onthe following outstanding points.CLOSED SHOP2. We have already decided to provide that any new closed shopentered into after our legislation shall not be able to operate as a defenceagainst an unfair dismissal claim unless at least 80 per cent of thoseentitled to vote in a secret ballot support it; that existing employees shallbe protected; that, where an unfair dismissal takes place under unionpressure, the employer can bring the union before the tribunal to meetsome or all of the compensation;  and that best practice in the operationof a closed shop will be set out in a statutory Code.3. V/e also intend to extend the protection to those with conscientiousgrounds age inst union membership in a closed shop situation and what wehave to decide is how wide should be the grounds of conscience - religiononly at the moment - and whether these should be limited to objection tobelonging to any union at all or whether they should also include objectionto belonging to a particular union. The Confederation of British Industry(CBI)were divided on the latter question - a substantial minority (includingthe Engineering Employers Federation) fearing that the right to object tobelonging to a particular union would be used by dissidents to splinterunions and disrupt established bargaining arrangements. Nonetheless,a majority of the CBI favour allowing objections to joining any particularunion, but on as objective a basis as possible and limited to objections thatare religious, ethical or moral.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4, There is a difficult balance to be struck here between the rights ofthe individual and the orderly conduct of industrial relations. Onreflection, I think it is right to allow for objections against a particularunion.    This would give individuals support and protection in closed shopsituations of the kind which have arisen in the ambulance and fire services.5. I therefore propose protection for those who &quot;have religious,ethical or moral objections tc being a member of any union whatsoever orof a particular union&quot;.    By limiting the exemption to these cases we shouldlessen fears that it will seriously disrupt stable bargaining arrangements,though we may still stimulate increased demands to do something about&quot;free riders&quot;.UNREASONABLE EXCLUSION OR EXPULSION FROM A UNION6. We have agreed to provide a new statutory right against unreasonableexclusion or expulsion from a trade union, leaving the reasonableness to bedetermined by tribunals on the equity and substantial merits of the case.I have, however, also been considering whether to strengthen the effect ofthis in countering intimidation by stating expressly in the legislation thatit would be unreasonable to expel a member solely for crossing a picketline or for refusing to take part in a strike which has been called in breachof procedure.7. On re-examination, I am confident that the general test ofreasonableness could be expected to encompass these types of case. Infact, most industrial action is unofficial and unions therefore do notgenerally discipline members for refusing to take part in it.    But whereexpulsion arose in circumstances of the kind described a tribunal wouldbe able to take into account the reasonableness of the industrial action inwhich the individual had refused to participate and the manner of itsinception and prosecution.8. I feel, nonetheless, that it would be desirable to give tribunals aclear guide to regarding expulsion in the circumstances described as primafacie unreasonable.    I do not favour doing this by express statutoryprovision.    Interference in the disciplinary relationship between unionsand their members is an explosive issue and we could be dragged deep intoit by statutory definition, with the risk even so that the express provisioncould be evaded or result simply in unofficial intimidation taking the placeof official disciplining.9-       I now propose instead to proceed by including in the draft statutoryCode of Practice on the closed shop guidance to the effect that discipliningbY expulsion should normally be regarded as unreasonable behaviour if takensolely on such grounds as that a member crosses a picket line or refuses totake part in industrial action which is in breach of a procedure agreement.A plaintiff would be able to draw attention to this in pleading his case beforethe tribunal, which would then be able to consider it among all theC1r cum stances of the case.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL10.       This will increase the Parliamentary pressure to defer operation ofthe legislation until Parliament has approved the Code.    We may have toconcede this in relation to the unreasonable expulsion provision, butotherwise there is no need for the operation of the legislation to wait oneither this Code or the Code on picketing.CLOSED SHOP IN THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRYU.       My proposal in paragraph 5 above will help give effect to ourcommitment to resist further moves towards the closed shop in thenewspaper industry.    I propose to reinforce it by providing a separatesection in the closed shop Code which will relate specifically to the positionof journalists.    This would, among other things, make clear that a genuinebelief concerning Press freedom is a conscientious ground for objecting tobecoming or remaining a member of a particular union or any union at all;and that journalists and editors should not be disciplined as a result oftheir legitimate exercise of Press freedom,12.       These measures will be much more effective in containing thisthreat to the freedom of the Press than the Press Charter provisions ofthe last Government.    These envisaged a voluntary approach which in factfoundered on irreconcilable differences between the various parties; andthe last Government then failed to submit a draft Charter for the approvalof Parliament.    I propose therefore to repeal the provision for a PressCharter (Section 2 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment)Act 1976).SLADE13. In fulfilment of our commitment I set up an enquiry byMr Andrew Leggatt QC into the recruitment activities of the Society oflithographic Artists, Designers, Engravers and Process Workers (SLADE)and I shall publish his report on 17 October.    The report is highly criticalof SLADE, the two most objectionable aspects of its recruitment activitiesbeing the forcing of employees to join the union against their will and theuse of secondary action to achieve this.14. The issues are complex and it is difficult to frame a statutoryprovision limited to catching these objectionable activities. Nonetheless,a remedy is needed and I propose to consult urgently on this with a view toincorporating a suitable provision in the Bill.FURTHER CONSULTATIONS15*      These proposals would require immediate consultations with industry0nly on SLADE and on repealing the Press Charter.    If we proceed asProposed on union expulsion, I need not consult further on that until thedraft Code of Practice is prepared.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALRECOMMENDATIONS16.I invite my colleagues to agree that we should:i. Give a right to compensation for unfair dismissal, in thecontext of a closed shop, to those who object to membership ofany union whatsoever or of a particular union provided that thegrounds of objection are religious, ethical or moral (paragraph 5).ii. Make clear, through guidance in the draft closed shop Codeof Practice, our intention that it shall normally be regarded asunreasonable behaviour if a union expels a member solely on suchgrounds as that he has crossed a picket line or refused to take partin unconstitutional industrial action (paragraph 9).iii. Consult the newspaper industry on the proposal to reinforcethe effect of i. and ii. by incorporating a separate section on thatindustry in the draft statutory Code; and on that basis repeal theineffective provision for a Press Charter (paragraphs 11-12).iv. Consult industry on the remedy needed to curb objectionableunion recruitment activities of the SLADE type (paragraph 14).J PDepartment of Employment12 October 19794CONFIDENTIAL
