CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 60 COPY NO10 December 1979CABINETPAY AND PRICE PROVISIONS FOR THE 1980-81 CASH LIMITSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. The 1980-81 cash limits on the Rate Support Grant (RSG) and theexternal financing limits on the nationalised industries were announced on16 November.    We now need to take decisions on the pay and price provisionsin the Main Estimates for 1980-81 and in the other remaining cash limits.A. EXPENDITURE CONCERNED2. These are the limits on central Government expenditure and on localauthority capital expenditure.    They cover over  25 billion (at 1979 Surveyprices).    The main areas of central Government expenditure include defence,the hospital and community health service and the universities.    The limitscover numerous pay groups principally the Armed Forces, doctors, nurses,National Health Service ancillaries and university staff.3. At this stage, we can leave on one side Civil Service pay:  a globalprovision for the Civil Service pay settlement is to be made in a single Votewhich need not be decided until February.B. PROVISION4. I propose that provision should be made for a 14 per cent increasebetween 1979-80 and 1980-81 in current costs covering both new pay awardsand other current expenditure.    This differs from past practice when aseparate factor was used for pay and two other factors for the remainder ofcurrent expenditure but it follows the approach we agreed for the RSG. Theadvantage of the RSG approach is that it avoids publishing an explicit figure forpay which could become a starting point for negotiations.5. I propose continuing past practice of using snparate price factors forcapital expenditure.    Separate provision would be made for the outstandingcomparability awards for the university teachers and for nurses.    All theproposed factors are shown in Annex A.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6. These factors are based on the Industry Act forecast whiah showed a14 per cent increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI) between the fourth quarterof 1979 and the fourth quarter of 1980.    They are also broadly in line with thefigures supplied to the Government Actuary;  these showed the same increasein the RPI and a 14 per cent increase in earnings between 1979-80 and 1980-81for the economy as a whole (see Annex B).7. As part of the RSG settlement, the local authorities were given afigure of 13 per cent for increases in the costs of their current expendituregenerally.    This cash limit represents a maximum contribution from thecentral Government.    We can justify the slightly higher figures of 14 per centfor central Government cash limits on the grounds that for each centralGovernment service the cash limit is an absolute constraint whereas localauthorities have greater flexibility and, in the last resort, their own balancesto fall back on if inflation turns oat higher than expected.C.    IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PLANS8. We cannot, consistently with our own published forecasts, make ahigher provision than now proposed. And it is essential, in our first fullyear, to hold expenditure within the cash limits we set.9. The effect of the cash limits on services will depend both on inflationgenerally and on public service pay settlements.    If these costs increasefaster than provided for, the cash limit will be bound to result in furtherreductions in the volume of expenditure.    The size of these will depend onthe mix of different types of expenditure on each service.10. Any forecasts of inflation are inevitably subject to a wide margin oferror, but it would be unrealistic if my colleagues do not allow for thepossibility that the cash limits will require some further reduction in thevolume of the services for which they are responsible in 1980-81. Allspending authorities must manage their resources throughout the financialyear in such a way that they keep within the cash limits even if costs risefaster than provided.CONCLUSION11.
