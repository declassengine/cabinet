CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 5329 October 1979CABINETREVIEW OF THE OPERATION OF VEHICLE EXCISE DUTYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Energy1. Petrol accounts for nearly a quarter of our oil consumption andhigher taxes on petrol will be essential if we are to restrain oil consumptionand give an incentive for high miles per gallon motoring, as other nationsare doing and as is anyway required by our Tokyo and other commitmentson oil demand restraint.    We are also committed to securing staff savings,wherever possible, in public administration.2. The report frcm officials brings out the clear advantages of VehicleExcise Duty (VED) abolition in terms of energy conservation and of staffsavings.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s main concern is that one taxmay prove a less reliable revenue raising option than two.    I am notpersuaded.    First, VED is already subject to a substantial level of evasion.This can at best only be contained, or marginally reduced, by employingmore staff and committing more resources.    Secondly, if the Chancellorof the Exchequer seeks greater indirect tax revenues than would flow fromthe specific abolition proposals before us, there is ample scope forincreasing the petrol duty as necessary.    Both tax on petrol and pumpprices in the United Kingdom are still the lowest in the European EconomicCommunity (EEC).    Moreover, within the EEC Germany has alreadydecided to abolish vehicle excise and others are considering doing so.3. I, therefore, urge colleagues to agree that we should now abolishVED, in the interests of energy conservation, of more efficientadministration and of incentive to our motor and related industries tomaintain technological advance.D HDepartment of Energy29 October 1979COPY NOCONFIDENTIAL
