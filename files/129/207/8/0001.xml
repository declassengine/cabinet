CONFIDENTIALOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 38 COP? NO7 September 1979CABINETFURTHER ACTION TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE CIVIL SERVICEMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilINTRODUCTION1. At Cabinet on 31 May (CC(79) 4th Conclusions, Minute 6) I was askedto bring forward proposals for reducing the size and cost of the CivilService by April 1982.     Our intention was to do this by improvingefficiency and dropping tasks.     Departmental Ministers were accordinglyinvited to show what they would have to do by these methods to reduce theirexpenditure on Civil Service wages and salaries and related items by 10, 15and 20 per cent below the present level.    This interim report comments onthe returns which colleagues have sent me, invites views on two mainquestions and proposes next steps.SUMMARY OF THE RETURNS2. The returns varied widely.    Not all Ministers identified optionscovering the full range of percentages.    As requested, they categorisedtheir options by degree of difficulty.    This is what the categories amountto:-Savings in 1982-83 m    % of Total Staffi.       Improved efficiency and lesswaste 24 0. 5 4,900plus ii.      Positively desirable orrelatively painless 175 4.1 37,900plus iii.     Some adverse effect on policyand level of service 331 7. 7 65, 000plus iv.      Requiring major and difficultpolitical decisions* 695 16.2 124,400*Sorne options were presented as both requiring major and difficult decisionsi d being positively desirable.     They are here included in category ii. only.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALBut that table by itself gives too optimistic a picture.    All Ministers sentcovering letters indicating limits on what they felt able to do.    These limitswere more restrictive than the table suggests,  in particular many items incategory iii. were regarded as very difficult indeed.    Annex 1 sets out thebasic figures for each Department with a brief summary of what mycolleagues said about them.3.        Looking at the total picture, the best assessment I can make at thisstage of what is said to be achievable without too great pain is an overallsaving of between 6 and 7 per cent, and by no means the whole of thatcomes from improved efficiency and dropping tasks.    Efficiency accountsfor about \ per cent and dropping tasks for about 4f per cent.     The otherlj per cent or so comes from retaining tasks but locating them outside theCivil Service - in the private sector or elsewhere in the public sector, egby using contractors or consultants to do work now done by civil servants.The best offer among the major Departments in terms of improvedefficiency and dropping tasks amounted to 15 per cent;  the worst \ per cent.The overall outcome is frankly disappointing;   I find it hard to believe that,where tasks are concerned, we must regard as essential no less than95 per cent of the work the last Labour Government thought fit to undertake.THE AIM OF THE EXERCISE4. The money savings shown in the table in paragraph 2 are gross andtake no account of the offsetting costs, which come eg from putting workout and which were not included in the returns.    This points up a generalquestion about the aim of the exercise.5. Our objective surely is to reduce not only the size of the CivilService but also the cost of government.    They do not necessarily go hand-in-hand.    If we put work out (as opposed to dropping it), it still has to bepaid for; it may then cost less, much the same, or more.    If we drop orcurtail work of which the cost is fully covered by fees and charges, we savestaff but do not save money.    We can also reduce both the size and the costof the Civil Service, but in ways which result in less collected in revenue ormore paid out in benefits.    This problem is set out in greater detail in thenote by officials at Annex 2.    In effect, we can make a higher percentagesaving in numbers than we can in money.6-        That is not necessarily wrong;  a reduction in the weight of thebureaucracy is a legitimate objective in its own right.    I do not regard theactivities of revenue-collecting or benefit-paying, or those that wash theirfaces financially, as sacrosanct.    Over-government can be as burdensomethere as anywhere else;  and my colleagues will recall that we explicitlyundertook to seek economies in the cost of running the tax and socialsecurity systems in our Election Manifesto.    I propose therefore that weshould be prepared to accept some options which save numbers even ifthey do not produce equivalent savings in money.    But it would not make2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsense, in my view, to put work out where that costs more than having itdone by civil servants;  we should only do so where there is a reasonableprima facie expectation that it will cost less.7. We must also bear in mind staff reactions and staff morale. Whereputting work out is more economical, there is a convincing case for doing itwhich the staff may dislike but will have to accept.    But where it costsmore it largely loses its point where the Government is concerned, willlook like dogma from outside, and will arouse resentment among staff.The phasing of some reductions will also be important here.    Any large-scale redundancies will involve heavy payments which could, with otheroffsetting costs, turn profit into loss over the first few years.    They willalso exacerbate the problem of morale.    So the more we proceed by usingnatural wastage, the better.THE PROSPECTSFORA LARGE REDUCTION8. Even if we count all the options that, involve putting work out? thereis a wide gap between what Ministers have said they think feasible in theirown Departments and what I think most of us would regard as an acceptableoutcome generally.    My judgment is that with a considerable further heave,and a good deal of pain and grief, the 6-7 per cent I have mentioned could beincreased to somewhere around 10 per cent.    I have little doubt that theCabinet as a whole will find this disappointing.    But if we feel that we mustset our sights much above 10 per cent, I am bound to say now that thereturns do not offer any reasonable prospect of getting there.    If that isour objective, we shall all have to think again about our options in a muchmore radical way.9. Let me illustrate the sort of change that colleagues tell me 10 percent would mean, among other things, within their Departments:a. In the Ministry of Defence, reducing or even abandoningDepartmental procedures to ensure that goods purchased meetrequired quality standards.b. In the Department of Employment, withdrawing the option ofclaimants to go on getting their unemployment benefit weekly ratherthan under the new fortnightly system.c. In the Inland Revenue, lifting by 20 per cent the minimumincome levels at which the various rates of tax become payable.d. In the Department of Health and Social Security, makingemployers responsible for paying sick pay during the first sixweeks of illness in place of sickness benefit from the State; andintroducing a unified housing benefit scheme which brings togetherthe housing benefits at present administered separately by the3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALDepartment of Health and Social Security (under the supplementarybenefits scheme) and by local authorities (in the form of rent andrate rebates).I think we must be prepared to take decisions of this sort;  if not, there isno choice but to lower our sights.10. The numerical gearing of the big Departments is crucial. TheMinistry of Defence (245, 000), the Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot;s bigDepartments, Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and the Department forNational Savings (together 123, 000) and the Department of Health andSocial Security (98, 000) account for 64 per cent of the Civil Service. TheSecretary of State for Defence has felt unable to go beyond 3 per cent gross,pending longer-term studies to produce bigger savings;   while theChancellor of the Exchequer has offered staff savings of around 6 per cent.The Secretary of State for Social Services has made a notably higher offerof 11 per cent.     But even with this, the aggregate score for the three&quot;giants&quot; together is only 5. 5 per cent.11. The effect of this gearing is that it is clearly not possible for theother Departments in aggregate to raise the percentage for the Service asa whole much above the percentage the &quot;giants&quot; produce.    These otherDepartments, moreover, include some areas of especial difficulty, egprisons and special hospitals, though some others can see their way tomaking savings in excess of 10 per cent.12. We should not therefore underestimate the size of the task. Icannot yet say firmly that 10 per cent is on.    But I do not believe that mycolleagues will regard a lower figure as an acceptable outcome, and Irecommend that we should aim to put together a package of this size. Butcolleagues must be in no doubt about what that requires.    If the HomeSecretary and perhaps one or two others have to offer less than 10 per centthe rest must find more, and a heavy responsibility will rest on those incharge of large Departments.    It will mean a determined commitment onthe part of each of us to find the very most he can.NEXT STEPS13. If that is agreed I suggest that I and my Minister of State, togetherwith a Treasury Minister, should now hold bilateral discussions withcolleagues to agree with them the maximum contribution they can make. Iwill then make a further report to Cabinet next month.LEGISLATIONA number of the options which may be adopted would requirelegislation.    This could affect the pace at which we achieve the savings.shall be in a better position to report what is involved when the bilateralshave been completed.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALEXPENDITURE IN 1980-8115. We agreed on 23 July (CC(79) 11th Conclusions) to begin thesediscussions on Civil Service manpower on the assumption that a sizablefirst tranche would be found in 1980-81.    It will be helpful therefore ifcolleagues can indicate how much of their total saving will be achievablenext year.    In this context it is essential that all Departments should carrythrough into 1980-81 the reduction in staff costs which have been made inadjusting this year&apos;s cash limits - and they will need to do better than that.PROPOSALS FOR INCREASED EXPENDITURE16. For some Departments, the existing plans provide for increasedmanpower expgnditure between 1979-80 and 1982-83.    Since the purpose ofthe present exercise is to secure reductions in manpower below the 1979-80level, it will be necessary for Departments to forgo these increases. Apartfrom the few additional bids already approved by Cabinet, we mayexceptionally have to allow some margin for demand-led increases, eg as aresult of higher unemployment.    But these increases must be kept to anabsolute minimum and I propose that they should be subject to the specificapproval of Civil Service Department Ministers.    We shall have to findroom for anything else by dropping work of lower priority.STAFF MORALE AND STAFF SIDE ATTITUDES17. We must have a care for staff morale.    The points I have referredto in paragraph 7 will be among the more important here.    I am seeing theNational Staff Side before the Cabinet meets eo that they cannot accuse us oftaking decisions before giving them a hearing.RECOMMENDATIONS18. I invite my colleagues to agree that:a. Less then 10 per cent would not be an acceptable outcome, andwe should aim at a package of cuts amounting to 10 per cent inaggregate (paragraphs 8 and 12).b. To achieve this Ministers in charge of the largestDepartments must contribute their full share of this 10 per centpackage, and each of us must make a determined effort to findmore (paragraph 12).c. A sizable first tranche should be found in 1980-81(paragraph 15).d. Plans for further increases in staff expenditure must beforgone save exceptionally where the specific approval of CivilService Department Ministers has been sought and obtained(paragraph 16).5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALe. We should go for savings from putting work out only wherethere is a reasonable expectation that it will cost less(paragraph 6).f. We should seek so to phase reductions as to minimiseredundancy (paragraph 7)0g. My Minister of State and I, with the help of a TreasuryMinister, should conduct bilateral discussions with certaincolleagues on the lines set out above, after which I should report tothe Cabinet again in October (paragraph 13).SCivil Service Department7 September 1979CONFIDENTIAL6

Two other significantfeatures are, firstly, abandoning tasks and lowering standards of^rvice; and secondly, switching work from civilian to serviceJrsonnel (which, however, the Secretary of State does not regard aslalistic on any appreciable scale).   Studies, taking from 3 to: months, are to be put in hand to validate, in particular, theope for savings in three major areas:-a. The work of the R&amp;D establishments (29,000 staff in12 establishments);b. Armed Forces provisioning - an extension of a currentRayner study;c    The future role, organisation and structure of the RoyalDockyards, in the light of future needs of the Navy and thecapacity of UK industry.*    In advance of the outcome of these, and other studies offoposals for abandoning tasks and lowering standards of service,8 Secretary of State cannot foreoast with certainty what savings&amp;fi be secured in these areas.CONFIDENTIAL

The Options to achieve a 10$ level of cuts include 2 majorsocial security measures - the transfer to employers of responsibilitySor sick pay in the first 6 weeks, and the introduction of a UnifiedHousing Benefit.   The balance is made up by a number of smaller SSsimplifications, and measures to reduce headquarters staff dealingwith the NHS and local authorities.3. Options to achieve a 15$ level of cut would involve theintroduction of a simplified scheme for the first 13 weeks ofSupplementary Benefit; making National Insuranoe Contributions fromthe self-employed voluntary; increasing Child Benefit to sufficientlevels to enable national insurance short-term child dependencyallowances to be phased out; and further disengagement from the NHS,*ocal authorities and the medical supplies industry,   Savings at the185^level would include abolishing all Supplementary Benefit home isiting, abolishing married womens&apos; reserved rights to continueP^ing reduced national insurance contributions, and deferring allbenefit upratings until 1983.   A number of functions on the Healthf^de of the department would be abolished or transferred to the NHS.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. The Social Services Secretary considers that cuts beyond at11$ would not be feasible, although it might be possible to gofurther on the HPSS side later.   A number of social securityoptions beyond 10$ involve sizeable benefit oosts.   Some of theaoptions, or variants of them, were also considered in the PESexercise for 1980/81 but none were then agreed.   Certain HPSSoptions would transfer staff to other parts of the public seotoiand might not lead to net savings overall.5. No savings are offered to off-set growth in the PES baseliowhich in 1982-83 amounts to some 5,000 man years ( 16 million)above 1979-80 adjusted levels. The PES growth is largely due toforecast increases in demand for benefits, and the Secretary ofState for Social Services is not prepared to find additional offsetting savings on this account. Ministers have also agreed into net additional manpower bids of nearly 2,000 man years for D&quot;in 1980/81. The extra staff are needed to cope with further gioin the demand for benefits, especially because of revisedunemployment forecasts, and for additional fraud work.CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALANNEX 2NUMBERS AND COSTS(Note by Officials)A number of the identified options for savings highlight a problemon which Ministers will need to reach a view.   The options concernedare those which reduce Civil Service staff numbers but where thereis no corresponding saving in Civil Service costs; or where, althoughthere is a corresponding saving in Civil Service costs, a cost istransferred to some other part of the public sector.    In such cases,the responses made by Ministers have generally shown the moneysaving accruing from stopping the payment of the wages and salariesof civil servants.   They have not shown the offsetting costs.2. This issue can take a number of different forms.   The mostimportant instance (because it appears to involve the most moneyand has significant industrial relations implications) relates towhat has been called &quot;privatisation&quot;, that is, transferring tothe private sector work which is currently performed by civil servantsSuch transfers reflect the Manifesto commitment to reduce bureaucracyand over-government.   Where the function is transferred wholly tothe private sector and the Government retains no further interest init (for example, transferring some job placement to private employmentagencies), the gain is clear cut.    Civil Service numbers and costsare both reduced fully and there are no offsetting costs.3. Different considerations arise, however, where a function mustremain the full responsibility of a government department but it isProposed that the work required should be performed by outsidecontractors, consultants,  etc instead of by civil servants - for examplelDy putting cleaning and maintenance of government offices out tocontract.   This will enable a reduction to be made in Civil Servicestaff, and their wages and salaries will be saved.   But the outsidecontractor will have to be paid.   Moreover, if the civil servantspreviously performed the work had to be made redundant, therecould be a substantial cost to the Superannuation Vote by way ofCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALredundancy payments.   The question is: as part of the Goverameaof cutting back the public sector, should work be moved out evthough it can be done no cheaper in the private sector, or shothis be done only where it results in a net saving in publicexpenditure?4. A rather different question arises where the cost of work pby civil servants is met by fee income or receipts (for exampleissue of passports, land registration, driving tests). In suchstopping the work or transferring it to the private sector woulresult in a saving of staff but a corresponding loss of receipt(which might be greater than the cost of the wages and salariessaved). In this area, it may be essential that the work shouldcontinue to be performed within government; but where this isnthe case, the only constraints would seem to be the significancany net loss of income from receipts and of any new costs whichmight arise from, for example, a need to monitor the effectiveperformance by the private sector of the function transferred.5. A further cateory relates to the stopping of work by civilservants which would then have to be done elsewhere in thepublic sector.   Options of this kind would save Civil Service swith a corresponding reduction in Civil Service costs and wouldgenerally mean that work would be located in the area which maddirect use of it.   There is a risk, however, that the work mighnot be done so economically and, to ensure that it was, thepresumption might be made that no additional expenditure wouldapproved for the work which was taken on.6. Finally, there are a few cases where a saving in Civil Servstaff and staff costs could result in a   reduction in revenue ror in higher payments (authorised or otherwise).   There cangeneral rule for such cases: the answer must depend both onbalance of savings and costs and on the particular merits oiproposed change.CONFIDENTIAL
