2. The Conservative Manifesto included a firm commitment toreduce the total level of Government activity and to making thactivity which remains efficient:&quot;The State takes too much of the nation1s income; itsshare must be steadily reduced..... The reduction ofwaste, bureaucracy and over-government will also yieldsubstantial savings.&quot;    (pages 8 and 9)3. The media have given expression to public feeling aboutbureaucracy at all levels and will continue to do so. Todisappoint the expectations aroused would confirm the view ofthat the bureaucracy will always wear out the new broomsThe way forward4. There are two main ways in which Ministers can enablethemselves to do what is really important and stop thesquandering of staff and other resources. First, each Ministereduce the number and scale of his departmental activities whethis does not impair the country&apos;s health and wealth. Second,can improve the methods by which that activity is carried out.5. My general recommendations to achieve those aims are thatMinisters should -a. regularly review the scale and the efficiency oftheir operations;b. regularly review the cost of their overheads; andc. develop their management function in respect ofthe resources placed in their charge, eg through aflow of key information needed to monitor the use ofstaff and other departmental facilities.It is relevant to c. above that the &quot;Rayner project&quot; (seeparagraph 6 below) suggested by the Secretary of State for theEnvironment for his Department concerns an improved system forprovision of management information to Ministers but also tha.Ministers and their officials would not be starting from cola;the Government adopted the programme I recommend: it would rabe a matter of developing from existing techniques of appraisthe cost of operations.A programme of action6. In your Minute to Ministers of 4 June on the Rayner 1*you commissioned a series of projects on functions or activ-which might be unnecessary or too costly and wasteful. ^ &apos;likely that some major reorganisation proposals will emerge
projects now under way in the Departments.    I have kept inhwith a number of officials engaged on this work and haveable to see at first hand how some of the work is done, whichles me to say with confidence at this stage that there will hebrtunities of substantial savings in staff in some areas and aiderable simplification of the way work is carried out.Such reforms will be more obvious to the public and tolament than general reforms in respect of, say, thegement of the Civil Service, important as those will be (seegraph 23 below).    A programme of action which permitssters to make regular announcements that activities have beenped? reduced or reformed will do much to convince the publicthe Government not only means but is in business.I recommend that the programme of action should include -a.    Tests of specific functions to establish whetheractivity is still necessary at all, whether theintended purposes can be achieved through less activityand whether there is duplication of the activity ofother Departments or agencies, for example, whetherGovernment needs all the statistics it collects;whether the procurement of non-warlike stores by andon behalf of. the Armed Forces can be furtherrationalised; and whether the organisation andmethods by which social security and unemploymentbenefits are delivered can be further simplified.b. Tests of ways of /doing things, for examplewhether in collecting the revenue or deliveringsocial security we make effective use of staff andenable them to feel loyalty and commitment.c. Tests of the cost of running the Government, forexample of housing, furnishing, equipping it and so on.Anyr qu.e thee donavity eprodi -inaticher thtifiedht byly oronsibiIfied;ctive5icrutiny of how a a department does its job begs theition of whyTt does it.    This means looking at policy,questions &quot;Does the job need to be done at all?&quot; and &quot;Canmore efficiently?&quot; are logically inseparable. Anyshould be regarded as disposable or improvable if it doese a benefit worth having at the price paid for it. Thems I recommend should therefore be designed to showie policy objectives of expenditure are clearly1 and are still valid, in effect whether the activitythe expenditure is one that the Government must carry out,partly; what is the cost of the activity; whether thelitres and accountability of staff are clearlyand whether activity is so carried out as to achieve itseffectively and economically.   Activities engaging large3
numbers of staff offer obvious scope for such examination not ]suggest, with the simple intention of reducing numbers but of&apos;establishing whether the activity is conducted effectively. jj,terms of staff morale&apos;it is important to make clear thatsimplifying or mechanising or computerising work improve both tlservice and the satisfaction of staff delivering it.   In all arjof work, it is important that the scrutiny should be seen not a]accusatory or inquisitorial, but as seeking in the general publlinterest thoughtful contributions from staff.    This wouldacknowledge that responsible Civil Servants want to delivercost-effective services and also that line managers are alreadyIexpected and should be further-encouraged to recommend ways inwhich the resources in their cL-rge can be better used.10. The programme will&quot; serve its purpose only when action istaken as a result of examination.    It should not therefore beallowed to become too formal or bureaucratic.    That said, Ienvisage that the first year&apos;s scrutinies should be conducted calpilot basis, taking into account experience with the &quot;Raynerprojects&quot; now under way, so that methods and procedures for the Isecond year can be considered in the light of experience,, Inorder to give my general recommendations substance and to takeaccount of the points made above, I meke the following detailed Irecommendations.Scrutiny of overheads11. I recommend that each Minister in charge of a Depa2&apos;-tinentshould, at the appropriate point in the PESC/Estimates cycle,scrutinise the overheads^ of his Department as well as his staff]costs and that for this purpose he should make one of hisMinisterial team responsible for an annual examination of therelevant expenditures.   A regular flow of management informatioiabout the use of resources will be essential for this and I shaloffer advice in due course, eg on the importance of reviewingpast performance and of informed realism in setting targets forthe future.Scrutiny of specific functions12. I recommend that in order to increase their Department.1 siefficiency and effectiveness, Ministers should examine in detailduring the course of each year specific functions and theassociated use of staff, administrative expenditure and overneai* The footnote on page 1 details the overheads additional to -1costs. I shall - &apos;. want to comment on the general question 1repayment for common services now provided on &quot;allied serv Pterms in my &quot;conventions&quot; project (see paragraph 23 belowi-
3.   The Civil Service has traditional means of examining work,taff inspection and 0 &amp; MV   While these have an important placethe programme, I believe that they should be ancillary to a newuproach.   The basic1 questions to be asked are, &quot;What value is added&apos;o the public good and to efficient administration, by thisctivity (or procedure, or practice or convention)?   Should it beept at all?   What has constrained or now constrains greaterffectiveness?&quot;   For this purpose, I recommend that Ministershould employ some of their ablest officials to scrutinise theelected activity radically and searchingly.    I do not envisagehat there should be more than one or two officials for mostcrutinies, but they should be able to call upon the Departmentsesourees to help; I generally oppose the committee style in workf this kind.Ths number of scrutinies to be conducted by Ministers each-ear depends on the size and character of each Department. Iecomnead that each. Department should have at least one a year andhax the executive and larger departments should have, say, threerfour a year; no Department should be automatically excluded.5. Ttfccordjar frcirectlhe delrich ahat ea;re aregeneiiEdustreneralp exeskrposts scale and nature of subjects for scrutiny will varyag to the functions of departments.    The most obvious butm the only topics will be likely in Departments bearingy on the public, eg through the collection of revenue orivery of benefits or employment and training services, inreas several issues have been raised with me.    I recommendriy scrutinies be mounted in such areas.    Similarly, thereas of interface or overlap or duplication with other8., particularly local government and the nationalisedies; I recommend that exercises be done here also, with theintention of reducing such duplication or double-bankingsive monitoring as may be found and of clarifying theand method of such activity as may be necessary.P*   In order to make for consistency as between Departments and toBentify subjects which affect the interest of more than onemister, I recommend that the programme of each year&apos;sfrutirues should be decided upon after you have been informed ofet?ro^?sa-Ls for it.    To begin with, I recommend the submission.0 !   .&apos;jKt Pilot proposals, and the notification of arrangements1 0! l;^e under my recommendations in paragraphs 11 - 15 above,J &apos;j November.^Uo^be played by the central DepartmentsST)  1 -   commend that the central Departments (HM Treasury, thearts-   th  Cablllet Office (CFRS)) should play the followingqJr ^ile OSD, with such assistance from the Treasury andas may be appropriate, should prepare for you ands
for Cabinet an annual statement on the cost ofGovernment, dealing in particular with the mainelements of costi with movements in them and withmatters on which the collective interest of seniorMinisters should be brought to bear.    This mightmost conveniently be done as part of the PESCprocess, with the statement being considered atsome time in the period July-October.b. The CSD should collate for you the proposalsmade by Ministers in charge of departments for ,rscrutinies (see paragraph 16 above) with a view toadvising you and senior Ministers whether the mostimportant subjects are included; whether the annualprogramme is coherent across departments; howproblems (identified by departments or the centralDepartments) which span the interests of more thanone Minister should be handled; and also with a viewto your indicating those scrutinies in which theintended outcome should be reported to you.c. The CSD, HM Treasury and CPRS should beauthorised to associate themselves with particularscrutinies and to suggest ones additional oralternative to those proposed by Departments. (Thedegree of &quot;association&quot; would vary according tocircumstances between appointing staff to join in anexercise and receiving and commenting on the draft-report.    The purposes of &quot;association&quot; would be tclend support when necessary; to promote consistencyof treatment as between Departments; and to ensurethat points of concern to the Minister for the CivilService and the Chancellor of the Exchequer wereproperly reflected in the programme of action.)d. The CSD, with such assistance from the Treasury andCPRS as may be appropriate, should be authorised, whethe;jointly with them or on its own, to carry out scrutiniesof particular activities in collaboration with theDepartments concerned and to report to you and to theMinisters in charge of those Departments.e. -The CSD should continue with its programme ofiassignments, some of which are interdepartmental incharacter, aimed at producing quantifiable savings (egin transport, office support services, office machineryand in general &quot;cost consciousness&quot;), but the programmeof work for each year should be approved by you in yoU-capacity   as Minister for the Civil Service.Programme Analysis and Review; Management Review18.    The last Conservative Administration introduced new fota-
examination, Programme Analysis and Review and Management Review.Despite the goodwill which has gone into the design and conduct ofPAR, it has become over formal and cumbersome in procedure, hasnot engaged and kept the truly collective interest of eitherMinisters or officials and has tended to produce reports which aretoo bulky, tardy and impracticable.   As for management review, youhave indicated that the planned reviews of the Ministry of-Agriculture and the Overseas Development Administration shouldproceed, but that you would need to be convinced that they producepositive results before authorising further reviews.    In my view,the scrutinies I envisage would render the PAR approachunnecessary and I think that it could cease without serious loss-they might replace management reviews in their present form, but&apos;I should like to offer you advice on this next Spring, inconsultation with the Ministers and senior officials concerned.Publicity19.   I recommend that&apos; the main features of the programme of actionshould os announced as early as possible, together with examples:f the areas which are the first to be examined.20. IIannouncflecisiehave bsnain polong-terole of3implj ifcommittchalltrmay be objected to this that.it would be far better toe specific changes, savings or reforms.    In fact, theas on public expenditure and Civil Service manpower willm announced by the time the programme is ready.    But theint to emphasise is that &quot;his Administration is committed tom reform and that this means developing the managerialMinisters; looking for further savings by eliminating,; ing or rationalising areas of work; and taking the time anding the effort to identify these savings, not least byfing past conventions.ESii^^shins with other exercisesf1.

23. My project on the conventions of Whitehall which discouor inhib.it the effective management of business and resourceMinisters^, an outline of which I shall let you have shortlycomplementary to the programme. Its main purpose is to makerecommendations aimed at strengthening the capacity of Ministo manage their Departments. It is likely to be completed nSpring.Finding the right people for top management jobs24. In conclusion, no organisational changes nor improvemenmethods will, by themselves, ensure lasting success. The 0I know to get to grips with a complex activity is to put sonin charge whose background and experience suggest that he/shqualified to do the job. This is one of the messages of reccriticism of the Service; I saw it when I was last in Whitenand I am seeing it again now.25. Managers will not be motivated to show initiative in brdown costs and eliminating waste, unless promotion and reco^follow success. Their staff will not be inspired to do bettjunless they understand what their tasks are for and can respjtheir leaders. Those leaders must not merely take an interejtheir suggestions and complaints but actively promote theconditions necessary to the delivery of services in a manner]inspires loyalty, pride and commitment. Things go wrong ifoutstanding middle managers are passed over by the promotion!top positions of people without management experiences or witinterest in the work which will be directed by them in theirjappointment.26. I intend to pursue the questions of appointments to senmanagement posts and of related matters during my project onl&quot;conventions&quot; in consultation with the CSD and other DepartMRAYNER/&apos;30 August 1979Your Minute of 4 June, paragraph (b) on page 1
