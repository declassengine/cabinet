CONFIDENTIALCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 4723 October 1979CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT SETTLEMENT 1980-81Memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department1. This paper is about the Rate Support Grant for 1980-81 and variousrelated matters.    They have been discussed in a Ministerial Group(MLSC 21) under my chairmanship.    They are due to be announced on16 November (Scotland) and 20 November (England and Wales).   The RateSupport Grant (RSG), and the level of rates next year, is always apolitically sensitive subject.    But this year there is the added complicationof using the cash limit on the RSC in a new way to influence local authoritywage settlements.    This is the last year of the present RSG arrangementfor England and Wales:  for the next settlement, the new Unitary Grantsystem should be operating.    Annex A describes the present system.Annex B explains the proposed Unitary Grant on which agreement has nowbeen reached by the Ministers concerned.2. Increase Order for 1978-79.   Annex C describes the system ofincrease orders.    For 1978-79 there is no problem.    MISC 21 agreesthat the sums remaining within the cash limits for 1978-79 should be paidout, subject to agreement among officials on the exact  gures.3. 1979-80 Increase Orders.    There are two related problems here.Normally the sum to be paid for 1979/80 would also be determined by thecash limit set a year ago.    But our predecessors set the cash limit too low.We agreed before the 3udget to make an adjustment for additional wagecosts, but to abate it by at least  300 million, with provision for furtherpossible changes when the results of awards were known.    It was sub*sequently also agreed by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategythat a further  20 million offsetting savings should be sought because of thecost of the Clegg awards, and the wish to apply pressure on managementfor increased efficiency in the use of local authority majaual labour. TheSecretary of State for the Environment has offered to find  10 million onother local authority programmes, notably housing and to abate the increaseorder by a further  10 million to cover the balance.    The Chief Secretary,Treasury, accepts this compromise and the Group agrees to recommend itto Cabinet.1COPY NOCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4.        There is also the related question of the cost, in 1979-80, of theexpected Clegg recommendation on teachers, craftsmen, and the jointlocal authority/union study of the pay of Administrative, Professional,Technical and Clerical grades.   The main settlement for the manualsis due at the beginning of November 1979 and its costs up to the end ofthis financial year will have to be included in this increase order. Thecost to central government, on the present RSG percentage, is put atbetween  130 million and  150 million.    The Group agrees in principlethat the Government should meet this cost without further abatement, andsuggests that the exact figure should be settled at official level.50        1980-81 RSG Percentage.   Turning to the current settlement, theSecretary of State for the Environment proposes that the RSG percentagefor 1980-81 should be 61 per cent as in the present year.    The ChiefSecretary, Treasury, has argued for a reduction to 59 per cent. A61 per cent grant should allow average rate increases to be held to about15 per cent;  a 59 per cent grant indicates a rate rise of around 21 per cent(fuller figures are set out in Annex D).    A 61 per cent grant, coupled witha realistic cash limit (see paragraph 7 below) meet the Governmentsprevious share of expenditure levels and would thus clearly shift the burdenof responsibility for higher rate increases from central to local government.A reduction in grant might impose either increases in rates and/or a furthervolume squeeze on local government expenditure, and invalidate the basison which Departments have negotiated with local authorities since thesummer.    But it would be consistent with our wish to reduce the level ofcentral government expenditure and diminish the burden of taxation andpublic sector borrowing.    Without a reduction in grant percentage thereis a danger that actual local authority expenditure will exceed the plansapproved by Cabinet.    The Group was unable to reach an agreed recoesnmenda-tion on the percentage, but the majority would favour a percentage somewhathigher than 59 per cent.6.        1980-81 Distribution Formula.    The RSG percentage cannot bedivorced from the question of the distribution formula.    Broadly speakinga 61 per cent RSG would slightly reverse the present drift away from theShire counties.    At 60. 5 per cent grant the overall position of the Shiresis held constant in terms of their share of the grant.    However, as Annex Fshows, 33 of the 47 Shires would lose grant in real terms compared withlast year.    At 60 per cent or any lower percentage the drift continues.There is no defensible way, within the existing formula, of improving theseshares;  and no justification for varying them arbitrarily by altering theformula in the last year of the present RSG system.    Figures are set outin Annex E; Annex F sets out the likely effects for individual authorities for61 per cent, 60. 5 per cent, 60 per cent and 59 per cent,    The Group waskeenly aware of the poHtical need to halt this drift if possible, but the ChiefSecretary still wishes to recommend that the grant should be reduced to59 per cent.    However, the whole Group recommends that the presentdistribution formula should be retained, whatever percentage grant isagreed.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7. 1980-81 Cash Limit.    Cabinet has already decided upon the volumeof local authority expenditure next year.    The problem is to translate thisinto cash terms.    What increase in wages and prices should be assumedfor this purpose?    The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy hasagreed that the cash limits for next year should make !realistic but notextravagant&apos; allowance for pay increases.    As in the remainder of 1979-80,allowance must be made for the costs of the Clegg and other comparabilityawards already in the pipeline, and for those on which recommendationsare expected before next April.    The Chief Secretary has assumed thatcomparability awards yet to come will increase local authority costs byabout 6 per cent in 1980-81 over 1979-80.    Eut in addition, the 1980-81figures must include some allowance for prices and for settlements in thecurrent wage round and the one beginning in August 1980.    The ChiefSecretary has assumed that public sector pay will move broadly in line withwages in the private sector and on that basis expects that the increase inlocal authority costs from price movements and pay settlements will beabout 14. 6 per cent in 1980-81 over 1979-80.    To allow for some furtherimprovements in efficiency in local authority services he proposes roundingthis figure down to 13 par cent.8. The majority of the Group believes that this provision is unrealistic-ally low.    The current rate of price inflation is over 17.0 per cent. Thisfigure has been widely publicised, and it is (wrongly) believed to be the ratewhich the Government is prepared to see in the nationalised industries.The majority consider that the current rate of price inflation, rather thanthe expected movement in wages averaged over next year, will determinethe key local authority pay settlements to be reached in the next six months.The Secretary of State for the Environment proposes an inflation allowanceof 17. 5 per cent which he would be prepared to shade down to 16. 5 per cent,for the same reasons as the Chief Secretary, in order to give authoritiesan incentive to seek further operating economies.    The Group also notedthat the negotiations for the local authority manual workers&apos; pay settlementare closely linked to those of the National Health Service Ancillaries.    It iseven more important to set a realistic pay assumption for this group becausethe Health Authorities have not got the safety-valve of rate increases if payexceeds the forecast figure.9. 1980-81: General.    The Cabinet will have to reach an overall judg-ment which balances all these factors.    Annex D shows, as clearly aspossible, the relationship between them.    The rate increases shown are ofcourse only arithmetical consequences of the various policy options. Wecannot guarantee that individual local authorities will respond as predicted,or even rationally.    The lower the inflation assumption we build in, themore Treasurers will be tempted to play safe and budget for higher rateincreases.    The cash limit   sets a ceiling to central governmentscontribution;  and if inflation turns out lower than expected, the Governmentwill pay out only the lesser amount.    But Cabinet has now to decide on agrant percentage and on the inflation assumptions to build in to theeligible expenditure&apos; in determining the cash limit.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL10. Domestic element.   MISC 21 proposes that the Domestic RateRelief should remain at 18^p in the pound in England and 36p in Wales, asfor the last five years.11. Safety Net,    MISC 21 agrees that the &quot;safety net&apos; arrangements,which set a limit on the maximum year-on-year grant loss of individualauthorities, should be set at lp outside London, and at 3p for the LondonBoroughs.12. Scotland.   MISC 21 recommend thai the Secretary of State forScotland and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should agree bilaterallyupon the corresponding arrangements and figures for Scotland, once theCabinet has approved the figures for England and Wales.13. Transitional Arrangements.    MISC 21 recommend that if the newUnitary Grant system described in Annex B is approved by Ministers andintroduced in 1981-82 there should be transitional arrangements in 1980-81based on similar principles which would penalise the 20 or so highest-spending local authorities by tapering the grant payable under the increaseorders.14. I invite the Cabinet:-(i)      to agree to the recommendations of MISC 21 on the 1978-79second increase order (paragraph 2) on the first increaseorder for 1979-80 (paragraph 3) and on the cash limit to applyto the second increase order for 1979-80 (paragraph 4);(ii)      to agree that the distribution formula for 1980-81 shouldremain unchanged (paragraph 6);(iii) to agree the RSG percentage for 1980-81 (paragraph 5);(iv) to agree the cash limit for 1980-81 (paragraphs 7-8);(v)      to endorse the proposals for 1980-81 on the domestic element(paragraph 10) the safety net (paragraph 11) consequentialtreatment for Scotland (paragraph 12) and transitionalarrangements contingent on introduction of Unitary Grant(paragraph 13).W WHome Office23 October 19794CONFIDENTIAL

ANNEX B-DESIGN OF THE PROPOSED UNITARY GRANT SYSTEMThe main principles .   . &apos;1, Unitary grant will &quot;be paid direct to all counties and districtsin both metropolitan, and non-metropolitan areas and to the GT,C andILEA.   It wi.ll provide each authority with sufficient /rant tobridge the gap &quot;between &apos;iV&amp;   expenditure and the product, of a standardrate poundage prescribed by central Government on its rateable value.The appropriate standard poundage for each authority will dependupon the relationship between its actual expenditure and Governmenfsassessment of what it needs to spend; the Secretary of State willprescribe a schedule of poundages for different levels of expenditurein relation to assessed need.    The Government will in this way&quot;determine the respective contributions made by Government grant andby ratepayers for any given level of expenditure in. relation toassessed need.The Schedule of rate poundages2. The design of the schedule of poundages is a central part ofthe unitary grant mechanism because it enables Government todetermine^ the degree of pressure it wishes to apply/, authoritiesspending^exceiss of assessed need.    It will therefore be one of thekey issues to be determined each year under the unitary grantregime.3-    Although there are any number of possibilities the schedulescan be applied essentially in three different ways:a. so that grant declines proportionately as expenditureincreases above need; the penalty for excess expenditure isproportionately the same whatever the level of over-spending;b. so that grant declines prpgressively as soon as expenditurehas reached a specified thresho\i\    above assessed need; thepenalty for excess expenditure increases more than proportion-ately as over-spending increases;1
(c)    so that grant support declines as soon as expenditiroaches assessed need; for many anthoriti.es this couldmean that they would lose grant pound for pound asexpenditure increased above need.4.      Option (a)would provide no significant disincentive toexpenditure above assessed need whereas option (c) would undemJauthorities&apos; power to determine their own expenditure and wouldbe the same as applying cash limits to individual authorities kwould moke it very difficult to ensure that the&apos;penalties were&apos;applied only to those authorities which deserved them. &apos; It isenvisaged that schedules of the type described in option (b) aqwill in practice be used.    This will provide a taper forexpenditure in excess of assessed need,  thus increasing thepoundage cost to an authority of&quot; such expend! *ure.   The steepertaper of grant support would come into effect only afterexpenditure had reached a specified threshold above assessedneeds - say 5$ or 10$- in order to allow some: tolerance for theaccuracy of the needs assessment - no formula assessment of anindividual authorities&apos; needs can ever give a precise iridicaticof what it needs to spend.5. An illustrative example of a poundage schedule of the typdescribed in option (b) is shown below. This provides for a staper of grant support once expenditure reaches 110% of assessExpenditure as apercentage ofassessed.needStandard rate poundageon which grantcalculations are based\80859095100105110115120125*P56626874808693101110*For expenditure more than 25% above need thisauthority&apos;s grant would be reduced.j 2
5,    On the basis of the illustrative schedule shown above, unitarygrant would work as follows..    Two identical authorities each haveassessed expenditure needs of  300m and rateable value of  150m.Authority A spends exactly at the level of its assessed need(ie  300m) and so levies the standard rate poundage of 80p (assumingno changes in balances) which yields  I20m ( 150m x 80p). Itsgrant entitlement is  180m ( 300m -  120m) equivalent to 609? of itsexpenditure, leaving ratepayers to meet 40$.    Authority B, however,spends 20% above its assessed need  360m.    It levies a standardrate poundage llOp, yielding  165m (ie  150m xllOp).    Its grantentitlement is therefore  195m ( 360m -  165m), equivalent toonly 54/&quot; of its expend!ture, leaving ratepayers to meet 46$,Tiers&apos;],   Because of the differing functions of the tiers in differentclasses of authority (for example,  education is provided by countycouncils in shire areas but by district councils in metropolitanareas) each tier will need a separate needs assessment and ratepoundage schedule.    Thus there will be different poundage schedulesfor shire counties, shire districts, metropolitan counties,metropolitan districts and the London authorities reflecting theirvarious functions.   Account would also have to be taken of servicesprovided concurrently by different tiers.&quot;Levers&quot;8.  The present grant machinery incorporates a number of &quot;levers&quot; -as indicated in Annex A - which enable Ministers to exercise someinfluence over the overall balance and stability of the distribution.The new grant system must incorporate comparable mechanisms if thetransition to and operation of) unitary grant is to be as smooth asPossible, with the minimum of disruption for the majority of authoritie*ich comply with Government guidelines on expenditure.9* The mechanism proposed to achieve this is a system of &quot;multipliersGiven that an authority&apos;s entitlement to unitary grant will be thedifference between&quot;  its expenditure; and-  the sum produced from rates by the appropriate standardrate poundage,the Secretary of state will have the power to prescribe multipliers
(which may be greater or less than one) to the standard poundagethey apply to individual authorities.9* Thus if the prescribed multiplier for an individual authoritwere 0.95 it would in effect have to charge 95$ of its standardpoundage, rather than 100$. This would -effectively reduce the y-from the application of the standard rate poundage, increase thebetween the yield and the authority5 s expenditure and thus incre;its entitlement to grant by the desired amount. Conversely a rmigreater than 1  (say 1o05) would have the opposite effects10. It is an essential feature of the multiplier device that itshould be constrained by general principles applied to all authootherwise it could be used to make a totally arbitrary adjusimeirany individual authority&apos;s grant entitlement.11. Within this constraint the multiplier system would he used:- to replicate the mechanisms for the current London clavvbaarrangements and also the special v/ithin-London distributearrangements;.-   to place a limit on the degree of resource equalisation urunitary grant (which would be much greater than under thepresent arrangements) and thus to avoid any major shifts iidistribution of the grant; and- to place a limit - or safety net - on the grant losses ofindividual authorities.The Annual Cycle Under Unitary Grant12. The-annual cycle under a unitary grant system is likely &quot;to has follows:I1) S2I^M ^recedJ.ng the grant year: relevant expenditurneeds assessments and rate poundage schedules are publicat current prices. In addition the cash limit on the grwould be announced which would enable the needs assessmdand poundage schedules to be projected to outturn pricesline with cash limit assumptions;
ii) February/March preceding /the, grant year:   the rate poundageschedules are revised in OutturnCprices In the light ofinflation on authorities&apos; budgeted expenditure; they (andthe needs assessments) may also be adjusted to reflect anychange in the cash limits;lii) Aprili   grant payments commence at settlement (ie previousNoiembsi;) prices;I N Yjwbe! &apos;    (usually)a variation order (replacing the presentincrease order) in out^tura^ric^^ in accordance with thecash limit enabling the granlb.total to be adjusted eitherup or down;    the poundage schedules would be adjustedif necessary for grant calculation purposes;November after the end of the grant year: finaladjustment(corresponding to the present second increaseorder) to the fixed national sum of grant to he distributedaccording to actual outturn expenditure.tabilj tyefore rater, are set therefore,  the Government will publish atart or the year rate poundage schedules and expenditurenoedsKilts for every authority.   In this way ratepayers and councillorsable to see clearly the relationship between what their authoritypinna to spend and Government * s assessment of what it needs toand the effect of any gap between the two on the rates required,ties are set authorities will have to explain and justify toratepayers the higher rate poundage needed to finance highertitslrnPortant point here is the Government cash limit on grant,assessments and poundage schedules against which authorities&apos;re to be compared will be constrained to the national cash limitif ePfulaccountability is to be effective and the comparison a fairone it is essential that the cash limits are based on what&quot;ea-onably be defended as &quot;realistic&quot; inflation assumptions.aS localgovernment more accountable to ratepayers, central1 must face increased accountability over its cash limitlons,

The cash limit on RSG is likely to total some  665m in November,eforp allowance is made for the variable items.   The Group proposefiat it should be abated by  310m.   The cash limit on TSG, similarlywreased, is likely to stand at  70m (para 3).&apos;  Pay and price increases after November fall to be-&apos; dealt with insecond Increase Order next November.

The cash limit will continue to beI jus table (for the variable items).   The Group do not consider anyfther abatement should be made in the cash limit, and propose thatle exact figure (which will be between  130m and  150m) be settleditween officials. (Para 4).
