CONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTc(79) 4516 October 1979COPY NOCABINETWHITE PAPER ON THE IMMIGRATION RULESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department1.       I attach a draft White Paper containing my proposals for changingthe Immigration Rules.    The Ministerial Committee on Home and SocialAffairs agreed at its meeting on 26 September that the draft Rules inPart II were an acceptable basis for fulfilling our commitments and fordealing with current abuses.    I have made some changes to take accountof the points made by my colleagues since that meeting.CURTAILMENT OF RIGHT TO SETTLE2. We undertook to end the practice of allowing permanent settlementfor those who come here for a temporary stay.    The measures set out in thedraft White Paper will, combined with the reduction we are making in thenumber of work permits, effectively deal with abuse in this area.    I haveconsidered further the risk of criticism from our own supporters for notrestricting the settlement rights of work permit holders and theirdependants.    I am, however, convinced that, because of our internationalobligations, we cannot sensibly go further.DEPENDANTS3. The changes described at paragraphs 8 and 9 of Part I meet ourpromise to limit the entry of parents, grandparents and children over 18to a small number of urgent compassionate cases.HUSBANDS AND FIANCES4. We promised to end the concession to husbands and male fiances.The Rules in force before the concession was introduced contained asafeguard for hardship cases which meant that women were not required tolive with their husbands in countries where they might face difficultiescaused by differences in race, language, customs or religion.    This mighteasily allow the majority of Asian girls settled here to continue to bring inpartners from the Indian sub-continent whom they had never seen.    On theother hand, women marrying Americans, Australians or West Europeans inaccordance with normal Western customs would not be able to be joined bytheir husbands here.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5t       These difficulties are avoided by the approach set out inparagraph 10 of Part I and paragraphs 50-53 and 116-117 of Part II. Thiswould exclude the fiances or husbands of marriages whose main purposeappeared to be to achieve settlement here.    Other marriages or engagementsmight enable the man to qualify for entry provided that the woman was acitizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies born here.    This approachshould prove effective for the medium term;  the main uncertainty there-after is whether Asian girls born here, as they come to outnumber thoseentering from overseas, will look for marriage partners in the UnitedKingdom rather than from the Indian sub-continent.EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS6.       There is a very real risk that the proposals on husbands will befound to contravene the European Convention on Human Rights.    They willalso be criticised as contravening the spirit of our own sex discriminationlegislation.    I have considered whether our position could be made moredefensible if the Rules applied equally to wives and fiancees.    This would,however, cut across our commitment to the reunification of families andwould be largely ineffectual because of the favourable position of womenunder our nationality and immigration legislation.    The arguments are setout in more detail in the Annex.    I would not wish to rule out some furthercontrols on wives (particularly polygamously married ones) and fiancees inthe future but I am convinced that it would be a mistake to introduce thembefore our nationality and patriality legislation is put on a moresensible footing.TRANSITIONAL7.       The transitional arrangements proposed in paragraph 13 of Part Iare necessary if we are to avoid, as I think we should, aocTiSatiosva ofretrospection.    They mean that the full impact of the new changes will notbe felt for some time.CONCLUSION8.       I invite the agreement of my colleagues to publication of the WhitePaper as soon as possible.    The White Paper (which, of course, includesthe draft Rules) will probably require to be debated before the Rules areactually made, and I propose to discuss the timing and handling of thataspect with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Chief Whip.When the new Rules are laid, they will almost certainly be prayed againstand there will be pressure, which I do not think we should seek to resist,for a further debate on the Prayer.W WHome Office*6 October 1979CONFIDENTIAL
DRAFT WHITE PAPERTHE IMMIGRATION RULES -IntroductionThe Government will lay a statement of comprehensive newImmigration Rules before Parliament shortly.   The changes which areproposed are incorporated in the draft Rules set out in Part II ofthis White Paper.   The Government will provide an opportunity in thenear future for Parliament to debate these proposals /ETefore new Rulesare laid/.  The principal changes proposed are described in the followingparagraphs and are set out in italics in the draft Rules themselves.PARTJC^L.... THE GOVERNMENTS PROPOSALS2. The Government intends to continue the special voucher schemeintroduced in 1968 to provide for the admission of -certain United Kingdompassport holders who are subject to immigration control.Consolidation3. The Government propose that the Immigration Rules should beconsolidated to enable all the provisions affecting Commonwealth andforeign citizens, whether on or after entry, to be found in one document.Msisgian for temporary stay^       People who are admitted for temporary purposes such as visits orstudies would not be eligible to remain for another temporary purpose ifthis carried with it the prospect of eventual settlement.   It wouldtherefore no longer be possible for someone who had entered as a visitoror student to remain for work/t^o&quot; set up in business or as a self employedperson or as a person of independent means (paragraphs 90 and 91).5*       There would be time limits of one year and four years respectively onthe total periods for which a person may be admitted or granted extensions ofsto.y as a visitor or as a student for a succession of short coursesparagraphs 20, 9k and 99).*      People entering as visitors would be prohibited from taking employmentrefusal would be the normal course if they applied to be allowed totake work after their entry (paragraphs 20 and 91 ). New provisions :&quot;.Elating to the categories   of person who do not need work permits areCONFIDENTIAL
et out in paragraphs 31-3^t 108 and 119 o   Certain of these categories(set out in paragraphs 31-32) would need to be in possession of an entryclearance before being allowed to enter.   The dependants of students, ofwork permit holders, of persons admitted to set up in business, or self-einp] oyment, or as writers or artists or persons of independent means wouldin future be prohibited from taking employment (paragraphs 25 and ^tO),y.   People wishing to enter the country to set up in business or as self- -employed persons or as persons of independent means would first have to bein possession of an entry clearance (paragraphs 35 and 38).   People applyingfor entry clearance to set up in business or self-employment would need toproduce evidence that they had a specified minimum amount of capital availablefor investment and that their acitivites would be likely to generate employmentin this country for people already settled here (paragraphs 35-37)o Personsof independent means would need to meet similar financial requirements butwould in addition be required to show other reasons why they should be admittedto the United Kingdom (paragraph 38).Dependants8. No changes are proposed to the current rights of men settled here to bringover their wives and children under 18.   Children aged 18 or over would qualifyfor settlement only where the circumstances were of the most strongly cornpas-sionate nature, although special consideration would be given to daughtersunder 21 who formed part of the family unit overseas and had no otherrelative to whom they could turn (paragraph 47).9. Parents and grandparents aged 65 or over would, in addition to theexisting requirements, have to prove that they were without other relativesin their own country to whom they could turn and that they had a standardofliving substantially below that of their own country,   Parents andgrandparents under 65, except widows, would not qualify for entry save inthe most exceptional compassionate circumstances and certain other closerelatives would be in a similar position (paragraph 48). ^ baads.....and fiancesThe restrictions on the entry and stay of husbands and fiances in^agraphs 50-53 and 116-117 of the draft Rules are designed to curtail theexPloitation of marriage as a means of primary immigration.   In futureUsbands and fiances will not be permitted to enter or remain if^ere is reason to believe that settlement in this country is the main
CONFIDENTIALmotive of the marriage.   Moreover, the wife must be a citizen of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies born in this country.GeneralU.      The draft Rules in Part II contain several other changes designedto remove obscurities and anomalies and to reduce the scope for evasion.In particular, the draft Rules indicate (paragraph 88) that applicationsfrom overstayers are normally to be refused;    that out of time applicationsneed not be considered even if they meet the formal requirements of theRules;   and that any supporting evidence required must be produced withoutunreasonable delay.   In several places references to public funds havebeen introduced to make it clear that people admitted in whatever capacitymaintain and accommodateare expected to .   /        themselves and any dependants from their ownresources without recourse to public funds.12.      The most important of the other miscellaneous changes proposedare indicated below:(a) it would be made clear that a person is &quot;settled&quot; in theUnited Kingdom, notwithstanding an earlier breach of theimmigration laws, where his position has been regularisedaccordingly (paragraph 1 );(b) the position of entry clearance officers underthe Rules would be clarified (paragraph 12);(c) the holder of an entry clearance v/ould be liableto be refused entry if he had, by not disclosing materialfacts, obtained an entry clearance for which he did notqualify (paragraph 13(a) );(d) new provisions relating to au pair girls would berestricted to nationals of West European countries. Anage limit and stronger controls on &quot;au pairs&quot; takingemployment v/ould also be imposed (paragraphs 26 and 106).(e) the rules on working holidayraakers would be amendedto provide for an age limit of 25 and a time limit of 2 yearsfor the holiday (paragraphs 30 and 96);
(f) the rules on political asylum and refugees wouldbe amended to bring them more closely into line with theprovisions of the Convention relating to the Status ofRefugees and current practice (paragraphs 16,  4, 87, 120 and 138);(g) an immigration officer would, when considering whetheror not to grant leave to enter, be able to take into accountthe previous immigration history of the passenger (paragraph67);(h) new provisions would be introduced governing thestay of students in receipt of awards from Governments orofficial agencies (paragraphs 91 and 100).   Such studentswould normally be required to leave at the end of the studiesfor which they were in receipt of their award;(transitional13c      The new Rules would apply to all applications on which a decisionis taken on or after the date on which - the new Rules are laid but theGovernment will be prepared to consider on the basis of the present Rulesall applications made before the date of publication of this White Paper.The Government will also be prepared to consider on the basis of thepresent Rules applications for further stay from people who before thenew Rules take effect have been admitted temporarily or given leave toremain on or for marriage, for work, to set up in business or self-employment, or as persons of independent means.

7before that date.   If his passport or travel document is endorsed witha restriction on the period for which he may remain outside his countryof normal residence, his stay in the United Kingdom should be limited soas not to extend beyond the period of authorised absences   The holderof a travel document issued by the Home Office should not be givenleave to enter for a period extending beyond the validity of thatdocument.   This paragraph does not apply to persons who are eligiblefor admission for settlement.Refv ere e s16.___Where   a   person   is     a refugee full account is to betaken of the provisions of the Convention Relating to the Status ofP-efugees (Cmd. 9171). Nothing in these Rules is to be construed asrequiring action contrary to the United Kingdom&apos;s obligations underthis Convention.Part II of these rules deals with admission for temporary purposes,Part III with admission for employment and Part IV with admission forsettlement.   Part V contains special provisions concerning nationalsof countries which are members of the European Economic Community. Inall cases admission is subject to the possession of a valid current entryclearance where that is required by these rules and to the passengerbeing acceptable under Part VIII.-  BLII PASSENGERS COMING FOR TEMPORARY PURPOSESVisitors*7*     A passenger seeking entry as a visitor, including one coming t^o^stay^I^fej^glatiyes or friends, is to be admitted if he satisfies the ImmigrationOfficer that he is genuinely seeking entry for the period of the visit
8as stated by him and that for that period he will maintain and accommodate -himself and any dependants, or will, with any dependants, be maintainedand accommodated adequately by relatives or friends, without working orrecourse to public funds, and can meet the cost of the return or onwardjourney.   But in all cases leave to enter is to be refused if theImmigration Officer is not so satisfied, and in particular, leave toenter is to be refused where there is reason to believe that the passenger&apos;sreal purpose is to take employment or that he may become a charge onpublic funds if admitted.18. Visitors may be admitted for private medical treatment at their ownexpense provided that in the case of a passenger suffering from aconmiunicabl^^disease the Medical Inspector is satisfied that there isno 0&apos;anger to public health.   The Immigration Officer must be satisfied asto the passenger&apos;s intentions in accordance with paragraph 17 and thatthe caintenance and accommodation requirements of that paragraph are met.He should also take into account the Medical Inspectors assessment ofthe likely cost of treatment in deciding whether the passenger&apos;s meanswould be adequate.   The passenger may be required to produce evidencethat arrangements have been made for consultation or treatment.19. Passengers admitted to the United Kingdom as visitors are free totransact business during their visit.   Those wishing to establish^S  iX?.s 3-n business or self-employment in the United Kingdom must,^^S^J^Fply with paragraphs 35-37.The Immigration Officer should impose a time limit on the period ofthe visitor&apos;s stay and on that of any dependants accompanying him. APeriod of 6 months will normally be appropriate;    but a longer periodQtj-xceeding one year) may be allowed to a passenger who satisfies the
tjje immigration Officer of his ability to maintain and accommodate himselfand his dependants for that time as required by paragraph 17-   The periodshould not be restricted to less than 6 months unless this is justified byspecial reasons - for example, in cases of restricted returnability (seeparagraph 15), or if the passenger is due to leave the United Kingdom ona particular charter service, or in transit to another country, of if hiscase ought to be subject to early review by the Home Office. Visitorsshould normally be prohibited from talcing employment.Students21,     A passenger seeking entry to study in the United Kingdom should beadmitted (subject to paragraph 13) if he presents a current entry clearancegranted for that purpose.   An entry clearance will be granted if theapplicant produces evidence which satisfies the entry clearance officerthat he has been accepted for a course of study at a. university, a collegeof education or further education, an independent school or any bona. fideprivate educational institution;    that the course will occupy the whole ora substantial part of his time;    and that he can, without working and withoutrecourse to public funds, meet the cost of the course and of his own maintenance SLj gPJffiodation and that of any dependants during the course.22o     An applicant is to be refused an entry clearance as a student if theentry clearance officer is not satisfied that the applicant is able, andintends,,to follow a full-time course of study and to leave the country oncompletion of it.   In assessing the case the officer should consider such &apos;points as whether the applicant&apos;s qualifications are adequate for the coursee ProPOses to follow, and whether there is any evidence of sponsorship byhis home government or any other official body.   As a general rule aner,try clearance is not to be granted unless the applicant proposes to
10e.pettd sot less than 15 hours a week in organised daytime study of asingle subject or of related subjects, and is not to be granted for thetaking of a correspondence course.23.  An applicant accepted for trailing as a nurse or midwife at ahospital should be granted an entry clearance as a student unless thereis evidence that he or she had obtained acceptance by misrepresentationor does not intend to follow the. coarse.   Doctors and dentists are: deeible for full-time post-graduate study even though they also intendduring their stay to seek employment in training posts related to theirstudies.2;i-c  A-passenger who holds a current entry clearance, or who can satisfythe Immigration Officer that he fulfils the requirements of paragraphs2v--2.3, may be admitted for an appropriate period depending en the lengthof the course of study and on Ms means, with a condition restricting hisfreedom to take employment f   he should be advised to apply to the EaseOffice before the expiry of his leave to enter for any extension of staythat may be required.   A passenger who satisfies the Immigration Officerthat he has genuine end realistic intentions ef studying in the UnitedKingdom but cannot satisfy the requirements ef paragraphs SL--23 may beedaitted for a short period, within the limit of his means, with aprohibition on the taking of employment, and should be advised to applyto the Home Office for further consideration of his ease.

PAST VIII.   REFUSAL OF LEAVE TO ENTER     . -GeneralA passenger who does not qualify for admission under the foregoingprovisions of these rules is to be refused leave to enter.   In addition,the Immigration Officer has power (subject to the restrictions containedin the next paragraph) to refuse leave to enter on any of the groundsset out in paragraphs 70-76 below.   Except as provided for in paragraphgli  the fact that a passenger satisfies the formal, requirements of theforegoing provisions of these rules is not conclusive in his favour.Leave to enter may be refused if, for example, the jpassenger has notobserved the time limit or conditions imposed on any grant of leave toenter or remain;    if, whether or not to his knowledge, false representationshave been employed or material facts not disclosed, orally or in writing,for the purpose of obtaining an entry clearance;    of-if a previous leaveto enter or remain has been obtained by deception. &apos; -But a passenger whoholds a current entry clearance is not to be refused leave to enter exceptin the circumstances described in paragraph 15.co*       A passenger who -is a Commonwealth citizen who was settled in the United Kingdomat the coming into force of the Act, and qualifies forreadmission under paragraph 56, or(b)   qualifies for admission under paragraph kk or ^6 as the wifeor the child under 16 of a Commonwealth citizenwho was settled in the United Kingdom at the coming intoforce of the Act and holds an entry clearance issued for thatpurpose,is to be refused, leave to enter only on the ground that he or she iscurrently subject to a deportation order.u7eThe power to refuse leave to enter is not to be exercised by an
27Immigration Officer acting on his own.

If he produces a medical certificate, he should he advisedto hand it to the Medical Inspector.   Any- passenger who mentions healthor medical treatment as a reason for his visit, or who appeals not tobe in good health or appears to be mentally or physically abnormal,should also be referred to the Medical Inspector;   and the ImmigrationOfficer has discretion, which should be exercised sparingly, to referfor examination in any other case.71. Where the Medical Inspector advisee that for medical reasons it isundesirable to admit the passenger the Immigration Officer should refuseleave to enter unless he considers admission warranted by strongcompassionate reasons.   He may also refuse leave to enter where thepassenger declines to submit to a medical examination.    And where theMedical Inspector advises that a passenger is suffering from a specified,disease or condition which may interfere with his ability to supporthimself or his dependants, the Immigration Officer should take accountoi this, in conjunction with other factors, in deciding whether toadmit the passenger.72. Returning residents or the spouses and children under 18 of peoplesettled in the United Kingdom should not be refused lea.ve to enter onEedical grounds.   But where a person would be refused leave to enter onneoical grounds&apos; if he were not a returning resident or the spouse or
28child of a resident, or in any case where it is decided on compassionategrounds not to exercise the power to refuse leave to enter, or in anyother case in which the Medical Inspector so recommends, the ImmigrationOfficer should give the person a notice requiring him to report to theKedical Officer of Environmental Health designated by the MedicalInspector with a view to further examination and any necessary treatment.73.   The entry clearance officer has the same discretion to referapplicants for entry&apos; clearance.for medical examination as an immigrationofficer to refer passengers to a Medical Inspector and the same principleswill apply when he decides whether or not to issue an entry clearance.Criminal record -7&apos;f.   A passenger, other than the wife or child under 18 of a person settledin the United Kingdom, who has been convicted in any country, includingthe United Kingdom, of an offence included in the list of extraditioncrimes contained in the First Schedule to the Extradition Act 1870, asa;tended, Qjrj^pXfenjse for whichjajogrson is returnable under the FugitiveOffenders Act 1967, is to be refused leave to enter unless the immigrationofficer considers admission to be justified for strong compassionatereasons.Subject to deportation order(5-   Any passenger who is currently subject to a deportation order is toto refused&apos;leave to enter.    If he wishes to make representations, heshould be advised that after his departure it will be open to him toaPply for revocation of the order and, where appropriate, that he willhave a right of appeal if revocation is refused. xclusiori conducive to the public good&apos;0-   Any passenger except the v/ife and child under 18 of a person settled
29in the United Kingdom may he refused leave to enter on the ground thathis exclusion is conducive to the public good, where -(a.) the Secretary of State has personally so directed, or(b)   from information available to the immigration officerit seems right to refuse leave to enter on that ground -if, for example, in the light of the passenger&apos;s character,conduct or associations it is undesirable to give himleave to enter.Country of destination, on removal7&apos;7.   The power to refuse leave to enter should normally be exercised soas to secure the passenger&apos;s removal to the country in which he boardedthe ship or aircraft that brought him to the United Kingdom.   Removal toa different country may, however, be justified by the circumstances of aparticular case.Communication with friends, etc.78.   Before removal a passenger should be given the opportunity totelephone friends or relatives in this country, or his High Commissionor Consul, if he wishes to do so.Right to apply for bail19-   Where a passenger is detained pending a decision whether to admithim he is to be notified, when 7 days have elapsed since his arrival inthe United Kingdom, of his right to apply to an adjudicator for bail.To assist him in deciding whether to exercise this right he should begiven facilities to communicate with friends, relatives, a legal adviser,the United Kingdom Immigrants Advisory Service or his High Commission orConsul as he may wish.
30FART IX.   RIGHTS OP APPEAL80,   Where refusal of leave to enter is confirmed, the passenger shouldbe handed a notice informing him of the decision and of the reasons forrefusal.   This notice will also state his right of appeal, except incases of refusal under paragraph 7.6(a-) in which by virtue of section 13(5)of the Act no appeal lies.    If he has difficulty in understanding thenotices its meaning should be explained to him.Si,   A person who claims to be patrial may a.ppeal immediately against adecision that he or she requires leave to enter the United Kingdom if theclaim is based on section 2(l)(a) or (b) of the Act, or if she is acitizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies claiming patriality bymarriage to a person to whom section 2(l)(a,) or (b) applies, or if heor she holds a certificate of patriality.    A person who holds a currententry clearance or who is a person named in a current work permit and whois entitled to appeal against refusal of leave to enter may also appealbefore he is removed from the United Kingdom.   To assist him in decidingwhether to appeal he should be given- facilities to communicate withfriends, relatives, a legal adviser, the United Kingdom ImmigrantsAdvisory Service or his Consul or High Commission as he may wish. Insuch a case, if notice of appeal is lodged, the Immigration Officershould provide the adjudicator and the appellant, as soon as possible,with a written summary of the facts of the case and the reasons for thedecision.

Under section 3(3) of the Act a limited leave to enter or remain in thenitec Kingdom may be varied by extending or restricting its duration, by adding,uying or revoking conditions or by removing the time limit (whereupon anyjor.ditions attached to the leave cease to apply).

In deciding thesematters account is to be taken of all the relevant facts;    the fact that theapplicant satisfies the formal requirements of these Rules for stay, or furtherstay, in the proposed capacity is not conclusive in his favour.   For example, gfusal^ will, be the normal course if the applicant has employed deceptionin obtaining leave to enter (including the giving of undertakings, express LJSPl,i-SAi which he has not honoured, as to the duration and purpose of his tayjj   if he has not observed the time limit and conditions subject to whichlie was admitted, or given leave to remain;    if in the light of his character,conduct or associations it is undesirable to permit him to remain;    if herepresents a danger to national security;    or if he might not be returnable -to another country if allowed to remain for the period for which he wishesto stay.

In particular, except as specified in paragraphs 117 and 119,plications to remain are to be refused where the application is to remain&apos;or a purpose for which an entry clearance is required.   Applications to-pciain for other purposes (not including employment, which is dealt with inthe next paragraph) may be granted, provided that the relevant requirementsif these Rules are met, unless it appears that the applicant is attemptingtowain, psrmanently...)1, In regard to variation of leave to enter with a view to employment, thejeneral position is that where a person wishes to come to work in the United(ingdora the employer must have obtained a work permit before the person sets out;aid people admitted as visitors or students or for other temporary purposes haveinder these Rules no claim to stay here in employment.   Applications for thisimpose by people who are subject to a condition prohibiting employment or whosestudies were financed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, an international scholarshipgMcyj or by their home government, should be refused without reference to thejepartcenc of Employment.    In cases where there is no such condition, therestill no claim to remain here in employment but it may be appropriate toffirthe case to the Department of Employment.   Only if that Department isprepared in the particular case to approve the proposed employment may anappropriate extension of stay be granted;    where the circumstances of the:ase are such as to make reference to the Department inappropriate (for exampletee any of the factors mentioned in paragraph 88 apply), or where the Depart-K&apos;it does not approve the proposed employment, an extension should be refused.re&apos;&apos;.&apos; members&apos; A person who has been given leave to enter to join a ship or an aircraft[Kir.bers of its crew, or a crew member who has been given leave to enter forsPital treatment, repatriation or transfer to another ship or aircraft in thelutea Kingdom should be granted an extension stay only when this is necessaryfulfil the purpose for which he was given leave to enter, unless he qualifies^ extension of stay in accordance with paragraph 115 or 117.orisitorseople admitted as visitors will have satisfied the Immigration Officer thai--mention was&apos;to come for a limited period.

An extension of stay should normally berefused if it would lead to more than four years being spent on short courses.For the purpose of this paragraph a short course is one of less than two yearsbut includes a longer course where this is broken off before being completed.100.

Nor will deportation normallys armrooriate if the child left the family home on talcing employment and hasstulilielied himself on an independent basis, or if. he married before deportation;eb into prospect.    In the case of children of school age it will be right tolake into account,  on the one hand, the disruptive effect of removal, on theirLcation and, on the other, whether plans for their care and maintenance in this&apos;taitry if one or both parents were deported are realistic and likely to beJfiectrre.M  In tome cases it may be relevant to take into account the possibility of theventual return of members of the family to the United Kingdom after deportation,tea a child reaches 18 he will cease to be subject to the deportation order andtwill be open to him to qualify for re-admission under the Immigration Rules.jhe wife would cease to be subject to the order if the marriage came to an end,jtd could similarly qualify for re-adinission;    but her return would otherwiseindependent on revocation of the order made against her or her husband.Isylura50* In accordance v/ith the provisions of the Convention Relating to the^us of Refugees (Cmd.9171), a deportation order v/ill not be made againstP^son if the only country to which he can be removed is one to which he iswilling to go owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons oftte, religion, nationality, membership of a particular- group or political opinion.
3oProcedurehen a decision to make a deportation order has been taken (otherwise thanmmendation of a court) a noticewillrbe given to the person concerned,reco:151- 4*1-or, uin rccordan.ee with the Immigration Appeals (Notices.) Regulations 1972, informinghin of the decision and of his right of appeal or facility to make representationsin the case cf the security and political cases subject to the advisory procedure.Jhere is power for the Secretary of State to make a detention order, or an orderrestricting a person as to residence and requiring him to report to the police,pending any appeal,   hhere a person is detcined pending an appeal, he may apply toan adi\&apos;ciicator for release on bail.    If a notice of appeal is given, a summary ofthe facts of the case on the basis of which the decision was taken, or of thegrounds for alleging that the appeal was invalid, will be sent to the appellateauthorities who will notify the appellant of the arrangements for the appealto be heard.Submission of deportation order for signature152   Tf no appeal is lodged within the prescribed time limit, or if the appeal isdisoissed, the order for deportation will be submitted to the Secretary of Statefor his signature.    The submission will include a summary of the facts of the case,written confirmation (where appropriate) that the appellate authorities havediscussed the appeal and a note of any other relevant information, whether or notit was available to the courts or the appellate authorities.    In a case ofdeportation on security or political grounds&apos; the opinions of the advisers(see paragraph 135)will he submitted to the Secretary of State for hisconsideration.Returned deportees^53. &quot;here a person returns to this country notwithstanding that a deportationMer is in force against him, he may lawfully be deported under the originaloruer and it will normally be right to deport him.    But every such case is to&quot; cor-sic.ered in the light of all the relevant circumstances before the intention0 enforce the order is notified to the person.   He has a right cf appeal againstlvj &apos;al but solely on the ground that on the facts of the case there is in lawtot-er ^ remove- him from the United Kingdom.
51rrangenients for removal-,r,k   provision is made in the Act for the removal from the United Kingdom of aoerson against whom a deportation order has been made.    The power should beexercised so as to secure the person&apos;s return to the country of which he is anational, or which has most recently provided, him with a travel document, unlessre can show that another country will receive him notwithstanding his deportationfroia the United Kingdom;    but, in considering any departure from the normalarrangements, regard should be had to the public interest generally, and to anyadditional expense that may fall on public funds.    The person is to be notifiedcf fcis right to appeal against the removal directions on the ground that he.oughtto be removed (if at all) not to the country named in the directions but to adifferent country or territory specified by him.Revocation of deportation orders155 . Revocation of a deportation order does not entitle the person concerned tore-enter the United Kingdom;    it renders him eligible to ciualify for admissionWider the Immigration Rules.   Application for revocation of the order may be madeto tie entry clearance officer or direct to the Home Office,   Where the applicationfor revocation is refused there is a right of appeal, in the first instance to anadjudicator unless the order was made against a person as belonging to the familyof another person, in which case it lies to the Tribunal.   But no appeal liesthere the Secretary of State personally decides that continued exclusion from theUnited Kingdom is conducive to the public good, nor so long as the person is inthe United Kingdom.   Where an appeal does lie the right of appeal will be notifieda* the sane time as the decision to refuse to revoke the order.^6.  Applications for the revocation of a deportation order will be carefully ,considered in the light of the grounds on which the order was made and of the casetecse in support of the application.    The interests of the community, including the^ntenance of an effective immigration control, are to be balanced against the^erects of the applicant, including any circumstances of a compassionate nature.In n ?v,&apos;e Case of an applicant with a serious criminal record continued exclusion,fora long term of years, will normally be the proper course.    In other cases-cuion of the order will not normally be authorised, unless the situation has
52been materially altered either by a change of circumstances since the order wasKis or by fresh information coming to light which was not before the court thatcr.de the recommendation or the appellate authorities or the Secretary of State.Sie passage of time since the person was deported may also, in itself, amount tosuch a change of circumstances as to warrant revocation of the order.   Since soEuch depends on other relevant circumstances, it is not practicable to specifyperiods as appropriate in relation to particular grounds cf deportation. Allapplications for revocation will be carefully considered when made but    save inthencst exceptional circumstances    the Secretary of State will not revohe a:-- order which has been in force for less than 3 years ; -:

CONFIDENTIALANNEXAPPLICATION OP MARRIAGE RESTRICTIONS TO WOMEN1. There are certain provisions in the immigration and nationality laws whichwould make an attempt to restrict the entry of wives ineffective in a very largeproportion of cases.   Women Commonwealth citizens marrying citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies with the right of abode become patrial (i.e. have the rightof abode in the United Kingdom) at once and foreign women in the same positionhave aright to register as citizens, whereupon they, too become patrial. Addedto this is the protection accorded by section l(5) of the Immigration Act 1971 tothe wives of any Commonwealth citizen settled here before 1 January 1973&apos; theymust be able to enter on the same basis as before.2. There is also the point that we have endorsed the policy of successiveGovernments in committing ourselves to the reuniting of families by allowing wiveand children in to join heads of household settled here.    To attempt to apply new-restrictions to wives now would, apart from being largely ineffective, lead toaccusations of broken faith and the near certainty of an adverse decision underthe European Convention on Human Rights.3. These objections do not apply with such force to fiancees except to theextent that a. great number of fiancees could put themselves in the same positionas wives by persuading their prospective husbands.to travel abroad and marry them^ose that did not do this, or whose prospective husbands were not our citizens,could be greatly inconvenienced by simply being required to obtain an entryclearance.   There are certainly some arguments in favour of requiring fiancees tohave entry clearance, but there is the substantial objection that this would addto the work of our posts overseas.   And the motives behind, the move could beattributed by our critics to a desire to delay, by bureaucratic sleight of hand,e eatry of those entitled to come here. Although there are cases of fianceeswho take advantage of the present system (by, for example, divorcing their U.K.tased husband and then bringing in someone else) no figures a.re kept and we haveittle evidence at present that the move is necessary to curb a widespread abuse.A, nrh-nere is one major objection in rogic to equality in restricting entry ofth&apos;e Sey-es.   If people a,re to marry they ought to be able to live somewhere and,j f- Vfe are to have any restriction at all, the natural rule is that a. marriedouPle should live in the husband1 s country of origin.   Rules which, also forbadeUsband settled here to bring in his wife might have the effect, if the wife&apos;scsi! IAL
CONFIDENTIALcountry similarly forbade the entry of foreign husbands, of depriving the coupleof any chance of living anywhere.is necessarily satisfactoryQuite large numbers enter annually and there seemsa case for considering very carefully whether some further restrictions shouldbe applied.   There is also a problem about polygamous marriages.   But the sensiblecourse is to wait until the nationality law has been changed before making changesin this field.All this is not to say that the situation as regards the entry of fiancees
