CONFIDENTIALLent is the property of her britannic majesty-s governmentC(79) 4823 October 1979copy noCABINETNATIONALISED INDUSTRIES1 CASH LIMITSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy (E) invited me on20 September to bring forward proposals in October for cash limits fornationalised industries on the lines set out in Annex A.2. It is now urgent to set the limit for coal before the wage negotiationson 31 October and it is not desirable to set the coal limit in isolation. Ihope that we can settle most of the other limits but I recognise that in viewof decisions taken recently by E Committee it will not be possible to do sothis week for the Electricity Boards or for the Gas Corporation. Thispaper accordingly excludes electricity and gas from the present discussion.We can defer publication till later in November which will leave time forany further consultation that is needed with the nationalised industrymanag em ent s.3. There is no simple or mechanistic way of arriving at satisfactorycash limits for nationalised industries which will exert an adequatediscipline and at the same time satisfy the criterion of realism (which ECommittee has since endorsed for the Rate Support Grant (RSG) cash limit -see C(79) 47).4. Apart from these general requirements, the following points, whichmay to some extent conflict, are relevant to setting the limits:  our Julypublic expenditure decisions, as modified since, e. g. by the E Committeedecisions on gas and electricity; the industries&apos; revised financingforecasts; our own economic forecasts and in particular the Industry Actforecast published during November; the starting point agreed inSeptember that cash limits should look for a reduction in real labour costsper unit of output;  compatibility with the RSG cash limit which is to bepublished on 16 November and with its public presentation.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SPECIAL NATURE OF NATIONALISED INDUSTRY LIMITS ANDTHE CHAIR MEN&apos;3 VIEWS5. The Chairmen have stressed in the paper sent to me by-Sir William Barlow on 18 October (reproduced at Annex C) the specialnature of cash limits for the nationalised industries.    These apply to theirexternal financing ie. the difference between their capital requirementsand their internal resources.    The amount of finance they need is thus thedifference between much larger flows of revenue and expenditure. Theyhave pointed out that the difference between Departments and tradingorganisations has been acknowledged since cash limits were introduced.6. Our predecessors&apos; 1976 White Paper pointed out that becausefinancing needs are dependent on trading conditions the external financingfigures would be:&quot;treated as a form of cash limit&quot; which &quot;cannot be immutable ....like private sector companies, their revenues and expendituresdepend on trading conditions.    There may well be causes quitebeyond the control of a particular industry, reflecting not at allon its efficiency, which would make it exceed its borrowing estimate.An example would be a change in the forecast cash flow of an energyindustry caused by an exceptional winter&quot;.&quot;Nevertheless, there will be no presumption that a financing deficitwill be met by a further injection of external finance. &quot;I think this expresses a sensible approach to the special form of cash limit.It would show that we recognised this if we adopted the Chairmen&apos;s suggestionand used the term &quot;external financing limit&quot; in future instead of &quot;cash limit&quot;.7. I am sure we cannot accept the Chairmen&apos;s proposal that we shouldpublish only a global limit for the industries taken together.    This wouldexercise no discipline whatever.    Nor can we accept in advance and as ageneral principle that if prices or pay rise faster than assumed at the timethe limit is set we will agree to increase it.    We cannot, however, denythat if this happens, the Corporations can reasonably expect the Government:&quot;either to reconsider their .... limits, or alternatively to acceptthe need for whatever action is necessary to enable them to staywithin those limits&quot;.Where it is not practicable to cut costs sufficiently, this is bound to havelmplications for prices.    Sponsor Ministers will wish to consider theChairmen&apos;s suggestion that there should be an exchange of letters about theassumptions underlying the limits.    If such letters are exchanged, I shouldQf course like my officials to be consulted before this is done.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PROPOSED LIMITS8. The cash limits proposed in Annex A are more likely than thoseset in the past to be difficult for the industries;  but it is essential that wekeep in mind in this as in other cases the narrow limits on the amount ofmoney we can make available.    The economic prospect has worsened bothfor inflation and for growth and the industries have not yet fully adjustedto this; perhaps partly because the limits are being set earlier thannormal.    Secondly many of the potential remedies for threatened breacheshave already been adopted as contributions to the public expenditurereductions e.g. on prices and de-manning and on postponement ofinvestment by the Post Office and the electricity industry.    This leaveslittle room for manoeuvre to meet contingencies.    The figures in Annex Aare generally bb.seu on the industries&apos; own assumptions about movementsin relevant prices and costs, including wage costs.    These are broadlyconsistent with the comparable assumptions made in the RSG context. Ihave regarded the July figures decided by Cabinet, increased to allow forprice increases between this year and next as setting an upper limit to theexternal financing to be made available.9. Annex B, which has been prepared by Treasury officials, commentson some of the individual industries.    It brings out any inconsistencieswith paragraph 2, disagreement between Departments, and the risksinvolved, particularly where officials judge that the industries do not inpractice have plausible remedies for a threatened breach open to them.British Steel and British Rail are cases in point.INFLATION ASSUMPTIONS AND PAY10. Most of the industries have assumed that the new settlements areno higher than or the same as their own assumptions about inflation, whichare in several cases lower by 2 or 3 percentage points than now seemslikely.    This will not ensure in every case that unit labour costs will belower in real terms during 1980-81 as a whole than in 1979-80.    The mainreason is that the 1980-81 wage bill is pushed up (more than the 1979-80wage bill) by the second stage of 1979 settlements paid late in the year.Some increase in real unit labour costs seems likely on rail and postalservices, where output is expected to be falling, reflecting in the case ofrail the prospective decline in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Insome of the smaller industries eg. docks and road transport, pay levelsare influenced by settlements elsewhere in the industry.    However in thecases of telecommunications, steel, coal, airports and airways, the figuresimply reductions in real unit labour costs.tt*       For the reasons given in paragraph 8, the proposed limits are likelyto be tight.    Each 1 per cent by which the industries have underestimatednon-labour costs would add about  200 million to their aggregate expenditureand a 1 per cent change in labour costs adds  120 million.    The industries3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmay also have underestimated the effect oi the recession on sales revenueeg. British Rail.    On balance I do not propose further reductions belowthe figures discussed with the industries in the light of Mini&amp;ters&apos; Julydecisions, in an attempt (which might well fail) to enforce reductions inreal unit labour costs between financial years in every case.PROCEDURE12. I understand that the industries have not yet finally accepted theproposed limits although they are aware of the sort of figures we have inmind.    I suggest, that if the limits in Annex A are agreed, the next stepshould be for sponsor Ministers to discuss them with their Chairmen.It is possible that the Chairmen will press for an early collective meetingto discuss the memorandum sent by Sir William Barlow.    I hope it willbe possible to avoid such a meeting before the cash limits are publishedon the grounds that the paper is too important and has arrived too late tobe adequately discussed in the short time available.    But we could saymeanwhile that we welcome the paper and look forward to a discussionlater, which will affect the next round,PUBLICATION AND PRESENTATION13. Although the discussions I have suggested should take place quickly,it would probably be best to postpone publication until 20 November, thesame day as the RSG limit for England and Wales is published. Thisshould allow time to settle the limits for the electricity and gas industries.We will presumably want to stress both the difference between the twokinds of cash limit and the difference between the circumstances andassumptions relevant to individual industries.    But on the figures I amproposing we should be able to say that the range of assumptions aboutinflation used was in broad terms consistent with the figure of 13 per centhighlighted in the presentation of the RSG limit.    Both the RSG and thenationalised industry figures will need to be defensible in relation to theIndustry Act forecast whether it comes out before or after 20 November.CONCLUSIONS14. I ask my colleagues:a. to endorse the approach to nationalised industry cash limitsand to the Chairmen&apos;s proposals set out in paragraphs 5-7.b. To agree to set cash limits at the levels in Annex A and tothe proposals in paragraphs 12 and 13.G HTreasury Chambers23 October 19794CONFIDENTIAL

ANNEX BNATIONAL COAL BOARD (NCB)I Committee on 17 October (E(79)12th Mtg, Item 1) agreed thatthe total external financing figure for the NCB in 1980/81 at1979 Survey prices should he  613 million; the split of thistotal figure between grants and net borrowing, has yet to beagreed.2.    The NCB is assuming      prices will rise by 15% in 1979/80over the previous year and by a further 15% in 1980/81. Moreover,it is assumed that wage increases in 1980/81 will be in line withthe general rate of inflation and that the increased wage costsKill feed through directly to prices in line with general inflation.E Committee agreed that excessive wage settlements would have tobe financed by increases in the price of coal.    (Note : NCBcosts are increased by some  20 million for every 1% shortfallin productivity.    1% on their pay bill adds  18 million totheir costs.)    Since it is also assumed that there will be a risein productivity of 2%, the NCB assume for purposes of the cashUnits that that part of unit costs attributable to pay&apos; falls inreal terms.    In view of past performance there must be considerabletoubt about this assumption.3.    On the basis of the NCB assumptions and the E Committeeaecicion the external financing limit for the industry in 1980/81would be  834- million.    However, the NCB have made certain extraallowances for cost increases which take the total beyond thelimit indicated in paragraph 8 of the Chancellor&apos;s paper. TheProposed limit has therefore been restricted to  810 million.^    If enhanced redundancy payments are agreed then the costls to be met from within the  513 million referred to above.^    Without the constraint of the NCB/CEGB agreement on coal-takethe NCB believe that prices could rise by about 17%5 which mighta^ov; a wage settlement of a similar order.   .But if the settlement vWaG much above this there could be marked difficulties about-raisirig prices to the extent necessary; this would particularly affectthe NCB&apos;s market share compared with imports in later years.
ISH NATIONAL OIL CORPORATIONJuly public &quot;expenditure decision implied a 1980/81 externalncing requirement for BNOC of  100 million at Survey prices,have since then revised their oil price and exchange rateoptions for 1980/81 from  22.50/barrel and  1 =  2.00 to11/barrel and  1 =  2.10.    This has increased their estimatedrnal resources, allowing a reduction in BNOC&apos; s externalncing requirements to  80 million at Survey prices.tBNOCs oil price and exchange rate assumptions are close toent Government forecasts, especially when combined in anled sterling oil price.    BNOCs assumption about inflation,13.25% for 1980/81 on 1979/80, and their deflator of 1.266relatively low.    However BNOCs own calculations, on whichagreed Survey figures are based, are made at outturn prices;their revenues and a substantial proportion of their costsnot primarily determined by UK price levels.    The outturn0/81 external financing requirement of  101 million is&apos;thereforeed on BNOCs deflator.    BNOC make no separate pay assumption,ce their pay bill represents less than 1% of their costs.herto, BNOCs outturn, external financing requirement has notmally counted as a cash limit.    BNOC has been seen asQue among public sector corporations in the extent to whichP constituents of its external financing requirement are notbin its control.    Its revenues depend entirely on flows offrom fields, which cannot be increased at will; on thea? price of oil, which is detex-mined outside the United Kingdompnnental Shelf; and on the sterling/dollar exchange rate,rthermore, a large proportion of BNOCs capital expenditurecontractually determined by its partners in developing-as.   Since BNOCs pay bill is such a small proportion oflr costs, a cash limit would not constrain increases.
TISH STEEL C.OEPOEATIONCorporation are ready to accept an external financing limit 450m which corresponds to an assumption of break-even on thefit and loss account. . This figure has been prescribed by theretary of State rather derived from projections of operatingsuits.   The Corporation are assuming increases of aboutper cent in prices and 5 per cent in pay, any furthercreaent in pay levels being covered by self financing productivity&apos;als.   (ISTCs claim is in excess of 20%, but the Corporationan to hold firm.)   With staff levels being steadily reduced,is should mean that real unit wage costs v/ill fall:    but there!a risk that they will rise if the market deteriorates further&apos;d BSC are unable to match capacity to demand in the short run.The main threat to the limit comes from the poor marketospects, exacerbated by the effect of a strong pound. Therporation would be reluctant to switch cash from capitalvestment to fund losses, but a faster contraction wouldcrease immediate cash needs to finance redundancy and closurests.   Some upward revision in the limit might well be thecferable course if contraction has to be accelerated, in orderreduce the requirement for external finance in later years.
STOFFICEcause of the telecommunications billing backlog the Post Office11 get a windfall benefit in 1980-81 (matching their79/80 excess) currently put at nearly  400m, but liable toange by quite large amounts.    Officials recommend that theIternal financing limit should be set net of this windfall andould be later adjusted to take account of it, when the precisejure is known.The proposed Post Office cash limit of  65m assumes a yearyear increase of 1J% in the RP.I, and an 11% basic pay increase&apos;.r both Businesses, which when added to the restructuring paycreases already agreed this year gives a total pay increase; 15.8% for Posts and 18.5% for telecommunications.    On thisasis, and with constant staff numbers, real costs per unitf output will rise in the postal services, although theyhould continue to fall in telecommunications and there should beone longer term benefits from restructuring.The proposed limit is  85m higher than the July decision.Ms reflects:i. The impact on costs of the computer billingdispute (in which the unions gained nothing);ii. The need in telecommunications to avoid damageto the supplier industry, and the Post Office desireto avoid tariff increases which they consider wouldbe prejudicial to the future of the business.view of the facts that inflation has probably been underestimatedthat higher costs can only be recovered with a time lag, the^airman would strongly resist &apos;any lower figure.
TISII AIRWAYSDepartment of Trade officials propose an external financing limit ofOin.   This reflects a projection of BA&apos;s trading results whichowe for increases of 15% and about an 8% increase in basicoffset by 5% staff reductions, reversing past corporate policymaintaining employment stable (despite overmanning). Thuslunit wage costs should fall, meeting Ministers&apos; stipulation.Such a limit would be  15m above Ministers1  (revalued) Julyeision on the investment and financing review.    The interveningiod has seen a sharp rise in fuel costs, a matter outsides control, worsening their cash flow by some  66rn - a problemcerbated by the Civil Aviation Authority&apos;s cutting by  30mgrounds of BA&apos;s low productivity) proposed fare increases&apos;ch would have helped offset these increases.    Thus a  220msh limit would mean a real squeeze on both pay and investment,reover BA are at risk from further fuel price rises, both -rectly in their effect on costs and indirectly in their effecttraffic volumes.Treasury Officials on the other hand, while recognisinge risks from higher costs and possible difficulties on pay,flsider that the difficulties BA face are similar to those faceda number of other industries, and that a lower limit of05m would be consistent with Ministers&apos; July decisions. Theyte, however, that in order to keep within it the airline mightl&apos;e to sell a new aircraft, with repercussive effects onwitability, and again, on privatisation prospects.
ITISH AIRPORTS AUTHORITYe BAA external financing limit of  20m is in line with theecision taken by Ministers in July on the investment andnancing review entailing a cut of  20m (outturn prices). Thethority are assuming that the RPI will increase by 15%1980-81, and pay by 16%.    Since traffic is now expectedincrease by only 2% next year, a marked reduction one trend of recent years, and staff levels wall remain constantespite a planned upward trend over the medium term, thereould be a marginal decrease in real unit wage costs. Theeck in growth prospects and hence revenue could put pressurethe cash limit; the remedy would be a further increase iniding charges, already planned to rise sharply towardsonoraic levels.
TISH RAILI; July decisions envisaged total external finance (excluding pay-ts toward pensions) of  534 million at 1979 Survey prices -0 million operating grants,  34- million borrowing andsing.   BR current forecasts indicate an external financingquirement in the range  520-550 million.    These figures rest onsumptions of a 19-6 per cent fares increase in January 1980elding a 15*5 per cent increase in revenue), year on yearcreases in the general price level and in the pay bill ofper cent and 14 per cent respectively, and some modestowth in the level of economic activity.practice the risks are heavily down-side.    The size of thenuary fares increase&apos;has already been settled; the netnefit in 1980-81 of a further 10 per cent fares increase inpteraber 1980 would be unlikely to be more than about 2^- pernt ( 20 million) of passenger revenue (since it would do nore than bring forward some part of the fares increase due infiuary 1981).   Moreover BR are markedly more optimistic aboutsiness prospects than the latest Treasury forecasts.have limited scope for action to offset the deteriorationtheir business performance.    Investment has already been cutck well below what the Board believe to be required to maintaine present physical capability in the medium term.    Some costAuctions through cuts in services (and perhaps acceleratedsures of lines in rural areas) may be possible, but theseuld pose serious industrial relations problems.    And withrevenue covering only 60 per cent of passenger costs, andssenger resistance to fares increases very strong, it will be very difficultr BR to stay within a cash limit equivalent to the Julycision of  706 million; the Department of Transport thinkt it would be unsafe to set-the limit lower than  750 millionout-turn prices.
ITISH TRANSPORT DOCKS BOAEDDB is profitable and has a positive cash flow; profitsbstantially exceed capital requirements.    BTDB is currentlypaying prematurely its outstanding HLF debt, and at the sameme paying about  8&apos;million a year in corporation tax. Thely decisions implied a negative external financing limit ofmillion,DB ports account for about 25 per cent of UK traffic, and theiices and costs (including wage costs) are substantiallyfluenced by developments at other ports.    The Board&apos;s latestrecasts suggest that they might be able to accept a negativeEdit of  10 million; but they would find it hard to producey ciore cash.    They argue that their scope for raising pricesre than their competitors is limited, and that they alreadyke every effort to reduce costs and raise productivity. .tempts to restrict wage increasesfurther could lead to damagindustrial action which would put the cash limit objectiveyond reach, while reductions in investment, besides damaginghire prospects, would increase their tax bill.view of the relatively poor prospects for UK output andtonal trade in 1980-81, and of the Board&apos;s good record ine successful management of its ports, it would be unwise to&apos;ly on BTDB achieving more than is imp He d by a negative limit 10 million.
TISH WATERWAYS BOARDtal external finance for BWB is primarily determined by theze of their deficit grant in aid.    A limited amount of borrowingances a small investment programme.    The July decisions,ter volume cuts on both grant and borrowing, imply an externalancing limit of  22 million at Survey prices, of which  19 milliongrant.*out-turn prices this would imply a limit of  29 million ofich approximately  25 million would be grant.    The Board argueat grant at this level would not allow them to meet the additionalsts of a pay award to staff following a recommendation of .e Clegg Commission (expected at the end of the year) without arther volume squeeze.    The Board&apos;s assumption is thategg increases may average 20-25 per cent, costing  1 millionus in 1980-81.    The scope for the Board to finance theseditional payments without a further cut in their maintenanceogramrae already in arrears is limited.    The Board have assumedcreases in amenity charges ,of 17-18 per cent and charges foreight business are determined by their competitive position,erall, revenue from charges is only 40 per cent of turnover.would be inconsistent with the treatment of Clegg awards inIculating the RSG cash limit not to make some adjustment toe cash grant figure.    We therefore propose a cash limit ofJO million to include an allowance for Clegg.    The size ofwould not be specified but would be of the order of  1 million.
IOIJAL FREIGHT CORPORATIONer present arrangements NFC have no access to the NLF, and haverely (apart from certain specific Government grants) on hankrowing and leasing.    The Corporation1 s total net outstandingsing commitment is held constant in real terms (ie, newsing contracts can be entered into only to the extent thatvious contracts come to an end).   Ministers decided in Julyt total external finance for NFC in 1980-81 should beiricted to  19 million.C assume that the road haulage industry will in generalable to recover increases in wage and other costs through-her charges, so that their forecast of cash flow is notcially dependent on the movements of these variables (bye same token the cash limit, has less leverage over payttlements, where in effect the Corporation have to pay theing rate in the industry).    Their latest forecast of theirternal financing requirement is  24 million at out-turnices, although this could be higher if there were a markedceleration in inflation or a sharp down-turn in economictivity.   The NFC figure is about  1 &quot;million less than Ministers&apos;ly decision would imply at out-turn prices.    NFC would haveope for reducing investment and for a more rapid rationalisationsome operations if a deterioration in their trading positionreatened a cash limit breach.    A limit of  24- million att-turn prices ( 18 million at Survey prices) is thereforeoposed.
NATIONAL BUS COMPANY[Total external finance for. NBC depends in part on Governmentdecisions (on borrowing and amounts of New Bus Grant) and in part!0n local authority decisions on the amount of revenue supporty v/ill provide.    The external financing limit has to make anassumption about the latter; once it is fixed, permissibleborrowing in principle fluctuates inversely with the level oflocal authority revenue support.    The Department of Transportssumed initially that NBC would suffer reductions of  2 millionm new bus grant, in local authority revenue support (ie, asresult of the central Government squeeze on local authorityexpenditure) and in borrowing from central Government (as theirshare of the  20 million reduction in lending to the Transportnationalised industries.)this basis the NBC external financing limit would be  77 million.2 now say they need  87 million.    We think that they are allowingfor too small a fares increase next year (12-J per cent increase inrevenue, implying perhaps 14- per cent on fares), and that theycould make savings by a, more determined effort to rationalisecut back services.    There may be some scope for reductionsin investment in additional to those already implied in the IFEseliae.   But the benefit of such action in cash limit termsis restricted by the heavy redundancy costs of reductions, inservices in rural areas.    The Treasury considers NBC should bed to a cash limit of  77 million at out-turn prices, althoughlllis night need to be supplemented by an understandingthat somee*cess might be allowed to meet the additional redundancytosts of slimming down operations: the Department of Transportthinks that a figure below  85 million would be unrealistic.CONFIDE N
TUSH TRANSPORT GROUPin the case of the National Bus Company total external financepends in part on Government decisions on borrowing and New Busant and in part on local authority decisions on the level ofvenue support.the basis of SDD&apos;s assumptions about-the size of cuts inw Bus Grant, local authority support and the cut in borrowing&apos;,cash limit of  8.3 million at out-turn prices would be implied.Never, the Group say they need a further  0.3 million in thesh limit to accommodate expected grant recipts to cover urgentdunexpected repairs on the Port Ellen Pier.    These grants willfinanced from within existing public expenditure totals. Anternal financing limit of  8.6 million is therefore proposed.
ITISH SHIPBUILDERSUowing their review of shipbuilding Ministers agreed in Juneat the total external finance for British Shipbuilders in580-81 should be  101 million at 1979 Survey prices. Assumingflation of about 14 per cent between this year and next, this isquivalent to  153m at outturn prices.    BS1 s provisionalid is for  175 million.    The increase reflects revised assumptionsnut the likely price of ships, of carrying spare capacity andf closures.    It allows for an increase of up to 10% inarnings from January 1980.  175m would be unacceptable, andapartment of Industry Ministers will be making separateecomaendations as soon as possible.    In the meantime theable shows  130 million as the provisional limit.

FRAMEWORK OF FINANCIAL DISCIPLINEFOR THEPUBLIC SECTOR CORPORATIONSVIEWS OF THENATIONALISED INDUSTRIES&apos;  CHAIRMEN&apos;S GROUPj t*L.October. 1979
SUMMARY(i) The Chairmen1 s Group welcomes the Governments broad approach to thecontrol of the public sector industries,  ie to set a tight frameworkof financial discipline, but then to leave it to the Corporations tochoose between the various business options available within thoseconstraints.     However, much will depend on the ways in which thatframework of financial discipline is composed and operated,(paras. *l-3).(ii) In devising any system, full account will need to be taken of the manydifferences between the Corporations, (para 4).(iii) Any framework of financial discipline should embrace all the financialmechanisms through which the Government controls or influences theCorporations.     Seven such factors are identified, (para 5).(iv) The various parts of the financial framework must be operated inmutually consistent ways, (paras 6-8).(v) If these large, capital intensive businesses, with their long &quot;leadtimes&quot;, are to be directed successfully, they need strategic guidelinescovering a reasonable number of years.      Important though they are,short-terra cash flow considerations alone cannot provide a realisticform of strategic guidance.      Thus, the medium-term Financial Targetsshould be treated as the determining element within the financialframework, to which all other parts of the system should conform,(paras 9-11).(vl) Arrangements for the setting of Financial Targets are discussed, (paras12-16).     All Corporations should be given Financial Targets beforeCash Limits for 1980/81 are set, (para 17).(vii) Although its role within the financial framework should not beoverstated (para 10), the Cash Limits regime is a useful reinforcementfor financial targetry, (para 18).(viii) Because of their character as business enterprises, the Corporationshave &quot;cash limits&quot; of a special sort, related not to their totalspending, but to their external financing requirements, ie to thelimited differences between total receipts and total out-goings, (para19).     To emphasise this distinction, a more accurate description, suchas External Financing Limits, should be used, (para 20). Thedifferences involved must affect the ways in which the Corporations&apos;external financing limits are set, (paras 22-26); the timing of theexercise, (paras 27-28); and the results which the Cash Limits regimecan reasonably be expected to achieve in the industrial area, (paras29-31).Ux) The time has come to spell out clearly how the Cash Limits regime ismeant to operate in the case of the Corporations, (paras 32-33). TheNICCs detailed suggestions for such a Code of Practice are set out,(paras 34-35 and Appendix).(x) As well as Financial Targets and Cash Limits, five other factors should,be covered in the framework of financial discipline.      The NICCs viewsare set out with regard to: devices to stimulate efficiency, (paras 36-38); pricing policy, (paras 39-40); investment approvals andappraisals, (paras 41-45); capital structure and financing, (para 46);and the treatment of inflation, (paras 47-50).
-ItNATIONALISED INDUSTRIES1 CHAIRMEN&apos;S GROUPFRAMEWORK OF FINANCIAL DISCIPLINEAs the Chairmen&apos;s Group understands it, the Governments broad approachto the control of the public sector industries falls into two inter-relatedparts.     The first involves providing the Corporations with a tight&quot;framework of financial control&quot;, akin to the constraints imposed onprivate sector companies by the operation of a tight monetary policy. Thesecond involves then standing back as far as possible, reducing detailedinterventions and leaving to the Boards of the Corporation the task ofchoosing between the various business options available within thosefinancial constraints.The Nationalised Industries&apos; Chairmen&apos;s Group welcomes this broad approach,which is very much in tune with the views which the Group itself hasdeveloped over the years.In practice, however, much will depend on the way in which this overallapproach is translated into specific arrangements.     During theMinisterial-NICG Liaison Meeting on 23 July, 1979, the Chancellor of theExchequer expressed his readiness to receive the Chairmen&apos;s Group&apos;s viewson this issue. Accordingly, this paper sets out the NICG&apos;s thinking aboutthe form which any framework of financial discipline should take, as acontribution to debate.In devising and operating any framework of financial discipline, fullaccount will need to be taken of the many differences between theCorporations.     Of the twenty businesses linked with the Chairmen&apos;s Groupwhich are responsible to Ministers, three - the National Water Council,the Civil Aviation Authority and the UKAEA - are not dealt with as&quot;nationalised industries&quot; for the purposes of the Cash Limits regime,though they are subject to that restraint through another route, and alsoto other parts of the overall financial control system.     And as to theremaining seventeen Corporations, these differ substantially in manyrelevant respects, such as their organisational structures, theirindustrial characteristics, their current financial situations, and theextent to which their market situations allow them to influence theirselling prices.     Though this need to make allowance for individualcircumstances is specifically referred to at certain points in this paper,it applies throughout.A : THE OVERALL FRAMEWORKTHE COMPONENTS&apos; The framework of financial discipline should be so designed as to providean environment in which public sector Corporations operating at reasonablelevels of efficiency are able to achieve an adequate level of profit. Itshould embrace all the financial mechanisms through which the Governmentcontrols or influences the activities of the Corporations, as developed inthe 1961, 1967 and 1978 White Papers, (Cmnd.1337,3437 and 7131).      It wouldthus consist of arrangements relating to:- Financial Targets - Pricing Policy- Cash Limits - Investment Approvals and Appraisals- Efficiency - Capital Structure and Financing- The Treatment of Inflation
- 3 -INTERNAL CONSISTENCYIf the mechanisms referred to in paragraph 5 are to be combined to providea framework of financial discipline, it is essential that the various partsshall be operated in such a way as to be mutually consistent, one with theother.This has not always been so in the past.    The most acute problems haveconcerned the inter-relationship between pricing policy and the priceimplications of Financial Targets and Cash Limits, where confusions andconflicts abounded during the existence of the Price Commission. However,this has not been the only area of difficulty.     There have been many otherinstances where either there have been direct clashes, eg. Corporationshave been given Cash Limits which were altogether inconsistent with theachievement of their Financial Targets, or no positive attempts appearto have been made to check consistency., eg. as between the Cash Limits setand agreed investment programmes.Looking to the future, the Government&apos;s decision to abandon direct pricerestraint should serve to reduce the difficulties which have occurred vis-a-vis pricing policy, but it will not necessarily remove this problemaltogether, (see paragraph 40 below).     Moreover, the current additionalemphasis on short-term Cash Limits threatens to create a whole.catalogueof new internal inconsistencies if pursued too far and in any unduly rigidway.     Excessive stress on the cash limit objective could weaken ratherthan strengthen the Corporations1 present determination to resistunreasonable pay demands since prolonged strikes can have an enormousimpact on cash flow, as recent Post Office experience demonstrates.Similarly, the inflexible application of Cash Limits may impede plannedreductions in manning by squeezing the room for manoeuvre in the timing ofredundancy payments; lead to the loss of favourable purchasingopportunities; restrict investment in ways which block the achievement ofmedium-term Financial Targets; and so on.THE LEADING ROLE OF FINANCIAL TARGETSIf internal consistency is to be maintained, one of the mechanisms makingup the framework of financial discipline will need to be recognised asplaying the &quot;lead role&quot; in the system, to which the others will conform.The Chairmen&apos;s Group urges very strongly that the Financial Targets shouldfill this role.This choice is determined by the industrial characteristics of the publicsector businesses.     Only medium-term Targets of this sort can provide theBoards of the Corporations with the sort of strategic guidance which theyneed to pull together into a consistent whole all the various policiesbearing on the future development of their enterprises.     The Chairmen&apos;sGroup fully appreciates both the immediate and the wider reasons why theCash Limits regime has come to play such a major role in Ministerialthinking.       Nevertheless, it cannot seriously be argued that the directionof these very large, capital-intensive businesses, with their long &quot;leadtimes&quot;, should be determined by reference to short-term cash flowconsiderations alone.     To attempt to do so would risk producing violentswings in policy from year to year, eg. with regard to price changes orinvestment expenditure, with seriously destabilising effects on customers,staff and suppliers alike.     If these major national businesses are tomaintain a steady course, they must steer by a more distant mark.
- 4 -The Chairmen&apos;s Group therefore advises:a. The Financial Targets laid down for the Corporations should be regardedas the determining factor in the framework of financial discipline.b. As far as possible, the cash limits set for any year should be based onthe best available estimates of what external financing requirementswill emerge for the Corporations concerned as they pursue their medium-term Financial Targets in the light of their short-term marketcircumstances.     In other words, the cash limits should primarily bederivative figures.     Obviously, since the setting of Cash Limits ispart of the Government&apos;s wider PESC exercise, Ministers mayoccasionally find it impracticable to refrain from adjusting thefigures so derived to some extent, in,the light of the Government&apos;s ownshort-term financial constraints; but this should be avoided if at allpossible, because of the disruptive effects on the businesses, andtheir customers and suppliers.c. Any interventions on prices by the Government, or by the governmentalagencies concerned with Competition Policy, should be subordinated tothe need to carry through in good time the price changes required toachieve the Financial Targets and Cash Limits set, (though theCorporations can reasonably be expected to demonstrate that they arealso taking all possible steps to improve efficiency).B : FINANCIAL TARGETSFormal Basis.     The Corporations1  statutory duties with regard to theconduct of their businesses, including their financial duties, are laiddown in the various Nationalisation Acts.     These statutory duties cannotbe ignored in any discussion of Financial Targets and Cash Limits. Thosetwo arrangements represent very important expressions of Ministerialwishes, to which all Corporations give great weight; but they are non-statutory in character, and so do not over-ride, or impose, legalobligations.Relevant Considerations.     Two main sets of factors should be taken intoaccount when determining Financial Targets.     The Corporation concernedshould be able to put forward all those considerations which it judgesrelevant in terms of the development of its business and the environment inwhich it expects to have to operate.     And the Government will naturallywish to introduce wider-ranging matters, such as the implications foreconomic and monetary policy, the impact of sectoral policies whereappropriate, (eg., for the energy and transport Corporations), and so on.The &quot;opportunity cost&quot; of capital is certainly a relevant factor whendetermining Financial Targets; but how best it can be taken into accountin practice is a matter still needing to be discussed on an industry-by-industry basis at this stage, (see also paras.44-45).     Where there hasbeen a wide-ranging examination of a Corporations long term corporatestrategy, as in coal, the whole process of determining an appropriateraedium-terni Financial Target is obviously made much easier.,Form^of the Targets.     The Chairmen&apos;s Group supported the declaration inlast year&apos;s White Paper on the Nationalised Industries that, &quot;A financialgarget must obviously be tailored to the circumstances of a particularindustry,&quot; (Cmnd.7131, para.70).     It has welcomed the fact that theargets so far announced have, accordingly, varied appreciably in form,Reflecting the widely differing business situations of the Corporations.
Time Span.     The Financial Targets set must cover a medium-term period ifthey are to provide the Corporations with a useful measure of strategicguidance.     The period should normally be of the order of three years,possibly ranging up to as much as five years, depending on the situation inthe industries concerned.     In no circumstances should there be arecurrence of the situation whereby one-year Targets were laid down forBritish Gas Corporation and the Electricity Council for 1979/80.     Though afundamental change in circumstances may occasionally necessitate therevision of some particular Target in mid-term, the annual review procedureshould normally be used as a monitoring mechanism only.Consultation.     The Chairmen1s Group attached great importance to thepromise in Cmnd.7131 that the Government would set Financial Targets afterconsultation with the Corporations concerned.    However, actual experienceto date has been mixed; eg, while some Corporations have been fullyinvolved by their Departments, there was virtually no discussion at allprior to the setting of a Target for British Gas Corporation early thisyear.     Unless there is full advance discussion, officials may be less thanadequately aware of all the factors which are relevant in terms of thedevelopment of the industries concerned; and conversely, if those engagedin the Corporations are left unaware of the wider considerations ofeconomic or sectoral policy which have influenced the Government&apos;sdecisions, they can hardly then be expected to demonstrate a full sense ofcommitment to the Targets set.Coverage.     Useful progress has been made in the setting of medium-termTargets since the appearance of Cmnd.7131 in March, 1978.     However, thecoverage is still incomplete, with some major Corporations being amongstthose still lacking such guidance.     The Government should seek to provideall Corporations with medium term Financial Targets before attempting todefine Cash Limits for 1980/81.THE CASH LIMITS REGIMEThe Chairmen&apos;s Group would be seriously concerned at any attempt to useshort-term cash control as the predominant technique for guiding theoperations of the public sector industries, since their industrialcharacteristics call for longer-term strategic guidance, (see paragraph10).     The Corporations&apos; &quot;cash limits&quot; should be seen, rather , primarilyas derivative figures, reflecting whatever external financing requirementsemerge as the various businesses pursue their medium-term Financial Targetsin the light of their short-term market circumstances.     Though theGovernment may occasionally find it impracticable to refrain from adjustingthe derived figures to some extent in the light of its own short-termfinancial constraints, this should be avoided if at all possible, becauseQf the disruptive effects on the businesses, and on their customers andsuppHers, (see paragraph lib).      If they are approached in this way - ie,seen as a useful reinforcement for financial targetry - the Group believesthat the one-year Cash Limits can introduce a valuable additional elementof financial discipline into the operations of the public sectorCorporations.
THE SPECIAL, CHARACTER OF THE CORPORATIONS&apos;  CASH LIMITSThe White Paper on &quot;Cash Limits on Public Expenditure&quot;, (Cmnd.6440,April, 1976), acknowledged from the start the basic difference in characterbetween the Departments and other non-trading organisations and theCorporations as commercial enterprises, and accepted that the latterrequired altogether-different treatment.     In this area, cash control wasto be applied only to the balancing element in the Corporations&apos; totalincome-expenditure patterns, ie to their external financing requirements,as met by medium and long term borrowings, irrespective of source, PublicDividend Capital and grants.The use of the same term to cover both the restrictions imposed on theDepartments1  total expenditures and those imposed on the Corporation&apos;sexternal financing requirements tends to obscure the important differencesinvolved, and so encourages misunderstandings and misjudgements. TheChairmen1 s Group sees merit in the suggestion that a different, and moreaccurate, term than &quot;cash limits&quot; should be employed in relation to theCorporations&apos; figures, such as &quot;External Financing Requirements&quot; or&quot;External Financing Limits&quot;.CONSEQUENTIAL DIFFERENCESThe fact that the Corporations are business enterprises, and the specialcharacter of their &quot;cash limits&quot; which stems from this, have importantimplications.     Compared to the operation of the Cash Limits regime in thecase of the Departments, three main consequential differences arise.These affect the way in which the Corporations1  external financing limitsshould be determined; the timing of the exercise; and the results which canreasonably be expected to arise from the use of this form of discipline inthe public sector industries.Determining the Cash LimitsThe method employed to decide on what cash limits should be set for theCorporations must inevitably be more complicated than in the case of theDepartments.     This is because the Corporations1 expectations about theirexternal financing requirements are derived from complex business planswhich embrace all aspects of their operations, covering not only plans forcurrent expenditures, but also expectations about their revenues, theircapital spending plans, and so on.     Thus, the Government cannot come toany realistic view on the Corporations&apos; estimates of their externalfinancing requirements without first examining these wider aspects of theirunderlying business plans in considerable detail.     The letters receivedfrom Ministers in early October about the setting of the Corporations&apos; cashlimits for 1980/81 appear to accept this point in principle.Such an approach carries, however, one important implication.     The CashLimits regime may allow Ministers to distance themselves from theCorporations&apos; business decision after the Cash Limits have been set; but^hile they are being set, the operation of the system draws Departmentsinexorably into some degree of involvement in the most sensitive areas ofusiness planning.     And such involvement must, in turn, inevitably lead tosome degree of commitment as regards the principal assumptionsunderpinning the Corporations&apos; business plans.
- 7 -This is certainly the case with regard to the assumptions made about futureprice changes.     For most Corporations, there is a direct connectionbetween the views which they take about the extent and the timing ofprice increases in the year ahead and the scale of the external financingwhich they expect to have to recruit.     Thus, the Government cannotreasonably proceed on the basis of the latter figures but then claim to bealtogether uncommitted with regard to the anticipated price changes whichunderlie them.Assumptions about pay increases affect forecasts of external financingrequirements to a lesser extent.     Nevertheless, the link is close enoughto make it impracticable for Ministers to avoid taking a view on whatlevel of pay increases will be regarded as acceptable for the purposes ofthe cash limit calculations, whatever their general policy may be about thesetting of wage norms.     The letters received from Ministers in earlyOctober about the setting of cash limits for 1980/81 appear to acceptthis point in principle.In the light of these considerations, the Chairmen&apos;s Group makes twoproposals, (see Appendix, paras A13-A14 and A21).    Firstly, when Ministersdefine the Corporations1 cash limits for the year ahead, there should be anaccompanying exchange of letters setting out the principal assumptionswhich underlie the figures set and identifying responsibility for them.Secondly, if assumptions for which Ministers bear responsibility aresubsequentially proved appreciably wrong by the course of events, theCorporations affected should have the right to ask the Government either toreconsider their external financing limits, or alternatively, to accept theneed for whatever action is necessary to enable them to stay within thoselimits.TimingThe fact that the Governments annual round of PESC discussions iscompleted some months ahead of the Corporation&apos;s business planningexercises has always involved the risk that the Corporations&apos; Cash Limitswould be set prematurely, on the basis of early, tentative data abouttheir likely external financing requirements, (see Appendix, para A17).However, the Governments efforts to expedite this year&apos;s PESC exercise hasmade the issue one of urgency.     If matters proceed at the pace suggestedin the letters received from Ministers in early October, and a White Paperformally laying down the Corporations&apos; external financing limits for1980/81 is published in November, there is a serious risk that the figureswill be out of line with the Corporations&apos; needs.     If so, the problemslikely to face both the Government and the industries in connection withthe Cash Limits regime next year could be considerably and unnecessarilyaggravated.Against this background, one possible solution merits attention, (Appendix,para   A19).     This suggests that, although all discussions on theCorporations&apos; external financing requirements for 1980/81 should naturallycontinue to be handled on an individual basis, the initial White Paper onfuture public expenditure plans projected for November should show only onetotal Cash Limits figure for the nationalised industries as a whole,leaving the figures for individual Corporations to be determined finallynearer Budget-time, on the basis of the more up-to-date appraisals of theireternal financing requirements for 1980/81 due to be submitted byCorporations in February.     This course would not only help to reduce theChairmen&apos;s Group&apos;s anxieties about the current, expedited review, but mightalso cover a longer-term point of concern about the Corporations&apos;Influence on the PESC exercise which NICG was discussing with the then-Chancellor at the time of the change of Government.
- 8 - &quot;Ukely ResultsSince the cash limits set for the Corporations are related to theirexternal financing limits only, they are normally small in comparison withthe total expenditures, and total revenues involved*.    In other words, asapplied in the public sector industries, the Cash Limits regime involvesrelying on very short levers to try to shift very heavy weights.    Both forthis reason and since other practical limitations also apply//, the resultswill, inevitably, be less direct and less certain than in the case of theDepartments, where the regime directly limits total spending.    To theextent that the system helps to strengthen the Boards&apos;  hands in theirconstant efforts to impose financial disciplines, both inside theirbusinesses and in relation to suppliers and Unions, it is a welcomereinforcement.     However, the Chairmen&apos;s Group believes that Ministerswould be unwise to exaggerate the results which can reasonably be expectedto flow from this form of discipline in the particular circumstances of thepublic sector industries.With regard to the likely impact on pay in particular, much the sameconclusion applies.     To the extent that the existence of cash limits helpsto restrain Unions&apos; ambitions, the benefit is to be welcomed.    However, thestudies which NICG has made indicate the many technical weaknesses of theCash Limits regime as a restraint on wage bargaining; and the Unions willprobably increasingly come to appreciate the room for manoeuvre which theseweaknesses allow.     In general, the Chairmen&apos;s Group has appreciable doubtsabout the effectiveness of cash limits as a device for significantlyrestraining pay increases in the public sector industries.     Moreover, ithas considerable misgivings about the likely consequences for industrialrelations of any attempt to introduce discriminatory restraints, affectingpublic sector pay movements alone.At the Ministerial-NICG Liaison Meeting on 23 July, 1979, the Chairmen&apos;sGroup was asked whether it would help to make the impact of cash limitsmore direct, and hence more certain, if the limits were sub-divided in someway, eg as between revenue and capital items, or between pay, other revenueitems and capital items.   Whatever the merit of such an approach might befor the Departments, it would appear impracticable in the particularcircumstances of the Corporations: in every case, their external financinglimits cover only a small proportion of total out-goings; and in mostcases, other limitations also apply//.DETAILED ARRANGEMENTSThe detailed arrangements for the operation of the Cash Limits regime inthe case of the public sector industries have developed on an ad hoc basisover the past four years, and current practice is nowhere codified.While this may have been inevitable while the system was being built up, itis undesirable now that the Cash Limits regime has become one of the maindevices through which the Government regulates the activities of the publicsector industries.* Eg, British Airways&apos;  total out-goings for 1978/79, including capitalspending, totalled  1,735 million.     Its cash limit was  59 million.t For 1979/80, out of 17 Corporations, 5 are expected to be fully self-financing, with nil or negative cash limits; and if credit is taken forlocal authority and special Government grants, another 9 have cash limitswholly related to the financing of their agreed capital programmes.
- 9 -The Chairmen&apos;s Group believes that the time has come to spell out clearlyhow the Cash Limits regime is meant to operate in the case of theCorporations, in the form of a Code of Practice.     Though this should bedesigned to apply to all Corporations as far as possible, it would need toinclude provisions to deal with the special circumstances of individualCorporations in certain instances.The NICCs general views about the form of the Cash Limits regime havealready been stated in paragraph lib above.     For any Corporation, itsmedium-term Financial Target should be regarded as &quot;the determining factorin its framework, of financial discipline&quot;.     That having been laid down:&quot;The cash limits set for any year should be based on the best availableestimates of what external financing requirements will emerge for theCorporations concerned as they pursue their medium-term FinancialTargets In the light of their short-term market circumstances. Inother words, the cash limits should primarily be derivative figures.Obviously, since the setting of Cash Limits is part of theGovernments wider PESC exercise, Ministers may occasionally find itimpracticable to refrain from adjusting the figures so derived to someextent, in the light of the Governments own short-term financialconstraints; but this should be avoided if at all possible, because ofthe disruptive effects on the businesses, and on their customers andsuppliers&quot; .The Chairmen&apos;s Group&apos;s more detailed suggestions about the form of theproposed Code of Practice are set out at length in the Appendix.D : OTHER ELEMENTS IN THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORKEFFICIENCYResponsibility for ensuring that Corporations operate efficiently restsprimarily with their Boards.     This is not only a duty imposed on them byStatute, but also a matter of professional concern and professional pride.The Chairmen&apos;s Group is aware, however, that Ministers are activelyinterested in finding ways of reinforcing these internal pressures forefficiency.     In this connection, it has three general observations:-a.   Some of this Ministerial concern appears to stem from an implicitassumption that nationalised industries are immune from the normalcompetitive pressures making for greater efficiency.     This is not so.In an appreciable part of the nationalised sector, the Corporationsface considerable competition from other home and/or overseasbusinesses; and even in those industries where Parliament has longrecognised the inevitability of some limitation of direct competition,such as the public utilities, the individual Corporations faceappreciable market pressures from suppliers of alternative goods andservices.In-so-far as the Government sees need to reinforce such competitivepressures for efficiency, any action should, as far as possible, beindirect in character, such as the imposition of a framework offinancial discipline.c-   With regard to proposals for more direct action to improve efficiency,experience shows that, however well-intentioned, such initiatives canall too easily slip over into producing the sort of burdensome, time-consuming involvement of officials and consultants in the affairs ofthe Corporations which the Chairmen hoped that this Government was of amind to avoid.
- 10 -Nevertheless, despite its reservations, the Chairmen1s Group will naturallystand ready to consider, in a positive way, any new suggestions forstimulating efficiency in the public sector industries which Ministers maywish to put forward.Meanwhile, it needs to be borne in mind that a not-inconsiderable amount ofexperimentation is already under way in this area:-a. The last Governments proposal that the Corporations should providetheir Departments, on a regular basis, with information about theirachievements in terras of a range of agreed &quot;performance indicators&quot;,together with forward projections, is being actively pursued, (Cmnd.7131, para 77).b. Appreciable progress has already been made in connection with the lastGovernments further proposal that a certain amount of information ofthis nature should be made generally available through theCorporations&apos; Annual Reports and Accounts, (Cmnd.7131, para 78).c. The NEDO Study on the Nationalised Industries recommended that theFinancial Targets set for the public sector industries should includeperformance objectives as well as financial objectives, especiallywhere Corporations were in a position to exercise some degree ofmonopoly power, (pp.33 and 49).     However, last year&apos;s White Paper,while mentioning this suggestion, noticeably refrained from followingit up, (Cmnd.7131, para 76); and comparatively little has been done inthis regard by the Departments, apart from the recent elaboration ofthe Targets set for the Post Office*.     All this suggests that theproposal may involve appreciably greater difficulties than itssupporters appreciate.     For its part, the Chairmen&apos;s Group does notfeel that the experience yet available warrants its adopting anycollective stance on the idea at this stage, though it would not wishto discourage experiments on an industry-by-industry basis, where theChairmen concerned see advantages.d. Under the Competition Bill, the Secretary of State for Trade will beempowered to call on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission toinvestigate the efficiency, costs and standards of service of thepublic sector Corporations.     Certain initial points of concern havingbeen dealt with during discussions prior to the publication of theBill, the Chairmen&apos;s Group has not sought to resist this innovation.However, it remains worried about the burdens which such investigationswill involve; dubious about the benefits likely to accrue; andunconvinced about the capacity of the Monopolies and MergersCommission to carry out management audits of the sort envisaged in thetime allowed.* The Financial Target set for Telecommunications calls for a reduction inthe unit cost of telecommunication services of some 5% a year in realterms during the period 1978/79-1982/83, in addition to achieving a 5%return on net assets, revalued at replacement cost.    The Target set forpostal services requires them to maintain constant prices in real terms.Other Corporations have experimented with setting performance targets oftheir own: eg British Airports Authority&apos;s Accounts for 1978/79 recordthat It has set itself the tasks of increasing the number of passengershandled per employee by 3% a year, and of reducing expenditure perpassenger, before depreciation, by 2i% a year in real terms, over thenext five years.
PRICING POLICYIf it is accepted that a Corporation is operating reasonably efficiently,then the objectives which it is given in terms of Financial Targets andExternal Financing Limits will go a long way towards determining what levelof sales revenue it will require over the year ahead, and hence the amountand timing of any necessary changes in selling prices.     The pointobviously cannot be pressed too far.     Some Corporations, operating inhighly competitive environments, have little if any ability to adjust theirselling prices so as to realise given targets for profits and cash flow,and must operate almost entirely on the other side of the cost-pricerelationship.    And even for those Corporations which have some greaterdegree of market influence, many uncertainities may intervene.Nevertheless, it is essential that the Government should have a clearunderstanding of the implications for pricing of the Financial Targets andExternal Financing Limits which it sets.I, As paragraph 7 indicated, this has all too often not been the case in thepast.     Looking forward, the Governments welcome decision to abolish thePrice Commission and to abandon direct price restraints should serve toreduce the difficulties in future; but it does not necessarily remove theproblem altogether.     In particular, some potential areas of conflictremain vis-a-vis the statutory powers of the Director General of FairTrading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.     Although the newCompetition Bill requires the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to acceptany Financial Targets and Cash Limits laid down by Ministers as &quot;givendata&quot; in connection with its investigations into the efficiency of publicsector industries, the Bill does not extend that rule to other activitiesof the MMC, nor does It apply it to the activities of the Director Generalof Fair Trading.     Thus, there is need for procedures to be agreed betweenthe Government, the Corporations, the DGFT and the MMC for dealingeffectively and speedily with any proposals from the Corporations for priceincreases which stem from the setting of Financial Targets and Cash Limits.More generally, though the Chairmen1s Group is much encouraged by theevident determination of the present Government to avoid intervening incommercial issues, sad experience shows that the political pressures onMinisters to block necessary but unpopular public sector price increaseshave all too often eventually overcome good intentions in the past.INVESTMENT APPROVALS AND APPRAISALS&apos; The public sector industries have very large investment programmes, ofteninvolving individual projects with long &quot;lead times&quot;.     These programmescurrently involve capital outlays of well over  4 billion a year, accountfor about one-fifth of all of Britain1s investment in fixed assets, andprovide a work-load which is crucial for the well-being of many privatesector capital goods manufacturers.     It is thus essential from many anglesthat any framework of financial discipline should include arrangementswhich are capable of regulating this investment activity successfully.&apos; The existing arrangements in this field fall into two main parts. Thefirst involves annual reviews of the Corporations&apos; medium term investmentProgrammes by their sponsoring Departments, leading up to Ministerialauthorisations for certain percentages of the total levels of capitalsPending proposed in each of the first three years of the programmes, as abasis for the advance commitments needed to keep investment activitytunning smoothly.     These arrangements were examined in depth in 1975, anduseful changes made; and while there are specific points at whichimprovements could still be effected, the Chairmen&apos;s Group believes that&quot;ey can be incorporated without any substantial change in the frameworkof financial discipline.
- 12 -There Is, however, some uncertainty about the links between thisprocedure for future investment authorisations and the procedure forsetting Cash Limits. The Chairmen&apos;s Group would welcome an assurance that,once a forward capital spending programme has been authorised in whole orsubstantial proportion,  Cash Limits will be set for the years concerned ata level which makes full provision for the financing of that capitalspending.     Late revisions in capital spending programmes occasioned byinadequate cash limits can have extremely serious repercussions, not onlyon the Corporations themselves, but also on many private sector companiesin the capital goods industries, who are often heavily dependent on publicsector orders.The second set of arrangements bears on the likely profitability of thevarious projects making up those overall capital spending programmes. Theapproach set out in the 1967 White Paper, which revolved around theproposition that the profit prospects of each individual project should beappraised by use of the Test Discount Ratze (TDR) system, was dropped lastyear as a governmental requirement, and it was left to each Corporation todetermine its own methods of investment appraisal in future.     In itsplace, the 1978 White Paper proposed that the profitability of eachCorporations investment plans should henceforth be appraised in terms ofwhether its new capital outlays taken as a whole were likely to achieve asufficient return to cover the current &quot;opportunity cost of capital&quot; ,(identified as 5 per cent in real terms before tax); and it was indicatedthat this would become one of the factors to be taken into account indetermining Financial Targets, (Cmnd.7131, paras 57 and 60).      In addition,the White Paper put forward a new mechanism for implementing this newapproach, in the form of the Required Rate of Return (RRR) system, (paras60-63 and Appendix I).The Chairmen&apos;s Group accepted the &quot;opportunity cost of capital&quot; concept.Moreover, the strength of the general arguments advanced in favour of theRRR system as a technique for applying that concept was fully recognised.However, a number of Chairmen were hesitant about the practicability of theRRR system in terms of the particular industrial situations facing theirbusinesses, an aspect on which no serious studies had been done. NICG madeclear to the late Chancellor its reservations in this regard; and in theevent, the key sentence in Cmnd.7131 stated only that, &quot;The Government isdiscussing with (the Corporations) the development of a more directway of relating the opportunity cost of capital to their financialperformance in order to reinforce the principles of Cmnd.3437&quot;, (Para 60).The Chairmen&apos;s Group subsequently indicated to Ministers that, until thosediscussions had been completed and the results had been considered, theChairmen&apos;s Group would continue to reserve judgement on the use of the RRRsystem as a technique for applying the &quot;opportunity cost of capital&quot;concept.     That remains its position.CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCINGThe ability of the Corporations to operate satisfactorily within anyframework of financial discipline will depend in part on the existence ofsuitable arrangements with regard to their capital structures and theirfinancing.     At this stage, the Chairmen&apos;s Group wishes to reserve commenton any points of common concern which may emerge in these regards fromstudy of the various &quot;privatisation&quot; proposals being put forward by theGovernment.     However, it would still see advantage in discussions beingheld at officials level on the rather more detailed points raised in theMemorandum on &quot;Capital Structure and Sources of Finance&quot; which it submittedto the Treasury in February, 1979 and which has not yet been considered,rn these discussions, the NICG would wish to pursue, among other matters,ne current limitations on overdrafts and other forms of temporaryGrowings, and the treatment of leasing.
- 13 -THE TREATMENT OF INFLATIONLike all parts of the economy, the public sector Industries find theconduct of their affairs rendered increasingly difficult by the course ofinflation.     Indeed, since the Corporations&apos;  fixed assets are soconsiderable and often so long-lived, the impact of inflation on economicand financial relationships in the public sector industries is particularlysevere.     Any framework, of financial discipline must embrace arrangementsto cope with this aspect.     In particular, three points will requireattention.Pricing.     The level of prices charged by public sector Corporationsshould, wherever possible, be high enough to cover the full current costsof production, including the replacement cost of capital assets &quot;used up&quot;in the process of production.      Such prices cannot always be secured byCorporations facing highly competitive market situations.     However, unlessthe Government allows the use of full &quot;current cost&quot; pricing in situationswhere it Jj3 practicable, and makes its support for that policy widely knownin the community, it will be acquiescing in a progressive hidden erosion ofthe capital base of the Corporations concerned, and thereby aggravatingpublic sector financing problems in future years.Financial Targets.     Correspondingly, the Financial Targets set for theCorporations should, as far as possible, be expressed in terms which takeaccount of the impact of inflation.     This cannot yet be done across-the-board; but it is encouraging to note that nine of the Financial Targets setrecently have been expressed in this way.- Financial Accounts.     The Chairmen&apos;s Group and all individual Corporationshave accepted the statement included in last year&apos;s White Paper on theNationalised Industries that, &quot;when an inflation accounting standard isapproved, it will apply to the nationalised industries, subject to anynecessary adjustments to meet their special circumstances&quot;, (para.72).Earlier this year, NICG produced an Interim Code of Practice, designed toreduce the differences which had developed with regard to the treatment ofinflation in nationalised industries&apos; Accounts in the absence of anyauthoritative lead from the accountancy bodies.    Following on from this,NICG recently sent to the Treasury its analysis of the current proposalsfor a new Inflation Accounting Standard, as set out in Exposure Draft 24.It hopes that, after discussion, agreement can be reached on a jointstatement which the Government and the Chairmen&apos;s Group could make to theAccounting Standards Committee with regard to the application of such anAccounting Standard to the public sector industries, including anyadjustments judged necessary to meet their special circumstances.
- 14 -APPENDIXDETAILED ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CASH LIMITS REGIMEIN THE PUBLIC SECTOR INDUSTRIESParagraph 33 of the main paper states the Chairmen1s Group&apos;s view that &quot;thetime has come to spell out clearly how the Cash Limits regime is meant tooperate in the case of the Corporations, in the form of a Code ofPractice&quot;; and paragraph 34 then describes the NICG&apos;s general thinking onthis matter.     This Appendix elaborates on that approach.TERMINOLOGYThe term &quot;Cash Limits&quot; should be replaced by one which more accuratelydescribes the system as it applies to the Corporations, such as &quot;ExternalFinancing Requirements&quot; or &quot;External Financing Limits&quot;.RELEVANT INFORMATIONThree main types of information are necessary before Ministers canproperly decide on External Financing Limits:-a. The medium-term Financial Targets at which the Corporations should beaiming.b. The best available estimates of what individual Corporations are likelyto need by way of external financing in the next financial year.c. The Government&apos;s own assessment of the overall public sector financingsituation in the year ahead, leading on to initial views about thedesirable level of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, to whichthe total of the Corporations&apos; external financing requirementscontributes.As indicated in the main paper, the Chairmen&apos;s Group believes that thefirst of those items should be the principal factor affecting thesetting of Cash Limits.MACHINERY1 The Corporations already provide their sponsoring Departments withconsiderable information about their business plans for the year ahead.Though arrangements vary somewhat, returns are normally made in tentativeform in the Autumn, in reasonably complete form in the following February,and in final form shortly afterwards.    These several submissions show thebest estimates available at the time of the revenues and expenditures whichare likely to arise as the Corporations pursue their medium-term FinancialTargets in the light of the short-term business conditions anticipated; andSet out in detail all the background data and assumptions underlying thoseestlmates: and in the later versions, they also state what level ofeternal financing is likely to be required in the year ahead.From the Governments viewpoint, this information forms one of the manyinputs brought together in the annual PESC exercise.     The decisionsiowing from that exercise subsequently emerge in three main ways: in theannual White Paper on the Governments Five Year Expenditure Plans,formally been published in January in the past few years), which
- 15 -includes figures for the nationalised industries&apos; external borrowingrequirements in the next financial year, in total and by individualCorporations;  in the Estimates put to Parliament, (which are now beingbrought into line with the Cash Limits set for the correspondingDepartmental &quot;blocks&quot;); and in the Budget, and the accompanying BudgetStatement and Financial Review.The formal status of the figures showing external borrowing requirementsfor individual Corporations which are included in the White Paper on Five-Year Expenditure Plans has never been clearly defined; but theauthoritative statement of Cash Limits for the public sector industriesfor the coming year is normally taken to be that appearing at Budget-timein the Financial Statement and Budget Review.     This covers 17 of the 21Corporations linked with NICG, with the exceptions being the National WaterCouncil, Civil Aviation Authority and UKAEA, (whose position is dealt withthrough the Cash Limits set for their Departments), and London TransportExecutive.IA7. The Chairmen&apos;s Group is generally satisfied with this existing machinery.Its main reservation, reflecting a considerable anxiety about timing, isindicated in paragraphs A15-A19 below.THE PROCESS OF DECISION-MAKINGDecisions on the Corporations&apos; External Financing Limits are a matter forthe Government, albeit for practical rather than statutory reasons.However, Ministers cannot expect the Boards of the Corporations to carryresponsibility for operating their very large enterprises successfullyunless a major element in their business plans - their access to externalfinancing - is determined in a way which pays adequate regard to theBoards&apos; own judgements of their needs.The setting of the Corporations&apos; External Financing Limits ought thus to bepreceded by full consultation, involving the normal process of successivediscussions, leading to successive adjustments in views, until figures arereached which are tolerable both in terms of the Corporations&apos; position ascommercial entities and in terms of the Governments judgement of overallnational priorities. Considerable concern has been caused by the factthat Cash Limits for 1979/80 were revised in March and again in June ofthis year without that process of consultation having been fully carriedthrough, and without the Corporations&apos; acceptance of the External FinancingLimits set having been secured in all cases.     While the Chairmen&apos;s Groupappreciates that special factors were at work in the case of the Junerevisions, it urges strongly that the Code of Practice should be drawn insuch a way as to ensure full consultation, and as far as possible fullagreement, on all future occasions.&apos; The Government should keep closely in mind the wide-ranging and disruptiveeffects which revisions of the External Financing Limits can have on thewhole of the Corporations&apos; business planning.     They may well, for example,force sudden changes in investment plans which can seriously disturb thewell-being of the private sector capital goods industries; and they cannave altogether-deleterious effects on the carefully planned course ofdiscussions with the Unions.THJLjASgS OF ASSESSMENTS^hen drawing up their business plans in the past, the Corporations have hadthe ^benefit of some guidance from the Government on economic issues; ameasure of stability has existed on the capital expenditure side by reasonQf the procedure for prior Ministerial authorisations, ranging three yearsahead; and the existence of publicly-stated Counter-Inflation Policies
- 16 -has provided guidance on wages issues in most recent years. Nevertheless,it has always been accepted that it is the responsibility of the Boards ofthe Corporations to decide on the assumptions underlying their businessplanning, making such use of Government guidance as they judge proper.2, The Chairmen&apos;s Group believes strongly that this arrangement shouldcontinue, both on practical grounds and grounds of principle.     The Code ofPractice should therefore lay down that it is the responsibility of eachCorporation to determine what assumptions should be included in itsbusiness plan, except where the Government explicitly intervenes to laydown guidance on any particular issue, as Ministers have just done, ineffect, in relation to the allowance to be included for pay increases.3, It is important that at the end of the process, ie, when external financinglimits are eventually set for the Corporations, it should be clear to allconcerned what assumptions underlie the figures and who bearsresponsibility for them.     Accordingly, at the time when the externalfinancing limits are published, there should be an exchange of lettersbetween the Departments and the Corporations covering these matters.4, The Code of Practice should make provision to cover the situation whereassumptions for which responsibility rests wholly or substantially withMinisters are found to be appreciably wrong as the year proceeds, and thedivergence endangers any Corporation&apos;s ability to live within its externalfinancing limit.     In this event, the Corporation concerned should beentitled to ask the Government to take one or other of two courses. Thefirst would be for the Government to adjust its external financing limit byan appropriate amount, in line with the well-established practice appliedto Departmental cash limits when policy or other changes arise, (eg,Cmnd.7681, Table 1, records 68 such adjustments in 1978/79).     The secondwould be for the Government to accept any industrial or commercial stepssuggested by the Corporation which would enable it to remain within itsoriginal external financing limit, including additional price changes.The main difficulty which could arise under this procedure concerns thetreatment of pay increases^; and here, NICG would welcome an opportunityfor discussion.JDS-TABLEThe Chairmen&apos;s Group appreciates that the Government&apos;s timetable forsettling the Corporations&apos; External Financing Limits is determined bywider considerations, and particularly by the timing of the Budget.Nevertheless, the Corporations are naturally concerned to ensure that theExternal Financing Limits within which they will have to operate, and whichwill appreciably affect the conduct of their businesses, should be based oninformation which is as up-to-date and as well-based as possible.r,A distinction needs to be drawn between the situation where a Corporationand its Unions negotiate a wage settlement in excess of the Government&apos;sguideline while that guideline is still capable of exerting influence ongeneral level of wage settlements, and the situation where a Corporationcomes to the point of settlement after the general course of wagebargaining has clearly overturned the Government&apos;s initial payaspirations, as occurred after the collapse of the last Government&apos;s 5%Pay norm early in 1979.    Ministerial comment has so far focussed entirelyon &apos;the former case.     However, the latter case warrants considerationalso, since most Corporations settle late in the annual pay round.
- 17 -5 The Chairmen&apos;s Group does not wish to propose any specific alternativetime-table, since this is a matter needing detailed discussion in the lightof Whitehall&apos;s own requirements and the many variations in practice betweenthe Corporations, the most important of which is the differences in year-end dates.     Nevertheless, the timing of the business planning exerciseswhich produce the Corporations&apos; estimates of their external financingrequirements must clearly be a significant factor.7, Like many large private sector companies, most Corporations begin theirbusiness planning by assessing broad economic prospects in the last Springor early Summer, following the Budget; and their plans are then built upthrough the various stages of sales forecasting, production and capitalplanning, financial assessments, and subsequent revisions, until theforecasts for the year ahead finally emerge a reasonably short periodbefore their new financial years begin.    Thus, the information which mostCorporations submit for the PESC exercise in the Autumn is necessarilyprovisional, and cannot be regarded as providing an adequate basis fordefining levels of external financing within which the Corporation can beexpected to commit themselves to operate their businesses.     Indeed, forCorporations with April-March financial years, only the final businessplans produced in the early Spring can be regarded as authoritative forthis purpose.     However, if Government timing so dictates, the dataprovided to Departments for the purposes of the annual investment andfinancing review in February could be taken as a tolerable basis forconstructing a new time-table for dealing with the Corporation&apos;s externalfinancing limits.8. The Chairmen&apos;s Group has long regarded this timing issue as a seriousproblem, to which there is no easy answer, and has looked forward todiscussing possible ways of ameliorating the difficulties to which it hasgiven rise.     However, the Government&apos;s decision to expedite the PESCexercise this year, and to seek to publish the Corporations&apos; externalfinancing limits by November, has made the matter one of urgency.15. One suggestion which warrants consideration in this connection is thatthe first set of figures published by the Government on the nationalisedindustries&apos; financing requirements, which are normally based on the verytentative submissions which the Corporations make in the Autumn, should beshown in total only.     The final figures for individual Corporations couldthen be worked out nearer to Budget-time, on the basis of the Corporations&apos;February submissions.     While these final discussions would necessarilyhave to have regard to the overall sum initially published, a reasonabledegree of flexibility would remain, because of the considerable allowancefor &quot;shortfall&quot;: eg., for 1979/80, this allowance amounts to  500 million,as against a figure of  2,328 million for the sum of the individualCorporations&apos; Cash Limits.THE &quot;PRICE BASIS&quot; OF THE FIGURES* Hitherto, as between the initial appearance of figures for theCorporations&apos; External Financing Limits in the Public Expenditure WhitePaper and the final announcement in the Financial Statement and BudgetReview, the way in which the Limits are expressed has been changed. Theformer document has shown them in terms of &quot;survey prices&quot; for thethen-current year, whereas the latter document has shown them In terms ofestimated out-turn prices&quot; for the year ahead.     It is assumed that thesame will apply this year, despite other changes in the arrangements.
- 18 -The Corporations find this change of horses in mid-stream irritating andconfusing.     What is much more important, however, is that the processinvolves introducing into the exercise a Government assumption about thelikely rate of inflation, the scale of which is not stated in the FinancialStatement and Budget Report, but which is very likely to lie below theCorporations1 own planning assumptions, (see paras A11-A14).     And if thatGovernment inflation allowance does indeed prove to have been set too low,the Corporations1 external financing limits will suffer a further elementof &quot;hidden erosion&quot;, on top of any cuts which may have been made openly byMinisters when setting the limits in volume terms.     This has certainlybeen the case this year; and though the extent of the &quot;hidden erosion&quot; nowoccurring cannot be quantified by NICG, it is believed to be veryconsiderable indeed., The Code of Practice should provide for the review arrangements referred toin paragraph A14 to cover this aspect also.     In other words, if eventsshow that the Government1s original inflation assumption has been setappreciably too low in any year, Corporations should be entitled to askthat their external financing limits should be re-expressed on amorerealistic basis in money terms, while naturally remaining unchanged involume terms.carry-over. The Financial Targets set for the Corporations call on them to take amedium-term view of the course of their business, and so envisage someflexibility as between one year and another.     The Cash Limits regime,however, based on a single-year approach, may cut across that flexibilityin an undesirable and unhelpful way.     This is especially so in relation toinvestment spending, where all experience shows that the setting of &quot;toplimit&quot; figures with no provision for carry-overs creates a climate ofopinion which positively encourages spending.    The review of practice vis-a-vis Ministerial investment authorisations, conducted under Treasurychairmanship in 1975, expressly recognised this point, and the arrangementswere changed accordingly to set such authorisations on a &quot;mid-point&quot;basis.The Chairmen&apos;s Group hopes that consideration will be given to regardingthe External Financing Limits set for public sector industries as mid-pointfigures rather than maximum figures.     This may obviously pose theoreticalproblems in terms of the Governments annual financing arrangements. Inpractice, however, any net over-run is likely to be small in relation tothe aggregates involved, and well within the unavoidable margins of error;and the offsetting advantages from the industries&apos; viewpoint could beconsiderable.MONITORINGThe existing arrangements for the monitoring of the Corporations&apos;activities in relation to their External Financing Limits, which includeProvision for either monthly or quarterly reports and discussions, areJudged satisfactory.     Care must, however, be taken to recognise thesPecial situations affecting particular Corporations: eg, the National BusCompany has, as a component part of its External Financing Limit, the newus grant, for which the legislation expires next year.
