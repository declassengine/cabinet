RESTRICTEDCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 40 COPY NQ1 October 1979CABINETDISPERSAL OF CIVIL SERVICE POSTS:THE REVISED PROGRAMME FOR MERSEYSIDEMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilINTRODUCTION1.        Under the revised dispersal programme agreed by Cabinet on26 July 1979 (CC(79) 12th Conclusions, Minute 4) and announced inParliament the same day, a substantial number of posts is due to be movedfrom London to Bootle.    It has already been agreed that 150 of the postsare to be from the Home Office Computer Centre and 100 from theProperty Services Agency (PSA).    Cabinet asked me to report back withfirm proposals on the rest of the package,ACCOMMODATION2. There is a large new open-plan building - St John&apos;s House - inBootle.    There are also other offices nearby at present occupied byInland Revenue who would welcome bringing as many of their Merseysidestaff as possible together under one roof in St John&apos;s House.    We couldthen fulfil our commitment to Bootle by dispersing Lonuon staff into someof the smaller, conventional buildings vacated by Revenue.    The leasesof the rest would be given up.    This would be the most efficient arrangement.OPTIONS3. There are, as I see it, only two choices in meeting our commitmentto Bootle.    Both of them confine the search to posts in the Departmentsdestined for Merseyside in the previous programme.4. Option 1 involves taking most of the posts from one Department,the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), who would move 1, 200 posts toBootle, leaving less than 300 of their headquarters staff in a small Londonoffice.    To these 1, 200 we can add 100 staff from PSA and 300 Home Officecomputer staff for whom the computer suite in St John&apos;s House is alreadybeing specially adapted.    Only the Home Office staff would join the InlandRevenue in St John&apos;s House;  the PSA and HSE staff who do not want open-Plan accommodation would occupy other buildings.  Altogether this amountsto 1, 600 new posts to Bootle which I believe can be claimed as fulfilling0w commitment.    On the other hand the Secretary of State for Employmentis sure that the move to Bootle would meet with strong objections from theHSE.1RESTRICTED
RESTRICTED5. Option 2 draws on a larger number of Departments but with fewerposts from each, on the following line si-He alth. and Safety ExecutiveMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodHome OfficeForeign and Commonwealth OfficeProperty Services Agency5505503002501001, 750But the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, as a policyorientated Department needing close links with Whitehall and Brussels,would apparently find it difficult to be split in this way, and there areobvious drawbacks in sending Diplomatic Service staff to Bootle betweenoverseas postings.CONCLUSION6.        The best solution is to take most of the posts needed for Bootlefrom a single Department and I therefore recommend Option 1 as theleast inconvenient for Government.Civil Service Department1 October 1979RESTRICTED
