THIS &quot;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTOP SECRET. Copy No. JIt is requested that special care be takento ensure the  secrecy of  this documentPALESTINE.STATEMENT OF POLICY.1. The British and United States Delegations have now examined as awhole the recommendations of the Anglo-American Committee of Enquiry andhave arrived at a common viewpoint on the broad principles of a policy forcarrying out these recommendations. The following summary of these general principles is submitted for consideration by the two Governments.Displaced Persons and the Position of European Jews.2. There are two aspects to this problem (i) re-settlement in Europe, and(ii) emigration to countries outside Europe.The Anglo-American Committee recognised that the overwhelming majorityof displaced persons, including a considerable number of Jews, will continueto live in Europe. One of our objectives should, therefore, be to create conditionsfavourable to the re-settlement of a substantial number of displaced personsin Europe.3. The only areas in Europe in which our two Governments can directlycontrol these conditions are the British and United States Zones of Germany and.Austria, In these areas, they are prepared to assist native Jews to resettle once more in German and Austrian communities. All available means are being usedto eradicate anti-semitism. Concentration camp survivors receive special treat5-ment as to rations, financial assistance, housing and employment. Moreover, bothAmerican and British authorities are pressing for an early decision on plans,at present under quadripartite examination, for the restitution of propertyconfiscated by the Nazis. We recommend that all further practicable steps shouldbe taken to make possible the resettlement of displaced persons in those zones.4. Italy and the four ex-enemy satellite States will be required by the peace treaties to secure to all persons under their jurisdiction human rights and thefundamental freedoms, and it may be hoped that this will promote in thesecountries conditions favourable to the resettlement of displaced persons.5. Elsewhere in Europe our two Governments must rely on action throughthe United Nations to give practical effect to the provisions on human rights inthe Charter. They should support the establishment of a Commission for human rights, and also such measures of implementation as the United Nations mayadopt to ensure the protection of these rights, to the fullest extent practicable.Through their support of the efforts of the United Nations to re-establishpolitical and economic stability in Europe, our Governments will continue tocontribute to the restoration of those basic conditions which will make possiblethe reintegration in Europe of a substantial number of displaced persons,including Jews.6. Though substantial numbers of displaced persons may be resettled inEurope, new homes must be found elsewhere for many of those, including Jews,whose ties with their former communities have been irreparably broken. As theAnglo-American Committee pointed out, Palestine alone cannot provide forthe emigration needs of all Jewish victims of Nazi and Fascist persecution. Thetwo Governments should therefore proceed at once with measures designed to aid the resettlement elsewhere of other Jews and displaced persons. These will include the following : (a) Continuing support, through the United Nations, for the establishmentof the International Refugee Organization which will be capable ofdealing effectively with the problem of refugees and displaced persons as a whole.
2(b) Strong support for the appeal to be made at the forthcoming general assembly of the United Nations calling on all member governments to receive in territories under their control a proportion of thedisplaced persons in Europe, including Jews. In doing so, it shouldbe emphasised that the United Kingdom Government has already accepted a commitment to promote the resettlement of about 235,000Polish troops and civilians and their dependants. In addition, alarge proportion of the refugees admitted during the period of lNazipersecution have remained in the United Kingdom. Of these,approximately 70,000 are Jews. With respect to the United States,275,000 refugees have been permanently resettled there, including180,000 Jews. On resumption of the normal flow of immigration tothe United States some 53,000 quota and non-quota immigrants fromthose European countries from which the displaced persons are drawnwill be able to enter as permanent residents every year. It may beassumed that in the fiscal year ending the 30th June, 1947, the large majority of these immigrants will be Jews and other displaced persons.The President of the United States is prepared to seek the approval of congress for special legislation for the entry into the United Statesof 50,000 displaced persons, including Jews.(c) Simultaneous, though separate, approaches to the Governments of theBritish Dominions, who should be informed of the action taken and proposed, and should be invited to support the appeal to member governments of the United Nations and to receive a number of displaced persons in territories under their control. Both Govern-ments, in their approach, would emphasise the weight of the influence which could be exerted by the example of action by the Dominions,the United Kingdom and the United States, in inducing other united nations to correspondingly liberal action. The United KingdomGovernment would further stress the relations between the settle-ment of displaced persons and the problem of Jewish immigration into Palestine. The United States Government would indicate thatthe arrangements it could undertake for an emergency quota would be favourably influenced if assurances had been given that a number of displaced persons would be resettled in the British Commonwealth.(d) Continued active support to the Inter-Governmental Committee onRefugees and, through it, to the resettlement of as many refugees anddisplaced persons as practicable. Active consideration is already being given to a promising proposal for the transfer of displaced persons to Brazil. The number to be resettled there is estimated at200,000 or more. Similar proposals relating to other South american countries are also being explored.7. We recommend that, simultaneously with the announcement of the new policy for Palestine, our two Governments should make a statement on the lines indicated in paragraphs 2-6 above. Arab opposition to the admission of 100,000Jews to Palestine will be much stronger if this movement begins before any indication has been given that steps are being taken to promote the resettlement of Jews and other displaced persons in Europe and to secure that other countriesreceive a share of those for whose emigration provision must be made.Palestine.8. We accept the principles laid down in Recommendation 3 of the Reportof the Anglo-American Committee, that Palestine as a whole can be neither a jewish nor an Arab State, that neither of the two communities in Palestine shoulddominate the other, and that the form of government should be such as to safe-guard the interests in the Holy Land of the three great monotheistic religions.We recommend that any form of government adopted should be based on these principles. We also endorse the ultimate objective, set forth in the Report, ofsecuring self-government for the inhabitants.The various alternatives to proceeding with the implementation of therecommendations of the Anglo-American Committee have been considered. It is our view that some alteration in the present governmental situation in Palestinehas to be made and made speedily. To attempt to continue the present situation would involve the imposition of a policy by the exertion of military force and against the resistance of either or both of the two peoples of Palestine.
In the present situation in Palestine the imposition of a system of government by external authority could only be avoided either (a) by the termination of theMandate and withdrawal of British troops, which would lead to such internecinewarfare by the Jews and Arabs as to make such a course unthinkable, or (b) byagreement among the Jews and Arabs themselves, of which there seems to be no present prospect.Since some degree of compulsion will probably have to be employed it shouldbe employed in setting in motion a system of government based on Recommenda-tion 3. The degree of such compulsion may be minimised and perhaps evenacquiescence secured by wise and practical implementation of thatEecommendation.The crux of the governmental problem in Palestine is to find a con-stitutional system which, while observing the principles of Recommendation 3,will best make possible progress towards self-government. The Report puts forward no detailed suggestions for this purpose and our main task has therefore been to devise a method for its attainment.We have considered an Instrument of Government on unitary bi-nationallines based on parity between the two peoples in its legislative and executive functions, with provision for emergency action by the Administering authority in the event of absence of willingness on the part of the two peoples to parti-participate in the functioning of such a plan, or in the event of a deadlock in suchgovernmental machinery.In view, however, of the expressed reaction of the two peoples to the Reportof the Anglo-American Committee, we believe that the following plan is morepracticable and that effect could be given to it with less difficulty.9. Territorial Areas. The plan envisages the division of Palestine intofour areas : an Arab Province, a Jewish Province, a District of Jerusalem and a district of the Negev. The Jewish Province will include eastern Galilee, mostof the Plains of Lsdraelon and Jezreel, the Beisan area, Haifa, the Plain ofSharon (excluding the town of Jaffa) and a portion of the southern coastal plain.The Jerusalem District will include Jerusalem, Bethlehem and their immediateenvirons. The Negev District will consist of the uninhabited triangle of waste&apos;-land in the south of Palestine beyond the present limit of cultivation. The ArabProvince will include the remainder of Palestine.The population of these areas will be approximately as follows : The Provincial boundaries will be purely administrative boundaries, defining the area within which a local legislature is empowered to legislate on certainsubjects and a local executive to administer its laws. They will in no sense befrontiers and they will consequently have no significance as regards defence,customs or communications. In our view, however,. it is of great importance tomake it clear that, once settled, these boundaries will not be susceptible of changeexcept by agreement between the two Provinces. We recommend that a pro-vision to this effect be embodied in any Trusteeship agreement and in anyinstrument bringing the plan into operation. The details of the boundariesproposed are shown in the map reproduced in Appendix A.10. Division of Powers.-The Provincial Governments will have power oflegislation and administration within their provincial areas with regard tomunicipal and village administration, agriculture, fisheries, forests, land registra-tion, land sales, land settlement, land purchase and expropriation, education,public health and other social services, trade and industry, and local roads,irrigation, development and public works. They will also have power to limit thenumber and determine the qualifications of persons who may take up permanent residence in their territories after the date of the introduction of the plan. TheProvincial Governments will be required by the Instrument of Government whichestablishes the fundamental law to provide for the guarantee of civil rights andequality before the law for all residents. They shall not, in their legislation or administration, impose obstacles to free inter-territorial transit, trade orcommerce.Plan for Provincial Autonomy.Arab ProvinceJewish ProvinceJerusalem DistrictNegev DistrictA arabs.815,000301,00096,000/ eivs.15,000451,000102,000
For the.purpose of carrying out these functions the Provincial governments will have power to appropriate funds, to levy taxes, excluding customs and excise duties, to borrow within the Province, and, with the consent of the CentralGovernment, to borrow abroad.Control of foreign exchange and currency shall, for the time being, be a function of the Central Government. The Central Government shall also forthe time being be responsible for the licensing of imports. It shall allocatelicences equitably between the two Provinces after consultation with their repre-sentatives. Within two years of the introduction of the provincial autonomyplan (unless a later date is agreed to by the Provinces and the Central Govern-ment) a broad allocation of the value of import licences between the two Provincesshall be made from time to time by the Central Government, in consultation withthe Provinces. Thereafter the Provinces shall have the right to obtain for theirresidents licences up to the amount of the allocation and to decide to what classesof goods such licences shall be allocated. At a date not later than the31st December, 1946, import licensing shall be on a non-discriminatory basis asbetween sources of supply.If Palestine becomes a member of the United Nations or any specialised agencies thereof (including the International Monetary Fund, the international bank, or the proposed International Trade Organisation) the Provincial Govern-ments must deal with all relevant matters within their jurisdiction in a mannerconsistent with the obligations of Palestine as a member of these bodies.There will be reserved to the Central Government exclusive authority as to defence, foreign relations, customs and excise. In addition, there will be reservedinitially to the Central Government exclusive authority as to police, prisons,courts, railway facilities and Haifa harbour, posts and telegraphs, civil aviation,broadcasting and antiquities, though certain of these powers will be transferredin whole or in part to the Provincial Governments as soon as it becomes practic-able. The Central Government will, in addition, have power to borrow money,to make financial grants to the Provinces, to provide for inter-territorial and inter-national irrigation and development projects, to facilitate inter-territorial and international trade and commerce and communications and to provide for arterialhighways. It will be empowered to examine and verify municipal and provincialaccounts, to prescribe suitable and uniform methods of accounting, to prescribe the uses of any funds granted by it to the Provinces, and to examine proposedbudgets of provincial expenditures, and to make recommendations with respectto them.Immigration will be administered by the Central Government. So far as theProvinces are concerned, the Central Government will authorise the immigrationdesired by the respective Provincial Governments, to the extent to which theeconomic absorptive capacity of the Province will not thereby be exceeded. Itshall not have power to authorise immigration into either Province in excess ofany limitations imposed by the Provincial Government.All powers not expressly granted to the Provincial Governments will be reserved to the Central Government.11. Provincial Governments. An elected Legislative Chamber will be estab-lished in each Province. During the first five years of the plan the presidingofficers of those Chambers will be appointed by the High Commissioner. There-after they will be elected by the Chambers from among their members. Billspassed by these Legislative Chambers will become law only after they have receivedthe assent of the High Commissioner, representing the Administering Authority,but assent will be denied only if such Bills are inconsistent with the Instrument ofGovernment.A provincial legislature may provide that any residents of the JerusalemDistrict designated by it may be represented in the provincial legislature if they so desire.An Executive consisting of a Chief Minister and a Council of Ministers willbe appointed in each Province by the High Commissioner from among the membersof the Legislative Chamber, after consultation with its leaders.If a Provincial Government fails to perform a proper governmental functionor exceeds its proper function, the High Commissioner will have authority toexercise emergency powers within the Province for the performance of thatfunction or to prevent such excess.12. The Central Government. The executive and legislative functions ofthe Central Government will initially be exercised by a High Commissionerappointed by the Administering Authority.  He will be assisted by a nominated
Executive Council composed of the heads of the major executive departments.Certain of these departments will be headed, as soon as the High Commissionerdeems practicable, by Palestinians.A Development Planning Board will be established by the High Commissionercomprising the heads of the appropriate central executive departments and repre-sentatiyes of each of the Provinces. This Board will initiate plans for the general economic development of Palestine and will supervise the implementation ofsuch plans. A Tariff Board will also be established on similar lines to advise oncustoms and excise policy and on the rates of duty to be imposed.13. The Jerusalem District. In the Jerusalem District there will beestablished a council with powers similar to those of a municipal council. Themajority of its members will be elected, but there will be certain members designated-nated by the High Commissioner.The Central^ Government in respect of the Jerusalem District will have thesame powers to limit the number and determine the qualifications of persons who may take up permanent residence in that District as are conferred on provincial governments in respect of their Provinces.Powers not&apos; delegated to the District Council will be exercised in the jerusalem District by the Central Government.14. The Negev District. The Negev District will be held under directadministration by the Central Government pending a survey of its developmentpossibilities. Within five years and upon the completion of this survey, the administering Authority shall submit to the appropriate organ of the united nations recommendations, arrived at after consultation with the Arab and JewishProvinces, concerning the disposition of the area.15. Considerations in the Adoption of the Provincial Plan. The following are the main advantages of the plan for provincial autonomy: The plan offers to the Jews an opportunity to exercise a wide measure ofcontrol over immigration into one part of Palestine and to forward in theJewush Province the development of the Jewish National Home. At the sametime it offers to the majority of the Arabs of Palestine their own political institu-tions in an Arab Province and freedom from the fear of further jewish immigration into that Province without their consent. It makes it possible togive practical effect to the principles of government enunciated in Recommenda-tion 3 of the Anglo-American Committee; and it offers a prospect of developmenttowards self-government of which there is less hope in a unitary Palestine. it provides a means&quot; of segregating Jew and Arab to an extent which shouldsubstantially reduce the risk of a continuation of widespread violence and disorder in Palestine.In the long term, the plan leaves the way open for constitutional develop-ment either towards partition or towards federal unity. The association ofrepresentatives of the two Provinces in the administration of central subjectsmay lead ultimately to a fully developed federal constitution. On the contrary,if the centrifugal forces prove too strong, the way is open towards partition.The provincial plan does not prejudge this issue either way. The administering authority will be prepared to hand over the government to the people of thecountry as soon as the two communities express a common desire to that end and present an agreed scheme which will ensure its stable administration.In arriving at the provincial autonomy plan, as preferable on grounds ofpracticability to the unitary bi-national plan, we are not unmindful of thefact that there are inherent in it certain difficulties : (a) The plan calls for immediate decision on the highly controversial matterof the boundaries of the respective provinces. It is one on which feelings on bothsides are apt to run high.(b) The Jewish and Arab populations are so interlaced in the area out ofwhich a Jewish Province would have to be created that a very serious minorityproblem would arise in that province which would not be involved in theproposed Arab Province. The argument may be made by the Arabs that if itis proper to submit such a large segment of the Arab population to a majority rule by the Jews in the Jewish Province those same considerations would support their own contention that a Palestinian State be set up in which there wouldbe a majority of the Arabs and a minority of the Jews. Under the proposedsystem, however, there would be effective protection for the Arab minority inthe Jewish Province.
(c) The proposed boundaries are such that the land and other economic resources in the Jewish area are superior to those in the Arab area. TheJewish area would be well able to support the requisite governmental services ofthe Provincial Government. The Arab area would not now be able to supporteven the present level of services, much less the improved services which the recom-mendations of the Anglo-American Report urge as necessary to raise the Arabstandard of living. This difficulty is met by the general power given to theCentral Government to make grants to provinces and by the specific provisions in a later paragraph for meeting the anticipated deficiencies in the budget ofthe Arab Province during the earlier years of the autonomy plan.After considering the foregoing difficulties, we feel that the provincial autonomy plan is the preferable one for meeting Recommendation 3.15a. Further Details of Provincial Autonomy Plan. The United states delegation have submitted a preliminary draft for the heads of an instrument of government to give effect to this Plan. This draft, which is reproduced inAppendix B, gives some further details of the constitution proposed. The drafthas not been examined by the two Delegations jointly; but it is a valuable contribution which will serve as a basis for further work on the preparation ofthe draft constitution.Holy Places.16. It will be the duty of the Central Government to safeguard the Moslem,Jewish, and Christian Holy Places. An inter-denominational Council will beset up to advise the Central Government on all matters relating to the ChristianHoly Places.Land Policy.17. In putting the provincial autonomy plan into effect the administering authority will rescind the Land Transfers Regulations of 1940. The prohibitionor frustration of provisions in leases stipulating that only members of one race,community or creed may be employed on or in connection with the land leasedwill be a matter for action by the provincial authorities.Immigration.18. Under the provincial autonomy plan immigration will be administered by the Central Government separately for the Arab Province, the Jewish Province,and the Jerusalem and Negev Districts. In effect, immigration into the Provinceswill be regulated by the provincial Governments, subject only to the power ofthe Central Government, which may impose limitations upon immigration inaccordance with the economic absorptive capacity of either Province. these provisions will probably mean the complete exclusion of Jewish immigrants fromthe Arab Province, but will result, under ordinary circumstances, in immigration into the Jewish Province on whatever scale is desired by its Government. Thegrounds on which the Central Government could curtail the immigration quotasproposed by the Provinces will be defined in the Instrument of Government andin any trusteeship agreement or other instrument approved by the united nations. The provincial authorities will, therefore, be able to appeal to theUnited Nations against any decision in respect of immigration which theyconsider to be in contravention, of the terms of such instruments.On the assumption that our proposals for provincial autonomy are adopted asthe policy of our two Governments, we recommend the acceptance of Recommenda-tions 2 and 6 of the Anglo-American Committee.\19. We have considered the memorandum embodying the results of thepreliminary discussions held in London from the 17th to 27th June on Recom-mendation 2 of the Anglo-American Report, and we endorse the Outline plan for the movement of 100,000 Jews to Palestine.A summary of this Plan, revised to take account of our conclusions on thequestions of policy then left outstanding and to incorporate certain later informa-tion, is contained in Appendix C.We recommend that this plan be initiated immediately it is decided to put the constitutional proposals into effect.We recommend that every effort should be made to complete the operationwithin twelve months of the date on which the emigration begins. We recom-mend that the necessary immigration certificates should be issued as rapidly as.
possible. As regards the rate of movement, shipment will proceed at &quot;themaximum rate consistent with the clearance of the transit camps in Palestine.For the purpose of checking illegal immigration, any Jews entering Palestineillegally after the plan has been initiated will be counted against the 100,000.The Arab Programme.20. We accept Recommendations 5 and 9 of the Anglo-American Committeethat the economic and educational standards of the Arabs should be raised, subjectto the proviso that the pace at which such development can be undertaken willhave to be limited by practical considerations such as the provision of trained personnel and the capacity of the economy of the area to absorb a large spendingprogramme. A tentative plan has been worked out by the Palestine Governmentwhich can form the basis of the programme.(a) Health and Social Services. We endorse the proposals for a health service for the Arabs of a standard similar to that established for the Jews.We also cpntemplate the establishment of social services ancillary to education and health, e.g., institutions for the care of mothers, children and the old, schoolfeeding, playgrounds, unemployment assistance, the teaching of handicrafts, youthand cultural organisations.(b) Education. The immediate provision of compulsory education for theArabs is not practicable, but universal primary education could be achieved in tenyears except as regards girls in the smaller villages. Immediate steps should betaken to improve primary, secondary and university education in the Arab com-munity.(c) Economic Measures. Improved facilities for education and for health and other social services will not alone bridge the gap between the standards ofliving of the two communities; a wide economic advancement must accompanythem.The greatest part of the Arab rural community, which constitutes 66 per cent,of the whole Arab population, consists of a peasantry living at about bare sub-sistence level. There are few village industries and Arab industry in generalprovides very little employment. Measures to improve Arab economic conditions must be directed primarily to the agricultural population, but should also includemeasures to promote the development of light industries. The principal measuresenvisaged are the following : (i) Agrarian reorganisation to rationalise and consolidate land holdings.(ii) Improvement in the use of land :  promotion of regional development:prevention of erosion : agricultural research.(iii) Promotion of light industries and development of local crafts and industries.(iv) Provision of cheap credit.(v) Expansion of labour organisations,(vi) Promotion of the co-operative movement.(d) Living Conditions. We also recommend the following measures for improving living conditions in the Arab community : &apos;(i) Improvements in housing and promotion of housing schemes.(ii) Survey and town planning with a view to improvement schemes,(iii) Improvement of water supplies.21.   The cost of the foregoing proposals is discussed in later paragraphs.Development Projects.22. We believe that the need for economic development in Palestine shouldbe recognised as merely a part of a broader situation with respect to economic development in the countries of the Middle East. In any statement which is madeto the interested parties or to the public, it should be emphasised that our Govern-ments have assisted and welcomed the advent of the States of the Middle Eastinto full political equality. They have observed with interest the examination by those States of their possibilities for economic development, which appear tobe great. If it is the desire of any of those States to resort to international agencies for aid by loan or otherwise in exploring and effectuating such projects,,as for &quot;example in the reclaiming or improvement of great areas by water controland irrigation, they will receive sympathetic support.
Certainly most substantial Palestinian development should be linked with developments in Trans-Jordan and probably in Syria and the Lebanon.We recommend that a survey of the water resources of Palestine and, withthe consent of the Government of Trans-Jordan, of water resources common tothe two areas should be undertaken as soon as possible by consulting engineersof international repute. They should further be invited, if adequate data forthe purpose is available, to draw up an outline project indicating the best useof the water available. This project should be considered, and action on it taken,by the Central Government in consultation with the Development Board, to which for this purpose the Government of Trans-Jordan and of any other neighbouringState affected would be invited to send representatives.23. Long-term development schemes which are wholly within one Provincewill be financed by borrowing internally or abroad by the Provincial Govern-ment or an appropriate organisation in the Province. In the event that the borrowing is from abroad it is possible that the loans will have to be guaranteed by the Central Government. Long-term development schemes which involve bothProvinces or perhaps neighbouring countries will require participation by theCentral Government but it will be desirable for the Provincial Governments totake as much responsibility as is practicable in day-to-day administration andparticularly in finance. The financial support of such projects should ultimately be made the responsibility of the Provinces in proportion to the benefits whichthey derive. Schemes financed by loans should be self-liquidating and as suchthey oan be secured on revenues from the projects reinforced when necessary by a general charge on provincial revenues.Finance.24. We have considered various estimates of the cost of carrying out themeasures set out above. We have also considered the effect on the Palestinebudget of introducing the proposed scheme of provincial autonomy. We havebased our conclusions on two assumptions; first, that the cost-of-living indexwill not rise in Palestine, and, secondly, that there will be no increased expendi-ture on law and order coupled with loss of revenue due to disorders and non-co-operation.On the first of the points, it is clear that the programmes envisaged willconstitute an inflationary influence, but against this a large part of expenditureswill be for imported goods financed with external money. In addition,substantial borrowing of savings Avithin Palestine may be assumed and increasing supplies of imported goods at lower prices should become available.Should our assumption be incorrect, it is not possible to estimate the effect onthe Palestine budget, but cost-of-living subsidies involving expenditure of up to  4 million might be necessary. Equally, disorders and non-co-operationmight add significantly to expenditures and reduce revenues.25. The Jewish Programme. According to our studies the total costs ofthe immigration of the 100,000 Jews can be put at approximately  70 million,made up as follows :  ,  &apos; Transitional assistance   ...      ...      ...       ...        6,000,000Housing     ..................      14,000,000Capital investment to provide employment     ...      50,000,000Since it is essential to complete the programme as soon as possible, we assume that the whole  70 million will be spent within two years. The maximumexpectation from reparations available for Palestine is  5 million; from con-tribution by world Jewry  20 million; and from loans to be raised in Palestine,whether in Palestine pounds or in sterling,  35 million. This would give a totalof  60 million for the Jewish programme, leaving a deficit of  10 million, whichcan be met by self-liquidating loans.26. The Jewish Agency has publicly accepted responsibility for costsconnected with the immigration of 100,000 Jews to Palestine. This financial responsibility should be confirmed, but there would be no need to ask the agency to agree to any of our specific estimates. In due course the responsibility inquestion will be transferred to the Government of the Jewish Province.Our studies indicate that  10 million of required capital cannot beprovided from Jewish sources within the next two years. As, however, this deficiency is for purposes suitable for self-liquidating loans, it can be met byloans under the $250 million credit provided for in paragraph 29.
27. Financial Effects of Provincial Autonomy. A rough distribution ofexisting expenditures and revenues on the basis of the division of responsibilityamong the Central Government, the two Provinces and the Jerusalem Districtindicates that (a) The Central Government will continue to incur more than half of thepresent expenditures of the Palestine Government. It will have an estimated surplus .of the order of perhaps  1 million.(b) Revenues of the Jewish Province will be substantially in excess ofexpenditures, giving rise to a surplus of  1,400,000.(c) Expenditures of the Arab Province, will be substantially in excess ofrevenues, giving rise to a deficit of  2,100,000.Since expenditures in the programme for the benefit of the Arabs would be concentrated entirely in the Arab Province, the deficit of  2,100,000 in that province will be increased by an amount which might run to  1 million annuallyas an average in the first five years.From this total recurrent deficit of roundly  3 million there may be deducted possibly as much as  1 million representing excess revenues of theCentral Government subject to grants to the Province. There will remaincurrently a net deficit in the neighbourhood of  2 million. The United kingdom delegation proposes to recommend His Majesty&apos;s Government to ask Parliamentto&apos; assume ultimate responsibility for recurring deficits up to the time whenincreased revenues permit it to be met out of Arab Provincial or Central Govern-ment funds.28. Cost of the Arab programme. We have attempted to estimate the costof a practicable programme, using as a guide the estimate of costs made in a survey by the Palestine Government. That survey was made on the basis of a programme spread over the whole of Palestine. The concentration of the pro-gramme in the Arab area would, in any case, make it necessary to revise these estimates. We have allowed for this, and also for such limitations as theprovision of trained personnel and the capacity of the Arab economy to absorba large spending programme. Allowing for such considerations we think thata spending programme of up to  15 million to  20 million over 10 years shouldbe regarded as fully adequate to implement the recommendations for improvededucation, health, and economic services of the Anglo-American Committee. Inaddition  10 million should be provided for credit facilities.There are, however, so many unknown factors in the carrying out of sucha programme that it would be most unwise to commit ourselves to any public statement as to the amount of the programmes to be undertaken. Of the Arabprogramme  10 million for credit facilities could be secured from local bankcredits. Of the remainder of the programme, only a small portion would be suitable for the self-liquidating loans dealt with under paragraph 29. Provisionof an additional  12,500,000 at this time will, it is believed, care for expendituresufficient to ensure that the programme will be effectively carried forward tothe period when means of additional financing may be found. The UnitedStates Delegation has therefore agreed, as a part of its contribution to the general programme, to propose to the President of the United States that he recommendlegislation granting f 50 million to the Government of Palestine for the purposeof financing development schemes not suitable for self-liquidating loans and for assisting in the meeting of extraordinary expenses during the difficulties of the transitional period.29. Capital for Development. A large portion of the capital needed forthe self-sustaining projects mentioned in paragraph 22 must come from outsidesources. It is possible that Palestine could obtain a loan from the international bank if she should become a member. The United States Delegation proposes,in the event that adequate finance from other sources such as the international bank is not available, to recommend that the President seek legislation authorising the making of loans through an appropriate agency for the develop-ment of the Middle-East region, including Palestine, up to $250 million.29a. Details of the financial implications of our proposals are containedin Appendix D.30. Public Order. It is clear that the difficulties of introducing thepolicy which we have outlined will be greatly enhanced so long as there are inexistence armed organisations, Arab and Jewish, determined in the last resort
to oppose by force any solution which is not to their liking. We agree that private armies constitute a danger to the peace of the world and ougnt not to exist, and that attempts to prevent by violence the execution of the policy once it has been put - into effect should be resolutely suppressed. We agree that tothis end it is necessary that armed organisations which are not prepared tosubmit themselves to the full control of the Central Government should bedissolved and that the illegal holding of arms and explosives should bevigorously combated.31. Future Procedure. We recognise that, in view of the existing situation in Palestine, any policy for that country will probably have to beintroduced without the willing consent of either community. On the otherhand, there is a degree of sustained and determined resistance of either Jews orArabs beyond which no policy could be enforced. An effort to obtain at least a measure of acquiescence from the Arabs and Jews would, therefore, be anessential preliminary to the introduction of the above proposals. We therefore recommend that, if these proposals are adopted by our twro Governments, theyshould be presented to Arab and Jewish representatives as a basis for negotia-tions at a conference to be convened by the United Kingdom Government.32. In accordance with Recommendation 4 of the Anglo-American Com-mittee, we propose that the new policy should be embodied in a trusteeship agreement for Palestine. The conference with Arab and Jewish representatives should therefore be convened in time for its results to be available before theopening of the second part of the first session of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations. If the results of the conference were such as to suggest thatthe new policy would meet with a sufficient degree of acceptance in Palestine,the Government of the United Kingdom would proceed to put the plan intoeffect and wrould inform the General Assembly that practical considerationsrequired this to be done under the existing Mandate, but that they would presson as quickly as possible with a trusteeship agreement and would hope to lay a draft before the General Assembly at its next (1947) session. It would thenbe possible simultaneously to inaugurate the policy in Palestine and to under-take the consultations provided for in Article 79 of the United Nations Charter.33. We are not able at this stage to make recommendations regarding thecourse to be adopted if the conference with Arab and Jewish representativesled to the conclusion that the introduction of the policy proposed would be soviolently resisted by one or both of the two peoples in Palestine that it couldnot be enforced. &apos; In that situation further consultation between our twoGovernments would be necessary.London, 2Qth July, 1946.
APPENDIX B.Preliminary Draft of Heads of Instrument of Government.I. Preamble.Palestine shall be neither a Jewish State nor an Arab State.II. Territorial Areas.Palestine shall be divided into four territorial areas : 1. An autonomous Arab Province.2. An autonomous Jewish Province.3. A District of Jerusalem.4. A District of the Neeev.Matters of common concern to these four territorial areas shall be the concern of the Central Government of Palestine.III. Division o.f Governmental Powers.1. Upon the organization in a Province of the legislative and executivebodies provided for in Section IV the present Government of Palestine shalltransfer to the Provincial Government the administration in its provincial areaof the matters hereinafter committed to the Provincial Government.2. The Provincial Governments shall have power of legislation and adminis-tration with regard to municipal and village administration, agriculture, fisheries,forests, land registration, land sales, land settlement, land purchase and theacquisition of land for public purposes for fair compensation, education, publichealth and other social services, trade and industry within the provincial bordersand provincial roads, irrigation, development and public works. The provincial governments shall have power to fix the number and qualifications of any personssubsequently to become domiciled within their provincial borders. They shallin addition have power to levy taxes, excluding customs and excise duties, to borrow within the Province and, with the consent of the Central Government,to borrow abroad, and to appropriate and expend the funds so secured and anyother funds which may be received from the Central Government underSection III (6) for any of the matters hereinabove enumerated as to which theyare empowered to legislate and administer.3. Each of the Provincial Governments shall be under obligation to providefor and administer its general governmental services fairly and equally as between all of its residents, and to provide for them equal and suitable public health,social and educational services and shall not in its legislation or administrationimpose obstacles to free inter-provincial transit, trade and commerce, or thefree exercise of religion and civil rights within its borders.4. If Palestine becomes a member of the United Nations or any specializedagencies thereof (including the International Monetary Fund, the international bank, or the proposed International Trade Organization) the Provincial Govern-ments must deal with all relevant matters within their jurisdiction in a mannerconsistent with the obligations of Palestine as a member of these bodies.5. Existing statutes at present applicable in the provincial areas, so faras not inconsistent with the provisions of this instrument, shall remain in forcein those areas until repealed, or amended by the provincial legislature under thepowers hereinabove granted.6. There is- reserved to the Central Government exclusive legislative andadministrative power, during the initial period of the operation of this Instru-ment of Government, as to defence, foreign relations, customs and excise, police,prisons, courts, railway facilities and Haifa Harbour, posts and telegraphs, civilaviation, broadcasting and antiquities. The Central Government shall havepower to borrow money, to make financial grants to the provinces, to provide forinter-territorial and international irrigation and development projects, to facilitateinter-territorial and international trade and commerce and communications, toprovide for arterial highways, and to promote education and agriculture throughout
Palestine by a central information and supervisory service. It shall be empoweredalso to examine and verify municipal and provincial accounts, to prescribe suitableand uniform methods of accounting, to determine the bases upon which fundscollected by it in excess of its expenditures in the performance of its functionsmay be distributed to the Provinces, to prescribe to the Provinces the uses of suchfunds, and to examine proposed budgets of provincial expenditures and make recommendations with respect to them.7. Control of foreign exchange and currency shall, for the time being, bea function of the Central Government. The Central Government shall also forthe time being be responsible for the licensing of imports. It shall allocatelicences equitably between the two Provinces after consultation with their repre-sentatives.

At a date not later than the 31st December, 1946,import licensing shall be on a non-discriminatory basis as between sources ofsupply.8. Immigration shall be administered by the Central Government. So faras the Provinces are concerned, however, the Central Government shall authorisethe immigration desired by the respective Provincial Governments, to the extentto which the economic absorptive capacity of the Province will not thereby be exceeded. The Central Government shall not have power to authorize immigra-tion into either Province in excess of limitations imposed by the provincial governments under the powers hereinabove granted to them.9. All powers not expressly granted to the Provincial Governments shall be reserved to the Central Government.10. The High Commissioner shall, as soon as he deems it practicable,transfer in part or in full to the provincial authorities power over those matters,with the exception of foreign relations, defence, and customs and excise, whichare initially reserved to the exclusive authority of the Central Government underSection III (6).IV. Provincial Government.A. -Legislature.1. In each Province a legislative chamber shall be established which shallbe entitled to legislate on all matters declared by this Instrument to be theresponsibility of the Provincial Government.2.

The provincial legislative chambers shall have the power to determinequalifications for voters, boundaries of districts and the method of election.Until the provincial legislative chambers are established the present Governmentof Palestine shall lay down electoral rules in harmony wdth the above provisions.4. During the first five years of the operation of this Instrument thepresiding officer of e*ach legislative chamber shall be appointed by the HighCommissioner and shall as far as possible dissociate himself from the political implications of the functioning of the legislative chambers. Thereafter thepresiding officers shall be elected by the legislative chambers from among their members.5. Bills passed by a provincial legislature shall become effective law only after they have received the assent of the High Commissioner. This assent shallbe refused only when a bill is inconsistent with this Instrument of government or violates international obligations of the Administering Authority.6. A provincial legislature may provide that any residents of the JerusalemDistrict designated by it may be represented in the provincial legislative chamberif tfiey so desire. Voting qualifications, district boundaries and methods of election for this purpose by such residents shall be established by the CentralGovernment in conformity as far as possible with those of the respectiveProvinces.

APPENDIX C.The Move of 100,000 Jewish Immigrants into Palestine.1. Discussions were held in London from the 17th to the 27th June betweenofficial representatives, civil and military, of the British and United states government to review the main problems involved in the physical movement of100,000 Jews into Palestine and their settlement there and to prepare an outlineplan for the movement. The plan, revised in the light of later information and discussions, will be found in this Appendix, together with brief comments on certain aspects of the problem which are not covered either in the plan itself or inthe main Report.Method of Selection.2. The Anglo-American Committee estimated that at the time of theirReport there were in Germany, Austria and Italy some 98,000 Jews from othercountries. These then represented about 10 per cent, of the total number of displaced persons. Since then the numbers have increased. The latest returnsobtained from the control authorities in countries under Allied occupation aregiven in Annexes II and III.3. There is ample evidence that Jews have been moving into the western zones in the hope of securing onward passage to Palestine. If, therefore, 100,000Jews are to be sent to Palestine from Europe, it is most important that theyshould be selected in such a way as to make it clear to Jews in eastern Europethat they will not improve their chances of reaching Palestine by moving intothe occupied areas. It is, therefore, recommended that in the first instanceselection should be limited to Jewish displaced persons and persons assimilatedto displaced persons in status who are already in the western Zones of Germanyand Austria or in Italy. If it is found that the whole of the 100,000 cannot bedrawn from those countries, the balance of the 100,000 certificates should be allocated to other countries of eastern and south-eastern Europe, in proportionsto be determined in agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdomand United States, for the benefit of orphaned Jewish children in those countries.4. The method of selection proposed in the preceding paragraph should go far to check the infiltration into the western Zones of Jews who are anxious toemigrate to Palestine. There are, however, additional measures which shouldbe taken to check this infiltration. Thus, after the movement of the 100,000 hasbeen approved, the control authorities in the British and United States Zonesshould be authorised to refuse displaced persons care and treatment to all personsnot already registered who apply thereafter for such assistance. This would not preclude the grant of more limited assistance, at the discretion of either Govern-ment. Secondly, the control authorities should pursue, as the movement of the100,000 proceeds, a progressive policy of closing and dis-establishing the assemblycentres in which Jews have been segregated. The Jewish element in the displaced persons population would thus be concentrated, progressively, into a smaller number of camps. Thirdly, the Governments of the United Kingdom and UnitedStates should seek to enlist the assistance of organised Jewish agencies indiscouraging further infiltration of Jews into Germany, Austria and Italy.5. The priority groups suggested by the Anglo-American Committee intheir Report were taken as a framework and the details which were worked outare set forth in the plan.Certificate-issuing A genet/.6.

The certificates will be issued by the Jewish Agency in accordancewith a directive agreed between the United Kingdom and United States Govern-ments.  A draft of this directive is reproduced in Annex IV.
Transportation.7. (a) General Principles. The Government of the United States will assume responsibility for the movement from Germany, Austria and Italy to palestine, except that the necessary rations, plus three days reserve, rolling-stockand train guards for movements between a Zone not occupied by United states forces and a port of embarkation will be furnished by the originating Zone. Forthe movement to Palestine of immigrants, if any, to whom certificates might be allotted in other countries, the British Consul-General or the British member ofthe Allied Control Commission will, be responsible with the assistance andco-operation of the Allied military authorities, the Jewish Agency and otheragencies and Governments concerned.(b) Logistics. The United States Government will designate a co-ordinatorof the entire movement with Headquarters in the United States Zone of Germany.Movement will take place entirely through Italian ports or partly throughItalian ports and partly through a Channel port. Movement will commence in italy, in order to clear necessary staging areas. Converted Victory ships willbe provided hj the United States Government for the purpose, and the assistanceof organised relief agencies will be employed as appropriate throughout.Reception in Palestine.8. Consideration was given to the responsibilities to be assumed by thePalestine Government and the Jewish Agency respectively in the reception of the immigrants on their arrival in Palestine. The arrangements suggested for the reception of the immigrants are set out in the plan.Provision of materials and supplies.9. Full details are not yet available of the quantity of materials whichwill be involved in the construction of accommodation, both temporary and permanent, for the immigrants, but the bulk of these materials (other than a portion of the cement) will have to be imported from overseas. The main require-ments will be cement, mild steel bars, timber, pipes, pig iron, foundry coke, wirerods and copper sheet. From such enquiries as have been made to ascertain the extent to which these materials are available in the United Kingdom or inthe British and United States Zones in Germany for export to Palestine, it seems clear that a large part will have to be drawn from other sources. It will benecessary to be assured that they will be made available to the extent required;and any supplies obtained by the Jewish Agency for the purpose should beregarded as additional to PalestineV ordinary quota Jxi respect both of com-modities and of shipping. The United States and United Kingdom supply authorities should lend all appropriate assistance in this regard.10. The British and United States Governments should recognise the needfor increasing the Palestine quotas of imported food-stuffs to the extentnecessitated by the addition of 100,000 persons to the population and shouldassist in making available non-quota items.   The most important of these are :  Flour, in terms of wheat ...Flour, in terms of barley ...Edible oil, in terms of oilseedsMargarine, in terms of oilseedsMargarine, in terms of copraSugarTea......CoffeeBeefRicePer annumTons.6,3803,3601,8005803001.200239293630011. Contributions from various sources in the United States towards thecost of the immigration should be exempt from currency quota restrictions.
Outline Plan.1. Target.To issue as soon as possible 100,000 certificates for admission into Palestineof Jews who have been victims of Nazi and Fascist persecution, and to effecttheir actual immigration as rapidly as conditions will permit.2. Phasing.Every effort will be made to complete the operation within twelve months ofthe date on which emigration begins.3. Illegal Immigration.All immigrants entering Palestine illegally after the initiation of the plan will be counted against the 100,000, and a corresponding number of certificatesdeducted.4. Method of Selection.(a) Geographical A llocation of Certificates.(1) All certificates to be allocated initially for issue to Jewish displaced persons or Jews assimilated to displaced persons in status in the Western zones of Germany, Austria and in Italy. The overall allocation of certificates between italy and the several zones of occupation to be in proportion to the number ofeligible Jews in each on the 1st July, 1946.(2) Unused balance, if any, of certificates not required to permit all eligibleJews in Germany, Austria and Italy desiring to enter Palestine to do so to be allocated to other countries of eastern and south-eastern Europe for issue toorphaned Jewish children in proportions to be determined in agreement betweenthe Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States.(b) Priority Groups.(1) Among eligible Jews in Germany, Austria and Italy, priority in the issueof certificates and transfer to Palestine will, as far as possible without breaking up family groups and without delaying the rate of emigration, be given in thefollowing order : (i) Those resident in Italy and the Western Zones of Germany and austria and receiving care and assistance from the Allied Military authorities or from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administrationon the 1st October, 1945, with first priority to concentration campsurvivors.(ii) Those resident in the Western Zones of Germany and Austria and in italy on the 1st May, 1946, who had taken up residence and receivedthe assistance of the Allied Military Authorities or the united nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration subsequent to the1st October, 1945.(iii) Others.(2) Within each of the above groups priority will be given to the followingclasses : (i) Skilled workmen in the building and affiliated trades; agricultural workers.(ii) Children under 12 years of age. - -(iii) Persons permanently incapacitated for gainful employment. &apos; .(iv) Persons over 60 years of age.(3) The immediate families of the individuals in the classes set forth inparagraphs (1) and (2) will be accorded the same priorities as such individuals.(4) In other countries of eastern and south-eastern Europe any availablecertificates will be issued only to orphaned Jewish children below 17 years of age.(c) Issue of Certificates.(1) The Jewish agency for Palestine will issue certificates to eligible jews in accordance with the provisions of a directive (in the terms proposed in annex IV) to be issued by the Government of the United Kingdom.   1[32032] &apos; D
(2) In Allied occupied areas or countries, the Zone Commander or the Britishmember of the Allied Control Commission, respectively, will exercise general supervision and control over the issue of certificates by the Jewish Agency andits representatives.The United Kingdom Government will provide liaison officers to assist UnitedStates Zone Commanders in carrying out these duties and to be responsible for security screening of persons awarded or requesting certificates; it being under-stood that this screening process will be geared to the rate of movement.(3) The United Kingdom Government will be responsible for seeing that appropriate arrangements are made in the French Zones of Occupation, in poland and in other countries of eastern and south-eastern Europe.5. Transportation to Palestine.(a) Movement from Occupied Areas.(1) The overland portion of the movement will be accomplished by rail inbox cars (heated during winter months) or coaches if available. Railway rolling stock and train guards, which will carry through to destination, will be furnished by the Originating Zone. Each train will carry approximately 1,000 persons.Rations and 3 days&apos; reserve will be supplied. Feeding facilities will be established as determined by the respective Zone Commanders.(2) Supreme Allied Commander, Mediterranean Theatre, will be requestedto provide rail, port, and staging facilities in Italy as required, though the closing down of military installations in Italy by the due date shall not be delayed on account of the necessity of meeting the commitment. The ItalianGovernment through SACMED will be requested to provide facilities requiredin excess of those military facilities which can be made available.(3) Other factors may dictate the use of a Channel port for a portion of themovement, which might include as a maximum all Jews to be moved fromGermany and Austria.(4) Within total allotments to the respective areas, initial allotment of certificates will be made to Italy and initial movement will be from Italy to clearnecessary facilities in that area for use as staging centres.(b) Water Movement.(1) Necessary ocean shipping in the form of converted Victory ships, appro-appropriately staffed, will be provided by the United States.(2) Time factors and ship requirements are attached as Annex I.(c) General.(1) Administrative arrangements will be concluded between a Co-ordinatorof Movement, designated by the United States, and Supreme Allied CommanderMediterranean, CG USFET, CG USFA, Commander-in-Chief British Forces inGermany, Commander-in-Chief British Forces in Austria.(2) The assistance of organised relief agencies will be employed as appro-priate throughout.(d) Movement from Non-Occupied Areas.If certificates are issued to Jews in any country other than Germany, austria and Italy, the British Consul-General or the British Member of the Allied control commission will be responsible for the identification, documentation, collection,staging and transportation of such Jews. In carrying out the above respon-sibilities he will make the necessary arrangements with :  (1) the Governments concerned,(2) the United States military authorities whose assistance may be requiredto accomplish transportation to Palestine,(3) such Jewish Agency personnel as may be of assistance to him.6. Reception in Palestine.(a) Arrival.Clearance through the port will be the sole responsibility of the palestine government, the Jewish Agency being accorded the normal facilities to greet the immigrants and provide them with amenities.
(b) Staging Camp.The Jewish Agency will set up camps on approved sites for the reception ofthe immigrants. One of these camps might be designated as a staging camp atwhich all the control processes incidental to immigration will be carried out, the immigrants being then transferred to one or other of the remaining camps, heredescribed as &quot; residential camps &quot; or, alternatively, cleared immediately onevidence that appropriate accommodation is available.The control processes mentioned above will be carried out under the soleauthority of the Palestine Government. All other services in the staging camp,including welfare with the exception of supervision and security, will be theresponsibility of the Jewish Agency under the general supervision of the palestine government.(c) Transport.Transport between port and staging camp will be provided by the palestine government on application by the Jewish Agency, which will be responsible forthe relevant expenditure. Transport between the staging camp and the residentialcamps will be provided by the Jewish Agency.(d) Residential Camps.The Jewish Agency will be responsible for constructing and maintaining theresidential camps and for providing all services except general superintendenceand security. In particular, the Jewish Agency will be entrusted with theadministration of approved schemes of rehabilitation and technical training inor outside the camps.(e) Settlement and A bsorption.The construction of housing and ancillary buildings and works for the per-manent settlement of the immigrants will be the responsibility of the JewishAgencv.(Note.i The use of the term &quot; Jewish Agency &quot; above is not intended to preclude from association with the Jewish Agency in the maintenanceof the camps and the provision of services any organisation from whichthe Jewish Agency may, with the approval of the Palestine Government,obtain assistance to these ends.)[32032]

Annex IV.Rules Governing Issue of Immigration Certificates.  Draft of Directiveto Jewish Agency.&apos; A. Eligibility.1. One hundred thousand Jews who have been the victims of Nazi andFascist persecution or who may have been impelled by their circumstances to leavethe countries of their origin or who fled from persecution before the outbreak ofthe war are eligible for certificates.(a) In Italy and in United States, British and French Occupation Zones inGermany and Austria only those eligible Jews who were registered as D.Ps. or as persons assimilated to D.Ps. in status on or before........................ may be awarded certificates.(b) In countries other than Germany, Austria and Italy certificates may be awarded only to eligible Jews who are orphaned and below 17 yearsof age.2. No eligible Jew shall be denied a certificate because of his politicalbeliefs or utterances.3. Persons who are ineligible for admission to Palestine under the immigration laws now in force or who, as a result of military security screeningto be administered by the British authorities, are declared ineligible for admission to Palestine will not be awarded certificates.B. Allocation of Certificates.Allocation of certificates between the countries concerned will be made bythe Palestine Administration in accordance with methods agreed between theUnited Kingdom and United States Governments.C. Priority Groups.1. Among eligible Jews in Germany, Austria and Italy, priority in the issueof certificates and transfer to Palestine will, as far as possible without breaking up family groups and without delaying the rate of emigration, be given in thefollowing order :  (i) Those resident in Italy and the Western Zones of Germany and austria and receiving care and assistance from the Allied Military authorities or from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administrationon the 1st October, 1945, with first priority to concentration campsurvivors.(ii) Those resident in the Western Zones of Germany and Austria and in italy on the 1st May, 1946, who had taken up residence and receivedthe assistance of the United Nations Relief and rehabilitation administration or Military Authorities subsequent to the 1st October1945.(iii) Others.2. Within each of the above groups priority will be given to the followingclasses : (i) Skilled workmen in the building and affiliated trades; agricultural workers.(ii) Children under 12 years of age.(iii) Persons permanently incapacitated for gainful employment.(iv) Persons over 60 years of age.3. The immediate families of the individuals in the classes set forth inparagraphs 1 and 2 will be accorded the same priorities as such individuals.4. Balance of certificates unused in Austria, Germany and Italy, will be allotted to orphaned Jewish children in the countries of eastern and south-eastern europe in proportions to be determined in agreement between the Governmentsof the United Kingdom and the United States.^--Control of Agency Representatives.1. In Allied occupied areas or countries the Zone Commander or the Britishmember of the Allied Control Commission, respectively, will exercise general
supervision and control over the issue of certificates by the Agency and its representatives. In othercountries such supervision will be exercised, as required,by the British Consular authorities.2. In United States and French Occupation Zones Agency representatives will serve under the immediate direction and control of British liaison officers.3. The United Kingdom Government will make appropriate arrangements with the respective Governments and with the Allied. Control Commissions inexperienced-enemy countries in south-eastern Europe for the admission, supervision and functions of Agency representatives in those countries to permit the award of certificates to eligible Jews.
APPENDIX D.Einal Report by the Finance Sub-Committee.1. Our first report was made on the assumption that something like thepresent form of government would continue in Palestine. Our second reportset out to revise our conclusions in the light of the decision to recommend theprovincial plan. It may be convenient if in this our final report we set out ina single document the findings in both reports which apply ,to the provincial plan,and if we also add our recommendations for meeting the financial needs of theproposed new regime in Palestine.2.   We have had three main tasks (a) to investigate the capital programmes that may have to be undertaken in connection with, the immigration of 100.000 Jews (Recommenda-tion 2), to secure the improvement of Arab health and social servicesand the promotion of economic and social measures (Recommenda-tions 5 and 9) and to promote long-term development schemes (Recom-mendation 8) as recommended by the Anglo-American Committee; andto see how far finance is available towards such programmes.(b) to consider the administrative problems involved on the financial side incarrying out the provincial plan.(c) to consider how far the budgets of the central and provincial Govern-ments under the provincial plan will be self-supporting.We deal with each of these problems in turn.The Capital Programmes.(a) Jewish Immigration.3. The immigration of 100,000 persons obviously requires a large capital programme to cover not only their maintenance and housing but also the furtherinvestment of capital in agriculture and industry necessary to provide for their employment. We took as the basis of our studies the estimates prepared by theBritish authorities and by the Jewish Agency respectively. We give below theirfigures together with the figure which our investigations lead us to suggest asthe likely cost of this operation.Item. Original British Jewish Agency Our revised estimate. Estimate. Estimates.Transitional   Assistance 4-9 6-8 to 8-8 housing......... 14 to 28 12-5 to 12-8 14Capital   investment   toprovide     employment for the immigrants ... 85 33 - 8 to 42 - 5 50103 to 117-9 53-1 to 63-1 70We comment on these items in turn.4.   Transitional Assistance. We have taken into account two factors :-(a) Since the British figure was compiled the United States Army haveagreed to provide each immigrant with two months&apos; rations and acertain amount of clothing.   This will reduce the cost;(b) On the other hand, we feel that in actual fact it is more likely that assistance will be provided on the more generous scale contemplated by the Jewish Agency than on the more economical basis assumed bythe British.We reach our figure of  6 millions after taking both factors into account.
5. Housing. The British and Jewish Agency estimates for semi-permanenthousing are virtually the same, and we have adopted the slightly higher Britishfigure of  14 millions. We do not dispute that further money will have to be spent eventually in providing additional housing, but this will be a long-termprocess and in our view can be disregarded when considering the more immediate problem.6. Capital investment to provide employment for the new immigrants. The British figure was built up on the basis of past and current experience inPalestine of the amount of investment needed to provide work for a breadwinner.After taking an assumed figure for the number of persons dependent on thebreadwinner, these calculations gave  565 as the average amount of investmentrequired to provide work for a Jewish immigrant, whether breadwinner ordependent.   We do not dispute the general soundness of this approach.The British went on, however, to assume that, although the current invest-ment figure of  565 might suffice for the first 50,000 immigrants, allowance wouldhave to be made for the progressive difficulties of Palestine industry in dealingwith outside competition. In the British view Palestine industry at that point would have to reorganise itself so that a far higher investment figure would berequired. To allow for this the British bad assumed an investment figure of just double the current figure as being required for the second 50,000.   Thus  m.50,000 (g  565 =        ...............      28-2550,000 O  1,130 ^      ...............      56-5084-75or, say,  85 million.7. The United States Group criticised this conclusion about the second50,000.  In their view, insufficient allowance had been made for two factors : (a) By suitable policy, employment could be assured, without calling on thehigher investment figure needed to enable Palestine industry to compete in world markets at the existing exchange rates;(b) A considerable part of the investment programme would consist of imported goods. The British had assumed that all would be importedat the existing internal Palestine price level of 300. Admittedly,Palestine was at present forced to import from designated sources ofsupply at a c.i.f. price approximating to the internal price level, butas world conditions improve it would be reasonable to assume that a proportion of imports would come from the cheaper sources.8. Both the United States and the British Group admit that this is an extremely speculative item on which it is only possible to make informed guesses.But they suggest that, for current purposes, it might be nearer the mark to put the investment figure at about  50 m. over the next two years without prejudice tothe extent of longer term investment in subsequent years.9. The spread of this programme is important. We think that there is little doubt that this expenditure will be concentrated in the first two years.There is an obvious urge to force the pace. Houses and employment must befound just as fast as conditions permit.10. Sources of finance for this programme. We have considered how far this programme would be suitable for self-liquidating loans and we make thefollowing estimates :  Suitable Not suitableItem.                               for loan. for loan. m.  m.Transitional Assistance        ...       ...           ... 6-0Housing          ............           7-0 7-capital Investment for immigrants...          38-0 12-0450 250[32032] e
11. For meeting this programme, we reckon that the Jewish Agency or theGovernment of the Jewish Province could count on raising some  60m. in the next two years.(a) From Reparations the maximum expectation is  5m.(b) From World Jewry it would not be well to count on more than  20m.Finance from these sources could be applied to the  25m. not suit-able for loan.  For the rest,(c) We put the maximum expectation of the amount that could be raised inloans in Palestine (whether in Palestine pound&quot;s or in sterling) at 35m. It should be noted that in this  35m. we have allowed for theuse of sterling balances in London.12. This leaves a possible deficit of  10m., all of which would be suitable fora self-liquidating loan.13. Responsibility for this programme. The Jewish Agency has publiclyaccepted responsibility for costs connected with the immigration of 100,000 jews to Palestine. This financial responsibility should be confirmed though there wouldbe no need to ask the Agency to agree to any of our specific estimates. In due course the responsibility in question should be transferred to the Government ofthe Jewish Province.14. Nazi assets in Germany. We should record that the existence of these assets will not contribute materially to this immigration scheme. We find that inthe British zone, at any rate, the authorities contemplate that a certain proportionof displaced persons (not Jews) should be permanently settled in Germany. Theycontemplate that this settlement should be financed out of the general Germanbudget. The revenue of. this budget will include receipts from the sale of con-fiscated Nazi assets. To this extent these assets will be contributing to thesesettlement schemes, but no object would be served in formally hypothecating themfor this service. We emphasise that these assets are mark assets and as such canonly be used for expenditure inside Germany. ,15. Another relevant quetion is the claim against the German Treasury inrespect of compensation claims by Jews for property confiscated from them bythe Nazis. The relevance of these claims to the Palestine question is that, even when admitted, these claims can only be met in marks, which are useful only for purchases inside Germany. Any goods required for export from Germany must,under the Quadripartite Agreement, be paid for in dollars. It might help the immigration scheme for the 100,000 if certain building materials in germany could be acquired by the Jewish Agency and we recommend that the authorities inthe Western Zones should look into the possibility of making any such materialsavailable. The Jewish Agency would have to find the dollars and could reasonably expect the transaction to be effected at world prices.(b) The Arab programme.16. We used as the basis of our investigation a tentative survey made bythe Palestine Government as to the cost of implementing recommendations 5 and of the Anglo-American Committee&apos;s Report. These recommendations called for an improvement of educational, health and other social services to bringArab standards in line with Jewish standards and for economic and socialmeasures also designed to raise the Arab standard of living nearer to that ofthe Jews. Such a programme clearly called for a large capital outlay and thePalestine Government reached very tentative conclusions as to the cost involved.These estimates were drawn up, however, on the assumption that something likethe existing form of Government would continue and that the programme wouldbe spread over the whole country of Palestine. In our view under the provincialplan these developments must be carried out in the Arab province alone. Notonly would the Arabs object to a scheme, allegedly for their benefit, which resultedin capital improvements in an area under Jewish control, but there would be considerable administrative difficulties in devising machinery for the spendingand control of the Arab programme in the Jewish province. This concentration of effort in the Arab province makes it necessary to revise the basis of thePalestine Government plan. The economy of the Arab province (which may begauged by its existing revenue of some  1-3 millions) cannot, without disastrousresults, absorb an excessive spending programme. The necessity to find andtrain skilled personnel will also set a limit to the pace at which the educational and social programme can be advanced.
Allowing for all these considerations we tihink that a spending programmeof  15 million to  20 million over 10 years should be regarded as fully adequate to implement the recommendations for improved education, health and economicservices made by the Anglo-American Committee. In addition, up to  10 million should be provided for credit facilities. There are, however, so many unknownfactors in the carrying out of such a programme as that for which we have indicated the  15 million to  20 million target that it would be most unwise to commit ourselves to any public statement as to the amount of the programmes to be undertaken.17. We should mention that the measures to be dealt with in this programme would include the following : (a) Health and Social Services. The provision of a health service for theArabs of a standard similar to that established for the Jews. Theestablishment of social services ancillary to education and health, e.g.,institutions for the care of mothers, children and the old, schoolfeeding, playgrounds, unemployment assistance, the teaching ofhandicrafts, youth and cultural organisations.(b) Education. The immediate provision of compulsory education for theArabs is not practicable, but universal primary education could beachieved in ten years except as regards girls in the smaller villages.Immediate steps should be taken to improve primary, secondary anduniversity education in the Arab community.(c) Economic Measures. Improved facilities for education and for health and other social services will not alone bridge the gap between the standards of living of the two communities; a wide economic advance-ment must accompany them.The greatest part of the Arab rural community, which constitutes66 per cent, of the whole Arab population, consists of a peasantryliving at about bare subsistence level. There are few village industries and Arab industry in general provides very little employment.Measures to improve Arab economic conditions must be directedprimarily to the agricultural population, but should also includemeasures to promote the development of light industries. Theprincipal measures envisaged are the following :  (i) Agrarian reorganisation to rationalise and consolidate landholdings.(ii) Improvement in the use of land : promotion of regional develop-ment: prevention of erosion : agricultural research.(iii) Promotion of light industries and development of local craftsand industries.(iv) Provision of cheap credit.(v) Expansion of labour organisations.(vi) Promotion of the co-operative movement.(d) Living Conditions. We also recommend the following measures for improving living conditions in the Arab community :  (i) Improvements in housing and promotion of housing schemes,(ii) Survey and town planning with a view to improvement schemes,(iii) Improvement of water supplies.18. We do not think it would be of any use at this stage to suggest what proportion of the programme might be assigned to each of these heads. Onlyin respect of credit facilities have we suggested a tentative target of  10 million.19. The spread of the programme and the sources of finance. As we havealready suggested the undertaking of so large a capital programme will impose a considerable strain on the economy of the Arab province. The programme must therefore be spread as far as possible. Delays in recruiting trained social serviceand educational personnel will in any case be a limiting factor. We reckon that,excluding credit facilities, if a programme of between  15 million and 20 million can be achieved over the next ten years that will be the maximumeffort possible and will be a fully adequate implementation of the Anglo-american committee^ Recommendations.20.   Finance for credit facilities should be found from local bank credits.For the rest of the programme we can see no sources of finance in sight from among the Arab community.   We must therefore report that if this programme[32032] &apos; E 2
is to be achieved the whole of the finance for the  15m. to  20m. programme must be found from outside. Of this sum, only a small proportion would be suitable for self liquidating loans.21. We should, perhaps, mention here that the Arab capital programme,though it may compete to some extent with the Jewish so far as materials areconcerned, will not compete for labour. The Arab programme will use localArab or imported labour that for political reasons could not be used on the Jewishprogramme.(c) Long Term Economic Development.22. We should mention among capital requirements the finance required if such long term development schemes as the Hays plan (Recommendation 8)prove practicable. Such schemes will, of course, make it necessary for the CentralGovernment to play a prominent part, e.g., in legislation for the acquisition andreassignment of land, the protection of water rights, &amp;c. At the same time itwill be desirable for the Provincial Governments to take as much responsibilityas is practicable in day to day administration and particularly in finance-Finance should ultimately be made the responsibility of the provinces benefitingby the scheme in proportion to the profits which they derive. The finance shouldbe provided by loan which, if the scheme is practicable, should be self-liquidating.As such it can be secured on the revenue of the scheme reinforced by a generalcharge on provincial revenues. As much as possible of the loan should&apos; be raisedinternally. The external finance may well be considerable, and we trust that international institutions will give sympathetic considerations to the require-ments of such schemes.23. We do not think it would serve any purpose at this stage to suggest how much finance might be required for such projects beyond indicating that it wouldbe considerable.Administrative Problems.24. We now turn to certain administrative problems that arise in thefinancial sphere as a result of the setting up of a Central and three provincial governments, each with its own budget.25. We assume that it is the intention of the provincial plan (P. 30) thatthe Central Government should only administer and collect such taxes as arerequired to defray Central Government services and that all other taxes shouldinure to and be administered by the Provincial Governments. On this generalproposition we offer the following comments.26. We think that excise must be administerd by the Central Government,if only out of administrative necessity. Separate provincial excise systems might result in differential tariffs that would invite smuggling. It would be possibleto administer the tax centrally and still to distribute it to the provincial budgets,but we are against this for the following reasons : (ia) Central Government needs an additional source of revenue.(b) The provinces may well make claims for a share of customs revenue.If they are given a share of excise, they have a far stronger case inlogic for demanding a share of customs.27.   Income Tax. A good case can be made out for making this tax onewhich is both administered by the Central Government and inures to it.(a) A centrally administered system is more efficient.(&amp;) It would be desirable that the Central Government should have somedirect taxation as well as indirect at its disposal.On the other hand :  (i) There might well be practical advantages for different tax systems inthe Jewish and Arab provinces respectively. A different approach and a different kind of machine is necessary to get the best results in each community.(ii) Politically, there is enormous advantage in a locally administered system.This tax has considerable potential yields, but the best results will only be obtained under a system in which each province taxes itselffor its own services.We, therefore, recommend a locally administered system.

28. Subvention of Provincial Governments by Central Government. TheArab province will initially at any rate be unable to balance its budget. TheCentral Government on the other hand might have a surplus. We recommendthat this surplus should be at the free disposal of the Central Government, andthat this power to dispose of a surplus should include the subvention of anyprovincial budget incurring a deficit. Before such help is given, the CentralGovernment should satisfy itself that the Provincial Government in questionis conducting its financial affairs with proper economy and that taxation is being-imposed up to reasonable limits.29. Financial Powers. The Constitution will have to provide for thefinancial powers of the Provincial Governments. We wish to emphasise that ifthe provincial plan is to have any attractions, the utmost autonomy in financial matters should be given to the Provincial Governments consistently with the overall responsibility of the Central Government. We draw attention to threematters, which are of particular importance in this connection : (a) The Provincial Governments should have the power to raise local loans.They should also have the power to take up external loans, but forsuch loans they should first obtain the consent of the CentralGovernment.(b) We attach particular importance .to giving the Provincial governments as much control as possible in the sphere of foreign exchange, since inthe past the control necessarily exercised by the Government ofPalestine owing to war conditions has been a source of considerableresentment. After discussion with the British authorities on thispoint we are bound to recommend that the control of foreign exchange and currency shall for the time being be a function of the CentralGovernment, and that the Central Government shall also for the timebeing be responsible for the licensing of imports. It shall, however,allocate licences equitably between the two Provinces after consulta-tion with their representatives. Moreover, within two years of theintroduction of the provincial autonomy plan (unless a later date is agreed to by the Provinces and the Central Government) a broadallocation of the value of import licences between the two Provincesshall be made from time to time by the Central Government, in con-sultation with the Provinces. Thereafter, the Provinces shall havethe right to obtain for their residents licences up to the amount of theallocation and to decide to what classes of goods such licences shallbe allocated. At a date not later than the 31st December, 1946,import licensing shall be on a non-discriminatory basis as betweensources of supply.If Palestine becomes a member of the United Nations or anyspecialised agencies thereof (including the International monetary fund, the International Bank, or the proposed International trade organisation), the Provincial Governments must deal with all relevant matters within their jurisdiction in a manner consistent withthe obligations of Palestine as a member of these bodies.(c) Although we have recommended that the Provincial Governments shouldhave as much independence as possible in finance, we recognise thatwhen it is a question of making deficiency grants to a Province eitherout of a surplus from the Central Government budget which willhave been collected from the country as a whole or out of a Grant-in-Aid from the Mandatory Power, it will be necessary to provide forsome powers of scrutiny over the budget of the Province. We, there-fore, recommend that the Central Government should not only beempowered to examine and verify provincial and municipal accounts and to prescribe suitable methods of accounts, but that it should also have authority to prescribe the uses of any funds granted by it to theProvinces and to examine proposed budgets of provincial expenditure and to make recommendations with respect to them.30. We should like to emphasise that the Central Government will not beable to use the power of the purse as an effective sanction for securing minorityrights or other policy ends. These objectives must be secured by constitutional and not by financial machinery.
The State of the Central and Provincial Governments&apos; Budgets.31. We now have to estimate how far under the provincial plan the budgetsof the Central Government and of the Governments of the Jewish, Arab andJerusalem areas will be self-supporting.The basis of our estimate of the revenue and expenditure likely to beincluded in the Budgets of the Central and Provincial Governments has been to take the existing figures of revenue and expenditure of the Palestine Govern-ment and to allocate this revenue and expenditure between the three Budgets.Estimates of Revenue.32. The railways, posts and telegraphs and port administration togethercontribute a surplus to the Palestine Treasury, which is considered at a laterpoint. Omitting meanwhile the gross revenue attributable to these services we get some  19 millions as the existing revenue of the Government of Palestinefrom all other sources. The first task is to decide what portion of this revenuewill go to the Central Government.33. The Provincial Plan allocates to the Central Government the following heads of revenue against which we give the current yields :  m.Customs     ...      ...      ...      ... ...      ...      ... 7-00Interest      ...      ...      ...      ... ...      ...      ... &quot;22Repayment of loans        ...      ... ...       ...      ... 33Government properties    ...      ... ...       ...      ... -10Miscellaneous (including currency) ......... -54Court fees   ...      ...      ...      ... ...      - - -      - - - -16Other fees and reimbursements ... ...       ...      ... -779 12We recommend (paragraph 26) that the Central Government should also takeexcise which at present yields  2 - 80 millions. This would bring the revenue ofthe Central Government to  11-92 millions.34. Deducting this  11-92 millions from the present total revenue of 19 millions we get  7-08 millions available for the two Provincial governments and for Jerusalem. We estimate that this revenue which would come from the sources listed below would inure to the three Budgets as follows : .Income taxAnimal tax       ....Property taxes   ...Land registration feesRoad transport ...Fees and taxes ....Other receipts m.JewishProvince.2 100-085-720-660165-8361334-699 m.A robProvince.-230150-375-185-050-218-1481-356 m.Jerusalemenclave.-450015175155039156-0351025 m.7-08035. We should indicate briefly the principles on which we have arrived atthis assumed division of revenue. The Government of Palestine have fairlyextensive statistics as to their sources of revenue. Where these statistics enablerevenue to be allocated with something like scientific accuracy to the two Pro-vinces and Jerusalem we have worked on them. Where such information doesnot exist we have had to work from a more arbitrary basis by assuming thatrevenue will inure to the three areas in proportion to the population of those areas or in accordance with some similar formula, with such weight as can begiven for any factors known to counterbalance an allocation on the populationbasis.
36.   These principles are applied to the main heads of revenue as follows : Income Tax. Here our figures are reasonably scientific. For over 75 percent, of the existing yield of income tax we have information giving the yield from the three areas. Only as to the remaining 25 per cent, do we have to workon an arbitrary basis.Animal Tax. Here we have worked on the proportions attributable to thethree areas given in the census of 1942-43.Property Tax. For this tax we have again got reliable information from thePalestine statistics. It should be noted that though land tax is the most produc-tive Arab tax we still get a higher yield in the Jewish Province. This is accountedfor by the fact that property tax covers the urban property tax which producesa heavy yield in the Jewish cities and by the fact that the land tax is graduatedaccording to the value of the land. Much land in the Jewish agricultural area is more valuable than agricultural land in the Arab area.Land Registration Tax can be attributed with reasonable accuracy from theGovernment statistics.The yield of the Vehicle Tax is based on the last census of vehicles which enables the distribution between the different areas to be calculated with someaccuracy.For the other taxes we have had to use a number of formulae, weighted wherejustified for known factors.37. We do not pretend that our estimates are wholly scientific but the Sub-Committee recommend them as a reasonable attempt to allocate existing revenuesbetween the three areas.Expenditure.38. The existing expenditure of the Government of Palestine (excluding the services of Railways, Posts and Ports) is some  19 millions. The servicesrecommended in P. 30 for retention by the Central Government at present account for the following expenditure :  m.Administration ...       ...       ...      ...       ...      ... 210Antiquities       .................. - 040Audit     ..................... 040Customs..................... -400Legal      ..................... -225Migration         .................. - 050Miscellaneous    ...       ...       ...      ...       ...      ... -100Palestine Broadcasting Service      ...       ...       ... -180Police     ..................... 6 000Prisons   ...       ...       ...      ...      ...       ...       ... -390Public Works*.................. -125Secretariat        ...       ...       ...      ...      ...       ... - 425Statistics          .................. - 090Surveys....................... -225Transjordan Frontier Force ...       ...       ...       ... -043Price subsidisation and control       ...       ...       ... 2-200Probation         ...............      &quot;... -025Public works extraordinary*......       ...       ... -400Loan charges^   ...       ...       ...      ...       ...      ... -240Pensions ...       ...       ...       ...      ...       ...       ... - 07511-48339 We should mention that for one item we have included an arbitraryfigure Central Administration, consisting of the High Commissioner, the secretariat and District Administration at present costs  1 million. We havemade the arbitrary estimate that the central machine will require  425,000 underthis head.* Proportion attributable to Central Government.
Provincial Government Expenditure.40. After allowing  11-483 millions for the Central Government, we are left with  7-517 millions for the three area budgets. The attribution of this figure cannot be made with the same accuracy as in the case of revenue. Ingeneral we can only assume that the spending of the three areas will be inaccordance with their population. Wherever a more scientific formula is availablewe have adopted it. For example, in the case of Public Debt Service, since we know in what areas the capital has been spent, we have allocated the cost of loanservice proportionately.41.   On this basis, we estimate the following distribution of expenditure : Jewish     A rab    Jerusalem..Province. Province. Enclave.Service.Public Debt      ......Administration ...Agriculture, fisheries and forestsCo-op. Societies ...Education ...Local authoritiesHealth and social welfareIncome taxLabourLand registration and settlementMiscellaneousP.W.D..........Supreme Moslem CouncilTown-planning ...Total m.-230141-200-007-460-900-463-074140093-089-450-0093-256 m.-230-152-282-008-625-108-582-0741401621209100400093-442 m.-032022-Oil-002-127-087113-074-070-021-036-215-009-819 m. 7-517The resulting budgetary position.42. On the basis of the above estimates we get the following budgetaryout turns : Central Government   Revenue     ...       ...      ...      ...       ...... 11,920,000Expenditure......      ......... 11,483,000Surplus         ............... 437,000If it continues, the surplus of around   - 7 millions from railroads, ports andposts could be added to this figure.Jewish Province   Revenue     ......       ......     &apos;...... 4,699,000Expenditure         ...       .........      ... 3,256,000Surplus         ...       ...      ......... 1,443,000Arab Province Revenue     .................. 1,356,000Expenditure         ............... 3,442,000Deficit.................. 2,086,000Jerusalem Revenue     ......       ............ 1,025,000Expenditure         ............... 819,000Surplus206,000
43. In the case of the Arab budget, no allowance is made for the increasedannual cost of maintaining the improved education, health and social servicesrecommended by the Anglo-American Committee. A tentative estimate by thePalestine Government puts the anual cost of such improved services at  1-3 mil-lions initially rising in the tenth year to  4-4 millions. We rather doubt whether progress will be sufficiently fast to require such a rate of expenditure,but in so far as it is incurred it will serve to increase the budgetary deficit.44.   We would add the following comment on these estimated out turns :  (a) We have throughout taken the existing figures of expenditure.   In thecase of the provincial Governments some allowance should probably bemade for increased expenditure due to the duplication of administra-tive machinery;(b) Both the British and United States Groups agree that, if there is anyfurther rise in internal prices, there will have to be an addition tothe provision in the Central Governments budget for increased costof living subsidies. The British Group feel that  4 millions shouldbe included for this purpose but the United States Group are not certain that any expenditure will be required under this head;We should perhaps explain why the United States Group differwith the British about their provision for further additions to theexisting provision of  7,650,000 for cost of living subsidies in thePalestine budget. They agree that the Palestine economy (measured by its existing national income of  110 millions and its Governmentbudget of  21 millions) will have to absorb a very large spendingprogramme such as is contemplated, but in their view allowance shouldbe made (i) for the fact that a large part of this programme will consist of imported goods financed with external money;(ii) for the fact that borrowing of some  35 millions mostly from internal sources may be assumed (see paragraph 11);(iii) for the fact that larger supplies of imported consumer goods atlower prices will become available.All the above will tend to counteract the inflationary effect of theprogramme. The United States Group feel unable to estimate whetherprices in Palestine will rise or fall and, therefore, feel unable to endorse the British estimate. The British equally feel bound to include provision for the contingency of rising prices and cannot reduce their estimate to below  4 millions.(c) On the assumption that the provincial plan will be accepted by bothsides, we have made no allowances for any increase in the cost of lawand order, nor for any losses in revenue resulting from disorders and non-co-operation.(d) Initially, the change-over to the (provincial system may cause somedislocation, but apart from this and apart from any further increasein cost of living subsidies, the Central Government budget should showa more substantial surplus. In particular, we look for a considerablebuoyancy in Customs revenue and, granted civil peace, a reductionin the cost of Police and Prisons.(e) In the Jewish Province, there is a large margin with which to cover any increase in expenditure on setting up administrative machineryfor locally administered services and on expanded social services.  Wedo not, however, see how any of this surplus could be diverted to either the Central Government or the Arab Province so long as the existingallocation of functions is maintained.(/) In the Arab Province, we fear that there is little chance of substantially increased revenue for some time till the development and social serviceschemes bring in their harvest of increased income and increasedtaxable capacity.  Expenditure on the capital programme will producesome benefit to the revenue, though mainly to the central Governmenttaxes of Customs and Excise. At best any such benefit to local taxationwill only go to offset increased expenditure following on decentralisation-tion and the estimated increased cost of improving Arab social services( 1-3 millions in the first year rising to  4-4 millions in the tenthyear).[32032] f
Palestine&apos;s Financial Needs.45.   Our studies above lead to the following conclusions : (a) Capital.The Jewish Province may need up to a further  10 millions to financeits immigration scheme. This would all be suitable for a self-liquidatingloan.The Arab Province might need up to  15 millions to  20 millions overthe next ten years. Of this only a small proportion would be suitable fora self-liquidating loan.Long-term economic development will require self-liquidating loans ofconsiderable magnitude. We are unable at this stage to estimate what sumsmight be required.(b) Annual deficits.The budgets of the Jewish province and of Jerusalem should be self-supporting. The budget of the Central Government should show a surplus which, assuming a net profit of some  -7 million from Railways and Ports,and Posts and Telegraphs, might amount to some  1 million. This assumes that there would be no outbreak of disorder or of non-co-operation sufficientto cause a loss of revenue and that internal prices will not rise sufficiently torequire an increase in cost of living subsidies. In the British, but not in theAmerican, view this risk of increased prices is sufficiently serious to justifythe assumption that up to  4 million of additional expenditure might benecessary on this account which would convert the assumed surplus of 1 million into a deficit of  3 million. The Arab budget will have a deficit of  2 million on the basis of existing expenditure which will be increased bythe additional expenditure on improved social services, which we mightestimate very roundly at an average of  1 million a year in the first five years.The Arab deficit of  3 million a year would be reduced by the amount ofany surplus on the Central Government budget. On the more favourablehypothesis  1 million would be available from this source, thus reducing theannual needs of Palestine as a whole to  2 million. On the more gloomyBritish prognostication, the Central Government budget would also show a deficit of up to  3 million, and the overall needs of Palestine would beincreased to  6 million a year. Both the  2 million and the  6 million would be increased by any loss of revenue due to disorder and would bereduced as any increase in tranquillity made it possible to reduce expenditureon law and order.How these Needs might be Met.46. The United States Delegation has agreed to propose to the President ofthe United States that he recommend legislation granting $50 million to theGovernment of Palestine for the purpose of financing development schemes not suitable for self-liquidating loans and for assisting in the meeting of extra-ordinary expenses during the difficulties of the transitional period. The UnitedStates Delegation also recognises that a large proportion of the capital needed for the self-sustaining projects mentioned in paragraphs 10, 20 and 22 must comefrom outside sources. It is possible that Palestine could obtain a loan from theInternational Bank if she becomes a member, but the United States Delegationproposes to recommend that the President of the United States seek legislation authorising, in the event that adequate finance from other sources, such as theInternational Bank, is not available, the making of loans through an appropriateagency for the development of the Middle East region, including Palestine, up to$250 million.47. The United Kingdom delegation for their part propose to recommend to His Majesty&apos;s Government that they should ask Parliament to take ultimate responsibility for meeting recurring deficits up to the time when increasedrevenues may allow them to be met out of Arab provincial or Central Governmentfunds.48. The British proposal would provide for the recurrent deficit under theprovincial plan which they estimate at  6 millions a year (reduced to  2 millionsif internal prices do not in fact rise).
49. The United States proposed grant of $50 millions should care for expenditure sufficient to ensure that the Arab capital programme be effectivelycarried forward to the period&apos;when means of additional financing may be found.The proposed United States loan of $250 millions would provide for the assumeddeficit on the Jewish capital programme, will be available towards any partof the Arab programme suitable for self-liquidating loans and could be used for financing the long-term economic development schemes.
