(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (46)  501 COPY NOS7TH JULY.,  1946.CABINETCONFERENCE ON PALESTINE3%INVITATIONS TO JEWS AND PALESTINE ARABSMemorandum by the Secretary of state for  the- Colonies1.      The States Members of the Arab League have been invitedto send delegations to London &quot;to enter into negotiations onthe subject of Palestine&quot;, in accordance with the under-taking that His Majesty&apos;s Government would consult all parties concerned before reaching a decision on the recommendationsof the Anglo-American Committee of Enquiry.      The date of theproposed conference will,  if possible, be so arranged as toenable the conversations to take place before the session ofthe United Nations General Assembly which, as at present planned, will begin on the 23rd September.      This invitationhas been published and it  has also been intimated that it isintended to invite representatives of the Palestine Arabs andof the Jews.2.      As regards the Palestine Arabs, the invitation will presumably be addressed to  the Arab High Executive (which hasrecently taken the place of the former &quot;Arab higher committee&quot;), of which the Vice-Chairman is Jamal Husseini.The Chairmanship of this Executive has been left vacant forthe Mufti and the Executive would no doubt wish to nominatehim as head of their delegation.      I recommend, however, that,in convoying an invitation to the Executive,  the HighCommissioner should make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would not be prepared to accept the   Mufti&apos;s nomination.I propose also to ask the High Commissioner if he considers the Arab Higher Executive sufficiently representative of thePalestine Arabs or if he would wish to issue additionalinvitations  to any individuals.      At the St.   James&apos;s PalaceConference (193S-39)  two representatives of the Defence party were included in the   -alestine Arab Delegation, which other-wise consisted of persons who, in effect, represented theArab Higher Committee.3.      As regards the Jews,  the position is more difficult,On the occasion of the St.  James&apos;s Palace Conference,  the invitation on the- Jewish side was addressed to the jewish agency, who were asked &quot;to nominate representatives to attend the forthcoming discussions&quot;.      This invitation was accompanied by a personel letter from the then Secretary ofIState for the Colonies to Dr. Weizmann, in which he wrote -&quot;No suggestion is contained in the official letter with regardto the numbers or composition of the Jewish Agency delegationas it Was felt that these are matters on which it was hardlyappropriate for the Government to lay down any principles.On the latter point I have, nothing to add to what I said toyou in recent conversations.      As regards numbers, I realise the difficulties with which you may have to contend, but i hope that it will be found possible  to limit the delegation to a reasonably small number&quot;.      The list of names submitted

by the Jewish Agency before the commencement of the conference is appended to  this paper.      It will be seen that, besidesmembers of the Jewish Agency Executive,  the delegationincluded Jews from the United Kingdom,  the United States,Prance, Belgium and Palestine, besides representatives ofAgudath Israel and the Board of Deputies.4.      It seems  appropriate once more on the occasion of theforthcoming conference to extend an invitation to the jewish agency.      It was made clear that th - operations commencingon 29th June were not directed against the Agency as such, butonly against those responsible for instigating and directingthe campaign of violence, and that it was not the intentionat that time to proscribe the Agency.      So long as HisMajesty&apos;s Government continue to recognise the Agency, itscorns appropriate that the latter,  in view of its position under the Mandate, should be  taken into  consultation as the-principal body representative of the interests of world Jewryin Palestine.      I suggest,  however, that,  in conveying an invitation to Dr. Weizmann, I should make it clear (and this could perhaps best bo done orally)  that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-nent will not be prepared to accept as delegates members ofthe Executive now in detention or Mr. Ben Gurion (who wouldhave been detained had he been in Palestine).      The Zionistswill no doubt point to the fact that the Arab leaders then in detention in the Seychelles were rel ased to take part in the st.  James&apos; s Palace Conference (though not allowed to enterPalestine);    but, in view of the recent publication of evidenceimplicating the detained leaders,  I should see very greatobjection to any concession in this matter on the present occasion.      Apart from anything else, I fear that the releaseof the detainees would have a grave effect on the morale ofthe Services in Palestine.5.      Although, however, I recommend that the Jewish agency should be asked to take part in the discussions, I do notthink it appropriate, in the light of its recent record, thatthe Agency should,  on this occasion, be asked to nominateJewish representatives other than members of its Executive.I propose that the selection of such members of the Jewishdelegation should be left to myself, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.      I should see noobjection (and it would indeed be my intention) to consultDr. Weizmann and the Chairman of the Board of Deputies ofBritish Jews on this matter,  in his purely private capacity.6.      To sum up, I recommend -(i)    that an invitation to  th e forthcoming negotiations should be addressed to the Palestine Arab HigherExecutive on the understanding that the Mufti wouldnot be an acceptable delegate and  that the HighCommissioner will be consulted on the question of adding any other names to the Palestine Arabdelega tion;(ii)    that an invitation  should be extended to the jewish agency to nominate as representatives members of itsExecutive,  excluding Mr,  Ben Gurion and those now in detention;    and(lii)    that the Jewish delegation should be completed by the nomination of representatives of other interests(including, for example, Agaduth Israel) by myself,in consultation with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,   and after taking advice fromDr. Weizmann and the Chairman of the Bo.or a of Deputiesof British Jews and such others as I considerappropr late,G.H.H.Colonial Office,Downing Street, S.W..1.27TH JULY.   1946. -2-
