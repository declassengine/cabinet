(46) 345.11th September, 1946.CABINET.CENTRAL ORGANISATION FOR DEFENCE.Note by the Prime Minister.IN the White Paper on Defence (Cmd. 6743) which was debated on the4th March, 1946, His Majesty&apos;s Government announced their intention of putting forward at an early date their proposals for our post-war defence organisation.2. I have been reviewing this problem for some months past, with theassistance of the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs. We have taken steps to ascertain the views of a number ofthose who were closely associated with the central organisation for defence duringthe recent war, including Mr. Churchill and leading Conservative members ofthe Coalition Government. Our object has been to study the lessons of the past and to apply them in remodelling our defence organisation for the future.3.   Our conclusions and recommendations are set out in the attached report.Our central organisation for defence, as it exists to-day, is the result ofsteady evolution throughout the twentieth century; and the changes which we now recommend are designed to carry that process of evolution a stage further,rather than to make any drastic break with the past. Part I of our Reporttherefore consists of an historical review tracing the development of the existing organisation.Part II contains our comments and criticisms. It describes some of the defects which were disclosed in the organisation as it developed. It also discussessome of the alternative forms of organisation which have from time to timecommanded a measure of public support, e.g., the &quot; Combined General Staff,&quot;and indicates our reasons for rejecting these alternatives.Part III contains our recommendations for the future. A brief summaryof the organisation proposed is contained in paragraph 36. Its main featuresare described in greater detail in the following paragraphs.4. We now submit these recommendations for consideration by the Cabinet.We propose that, if they are approved, they should be announced in a white paper, of which a draft is annexed to this memorandum. We contemplate thatthe White Paper should be presented to Parliament early in the new Session.It is our intention that the new organisation should be brought into being atthe beginning of the financial year 1947-48.5. Before the White Paper is published, it will be necessary to communicate to Dominion Governments a general outline of the new organisation proposed,and also to give them an opportunity for detailed comment on the text of paragraphs 52 to 55, which relate specifically to collaboration with the Dominions.It is proposed that this approach to Dominion Governments should be made assoon as our proposals have been approved by the Cabinet.C. R. A.10, Downing Street, S.W.1,11th September, 1946.

CENTRAL ORGANISATION FOR DEFENCE.REPOET OF MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE.I. HISTORICAL REVIEW.1. The year 1904 marks the real beginning of our central organisation for defence. The defects in our military machinery brought to light bythe Boer War led to the appointment of Lord Esher&apos;s War Office (Recon-stitution) Committee, which in its first Report dated January, 1904, madethe following statement:  The British Empire is pre-eminently a great naval, Indian, and colonial Power. There are nevertheless no means for co-ordinatingdefence problems, for dealing with them as a whole, for defining theproper functions of the various elements, and for ensuring that, on theone hand, peace preparations are carried out upon a consistent plan,and, on the other hand, that in time of emergency a definite war policy,based upon solid data, can be formulated.&quot;The remedy proposed and adopted was the establishment of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, which came into existence under a Treasury Minutedated 4th May, 1904.2. The founders of the Committee of Imperial Defence were concerned to design a mechanism which would not run counter to current conceptionsof Cabinet government, and would not interfere with the collective and individual responsibility of Ministers to Parliament. The Committee ofImperial Defence was therefore established as an advisory body; but in orderthat its recommendations should carry due weight, the Prime Minister wasmade the Chairman and only permanent member. He was given absolutediscretion in ihe selection of persons, whether Ministers, officials, or experts,to attend its meetings. This arrangement secured to the new body bothauthority and flexibility. A small permanent Secretariat was established to arrange the business and keep the records of the Committee and thus to provide continuity in its proceedings.3. In the decade before the war of 1914-18 the first task of theCommittee of Imperial Defence was to formulate principles to govern our defence policy. Sub-Committees were set up to examine the various aspectsof defence preparations and the military needs of the Empire. The risingpower of Germany, and the clear signs of her aggressive intentions, made it necessary to review the whole field of preparation for a war with Germany.It also became necessary to study the action which would be required in everysphere of Government activity in the precautionary stage and on the out-break of war, and to draw up what might be termed a central mobilisationscheme or War Book. The War Book was not concerned with the conductof war nor with the naval and military plans which would have to be putinto execution if war came. Its object was to ensure that the transition frompeace to war could be made with the least possible difficulty and dislocation,both in the Government machine and in the general life of the nation.4. In this early stage of its career the Committee of Imperial defence was able to do little to co-ordinate the formulation of operational plans. Itwas still not realised how much interdependence there would be in war between the actions of the Navy and the Army, or to what extent these would be governed by considerations of man-power and productive capacity.There was no Chiefs of Staff Committee. Nevertheless a start was made inthe direction of co-ordination by virtue of the fact that the high authorities of the Service and other Departments were brought together for regular and frequent consultation within the framework of the Committee of ImperialDefence. The discussion of imperial defence problems was also assisted bythe occasional presence of representatives of the self-governing Dominions.5. The outbreak of the war in 1914 thus found us with carefully thought-out plans for the transition from peace to war, and with far better machinerythan we had ever had before for concerting the actions of GovernmentDepartments in war, but without any central machinery for inter-Serviceplanning or for conducting war on a large scale. The Committee of ImperialDefence was essentially an organisation to co-ordinate preparations, ratherthan to take executive control in war. For the first two years of the war we were groping to find a suitable system to take its place, and it was not until December, 1916, that the War Cabinet was set up. Meeting every day,and attended by the Ministers and expert advisers directly concerned, it pro-vided an effective machinery for co-ordination and a clearing-house for the mass of urgent problems arising from the war. There was still, however, no inter-Service planning organisation.   The need for this was not clearly seen until
after the formation of a third fighting Service, the Eoyal Air Force. before then operations, unless they involved a landing in the face of the enemy,were regarded either as naval operations or as land operations. Plans weremade and operations were conducted quite separately by the Admiralty orthe &quot;War Office. The only amphibious operation of any size which took placewas the Dardanelles campaign, the failure of which can be directlyattributed to the lack of centralised inter-Service control.6. The advent of the third Service gradually brought about a changein outlook. It came to be realised that there was hardly a single operationof war which would not involve at least two of the Services, and that successwould not be achieved unless warlike operations were looked at as a whole and the efforts of the three Services were directed centrally to a commonplan. The Salisbury Committee of 1923 on National and Imperial Defencepaid particular attention to the need for co-operation between the Services,and their report (Cmd. 2029) gave rise to the establishment in 1924 of theChiefs of Staff Committee and the foundation of the joint staff system.Meanwhile the Committee of Imperial Defence had been re-established, inJune, 1920, and with its many sub-committees had resumed the work ofreviewing defence preparations over the whole field of civil and military activity.7. In the years between 1923 and 1935 there was continuing developmentof the Committee of Imperial Defence and the new Chiefs of Staff committee with its Joint Staffs for Planning and Intelligence. The latter graduallybecame a well-knit and smooth working machine, which was expanded duringthe period of re-armament and during the early part of the second world warinto the organisation which was fully described in the White Paper laid beforeParliament in 1942 (Cmd. 6351).8. Hitler&apos;s advent to power in 1933 made it necessary that the&apos;work ofdefensive preparation should be pushed forward at ever increasing speed.The task of re-armament was not easy, even though it became more obviousas the years went by that war was sooner or later inevitable. The proportionof the national resources of money and productive capacity which couldbe diverted from peaceful uses to warlike preparations was limited. Thetask which had to be undertaken by our central defence organisation was thus to try to ensure that the best possible use was made of the resources available, and at the same time to make careful plans so that when war broke out munitions industries could be rapidly expanded.9. It was felt at this time that there was need for a Minister who could give his whole attention to this subject and who could, under thegeneral direction of the Prime Minister, survey the whole programme andco-ordinate preparations. This led to the appointment, in March 1936, ofa Minister for Co-ordination of Defence. The Ministers functions were co-ordinating and not executive. He had no overriding powers. He operatedthrough the machinery of the Committee of Imperial Defence, of which hewas Deputy Chairman, and through certain of its special sub-committees,such as the Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Principal Supply OfficersCommittee.10. The outbreak of the war in 1939 found us with plans fully preparedboth for the transition from peace to war and for the setting up of machineryfor the conduct of war. A War Cabinet was immediately established, whichworked with the assistance of the Chiefs of Staff Committee and otherCommittees taken over from the Committee of Imperial Defence. TheMinister for the Co-ordination of Defence at first remained in office, as amember of the War Cabinet, but his position was anomalous. He could notcontrol the mobilisation and direction of the whole resources of the nationfor total war, a task which of necessity falls to the Prime Minister, norhad he any specific responsibility for knitting together the actions of thethree Services. The post was abolished in April, 1940, and not long after-wards Mr. Churchill became Prime Minister and assumed the additionaltitle of Minister of Defence.11. The duties of the Prime Minister as Minister of Defence were neverdefined. It was left for Mr. Churchill to develop a method of working throughthe Defence Committee and the Chiefs of Staff Committee, which enabledhim to provide the drive without which successful warlike operations cannotbe conducted. In the course of this development certain changes affectingthe position of the Service Ministers gradually took place.12. The Chiefs of Staff in their corporate capacity became the authority which issued operational instructions to Commanders-in-Chief. Previouslythese instructions had been issued under the authority of, tho Board ofAdmiralty, the Army Council, and the Air Council respectively. It was soonfound that in nearly every theatre of war the actions of the three services were so bound up together that it was essential for the Commanders-in-Chief, who were working together as a team, to receive unified strategical
directives from, and-,, to forward their views jointly for consideration by,the Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Defence Committee. A channel ofcommunication was opened up from the Chiefs of Staff to Commanders-in-Chief which became in all major strategical matters the sole channel forimparting guidance on the conduct of the war. The day-to-day administration of the Services remained the responsibility of the service departments, who followed up the central directives issued by the Chiefsof Staff with detailed instructions to their own Commanders-in-Chief onsuch matters as the composition, equipment, and movement of the forces under their command, and the provision of reinforcements and supplies.13. The entry of America into the war led to the establishment of the combined Chiefs of Staff in Washington. In several theatres of warSupreme Allied Commanders were appointed, and they received their instructions from the Combined Chiefs of Staff. These events, and the close relations which developed between the President of the United Statesand the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of the United Kingdom,reinforced the need for the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of staff committee to assume full control over operations and plans.14. These developments took from the hands of the Service ministers the main responsibility for the operational control of the forces in the field.They were still associated with the conduct of the war through their membership of the Defence Committee (Operations), which examined onbehalf of the War Cabinet the military plans and projects prepared by theChiefs of Staff and the Joint Staffs. This Committee was composed ofthe Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (in the Chair), the deputy prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, the Minister of Production, theService Ministers, and the Chiefs of Staff. Other Ministers attended fromtime to time for the discussion of matters directly affecting their Depart-mental responsibilities. A parallel body, the Defence Committee (Supply),enabled the Minister of Defence to review the main lines of our production programmes.15. During the war great progress was made in the direct associationof scientists with the work of Service and other Departments. It is notpossible in this report to give a full account of this association. It is enoughto say that in the design and development of weapons and equipment, inthe study of tactical methods, and in foreseeing and counteracting theenemy&apos;s technical progress, scientists played an invaluable part. It wasmade clear during the war that any future development in our higher defence organisation would be incomplete if it did not provide throughout for the closest possible integration of scientific and military men.16. No Ministry of Defence was created during the war. The Ministerof Defence operated by bringing together from the Service departments and elsewhere those Ministers or officials who would be responsible for theexecution of plans when approved. He used as his. staff the small militarySecretariat of the War Cabinet, which had previously served the Committeeof Imperial Defence. The military head of the Secretariat became his chief Staff Officer and a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. The task of the Secretariat was to draft reports and telegrams on behalf of the Chiefsof Staff, to ensure co-ordination and continuity in the activities of thevarious committees and sub-committees dealing with military questions,and generally to facilitate the smooth running of the inter-Service machine.It was not their duty to act as military advisers to the Minister of Defence.It was their duty to procure for him advice from those who would beresponsible for action.II. COMMENTAEY AND CBITICISM.17. This short sketch of the development of our central war machineshows that there are two clearly defined phases for which machinery hasto be devised. One is the phase of preparation and planning which takes place in peace-time, the other is the phase of execution in war. So far wehave relied upon the Committee of Imperial Defence, with its well establishedsystem of sub-committees binding together the many and varied interests concerned with preparations for war, to carry us through the first phase.We have evolved the War Cabinet system to handle war. It is now necessaryto examine whether these two systems, one for peace and the other forwar, as developed and improved through the passage of years, have provedthemselves generally sound, and in what respects they have been foundwanting.18. Paradoxically, it is our peace-time organisation which is the moreimportant of the two. In war-time, when all energies are bent to the achievement of a single object, defects in organisation rapidly come to light,and can be rectified. The machine has to be adjusted to suit the personalitiesin power at the time, and to suit the conditions which, can rarely be foreseen
with exactitude. In peace-time, however, when danger seems remote, andthere is a natural reluctance to make adequate provision for defence, it isof great importance that our higher defence organisation should be as effective as possible, so that full value for money can be secured and the nationwill not live in a fooPs paradise. Furthermore, a sound organisation built up in peace will facilitate the task of adjustment to war conditions whenthe time comes.19. In all those aspects of defence preparation which involve the close co-ordination of departmental action we were fully prepared both in 1914and in 1939. There was no hitch in the smooth transition from peace to war.The administrative details, in both the military and the civil field, had beenfully thought out. There can be no question that, as a means of ensuring that every aspect of preparation for war was brought up and investigated,the Committee of Imperial Defence proved its value. The authority which it possessed through having the Prime Minister as its Chairman,and the great flexibility of its organisation, fulfilled the expectations ofits founders.20. In many other respects, however, the Services found themselvesin 1939 dangerously unprepared. Qualitatively our Navy and Air force were not badly equipped, but there were dangerous gaps. We were woefullyshort of destroyers and other escort vessels. We were inadequately supplied with aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery. Our Army was so small, and sobadly equipped, and had so little munitions production behind it, that ifthe fighting on the Continent in 1940 had been prolonged we should soonhave been short of every kind of ammunition. Our weaknesses overseaswere even more striking. What was lacking in our system to account forthese deficiencies?21. No answer to this question can be complete which does not extend beyond the field of organisation and take into account the political back-ground of the time. Thus, even after Hitler&apos;s advent to power in Germany,the main preoccupation of the British Government was still the DisarmamentConference, and feeling in the country was strongly in favour of the avoidance of war by action through the League of Nations. The reluctance to make full-scale preparations for another war continued through 1935 and1936, when evidence was accumulating about the intentions of the germans and the Japanese and the Abyssinian crisis was upon us. It was generally felt that warlike preparations were provocative, and it was not realised thata fundamental condition of collective security was that individual nations should be strong. The financial crisis, too, made it difficult for the Govern-ment to embark on thorough-going schemes of rearmament which could hardly be paid for without impinging upon the programme of social ameliorative-tion upon which all hopes were fixed. Hence the general scale of our preparations was inadequate.22. But, leaving aside political considerations, there was a real source of weakness in the absence from the organisation of the Committee ofImperial Defence of a guiding hand to formulate a unified defence policy for the three Services. There was a tendency for separate aspects of ourdefences to be examined one by one. For example, the Admiralty building programme, the strength of the Metropolitan Air Force, the number of guns and searchlights to be deployed in the Air Defence of Great Britain,the equipment of the Field Force each of these subjects came up for review separately. The only conspectus of our &quot;armed forces and their requirements was that which was compiled for financial purposes by addingthe separate components together. Our system failed to secure that broadbut thorough examination of Service jirogrammes which alone could ensurethat, if war came, we should be ready in all important respects to meet it.23. This weakness was not remedied by the appointment of the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence. His duties were strictly limited toco-ordinating, and he had no power to take executive action. He was not given responsibility to Parliament, nor did he have any jurisdiction overthe apportionment of the available resources between the three Services.24. These needs were met during the war through the assumptionby the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence of a much closer gripover military policy through the medium of the Defence Committeeand the Chiefs of Staff organisation. The operations of the three services, and the main lines of their production programmes, were in this manner brought into close relationship with each other, and emerged asparts of a comprehensive plan. Our future security will depend upon our success in making use of the experience so gained to improve our permanentpeace-time system.25. Preparation for war involves two processes. The first concernsevery department of State, and involves a review of all government activity in peace-time, and the preparation of plans for its regulation upon theoutbreak of war.   It is this process for which the Committee of Imperial
Defence was so well designed. No Minister other than the Prime Ministercan preside over this all-embracing field. None but he can balance the competing claims of national security and of civil welfare. But once theGovernment of the day, having balanced these conflicting claims uponnational income and weighed up the general political situation, havedecided the general level of defence preparation, they must be assured that their decision will be reflected in a sound defence policy and that therewill be no waste of effort. The defence system must be the best that canbe got with the available resources of money and man-power. This is theobject of the second process, which concerns the armed forces and their equipment for war. It involves a study of the strategical situation in all its aspects, a continuous review of scientific and technical development as affecting weapons and equipment and the organisation of forces, and the study of war potential and man-power; it demands a careful apportionment of effort between the three Services.26. How is this unified defence policy to be achieved? One method would be to amalgamate completely the three Services, and to place them under a single Minister of the Crown. This idea has been advocated bysome as the logical development of the close relationship which has been built up during the war between the operation of forces by sea, land, and air and as a means of giving full play to scientific development in weapons.We do not reject the conception as something which might be found desirable at some stage in the future. We believe, however, that amalgama-tion is a step which could not and should not be taken here and now.27. Another method which has been suggested from time to time is thecreation of what is sometimes called a &quot; Oombined General Staff.&quot; Criticsof our organisation have contended that the Chiefs of Staff Committee, andthe Joint Staffs for Planning, Intelligence, and Administrative Planning which work for it, do not form a combined General Staff in the sense of an impartialcentral organisation which plans operations without regard for Serviceprejudice or sectional interests. The Joint Staff, they say, merely producesthe highest common factor among the views of the three Service Depart-ments. A true Combined General Staff would be formed from speciallyselected and trained officers removed from their own Services, and weldedfirmly into a central organisation with a single professional head. Thisconcei^tion sounds attractive to those who have no great experience of theconduct of large operations. They imagine it .to be the method successfullyadopted by the Germans in the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht. Our own experience, and a close study of the working of the German system whichhas been made possible by the capture of the German archives, combine to demonstrate that this conception is not only inferior to our Joint Staffsystem, but has certain fatal defects.28. War plans can only be made as a result of a careful study of intelligence, a full and detailed knowledge of the resources available, both to ourselves and to the enemy, and all the other relevant circumstances asthey exist at the time. A Planning Staff must thus have at its disposala great mechanism for collecting and presenting all the information thatis required. The idea that a kind of &quot; Brains Trust &quot; consisting of a small number of high-powered Staff Officers working on their own can producepractical plans is entirely fallacious. A central Planning Staff, therefore,can only work in one of two ways. It must either set up its own independentorganisation to gather the information it requires, in which ease it willbe duplicating the greater part of the organisation which exists in the service departments; or it must make use of the existing organisation by bringing together into a Joint Staff officers drawn from the Service departments and having at their disposal the whole of their departmental machinery.War plans centrally prepared have to be translated into action through themachinery of the Service Departments, and it follows that the officers who make the plans should be those who have the responsibility for ensuring within the Service Departments that they can be put into execution. The members of the planning staff must not only be menchosen for their personal ability and experience, but they must be ableto speak with the full weight of their Departments behind them.29. The German system failed because the Planning Staffs of O.K.W.were not drawn from the headquarters of the three Services. The plansthey produced had later to be handed to those headquarters for execution,and were often found to be unrealistic. The cleavage between planning and execution set up dangerous antagonisms, and entirely nullified anytheoretical advantages of the German system.30. It has always been a cardinal principle of the British organisation that, alike in the Chiefs of Staff Committee and in the Joint Staff, it shouldbe the men responsible in the Service Departments for carrying out the approved policy who are brought together in the central machine to formulateit. The soundness of this principle has been amply proved in the testingpractical experience of war. and the methods employed in the British
organisation were adopted without alteration in the machinery of the combined Chiefs of Staff, and at the various Anglo-American headquartersformed in the field.31. It has sometimes been suggested that, even though our Joint Staffsystem is based on sound principles, it would be improved by the appoint-ment of an independent Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. It iscontended that a Chairman who would not be burdened with the heavyresponsibilities carried by the professional heads of the three fightingServices would be in a good position to supervise the working of the wholemachine, and to ensure that the Chiefs of Staff Committee addressed itselfto those problems of greatest importance at any given moment and didnot get drawn away into the discussion of less important details. Some havesuggested that the Chairman should be a civilian of wide experience andproved ability, who would be able to take an impartial view of questionswhich have inter-Service implications. Others have proposed that theChairman should be an ex-Chief of Staff, who would thus have professionalknowledge but would be less likely to be bound to the viewpoint of one service.32. A civilian Chairman could only be what can be called a businessmanager. By hypothesis he could not form a professional view on Serviceproblems, and he would be taking upon himself a very grave responsibilityif he attempted to influence the advice which the Chiefs of Staff in theircorporate capacity render to the Defence Committee and the Cabinet. Hewould have no part in the execution of the strategy and plans agreed upon,nor could he properly act as the mouthpiece of the Committee at Ministerialmeetings. The dangers which would surround the appointment of a civilianwould more than counterbalance the supposed advantages of having an impartial Chairman.33. The alternative suggestion proves no more attractive on examination.If an ex-Chief of Staff was to express a professional view in Committee,from whom would he get his information and advice? Would he have afull Staff of his own to keep him abreast of developments in all three services, to provide him with intelligence, and to work for him on projects?If so, the arrangement would be highly dangerous. A personal staff of thekind that would thus be developed, without responsibility for the executionof the policies advocated, is a form of organisation which should be avoidedat all costs. But even if it proved possible in some manner to avoid this danger, is it to be supposed that the Chairman would be in a positionto over-rule his colleagues, or even to give a casting vote? Would hisopinion carry weight, for example, on a matter involving the Navy, in opposition to that given by the First Sea Lord, with the full backing ofthe Naval Staff? It is evident that the Chairman, even if he were adistinguished ex-Chief of Staff, could only act as business manager, andwould have to leave professional matters to those who carry the responsibility and are thus entitled to advise.34. In point of fact, the criticism on this score tends to ignore thefacts as they exist, and as they have existed for many years. It has alwaysbeen recognised that, whenever he sees fit, the Prime Minister can himselfpreside at meetings of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. Before the war, theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence was also empowered to assemble theCommittee and to take the Chair himself. During the war, there were many occasions on which the Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister of Defencedid preside over the Chiefs of Staff Committee, and at all times he took amost active part in directing the work of the Committee in accordance withthe demands of the general situation. By this means the Prime minister was able to place ideas before the Chiefs of Staff for professionalexamination, to keep them in touch with political matters which hadmilitary implications, and thus to direct in a broad way the work of thewhole Joint Staff. The Prime Minister did not, however, act as the mouth-piece of the Chiefs of Staff before the Cabinet and Defence Committee.III.- PROPOSALS.85&apos;. Outline of New Organisation Proposed. After reviewing thedevelopment of our defence organisation over the last forty years and- its practical performance under the test of two major wars, we are satisfiedthai. Micro are no grounds for any drastic recasting of the main structure ofthe organisation as it&apos; exists to-day. Some changes are. however, requiredin order to consolidate Hie advances which have been made in the histten years under the compulsion of war or of the threat of war. Above all.experience during thoso years has shewn the need of a Minister who hasiii.il.lt tlin time and the authority lo formulate and apply a unified defence policy fur Uie three Services; and we propose that this need should he met by die creation of a Minister of Defence,
36. The form of the organisation which we propose may be summarisedas follows:  (a) The Prime Minister will retain the supreme responsibility for defence.(6) The Defence Committee, under the Chairmanship of the PrimeMinister, will take over the functions of the old Committee ofImperial Defence, and will be responsible both for the review of current strategy and for co-ordinating departmental action in preparation for war.(c) A new post of Minister of Defence, with a Ministry, will be created.The Minister of Defence will be responsible to Parliament forcertain subjects, which are defined in paragraph 42 below, affectingthe three Services and their supply. In addition, he will beDeputy Chairman of the Defence Committee, and he will also take the Chair at the Chiefs of Staff Committee whenever he orthe Chiefs of Staff so desire.(d) The Chiefs of Staff Committee will remain responsible for preparingstrategic appreciations and military plans, and for submitting themto the Defence Committee; and the Joint Staff system will beretained and developed under their direction.(e) The Service Ministers will continue to be responsible to parliament for the administration of their own Services in accordance withthe general policy approved by the Cabinet, and within theresources allotted to them.The above summary is elaborated in the following paragraphs.37. The Defence Committee. The appointment of a Minister ofDefence will relieve the Prime Minister of that part of his general responsi-bility for national defence which is concerned with the inter-relation of thethree fighting Services raid their supply. There remains, however, theorganisation for national defence in its broader aspect, including both currentquestions of high policy in the sphere of defence, and also the preparationof plans over the whole field of government activity, both civil and military,for mobilising the entire resources of the nation in a major war. these problems engage the collective responsibility of the Government as a whole.They must, therefore, be handled under the authority of the Cabinet itself.38. We propose that the Defence Committee should deal withthese problems, under the Cabinet. It will be responsible both forthe review of current strategy and also for the preparation of plans forthe country&apos;s transition from peace to war, and will thus discharge the taskscarried out before the war by the Committee of Imperial Defence.39. The Prime Minister will be Chairman of the Defence Committee.Its composition will be flexible. The Prime Minister, Dord President ofthe Council, Foreign Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Minister ofDefence, the Service Ministers and the Minister of Supply will be regularmembers of the Committee, and the Chiefs of Staff will be in attendance.Such other Ministers, officers and officials as may be required will be invitedto attend meetings of the Committee, according to the subjects underdiscussion.40. The preparation of plans for mobilising the nation&apos;s resources inwar will, as stated above, involve the collaboration of almost all governmentagencies, both civil and military. This task will be undertaken by a systemof Sub-Committees working under the general direction and authority ofthe Defence Committee. These Sub-Committees will be constituted mainlyat the official level, as were the Sub-Committees of the Committee ofImperial Defence before the war, and will include representatives of theServices, Service Departments, and Civil Departments, and, where necessary, persons outside government service altogether. - :41. The Prime Minister must be Chairman of the Defence Committee,by virtue of his ultimate responsibility for national defence. When inter-national relations are stable, however, it will be neither possible nor necessaryfor him to attend all the meetings of the Committee; and it is desirablethat he should have as Deputy Chairman a senior Minister who can relievehim of as much as possible of the detailed work of supervising the prepara-tion of our defence plans. The Minister of Defence will assume this responsibility. In this capacity he will be able to exercise a general super-vision over the preparations which are being made for national defence as awhole through the various Sub-Committees of the Defence Committee.42. Functions of the Minister of Defence. The functions of the Ministerof Defence will be as follows:  (a) The apportionment, in broad outline, of available resources betweenthe three Services in accordance with the strategic policy laid downby the Defence Committee. This will include the [raining ofgeneral policy to govern research and development, mid thecorrelation of production  programmes.
(b) The settlement of questions of general administration on which acommon policy for the three Services is desirable.(c) The administration of inter-Service organisations, such as combined operations Headquarters and the Joint Intelligence Bureau.The Minister will bring his proposals under (a) before the Defence Com-mittee and the Cabinet. He will present the Cabinet&apos;s decisions on these toParliament, and will decide questions arising between the three services in their application. He will not be responsible for the subsequent detailedexecution of the approved programmes, which will be the task of the Serviceand Supply Ministers. As a consequence of (b), he will answer questions in Parliament on matters common to the three Services or to the three services and the Ministry of Supply. The machinery through which theMinister will discharge his responsibilities is described below.43. The Apportionment of Resources. The new organisation must be such as to ensure that the resources available for defence are laid out to the best advantage in terms of manpower, weapons and equipment,works services, amenities, &amp;c. A beginning was made this year witha new procedure for determining Service Estimates in total, whichit is proposed to develop so as to enable provision for Defence to bedealt with as a single problem in the light of the economic positionand strategic requirements of the country. The Chiefs of Staff will advise the Defence Committee on our strategic requirements from year to year. It will then be for the Service Departments to translatethese requirements into terms of men, money and supplies, and for theMinister of Defence to present the co-ordinated result to the DefenceCommittee in the form of a coherent scheme of expenditure which will givethe country forces and equipment in properly balanced proportions. on production questions there will be a Standing Ministerial production committee consisting of the Service Ministers and the Minister of Supply,over which the Minister of Defence will preside. Working for this Com-mittee there will be a Joint War Production Staff composed of serving officers and civil representatives of the Service and Supply Departments,the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Labour. With the help of this organisation, and of the Committee of Service Ministers referred to inparagraph 45 below, the Minister of Defence will be able to frame com-prehensive defence proposals in the form of a consolidated estimate for presentation to the Defence Committee and the Cabinet.44. Peace-time production programmes cannot be determined without regard to questions of war potential. The size of peace-time stocks of equipment must be related to the rate at which production can develop in emergency. It will be the duty of the new Ministers Production Committee,assisted by the Joint War Production Staff, to study all and especially the wider aspects of our war potential, and for this purpose these bodies willbe regarded as sub-committees of the Defence Committee. The Presidentof the Board of Trade, the Minister of Labour, and such other authorities as may be required will be co-opted to the Ministerial Committeeto assist in the work. A permanent Chairman of the Joint War production staff will be appointed to the staff of the Minister of Defence.45. Administrative Questions of Common Interest to the three services. Within the resources allotted to them, the Service Ministers willcontinue to be responsible to Parliament for the maintenance and administra-tion of their own Services. The appointment of the Minister of defence will afford an opportunity to build up, for the handling of administrativequestions which are of common interest to the three Services, machineryindependent of the Chiefs of Staff organisation which will give full scope for collaboration by the Service Ministers and the administrative branches oftheir departments. The Minister of Defence will establish a StandingCommittee of the three Service Ministers meeting under his Chairmanship.This will be served by inter-Service Consultative Committees of PrincipalPersonnel Officers and Principal Supply Officers, which will also be linked up in operational matters to the Chiefs of Staff Committee. The minister will thus discharge his functions in relation to the Services, not by settingup a large staff of his own, but by making full use of the staffs of the service ministries on the proved Joint Staff system.46. Administration of Inter-Service Organisations. This functioninvolves direct administrative responsibility. An enquiry is now proceeding as a result of which certain administrative services may be drawn together and formed into a combined organisation serving all three branches of the armed forces. If this occurs, &quot;the resulting common services will be placeddirectly under the Minister of Defence, and will be administered by him.47. Relations of the Minister of Defence with the Chiefs of Staff. TheChiefs of Staff organisation has been highly developed during the war andits value has been fully proved.   No change is therefore contemplated in the
organisation of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, which will continue as atpresent, together with their Joint Staffs for strategical planning, intelligence,and administrative planning. The Chiefs of Staff Committee will retain their responsibility for preparing strategic military plans and submittingthem to the Defence Committee. On all technical questions of strategy and plans it is essential that the Cabinet and Defence Committee should beable to have presented to them directly and personally the advice of theChiefs of Staff, as the professional military advisers of the Government.Their advice to the Defence Committee or the Cabinet will not, therefore, be presented only through the Minister of Defence. At the same time, theorganisation on which they rely in their collective capacity will be located in the new Ministry, and the Chiefs of Staff will meet under the chairmanship of the new Minister whenever he or they may so desire. Thus, it will be after such consultation with them that he will formulate his proposals forthe apportionment of resources between the three Services. Before any major strategical plan is submitted to the Defence Committee, he willusually discuss it with the Chiefs of Staff, though not with a view to acting as their mouthpiece in the Defence Committee.48. Organisation for Formulation of Policy for Research and Develop-ment. The problem here is to secure the continued, and complete integration of military and scientific thought at all levels and to see that, in planningDefence Research as a whole, account is taken of the scientific effort of thecountry in other fields in order that our resources may be efficiently and economically used. For this purpose a Committee on Defence ResearchPolicy, consisting of those responsible, both from the operational and scientific angle, for research and development in the Service departments and the Ministry of Supply, has been set up to advise, on operationalquestions, the Chiefs of Staff and, on wider aspects, the Defence Committee.The Chairman of this body is a scientist of high standing, appointed for thepurpose for a period of years. On the establishment of the Ministry ofDefence, he will be a member (probably part-time) of its staff, and will exercise his functions under the authority of the Minister, with whom will rest, as stated in paragraph 42, responsibility for the framing of generalpolicy to govern research and development49. Home Security. In any future war the problems of home securitywill assume an importance even greater than that which they had in thelate war. It is essential that in military preparations full weight shouldbe given to the probable demands of the home security services, andwe have considered the desirability of extending the functions of theMinister of Defence to cover this field. We concluded, however, thatit would be wrong to do this. Home security embraces a large numberof activities apart from the air raid precautions and fire services, suchas the maintenance of food supplies for the civil population, transport,hospitals, and so on, which fall within the province of the civilMinistries, and to give the Minister of Defence charge of all this wouldbe to give him functions far outside his intended scope. It will be the dutyof the Defence Committee to link home security problems to broad defence policy, and a Home Defence Committee has already been reconstituted forthe purpose.50. Ministry of Defence. Examination of the functions to be carriedout by the Minister of Defence shows that it wili not be possible for himto operate through a small Secretariat. If only on account of the directadministrative responsibilites that he will assume, it will be necessary for him to have a Ministry with a separate Vote, and as his principal advisersa Permanent Secretary and a Chief Staff Officer. The rest of his staff will,be of two kinds. On the one hand, he will need a small secretarial and advisory staff, partly civil and partly military, which will providethe Secretariat of the Committees and Joint Staffs through which he willwork. On the other hand, he will need sufficient administrative staff toenable him to deal with the inter-Service organisations committed to hischarge. The civil members of his staff will be drawn from the Civil service in the normal way. The military members will be seconded from the three services in the same manner as are the military officers of the cabinet secretariat.IV.-ORGANISATION FOR COLLECTIVE DEFENCE.51. Through the central machinery described in Part III of this paper the Government will discharge its responsibility for organising the defenceof the United Kingdom. Our defence problems cannot, however, be viewedin isolation. We must be ready to play our part in any measures of collective defence which may be organised under the regis of the united nations; and we must maintain and develop our machinery for collaboration in the defence of the British Commonwealth and Empire.
52. Commonwealth Collaboration. Methods of collaboration betweenthe different parts of the Commonwealth are governed by the principleenunciated in the Statute of Westminster. Even before 1923, the conception that there should be a central authority in London, representativeof all the self-governing members of the Commonwealth, to reviewdefence questions and prepare central plans which would be binding onthe whole Commonwealth and Empire, was never recognised as practicableeven if it were desirable. Admittedly the Dominions have a closeinterest in problems that affect the Commonwealth and Enquire as awhole, but each of them has a special and distinct outlook on world affairs,dependent on its geographical position and its political and economicenvironment, and Dominion Governments must retain full liberty of action.Co-operation in Commonwealth Defence has therefore always taken thejoractical form of uniformity of organisation, training, and equipment ofmilitary forces, of the closest possible touch between Staffs, and the inter-change of officers to promote a common doctrine and outlook in militaryaffairs. Collaboration between the naval, land, and air forces from different parts of the Commonwealth and Empire in war-time has thus been easyand effective.58. Since .1923, the natural tendency of the different parts of theCommonwealth to view problems from their own individual standpoint liasbecome more marked. During the recent war, no attempt was made to revive the Imperial War Cabinet of 1917-18, but this did not prevent themaintenance of a very close touch between the Governments of theCommonwealth, not only by telegraphic means but by constant meetings between Ministers, officers, and officials on all levels. In this way, itwas possible to make common plans for military action, for the co-ordinationof munitions production, and for the co-operation of scientists and techniciansin research and development. This flexible system of handling problemsof mutual concern has proved very effective, and it was the object of studyat the, discussions in London in the spring of 1946. The attitude of theassembled representatives of the Governments of the Commonwealth is illustrated in the following extract from the. communique issued at theconclusion of those discussions:  &apos;* At the conclusion of the meetings the assembled representativesof the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and SouthAfrica place on record their appreciation of the value of this series of consultations, which exemplify the system of free discussion and exchange of view that characterises the relations of the countries of theBritish Commonwealth.The existing methods of consultation have proved their worth.They include a continuous exchange of information and commentbetween the different members of the Comonwealth. They are flexible and can be used to meet a variety of situations and needs, both those where the responsibility is on one member alone and where theresponsibility may have to be shared.&quot; They are peculiarly appropriate to the character of the BritishCommonwealth, with its independent members, who have shown by theirsacrifices in the common cause their devotion to kindred ideals and theircommunity of outlook. While all are willing to consider and adoptpractical proposals for developing the existing system, it is agreed thatthe methods now practised are preferable to any rigid centralisedmachinery. In their view such centralised machinery would not facilitate,and might even hamper, the combination of autonomy and unity whichis characteristic of the British Commonwealth and is one of their greatachievements.&quot;54. The natural starting-point for future progress in Commonwealthdefence has been the idea of regional association. Geography largely decideswhich problems most directly concern the separate members of the Common-wealth, and it is the aim of the various Governments to recognise and takeadvantage of this fact by arranging that regional questions shall in the firstplace be studied in the appropriate regional centre. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom have proposed that there should be established in the capital of each of the Dominions United Kingdom liaison officers whoeould join with the Dominion Chiefs of Staff in studying regional securityproblems. Similarly they have proposed that Dominion Governments should appoint liaison officers in London. It has been suggested that by this meansregional studies can be directed by the Government most immediately concerned with the help of a team of joint advisers. The fruits of these studies can be made available in London, and in the other Dominion capitals,and in this way that measure of co-ordination which is necessary can besecured. The exact method of organising the interchange of Missions will depend upon the varying constitutional practice in the different parts ofthe Commonwealth.55. These proposals received a favourable hearing, and His Mnjesty&apos;governments in the Dominions are studying them in detail.  There is reason
to suppose that in the main they will prove acceptable, and that they willpave the way for machinery which, while giving full play to the independence of the member States of the Commonwealth, will be effective as a means of consultation and collaboration.This regional method of organisation will also fit well into any regionalschemes evolved under the aegis of the United Nations, in which other states will join with members of the Commonwealth in appropriate geographical areas.56. Colonial Defence. For the defence of the Colonial Empire HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is directly responsible.The two main objects to be achieved in this field are first the securityof the Colonies themselves from external attack, and secondly thedevelopment of the full resources of the Colonies in the event of war.The security of the Colonies rests mainly upon the maintenance bythe Imperial forces of command of the sea and air approaches andof the freedom of the lines of communication between the different parts of the Empire, the forces of the Colonies having only the initial duty of withstanding local attacks until such time as reinforce-ments arrive. Plans and preparations for Colonial Defence thus fall (apartfrom any arrangements for Regional Defence which may be made withthe Dominions) within the general scope of measures for which the UnitedKingdom Government is primarily responsible. It is proposed to revive the overseas Defence Committee as a sub-committee of the Defence Committeein London, and this body will be charged, as it was before the war, withsurveying the whole field of defence preparations in the Colonies, and theircorrelation with the general picture of Imperial Defence. It will also bethe duty of this Committee to make sure that full account is taken in imperial plans of the contribution in men, materials, and facilities which each Colony is capable of making to the general pool in time of war.V.-CONCLUSION.57. Such, in outline, is the central defence organisation which werecommend. The changes proposed are based on the experience of thelast decade, and are designed to place on a secure foundation, and carryforward into peace, the machinery for inter-Service co-operation whichworked so smoothly and effectively in war. We are satisfied that thefunctions of the various parts have been defined with sufficient precisionto enable the duties to be carried out effectively, while at the same timethe organisation as a whole remains sufficiently flexible to allow the processof evolution to continue, as it has throughout this century, so that thecentral machinery for defence may be progressively adapted to changingneeds.

CENTRAL organisation for DEFENCEPresented by the Prime Minister to parliament by Command of His Majesty.1946.-   LONDONHIS MAJESTY&apos;S STATIONERY office net cmd.
CENTRAL ORGANISATION FOR defence i. introduction. In the White Paper on Defence (Cmd. 6743) which was presented toParliament in February 1946, His Majesty&apos;s Government announced their intention of putting forward at an early date their proposals for a central organisation for defence which would embody the improvements suggestedby the experience of the last six years. The enquiry which was thenproceeding has now been completed, and the changes which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment propose to make in the existing organisation are explained \Athis paper. &quot;The main features of the new organisation proposed are summarised inparagraph 20, and explained in greater detail in the succeeding paragraphs.These proposals do not involve any drastic break with the past: they arerather designed to carry a stage further the process of steady evolutionthrough which our central organisation fcr defence has developed duringthe past forty years. His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore thought itconvenient to preface their new proposals with a short account of theexisting organisation and the stages by which it has been evolved during thetwentieth century.II. Historical Review2. The year 1904 marks the real beginnings of our central organisation for defence. The defects in our military machinery which were brought to light by the Boer War led to the appointment of Lord Eslier&apos;s War Office(Reconsfcitution) Committee, - which in its first Report dated January 1904made the following statement:  &quot; The British Empire is pre-eminently a great naval, Indian, and colonial Power. There are nevertheless no means for co-ordinatingdefence problems, for dealing with them as a whole, for defining theproper functions of the various elements, and for ensuring that, on theone hand, peace preparations are carried out upon a consistent plan, and,on the other hand, that in time of emergency a definite war policy,based upon solid data, can be formulated.&quot;The remedy proposed and adopted was the establishment of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, which came into existence under a Treasury Minutedated *the 4th May, 1904.3. The founders of the Committee of Imperial Defence were concerned to design a mechanism which would not run counter to current conceptionsof Cabinet government, and would not interfere with the collective and individual responsibility of Ministers to Parliament. The Committee ofImperial Defence was therefore established as an advisory body; but in orderthat its recommendations should carry clue weight the Prime Minister wasmade the Chairman and only permanent member. He was given absolutediscretion in the selection of persons, whether Ministers, officials or experts,to attend its meetings. This arrangement secured to the new body bothauthority and flexibility. A small permanent Secretariat was established to arrange the business and. keep the records of the Committee and thus to provide continuity in its proceedings.4. In the decade before the war of 1914-18 the Committee of ImperialDefence was engaged in formulating the principles to govern our defence policy and in planning the transiton from peace to war.   These tasks were
accomplished with success; and at the outbreak of war in 1914-we had2 2 0well-laid plans for the transition from peace to war and better machinerythan we had ever had before for conceiting the actions of GovernmentDepartments in war. The Committee of Imperial Defence was not, however,designed to take executive control in war, nor had it developed any central machinery for inter-Service planning. The first of these defects wasremedied by the establishment of the War Cabinet at the end of 1916.But no machinery for inter-Service pfenning was created during that war :each Service remained separately responsible for the planning and conductof its operations, without any central co-ordination.5. The need for inter-Service planning was emphasised by the adventf*f a third Fighting Service, the Royal Air Force. Special attention was drawn to this in the Report (Cmd. 2029) of the Salisbury Committee on.National and Imperial Defence in 1923; and in 1924 the Chiefs of staff committee was established and the foundations of the Joint Staffs systemwere laid. This organisation was developed under the Chiefs of staff committee in the years between 1924 and 1939.6. The outbreak of the war in 1939 found us with plans fully preparedboth for the transition from peace to war and for the setting up ofmachinery for the conduct of war. A War Cabinet was immediatelyestablished; which worked with the assistance of the Chiefs of Staff Com-mittee and other Committees taken over from the Committee of ImperialDefence. The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, who had beenappointed in 1936 to assist the Prime Minister in the task of overseeing the rearmament programme, at first remained in office as a member of the WarCabinet, but his position was anomalous. He could not control the mobilisation and direction of the whole resources of the nation for totalwar, a task which of necessity falls to the Prime Minister, nor had he any specific responsibility for knitting together the actions of the three Services.The post was abolished in April 1940.7. - When Mr, Churchill became Prime Minister he assumed theadditional title of Minister of Defence. A Defence Committee (Operations)was set up, which for the greater part of the war consisted of the Prime-Minister and Minister of Defence (in the Chair), the Deputy Prime Minister,the Foreign. Secretary, the Minister of Production, the Service Ministers andthe Chiefs of Staff, other Ministers attending when matters affecting their departmental responsibilities were under consideration. This Committeeexamined the military plans prepared by the Chiefs of Staff and the JointStaffs and took decisions on behalf of the War Cabinet. A parallel body,the Defence Committee (Supply), dealt with the main lines of the production programmes. The duties of the Prime Minister as Minister of Defence werenever defined. It was left for Mr. Churchill to develop a method of working,through the Defence Committee and the Chiefs of Staff Committee,which enabled him to jmovide the drive without which successful warlikeoperations cannot be conducted.8. In the course of this development certain changes affecting theposition of the Service Departments gradually took place. The service ministers continued to be associated with the operational conduct of thewar through their membership of the Defence Committee; but the Chiefs ofStaff in their corporate capacity became the authority which issued toComniahders-in-Chief unified operational instructions and strategicalguidance on the conduct of the war. The responsibility for the day-to-day administration of the Services remained with the Service Departments, whofollowed up the central directives issued by the Chiefs of Staff with detailed[32361] o*
instructions to their, own Commanders-in-Chief on such matters as the.composition, equipment and movement of the forces under their command and the provision of reinforcements and supplies. The corporate authorityof the Chiefs of Staff in the higher direction of the war, under the immediatesupervision of the Prime Minister, was further consolidated, after the entry of the United States into the war, by the institution of the Combined Chiefsof Staff in Washington, by the appointment of Anglo-American SupremeCommanders and by the close relations which developed between thePresident of the United States and the Prime Minister of the UnitedKingdom.9. No Ministry of Defence was created during the war. The Ministerof Defence operated by bringing together from the Service department and elsewhere those Ministers or officials who would be responsible for theexecution of plans when approved. He used as his staff the small MilitarySecretariat of the War Cabinet, which had previously served the Committeeof Imperial Defence. The military head of the Secretariat became his chiefStaff Officer and a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. The task ofthe Secretariat was to draft reports and telegrams on behalf of the Chiefsof Staff, to ensure co-ordination and continuity in the activities of the variouscommittees and sub-committees dealing with military questions, and generally to facilitate the smooth running of the inter-Service machine. Itwas not their duty to act as military advisers to the Minister of Defence. Itwas their duty to procure for him advice from those who would beresponsible for action.10. This account of developments during the late war would be incom-plete without a reference to.the great progress made in the direct associationof scientists with the work of the Service Departments and otherDepartments. It is not possible to give in this paper a full description ofthis association. It is enough to say that in the design and developmentof weapons and equipment, in the study of tactical methods, and in fore-seeing and counteracting the enemy&apos;s technical progress, scientists playedan invaluable part. It was made clear during the war that any futured development of our central organisation for defence would be incompleteif it did not provide throughout for the closest possible integration of scientific and military men.Ill. Commentary11. This short sketch of the development of our central war machineshows that in those aspects of defence preparation which require collabora-tion between the military and civil agencies of government we were fullyprepared both in 1914 and in 1939. This part of the work of the Committeeof Imperial Defence had been well done, and the transition from peace towar was smoothly made.12. In many respects, however, we were dangerously unprepared for jwar. Qualitatively our Navy and Air Force were not badly equipped, butthere were serious gaps. We were dangerously short of destroyers andother escort vessels. We were inadequately supplied with aircraft and 1anti-aircraft artillery. Our Army was so small, and so badly equipped, 1and had so little munitions production behind it, that if the fighting on!the Continent in 1940 had been prolonged we should soon have been short jof every kind of ammunition.13.   This failure to equip our forces on an adequate scale was mainly 3due to the political and economic circumstances of the decade before 1939,which had the result of postponing until far too late the start of an
effective   programme   of  re-armament.   With   these   considerations   thifcpaper is not concerned.   There was, however, one defect of organisation which contributed to the unpreparedness of the Services, viz., the absence from the machinery of the Committee of Imperial Defence of a guidinghand to formulate a unified defence policy for the three Services.   For lackof such a unifying influence separate aspects of our defences tended to be\ examined one by one.    Thus,  the Admiralty  building programme,  the; strength of the Metropolitan Air Force, the number of guns and search-j lights to be deployed in the Air Defence of Great Britain, the equipmentI of the Field Force each of these subjects came up for review separately.I The only conspectus of our armed forces and their requirements was thatjvhieh was compiled for financial purposes by adding the separate com-yonents together.   The central organisation failed to secure that broad butthorough examination of Service programmes which alone could ensurethat, if war came, we should be reacty in all important respects to meet it.14. This weakness was not remedied by the appointment of a minister for   Co-ordination   of   Defence.     His   duties   were   strictly   limited   toco-ordinating, and he had no power to take executive action. He was not: given responsibility to Parliament, nor did he have any jurisdiction over the apportionment of the available resources between the three Services.15.   During the war a unified defence policy was  achieved by theI assumption of executive control by the Prime Minister and Minister ofDefence.   How is it to be achieved in peace?One method would be to amalgamate the three Services completely, andto place them under a single Minister of the Crown. This has been advocates-cated by some as the logical development of the close relation which hasbeen built up during the war between the oj^eration of forces by sea, land,and air and as a means of giving full play to scientific development inI weapons. His Majesty&apos;s Government do not reject the conception as some-thing which might be found desirable at some stage in the future. They; have decided, however, that amalgamation is a step which could not andshould not be taken here and now.16. Another method which has been suggested from time to time is theI creation of a &quot; Combined General Staff.&quot; Critics of our organisation havecontended that the Chiefs of Staff Committee, and the Joint Staffs for planning, Intelligence, and Administrative Planning which work for it, donot form a combined General Staff in the sense of an impartial central organisation which plans operations without regard for Service prejudice orsectional interests. Our own exjoerience, and a close study of capturedGerman archives showing the working .of the German Oberkommando derI Wehrmacht (O.K.W.), combine to demonstrate that this conception is notonly inferior to our Joint Staff system, but has defects which in practiceproved&apos; disastrous. The German system failed because the Planning staffs of the O.K.W. were not drawn from the headquarters of the three Services.The plans they produced had later to be handed to those headquarters for\ execution, and were often found to be unrealisitic. The cleavage betweenplanning and execution set up dangerous antagonisms, and entirely nullifiedany theoretical advantages of the German system.17. It has always been a cardinal principle of the British organisation that, alike in the Chiefs of Staff Committee and in the Joint Staff, it shouldbe the men responsible in the Service Departments for carrying out the approved policy who are brought together in the central machine to formulate it. The soundness of this principle has been amply proved in practical   experience  in   war.    The   methods   employed  in  the   British
organisation were adopted without alteration in the machinery of the combined Chiefs of Staff, and at the various Anglo-American headquartersformed in the held.18. It has sometimes been suggested that, even though our Joint Staffsystem is based on sound principles, it would be improved by the appoint-ment of an independent Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, either a civilian of wide experience and proved ability or an ex-Chief of Staff.This suggestion ignores the facts as they exist, and as they have existed for many years. It has always been recognised that, whenever he seesfit, the Prime Minister can himself preside at meetings of the Chiefs ofStaff Committee. Before the war, the Minister for Co-ordination of defence was also empowered to assemble the Committee and to take the Chajjhimself. During the war, there were many occasions on which the PrimeMinister in his capacity as Minister of Defence did preside over the Chiefsof Staff Committee, and at all times he took a most active part in directinathe work of the Committee in accordance with the demands of the generalsituation. By this means the Prime Minister was able to place ideas beforethe Chiefs of Staff for professional examination, to keep them in touchwith political matters which had military implications, and thus to directin a broad way the work of the whole Joint Staff. The Prime Minister didnot, however, act as the mouthpiece of the Chiefs of Staff before the cabinet and Defence Committee.IY. Proposals19. Outline of Neiv Organisation Proposed. After reviewing thedevelopment of our defence organisation over the last forty years and its practical performance under the test of two major wars, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are satisfied that there are no grounds for any drastic re-castingof the main structure of the organisation as it exists to-day. Some changes are, however, required in order to consolidate the advances which havebeen made in the last ten years under the compulsion of war or of the threat of war. Above all, experience during these years has shown theneed of a Minister who has both the time and the authority to formulateand apply a unified defence policy for the three Services; and it is proposedthat this need should be met by the creation of a Minister of Defence.20. The form of the new organisation proposed may be summarisedas follows:  (a) The Prime Minister will retain the supreme responsibility for defence.(5) The Defence Committee, under the Chairmanship of the PrimeMinister, will take over the functions of the old Committee ofImperial Defence, and will be responsible both for the review of current strategy and for co-ordinating departmental action in preparation for war.(c) A new post of Minister of Defence, with a Ministry, will be created.The Minister of Defence will be responsible to Parliament forcertain subjects, which are defined in paragraph 26 below, affectingthe three Services and their supply. In addition, he will be deputy chairman of the Defence Committee; and he will also take the chair at the Chiefs nf Staff Committee whenever he or the Chiefsof Staff so desire.(d) The Chiefs of Staff Committee will remain responsible for preparingstrategic appreciations and military plans, and for submittingthem to the Defence Committee; and the Joint Staff system willbe retained and developed under their direction.
(c) The Service Ministers will continue to be responsible to parliament for the administration of their Services in accordance, with thegeneral policy approved by the Cabinet and within the resourcesallotted to them.The above summary is elaborated in the following paragraphs.21. The Defence Committee. The appointment of a Minister ofDefence will relieve the Prime Minister of that part of his general responsi-bility for national defence which is concerned with the inter-relation of thethree fighting Services and their supply. There remains, however, theorganisation for national defence in its broader aspect, including both currentCuestions of high policy in the sphere of defence, and also the preparationJ plans over the whole field of Government activity, both civil and military,for mobilising the entire resources of the nation .in a major war. these problems engage the collective responsibility of the Government as a whole.They must, therefore, be handled under the authority of the Cabinet itself.22. It is proposed that there should be a Defence Committee to dealwith these problems, under the Cabinet. It will be responsible both forthe review of current strategy and also for the preparation of plans forthe country&apos;s transition from peace to war, and will thus discharge the taskscarded out before the war by the Committee of Imperial Defence.28. The Prime Minister will be Chairman of the Defence Committee.Its composition will be flexible. The Prime Minister, Minister of Defence,Lord President of the Council, Foreign Secretary, Chancellor of theExchequer, the Service Ministers and the Minister of Supply will be regularmembers of the Committee, and the Chiefs of Staff will be in attendance.Such other Ministers, officers and officials as may be required will be invitedto attend meetings of the Committee, according to the subjects underdiscussion.24. The preparation of plans for mobilising the nation&apos;s resources inwar will, as stated above, involve the collaboration of almost all governmentagencies, both civil and military. This task will be undertaken by a systemof Sub-Committees working under the general direction and authority ofthe Defence Committee. These Sub-Committees will be constituted mainlyat the official level, as were the Sub-Committees of the Committee ofImperial Defence before the war, and will include representatives of theServices, Service Departments, and Civil Departments, and, where necessary, persons outside government service altogether.25. The Prime Minister must be Chairman of the Defence Committee,by virtue of his ultimate responsibility for national defence. When inter-national relations are stable, however, it will be neither possible nor necessaryfor him to attend all the meetings of the Committee; and it is desirablethat he should have as Deputy Chairman a senior Minister who can relievehim of as much as possible of the detailed work of supervising the prepara-tion of our defence plans. The Minister of Defence will assume this responsibility. In this capacity he will be able to exercise a general super-vision over the preparations which are being made for national defence as a whole through the various Sub-Committees of the Defence Committee.26. Functions of the Minister of Defence. The,functions of the Ministerof Defence will be defined as follows:  -(a) The apportionment, in broad outline, of available resources betweenthe three Services in accordance with the strategic policy laid downby the Defence Committee.    This will include the framing ol
general policy to govern research and development, and the correla-tion of production programmes.(6) The settlement of questions of general administration on which acommon policy for the three Services is desirable,(c) The administration of inter-Service organisations, such as combined operations Headquarters and the Joint Intelligence Bureau.The Minister will bring his proposals under (a) before the DefenceCommittee and the Cabinet. He will present the CabineCs decisions onthese to Parliament, and will decide questions arising between the three services in their application. Pie will not be responsible for the subsequentdetailed execution of the approved programmes, which will be the task ofthe Service and Supply Ministers. As a consequence of (b), he will answquestions in Parliament on matters common to the three Services or to thethree Services and the Ministry of Supply. The machinery through whichthe Minister will discharge his responsibilities is described below.27. The Apportionment of Resources. The new organisation must be such as to ensure that the resources available for defence are laid out tothe best advantage in terms of manpower, weapons and equpipment, works services, amenities, &amp;c. A beginning was made this year with a new&apos; procedure for determining Service Estimates in total, wdiich it is proposedto develop so as to enable provision for Defence to be dealt with as a singleproblem in the light of the economic position and strategic; requirements ofthe country. The Chiefs of Staff will advise the Defence Committee on our strategic requirements from year to year. It will then be for the service departments to translate these requirements into terms of men, money and supplies, and for the Minister of Defence to present the co-ordinated result to the Defence Committee in the form of a coherent scheme&apos;of expenditure which will give the country forces and equipment in properly balancedproportions. On production questions there will be a Standing MinisterialProduction Committee consisting of the Service Ministers and the Ministerof Supply, over which the Minister of Defence will preside. Working forthis Committee there will be a Joint War Production Staff composed of serving officers and civil representatives of the Service and Supply Depart-ments, the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Labour. With the help of this organisation, and of the Committee of Service Ministers referred toin paragraph 29 below, the Minister of Defence will be able to frame coni-prehensive defence proposals in the form of a consolidated estimate for presentation to the Defence Committee and the Cabinet.28. Peace-time production programmes cannot be determined without regard to questions of war potential. The size of peace-time stocks of equipment must be related to the rate at which production can develop in emergency. It will be the duty of the new Minister&apos;s Production Committee,assisted by the Joint War Production Staff, to study all and especially the wider aspects of our war potential, and for this purpose these bodies willbe regarded as sub-comnuttees&apos;of the Defence Committee. The Presidentof the Board of Trade, the Minister of Labour, and such other authorities as may be required will be co-opted to the Ministerial Committeeto assist in the work. A permanent Chairman of the Joint War production staff will be appointed to the staff of the Minister of Defence.29. Administrative Questions of Common Interest to the Three,Services. Within the resources allotted to them, the Service Ministers willcontinue to be responsible to Parliament for the maintenance and administrn-tion of their own Services. The appointment of the Minister of defence will afford an opportunity to build up, for the handling of administrative
questions which are of common interest to the three Services, machineryindependent of the Chiefs of Staff organisation which will give full scope for collaboration by the Service Ministers and the administrative branches oftheir departments. The Minister of Defence will establish a StandingCommittee&quot; of the three Service Ministers meeting under his Chairmanship.This will be served by inter-Service Consultative Committees of PrincipalPersonnel Officers and Principal Supply Officers, which will also be linked up in operational matters to the Chiefs of Staff Committee. The minister will thus discharge his functions in relation to the Services, not by settingup a large staff of his own, but by making full use of the staffs of the service ministries on the proved Joint Staff system.A 80. Administration of Inter-Service Organisations. This functioninvolves direct administrative responsibility. [An enquiry is now proceeding as a result of which certain administrative services may be drawn together and formed into a combined organisation serving all three branches of the armed forces. If this occurs, the resulting common services will be placeddirectly under the Minister of Defence, and wall be administered by him.]31. Relations of the Minister of Defence with the Chiefs of Staff. TheChiefs of Staff organisation has been highly developed during the war andits value has been fully proved. No change is therefore contemplated in theorganisation of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, which will continue as atpresent, together with the Joint Staffs for strategical planning, intelligence,and administrative planning. The Chiefs of Staff Committee will retain their responsibility for preparing strategic military plans and submittingthem to the Defence Committee. On all technical questions of strategy and plans it is essential that the Cabinet and Defence Committee should beable to have presented to them directly and personally the advice of theChiefs of Staff, as the professional military advisers of the Government.Their advice to the Defence Committee or the Cabinet will not, therefore, be presented only through the Minister of Defence. At the same time, theorganisation on which they rely in their collective capacity will be located in the new Ministry, and the Chiefs of Staff will meet under the Chairman-ship of the new Minister whenever he or they may so desire. Thus, it wull be after such consultation with them that he will formulate his proposals forthe apportionment of resources between the three Services. Before any major strategical plan is submitted to the Defence Committee, he willusually discuss it with the Chiefs of Staff, though not with a view to acting as their mouthpiece in the Defence Committee.3*2. Organisation for Formulation of Policy for Research and Dcvelop-ment. The problem here is to secure the continued and complete integration of military and scientific thought at all levels and to see that, in planningDefence Research as a whole, account is taken of the scientific effort of thecountry in other.fields in order that our resources may be efficiently and economically used. For this purpose a Committee on Defence ResearchPolicy, consisting of those responsible, both from the operational andscentific angle, for research and development in the Service departments and the Ministry of Supply, has been set up to advise, on operationalquestions, the Chiefs of Staff and, on wider aspects, the Defence Committee.The Chairman of this body is a scientist of high standing, appointed for thepurpose for a period of years. On the establishment of the Ministry ofDefence, he will, be a member (probably part-time) of its staff, and. will exercise his functions under the authority of the Minister, with whom will rest, as stated in paragraph 26, responsibility for the framing of generalpolicy to govern research and development.
38.   Home Security. In any future war the problems of home security IwiJl assume an importance even greater than that which they had in the Ilate war.   It is essential that in military preparations full weight should Ibe given to the probable demands of the home security services, and His 1Majesty&apos;s Government have considered the desirability of extending the 1functions  of the  Minister of &apos; Defence  to cover this held.   They  have Iconcluded, however, that it would be wrong to do this.   Home security Iembraces a large number of activities apart from the air raid precautionsand fire services, such as the maintenance of food supplies for the civilpopulation, transport, hospitals, and so on, which fall within the province of the civil Ministries, and to give the Minister of Defence charge of all this would be to give him functions far outside his intended scope.   It willbe the duty of the Defence Committee to link home security problems Qbroad defence policy, and a Home Defence Committee has already beenreconstituted for the purpose.34.   Ministry of Defence. Examination of the functions to be carriedout by the Minister of Defence shows that it will not be possible for him to operate through a small. Secretariat.   If only on account of the directadministrative responsibilities that he will assume, it will be necessary for him to have a Ministry with a separate Vote, and as his principal advisersa Permanent Secretary and Chief Staff Officer.   The rest of his staff will beof two kinds.   On the one hand, he will need a small secretarial and advisorystaff, j^artly civil and partly military, which will provide the Secretariat of Ithe Committees and Joint Staffs through which he will work.   On the other Ihand, he will need sufficient administrative staff to enable him to deal with Ithe inter-Service organisations committed to his charge.   The civil members 1of his staff will be drawn from the Civil Service in the normal way.   The military members will be seconded from the three Services in the same Imanner as are the military officers of the Cabinet Secretariat.Y. Organisation for Collective Defence35. Through the central machinery described in Part IV of this paper IHis Majesty&apos;s Government will discharge their responsibility for organising 1the defence of the United Kingdom. Our defence problems cannot, however, Ibe viewed in isolation. We must be ready to play our part in any measures Iof collective defence which may be organised under the asgis of the United 1Nations; and we must maintain and develop our machinery for collaboration in the defence of the British Commonwealth and Empire.86.   Commonwealth Collaboration. Methods of collaboration between [the various members of the Commonwealth are governed by the principleenunciated in the Statute of Westminster.   Even before 1923, the conceptionthat there should be a central authority in London, representative of allthe  self-governing members  of  the   Commonwealth,  to   review  defence questions and prepare central plans which would be binding on the wholeCommonwealth and Empire, was never recognised as practicable even if jit were desirable.    Admittedly the Dominions have a close interest inproblems that affect the Commonwealth and Empire as a whole, but eacliof them has a special and distinct outlook On world affairs, dependent on Iits geographical position and its political and economic environment, and dominion Governments must retain full liberty of action..   Co-operation in Commonwealth Defence has therefore always taken the practical formof uniformity of organisation, training, and equipment of military forces,the closest, possible touch between Staffs, and the interchange of officers to promote a common doctrine and outlook in military affairs.   Collaboration
-    224between the naval, land, and air forces from different parts of the Common-wealth and Empire in war-time has thus been easy and effective.37. Since 1923, the natural tendency of the different parts of theCommonwealth to view problems from their own individual standpoint hasbecome more marked. During the recent war, no attempt was made to revive the Imperial War Cabinet of 1917-18, but this did not prevent themaintenance of a very close touch between the Governments of the Common-wealth, not only by telegraphic means but by constant meetings between ministers, officers and officials on all levels. In this way, it was possibleto make common plans for military action, for the co-ordination of munitions production, and for the co-operation of scientists and technicians in researchHind development. This flexible system of handling problems of mutualconcern has proved very effective, and it was the object of study at therecent discussions in London in the spring of 1946. The attitude of theassembled&apos; representatives of the Governments of the Commonwealth is illustrated in the following extract from the communique issued at theconclusion of those discussions:  &quot; At the conclusion of the meetings the assembled representativesof the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and SouthAfrica place on record their appreciation of the value of this series of consultations, which exemplify the system of free discussion and exchange of view that characterises the relations of the countries ofthe British Commonwealth.&quot; The existing methods of consultation have proved their worth.They include a continuous exchange of information and commentbetween the different members of the Commonwealth. They are flexible and can be used to meet a variety of situations and needs, both those where the responsibility is on one member alone and where theresponsibility may have to be shared.&quot; They are peculiarly appropriate to the character of the BritishCommonwealth, with its independent members, who have shown by theirsacrifices in the common cause their devotion to kindred ideals and theircommunity of outlook. While all are willing to consider and adoptpractical proposals, for developing the existing system, it is agreed thatthe methods now practised are preferable to any rigid centralisedmachinery. In their view such centralised machinery would not facilitate,and might even hamper, the combination of autonomy and unity whichis characteristic of the British Commonwealth and is one of their greatachievements.&apos;&apos;38. The natural starting-point for future progress in Commonwealthdefence has been the idea of regional association. Geography largely decideswhich problems most directly concern the separate members of the Common-wealth, and it is the aim of the various Governments to recognise and takeadvantage of this fact by arranging that regional questions shall in the firstplace be studied in the appropriate regional centre. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom have propcsed that there should be established in the capital of each of the Dominions United Kingdom liaison officers who could join with the Dominion Chiefs of Staff in studying regional securityproblems. Similarly they have proposed that Dominion Governments should appoint liaison officers in London. It has been suggested that by this meansregional studies can be directed by the Government most immediately concerned with the help of a team of joint advisers. The fruits of these studies can be made available in London, and in the other Dominion capitals,and in this way that measure of co-ordination which is necessary can be
secured. The exact method of organising the interchange of Missions will depend upon the varying constitutional practice in the different parts of theCommonwealth.39. These proposals received a favourable hearing at the discussions in London in the spring, and His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominionsare studying them in detail. There is reason to suppose that in the mainthey will prove acceptable, and that they will pave the way for machinery which, while giving full play to the independence of the Member States ofthe Commonwealth, will be effective as a means of consultation and collaboration.This regional method of organisation will also fit well into any regionaWschemes evolved under the aegis of the United Nations in which other Stateswwill join with members of the Commonwealth in appropriate geographical areas.40. Colonial Defence. For the defence of the Colonial Empire HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is directly responsible. Thetwo main objects to be achieved in this field are first the security of theColonies themselves from external attack, and secondly the development ofthe full resources of the Colonies in the event of war. The security of theColonies rests mainly upon the maintenance by the Imperial forces of command of the sea and air approaches and of the freedom of the lines ofcommunication between the different parts of the Empire, the forces of theColonies having only the initial duty of withstanding local attacks until such time as reinforcements arrive. Plans and preparations for Colonial Defencethus fall (apart from any arrangements for Regional Defence which maybe made with the Dominions) within the general scope of the defence measures for which the United. Kingdom Government is primarily responsible. It is proposed to revive the Overseas Defence Committee asa sub-committee of the Defence Committee in London, and this body willbe charged, as it was before the war, with surveying the whole field ofdefence preparations in the Colonies, and their correlation with the generalpicture of Imperial Defence. It will also be the duty of this Committee tomake sure that full account is taken in Imperial plans of the contribution in men, materials, and facilities which each Colony is capable of making to Ithe general pool in time of war.YI. Conclusion41. Such, in outline, is the higher defence organisation which His IMajesty&apos;s Government have decided to introduce. The changes proposed jare based on the experience of the last decade, and are designed to place Ion a secure foundation, and to carry forward into peace, the machinery for Iinter-Service co-operation which worked so smoothly and effectively in war. IThe Government are satisfied that the functions of the various parts have 8been defined with sufficient precision to enable the duties to be carried out Ieffectively, while at the same time the organisation as a whole remains Isufficiently flexible to allow the process of evolution to continue, as it has 9throughout this century, so that the central machinery for defence may be 9progressively adapted to changing needs.
