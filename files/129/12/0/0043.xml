In your Minute to me  (M. 305/46)  of the 12th September inregard to squatter a, you asked me to keep you. informed aboutd e velopment s.As you will know, a development has occurred in thatfive leaders of the Communist Party have been arrested andcharged with criminal conspiracy in connection with theorganisation of the squatting movement.      I learnt of this first when I saw it in Sunday&apos;s newspapers, but I assume thatyou will have been informed in advance of the contemplatedaction, as I find that the Director of Public Prosecutionsinformed the Home Office on Friday, and again on Saturdayof what was contemplated.In any event,  I gather from enquiries made this morningthat it must have been considered that the evidence disclosedsuch a clear breach of the criminal law that there was no occasion to justify any delay in putting the law intooperation.      The Director informs me that he considers thatthere  is&quot;a cast iron case&quot; against the five persons arrestedin respect of what occurred on Sunday, the 8th September.There was also some evidence that further seizures ofproperty were contemplated for yesterday, including, it isthought,  an attempted seizure of Kensington Palace.      TheDirector considers that the action taken by the police inarresting the five ring leaders may have had a depressing effect on those who were organising further activities.The cases will come up at Bow Street today, and will be handled in the ordinary course by Treasury Counsel,      Thecivil proceedings will be taken before the -Judge in Chamberstomorrow,  and there will probably be similar summonses beforethe Judge-  one by the Westminster City Council in a strong case with aggravated features, and one by the owners ofAbbey Lodge.      The learned judge (who may adjourn the hearinginto open Court) &quot;will be asked to grant an immediateinjunction to restrain the continuance of the trespasses.It is a matter for his discretion whether he grants such an injunction or not, and I can only say that, in my own view,he ought to do so.      I am proposing that the case should betaken by standing Counsel to the Ministry of Works, and thatI should not myself intervene unless we ascertain beforehandthat a Silk is likely to be employed on the other side.I am, however,  consulting with the representatives of theMinistry, the Treasury Solicitor and Counsel concerned asto the general line to be taken in the proceedings.(Intld. ) H.W.S.LAW OFFICERS&apos;  DEPARTMENT.16th September, 1946.THE PRIME MINISTER

I have had a long consultation this afternoon with theDirector of Public Prosecutions, the Commissioners of Police,Sir Frank Newsam, a representative of the Treasury Solicitor,and Junior Counsel to the Ministry of Works and the Ministryof Health, together with representatives of those Ministries.1.      I understand that the criminal proceedings for con-spiracy stand adjourned, the defendants having been releasedon bail.      You should,  I think, know that the defendants allappear to he people of good  character, and that Henderson,the Secretary of the Committee acting for the Squatters inthe Duchess of Bedford house, was himself a person living inthe most deplorable housing conditions.2.      The civil proceedings,  in which an injunction againstthe continuing- trespasses is claimed, will be heard tomorrow,but they will, of course, only be binding on the small numberof defendants who have actually been sued, and the possibilityarises that these defendants will obey such orders as theCourt may make, but will give place to other trespassers.      Inthese circumstances, the Departments desired to know whetherthey were entitled to resist entry by fresh trespassers,  orthe re-entry of oxis ting trespassers who have left thepremises for some^emporary purpose.      I was told / what I hadnot known before j/ that, in the case of the Governmentrequisitioned premises, Government caretakers still remain inoccupation.      In my opinion, if it is made clear by theDepartments or (in the case of non-requisitioned premises)by the owner, that they in no way consent to a continuance ofthese trespasses and will take all possible steps to put anend to them and to prevent further trespasses occurring, theyare entitled to resist any attempt to enter or re-enter thepremises, and if any such attempt is made, whether by force or a shov/ of force, or with the connivance of trespassersalready wrongfully in the premises, such attempt would constitute an offence under the Statutes against forcible entry.I think,  therefore, that the Police are entitled toprotect owners who, in the circumstances indicated, seek toprevent the commission of further trespasses, either by freshentry or by re-entry into the premises.      In order, however,that it should be made perfectly clear to the existingtrespassers that their occupation has not in any way beenlicensed  or acquiesced in,  I think the caretakers should take steps to inform them that they are regarded as trespassers,and that their conduct continues to expose them both, to therisk of actions for damages and to criminal proceedings.It is, of course, a question of policy how far re-entry into premises by people who have already squatted there,  e.g,,the re-entry of a father who has gone out to buy milk for thebaby, should be refused.      I earn only advise that there is, inmy opinion, legal power in the owner to resist such entry,which if attempted against such resistance, would constitute a fresh forcible entry, exposing the person attempting it toliability to arrest.THE PRIME MINISTER

3.      If I am wrong in thinking that the police are entitleclto assist and protect an owner who is seeking to prevent there-entry to his premises of somebody &quot;who has previouslytrespassed upon them, the only remedy which could be taken against the police would appear to be civil or criminal proceedings for assar.lt or, if the police made arrests, forwrongful arrests,      Even if such proceedings lay in law,  Ithink it unlikely that any Court would award more thannominal damages.      In any event, we should have to take thematter up to the highest Courts in order to seek to justifythe action of the police, and if the worst came to the worst,might have to have an act of indemnity.      But I do not myselfentertain any real doubt that the police are entitlecl tosupport owners of property in the circumstances indicated,and it would,  indeed, be an astonishing position if, althoughthe police were entitled to prevent a forcible entry throughthe front door of a man&apos;s house, they could not take similar action against a person who was attempting to get in, e.g.through an open window, with the connivance of somebodywho had already suceeded in getting a forcible entry.h.      It is possible that if injunctions are granted,  againstthe existing defendants, they may leave the- premises in whichthey are trespassing and simply squat on the pavements and say that they are without any place to which to go.      Thepolice understand that it is the fact that some of them willbe in this position.      The Public Assistance Authoritiesshould, I think, be prepared to provide them with shelter,  asit is their obligation to do, in some public assistanceinstitution or rest shelter, and the police should &quot;be informedwhether such shelter is available, in order that they mayadvise the people concerned to avail themselves of it.      If,after being advised that temporary shelter is available tothem, they continue to squat on the pavements, the police would be able to deal with them for obstruction,5.      If the proceedings against the existing defendants are concluded by the granting of the Injunctions sought,  i suggest that a notice .should be served on all othertrespassers who continue in their illegal occupation, drawingtheir attention to the result of the test cases, and statingthat, the illegality of their action having been established,if they have not vacated the premises within a specified period of time,  the Government will have to resort to other measures against them in order to secure compliance with thelaw.      It will then be for consideration whether legal proceedings should be taken against all the remainingindividuals, or whether an attempt should be made to ejectthe trespassers by force.      In view of the fact thatcaretakers remain in occupation of the premises concerned,there would,  I think, not be the same possible legalobjection that I had at first anticipated, but it will, ofcourse, be appreciated that the forcible ejection of all thetrespassers would be a very formidable undertaking, and theremay be reasons of policy which make it preferable to proceed by way of legal proceedings against the individuals concerned.On the other hand,  it is obviously important to get thematter finally disposed of as quickly as possible.6.      The Police consider that there was - at any rate untilthe arrests made by them on Saturday - some danger of themovement spreading, both, in London and in the provinces.      Ihave asked to be kept informed of all developments, and  I willat once pass on any information -which it appears desirable foryou to have,(Intld)    H.W.S.LAW OFFICERS&apos;  PEP&apos;,PTIbibFT ,16th September, 19kb-
