(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (46)  5219TH AUGUST,   1946CABINETTHE RE 0 RG AN IS AT 10 N OF BROADCASTING- services the WEST OF ENGLAND REGIONJoint Memorandum &quot;by the Lord President of - the Counciland the postmaster-General &quot;1.      Our colleagues will romember that  on the 1st April,  1946(CM. (46) 29th Conclusions, Minute 9)  the Cabinet decided that,as part of the re-organisation of the B.B.C.  home servicesconsequent upon the.introduction of the new Third programme,the Midland and West of England regions should be merged intoa new Southern region.     This decision was forced upon us by theshortage of wavelengths and the need to allocate at least two ofour medium wavelengths to the European Services.      Itsannouncement in the White Paper on broadcasting policy has caused widespread dismay in the West Country.    Protests againstthe disappearance of the West of England region have been receivedfrom a largo number of local Government authorities in the region,  and,  in reply to a deputation of Labour M.P. s, we have undertaken to consider every possible means of maintaining the region&apos;s separate identity.The Effects of Merging the West of England, and Midland Regions3.      It has always been realised, that the proposed mergerwas the most unsatisfactory feature of the whole ro-organisationscheme, and that it could only be defended on the ground that,given the shortage of wavelengths,  no other arrangement couldbe devised that would not injure many more listeners.    It mightbe well,  however,   to recapitulate the effects of there organisation in the west Country and the Midlands.(a) The- west Country will lose  its own regional home service,   to which it has clearly become greatlyat attached.(b) Approximately 225,000 people in Devon, Cornwall andWiltshire will receive no Home Service programme atall,  while a further 350,000 in the West  of England   &apos; .region will have to take their home service fromIWales or London (at present 2,540,000 people  out ofa total regional population of 2,700,000 receivethe west  of England programme).COPY NO.&apos; (Ti o

(c) In the present Midland. Region nearly 3,000,000 peopleoat of a total population of 6,029,000 will,   be deprived of their own regional programme.    OverI2 millions of thorn in a wide stretch of territory extending from Northern Shropshireeastwards thorough Staffordshire,  Derby,Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire and including such important towns as Derby, Nottingham and at  oho-on-Trent will have to take the Northernprogramme, while the rest of Leicestershire andthe whole  of Nofthants will go over to the Londonregion,  and: a thinly populated area in Shropshireand Hereford will have to take the Welsh programme.(d) on the opposite side of the account it may be pointedout that the whole of the Midland region and , , .2,000,000 out of the 2,700,000 inhabitants of theWest of England, region will receive the newThird Pr0grammo.Public Reactions to the Merger3.      We nave been deeply impressed, with the strength of feeling against the merger already manifested, in the westCountry.      The deputation of Labour M.P.s informed us,   infact,  that they found, the public more disturbed, about  this step than bread rationing or any of the other questions ofthe day.      wo believe,  however,   that the present volume of complaint  is- small compared, to the  outcry with which theGovernment may be faced when the individual listener in theWest of England and in the North Midlands has actuallyexperienced the effects of the reorganisation.    There is a danger of very serious trouble  in the autumn unlesssomething can be done to improve the position.The possibility of Saving the west of England Region4,      This can only be done by reorganising the wavelengthsat our disposal.    A committee of officials have examined thepossibilities in conjunction with the B.3.C. ,  and. havesuggested that consideration should be given to the transferof the German wavelength at present being used forentertainment programmes for the troops of the B.A. O.R.to the B.B.0, European service in order to release one of theBritish medium wavelengths now in use by this service for theWest of England region.So      Such a iv.-organisation would not only reprieve the west of England region but would, enable the Midland region toretain its present audience.    It ought not, however,  to beadopted without a full appreciation of the other factors whichare involved.

The Heeds of the E. A. Q,R.6.      In the first place, the Army authorities rightly attach the greatest importance to giving troops of the Army ofOocupation a satisfactory reception of a British entertain-men t programme.    The morale of our troops in Germany must clearly remain a matter of great concern to the Government,and up-^to-date no satisfactory means has been found ofgiving to the many and widely scattered units in the british zone, satisfactory wireless entertainment save by the use ofthe powerful Norden transmitter working from within Germany.A number of other means of serving the B. A. 0, R,  have beensuggested to us and are at present being investigatedurgently by the lost Office ana Army authorities, andsomething might be done to improve the quality of the troops&apos;receivers so that they can listen without difficulty to theB.B. C Light Programme.    But it must be recognised that inall probability the loss of Norden will cause&apos;a gravedeterioration in the standard of service received by thetroops.The European services,      Secondly, we know that the Foreign Office and control commission think it essential that the European services should have at their disposal at least three long or mediumwave lengths.    The substitution of the powerful Nordenwavelength for a loss powerful British medium wavelengthwould, by itself, actually improve the coverage of theEuropean Services, but this is not the whole story.      TheB. 3. C. are at present using on the European service a longwavelength (1796 metres)  that was not allocated to thiscountry under the Lucerne Convention and &quot;which is causinginterference in Eastern Europe with Russian broadcasts&quot;from Moscow.    Such interference could almost cortainly be eliminated by mutual agreement but there can be no certainty that the Russians, who dislike the B.B.C, European Services,will in fact prove accommodating on this point.    It is believedthat they intend to raise the question during certaininternational radio discussions due to take place in moscow in mid-September, and, while we would not be withoutresources in such discussions (for the long wave which theRussians themselves&apos;are using at Moscow is not the exact oneallocated to them at Lucerne), there is no certainty that thereafter we will be able to retain the use of the 1796metres wavelength now in use at Ottringham.    Its loss wouldmean that in certain parts of Europe, the B.B.C. would have to rely mainly upon short wave transmissions which though they give a strong signal can only be received by the limited numberof people with short wave sets.Radio L ux ernb o ur g8.      Another factor which enters into this question is the attempt that is&apos;at present being made to secure the use, jointlyby British and French Governments of the Radio Luxembourgtransmitter for broadcasts to Germany and Austria and central europe.    Negotiations to this end are due to start with theLuxembourg Government on the 15th August and if successful willmake available to us a powerful weapon with which to supple-men t the European Services, although the joint use of RadioLuxembourg would not be a satisfactory substitute for theOttringham wavelength should the latter have to be given up.

9.     The position of the European Services, if one Britishmedium wavelength is transferred to the West of EnglandRegion and Norder is made available for the German Service,ceil, therefore, be summar ized as foilows : -(a) If we keep the Ottringham wavelength, the service will have the same number of wavelengths as atpresent (one long and two medium) and itscoverage will be more effective because theNorden wavelength is more powerful than theBritish wavelength which it will have replaced.(b) If in addition we secure the part use of RadioLuxembourg the Service will be able to transmitover 1;V long wavelengths and two medium wavelengths,(c) If the Luxembourg negotiations succeed, but we haveto surrender the Ottringham wavelength, theService will be rather less effective than it  isat the moment as the Improvement due to itsacquisition of Norden and a share of Luxembourg -will -probably not compensate fully for the lossof Ottringham,(d) If we can use neither Ottringham nor Luxembourgthe European Service will be considerably less effective than it is today.Conclusions10,    We have no wish to minimise the importance of maintainingan effective European Service.      We feel, however, that In this case the needs of our own population should be decisive andthat the Government should accordingly meet the demand for thepreservation of the Weat of England region.    Such a step wouldbe fully in accordance with our expressed intention to stimulate the 3.B.C.&apos;s policy of regional devolution and, together withthe introduction of the new.Third Programme, would givelisteners reasonable value for the increased licence charges.11.      We appreciate that in taking such a step we would be running the risk that, in the autumn, the European services will have no long; wavelengths hut the need for a decision is urgent.    Broadcasting programmes must be planned several weeks in advance and we agree with the Governors of the B.B.C.  in thinking that their long delayed Third Programme cannot be delayed beyond the beginning of October.    Unless they canregain one medium wave length from the European Service this could only be done at the expense of the West of EnglandRegion.We accordingly ask the approval of our colleagues forthe foilow ing con conclusion ions:-(i)    The B. A, 0%R. entertainment programmes-from theNorden Station should be terminated and in its place everything possible should be done toimprove the reception of the 3,3,0. LightProgramme by our troops in Germany.    We would hope that no financial impediment would be placedin the way of this improvement.

(ii)    One of the British medium wavelengthsat present in use on the EuropeanService should be used to preserveseparate identity of the West ofEngland Region.(iii)    Our delegates to the forthcoming moscow conference should be instructed toraise the Question of the Ottringhamw ave 1 en gth w i th the Rue si an author itiesat the earliest suitable moment witha view to securing Russian agreement to its retention by the UnitedKingdom.(iv)    Everything possible should be done tobring the forthcoming negotiations withthe Luxembourg Government for thejoint use of Radio Luxembourg by theBritish and French Governments to a successful conclusion.    Here again wewould hope that financial considerations would not unreasonably impede the successof the negotiations.(v)    We should be authorised to make anearly announcement of the Government&apos;decision to reprieve the West of EnglandRegion.H.
