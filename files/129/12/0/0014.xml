DESPATCH OF TROOPS TO IRAQMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of StateWhen my   colleagues discussed on the 15th JulyCP. (46) 269 of the 1.1th July, which the Foreign Secretarycirculated on the subject of the situation in South. Persia,they decided that an Indian Brigade should he moved to theBasra-Sliaiba area forthwith, the troops now awaitingrepatriation from that area &quot;being withdrawn concurrently.2.        I do not wish to call in Question this decision, &quot;butthe Service authorities concerned have now worked out a detailed plan which appears to go beyond what was originally contemplated.The detailed plans provide that the Indian brigade group, with a divisional headquarters, who are being moved to Southern Iraq, shall take with them much heavy- equipment,including a field artillery   regiment of 16 guns and some900 motor vehicles.      The first troops are due to leaveIndia on the 2nd August.      On the naval side, provision is being made for twelve landing-craft and four harbourdefence motor launches to be transported to Basra at thesame time.      I understand that from the Service point ofview it is essential5  if the force is to be capable ofcarrying out all the tasks which might be assigned to it,that it should take this equipment with it.3.        I feel that it may not have been appreciated by mycolleagues, when they were discussing this matter before,that the course of action which they approved would involvepreparations on this scale.      I feel that I should point out certain possible consequences which may follow therefrom,even though these possibilities may not eventuate.k.        Under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, His majesty&apos;s government are not normally entitled to keep ground troopsin Iraq.      During the war.it was possible to do so, but thewar has now been over for some time and the Iraqis areentitled to expect a gradual diminution in the number of ground troops which we are maintaining in their country.Had we only been substituting fresh men for men who were due for relief,  there would have been some chance of passing theoperation off as a normal relief operation.      I fear that itwill   not be possible to do this if we now introduce a large quantity of heavy    equipment and assemble landing-craft and(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY HO.

5.        For some time it lies been explained to the Iraqis thatthe sole reason for the continued presence of &quot;British troops at Basra is the necessity for guarding military stores.But the arrival of new troops,  equipped with artillery,landing-croft    and transport on a large scale, will arouseconsiderable interest.      There may indeed be a good deal ofpolitical agitation.      It will be asked whether the arrival of this new military expedition means that we. intend to useIraq as a base for on attack on Persia - a friendly country,with which Iraq has no quarrel.        It will be suspected,moreover, whatever we may say,  that it is part of a definiteplan to hold down Iraq while decisions which Iraq dislikesare being implemented in Palestine,  and. it will be connectedwith the proposal to send 100,000 new Jewish immigrants to palestine to which the ^.robs strongly object.6.       Any anti-British agitation to which these developmentsmay give rise will be exploited by Russian propaganda,  andmay well lead, to a popular outcry, and a demand for theimmediate withdrawal of our troops,  coupled perhaps with a request for treaty revision.      Were we to refuse to with drawour troops,  the Iraqi Government might well take the case to the United Nations.7.        I feel that Ministers may like to consider theseunpleasant possibilities with a view to the desirabilityof revising the present plans so as not to provoke the unfortunate reactions which,  as pointed out above,  areto be apprehended, in Iraq from the despatch to Basra oftroops and military equipment on the scale at presentcontemplat ed.P.J.N-B.Foreign    Office, S.W.1.31 ST JULY, 1946.    .
