(46) 334.3rd September, 1946.CABINET.MARRIAGE BAR IN THE CIVIL SERVICE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE question of amending the rule under which married women may not nor-mally be employed in established Civil Service posts was raised in an AdjournmentDebate on the 25th July, and I authorised the Financial Secretary to the treasury to say (Official Report, Column 388) that a statement of Government policy wouldbe made soon after the summer recess.2. A Committee of the Civil Service National Whitley Council considered this recently, and their report has been published as a White Paper (Cmd. 6886,copy attached). The Committee made no recommendation either for or againstthe removal of the marriage bar, since the staff associations were hopelesslydivided. For the same reason, there was no agreed recommendation as to possible ways in which the marriage bar might be relaxed, if it were not to be removedaltogether.The Committee made a factual survey of the existing rules (paragraphs 1-24)and of the practice of certain outside employers and other Governments (para-graph 25 and Appendix), and summarised objectively the arguments used by those who want the removal of the marriage bar and those who want its retention-tion (paragraph 26) and the current views of Departments and of staff associations(paragraphs 27-31). It has considered some of the major implications of aremoval of the marriage bar (paragraphs 32-48) and has made a number of specific recommendations on subsidiary points (see paragraph 7 below).3.   The political and feminist aspects of the matter must, of course, beI taken into consideration.   There is undoubtedly strong feeling in favour of; equality of opportunity for married women, and my first inclination was towardsH abolition of the marriage bar, with some safeguard to make it possible to dismissI married women who become inefficient employees owing to domestic ties.4.   But there is some ground for thinking that the complete removal of theI marriage bar might cause serious difficulties on routine work, where careerIprospects are very limited and where rapid turnover of staff through dismissalIon marriage is a considerable advantage from the point of view both of theemploying Departments and of the staff.  These difficulties would be particularlyImarked in the Post Office, and the large Post Office staff associations are stronglylin favour of retaining the marriage bar.   Moreover, whatever rules might belaid down, it would in practice be difficult to dismiss married women whoseefficiency deteriorated for reasons connected with their marriage.5.   The Official Side of the Committee have recommended to me that, inIview of the division of opinion among the staff associations, the marriage barhould not be removed at present; but they think that certain alterations of thelisting rules could reasonably be made, as follows : (a) An employing Department should not at it own discretion reject anapplication from an established woman civil servant to be retainedon marriage; the Treasury should be consulted in all cases.(b) For women in the administrative class, in one of the professional,scientific or technical classes, or in one of the higher grades of theexecutive  and  analogous   Departmental   classes,   retention   after[32344] b
marriage should  be  allowed  automatically  (subject to treasury approval) if the woman concerned has completed seven or more years&apos;satisfactory service.(c) Retention should be granted more freely to women of any grade who marryin the later years of their service.These alterations would modify an agreement made with the Staff Side in1934, and, if approved, would require further discussion with the Staff Sidebefore being publicly announced. They would involve a restatement of the marriage-bar rules on the lines set out in the Appendix.6. On the whole, and despite my own initial reaction in favour of abolitionof the bar, I am impressed by the difficulties which would be occasioned by outrightremoval. I recommend, therefore, that the compromise proposed by the official side of the Committee should be accepted.7. On certain minor points the National Whitley. Council Committee madespecific and agreed recommendations-on the question of paid maternity leave(paragraph 38 of the White Paper), on marriage gratuity (paragraphs 44-45)and on the question of retrospective effect if the marriage bar were to be removed(paragraph 46). I propose to accept these recommendations to the extent to whichthe questions arise after the main issue has been decided.EE. D.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,3rd September, 1946.APPENDIX.UPON application by the women concerned, exception may be made to regulations 1 and 2 (a) above in the following ways : (i) In the case of a woman employed in the administrative class, or in oneof the professional, scientific or technical classes, or in one of thehigher grades of the executive or analogous Departmental classes,retention after marriage will be allowed (subject to Treasury approval)if she has served in the Civil Service for seven years or more tothe full satisfaction of the Head of her Department,(ii) Retention after marriage will also be allowed in any case where, havingregard to the age and length of service of the woman concerned,it would in the opinion of the Head of her Department and theTreasury after joint consideration be unreasonable to refuse it.(iii) The recruitment of a married woman, or retention after marriage, asthe case may be, may be allowed in any case where the Head of theDepartment, the Civil Service Commissioners and the Treasury (ina case of recruitment) or the Head of the Department and the Treasury(in a case of retention) are satisfied after joint consideration that theemployment in the public service of a married woman is advisablein the light of her special qualifications or special experience inrelation to the duties required of her, or of the special requirementsof the Department in which she is serving.

155CIVIL SERVICE NATIONAL WHITLEY COUNCILCOMMITTEE ON THE MARRIAGE BARReportl Introductory.x. We were appointed in consequence of an undertaking, given by the formerChancellor of the Exchequer (Sir John Anderson) to a deputation of Membersof Parliament of all parties, that the marriage bar in the Civil Service shouldbe reviewed by the National Whitley Council; and we agreed to work withinthe following terms of reference:  &quot; To examine the working of the marriage bar in the Civil Service, andthe arguments for and against its retention; and to consider and report uponthe implications of a removal of the bar.&quot;2. We make no recommendation either for or against the removal of the marriage bar. We have confined ourselves to an objective review of theexisting rules, of their working, and of the implications of change, with certain recommendations on subsidiary points, in the hope that such a review mayassist the Government in reaching a decision which must, as we realise, be influenced also by wider economic and social considerations outside the scopeof the National Whitley Council.II. History of the Rules governing the Employment of Married Women in theCivil Service.3. The first official document relating to the position of married women inrespect of Civil Service employment was a Treasury Minute of the 17thMarch, 1894, directing that the services of women typists should cease on marriage and that marriage gratuities should be paid to them. A furtherTreasury Minute of the 21st November, 1895 extended marriage gratuities to all classes of established female labour where resignation on marriage was required by general departmental regulations. Before this, the resignation offemale staff on marriage had been general but not universal: after this Minute,with the prospect of the gratuity held out, it became in practice universal.4. The MacDonnell Commission of 1912-15 considered the marriage bar,but were unable to submit a unanimous recommendation. The majoritywere in favour of maintaining the existing rule intact; apart from considera-tions of family welfare, they believed that &quot; the responsibilities of marriedlife were normally incompatible with the devotion of a woman&apos;s whole timeand unimpaired energy to the public service.&quot; Eight members of the Corn-mission, however, signed a reservation stating that they could not agree to ahard and fast rule of compulsory retirement on marriage, and believed thatthere were many cases, especially in the higher grades or where women were appointed for highly specialized knowledge, where the enforcement of such a rule would act to the public disadvantage.5. In 1919 was passed the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, Section 1of which provides that &apos;&apos; a person shall not be disqualified by sex or marriagefrom the exercise of any public function or from being appointed to any civil or judicial office or post.&quot; There was a proviso to this Section, however,stating that &quot; notwithstanding anything in this section, His Majesty may byOrder in Council authorize regulations to be made providing for and prescribingthe mode of the admission of women to the Civil Service of His Majesty, andthe conditions on which women admitted to that service may be appointedto or continue to hold posts therein ....&quot;.
6. Moreover, in 1921 the Treasury was advised that the legal position wasthat &apos;&apos; when the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act says that a woman isnot disqualified by sex or marriage, it means that the woman is not under aninherent disability from holding certain posts because she is a woman or because she is married. In other words, the appointment of a woman or a married woman to these posts if made would not be invalid. It is quite anotherthing to say that a woman is entitled to be appointed to or to hold anyof the specified posts on exactly the same terms as if she were a man and this in fact is precisely what the Act refrains from saying.&quot;7. The following regulations were made on the 26th August, 1921, underOrder in Council of the 22nd July, 1920:  -&quot; 1. All female candidates for any established situation in any of HisMajesty&apos;s Civil establishments shall be unmarried or widows.2. (a) Women appointed to or holding any established situation in anyof His Majesty&apos;s Civil establishments shall be required to resign theirappointments on marriage, and to notify their marriage to the Head of theirDepartment immediately on its taking place.(6) Women resigning on marriage after service of not less than six yearsprior to their marriage may, at the discretion of the Head of the Depart-ment and with the approval of the Treasury, be granted a gratuity at therate of one month&apos;s pay for each complete year of established service, butnot exceeding in the whole a maximum of twelve months&apos; pay.3. Provided that exceptions may be made to regulations 1 and 2 (a)above, on the recommendation of the Head of the Department, if the CivilService Commissioners and the Treasury (in cases of recruitment), and theTreasury (in the case of an officer already holding an established position)are satisfied that it is in the interests of the public Service that suchexception shall be made. Every such exception shall be published in theLondon Gazette, and officers appointed or retained thereunder will not be eligible for marriage gratuity.&quot;8. The Tomlin Commission of 1929-31 reviewed the matter and tookevidence upon it. None of the official witnesses who gave evidence favoured the removal Of the bar; they took the view that the existing rule was ingeneral the rule most conducive to the efficiency of the Service and that theexisting power to make exceptions was adequate. The views expressed bystaff organizations were divided the balance of opinion was against removalof the bar, in the lower grades, but there was a considerable body of opinion in favour of treating the higher grades differently.9. The majority of the Commission thought that the disadvantages whichwould result from removing the marriage bar would outweigh those resultingfrom its retention, though there should be a discretionary power to makeexceptions.   A minority would have desired to see the bar removed altogether,in conformity with the general principle of &quot; a fair field and no favour,&quot;though they realized that the expressed opinion of the lower grades could notbe disregarded.   All members of the Commission were agreed, however, thatif a discretionary power to make exceptions were to continue it ought to bemade into a more effective instrument than it had been in the past; and they recommended that the discretionary power should be restated as follows:-&quot; Provided that, upon application by the woman concerned, exceptionmay be made to regulations 1 and 2 (a) above in a oase where the Headof the Department, the Civil Service Commissioners and the Treasury (ina case of recruitment) and the Head of the Department and the Treasury(in the case of an officer already in an established position) are satisfied,
156after joint consideration, that appointment to or retention in the publicService of a married woman is advisable in the light of her special quali-ficationsor special experience in relation to the duties required of her.&quot;io. The recommendations of the Tomlin Commission were remitted to theNational Whitley Council Committee on &apos;Women&apos;s Questions (Committee F)for consideration. This Committee agreed to the restatement of the dis-cretionary power in the terms quoted above, with the substitution of the phrase &quot; employment in &quot; for &quot; appointment to or retention in and theaddition at the end of the words &quot; or of the special requirements of theDepartment in which she is serving.&quot;The Committee also agreed: (i) that applications for retention on marriage should be made to Headsof Departments, by whom they Would be submitted to the Treasury for joint consideration,(ii) that cases in which the marriage bar was waived need no longer be published in the London Gazette,(iii) that women appointed or retained after marriage should have no claim to marriage gratuity,(iv) that where married women served on a mobile staff, they shouldnot be entitled to expect any modification in their interests of the con-ditions of service generally attaching to their grade,(v) that the detailed regulations for recruitment to the administrative class and the Tax Inspectorate group should contain a specific referenceto the possibility of retention on marriage; that there should be no such reference in the regulations for the other general classes, since this would merely raise false hopes; and that the question of regulations for depart-mental classes should be considered departmentally,(vi) that a married woman Civil Servant should in the event of con-finement be allowed special leave on full pay for a period not exceeding two months, with an extension aip to three months if recommended by medical certificate; any further leave to be taken as annual leave or leavewithout pay; the period of paid special leave to count towards the maxi-mum period of paid sick leave allowed in any prescribed period,(vii) that (apart from, eases of first appointment) women legallyseparated from or deserted by their husbands and unable to obtain support&quot;from them, and women whose husbands were mentally incapacitated beyondhope of recovery, should be sympathetically considered on their merits witha view to their being treated on the same lines as if they were widows; asregards women whose husbands were physically incapacitated, the staff side would have liked to see similar treatment, but the Official Side didnot feel able to go further than to promise sympathetic consideration fromthe point of view of temporary employment.The recommendations of the Committee were communicated to Depart-ments by Treasury Circular No. 8/34, and regulations giving effect to the newdiscretionary power were made on the 12th June, 1934.11. The rules have remained unchanged since 1934 so far as the employ-ment of married women in established posts is concerned; though, of course,during the war married women have been appointed to or retained in tem-porary posts in very large numbers. Certain administrative changes havetaken place recently, however (by administrative action and not. by national whitley Council agreement). Reference is made in paragraphs 18 and 22below to two of these changes; and here it may be noted, as a further52166 A 2
administrative development, that the reconstruction regulations for recruit-ment to the executive, clerioal and sub-clerical classes, which were published by the Civil Service Commissioners in June, 1945, as well as those for theadministrative class and the Tax Inspectorate group published at the sametime, contain references to the possibility of exceptional retention on marriageIn the administrative regulations, the reference is as follows: -&quot; Permission for retention after marriage will be given where the em-ployment of a particular married woman is considered desirable in viewof her special qualifications or special experience in relation to the dutiesrequired of her, or of the special requirements of the Department in which she is serving. This will normally be interpreted as applying to women who have served for several years to the full satisfaction of their Depart-ment.&quot;In the regulations for the Tax Inspectorate group, the reference is: &quot; Women will normally be required to resign their appointment on marriage, but exception to this rule may be made where the employmentof a particular married woman is considered desirable in the light of herspecial qualifications or special experience in relation to the duties required of her, or of the special requirements of the Department in which she isserving.&quot;In the executive, clerical and sub-clerical regulations, the reference is:  &quot; Permission for retention after marriage will only be given where theemployment of a particular married woman is considered desirable in viewof her special experience in relation to&apos; the duties required of her, or thespecial requirements of the Department in which she is serving.&quot;III. Operation of the Marriage Bar.12. Between 1921 and 1931, when the Tomlin Commission reported, onlyone married woman was retained in the established Civil Service under theoriginal (1921) discretionary power: this small use of the power was themain reason for the Tomlin Commission^ recommendation that its wordingshould be altered.13. In 1932 there was one other case of retention, and since the new regulations were made in 1934 there have been (so far as can be ascertained from Treasury records) 28 further cases, including three on F.S.S.U. Of the30 cases, 19 have taken place in the years 1941-46. Nine of the womenconcerned were in the administrative class (seven Principals, one AssistantPrincipal and an Assistant Administrative Officer), four in Departmentalclasses, one in the executive class (Higher Executive Officer), and sixteenin professional, scientific or technical grades (including the Ministry ofEducation inspectorate and the Factory inspectorate). Seven of them were over the age of 50 at the date of retention; eight between 40 and 50; tenbetween 30 and 40; and five under 30. Six were in the Ministry of Education;four in the Inland Revenue Department; three each in the Ministry of Health,Home Office and Ministry of Labour; two each in the Post Office and Depart-ment of Scientific and Industrial Research; and one each in the Ministryof Agriculture, Department of Health for Scotland, Ministry of national insurance, National Savings Committee, Natural History Museum, Ministryof Town and Country Planning, and War Office.14. Of the 30 women for whom a waiver of the marriage bar has beenapproved, six are no longer in the Service, for the following reasons: 1 retired on reaching the age limit of 60,1 retired on grounds of ill-health,1 resigned on birth of first child,
2 resigned very soon after marriage (in one of these cases there wasa misunderstanding: the woman in question never intended to staypermanently in the Service),i changed her mind after waiver had been approved, and resigned herestablished status on marriage.Of the remaining 24, two (for whom waiver was recently approved) have notyet married.Of the remaining 22, 13 are still employed in the same grade, and nine havebeen promoted (one of them twice). At least one has been promoted out ofturn.15. The wastage after marriage is not unduly high, although of course it has to be borne in mind that in 19 out of the 30 cases the waiver hasbeen granted within the last five years; and those who have stayed in theService seem to have had, on the whole, a normal career.16. We have obtained from Departments certain further information bearingupon the reliability and usefulness, as employees, of the women for whomthe marriage bar has been waived. One important factor is maternity leave.As indicated above, one of the retained married women resigned on the birth of her first child. Of the others, only four have had children andbeen granted maternity leave, three of them for two periods, as follows: 1 had 2^ months 4- 2 months,1 had 3 months 4- 3 months,1 had 4 months 4- 6 months,1 had 3^ months.Four of the others have had at least one long spell of sick leave for other reasons (one subsequently retired on grounds of ill-health). The rest havehad no abnormal sick leave.17. In general, Departments testify that the usefulness of the womenconcerned has in no way been impaired by marriage. There are a few exceptions to this: (a) In one case (the woman in question has since left the Service) domesticduties, etc. caused occasional embarrassment to the Department it is admitted that probably this was accentuated by war conditions.(6) In one case maternity leave came at a very awkward time fromthe Department&apos;s point of view.(cj In three cases there is some  suggestion of  difficulties  due  to iimmobility.   But in two of those cases the question of moving from one &apos;town to another does not seem to have arisen yet, and in the third it isthe Department who have refrained from moving the officer concerned -they do not say that she has asked to be excused from moving.On the other hand, three of the retained married women have in fact moved,from one town to another, since their retention, apparently without objecting.18. In recent years it has been the normal administrative practice togrant retention, on application, to any woman of at least Principal rank inthe administrative class who has served for several years in that class tothe full satisfaction of her Department; and, as indicated in paragraph 11above, this has now been publicly stated in a note in the reconstructionregulations for entry to the administrative class. Practice in regard to the professional, scientific and technical grades is very much the same.19. Treasury records show 17 cases where retention has been applied forand refused, and ten where it has been allowed only for a limited period&apos;pending the filling of a post or the training of a successor. Unfortunatelythis list is not complete, since a number of cases have been considered.52166 a 3
informally without being permanently recorded. Nor, of course, can the record show the number of women who might have wished to apply forretention on marriage but did not do so because they were convinced thatapplication would be useless. Three cases which appear in the list of refusalsappear also in the list of retentions, their applications having been renewedand granted at later dates. Of these 27 cases, four were in the administrative class (all Assistant Principals), one in the executive class, two in the clericalclass, two in typing grades, three in professional grades, and fifteen inmiscellaneous Departmental grades. A complete record of the ages of thewomen concerned is not available, but a high proportion of them were under 30 at the time of application. Five were in the Inland RevenueDepartment, four in the Ministry of Labour, three each in the Ministry ofHealth, Ministry of Pensions, Post Office and Board of Trade, two in theNational Library of Scotland, and one each in the Ministry of EducationHome Office, Natural History Museum and Tate Gallery.20. In the administrative class, out of 35 women entrants through the open competitions in the years 1925-1939, only four have been retained inan established capacity on marriage, and of those two have since resignedFour others resigned on marriage; five stayed on after marriage for a timein a temporary capacity during the war, but have since resigned; and threeare at present retained in a temporary capacity after marriage.21. It is, of course, impossible to say what the picture would have beenif there had been no marriage bar; but it may reasonably be assumed thatthe majority of the women who have left the Civil Service on marriage wouldhave left voluntarily in any case, if not on marriage then on childbirth.22. Full information is not readily available about the recruitment of married women, as distinct from their retention after marriage; but it maybe taken as certain that the question of exercising the discretion allowed by,the regulations in this respect has arisen only in a negligible number of cases.Four married women, however, have recently been appointed to establishedposts under the discretionary power. Three of them are temporary CivilServants established in the Principal grade under paragraph 33 of the white paper on recruitment to established posts during the reconstruction period,Cmd. 6567 (of. what is said in paragraph 18 above as regard current practice on retention); the fourth has been appointed to the post of Governor ofHolloway Prison. For the open reconstruction competitions now being held. for recruitment to basic grades, married women are not eligible, even inthe administrative class.IV. War-Time Experience.23. Experience of married women as temporary employees during the war, has been somewhat varied. Like other employers, (the Government couldnot have managed without its married women employees in the acute shortageof man-power caused by the war; but in comparison with other employees,married women have in many cases been found to have disadvantages. Theyhave tended to be absent or unpunctual because of domestic responsibilities,or ithe difficulty of getting domestic help; they have needed time off forshopping; and they have taken le]avie at very short notice when their husbands came home on leave from the forces.24. It does not, however, follow that similar disadvantages would applyto married women as permanent employees in normal peace-time conditions.Domestic difficulties have been greatly accentuated by the war shoppinghas taken longer, household help has been harder to get and the husband ssudden and unexpected leave from the Forces would not be a factor to be
1VI. Argument For and Against Removal of the Bar.26. We have attempted to summarize below the main arguments whichhave been advanced for and against removal of the marriage bar. Foreasy reading, We have shown them in tabular form; but we recognize thatthis method of presentation does not take account of the fact that in somecases the &quot; positive &quot; argument is an argument for removal, with ananswering argument against, whereas in others the &quot; positive &quot; argument isthe other way. In order to secure as fair a presentation as possible, without undue complication, we have marked the &quot; positive &quot; argument in each caseby an asterisk (in one case we think there is a &quot; positive &quot; argument on.both sides).(a) Social and Economic Arguments.For Removal.*(i) The marriage bar is a restric-tion upon the freedom of the indi-vidual, and is inconsistent withthe spirit of the Sex Disqualifica-tion (Removal) Act.(ii) The argument opposite is notdenied, in the normal case, butrestrictions should not be imposedupon the exceptional woman whochooses to combine marriage witha career.*(iii) The marriage bar may dis-courage marriage, and thus de-press the birth-rate, which issocially undesirable: further, itmay encourage immorality.Against Removal.(i) The Sex Disqualification (Re-moval) Act did not place any obligation upon any employer to employ any individual woman.*(ii) The married woman&apos;s placeis in the home, and home-makingis a full-time job.*(iii) The married woman whocarries on her career aftermarriage may be disinclined tohave children, and thus depressthe birth-rate, which is sociallyundesirable. The wife&apos;s careermay come into conflict with the husband&apos;s and prejudice thehappiness of the family.taken into account in normal times. Moreover, many of the married women who have been temporarily employed in the Civil Service during the war have regarded their jobs only as a means of occupying the time while their husbands were away on war service, or as an alternative to less agreeableforms of national service: women who had deliberately decided to combineemployment with marriage as a permanent peace-time arrangement wouldhave a different outlook.V. Practice of Employers outside the Civil Service.25. We considered that it would be useful, in our examination of thegeneral problems of the marriage bar, to make some enquiry into the practiceof outside employers in this country, and of Dominion and foreign Govern-ments. We have received information covering the practice of banks, rail-way companies, two public corporations, six local authorities, and fiveprivate employers; of the Governments of Canada, Australia and New Zea-land; and of the Governments of the United States of America, the soviet union, Sweden, Denmark and Finland. A summary of this information isattached as an Appendix to this Report.
For Removal.iv) In a state of full employment,there is no need to fear that theemployment of married womenwill deprive others of jobs. Inany case, the numbers involvedwill be quite small; most women,bar or no bar, will want to give up their careers on marriage orshortly after.Against Removal.(iv) Married womenrwill take em-ployment away from those whoneed it more; the household willhave a double income. The re-moval of the bar should not beconsidered until resettlement ofthe men from the Forces has beencompleted.(v) Married women have donevery valuable work during thewar, and have in fact been com-pelled to work, often at con-siderable personal inconvenience.In recognition of this, those whowant to continue their work afterthe war should be allovyed to doso.(v) The case for a permanentchange of policy in favour of thecontinued employment of marriedwomen cannot rest on the record of women, however creditable, inthe abnormal conditions of war;regard must be had to theefficiency arguments. And justbecause of the gratitude felt for what married women have doneduring- the war, the present is nota good time to consider theefficiency arguments dispassion-ately and arrive at theconclusion.right(b) &quot; Efficiency of the Public Service &quot; Arguments.(vi) The Service ought to aim atattracting the best type of recruit:the marriage bar may discouragerecruitment, particularly to thehigher grades.(vi) There is no evidence of theextent to which the marriage barhas in fact discouraged recruit-. ment; but there is a considerablebody of opinion among the largeemploying Departments whichthinks that, in the lower grades atall events, it has not done so, andthat on the other hand the marriage gratuity has attractedrecruits.(vii) The Service should not con-sist entirely of spinsters on thefemale side, any Imore than itconsists entirely of bachelors onthe male side. The married woman&apos;s point of view is likely tobe particularly useful in ad-ministering new social servicesafter the war.(vii) The discretionary power ^ isenough to secure that the married woman&apos;s point of view is1 repre-sented in the Service&quot; when necessary.(a) Social and Economic Arguments contd.
(b) &quot; Efficiency of the Public Service &quot; Arguments contd.For Removal.*(viii) It is uneconomical to train a woman for a particular job andthen to insist that she leaves it on marriage. This applies particu-larly to women &apos; in the1;1 higher grades.Against Removal.(viii) The waste of training causedby resignation on marriage is an argument against employingwomen at all (since most of them will leave voluntarily on marriage), but not an argument against the marriage bar as such.Moreover, it is not a very import-ant argument in the lower grades of the Service.(ix) Most married women who want to continue their careers aftermarriage will do their best tosee that their efficiency is not im-paired. If they become ineffici-ent, they should be dismissed onthat ground and not on theground of marriage. There maybe a few &quot; bad bargains,&quot; but no worse than on the male sideof the Service.Admittedly married womenhave not, as a class, been themost reliable of employees dur-ing the war; but there have beenspecial difficulties during the war(difficulty of getting domestichelp, time spent in shopping, un-expected leave of husbands inthe Forces, etc.) which will notapply normally.*(ix) Married women are less effi-cient employees than singlewomen or men. Apart from ab-sence due to childbirth, they will tend to be absent or unpunctualon account of their families&apos; ill-nesses, etc., as well as their own,and their minds will not be whollyon the job. Even if they are notless efficient immediately aftermarriage than before, they will tend to become less efficient as time goes on; and past experienceof the procedure of dismissal oninefficiency grounds suggests thatit will not be easy to get rid ofthem in that event.The war-time difficulties of get-ting domestic help, shopping, etc.,will persist for some time afterthe war.(x) If a married woman unreason-ably refuses to move from onetown to another when she is re-quired to do so in the interests ofthe Service, disciplinary action can be taken. In some cases atleast, married women will haveno objection to moving e.g.,three of the women for whom the marriage bar has been waivedhave already done so. In any event, immobility is not peculiar to married women men, orsingle women with dependants,are sometimes immobile, but arenot dismissed on that account.*(x) Married women will be lessmobile than other employees,which is a serious inconvenience,particularly in Departments whichhave a provincial organization.
(b) &quot; Efficiency of the public for Removal.(xi) The argument opposite is ad-mitted; but most women will re-sign on marriage in any case, andthe numbers who want to stay onwill not be large enough to makemuch difference to the position inrespect of turnover.Service &quot; Arguments contd.Against Removal.*(xi) Where there is a large amountof routine work to be done, it isa real advantage to employwomen who stay only a few yearsand leave on marriage. Theamount of routine work in theCivil Service is so great that theService cannot provide adequatecareers for all the young personsrecruited to the lower grades: itis essential, therefore, to have a fairly rapid turnover, and mar-riage wastage is a highly impor-tant factor in this.*(xii) The bar should be removed        (xii) If   the   present   discretionaryaltogether  because   the   present power  does  not  work  satisfac-discretionary power operates un- . satisfactorily, that may be a reason forevenly as between Departments. reviewing its scope, but not forThe wording of the discretionary removing the bar altogether,power inevitably leaves the de-cision mainly to the employingDepartment, which is the bestjudge of &quot; special experience,&quot;etc., and the procedure of centralconsideration may tend to be of little value.VII. Current Views of Departments and of Staff Associations27. At the present moment a large majority of employing Departments arein favour of maintaining the existing position, though some think that greater use might be made of the existing discretionary power at the higherlevels, others that the discretionary power might be used at lower levels than hitherto, and others that the wording of the discretionary power itself mightbe widened. Departments are generally agreed that whatever is decided inrespect of the retention of married women should be applied also to the recruitment of married women, particularly of married women with war-timetemporary service.28. To a suggestion that the discretionary power might be amended so asto allow the retention (at certain levels) of any woman who had satisfactorilycompleted her period of probation and was up to the average of efficiency of the grade, Departments are generally opposed: they feel that if there isto be a discretionary power at all (as opposed to a complete removal of the bar) it should be more restricted than this. It is also generally felt by departments that if a discretionary power is to continue the obligation to consult the Treasury (and, in the case of recruitment, the Civil Service Corn-mission) should be maintained. Most Departments feel that the marriagebar can and should be operated differently at different levels of the Service,but there is divergence of view on the question where the line should bedrawn, some thinking that discretion should be allowed only in the administra-tive class, Tax Inspectorate, and professional, scientific and higher technicalgrades, others that it should apply at any level above the basic clerical and executive.

It is understood by the Committee that the organization representing(the administrative class, viz. the Association of First Division Civil Servants,which is not represented on the Staff Side, is strongly in favour of the removalI of the marriage bar.VIII. Implications of a Removal of the Bar.32. As we said at the outset, our terms of reference do not call upon usjjto make a recommendation either for or against the removal of the marriageIbar. We consider, however, that we should draw attention to some of the[consequential problems which a decision by the Government to remove the[bar would involve.33- While the removal, throughout the Civil Service, of the ban on the[employment of married women would not be the first step towards theemployment of married women generally indeed, the marriage bar hasrecently been removed in three employments akin to the Civil Service, viz. the^aching profession (by the Education Act, 1944), the B.B.C. and the Londonjpmnty Council_it would undoubtedly be the most important step in that29. On the other hand, one or two Departments think that the marriage barought to be removed altogether.30. Opinions among constituent organizations of the National whitley council (Staff Side) are so divided on this issue that it would be impracticable to define the attitude of the State Side as a whole in general terms. Thefollowing statement, covering all organizations represented on the Staff Side,shows the factual position based upon the most up-to-date information available:  Date of Total Womendecision membership       membership
direction, both because of the size of the Service and because of the considerable influence that a Government decision in such a matter could trexpected to have on the practice of employers generally. If, following SUc an example, it became the widespread practice for married women to be recruited and retained freely, important social and economic consequence-might follow. But although the abolition of the marriage bar in the CivilService might in this way help to give rise to social and economic implications for the community as a whole, we have not attempted to pursue the subjectinto the wider field, but have confined ourselves to an examination of the implications within the Civil Service of the abolition of the marriage barthere, whether it were abolished elsewhere or not.34. Equal Pay. It has sometimes been urged in opposition to the claim for equality of pay between men and women in the Civil Service that asnormally women resign on marriage some from choice and the rest undercompulsion and as the time and expense spent on the training of thoseresigning is thus lost to the Service, women as a whole are, for this reasonamongst others, less valuable than men as a whole. It is one of the implications of an abolition of the marriage bar that, to the extent to whichwomen would then remain after marriage, this argument would be weakened.By the same token the contention of the advocates of equal pay, that it isunfair to penalize those who remain because of a consideration (amongstothers) relating to those who go, would be strengthened, since the proportionof those remaining would be increased. The exact weighting to be given tosuch arguments in the future cannot be determined so long as the effect of theremoval of the marriage bar upon the retention of women remains an unknownquantity.35. Inconvenience of Married Women as Employees.. If the problem islooked at from the point of view of the Government as employer and ofCivil Service staffs as a whole, perhaps the most obvious implication of aremoval of the marriage bar would be that the Government would have to beprepared to face a certain amount of inconvenience arising from the domesticresponsibilities of its married women employees. We do not consider that a married woman should be retained in the Service if she is frankly not pre-pared to accept the main conditions of service of her grade, including forinstance the liability to move from one town to another in accordance withthe needs of the Service. But occasional absence and irregular attendance,arising solely from domestic responsibilities, would be inevitable though they ought not to be so large a problem as they have been in war-time con-ditions. Moreover, absences of several weeks or months on maternity leavewould have to be allowed for.36. It can of course be argued that a woman who wants to stay in heremployment after marriage ought to be prepared to accept the full liabilities of the employment, including regular attendance; and that if it proves thatshe is, even in a minor degree unprepared to accept those liabilities, sheought to be dismissed as an inefficient employee (not as a married woman).But past experience has shown that it is not always easy to bring dissatis-faction with an employee&apos;s efficiency to the point of dismissal; and in anycase it would obviously be impossible, if married women are to be employed at all, to apply this argument to absence due to childbirth.37. We conclude, therefore, that some minor inconvenience would haveto be faced, both by employing Departments and by the colleagues of the married women. The amount of inconvenience would depend entirely, 01course, upon the number of married women who would want to continue their employment after marriage if the marriage bar did not exist and upon the
I number who would stay after childbirth; and we have no evidence as toI ^jjgj; these numbers are likely to be.38. Maternity Leave. At present, a married woman who is employed inan established capacity is allowed, for childbirth, special leave on full pay for a period not exceeding two months, with an extension up to three monthsif recommended by a medical certificate. Maternity leave on full pay countsa3 part of the normal entitlement to sick leave (which is up to six monthson full pay in any period of twelve months, thereafter six months on halfpay, subject to a maximum of twelve months&apos;&quot; leave in any period of fouryears or less, and thereafter further leave at pension rate); but any furthermaternity leave must be taken either as annual leave or as leave without pay.\Ve have considered whether any alteration in these arrangements is necessary or desirable. It seems to us difficult to defend an arrangement which maytreat illness arising out of childbirth less generously than illness due to anyother cause; and we are agreed that in future an established married womanshould in any case be allowed two months&apos; leave on full pay for childbirth,counting as part of her normal sick leave entitlement, and thereafter should,as a matter of course, be eligible for further sick leave, within her normalentitlement, for as long as she herself is medically certified to be unfit for duty.39. Staff Turnover. A decision to remove the marriage bar would also have complications of the utmost importance as regards, the turnover of staffin the large routine grades which are inevitably required in the Civil Service.The amount of routine work to be done is so great and will continue to beso, in spite of increasing mechanization that the Civil Service staff&quot;pyramid &quot; is bound to have a very broad base, and promotion to migher ranks cannot come to all. Under present conditions, a large number ofwomen Civil Servants never enter the field of competition for promotion, since they resign on marriage after only a few years&apos; service. Their retention aftermarriage would be bound to slow down the rate of promotion as a whole,and it cannot be expected that this would be welcomed by their colleagueswhose prospects would thereby be worsened- in fact, in some cases it wouldbe violently resented. Further, the retention of married women in gradesabove the basic would reduce the number of vacancies in those grades and hence the numbers of promotion opportunities. It may be argued that the disadvantage to the other members of the staff is counterbalanced by theadvantage to the married women themselves of being able to continue their employment after marriage; but even this advantage is questionable where theemployment is monotonous routine work. Moreover, any general worseningof promotion prospects among the large bodies of staff engaged on routinework would, by its adverse effect on staff morale, foe against the interests notonly of the staff themselves but of the public service.40. At whatever level above the basic women are retained on marriage inany numbers, the check to the flow of promotion will be felt all the waydown, and will be the more resented at the lower levels if these levels arenot themselves given the compensating opportunity of retention on marriage.But if there is that compensating opportunity, then to the extent to whichadvantage is taken of it staffs in routine grades will be condemned to longerperiods of monotonous work than if the marriage bar had been enforced.The practical importance of these arguments in the lower grades dependsentirely, of course, upon the number of women who would want to continue their employment after marriage if there were no marriage bar which, aswe have already said, can only foe guessed at. The argument of reducedpromotion opportunities is not important in the highest grades of the Service,and less important in the middle grades than in the lower.
41. Marriage Gratuity. A decision to remove the marriage bar would immediately involve a consequential decision on the future of the marriagegratuity system; and in some ways this is one of the most important practical problems that would have to be faced.42. As explained in paragraphs 3 and 7 above, the marriage gratuity con-desists of one month&apos;s pay for each completed year of established servicesubject to a qualifying period of six years&apos; total service and to a maximumgratuity of one year&apos;s pay. It is usual for outside employers who havecontributory superannuation schemes to return to a woman who resigns on marriage her own contributions plus interest; but the Civil Service marriagegratuity is more generous than this according to a calculation made by theGovernment Actuary, it is just about twice the amount represented by anotional 5 per cent, contribution in the case of a woman clerical officer.The justification for this generosity to the woman civil servant who resignson marriage is that her resignation is compulsory: the gratuity is, under existing rules, dependent upon resignation and a married woman who isexceptionally retained after marriage in an established capacity gets nogratuity, even if she subsequently resigns.43. In theory, if the marriage bar were abolished, there would be severalpossible courses of action with regard to the marriage gratuity. We have attempted to set these out below:  (i) The gratuity could be abolished altogether and forthi&amp;ith.Resignation on marriage would, if there were no marriage bar, be a voluntary decision; and upon a voluntary resignation from the CivilService for any other reason, no gratuity is paid. Many of the advocates of &quot;a fair field and no- favour &quot; would agree that a removal of the barshould be accompanied by the abolition of the gratuity.But if it be accepted that the majority of women Civil Servants would want to resign on marriage, bar or no bar, the majority would lose bythe abolition of the gratuity; and the removal of the marriage bar onthese terms would be certain to encounter very strong staff opposition.We do not regard it as a practicable course of action.(ii) The gratuity might be reduced in amount.It would - be reasonable to&apos; expect the Government as employer to beat least as generous as the outside employers who return the super-annuation contributions of women who resign on marriage; as indicated above, however, this would produce amounts considerably less than thepresent gratuities.This also, for the reason given above, would be strongly opposed bythe staff.(iii) The gratuity might be preserved for existing staff (i.e. staff already in the Service at the date of the abolition of the marriage bar) but abolishedor reduced for new entrants.This would not disturb existing expectations and would presumablybe much less unpopular with the staff than either (i) or (ii). It is thecourse which the London County Council have adopted on the abolitionof their marriage bar. (They have a contributory superannuation scheme,and will continue to return superannuation contributions to women whoresign on marriage, but will not pay to new entrants the larger marriagegratuity hitherto&apos; paid.)(iv) The gratuity, if retained (either at its present amount or at a reducedamount) might be paid only to women who actually resign on marriage;alternatively, it might be paid on resignation for any reason connected with
1marriage, e.g. on childbirth; or as a middle course, it might be reduced in amount (or at any rate not increased by reason of service after marriage) ifresignation took place after the actual date of marriage.The former is the present system. Its continuance would encouragewomen to make a definite choice one way or the other at the time of marriage. A married woman who felt free to change her mind at anytime and give up her job, without financial penalty, would tend to be a half-hearted and unreliable employee; and the higher the grade, themore important this argument. On the other hand, it may not always be desirable to discourage resignation after marriage, (i) Where quickstaff turnover is valuable, a resignation a. few years after marriage is nearly as useful as a resignation on marriage, (ii) Where a married woman has misjudged her capacity to combine employment with marriage,and feels her efficiency deteriorating, her resignation ought to be en-couraged. In both cases the financial inducement of the gratuity maybe important, and this argument would favour the second of the two alternative courses.44. We recommend that, even if the marriage bar were to be completelyremoved, the marriage gratuity should be retained at its present amount.This recommendation is made on the assumption that the majority of womencivil servants would still resign on marriage; we do not think it would be reasonable to penalize the majority for the sake of those who would wish toremain.45. We also recommend that the gratuity should continue, as at present,to be payable on resignation at the time of marriage only, and not on resigna-tion for any reason subsequently. We feel that any other rule would inpractice be difficult to administer, and that this would outweigh the possible advantages mentioned above.46. Reinstatement. If the marriage bar were to be removed, it would benecessary to decide whether the removal should have any retrospective effect,i.e. whether a woman who&apos; had resigned compulsorily before the removal ofthe bar should have any opportunity of reinstatement. We recommend againstretrospective effect. It is normal practice that alterations in Civil Serviceconditions of service should not have retrospective effect, and such a woman,having received the treatment due to her according to the conditions in operation at the time of her marriage, would have no valid claim to- anything better.47. Recruitment. It would be necessary to decide whether the removal ofthe marriage bar was intended to permit the recruitment of married women toestablished posts, as well as the retention of women in established posts aftermarriage. There are many classes, of course, where the question of recruitingmarried women will never arise in normal times e.g. the clerical and sub-clerical classes, where recruitment normally takes place between the ages of10 and 17, and the executive class, where the normal age of recruitment is 18.In the professional, scientific and technical field, however, the maximum ageof recruitment may be such that married women might well be among the candidates. We have been unable to reach an agreed view on this. TheStaff Side consider that, to the extent that the retention of women aftermarriage is allowed, the recruitment of married women should be allowed a,so. The Official Side feel, however, that the arguments for retaining womenafter marriage in the interests of the efficiency of the public service do notapply with equal force to the recruitment of married women, and that it shouldnot be necessary under normal conditions to consider such recruitment exceptm the professional, scientific and technical field.

It must be pointed out that if the marriage bar is to be removed it is highly desirable, for reasons connected with reconstruction recruitment, thatthe decision should be taken in the very near future. We do not regard it aspracticable to admit married women to any type of recruitment^ when once the closing date for applications has passed and the process of selection is ;nfull swing. On the other hand, a removal of the marriage bar which did notapply to the open reconstruction competitions would be deeply resented bymarried women eligible on every other ground for these competitions; and since the closing date for applications by civilians to sit for the competitionsis the 1st June, 1946, we think that the removal of the marriage bar, if itwere to be decided upon, should be announced in time to allow marriedwomen to apply by that date.
