Cypher O.T.P.TO PALESTINE (Gen.. Sir A. Cunningham)FROM S.   OF S.   COLONIESSent 5th August, 1946, 22.00 hrs.TOP secret no.  1414Addressed High Commissioner, Palestine.Repeated Governor, Cyprus, No.  295.My immediately preceding telegram.      Following istext of draft announcement.      Begins,In December, 1945,  the quota permitting the entry into Palestine of 75,000 Jewish immigrants under theprovisions of the White Paper was exhausted.Nevertheless, pending a final decision on future policy   .for Palestine His Majesty&apos;s Government authorised a continuance of Jewish immigration at the rate of 1,500a month.      Unfortunately, instead of this provision being accepted, there has been an increasing flow of illegal immigrants into Palestine.      These numbers have had tobe set off against the monthly quota which has nowbeen anticipated.      The result is that there are largenumbers already detained in camps in Palestine, while there are many others in ships in Haifa Harbour or on thehigh seas.His Majesty&apos;s Government has been as is knownconcerting plans with United States representatives for providing for increased immigration into Palestine under conditions which would not disturb the peace and economy of the country.      They have, moved by sympathy for the sufferings of the Jewish people in Europe, hithertoallowed illegal immigrants to land, but it is now clearthat the present illegal immigrant traffic is notdietated solely by the sympathy which is so widelyfelt for suffering, but is a deliberate and highlyorganised plan supported by considerable funds whichhas been put into operation by unscrupulous persons inan attempt to anticipate a decision on the main question.Apart from its illegality and the great danger to law and order in Palestine,  this action is causingacute suffering to many distressed persons.      provided with forged visas, herded into over-crowded andunseaworthy ships, with insufficient food and in conditions of the utmost privation and squalor, theyare brought across the Mediterranean inspired by a conviction, -which has been instilled into them,  thatthis is their only road to safety.      But it is quite clear that the traffic has not been confined to Jewsfrom Displaced Persons Centres in Western Europe, but has also included Jews from Roumania and other eastern european territories,  sailing in ships despatched fromBlack Sea ports.

This traffic is operating with increasingunfairness towards those immigrants who would otherwise have been able to enter Palestine legally under the quota, and much unnecessary suffering to them and their families has arisen from this cause.      At the presenttime,  the continued increase in the scale of this traffic is likely to affect adversely the hopes of any generalPalestine settlement, and, in particular,  the successof the forthcoming conference with Jews and Arabs.The reception and guarding of large numbers of immigrants put an unbearable strain on an administration the functioning of which has necessarily been impairedby the losses in personnel caused by the outrage atthe King David Hotel and by terrorist activities.    Itis obvious that, having regard to the evidence thatthe terrorist elements have been reinforced by personsentering Palestine illegally, the promiscuousintroduction of large numbers of persons is out of thequestion.Por all these reasons, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill no longer tolerate these attempts designed to force their hands in framing a new policy for Palestine.They have made representations to the Governmentsof the countries from which the immigrants aredespatched, in order to stop the traffic at its source.They have now given instructions to the PalestineAuthorities that the reception into Palestine ofillegal immigrants must cease.      Those now on board ship in Haifa and those arriving on further ships now on the high seas will &quot;be conveyed to Cyprus fordetention in camps there,  until the question of theiradmission into Palestine can be considered in the lightof future immigration policy.      Daring their stay in Cyprus all reasonable measures will be taken fortheir health and well-being.In announcing these decisions, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment wish to make clear  their  sincere sympathy with Jewish suffering and their earnest desire topress forward towards a permanent solution of thePalestine problem.      At the same time,  they are determined that this unscrupulous attempt to exploit the sufferings of unfortunate people, in order tocreate a situation prejudicial to a final settlement,cannot be tolerated and the authority of theMandatory Power must be supported.      Ends.
