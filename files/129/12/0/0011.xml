Hi(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 8 GOVERNMENT)0SEC RETQjPjdMl - COPY no.51st July,  tgjj.6CABINETTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNINGTdEVELOPMENT RIGHTS) bill memorandum by the Lord President of the Councilit The Sub-Committee on Compensation and Development ofthe Lord Presidents Committee discussed on Tuesday, 30th July,the Minister of Town and Country Planning&apos;s memorandum(C, P.(U6) 296) on the Development Rights Bill and it mayfacilitate discussion at the Cabinet if I give a briefindication of the views formed by the Sub-Committee on thepoints at issue.Compensation for the General Restrictions2, The Majority of the members of the Sub-Committee were inclined to favour  she discount basis of compensation forout-of-pocket loss.The refund basis of compensation presents very substantialdifficulties from the point of view of valuation.      The discountbasis, on the other hand, presents no serious difficulties onthis score, and of the two sthernes it may prove to be more flexible in allowing concessions to be made,  for example,  inregard to the amount to be paid out in compensation.3* The general view of the Sub-Committee was that some payment would have to be made in respect of Death Duties paid on development values in cases in which no compensation wouldbe j)ay&amp;ble under the out-of-pocket formula.      It would, not beregarded as just  co have taxed a man in respect of developmentvalues and then to confiscate those values without making anyrefund on what had been paid.      The exact provisions to beincluded-in the Bill would have to.be discussed between theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Town and country planning and the Secretary of State for Scotland.4. We agreed- that the Treasury and the Planning departments should examine whether it would be practicable to give stock,rather than cash,  in payment of compensation.Application to Developed Land5. The Sub-Committee agreed that the limitation of compensation to out-of-pocket loss should apply to developed land as well asto undeveloped land.Finance and Central Purchase6, The Sub-Committee preferred the grant scheme outlined inthe Minister of Town and Country Planning&apos;s paper to the system

of central purchase which he originally put forward.The Sub-Committee recommends the grant scheme fordo ption.Planning Authorities7. The Sub-Committee recognised the force of the argumentput forward by the Minister of Town and Country Planning infavour of planning functions being left with county districts and the City of London.      Briefly, these argumentsare that the County districts ore responsible for theexecution of the plans and    it is undesirable to divorcepreparation from execution.      Further, by means of joint committees it is possible to group planning authorities intounits which are more suitable for planning purposes thanadministrative Counties would be in many cases.Nevertheless,  having regard to the relativeinefficiency of   many District Councils and to the special arrangements which could be made for Joint planning authorities,  even if the preparation of plans was made a function of County Councils and County Borough Councils, themajority of the Sub-Committee considered that planning functions should be taken out of the hands of County districts and given to County Councils.The City of London presents a rather special problem,and the Minister of Town and Country Planning proposes to investigate specially the question whether there are any practical objections to the transfer of planning functions in respect of the City to the London County Council.Control of Outdoor Advertisment8. In vie?/ of the urgency of securing control ofoutdoor advertisement, the Sub-Committee recommend that thematter1 should be handled, in the present Bill.      Thealternative, which would involve delay, would be to leavethe subject to &quot;be dealt with in an Amenities Bill which is contemplated for another Session.H.M.Privy Council Office, S.W.1.31st July, 1946.
