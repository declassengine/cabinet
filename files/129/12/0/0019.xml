Earlier this year the views of the Ethiopian Governmentwere sought regarding the proposals which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had in mind to put forward at the Council ofForeign Ministers for the creation of a United Somalia.These proposals involved the incorporation in United &apos;Somalia of certain Ethiopian territory (i.e. Reserved area and the Ogaden, which are at present under british administration by virtue of the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreementof 19kk),  in addition to British and Italian Somaliland.3.        In the event, it will be remembered that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment decided not to proceed with the United Somaliaproject at this stage, but considered that it should not be abandoned altogether^.      In the meantime the ethiopian government indicated that they were averse to the consideratioof the project by the United Nations and that they preferred that any negotiations should, be undertaken with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment direct.      They have now come forward with theproposal that if a corridor to the sea, to the port of Zeilain British Somaliland,  could be given to Ethiopia,  theywould,  in return, be prepared to cede to British Somalilandpart of the Ogaden in exchange.     Further, they are readyto convene a conference on Lake Tana and to have a boundary commission at once to meet His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s requirements in respect of the rectification of frontiers onthe Kenya and Sudan borders which have been a continuingsource of trouble for many -years.      Although these questionshave not been specifically linked together by the Emperor,it would seem advisable to be as helpful as possible tothe Ethiopians in connection with the proposals for an exchange of territory in British Somaliland since the kenya and Sudan Governments have little or nothing to offer in exhange for the rectification which they seek;    nor have theGovernments concerned so far as can be seen at present, an

k*      In respect of British Somaliland the Ethiopianproposals offer good prospects of meeting, to a veryconsiderable extent, the long-standing requirement of the British Somali tribes for free and undisturbedaccess to grazing areas essential to their livelihood.We are anxious, now that the Ethiopian Governmenthave themselves moved in the matter, to seize theopportunity which may well not recur, of rectifying the&apos;injustice done to the British Somali tribes by thetreaty with Ethiopia in 1897 which left their grazinggrounds on the Ethiopian side of the frontier.    Wetherefore think it desirable to open negotiations onthe general basis proposed by the Ethiopians withoutdelay.5.      The Ethiopian proposals have accordingly been examined in detail by the Departments concerned.    A noteis annexed analysing their implications and reco.niii.iendingaction;    a map is also annexed,^   In brief, the linerecommended in this annex is that the general -principleof the proposed exchange should be accepted but thatthe areas involved on both sides of the exchange shouldbe limited to less than the&apos; Ethiopians have proposed.Prom the British Somaliland point of view there are strong arguments for ceding only a narrow strip of corridor tothe Ethiopians, and also for taking over less territory in the Ogaden than lias been offered to us.    The case on both those counts is explained in detail in the annex andnoed not be recapitulated,6,      In addition to the interests of British Somalilandalone and our relations with Ethiopia, there are also certainextraneous factors to be taken into account.    The first ofthese is the uncertain future of Italian Somaliland.    Theterritory which the Ethiopians have offered, to us includes the only useful land communications between British andItalian Somaliland, and would be of considerable Importanceif, as a result of the eventual settlement of the italian colonies, wo should find ourselves responsible for italian somaliland,      A similar position would arise if it shouldever become possible to create a United Somalia on the basisof collective trusteeship (a possibility which has been left open by a recent Cabinet decisiorr).      Therecommendations in the annexed note have taken this possibility into account in considering how much of theterritory now offered to us we should accept.7.      French reactions have also to be taken into account,since French Sornaliland lies on the other frontier of british somali land, and  the proposed corridor would substituteEthiopia for Great Britain as the neighbour of FrenchSomaliland on this side.    Moreover, the whole object ofthe Ethiopians&apos;  proposal is to obtain direct access to thesea, thereby by-passing the French port of Jibuti  and theFrench controlled railway whioh leads to it and which atpresent is Ethiopia&apos;s main commercial outlet.    It is thereforeprobable that the exchange of territory, ifaffected, would not be welcomed by the French,+ -To-Abev. e-i $ oul &amp; t?e dr&quot;l at en,$ CM, (46) 61st Conclusions,  item 5.

The advantages of the exchange from the point ofview of British Somaliland are, however, so great that this factor is not of sufficient weight to deter us from proceeding.    It would, however,he advisahle to inform the French at some stage(not necessarily at the outset) of our intentions.^ *      Conclusions.Our re ccmmendat ions are as foilow s:-(i)    that the Ethiopian offer should hefollowed up without delay;(ii)    that negotiations should he openedon the oasis of a more limitedexchange of territory (the detailsof which are given in Section P ofthe annexed note), hut that our negotiators should he given somelatitude to make adjustments in theproposed frontiers in the light ofEthiopian reactions to our openingoffer.(initialled)    B.B,G.

ETHIOPIAN PROPOSAL FOR EXCHANGE OF TERRITORYWITH BRIT 18H SQMAL HiAM)A. THE ETHIOPIAN PROPOSALS.1.      The following proposals for an exchange of territory-were made by the Ethiopian Vice-MInister of ForeignAffairs to Mr. Bevin on 13th June.(a) A corridor to the sea approximately 100 mileswide at the western end of British Somalilanct,including the port of Zeila to be ceded byBritish Somaliland to Ethiopia.(b) The Ogaden as far south as the Webbe Shebellito be ceded by Ethiopia to British Somaliland.2.      It will be observed that, under this proposal, the ethiopians propose to retain the Reserved Area and therest of the Ogaden south of the Webbe Shebelli.    Evidently,however, they are willing to consider surrendering atleast part of their Somali territories, if in return theycan get something (access to the sea) which is of more value to them.3.      It should bo noted that, although these proposals are expressed in terms of exchange of territory, there wouldlegally be no cession of territory by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.    British Somaliland is not British territorybut merely a protectorate, and the &quot;exchange&apos;&apos; would involvethe surrender by His Majesty&apos;s Government of their protectionof and jurisdiction over the persons inhabiting the corridorto Zeila.      As regards the Hand and North Ogaden, Ethiopiawould surrender sovereignty over that territory, and HisMajesty&apos;a Government would correspondingly extend itsprotectorate and jurisdiction.B. IMPLICATIONS OF SURRENDERING THE CORRIDOR1. The corridor which the Ethiopians propose is much wider than that which was considered in the 1930&apos;s andwider than is necessary to Ethiopia for the purpose of access to the sea at-Zeila, The roads and tracks fromEthiopia to Zeila lie close to the western frontier ofBritish Somaliland adjacent to French Somaliland.2.      This corridor is inhabited by three tribes.    Readingfrom west to east, they are a small portion of the Essa,the Gadabursi, and part of the Issak (Habr withdrawal).      the parts of these  tribes which live In the corridor are, ofcourse, British protected.      The greater proportion of theEssa who are not British protected, live in Ethiopia(including the Reserved Area) and French Somali land.    Itshould not present insuperable difficulties  to withdrawBritish protection from that part of the tribe which nowlives in British Somaliland.    This would vacate an areasufficient to provide the minimum corridor and communications to Zeila desired by the Ethiopians (see paragraph I above).The Gadabursi and the Issak (Habr withdrawal), however, are twoof the most important of the British Somali tribes.    Theywould undoubtedly resent bring transferred to Ethiopiancontrol, and in any event this could not be done without their consent.    Moreover, this does not appear essentialfrom the Ethiopian point of view.

3.   . The corridor proposed by the Ethiopians also contains about 50E of what has been identified as thepossible mineral producing belt in British Somaliland.The potentialities of this belt have not yet been fullyassessed, but the prospects of finding oil in the area are not promising.h.      There is no military objection to the surrender ofa corridor.    In war, however, the coast of british somali land may have considerable value for establishingradar cover over the approaches to the Red Sea, andfrom this point of view as- little as possible of thecoast should be ceded.5.     The provisional conclusion from the above is that, ifany corridor is to be ceded, it should preferably be an arrow one limited to the road to Zeila and the territories of the Essa tribe.      This should also satisfy the realrequirements of the Ethiopians.6.      If it were decided to give the Ethiopians only that part of the corridor inhabited by the Essa tribe, it isessential that we should obtain that part of the ReservedArea which lies opposite the part of British Somalilandinhabited by the Gadabursi and the Habr withdrawal tribes, andforms their grazing grounds.    In this case only a smallportion of the Reserved Area should remain with Ethiopia,and the balance of the Reserved Area would have to be.added to the territory in the Ogaden to be ceded to us byEthiopia.    Although Jigjiga was not included in the grazinggrounds as defined by the Anglo-Ethiopian Commission of1935, the experience of the British administration in thearea since 19hl has  shown that it is the hub of theadministration, and if it is possible to secure part ofthe Reserved Area, every effort should be made to includeJ igj investigation.C.      IMPLICATIONS OF-ACQUIRING THE NORTH CGADEN1.      The limited objective for British Somaliland alone isto obtain the essential grazing areas of the British Somalitribes, namely a strip of territory between 50 to 100 mileswide (i.e. the Haud and Reserved Area grazing grounds) along the whole southern and south western border of british somali land with Ethiopia,      Most of this area is includedin the Ethiopian offer.2.      The area suggested by the Ethiopians also Includes a.great deal more than the Haud.    It would incorporate an area whore we have no claims in respect of British Somalilandand a number of Somali tribes with whom we have had noprevious connection (apart from the present military administration).

3.      This additional territory is arid c ountry of noapparent value to us by itself.    It seems improbable that oil is a factor of importance in consideringthe present proposals.    It also appears that it offersno s trategic facilities which could not equally wellbe secured in British Somaliland alone.km      The provisional conclusion, in terms of british somali land alone, is therefore that there is no great advantage to us in obtaining the whole of the NorthOgaden end that it would be sufficient and more advantageous to take simply the Haud (i.e, the remainingportion of the grazing areas) with the addition of that part of the Re served Area lying opposite and essentialto the Gadabursi and the Issak (llabr withdrawal).D.       EFFECT OF FUTURE PI SIPS,do OF ITALIAN 30I1ILILSITD.1.      A decision on the disposal of the ex-Italian Colonieswill not be taken In the Italian Peace Treaty itself but will be worked out during the ensuing year&quot;.     During thisinterim period Italian Sornaliland will remain under british military administration.    The Ogaden and ReservedArea (which are Ethiopioxi territory) will also remain under British military administration so long as theprovisions of the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of 19kk areeffective.2.     We cannot rule out the possibility that, when thedisposal of the Italian Colonies is finally settled, theUnited Kingdom will be allotted the -permanent administrationof Italian Somaliland.    A United Somalia under collectivetrusteeship is, of course, also a possibility.    If Britishand Italian Somaliland were thus eventually to come under one administration, it would be desirable that this administration should also control the Greath North Road.The road is the only useful lino of communication between thetwo territories and would be important for administrativepurposes.    The territory covered by the road is inhabitedby Ogaden tribes who would be a constant  source of troubleto the combined administration if they were not under itscontrol.-   There are in fact two roads, but for the purposesof this note they are treated as one.    If the general lineof our proposals are accepted by the Ethiopians, the detailsof the boundary with regard to the roads can be worked out later.3.      If our object is to reach a settlement with the ethiopians before the future of Italian Somaliland is known,it   appears most advisable for us to accept the offer of asmuch Ethiopian territory in the North Ogaden as would give us control of the Great North Road,     Territory to the southwest beyond the road would remain of little value to us inany eventuality.    Since the Great North Road is whollyincluded in the territory which the Ethiopians have offered,it would seem short-sighted to discard it at the outsetand to limit what we take purely to the requirements ofBritish Somaliland.a   C. F.M. (1-1-6) 1+1 at Meeting, Item 1.

k*    It is, of course, possible that, when the ethiopians learn that we wish to cede only a narrowcorridor instead of the wide one for which they have asked, they in turn may reconsider their offer of territory in the Ogaden and wish to limit the cededterritory there to the Haud only.    It would be unwise to insist on acquiring territory as far south as theroad if the price recuired was the cession of a wideinstead of a narrow corridor.    If the negotiations should reach this point, it might therefore be necessary toabandon the road.    In doing so, however, it would be most desirable to reach a firm understanding with, the ethiopians on the following two points(a) that they would agree to keep in effect the provisions of the 19kh ^nglo-Ethiopian Agreement providing forBritish administration of the Ogadenand Reserved Area, so long as british military administration remains in Italian Somaliland, i.e, , untilthe Italian colonial settlement.This would preserve our control ofthe Great Forth Road during the interim period;(b) that, if as a result of the Italiancolonial settlement, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should assume the permanentadministration of Italian Sornalilandjthe Ethiopions would allow us to re-open the question of ceding at leastenough - territory to give us controlof the road.E.      TIMING1.      This is a great step forward and the EthiopianVice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is now in Paris forthe peace conference will certainly expect to carry homewith him some indication of His Majesty&apos;s Government1s viewson these proposals.    It Is important that he should be ableto do this since the present favourable opportunity for asettlement may not recur and should not be lost,2,      Our tenure of the Reserved Area and the Ogadenis governed by the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement of 19UUwhich the Ethiopians can terminate with effect from march, 1947*    It is most desirable that we should cometo some agreement with them before this date and we have little more than six months in which to do so.Even so, it may become necessary, as the negotiationsprogress, to ask the Ethiopians to extend the Agreementuntil a final settlement has been reached.

F.      ACTION RECOMMENDED1,      We should reply to the Ethiopian approach byinforming them that we are willing to consider an exchange of territory, but that the size of the areas to he exchanged&apos; and the conditions of their transferwill require careful study &quot;by both sides.    We should propose that negotiations should begin on the following basis:-(a) the corridor to be ceded to Ethiopia to belimited to a strip of country covering the road to Zeilia and the territory ofthe Essa tribe;(b) the North Ogaden territory ceded to british somali land to be limited to the Haud withthe addition of an area sufficient tocover the Great North Road,    (In certaincircumstances (see Section D, paragraph h)we might have to confine our requirements to the Haud only.)(c) assuming that (a)  is accepted, British Somalilandshould also receive as much of the ReservedArea as is essential to the Gadabursi andIssak (Habr withdrawal)  tribes (this territory was,of course, not included in the original Ethiopianoffer).
