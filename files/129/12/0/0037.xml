(46) 337.Qth September, 1946.CABINET.SILVER.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.SILVER has become very expensive. Its London price per fine oz. has risen from 23d. in 1939 to 55^d. at the present time. It has, in my view, becometoo expensive to continue to be used as coinage.   (I attach a brief historical note.)2. Our present stocks are nearing exhaustion and we now need to buysilver (i) for coinage, the circulation of which keeps on increasing owing to highemployment and high prices;(ii) for industrial purposes; and(iii) to enable us to meet our obligations to hand back to the United Statesan amount of silver equal to the amount which the United Kingdomand India borrowed from them during the war.3.   There is a world shortage of silver, due to (i) hoarding on a large scale, especially in India;(ii) increasing demands for coinage and industrial uses; and(iii) the building up of large stocks by the United States Treasury underpressure from the Silver Senators.4. I therefore propose that no new silver coins should be minted and thatour present supply should be gradually replaced, over the next ten to twenty years,by new cupro-nickel coins. The silver thus withdrawn would be used to meet oursilver liabilities mentioned above. Cupro-nickel coins were used in many foreigncountries before the war. Though less bright than good silver coins, I am advised that they would be satisfactory in appearance and use. The cost of cupro-nickelwould only be about l/40th of that of the same weight of silver.I do not advise the issue of notes for less than 10s., owing to their shortlife, which makes them expensive, and to difficulties of production and handling.They soon become dirty and crumpled.5. If we cease to mint silver coins, I see no good reason why His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should continue to buy silver. But I should have no objection to private traders purchasing, with a view to re-export or to industrial use in thiscountry. Import licences would, of course, be required and the existing adminis-trative provisions to secure the maximum export of silver articles would continue.6.   I therefore recommend (i) The gradual substitution of cupro-nickel for silver in our coinage.(ii) The introduction, immediately after the Recess, of legislation to permitthis, and its passage as soon as possible, in order to save furtherunnecessary purchases of silver.(iii) The cessation of Government purchases of silver.(Initialled) H. D.I    Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,Qth September, 1946.[32355]
Brief Historical Note.1. Up till 1939 our main sources of silver were the United States andIndia. There is no home production. On the outbreak of war, as we wishedto economise in dollars, we stopped buying from the United States.2. Early in 1941 India ceased to sell silver in the London market, andfrom that date the Treasury has been responsible for acquiring silver bullion,both for currency and for commercial needs.3. For some time after 1941 the Government of India sold silver to theTreasury, but later the increase of hoarding in India made this impossible.Other sources of supply were quickly exhausted and we were glad to acceptsilver from the United States on lend-lease terms, including an obligation to repay in kind within five years of a declaration by the President that the stateof emergency is over. In all we took 88 million fine ounces of silver on these terms.4. The Government of India acquired from the United States 226 millionounces against a similar undertaking. Much against our will we were forcedto guarantee India&apos;s promise to repay.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India between the mare therefore liable to find some 315 million ounces of silver in the next few years.New production of silver is unlikely to provide surplus quantities sufficient toenable us to meet this obligation at reasonable prices. Therefore, we must use our silver coinage for this purpose.6. During the war, distribution for commercial needs (photography,engineering, &amp;c.) was effected through the agency of the market, which sold onhagainst undertakings as to the use of the silver supplied.7. Nothing was made available for jewellery, &amp;c, which lived on stocks and silver coming from second-hand articles. These sources dried up in 1945and recently a scheme has been evolved to allow the jewellery trade to draw somesilver from the Treasury stocks, for export purposes. The export trade is veryprofitable.8. Throughout the war the price was kept stable at 23^ pence an ounce;the American price was also fixed until 1945, since when it has been twicesharply increased. These price rises have been due to the influence of the SilverSenators, acting in the interests of American producers. There is little likelihood-hood of the prices falling heavily as they did after the last war. But theannouncement of the proposed coinage measures should cause some fall in prices,which will be in the long run to our advantage. Fluctuations must, however,be expected for some time to come.
