BRIDGESCabinet Office, S.W. 1,6TH SEPTEMBER,   1946.

PRIME MINISTER1. -As you know,  I am going to Copenhagen on Tuesdaynext, 3rd September;    I shall be returning on Saturday,7th September or Sunday,  8th September.      A decision on whether we are to de-ration bread or not at the earliest practicable moment will have to be taken (for the reasons give below) on or about 9th September.      I should therefore like to put you in possession of the main relevant facts as we see them here before I go,  so that you couldturn them over in your mind between this and the 9th.I will,  if I may, get in touch with you on the 9th to give you any developments on the situation which may occur between now and then,  and ask you for your decision.2. If we are to de-ration this autumn,  it is almostessential for rationing reasons, to do it at the end ofa ration period.      The current rationing period ends on14th September,  and the following one on 12th October.      Iftherefore we are to de-ration on 14th September a decision will have to be taken on or about the 9th.      .As enforcementwill become impossible the moment the end of rationing isannounced,  all my advisers here take the view that theannouncement should be made the night before de-rationingwithout preliminary notice. -3. Broadly, the supply position as I see it today isas follows.      United Kingdom supplies are quite easy,  as Iinformed the Cabinet  they would be, for the rest of this year.Indeed we should be able to increase our stocks appreciably.Curiously enough rny advisers tell me that the bad weatherhere has not yet caused a downward revision of our homecrop wheat receipts as estimated - I think our estimate ofthem must have been a very conservative one!4. On the other hand, we foresee the possibility of grave difficulties in the world, as distinct from thespecifically United Kingdom, wheat position re-occurring next spring and Summer,      These arise from the possibility of very heavy and apparently increasing demands from other importers,such as India,  the British and American Zones of Germany,Japan,  the Far Eastern areas for which we are responsible,i. e.  Malaya, Ceylon, Mauritius,  etc.      Most of these areasappear to take a very gloomy view of their prospects.      the trouble we foresee is,  therefore, that demands look likebeing greater than anticipated, rather than that suppliesseem shorter.5. In view of our responsibilities outside the UnitedKingdom,  I am, as I informed you,    negotiating with the canadians in the hope of arranging with them for the purchaseof an extra 40 million bushels over and above the 160 million bushels we are buying from them under our contract.      I am afraid these negotiations may be difficult, and may not besettled one way or another for some weeks yet.6. When we look further ahead,  to the New Year,  thereare the further uncertainties of the Argentine and australian wheat crops and the Far Eastern rice crops.

In a word,  it would be a bold man who would saythat we are sure that - next Spring and Summer we shallnot once more run into the same terrible wheat difficulties as we have experienced this year.      Indeed, many of myadvisers here consider that the odds are that we shall doso.^- For these reasons it could be argued that themost prudent course might be to retain bread rationingthrough the whole of this  crop year in case there shouldbe a new crisis,  and some of ray advisers favour thiscourse.I am convinced, however, that it is better forus to de-ration immediately in the hope that things will go well and we shall never have to re-impose the ration.There are so many uncertainties in forecasting the worldwheat position six or nine months ahead that I feel thatif we wait until we are assured that we shall never haveto re-impose the ration, we   may wait years.      Moreover,I feel that if we did that the world would get used toour being rationed.      Our allocations and other people&apos;sallocations would be based on our rationing requirements,and it well might become more and more,  instead of lass and less,  difficult to de-ration.      The overriding consideration in my mind is that if we had been able toavoid rationing no one would dream of    imposing it this autumn,  though we might be feeling misgivings about next spring and summer.8. An additional consideration which weighs with me is this.      Many of my advisers on the internalrationing side strongly take the view that it would bebetter to de-ration now, even if it were certain thatwe should have to ration again next spring and summer.They take this view because they believe that well,  onthe whole,  as the scheme has worked up to now,  it willbe extremely difficult to continue to enforce it this autumn and winter.      The political campaign which has beenwaged against it has,  they fear,  under-mined some importantparts of it,  and may make it very difficult to enforce thecollection of Bread Units on bakers.      They take the viewthat it would be administratively much easier,   if necessary,to start again in the late spring and summer with all theexperience of this scheme behind them, rather than toattempt to patch the present structure.      They would much prefer to de-ration on 14th September rather than 12thOctober for these reasons.9. The announcement of the end of rationing wouldstress    (a)    the extraordinary success of the scheme insaving flour:    so far the flour usage each week,  compared to a pre-rationing usage of 104 thousand tons has been73,  69, 63,  76,  78.- - (b)    the urgent need for continuedeconomy (in view of the world situation) if we are tokeep off a re-imposition of rationing.10. I propose to get hold of the bakers and have asked my advisers to try to work out a scheme of moreor less voluntary &quot;target rationing&quot; by means of whichwe can try to hold the weekly usage of flour down tosay 90 thousand tons - now that we know that the nationcan very well do on below 80 thousand I

11. As you know,  I hoped to he able to recommendthat we should lower the extraction rate from 90% to85% at the same time as de-rationing.      In view of the apparent worsening of the position on the demand side(e.g.   India&apos;s increased demands) I most reluctantly feelthat we ought not to lower the extraction rate as wellas de-ration in the immediate future, but of course Ishall take the very first opportunity possible torecommend that we should do so.      (indeed if we can getthose extra 40 million bushels secure from Canada Ithink we should be justified - other things being equal -in doing so. )12. I am sure that I need not  emphasise to you thatif we de-ration now,  all our hopes of remaining de-rationedwill rest on us preserving the basic minimum United Kingdomsupplies of wheat and resisting diversions no matter howpressing the demand..13. I therefore recommend that we should announce the end of bread rationing (and its consequential changesin the rationing schemes,  such as the taking of oatmealand flour products off points) as from Saturday,  14thSeptember,  the announcement to be made twenty-four hoursbeforehand.      But I feel that it will be only prudent thatin the announcement we tell the public quite frankly thatit might be necessary to re-introduce the rationing schemenext spring or summer.      I should of course link ourappeal for strict economy to this warning.      We can,of course, describe the uncertainties of the world situation which make this caution inevitable.      Thiswill be an unpalatable feature in the announcement, butI feel that it will be invaluable to have stated thisif the worst comes to the worst and we do have to re-impose bread rationing some time next year.J.S.2nd September,1946
