The Cabinet have invited us to exprviews on the question of illegal immigration into palestine.   These are as follows.2.    We consider that, from the military point ofview, illegal immigration should be s topped.   If itis not stopped we will, in our opinion, be committed to a war on two fronts against both Arabs and Jews.For such, a commitment we have not sufficient forces,uniess the release scheme is stopped.3.     A ship (HAGANAH) containing 2,700 illegal immigrants was towed into Haifa yesterday.      Inaddition, the ships listed at Annex are reported as having left, or being about to leave, forPalestine.    An immediate decision is thereforerequired o4.     In our view the best solution is to stop illegal immigration at source or&apos; at ports en route.      Wetherefore recommend that the Foreign Office shouldcontinue to exert the greatest pressure on the foreign government from, whose ports the ships are scheduledto start or to call,5.     It was suggested at the Meeting of the cabinet this morning that we ourselves might take direct action at certain ports, e.g. Genoa and the Piraeus.   This,however, is not possible, as we have not the necessaryforces at the ports or in their vicinity.6.     It has also been suggested that ships containingillegal immigrants might be intercepted at sea anddiverted to some port other than Palestine.   Apartfrom the legal difficulties, this is a scarcelypracticable operation on the high seas.

7.     In any event it seems quite clear that whatever precautions are taken, whether atsource or en route, some of the ships willslip through to Palestine.   The problem,therefore, is first to find, a place to whichthe passengers can be sent, and secondly, to devise a means of&quot; getting them there without their setting foot in Palestine.8a    As regards the first problem, this is apolitical matter, but obviously the nearer theplace is to Palestine the better.   From themilitary angle, Cyprus would be the mostsuitable, as already having a garrison to providetho   necessary guards and as being near to palestine, and thus ensuring economy in shipping.9.     As to the problem of getting the immigrants to whatever place may be decided upon, the onlypossibility seems to be to have special british shipping available into which the passengers&apos;could be embarked direct from their originalships by the local police, assisted by the armed forces.&apos; This would almost inevitably involve the use of force:   and this must be ,faced.10.   Provided that H.M. Government make a public announcement of their determination to stopillegal immigration once and for all and of the steps which they propose to that end:   and provide-.!   that the whole problem is explained tothe U.S.A. and their co-operation, or at, leasttheir goodwill, secured, there seems to be areasonable chance of a successful outcome.(Signed)     TEDDERMONTGOMERY OF ALAMEINRHODERICK McGRIGOR(V.C.N.S.)Offices of the Cabinet, S.W.1.29TH JULY, 1946.
