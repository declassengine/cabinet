(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos; S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.SECRETCP.(46)  5596TH SEPTEMBER,   1946CABINETINDIAN FOOD REQUIREMENTSMemorandum by Se c r etary of State for Indi a&quot;(&quot;Addendum to C.p7( 46)528 of Slid September^The figures for estimated arrivals of&apos;fcodgrains atIndian ports shown in the appendix to my memorandum(C.P.(46) 52S)  of 2nd September should now be amended asfollows as the result of information which has become available since my memorandum was circulated:-Estimated arrivals during September-OctoberTurkish barleyIraq,   barleyBurma riceCanadian wheat(Pacific Coast)Totaldeduct 10,000 tonsadd 12,000 tonsadd 16,000 tonsadd 9,000 tonsadd 27.000 tons estimated arrivals during NovemberArgentine rnaizeIraq, barleyU.N.R.R.A.  wheat diversionsCanadian wheat(Pacific Coast)Totaldeduct 40,000 tonsadd 17,000 tonsadd 25,000 tonsadd 26,000 tonsadd 26,000 tons2.      There are also the following further possibilitiesof diversions to India from European countries which are toouncertain to be taken into account at present:-For October arrival in IndiaBelgium8,000 tons of Argentine maize sorghums now afloat.For November arrival in IndiaSwitzerland8,000 tons United States flour.Norway8,000 tons Argentine maize.

3.      It is thus possible to reduce to 126,000 tons (oron the very best assumptions 113,000 tons) the gap of153,000 tons for arrival in India in September/October,mentioned in paragraph 2 of G.P.(46)328 as requiredin order to bring average  stocks in India up to a levelequal to five weeks&apos;   off take.      Similarly, estimatedsupplies in November should now be increased by 28,000tons(or on the best assumptions by 44,000 tons).4.      In connection with the above figures t-(a) The shipments from the Canadian Pacific Coast of9,000 tons of wheat for October arrival and 26,000tons for November arrival are rendered possible by the Ministry of Pood having agreed to releasethis wheat for India from supplies new destined for the United Kingdom for September  shipment inreturn for additional wheat to be provided by canada for shipment from the St.  Lawrence for october shipment.      It is however  not yet certainthat shipping can be found in September for allthese four cargoes from the Pacific Coast.(b) Only 32,000 tons  out  of the 140,000 tons of argentine maize,  etc.  estimated in the appendix to cp. (4-6) 528 for arrival in India in Novemberare as yet covered by export  licences,  and theMinistry of Transport are not prepared to nominatetonnage for  the remaining 108,000 tons untilexport  licences have been granted.      Even ifthese are issued within the next few days, it is unlikely that ships could now be got into positionquickly enough to enable more  than 100,000 tons(as compared with the 140,COO tons previouslyestimated.) to arrive in India before the end ofNovember.( c) Canada might be able to make  two or possibly threecargoes of wheat available to India in the st, Lawrence during September in addition toany supplies mentioned above.      It is understood,however,  that these unfortunately could not be shipped to India since British shipping is alreadyfully committed on other programmes and Americanships are not prep:&apos;:red to load in the St. Lawrence.(d) Lord Killearn has independently revised hisprogramme for the shipment of Burma rice inSeptember on lines similar to those  suggestedin paragraph 7( i)  of the note attached to cp. (46)  328,  so that it will all be divided between India and other areas of british responsibility in South East Asia.      This,under the instructions of the official committee  on Pood Supplies from South East Asia,is being reported to the I.E.F.O.  for theircovering approval.      It is likely to increasearrivals in India during September/October byabout 16,000 tons.

5. On. the&apos; other hand the strike of seamen and dockers atAmerican ports may hold up substantial quantities of graindestined for India if it cent the best asubstantial gap exists,  as is indicated in para. 3 above,between prospective arrivals in India and what I estimated in CP. (46) 338 to be necessary.      Moreover, my estimateof what is necessary is considerably below that of theGovernment of India, who wish to maintain an averagestock of six weeks&apos;   off take (about 900,000 tons).      i therefore feel bound to ask the Cabinet to consider most seriously the proposal in CP. (46) 328 for the diversion to India of up to 100,000 tons of wheat out ofSeptember shipments from Canada at present destined forthe United Kingdom.P.L.India Office,6TH SEPTEMBER,  1946.
