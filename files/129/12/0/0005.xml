(46) 305.29th July, 1946.CABINET.CHANGES IN BRITISH NATIONALITY LAW.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.THE Canadian Citizenship Bill, which was introduced in the canadian parliament in October last, has now passed all the stages and received theroyal assent. The Canadian Act, which is to come into operation on the1st January, 1947, introduces a fundamental change in the system of british nationality law at present in operation throughout the British Commonwealth.2. Under the existing system the common status of British subject ismaintained throughout the Commonwealth by a single common code of nationalitylaw. The Canadian Act abrogates the existing common code provisions asregards Canada, and introduces a new principle by first defining the persons whoare to be Canadian citizens and then declaring that Canadian citizens are Britishsubjects. Provision is also made for the recognition as British subjects underCanadian law of all persons who are British subjects under the law of any other member of the Commonwealth listed in the First Schedule to the Act. Underthis system, therefore, the common status of British subject is based, not uponthe provisions of a common code, but upon the possession of the local citizenship of the particular member of the Commonwealth.3. This fundamental change of system on the part of Canada makes itnecessary to consider whether any changes should be made in the nationality laws of the United Kingdom and the other members of the Commonwealth, either inthe direction of the adoption of the Canadian citizenship system or otherwise,with a view to maintaining the common status of British subject unimpairedthroughout the Commonwealth.4. With this end in view, the Home Secretary in his memorandum cp. (45) 287 of the 16th November, 1945, submitted to the Cabinet a proposal fora meeting of experts from the several countries of the British Commonwealth toconsider the far-reaching issues raised by the Canadian action. The proposal was approved by the Cabinet see CM. (45) 55th Conclusions, paragraph 5 onthe 22nd November, 1945, and has now been agreed to in principle by the otherGovernments concerned. There was some discussion of the proposal at the meetings of United Kingdom and Dominion officials which were held in london on the 30th and 31st May, 1946, following a decision at the meeting of PrimeMinisters, for the purpose of discussing informally nationality questions ofcommon concern. All the officials present were agreed that it was desirable thatthe experts conference should be held later in the year, not earlier than the endof September, and that papers relating to the problems to be discussed shouldbe prepared and exchanged before the conference took place. Arrangements are accordingly being made, subject to the agreement of the Dominion Governments,to hold the experts conference in London in late October or early November ofthis year.. 5. Before the preliminary papers can be prepared or the detailed instruc-tions for the United Kingdom representatives settled, it will be necessary for theCabinet to decide certain major questions of policy, viz. : (a) whether the United Kingdom is to participate in the new citizenshipsystem and, if so,(b) what form that participation should take;&apos;[32201] b
2(c) in connection with the latter point, the manner in which the UnitedKingdom, the Colonies, India, Burma, Newfoundland and SouthernRhodesia are to be brought within the new citizenship scheme; and(d) the solution of certain special difficulties arising from the somewhatanomalous position of Eire.6. These decisions will involve a somewhat detailed consideration of constitutional and legal problems of a rather intricate and technical nature,which are dealt with in the annexed memorandum. In view of this our colleagues may wish to appoint a sub-committee to consider the detailed questions raised in the attached memorandum and report thereon to the Cabinet. If our colleagues should be so minded, we would suggest that the sub-committee be composed of the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary ofState for India and Burma, together with the Minister of State and theA tto r ney- General.J. C. E.A.Whitehall, S.W. 1,29th July, 1946.ANNEX.Statement of the Considerations involved in the Proposed Changes inBritish Nationality Law.I- Introductory: reasons why it is necessary for the United Kingdom Governmentto make these changes.1. The Canadian Citizenship Act, which is thus to come into force on the1st January, 1947, is the immediate cause which has led to the necessity for a consideration of the changes in British nationality law proposed in this Memoran-dum. The Act makes a fundamental alteration, as far as Canada is concerned,in the existing system by which the common status of British subject is main-tained throughout the Commonwealth. Hitherto the common status has been maintained by a common code, formed by the British Nationality Act and Actspassed by all the other members of the Commonwealth, with the sole exceptionof Eire, which are substantial counterparts of the United Kingdom Act. The main-tenance of this common code has been reinforced by the principle, having the forceof a convention of Imperial constitutional law, that substantial amendments ofthe common code are matters for prior consultation and agreement between themembers of the Commonwealth. This necessity for prior consultation and agree-ment has led to an unsatisfactory state of affairs in that it has given rise toprolonged delays and, in some cases, virtual abandonment of much-needed amend-ments in the law. Indeed, the existing framework of the common code had shownevident signs of breaking down, even before the introduction of the Canadian bill the fact that the Canadian Government failed to take the prior step of consulta-tion and agreement before introducing a Bill involving such fundamental changesin the common code is itself of some sigificance as an indication of a breakdown in the working of the principles underlying the present system.2. The Canadian Act introduces a new method of legislating on the subjectof British nationality in that it first defines what classes of persons are Canadiancitizens, and then declares that Canadian citizens are British subjects, at thesame time, recognising as British subjects in Canada all persons who are Britishsubjects under the law of any other member listed in the First Schedule. Thus,in addition to the breakdown, noticed above, in the existing machinery for themaintenance of the common status, the Canadian Act also makes a clear breakin the unity of method by which that common status is maintained throughoutthe Commonwealth. Unless some action is taken, there will henceforward existwithin the Commonwealth two distinct, and to some extent conflicting, systems bywhich the common status is maintained. The United Kingdom Government are accordingly faced with the paramount necessity of avoiding this undesirablesituation and of taking action with a view to substituting for the present system a  new and more workable one.
3 ihe scheme underlying the Canadian Act, which it is suggested might beadopted by all the members of the Commonwealth as the basis of their futurenationality legislation, is briefly as follows(a) Each member of the Commonwealth (including the United Kingdom andcertain other territories which it is suggested should have the rightto enact their own citizenship laws, viz., India, Burma, Newfound-land and Southern Rhodesia) would define in its Citizenship Act thepersons who are its &quot; citizens,&quot; and would provide that all its citizensare British subjects.(b) Each member would also provide reciprocally for the recognition as british subjects of persons who are British subjects under the law of any other member. This would necessitate the inclusion in theCitizenship Act of each member of a Schedule (which it is suggestedmight be the First Schedule in each Act) giving a list of the othermembers and of any other territories which are to be recognised as having the right to enact citizenship laws.The Australian Government have already indicated that they accept inprinciple the Canadian system and that it will be adopted in Australia in due course. It is thought that the South African Government will be likely to take up a similar attitude.4. It may be contended that the creation of a United Kingdom citizenshipis unnecessary and inexpedient; that for the purposes of the domestic law theUnited Kingdom has no need to define its citizens, and that the creation of thisstatus would serve no useful purpose and would perplex Parliament and thepublic. On the other hand, if the fait accompli brought about by the passing ofthe Canadian Act is not followed by action on similar lines on the part of all theother members of the Commonwealth (including the United Kingdom) it isdifficult to see how the common status could be maintained for any length of time.If there is to be no United Kingdom citizenship, the United Kingdom would continue to base acquisition and loss of British nationality substantially on theexisting code, conferring by direct grant, without the interpolation of citizenship,the status of British subject. Meanwhile, the other members of the Common-wealth, who would presumably have adopted the Canadian system, would definewhat persons are their citizens and declare those citizens to be British subjects,i.e., the common status of British subject would be conferred through the gatewayof citizenship. The existence of such a situation would be undesirable from morethan one point of view. There would no longer be any agreed basis for thecommon status of British subject. The Commonwealth would, in effect, be dividedinto two camps, each having a different method of determining the common status and this would give rise to anomalies and divergencies with regard to the uniformrecognition of the common status, which would be found to become more markedwith the passage of time. Again, since the United Kingdom would be conferringthe status of British subject directly and not through the gateway of UnitedKingdom citizenship, the term &quot; British subject&quot; might, from the point of viewof the more &apos;: advanced&quot; Dominions, e.g., Canada, tend to be too intimatelyconnected with a status directly conferred upon the inhabitants of the UnitedKingdom by the Parliament at Westminster, and to be regarded for this reason asa reflection on Dominion nationhood. In these circumstances one or more of theDominions might feel obliged to give way to demands from within for completelyseparate nationhood and to drop the common status from its Citizenship Act,thus severing the main link in the allegiance to the Crown which the commonstatus implies.5. In view of these dangers we would suggest that it is virtually imperative that the United Kingdom should participate in the proposed new citizenshipsystem, and that the status of British subject should be conferred by the UnitedKingdom, in common with the other members of the Commonwealth, through thegateway of citizenship.TL-Treatment of the Colonies under the New Citizenship System.1. United Kingdom participation in the proposed Commonwealth citizen-ship system, which, for the reasons given in Part I above, we would suggest is a necessary step, involves important questions of Colonial policy. A good deal of consideration has already been given to these questions and a number of alterna-tive methods of handling the problem in relation to the Colonies have been[32201] b 2
considered. But the Secretary of State for the Colonies has not yet reached any definite conclusions, and it is, we understand, his intention to circulate a paper on this subject.Ill- Treatment of India, Burma, Newfoundland and Soiithern Rhodesia underthe New Citizenship System.1. The position of India in relation to the new citizenship plan is to someextent rendered obscure by the present constitutional uncertainty. The obscurity,however, may to some extent be cleared up by taking in turn the possible out-comes of the present negotiations. If India attains an independent status andelects to leave the Commonwealth, no question of her place in the Commonwealthcitizenship framework will arise. If, on the other hand, she remains within theCommonwealth, we would suggest that action should be taken by the UnitedKingdom Government in the following sense.Under the existing law, India and Burma have no power to enact theirown laws affecting British nationality. The power was expressly reserved tothe Parliament at Westminster by Acts of 1935 under which their presentconstitutions were established. Whatever the outcome of the present constitu-tional negotiations, we would suggest, subject to the concurrence of the Secretaryof State for India and Burma, that India should, if she remains within theCommonwealth, and subject to any necessary and proper safeguards, be giventhe right to enact her own citizenship and nationality laws, including the rightto confer on her citizens the common status of British subject, and that a similarcourse should, in any event, be followed in the ease of Burma. If our colleagues are agreed upon this, it would follow that India and Burma would be includedin the First Schedule to the United Kingdom Citizenship Act.2. Though defined in the Statute of Westminster and other legislation asa Dominion, Newfoundland has not, for reasons which are well-known, enjoyedself-government in recent years. Nevertheless, we would suggest that in thematter of citizenship Newfoundland should, as indeed on legal grounds she must,be treated as a Dominion.3. We would further suggest that Southern Rhodesia should be placed inthe First Schedule to the United Kingdom Citizenship Act. There will be no necessity in her case to confer upon her any new right to legislate for nationalitypurposes, as, subject to one point of detail relating to exterritoriality, she alreadypossesses sufficient powers in this connection.4. If our colleagues are agreed that India, Burma, Newfoundland and southern Rhodesia should be allowed to enact their own citizenship legislationunder the new plan, it would seem to follow that these four countries should beinvited to send representatives to the experts conference. We would accordinglysuggest, subject to the agreement of the Secretary of State for India and Burma,that India and Burma, as well as Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesia, shouldbe invited, at the appropriate time, to send representatives to the expertsconference.IV. Special Problems in connection with Eire.1. United Kingdom participation in the new citizenship scheme would raisein a direct form certain difficulties in connection with the somewhat anomaloussituation of Eire within the Commonwealth as regards nationality matters.The existing Eire nationality legislation, passed in 1935, while defining thepersons who are Eire citizens, does not provide that such persons are Britishsubjects and in fact repeals in relation to Eire both the British Nationality Actsand the common law under which Eire citizens had hitherto possessed the status of British subject. Under United Kingdom law, however, Eire citizens continue,with a very few exceptions, to be British subjects. This position has met with strong criticism from Mr. de valera, who has gone so far as publicly to stigmatiseas an impertinence the claim of the United Kingdom Government to treat eire citizens as British subjects. This is possibly no doubt due to objection to the term&quot; British subject &quot; as such but in the main it rests upon the fact that the status of British subject connotes an allegiance to the Crown which is wholly incon-sistent with Mr. de Valera&apos;s conception of the position of Eire in relation to theCommonwealth.2. There is accordingly no prospect that Eire will now legislate to provide that Eire citizens are British subjects.   The new citizenship plan is based upon
the principle that each member of the Commonwealth will declare its own citizensto be British subjects and will recognise as British subjects all persons who are british subjects under the law of any other member. The adoption without qualification of this plan by the United Kingdom would accordingly have theeffect that Eire citizens would in the United Kingdom (or elsewhere in the Com-commonwealth) no longer be British subjects, in spite of the fact that Eire would beincluded in the First Schedule, as, indeed, we feel she must be.There is no doubt that such legislation, having the result that Eire citizensare no longer British subjects in the United Kingdom, would be very distastefulto many people and would provoke questions as to the position of Eire within theCommonwealth. On the other hand, to perpetuate in new legislation a situationin which Eire citizens are not British subjects in their own country but are suchin another country against the wishes of their own Government, would not onlybe anomalous but might lead to serious friction with the Government of Eire.We see no alternative therefore but so to frame our legislation that Eire citizenswill not, subject to the possible preservation of existing rights (referred to inparagraph 4 below), be British subjects.3. It is not considered that this would substantially affect in principle the somewhat special status of Eire as a member of the Commonwealth. The links between the members of the Commonwealth are various and the common allegiance to the Crown of British subjects is only one of them, though as one of the few remaining legal bonds a specially important one. Adoption of the coursedescribed above means only that in the case of Eire this particular bond, whichEire itself has long repudiated, is not insisted on by the other members; but theother links will remain.4. In considering the consequences of the adoption of this policy, underwhich Eire citizens will no longer be British subjects in the United Kingdom,we feel, howrever, that there is a question of principle involved as regards personsborn before the proposed United Kingdom citizenship legislation comes intooperation. These persons will have already acquired the status of British subjectunder the existing United Kingdom law quite independently of their status as eire citizens under the law of Eire. Special hardship would attach to those bornbefore 1922, who were British subjects by birth before Eire came into existenceas a separate member of the Commonwealth. Many Eire citizens resident in Eire. itself are friendly to this country and are jealous of their status of British subjectunder United Kingdom law. A considerable number of them volunteered andserved with distinction in the British forces in the two wars. Persons of this class would undoubtedly be resentful if, as a result of the new legislation, theylost their status as British subjects under United Kingdom law.One method of dealing with the problem so as to avoid any deprivation ofthese acquired rights would be by means of a saving provision, on the lines ofsection 46 of the Canadian Act, which would prevent any person who is a british subject under United Kingdom law at the date of the commencement of the newcitizenship legislation from losing that status. A general saving provision ofthis nature would give rise to technical difficulties which would call for examina-tion at the experts meeting.5. In default of such a general saving clause, or possibly in addition, itwould be necessary to have special provisions in the United Kingdom legislationenabling Eire citizens in the service of the Crown or resident in this country orthe Colonies when the legislation comes into force to acquire citizenship of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies without undue formality.Again it will be necessary to consider inserting provisions in the new legis-lation, on strict condition of reciprocity, under which Eire citizens born afterthe date of the coming into force of that legislation, though not British subjects,would be given all the rights of British subjects whilst they are in this country or the Colonies.All these are questions of legislative detail which we would suggest could properly be left, as regards the working out of the final detailed solution, to the experts conference.6. Accordingly, we suggest that the United Kingdom representatives at the experts meeting should be instructed that any necessary legislation by the UnitedKingdom in pursuance of an agreed new citizenship system would have to beso framed that the status of British subject would not be forced upon Eire citizensagainst the wishes of their own Government. If our colleagues are so agreed onthe main question of policy, we would further suggest that they might generally
approve of instructions being given to the United Kingdom representatives atthe experts conference to work out detailed provisions, either on the lines of theproposals suggested above or in any other practicable way, to meet the sense of hardship and grievance which might well be felt by persons belonging to Eirewho would otherwise be deprived of their status as British subjects under UnitedKingdom law.V. Ei&amp;perts Conference.1. While Cabinet authority has been given for the holding, of the expertsconference, no date for the conference has yet been arranged with the DominionGovernments. At the informal discussions between United Kingdom and dominion officials which took place in London in May there was general agreement on the desirability of holding the conference later in.the year, not earlier thanthe end of September. The matter has now become one of some urgency, sincethe Canadian Act is to come into force on the 1st January, 1947, and it isclearly desirable that there should be agreement amongst the members of theCommonwealth regarding the adoption of some new and workable scheme before that date. In order to leave time for the various Governments to study the reportof the experts conference and to interchange the necessary communicationsexpressing their concurrence, it would seem that the conference must be held,if possible, not later than the first fortnight in November.Communications are accordingly being sent to the Dominion governments with a view to securing their agreement to the convening of the experts conferencein London on a date between the third week in October and the second week inNovember of this year.A great deal of work has to be done prior to the conference in settling theinstructions of the United Kingdom representatives as well as in the preparationof the preliminary papers which are to be exchanged. &quot;We would emphasise that this preliminary work must necessarily await the decision of the Governmenton the broad questions of policy raised in this Memorandum.2. A further point arises to which reference should be made in connectionwith the experts meeting. The general principles of an amendment of the law relating to the nationality of married women were recently approved by theCabinet see CM. (46) 62nd Conclusions, paragraph 6. This amendment hasnow been agreed to in principle by the Governments of Canada, Australia andNew Zealand, and the concurrence of the South African Government is expected in due course. In addition to its other work in connection with the new citizenshipsystem, the experts conference will be concerned to work out the details of theamendment, which has thus been agreed in principle. It might be considered desirable that this amendment of the law relating to the nationality of marriedwomen should not be the subject of prior separate legislation, but should be incorporated in the United Kingdom citizenship legislation which will become necessary if our colleagues approve the suggestions put forward in this Memo-randum.   This is a matter, however, which can only be decided at a later stage.3. We should also mention that the points to be considered at the expertsconference are not confined to the major questions arising out of this Memorandumon which the views of the Cabinet are sought. It is desirable that opportunity should be taken at the experts conference to consider various detailed amendments of the existing law, which have been found necessary as a result of experienceover the last thirty years in the administration of the present nationality law.VI. Conclusions.For the reasons set out in detail above, we suggest to our colleagues : (1) that it is desirable that the United Kingdom should participate in theproposed new Commonwealth system;(2) that this should be done by the creation in United Kingdom legislation of some form of citizenship which would be the gateway through which the status of British subject would be conferred upon theinhabitants of the United Kingdom and, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, upon the inhabitants ofthe Colonies, though the precise form of this citizenship in relation tothe Colonies would, of course, be dependent upon the considerations of Colonial policy which will be raised in the memorandum to besubmitted by the Secretary of State for the Colonies;
(3) that India (if she is to remain within the Commonwealth), Burma, New-foundland and Southern Rhodesia should be brought within the frame-work of the new system as countries having the right to enact theirown citizenship legislation, and that India and Burma should begiven the right to do so;(4) that in the United Kingdom citizenship legislation the status of british subject should not be automatically conferred upon Eire citizensagainst the wishes of the Eire Government, but that certain detailed provisions for insertion in the United Kingdom Act should be worked out at the experts conference so as to avoid the hardship which would otherwise result from the fact that Eire citizens will no longer be british subjects under United Kingdom law;(5) that, as well as all the members of the Commonwealth (including Eire),the Governments of India, Burma, Newfoundland and SouthernRhodesia should be invited to send representatives to the experts con-ference, which we hope will be held in October or November of thisyear.
