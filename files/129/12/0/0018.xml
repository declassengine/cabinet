(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(46)   5182ND AUGUST,  1946CABINETUNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT FOR EIRE CITIZENSAFTER SERVICE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM forces memorandum by the Lord Privy seal.     At their meeting on 21st March (CM. (46)  26th Conclusions,Minute 1), the Cabinet approved a proposal^ that Eire volunteerswho had enlisted in the United Kingdom Forces should beentitled to payment of unemployment insurance benefit in Eirein respect of any contribution credited to them during their service in the Forces, subject to satisfactory arrangements asto the offer of suitable jobs in this country to those inreceipt of such benefit in Eire.2.     A series of conferenceshave taken place between officials ofthe Dominions Office,  the Ministry of Labour and National Serviceand the Ministry of National Insurance, together with an observer from Northern Ireland and representatives of the EireDepartments.      The Minister of National Insurance had submittedto the Social Services Committee the annexed draft agreement which has been initialled by our official representatives onbehalf of the United Kingdom Government.3.      The agreement achieves broadly the intention of theCabinet, namely that ex-service men and &quot;women who have served in our forces and return to Eire after demobilisation will beable to obtain unemployment benefit in Eire subject to the satisfaction of contribution conditions in force in. GreatBritain.      It is intended that the agreement should run for aperiod of two years from the date of operation and that paymentof benefit should be at rates payable in Great Britain with the qualification that increase of benefit will be paid for notmore than two children in a family.4.      Administration in Eire will be undertaken by the Eireauthorities who will apply their own rules for the receiptof benefit.      These rules however approximate very closely to our own and the official representatives are satisfiedthat the Eire authorities intend to apply them strictly.5.      The Eire authorities are under legal obligation to givecertain preferences to their own ex-Defence Force men, but,subject to this,  they would undertake to offer suitable employment to beneficiaries under the agreement on the same basis as for claimants to their own benefits.copy no.      r^oj6    CP.

6,      It will be recalled that in the course of the discussion at the cabinet referred to in paragraph 1 above, some importance was attached, to the proposal that arrangements should be made under which offers of employment in thiscountry could be mad,.; to claimants in Eire.      This proposal was fully explored, with the Eire representatives whoexpressed themselves entirely willing to discuss with uspossible means of co-operation in this matter.      Therepresentatives of the Ministry of labour and National Serviceand of the Eire Department of Industry and-Commerce pointedout,  on the basis of long experience, however, that there weregreat practical difficulties in operating any formal scheme under which vacancies in Great Britain would be offered as amatter of rule to claimants in Eire under the agreement.      TheMinistry of Labour and. National Service also felt that anysuch general arrangement would complicate the continuedworking of the present scheme under which it is hoped to attract to this country substantial numbers of Eire workers ona voluntary basis.     . (It is, for example, hoped to make arrangements to bring over substantial numbers of workers from eire for work in the mines.)7.      It was agreed that the offering of individual vacanciesfor workers with particular skills or qualifications shouldbe  considered, as a matter of day to day administration betweenthe Departments concerned in Great Britain and Eire when thescheme comes into force, and in the discussion the Eirerepresentatives made it clear that they were prepared toco-operate closely with us in practical working.8.     Legislation will be required in both countries to makethe agreement effective.      So far as this country is concerned,a very short enabling Bill giving powers to make such arrangement with consequential modifications and financialadjustment of the existing unemployment insurance scheme is all that would be necessary.      It is important that thearrangement, if it is to benefit ex-Service men in Eire,should be operated as soon as possible and at any ratebefore the end of this year.      It is very desirable, therefore,that time for the Bill should be found in the concludingdays of the present Session after the Recess,9.     At the same time we feel that we must bring before our colleagues a number of considerations, which may form thebasis of criticism of the arrangements in the House of Commonswhen the Bill is introduced.10,   First, the Government are in the hands of the Eireauthorities for control of expenditure from United Kingdom fundIt may be argued, for example,&apos; that even though the Eireauthorities do not administer their rules more leniently whenthey are dealing with cases of returned ex-United KingdomService men than when they - are dealing with their ownunemployed, we cannot be sure that their general standards ofadministration tire as high,  or the rules as stringently appliedas they would be in this country.      Moreover, in cases where an offer of employment in this  country has been made andrefused, it may well bo said that a plea by an applicant for benefit&quot;that the job was unsuitable or that he was immobilewould be accepted more readily by an Eire Court of Refereesthan it would be by a similar Court in this country.

11.    It may also be argued that in some parts of Eire,particularly the more remote rural areas where the standards of living are low in comparison with the United Kingdom,the normal incentive for a returned ex-Service man entitledto British rates of benefit will be lacking and that  in effect in such cases will be the normal practice for a man to look upon the 100 days unemployment benefit to which he is entitledas an automatic grant in supplementation of his 56 daysterminal leave pay.      it might, therefore, be said that we arepermitting volunteers from Eire to receive more favourable treatment than volunteers from this country, where arestandards of administration and our general economic conditionboth operate to prevent such abuses.12.    As against this, however, the agreement limits paymentof benefit in Eire to 180 days and does not provide for thepayment of the added days which would normally be payable inthis country and which in many cases would extentd the period to 500 days.     There is -reason to believe that the standards of administratively/lon, particularly in relation to offers ofsuitable employment, are in. some respects more severe in Eirethan in this country and that these standards will be appliedto the ex-Service men covered by the agreement in the same way as to other applicants for benefit in Eire.     There is no doubt,too, that these ex-Service men are to some extent handicapped by their record in the search for employment in Eire.13.    We do not suggest that it is possible at this stage toavoid all the potential difficulties we have mentioned by administrative safeguards.      They are probably inherent to -a greater or less degree in any scheme which has necessarilyto be left to another Government to operate.      In any case, itmust be remembered that the scheme is not one to assist the eire Government but to ensure that persons who have served thiscountry in His Majesty&apos;s Forces receive fair treatment on demobilisation.      On general grounds it would, seem most undesirable to endeavour to reopen discussion on the agreement which hasbeen initialled and which substantially secures the benefits which, as the prime minister and the Lord Chancellor havestated in parliament;, the United Kingdom Government are anxiousto see conferred as early as possible on those who served thiscountry in time of need.The Social Services Commivoee feel, however, that before a decision it taken to introduce legislation to implement theagreement, the Cabinet should be aware of the considerations whichhave been raised and of the possibility that the arrangements may be open to critlsm from some quarters in Parliament,though it is fair to say that they are likely to receive strongsuppo!^! from other quarters.(Initialled)    A.G.Cabinet Office, S..W.1.2ND AUGUST,  1946.
